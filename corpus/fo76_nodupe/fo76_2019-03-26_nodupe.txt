Is it good against players? Or just pretty much everything? I have an explosive one, but I just wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs worth carrying around all the time with the reload speed.
---
---
---
What a well written, yet downvoted post.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll tell if I need help lol.
---
Ok that's fine 
---
I sometimes wait outside vault 76 for someone to pop out so I can give them 50+ Stims Bobby pins some heavy leather and deck out there pipe weapons the happy jumps and stuff I get makes me feel pretty good. And if I got nothing else to do I‚Äôll escort them to flatwoods
---
While I doubt they will give us a free steam keys they did give PC players Skyrim Special Edition for free if they already owned the original Skyrim with all its DLC. Keep in mind though that was all within Steam so idk if Bethesda could do this even if they wanted to but it‚Äôs still slightly possible.
---
This happened to me with the Monster Mask. I took as many as I could and distributed them all over the map on as many servers as I could. Had a couple thousand left when they did the purge and they took all but 1 from my inventory. 
---
I have often wondered the same thing, but don't really see a difference with more than one.  I like the combat armor and most of what I have on is chameleon, but I have other pieces like the heath restore, vanguard and unyielding and think I might start mixing and matching. I think one piece is all you need with the exception of additional 2 and 3\* perks you get.
---
Agreed. I hadn‚Äôt traveled to these locations in like 50 levels. Had fun revisiting. Now if only I can find some x-01 armor but I fear it doesn‚Äôt spawn in the wild lol

It's been done a lot. It makes the little animals you need for intestines not spawn in the nuked zone, so it's easy to fail the event, and it makes it so not everyone can do the event (because not all the low levels have power armor or hazmat suits). It's kind of a dick move unless you know everyone on the server. 
---
My friend has a scarecrow and it didnt stop attacks, but it did make them all attack the scarecrow so it's easier for her to defend the place.
---
thats cool
---
Nah, I play with plenty of players who play like noobs. It's all good.
---
If one of those masks had a child I guess you could say it was ...*Son of the Mask*
---
It's really useful if you do something stupid like try to fight the SBQ with most of your guns broken and waste all 1000 of the rounds you had for your favorite gun on it, lmao

"The duping issue was caused by Bethesda being lazy with their programming. Banning people fro trading... (...)"
---
No, the duping issue was caused by those who manipulated the flaws of a code to gain an advantage. If only those who aren't banned now were the only ones playing at the time the duping exploit was active, there would be no duping issue at all, because none of us would be exploiting.
---
when i kill them, its just so they wont have a bounty anymore. I dont take their loot.
---
hi there. same happened to me, but with the difference that i recently created a new acc. but it is made of numbers and letters. i opened a support ticket to ask. i thought i am the only one with that problem. just wanted to let you know you are not the only one.
---
THIS! Seriously, enough with this shit. 
---
God i saw the first one yesterday im screamed and woke my parents up
---
Im thinking they'll tune some of the effect stacking, and maybe do some perk tweaks. Making serendipity like ricochet in that it doesn't work for pvp would be a good one, and maybe shorting the interaction between bloodied and unyielding. 
---
That said, gamma gun
---
That's an Aappaallaacchhoonn Kooter. 13" or have to throw him back.
---
Legendaries are common and not special now. This would make you have to work for them, while taking away the random chance involved in getting to where you want to go.
---
It also makes sense that a weapon only becomes Legendary from you using it in legendary ways.
---
I had an event like that the pinhead kept bossing me around. Demanding I get on a roof because of my marsupial mutation. 
---
I don‚Äôt. Instead I whip out my laser rifle and start making ash of the mutants.  So we get to sloth and I ash him and the pinhead starts screaming at me because we can‚Äôt ‚Äúloot‚Äù the sloth. 
---
Tl;dr a really nice girl on mic returns fire on him and ashes him. 
---
I wish I had that much ammo for my handmade. They gave me about 5-600
---
Harpers Ferry if you need violet flux. I nuked morgantown airport, it was fun. Helvetia before Fasbacht ends would be entertaining. 
---
Crouching in chameleon armor or the chameleon mutation, stealth boys, and the like. 
---
In fact we only need to write down names of others players, i would say at least two of them in case one disconnect. The other day, i joined a nuke to collect flux for a Biv daily just after codes got resets with the help of Reddit. I use a guy gamer tag without him been on my friend list.
---
Thank you!
---
So free dlc is corporate cash cow ü§î
---
The best story of any fallout yet is a cash cow? Not that you‚Äôd know seeing as you‚Äôve played it less than 30 minutes. 
---
This sounds delicious.
---
You don't even have to Nuke Helvetia to prevent the intestines from spawning... I've had a few times where the small animals didn't spawn and it took a long time to finally get enough.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The spawn of the small creatures sometimes like to bug out... Seems they are on a different spawn rate than what the parade is on.
---
The squirrels spawn (or lack there of) and the Sloth Beast glitch where it doesn't drop anything are the two most common glitches with the parade I've noticed.  
---
Crouching stealth boys being too far away 
---
But don‚Äôt you understand? They‚Äôre *just being raiders, not assholes.* / s
---
Ok, so now I've got the idea to make an ultra secure room, tripwires, booby traps, locks, and at the center some letters spelling out "You are the real treasure!"
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear it!
---
Yeah engine is in a desperate need of an update, question tho cant they just simply update it and improve the same engine? Not sure how that works?
---
I tell people, mostly the lows to throw grenades at it to ensure they get hits in. 
---
Kidding me? What a joke. Allow us to link accounts and launch from steam if we purchased on the crappy Bethesda launcher ffs. Stop shooting yourself in the foot!
---
Right? Okay, is it all new accounts that this is happening to? Maybe their systems are funky atm.
---
You'll get more don't worry
---
I can‚Äôt wait for player vending.
---
No problems on PC. Maybe your PC sux?
---
This happens to me too. Only solution i found is to group up on the main menu before joining a server.
---
That so kind of you!
---
So you're saying of I wait to buy my Bethesda games they'll eventually end up on steam?
---
We should all get steam keys, other companies have done it. And considering it should have been there in the first place instead of holding this game hostage on their damn launcher that no one wanted.
---
I usually vats it to be sure. 
---
That's exactly what I did....found the quantum paint on 1st try because everybody was doing the event.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh, I agree, Rad Sponge makes it plausible.
---
I'm saying if I *don't* have a team with Rad Sponge.  I haven't seen any real solutions for that, because Power Armor has some magical unseen buff against radiation that no amount of Lead Lined armor can come close to.
---
I have been seeing a lot of invisible jumpers. They r moving. Pretty sure folks have discovered a glitch.
---
Charleston, Monongah, and Watoga once was really good. 
---
Apples and oranges my guy. 
---
Xbox 1 and Playstation are entirely different consoles. 
---
This is an issue of PC players who were forced to buy directly from Bethesda if they wanted to play the game, after the impression was given that it would be exclusive to Bethesda Launcher. Now they are bringing it to Steam, which is the preferred distributor and game library management application for most PC gamers. Not even remotely similar to buying it for one console or PC and expecting to get it for free on a different console/PC.
---
Personally, I would have preferred Steam, but I wont be pissed about it unless something like Steam workshop integration is implemented, which I don't see happening.
---
Same here. First try.
---
Wait where is the plan?
---
Ammo should not be easily fungible. It would negate the entire mechanic of having limited ammo.
---
Problem is sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hit if you fire too fast or if it moves bhehind a tree. 
---
Been done to death and nothing spawns. Just kills the parade 
---
Sure, it doesn't have to be "free".
---
Quests are cool.
---
Willards waterpark yields alot of violet flux
---
What do you play on
---
Ps4
---
Perfect! I‚Äôll send you a link!
---
yes you can..
---
If you have a need for flux in its raw state General's Steakhouse is worth it for the garden plot out the back.  Especially if someone has nuked Whitesprings and you have the high radiation fluids and hardened masses already. 
---
It wouldn't be surprising if there was an issue.
---
Tnt dome 7...it's an unmarked quest. You can find some video walkthru on youtube.
---
I‚Äôm not saying people didn‚Äôt dupe. Most TSE probably are.  The one I bought I‚Äôm 99.999999% pretty positive was so cause the guy was trying to unload other stuff assuming he was losing them on one of the dupe fix patches
---
But something lije that is harder to throw out a blanket statement. 
---
I guess I lucked out... cause I've yet to see it happen on my server. I was just curious but didn't want to be a total A-hole and do it myself... 
---
 I did get to see once someone nuke Whitespring resort. Everyone on the server came to clear Whitespring and it was the first/only time I saw the server ignore that hours Parade. 
---
Elevator would bring me back for sure, I‚Äôd make some super crazy basement for armor/weapons like a bunker 
---
God Damn Party Hats.
---
trading in these games is odd...
---
It would seem so. He was visible and moving around but vats ignored him.
---
Full Heavy Robot armor w/ sentry bot helmet, just because its very difficult to find all decent pieces and its not the most effective but high on the list.
---
I was just going to post about this.
---
He was standing and running and I could easily see him. He was also close enough to use a shot fun on.
---
Literally Any place would be a welcome change. Except Morgantown. This seems to be a place that gets nuked but it sucks. I ran a nuke zone for its duration there recently and not a single legendary enemy spawned.
---
No VATS on crouching players AFAIK.
---
He was standing, running and shooting so those aren't the reasons.
---
He wasn't crouching. He was standing, running and shooting.
---
You being low on action points 
---
Do you still have that donut recipe?
---
Need to find a weightless one and get the chameleon mutation. 
---
Wth of english is this? Lol
---
 Cthulhu is not to be trifled with. Awake, asleep is one to him. The limits to his power, have not been found.
---
 Flutter on. ;)
---
Same but for the traveling Responder vendor bot. I've hear he's easily accessed at the lake across from the Charleston station but after 300 hours I haven't seen him once.
---
Build not gun
---
How much crimson do you need
---
Nope.  I maintain computer systems at enterprise level for a living, it's definitely not my system or the gigabit connection.
---
Nope. I had no problem using vats on everyone except the one guy. Noone in my group could use vats on him but we could on his teammates.
---
I don't think so. 
---
Yeah. I thought sentinel worked when crouched so when i found my chameleon+sentinel piece i traded my weightless+sentinel pieces for assassin+sentinel. But then I started to notice that I was dying quicker than normal and decided to ask this question. Oh well 
---
having the same issue
---
PMed my GT
---
Damn. Ok. Well, I apologize for jumping to conclusions!

I read through your posts in your removed thread. I saw a few reasons why it might've been removed but I won't speculate. Not being able to read the removed text in the original post also makes it difficult to pin down a reason.
---
PSA be nice to the mods they really are good people who volunteer to keep this place under control.
---
unfortunately i think the codes just expired like ten minutes ago. It wont take much time for Nukacrypt to get the new ones but i dont think it will happen in the next few minutes.
---
uh YES.
---
It would be nice if griefing camps without starting PvP makes the griefer wanted along with having free attack open on them at all times. Basically permanently wanted for 48 hours of play time, and lose a little bit of caps, aid items, and ammo every time they are killed by another player. Basically, they griefed a non hostile camp and the game made them an NPC-esque target, dropping loot on death.
---
Off topic what about arm tattoos oh and back on topic better looking mustachios!?
---
One time i waited a long time for someone to come out. But then that person has run away before i could drop anything.
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11823770
---
the previous day they mass murdered every person in the server üòÇ
---
When is going to be over?
---
They stack. With many pieces you can literally go and mario jump on enemies' heads without them noticing.
---
But as other mentioned, it's not the only good perk.your choice.
---
Did you try manual target in vats? 
---
Or did you just spam the vats button and get mad? 
---
Well I mean just about literally every node you can take the materials, bulk them and sell them for caps. I mean if anything adding the ammo factory to the list of things you can babysit, bulk and sell for caps leans towards improving the balance and not worsening it. 
---
I do this too, but I also lay out front naked all seductive like because this world is a confusing and terrifying place. 
---
IMO. They should add slap damage to camps. First hit gives you a warning on your Pip-Boy. Second one grants Retaliation from the camp owner. And breaking auto bounties a fair but good amount of caps. 
---
Breaking stuff in a camp should net you a % of what the object was made of. 
---
If you can get the vendor it's only like 170 caps....
---
Yea you have to be standing, as the description says. Other positions negates the effect. 
---
Damn institute someday you'll pay for this
---
If they change the rng and extend the event, I will be extremely happy for the community. But I will be a little sad for myself. I'm about to go on holidays like 2 days after the event finishes, so I'll probably miss out.
---
I really feel the lack of communication and confusion around this event, shows that when they say they are moving forward with communicating with the customer base, they really aren't.
---
Along the same lines as the Centaurs in other Fallout games.
---
It's ok.  Nothing amazing though.  You'll find a better melee weapon pretty quick.
---
Well i guess its only fair. Cant be invisible and indestructable. Time to start using stealthboys again
---
how would multiple pieces of chameleon let you jump on people undetected? it only works when you dont move. or you referring to sneak gear? 
---
i dont think so, because a friend of mine created an acc a few hours ago and his username is showing up normally.
---
but i have a feeling why it was happening to me, maybe its the same reason for you.
---
before i didnt have a bethesda acc. but i owned fallout 4 on steam. and i needed to enter an email in fallout 4 to access the creation club site. but it never asked me to actually create a real bethesda acc. and since today was the elder scroll 3 giveaway, i wanted to create one. so i typed in my email but bethesda told me it was already in use (creation club in fallout 4 used it) so i clicked "forgot password" and "forgot username". i entered my email and got an email to the registration website, where i could finally add a real username and a real password to my email.
---
idk why bethseda made it so conplicated and confusing. they should make fallout 4 creation club ask the useres immediatly to create a full acc and not only ask for an email adress.
---
well basically i think because i "half created" an acc with my email already in the creation club, the "complete creation" of my acc with the same email probably mixed up stuff. idk.
---
so since you bought fallout 76, maybe its login-related or something similar. because at least me, i needed to enter my email in the creation club tab in fall out 4 back then. maybe it has something to do with creating/logging in into the game
---
Oh ok also is it rare or nah
---
Yeah,  he gave everyone a Jester and Skull mask.
---
I'd like a shaved head finally. 
---
It's giving me a headache... lol
---
Just 1!
---
You raise a good point, I guess it wouldn't be that big of a deal after all!
---
I agree. Either let us break down ammo or bulk wrap ammo for sale.
---
likely closer to 1/200 for uncommon and worse for rares
---
Funny. Do you write for jay leno?
---
Here is more info. Translated the tweet from Japanese with google. 
---
"Before the end of the fastener pigeon event, the masks of Gorogoro and liquor miners dropped. I was able to pick it up though it was supposed to be a charge item (I'm not scared to pick it up ... but all items will fall into a paper bag, but it's a drop. "
---
Nice
---
To fight against newer players who don‚Äôt realize the caveat of the armor it is still way effective. 
---
Yeah sure dude, I haven't been on the game in ages so will have to download patches etc... But sure.
---
The best part about doughnuts is that they are one of the very few craftable food items which don't spoil, even though they require lots of components. 26% food with 75% bonus perk and they weigh very little with thru hiker.
---
sweet man, my psn is mr_sniper0300. just send me a msg whenever your on and we‚Äôll make a deal. much appreciated your doing this
---
And longer beard &gt;:(
---
Sorry ! I don't English well, But show this to all.
---
Monorail elevator, top floor. Plenty of weights, I usually get around 100-120 units of lead a run
---
Yes, far better state then it was. 
---
I‚Äôve never played a fallout game where I didn‚Äôt want to carry mini nukes/missiles. It‚Äôs just weird. 
---
I'm on Xbox, but it's more stable, there was a community event that came and went, stash space is 800, and a lot of nerfs. 
---
Will the Quest still exist in the future? I don‚Äôt have as much time to play as I would like. 
---
Sorry it took me a bit. It‚Äôs a 2* mutants hardened piercing combat shotgun
---
Vats critical shots do +50 damage is the 2nd star
---
I have gotten plans twice an no mask
---
Nice work. 
---
It's a loop between the Enclave bunker(or your choice of technical data supply) and Camp Venture. To be fair, it only drops 1* armor, but in my experience it only gives heavy combat armor, so if that's what you want, it is a good source. 
---
I have the same issue, with exactly the same circumstances: I have used the Creation Club in both Fallout 4 and Skyrim, and registered the email for use, essentially creating "half of an account" as kanink007 says. No other information is required beyond registering the email for the Creation Club services. After completing the entire account creation process I have the same issue with my account name showing up as a string of randomized letters and numbers (which is probably what the server assigned to my Creation Club usage originally. 
---
Alot of the time when some destroys a whole camp its because currently it gives the highest bounty. They like pvp and this way the pvp comes to them. That or you built at Charleston train station and the camp blocks the event vendor from spawning and they are doing a community service by destroying it.
---
I got a swing speed, strength, and instigating weapon once. The kicker... It was a pool cue. 
---
I find it weird that I can get my character smashed and nothing changes. If I drink 3 bottles of something I'd like to see my character being unable to walk straight--don't need any new animations for that.
---
How?
---
Is this only for animals you can tame or any random encounters?
---
It's a little late, but if the sloth glitches after death, fast travel close, return, find the decomposing meat pile, and loot. Works every time. Assuming you shot it at least once, of course.
---
If anyone knows a nice flat area high up near cranberry bog (to make for a good view of nukes) i'd be gracious if you could tell me.
---
im sorry but your shot gun doesnt even have 2 of the perks that i was looking for
---
Also gay
---
I'm sorry for your loss... At least I'm finding consolation knowing this has happened to someone else before haha. When I tell you I am HURT right now!
---
I've seen this and I've also see a Sheepsquatch horde event which I excitedly went to and it was just scorched.
---
A place where the lemonade vendor can spawn (among others things) is it considered a random encounter? Because there's on such place close to the overseer camp, to the south near the rusty truck...
---
I do kind of the same. I'll give level 5's to level 20's some modded out weapons I made myself.  Hardened recievers, stabilized barrels, something I'd give myself.  I also carry any ammo I find and ask if they need any.  Some kid was really appreciative of the 200 shotgun shells I dropped, which was nice.
---
Good to hear it!
---
It‚Äôs great for bar fights. 
---
Where does this spawn from? Is it an event reward? or just a super rare world spawn
---
apparently from the messenger event or guided meditation
---
yeah looks like this "bug" or whatever it is called is caused by the same roots: something "half acc", "steam" and "creation club" related. because as i said: a frined of mine also created an acc today. and i know he never was related to bethesda, steam or whatever before. in short: his email was no where used bethesda-related. so he registered with a clean email and his usernam is shown totally normally, no digits and letters.
---
Wait,what?
---
I have 3 scarecrows and constant attacks, all enemies.
---
Burdseyeflu is the user. add me up if ya see me
---
I would be interested if you can make them
---
Still much better than 1/3000!
---
Agree 1/10 seems still too common, 1/100 or 1/200 sounds decent for a limited time event.
---
It was hilarious though. It's like getting to the gates of heaven, the RNGsus is like nah bro, this is all you get. On that note, it was a good run because I got a a vampire, swing speed, reduced weapon as well. Oh yeah, that was a golf club. 
---
yep, seems kind of stupid to let all those cannonballs, 10 mm, crossbow bolts, cryo cells etc etc to waste
---
Why the fuck are you taking this so personally? Literally all I said was that people duped tokens and fuzzy costumes
---
This is why we can't have fun. muh skillz
---
I'm not sure how I am not being nice in this post.  Thanks for the info of messaging a mod.  I'm pretty new to posting on reddit and on other online formats that I have used, direct messaging a mod is typically frowned upon.
---
i did it just to be a dick.
---
I've been out of touch for a while from 76, are there NPC's in the game now?
---
ahh the system works.... sometimes hehehe
---
I see snallygasters and get excited, gotta get me some of that acid.
---
Could be from getting into the dev room. Need a video to believe it. 
---
Just encountered them. When I heard the flute playing I thought the British were a comin'...*again*. Broke out the black powder rifle and fixed bayonet. Then I saw the eyebot and its entourage of rats. I was waiting for the rats to jump me, but they were not hostile and just marched past. Pretty cool if not bizarre.
---
I have several of them including two-shot and bloodied, right now they just sit in my stash collecting dust. My two-shot missile launcher fires only one missile not two lol. Bethesda ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô the heavy explosive weapons next to useless at the moment. 
---
Yes, seen it on a few camps. 
---
I have 1 and its (known) so i imagine theyre fairly common. Im on ps4 if you wanna buy it 100 caps.
---
I do. The only way I‚Äôm effective is via crits. Taking as many crit damage increases as I could. I‚Äôm pretty ok in pvp 
---
mmm nice niiiiiiiice
---
Your console and tag I'll see if I can help you
---
IT is, As stated I have seen it in a few camps. 
---
Rare in that it's only available through questline. Rare as in worth mega caps? Not really.
---
This entire community complained about RNG when it came to legendary drops, but turning looting into an RNG-fest because you used a chem is OK? 
---
I can never bring myself to kill that man. or synth
---
Wood armor is cheap to repair and light.  Perfect for regular running/resource hunting.  Just a thought.
---
Not the sack outside the door?
---
Full set of weightless armor and Chameleon mutation?
---
LMFAO
---
It makes fasnacht day impossible as no animals spawn to get the intestines for the butcher.
---
Rank 3 good with salt doesn't reduce the spoil rate down to 45%. When it says 90% reduction it actually means food spoils at 10% the normal rate, so food will literally last ten times as long.
---
I'm on PC, sadly, but thank you so much for the offer! I suppose I have just been very unlucky with my workshop rewards then. ): 
---
The cat lady‚Äôs house northeast of Morgantown, and all the golf balls at the tees in Whitespring net me all the plastic I could ever need.
---
I've been playing for the past month and never had a crash or disconnect until this last patch.  Now I get disconnected once or twice a session.  Last night was particularly horrible.  Lag was terrible.  I'd hit and enemy and it would litrleraly take 3 seconds before it would register.  Got disconnected 4 or 5 times.  Once right as I was completing the fasnacht event.  Didnt get my reward.  Was probably a jester mask tooüòÄ

Noscope_420bird I got about 100
---
I could see him and he was shooting. 
---
sad.... but not untrue
---
Grahm sometimes has it.
---
I run the state penetentiary. The big thing there are the amount of can chimes. There are around 12 of the them (off the top ofy head) each gives 9 cans, and each can gives lead. That plus the gym equipment in the yard can be picked up now. 
---
They dont
---
Lmao that's me in the excavator power armor
---
I don't think they know, some of the original info released for '76 talked about CHA effecting it while in groups.. 
---
I'll have to keep an eye out for him then! Thank you!!
---
Trying to work it out as I go. So just some hints for now would be great.  
---
more and more people seeing the same thing
---
Psn noscope_420bird hit me up
---
When I hit the vats button it wouldn't lock on to do anything. Why would I get mad? It's a game? My partner with the shotgun took care of him and I focused on the others. I'm just curious how someone can completely avoid vats.
---
\*nod\*  
---
I have hundreds of common masks, it's about completing successfully, with no losses, and not getting a mask, which should not happen
---
I find their use to weight ratio to be off putting. also the timing is not good. usually way out of blast radius by the time they explode. 
---
Don't think he can be, atleast I've never seen him injured
---
Explore yes, lore not so much. Each place here is more like a landmark for reference. Its got about a 1/4 the lore as f4 did
---
If they are decent I'd be happy to drop 200 atoms or something on them. 
---
Gotta give them a reason/incentive to create more cosmetics. 
---
This game is arguably harder imo. It's a survival game imo. A bad one at that. Its Fallout though. You decide.
---
There are a lot more holotape recordings in this game if you like those 
---
The only two practical uses I've ever found for it is getting at someone who did have a PvP bounty that was in their base and taking out bases with asshole locations such as directly behind the golf club. Other than that it's only purpose is to either minor grief players by destroying them or minor trolling by getting wanted and hiding in someone else's base so other people get wanted flags trying to get you.
---
At the end of the day I think it was added primarily due to limitations in the engine. They wanted a feature where mobs would attack your CAMP and Workshops but they didn't want to risk bugging up the code by making player damage interact differently than non-player damage and if they did people would have just found bugs to grief bases anyway. If it was intended from the get go it's a poor design choice at best. If it was a limitation I hope they continue to improve the system, such as how they've made it so wanted flags don't trigger if you simply ding the siding of a house.
---
They have a line for a Legendary reward as part of the quest, think that is stand alone
---
Well the why people do it is a lot like when you see a nice sand castle on the beach, I imagine.  It's just in game theres no consequence to acting like a jerk.
---
For one save all your ammo two save all junk and 3 scrap any and all guns weaker than your strongest 
---
Thanks, but looking to buy in bulk 
---
If it is cheaters then we should expect some bans again soon, which is fine too. That also would mean we weren't meant to be getting the mask for the event though. So when on earth *are* we? That's why I wondered if it is for after the event or something.
---
BTW i did go find the picture of that guy I saw. We had a group \[picture together\]([https://imgur.com/a/wx9ufuj](https://imgur.com/a/wx9ufuj)). But photo mode doesn't show usernames, so there's proof it's not the same guy! I don't remember his username. He was American and using a mic but that's all I remember.
---
I moved my camp right after patch 7.  It's the first time I've had a scarecrow. I've only had 1 molerat attack my camp this whole time. And it skipped the scarecrow and went for my generator. This camp is only about a 45 second walk from my old spot that got attacked frequently, up to lvl 68 scorched. It doesn't prove anything, but until I find out different,  my garden will always have one.
---
I remember reading something about early concept art showing that Snallygasters were supposed to be like Human-Centipede-esque Centaurs, and that the skeletons/animations just couldn't make it look good
---
Were the events 100% successful (aka no dead robots)?
---
Any location where you encounter the robot seeking escort to a location event is a random encounter event.
---
but there are a lot of random encounter event locations
---
done 300+ times now. No uncommon or rare. Base on what i see, i never encountered anyone wearing those rare masks. I hope they do something to make up this problem.
---
eyyy! small world.
---
I dont really know because I have never got it myself.  I see it frequently sold to vendors by players though.  I personally use All Rise and an AA Super Sledge on my two characters as they're pretty great.  
---
Still would have to stand still.
---
I have one but I wont be on tell tomorrow I'll sell it for 1.5k
---
He had the handmade plan for a bit over 1600 caps the other night...sadly I was on a new low level character that didn't have the caps available to buy it.
---
I always love running into him in game, he's hilarious. 
---
Exploring is good and i fuckin live for lore and this game has given me a shit load it's one of the reasons i still play i want to document everything i can.
---
I never said you weren't it was a general etiquitte guideline/tip for contacting any mods. Don't be defensive.
---
This would be great 
---
If you mean human NPCs then unfortunately no. but there is 1 new robot called Biv.
---
It doesn't necessarily mean they've rejected it. They could still be loading the event/area. But I get what you mean.
---
Fair points.
---
I can‚Äôt get the vendor to spawn :/
---
Sounds like you might be speaking from personal experience here :D
---
Well everyone in irl West Virginia are crackheads. Highest rate of opioid addiction lmao. Inbreds are up there as well. I live 4 hours away from that abyss
---
Same. even though I have no remorse for any of the gen 3 synths, Danse is just too hard to kill.
---
Love going on mudurous rampages to give lower lvls a boost
---
I do, I'm so sorry I forgot to let you know when I got on. At work now, but should be on in around 2-3 hours. Had a few trades last night that I had to take care of and it was a weird night lol hit me up on the PM's on here, I see those much easier
---
Yes that‚Äôs a random encounter location and it‚Äôs on the map here. I‚Äôve seen it spawn Mr. Squeeze, crashed satellite, Reenactor, Vertibot, Dead Greaser, Kora‚Äôs duffel bag- a few others I‚Äôm sure 
---
I only play fo76 through steam, just link bethesda launcher .exe on steam and then on properties, launch options just add: bethesdanet://run/20
---
That will make launch fo76 with no problem and with steam UI!
---
Bethesda please take note of this.  
---

---
Interesting, i don‚Äôt have AAE but have bloodied non-E and TSE version of the 50 cal, they are pretty satisfying, most enemies can‚Äôt survive two to three bullets. 
---
I'd say if it excels at anything, it's exploration.  Really, if your main attraction to Bethesda games is aimless wandering and exploration, 76 is almost *devoted* to that.
---
Cool. Are guns/armour random throughout the game or is there a good place to go
---
Sometimes if there are more then one targets it will prioritize one guy in vats over another idk why (I might suck) but I have to use my D pad and select the guy I wanna kill after vats locking on a different guy.  But being invisible is the only counter I know 
---
Thanks
---
Lol too bad no one will want to buy it regardless.
---
I come across him fairly regularly. Add me on PSN and if I get one I'll give it to you. 
---
PSN: SquatCh_D0G 
---
Yep, that's right, and that one's already on the map. Thanks!
---
Mods right now are relegated to texture swaps, sounds or song replacements, or other UI QoL enhancements. None of them are actual executables or dll replacements (aside from your shaders). So...your title is a teeny bit alarmist. 
---
Why not just craft 
---
This happends to me to sometimes. Only did 60 runs but my luck and char sits at around 19. And sometimes I just get a legendary instead that is super annoying because its a one star i‚Äôd rather have a mask. I thought this was about camp, food  recipes and masks. I know im lucky that I get legendary but I‚Äôd rather get on of the five undrippables.
---
Ok awesome do you use anti armor legendary 
---
Indeed, that's how I found several of these!
---
All random but some areas spawn different gear than others but also the lv of the area also affects it too
---
Bring it on raider scum.
---
AD VICTORIAM!
---
I've done it over a 100 myself, Aten_Ra has multi-accounted it as far as I can tell each time.
---
They can update the same engine to keep up with current ones, current ones that are current because they aged well, got constant updates over the year, CryEngine, RAGE, hell, even Bethesda actually have a kick ass Engine, id Tech, used for Rage, Doom, Quake, Rage 2 I imagine... Anyways, the Creation Engine really needs an overhaul, specially now that they added Multiplayer into it. id Tech is old AF, it actually started with the first doom and they kinda combined it with some other stuff and it became I'd Tech as we know it today. 
---
Bodies are not lootable.
---
Here's the deal, Bethesda has put random non-identified questlines (like the Nuka cola Paints, alien blaster) in the game, people didn't even know where to look and figured it out in a couple days.
---
You had for a good part of a few days, everyone on the server doing this fasnacht event, people grinding for hours on end. If Bethesda had created some sort of system, it would've been found, there would be information scattered around Helvetia (instead of 1 Holo and 1 note, that say nothing important).
---
We'd like to think Bethesda meant well and we all just weren't smart enough to figure out their system. But the truth is, they screwed us all. There clearly wasn't enough testing of the numbers, or a decimal mistake (which happened before; Bobby pin weight). And they turned their backs too proud to admit they may have made a mistake and change it. Instead they choose their pride over their customers happiness
---
I am, but I spent almost all of mine on the Queen 
---
So people want new characters to be used in survival because they don't want to get one shot. While others want to use their main characters in the new survival because they basically want to one shot people? Am I getting this right? 
---
Nope, I think the suitcase is the best place for every. Personally Bethesda should make a community drop off every an access at vault 76. But, that's just me. :)
---
To conserve ammo early in the game use knives. To use knives early in game get good armor. To get xp, go into areas which present some challenges. But as a rule don't go any further south than Charleston. Not much further  east than Morgantown, and not too far north. If there is plenty of green spaces you're generally in a good spot for newbies. Check the containers at overseers camp. Some of the higher level players drop supplies there to help new vault leavers
---
To complete the overseer quest make sure you have all of her tapes including tapes from silos Alpha Charlie and Bravo. Then go and nuke someplace that isn‚Äôt a fissure site.  You should find a tape at the silo you launched from saying she is disappointed in you.
---
Lore, exploration, surviving and scavenging is what keeps me glued to this game. Exploration is by far, its biggest strength 
---
All of them.  It's true that many of them don't seem to have a chance to spawn tameable animals.  Maybe in the future I'll have notes for the ones that do.
---
Congrats on getting through it solo. Sorry about the end though. 
---
I solo'd my first nuke blind as well. The hardest part was finding the key card in the first room.
---
Interesting.  I‚Äôve gotten random one star legendary drops the last two times I‚Äôve completed the event.  Is this normal?  It hadn‚Äôt happened for me prior to today.  I thought maybe it was a delayed pop for the legendary sloth, but the drop was definitely different.
---
I'll give it a crack too hopefully this chapter turns out better
---
There is nothing to imply any orientation. Nick only has one love; bringing the dirtbags of The Commonwealth to Justice.
---
Brutal. I always store my decon shower for that reason. I have a spot that I leave open to drop and connect it. 
---
Maybe next year
---
It seems to be a blocked area.  Can‚Äôt move the camp nearby to reach it.
---
Dam my eyes have been opened, had no idea.
---
Not to pull you away from what yoir doing man but I sure wish I could pik your brain a bit more about it if I could
---
I think there is one that will be added to the atom shop
---
I just found an anti-armor fatman from a fat ghoul, should be fun to try it on different armor types when I get a chance. 
---
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH that's just crazy talk, lol
---
If you're a male charecter you can make him fall in love with you therefore he's gay. I'm pretty sure all charecters can fall in love with either sex though so they're all gay, in a way. 
---
I get that it‚Äôs fun to be a jerk. But why is it a feature of the game? 
---
I was once loom8ng for the plan and decoded to try the Federal Disposal site. Got it my first try. Try there.
---
Thanks, I'll be sure to add it
---
Will do! Not sure how long I'll be on tonight but I'll PM you if I'm still on in a couple hours. I'll be on tomorrow too. Thanks!
---
He was by himself. Vats didn't lock on anything. 
---
Thanks, I'll check it out when I get a chance
---
Oh, and some wood and cement will build your first shack, then it's more and more materials until you have your 3 story Appalachian condo 
---
Some people suck 
---
Will check it out, thanks!
---
K sent request name same as reddit.
---
Well that sucks 
---
I mean, yeah it sucks that some of the masks are super rare for no real reason other than to be rare, but I think "screwed over" is too strong of wording.
---
I'll look into it, thanks
---
You sound like a psychopath!
---
Have you tried moving the our camp elsewhere? You may be sitting directly next to a major enemy spawn location. Try moving it to a spot that doesnt seem to have any enemy spawns when you go near it.
---
Literally have nothing to do except toss my 6000 .38 rounds every few weeks
---
We‚Äôd love to have you on board, I‚Äôll send you a link üëç
---
Calmex = potat crisps, nuka grape and seasoned rabbit skewers...maaaaaaan
---
I‚Äôm down! Hit me up on PSN at radiationdaddy
---
*giggles violently in the underbrush*
---
I have not heard of that at all. Do the enemies spawn closest to the scarecrow? Enemies tend to aggro on the nearest camp item.
---
There are also two spots just south of Summersville - one is by the route 87 marker on the map, the other is slightly WSW of that in the dry lake bed
---
Character transfer isn‚Äôt supposed to be a thing tho.
---
I only got one character and don‚Äôt plan to use more
---
Once you get that high up in the game you write her become an omnipotent super villain, or a generous hero that turns into a super villain when you get bored
---
So, with no junk on me, i'm safe.
---
I need Charlie nuke code ASAP 
---
There's 2 Royal Jelly. One is in the aid section and can be used in a recipe the other is a junk item that can be broken down. The junk one drops from Honey Beasts, not sure where the aid one come from.
---
I always think the people who make comments like that just don't want new players getting caps. I dunno why i think that but its how it always seems to me. 
---
Where do you get those floors? They look great!
---
If the mutants and scorched always spawn in the same general area, you may be near a spawn point for them. You can move your camp somewhat in the opposite direction and they may leave it alone if it's far enough away. Mutants have a real long range to them though.
---
I'll save your post for if I get them tomorrow since it seems I can't get more then two plans a day. I also seen many people say that the sentinel paint does not exist in game.
---
Coffee is life, it is how we flow through the universe. 
---
I was wondering about your post, just Incase you don‚Äôt know, you can‚Äôt combine mutants, two shot or vampire. Those all take the same spot. I have an actual two shot explosive combat shot but not sure if I wanted to sell that one. 
---
I haven‚Äôt been checking the suitcase :(
---
Somewhere, someone us going 'Wiw! Yeah! I want that!' Just not me.
---
I want elder maxons  jacket pls
---
Also interested in gas nachos. ;)
---
Perk cards change the value on your character, does not apply to the stash.
---
Do you possibly have a junk card on?
---
I took off things like that just to test. 
---
Cool
---
No
---
Women desperately need longer hair styles. I know they just don‚Äôt want to have to animate it but come on.
---
I'm Dr. And he is Doctor but no one seems to notice that difference 
---
I got the key but when I arrived at the dome it was already open so no key was needed. The paint plan was just laying on the table in plain sight. It felt like free giveaway yet nobody wanted it lol 
---
Can you please add Power Armor displays?
---
When I killed Kellogg, I immediately started wearing his outfit.  I love the way it looks and the protection it gives.  It also serves as a warning to those who might stand in my way of finding my son.  
---
How about any affects?
---
Any legendary equipment that decrease junk weight? 
---
Yeah I'm not a PvPer by any means and it bugs me when people attack my home.  But I guess the devs wanted people to be able to, in order to encourage more PvP.  I am willing to bet they did not expect so many people to be against it.
---
Oh ok. I thought it was all some kind of joke. No problem.
---
Sorry üòâ
---
It looks like the back of an imperial star destroyer. 
---
Gas nacho plans??? Do you mean old man winter 
---
No idea. But apparently it stacks your general stealth ability. It was a video posted on this reddit.
---
This.
---
Thanks your understand
---
I have noticed that too.  Sometimes it triggers sometimes it doesn't.  However do be warned that if you have a lot of documents on your person, it will all be turned in all at once.  
---
If you're picking it up from your stash I've found that you have to server hope after each one.
---
I've had several 2-3 star enemies drop no legendary items over the past few days.  Maybe 10% of the legendaries I've killed.  I just get standard loot.  It's disappointing.
---
take up the same spot explain 
---
I get where you are at camp and a pack of dogs jumps in and starts chewing on things. Fending them off to save your camp is fun. But I was on the other side of the map, armor deep in a multistep timed event, and for the first time I got a message, like text on the right side of the screen, that said ‚ÄúYour base is under attack‚Äù. 
---
I thought it was some random creatures chewing on stuff so I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrush home‚Äù. After the event I got back and everything was gone, wiped, except for my foundation.  
---
I assume it was a pack of high level griefers. So what do I do? Rush back, get killed and get my camp destroyed? Or wait and spend valuable resources to completely repair everything? Seems like a no win situation, as well as no fun. Not sure what the answer is but as a gameplay mechanic it seems pointless. 
---
Accepted. I just had to jump off for a bit but I'll be back on soon.
---
Have many do you have I don‚Äôt want to take OP‚Äôs one but if you have extra I‚Äôll take one
---
I wonder if it was a combination of your perception being low and his agility being high. That he was too 'stealthy' for your low perception or something. Just a thought.
---
Alright thanks!
---
So if sun is the only one confirmed I gotta try to find him first and do his tasks. Have him first in the march so he takes the least damage. And maybe the small downtime today did something. 
---
This is just me hoping for something. Did 60 events and have friends with double and tripple numbers no rare mask. 
---
I do kind of hope you(or someone) do a poll tomorrow at the end so we see if more than 1 dropped. 
---
I know. 
---
How did you do that? When I tried to drop my Nuka Cola painted t51b it told me the item will be destroyed. I had to restore the default paint before I could drop it (PS4). 
---
Yeah I've heard that. Tried doing a quick search and found some good tips, but nothing about actually activating it.
---
After lurking on this subreddit for months after refunding the game I might actually rebuy the game because of this.
---
Nuke it after that part or just have intestines in your inv takes a lil work around but still possible 
---
Just tested. No perks steel it 0.05 not 0.01.
---
Because almost everything in this game is a copy n paste from fallout 4. So fallout 4 didn't have it, then fo76 wont.  That requires them to make new system objects lol
---
Can it be triggered just by grabbing it from your stash? I feel like I've tried this and it didn't work. I'll try again though
---
Most the ppl that crap on this game never even played..they just hatin
---
You missed yesterday. I dropped off 3k Shogun shells and a whole bunch of plans. That includes a couple from the heviate event.(Sorry spelling.)
---
This probably is the news prior to it being announced as a F2P game on Steam :)
---
I have a spare for 2k caps but won't be on  now till around 9am gmt
---
Bummer ))) I‚Äôll be checking from now on! 
---
What event is that? 
---
It does for me tbh
---
I think I was around that level.
---
But by now, people should know to take down a couple (or screenshot) people in the same game.  But also by now, Bethesda should have made it possible to rejoin the same game.
---
Yes at least SOME kind of penalties. 
---
I remember the keynote where Bethesda was talking about having griefing all figured out. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they did. 
---
I will pay 25k for the gas nacho plans.
---
Pretty big messup to go from .05%, to .005%
---
Once I got a [bomber jacket](https://i.imgur.com/mzcjhCB.jpg).  it was pretty sweet.  Haven't gotten anything else worthwhile since though.
---
I really want a spiral staircase. 
---
Probably just bugged for me then. A restart may fix. Still .05 doesnt add up either. Ever 10 i put in equaled 1 pound
---
There are mods that‚Äôs allow the function to loot cars for FO4 so the idea is there. And there features in game now that began as mods so no system would need to be made just extension as they have done now. 
---
I fo know because Ive been playing the series since pc Im not a lore master but the games were better and they can do better so this just an excuse to make money, if you owned a busines and had priorities like your costumers isnt that an insentive to do better every time? Look at what you playing comapared to any other game onbyour shelf dude dont pick an argument if all you want is the last word and want to sound clever then have at it im done with you. Little boy.
---
Probably. Idk, im just repeating what she told me happens.
---
Mutants, two shot and vampire can‚Äôt be combined on a gun. They can only occupy the 1st star of a gun. Explosive can be on a second star. So you might see a Two shot explosive shotgun, or a mutants explosive shot gun, but it‚Äôs impossible to get a gun that has two shot and mutants or two shot and vampires etc. hope that clears it up a bit. There is a chart that explains the possible combinations if I find it I‚Äôll send you a link
---
They did. They just didn‚Äôt think people would find ways to cheat the system. 
---
Look at workshops and how people can cheese the system. 
---
It's the one with the rare masks everyone wants. Lol
---
I am liking this idea! Some actual real penalties, that last over time. 
---
I will pay 26k for the gas nacho bonfire plans. Sounds hot. 
---
Yea I died from one today, was jumping and moving and could not lock onto him
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZk\_TFozwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZk_TFozwI) 
---
What'd I'd like to try though is having max agility and sneak and doing this with only one piece of chameleon armor and see if there's a difference. I'm working on respecing to this and I only have one piece of chameleon so far. I need to move 3 more points to agility and I'll be set.
---
Oh, Fasnacht in Helvetia? Yeah that one is cool!  I have only found time to do it three times, got two masks. I‚Äôd love to get that beret tho )
---
 Yeah about 60% of the time the door was open. I did open it the last time when I got the plan. 
---
 Its maybe a joke about the Security Door letter. ;)
---
I was just scrolling through all the mods of a laser rifle earlier today to see what changes they made to them, and noticed no increase to damage like you mention.
---
I‚Äôve found some at a train station! Thank you stranger!
---
Here‚Äôs with perks - https://imgur.com/a/EzpJHdq
---
My perception is 21. So don‚Äôt think thats the issue.
---
This robot has been following me around NE of Watoga for -no exaggeration- more than 20 minutes. He‚Äôa just repeating ‚ÄúHalt‚Äù... ‚ÄúPlease hold‚Äù ... ‚ÄúWait one moment‚Äù etc. 
---
No note in my pip-boy as of yet, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be giving up!
---
I've gotten quite a few drops as part of the quest completion - level appropriate, but 1 star.  Not including the low-level sloth drops.  No idea if anything triggered the drops, none of the runs I've done were terribly different than the others, mostly all of them with 5 bots alive, not sure now many were with no damage (small percentage I'm sure).
---
No, just a text/visual bug
---
Thank you!! Ill add you :)
---
Could be but I'd hate to see his agility. My perception is 15 before perks. Lol
---
Mine says that but i dint run pack rat much anymore bc of specific build 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
I had put the mod, better perks on my game. After one of the updates for FO76 I would log on and fall through the map. (Didn't update better perks mod) Every time I fell, that was the place for my characters dead body. I was also able to walk into walls, rocks, vehicles etc... I could fast travel to locations but was only able to walk on the same plane as I arrived on. Any change in elevation would cause me to slip through the map. It was almost like I had noclip to a point. Just thought about using it on the place where the legendary vendor is supposed to be!!!
---
I‚Äôll check again when I get home. 
---
It‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs just super light weight if I‚Äôm remembering my correct sword. Like 0.24 lbs. 
---
What time will you be on at? 
---
Spiral staircases is a must! Lol
---
Need dreadlocks and/or an afro, as black hairstyles are pretty limited. This is coming from a white guy, one of my characters is black and he just don't look nearly as cool with straightened hair. 
---
Not talking shit love the story but you do know that if someone has a bounty and in a team you can just kill the bounty guys. They can‚Äôt seek revenge and they‚Äôre team doesn‚Äôt become hostile. It‚Äôs literally free caps. I love people doing the bounty bait cause it doesn‚Äôt fool me. Can‚Äôt attack me but I can attack them it‚Äôs the greatest. After I take their bounties I switch servers cause those are the types of people to follow you to your base and destroy it 
---
I had this happen yesterday, killed a 3star  Protectron and got a syringer...I just wanted to jump off the building I was on.
---
Wtf?
---
How did you lose the junk?
---
The mod deleted them or you died/crashed to bugs or something?
---
I have better inventory to give me weights of each tab to help reduce my hoarding.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit. Anyone with a brain will clear their caps junks and aids before going into pvp. All to gain nothing to lose thanks to Bethesda. 
---
there's a few variations of those already 
---
I thought vendors respawn automatically daily. A camp too close can block a respawn? Is this a bug or a feature? 
---
please do cause ive been doing some google searching
---
Me too, but the lag is unreal right now.
---
Cringe name of LokiiSenpai.. i cannot wait for the name change on playstation to be a thing.. 
---
Or nothing at all. And this has said to have been "fixed" by them in patch notes ( albeit the shitty half assed notes we get) MULTIPLE times.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cheating. It seems anyone can go to anyone‚Äôs camp and destroy it. It‚Äôs a game feature. 
---
I wonder how much power an elevator would cost ü§î 
---
I second this spot. Have seen crashed vertibird and many others.
---
Last I played, we couldn‚Äôt finish because no animals spawned to collect intestines from. Not sure if that‚Äôs because someone nuked the even location but was pretty fun with all the glowing honey beasts and toads.
---

---
paying for levels would be pay to win.
---
I was referring to how you can start the contesting and teammates can do the killing. Should have been a 1v1 from the start. Team or no team. 
---
Am I an asshole if I‚Äôm laughing right now ?
---
Red rocket next to valley galleria is another.
---
I‚Äôm almost done at work I‚Äôll probably be on I an hour, hour and a half
---
Wrong! Unless you‚Äôre using mods it is not possible to romance Nick.
---
No kidding? So bonus power attack damage applies to running attack? That kicks ass.
---
Does that mean we'll be able to use money added to our accounts from steam cards to buy atoms?
---
Maybe when the PVP server comes online they will fix it. I am a PVE player and the griefing just seems completely off, letting players destroy camps just for fun and really for no gameplay reason. 
---
Come get your lemonade
---
It‚Äôs rounding up, just tested it with 20 scrap no perks. Stays at 1lb.
---
Once you attack a person with a bounty on a team you become aggressive towards the other group members. I've done the same bait with my group plenty of times. I'm pretty sure this is the case, but I've been wrong once or twice before.
---
I really really just want a version with crossplay. I bought it on Xbox on release cause none of my friends were getting it. Now with new updates and hearing about how much fun I am having building my CAMP they want to play but they don't have Xbox. I would even consider buying it on PC to play with them if I could transfer my character. 
---
Probably have to allocate perk points to all pools of special to cover the needed. Say for shotguns and rifles you need lower other specials and forgo them 
---
I much prefer that paid content stays cosmetic only. Dislike the idea of there suddenly being many more lvl 300+ because they have lots of money to dump into levels. 
---
Mad max

15% damage reduction while sprinting seems really good. Shame most people rocking full sets of this stuff likely got them during the dupe storm. I would be super surprised if someone put together a full set from solo farming.
---
Melee with cavaliers would be a terrifying surprise. After the first death, you can likely just marsupial to get away, climb something, and just wait for the sprint to end.
---
Totally agree and fuck the whiners. The people complaining wanted a game other than fallout, that simple. Call of duty rejects and fortnight losers plague this game and have almost had me just sell the disk. The nerf was stupid. The big complaint was people not getting to loot as much as they wanted in blast zones cause players were one timing the enemies so they didn't get to share. Funny how that is still happening after the nerf yet none of those same idiots are complaining now ! The idiots farming this game have almost ruined it. This game had so much potential and all that went up in smoke cause the none fallout players heaped their dead asses onto the servers, farmed, best all the major quests in a week cause they didn't follow the way the game was actually meant to be played then whined to bethesda that it was too easy, they were not able to farm enough, and pvp was not what they wanted. IF YOU WANTED TO BE AN ONLINE TOUGH GUY FALLOUT WAS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! 
---
+karma just got my lemonade recipes! Thanks!
---
Go for it. I might not answer it right way, but I'll try my best ;) 
---
Good idea. I play solo, so basically have to sit and watch things burn to the ground if a group wants to be jerks. Not great game design. 
---
It‚Äôs bugged right now 
---
Could you refund?
---
They‚Äôre still unsolved unfortunately
---
On console?
---
No one was doing that either
---
Stay strong.
---
Sooooo heavy
---
Replying to report my findings:
---
Logged in, happened to have a technical data on me, and the quest was already in my quest list. Turned in the quest, dropped my data's and picked them back up to see if they would restart the quest, but it didn't.
---
Server hopped, quest wasn't immediately back like the first time, but I dropped the data again and when I picked it back up it triggered the quest.
---
HOWEVER. I had 12 left and when I picked it up it turned my stack into only 1 item.
---
I saw this in another thread but already forgot about it. So, apparently what you have to do is drop them, then just pick up ONE to trigger the quest and then it into a quest item, then pick up your remaining ones. (Assuming you want to just server hop at Fort Venture repeatedly. I would guess a safer way would be to return to a stash, grab one, turn it in, server hop, grab another from your stash, etc.)
---
There there. There there.
---
Not for me that‚Äôs weird.. I bounty hunt a lot never baited people with it but I search for them caps lol
---
The Flatwoods Monster is totally misunderstood.  I can pass along the message that you're looking for him.  We were hanging out the other night.  He was drunk on Nukashine and allowed me to snap a quick picture.

This one time I did a Whitesprings run, I got 4 Legendary Mr Handy Buzz blades, all with different effects.

Literally just google it

Has nuke codes each week but since it just reset they dont have them yet
---
Next update pacifist mode will protect your camp, you, and not allow you to hurt other players except in PvP events.
---
Does jetpack exist?
---
That is an RPG phenomena I refer to as "Situational Sexuality," in which multiple if not all the player's companions can be romanced by either a male or female protagonist. This is done, for the most part, to keep the LGBT part of the game's audience happy and is hardly ever an indication of the companion's canon sexuality. As a Dragon Age player, I am all too familiar with the Situational Sexuality phenomena and the struggles therein to keep the bonds between my protag and his male companions strictly platonic.
---
yeah. and a guaranteed mask. /s
---
Strange to round when they have such specific values
---
Paladin Danse can be romanced if you‚Äôre male. The Far Harbor DLC suggests that someone may have loved him of the male variety. But Nick has no such recollection or feelings on that matter beyond friendship.
---
Yes next time when adding new content lets aim for them being actually obtainable. With the drop rate now it would take nine thousand plays to get a guaranteen "ultra rare" mask to drop.
---
Lasers and plasma guns still need some work. A shame because the lack of mods that boost damage actually means we have a lot of choice in how to set one up. I‚Äôd prefer if they upped the base damage some more. Plasmas need a bigger bump cause their split damage subjects them to losing damage to damage resistance twice.
---
The only reason I die anymore is fall damage bullshit, The monongah power plant event I had died from like jump height. Fell in between the power turbines from the floor right above the bottom one and died from touching the water. About jump height.
---
They give you an option to create multiple characters for a reason...
---
Or bulk it to sell at merchants even. 
---
got it, thanks!
---
The had us in the first half, I ain‚Äôt gonna lie 
---
I think it just switched to march 26-april whatever
---
Been there recently been crafting low lvl heavy leather sets dropping them in front of ppl at the overseers camp I give a wave as I set them on there ways to flat woods
---
Figures since it only displays whole numbers.
---
Why not its probably going to cost about $4 anyway.
---
I'll check it out! Thanks for the tip!! 
---
definitely a work in progress ;)
---
You get it in fort defiance, on the floor in one of the rooms. 
---
Yet if they buy it now - no refund if they don‚Äôt like it.  I know many gamers that won‚Äôt give it a try because they can‚Äôt get a refund if it sucks.  Hell, I only played it because a friend gifted it to me.  And it didn‚Äôt get good until I grinded past level 20.  This is a good move on Bethesda‚Äôs part.
---
I believe so but I've slept since then.
---
How do I find the robots?
---
I had a problem with my bags disappearing so I started using the stash box just north of the in the red rocket station. Cost two caps to fast travel there. I only get one at a time because of what happened to you.
---
Yes I run a shotgun / melee / rifle build, 15 points in strength for the shotguns and melee and 9 points in perception so you can max out the rifleman perks. Also recommend having enforcer maxed out along with tormentor for staggering. Maxed out bloody mess and at least 2 levels of adrenaline can also help.
---
I've been trying to master this myself and I've gotten close. Right now I'm a rifleman / sneak build but when it comes to all out chaos and SBQ I switch to a heavy Gunner build. I currently use a TSE lever action and TSE Gatling Gun. Heavy Gunner doesn't use anything in perception and rifleman doesn't need anything in Strength. I wanted to do a TSE Shotgun build but it isn't working for me with my rifleman with the perk cards for shotty being in perception strength and agility. . I'm curious to see what others use as a secondary tho. 
---
I did it read it... did you?
---
Send your friends 
---
If you're wearing chameleon armor, take it off. Crouch and br hidden. VATS crit should work. Cross fingers. Did mine in the Forest region. Would not work in Cranberry Bog. 
---
My point was they really didn't make an effort because this game was rushed and now I'm sure a much smaller team is left in the dust to handle the scraps.
---
Pretty sure it doesnt even need to be triggered, if you got technical data you can turn it in without the quest
---
8675309
---
Probably
---
Or they just wanted the whole 100% and not 70%
---
Theres Also another one near the damn. the one to your right as you fast travel there (the marker on your Map) and one to the left up on the ridge.
---
Which is why I try to make sure everyone is getting hits on enemies, especially the sloth. Unless I clearly see others are just along for the ride, I'm hitting something once, then moving on.
---
Oh I dont mind at all. I'm in the Forrest so they're all level 5 enemies. If its molerats or dogs I get food. If uts robots I get steel, and scorched or super mutants I get guns to scrap so it's actually a good thing for me. I just wanted to clarify that scarecrows dont deter spawns.
---
there‚Äôs a waste disposal site east of whitesprings marked on the map by a drawing of a truck flatbed with nuclear waste on it, that place has soooo many hazmat suits in it. some damaged some not
---
Not a problem! I think the lower leveled areas produce more common plans. I assume that there are tables of plans for each workshop that you may potentially obtain, and the rest is up to RNGsus. But I do know the FDS does eventually pay out table lamps. Good luck in your search ftiend!
---
Ahhh. Thanks. Was hoping while the servers were down, they maybe fixed the dropped rate. 
---
Can't find charley for March 26-whatever
---
69593915 not working.
---
Just switched till nextweek
---
In and out of Africa
---
I don't think it's a bug at all. Along with the sheepsquatch raiding peoples workshops it's a "hype" event around the mysterious and alluding sheepsquatch that will be discovered in upcoming DLC/patch (as per the roadmap)
---
I hit 120 very early on from the games release. Haven‚Äôt touched it in at least two months. Don‚Äôt think I ever will go back. None of the updates and QOL seem interesting. And it sucks because I had fun for the 100 hours I put in. 
---
Unfortunately not, I've tried just going to the little slot in the wall and there's no prompt to turn it in. :(
---
Me when I take a sip of Kool-Aid
---
Great pick
---
I can't blame you just failed the event a little bit ago a vertibot flew overhead at the supermutant part we blew it up it crashed into the Marchers they die event fails ten mins later a nuke was heading toward helvetia totally justified
---
Almost typed this in. Nice try
---
Oh that's unfortunate 
---
Dude this is crazy. Makes me excited for survival mode because this will happen ALL the time. 
---
Been wanting to try it, this sounds like a good time to get it, when they have steam sale. 
---
You'd probably have to split between shotgunner and heavy gunner in Strength 
---
I had to get my buddy to help my put it on a new character.
---
I mean absolutely shaved. No stumble, nothing, I am shaved in realityland and want my guy to also deal with his male pattern baldness with dignity. 
---
it does apparently, youtuber posted a video from initiate up to elder
---
All I want is crossplay with steam users, the last thing this game needs is to divide the community even further.
---
I think it‚Äôs good, except portable power isn‚Äôt worth it imo as power armor is weightless when on a chassis
---
Ya I said forget the shotgun build and trying to sell my TSE Shotgun now. My third weapon is melee so I just use that for my up close and personal encounters with enemies
---
Yeah, losing the bags is a pain. What I've been doing is just dropping like 1 round of ammo as a test, then once the bag appears in the ground I'll use the Transfer button to open it and add items that way. So far I've had no issue losing items that way.
---
Good call with the Red Rocket though, thanks.
---
Still here folks come get yourself some delicious lemonade.. leave reply for karma
---
I've done the event more than 100 times and have had this happen quite a bit. I had theorized that this was supposed to be a rare mask drop. Good to see others thinking the same thing.
---
Theres boat loads of lore if you're willing to read it through terminals and notes
---
I mean I‚Äôve killed hundreds of queens it‚Äôs 4 flux not 3 
---
u/ladydevann pls acknowledge this :(
---
If we do add a ‚Äúswitch character‚Äù option in the settings, I hope to see it do a GTA 5 transition, where it goes up to the sky, goes to where your other character last was, and transition to them.
---
I'm level 50 and have fought 6 different three star legendaries. I have not gotten a single three nor two star legendary weapon or armor at all. I've gotten lead pipes, pipe rifles and a fucking drill, as well as much wooden armor. Legendary farming is great!
---
What they really need to do is crate a Temporary team chat when you instigate trade with someone. 
---
I can jump off of everything in Watoga, no sweat for Gorge bridge. The only place I‚Äôve found so far that I can‚Äôt survive jumping from is the main monorail elevator. That is one lonnnnng drop.
---
How did you get all those Fasnacht beret?!!! I counted 5. i've been doing a lot of events and only getting one. I've been farming another one for my alt but I guess it's not dropping.
---
Can you send me a link please 
---
Pretty close to a nice sniper/heavy guns build.  
---
Oh man this sounds fun. I'd join but i just jumped off. We need more of this in FO76.
---
Regular vendors yes. There is a random event traveling robot, that can spawn outside of Charleston  station if people build there the rare vendor wont spawn.
---
If you would remove that perk for something else what would you recommend?
---
Oh yes, this. I know it's difficult to make People of Color hairstyles but it would make some folks pretty damn happy.
---
Reminds me of the Wanamingo from Fallout 2. Scares the shit out of me, almost as much as Cazadores do...
---
You still looking 
---
I would love to do something like a pistol side piece but they're so weak without perks 
---
Rocky horror picture show
---
I look forward to seeing you in The Wasteland!
---
Should have I'm using this as an option
---
I can't help but feel really conflicted by this post. The fact you left the cap area and were able to kill him when he didn't even try to contest is a joke. I wouldn't be surprised if that dude stopped playing over this and if he did I wouldn't blame.
---
&gt;Disconnected from server.
---
Ugh, this and the game crashing to desktop randomly are why I stopped playing. Was hoping they'd have fixed this by now. 
---
Guess it ain't happening. 
---
Bloody mess
---
Buuuuut.... it was pretty lucky for me right? XD
---
I like it; freakish and horrific abominations are fun to come across in the nuclear wasteland.

I'm near lakeside cabins..

Batteries included. At max rank, it really helps with the weight of fusion cores

I want to ride a bike. In full Power Armor.

Not kill the sloth...folks annoy me so much cause they run over to it and leave the robots. üôà
---
Apocalypse now?
---
Sure can! 
---
Ive seen uranium fever,feed the people and the messenger event there all overlapping each other at the same time. I thought of dropping a nuke on it just to see what happens. But there's "other" events i have my sights on at the moment. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs definitely worth it, this is a substantial thread head and shoulders above most posts about this.
---
You should have stayed in vault! 
---
Every time it comes for me it just follows me around and never fires.
---
Time to jump off a building ;)
---
Big agree. 
---
I leave all of my unwanted goods (legendaries, weapons, ammo, aid items, armor, etc.) in the cash register in the workshop area of the Whitespring resort, or if I'm overencumbered, in the ice cooler outside of the Whitespring golf resort. Otherwise, I'd leave my unwanted items inside the suitcases at the train stations like you. Maybe you'll come across my goods some day!
---
To loot a bugged sloth, have people melee it until it explodes
---
Same here
---
easily the Brotherhood of steel.
---
A good place to see a couple of fish more clearly is the river outside point pleasant that acts as the map boundary. There's usually a few swimming round there and the water is rather clear there too. There's also a Christmas tree near the broken bridge!
---
Jetpack? 
---
i don't think that adding more and more and more perks you have to have to make any descent damage is going to help the game to be fun.
---
This just happened to me now, on PC.
---
The golden mosaic tile floors? They were an LTO item in the atomic shop.
---
It's wah worse again on ps4, we've taken a step backward in stability. 
---
Haha, cool!
---
Lucky is one way of putting it, dickish is definitely another though. Maybe if he contested I would understand. 
---
Stopped bags disappear within 45 minutes of you stopping them, I think. At least, I dropped stuff in my camp in the middle of nowhere, don't think anyone grabbed it, but it was gone 45 min later. Made me a sad panda...
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the ultracite jetpack doesn‚Äôt exist in the game unfortunately.
---
Actually vaults varied dramatically in numbers. I don't know about 76, but not every vault held 1,000 people. Even those that started with 1,000 wouldn't have necessarily ended up with that number because vault tec fucked with people endlessly. There's dozens of reasons 76's population could have shrunk dramatically. 
---
No, it sounds like you exploited a bug to kill someone unfairly. That's pretty fucking low, it would have been different if they guy was in the workshop trying to defend it but the fact he was at his camp means he probably didn't want to PvP at all 
---
Invasion of the body snatchers. Original black and white.
---
Send me a link, would like to check it out.  
---
What system? 
---
You might want to swap out ricochet for bloody mess and tenderizer instead of field surgeon.
---
I get why you can‚Äôt sell ammo, all I would have to do it sell .38, .44, or 5mm (make 180 at a time with ammosmith) so with minimal effort I could make thousands of 5mm to sell, but what me and a buddy thought of was why not bulk the ammo like junk to sell? 100-200 5mm sells for 10? 
---
20-40 shotgun shells for 10 caps?
---
50 5.56 for 10 caps? Something like that maybe. 
---
Some of the harder to obtain ammo like mini nukes should definitely sell like they are. 
---
Also I think ammo should be way cheaper from vendors. 1 5.56 round shouldn‚Äôt cost 9ish caps, I would have to spend thousands of caps for it to even be worthwhile. 
---
Ps. I‚Äôm already always low on plastic so let‚Äôs not make plastic a requirement to bulk ammo if that ever becomes a thing lol
---
Batteries included says energy ammo? Does that mean it reduces weight on fusion cores as well that‚Äôs interesting. Thanks for the tip
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Wait... I'm a dick for killing someone and taking their junk? C'mon dude. It's part of the game. I wouldn't have done it if his camp wasnt right next to workshop.
---
Nope, it's a text glitch. Said event isnt set to happen until the first week of April
---
That would be incredible
---
I sure will! Thanks!
---
Getting tired of it. If you move your camp itll all come back but my camp won't go in its original spot every time. 
---
His camp was right next to workshop for one and for two it isn't an "exploit".
---
That's a great idea in cases like this event where it forces pacifist settings and light weight acts as if everyone is on a team. There is no competition. I think they did that part right, they just didn't consider the broader scope of the event settings. such as loot, and etc. IDK, maybe it was too hard to figure out loot drops for all the different player levels in the same area. Sadly I won't get to play again before the event has ended, but I had a really fun time. I play solo almost always, it was cool to interact with other players for a change. I feel like this was their vision for the game. 
---
Also discovered that they added a brewing station to the basement of Black Bear Lodge in Toxic Valley
---
Yes, but the whole thing is it's a mysterious monster nobody knows nothing about.
---
The "text glitch" is like a crappy photograph of bigfoot claiming it exists without any actual evidence. The glitch is a savvy way to slide the sheepsquach into peoples minds before it is actually proven to be a thing in the game.
---
I love wearing it along with the bomber jacket and the patrolman sunglasses
---
I don't get that mindset, your exited to be able to kill people and take all there shit, making them regret there time invested in gathering that junk. If you want to make people feel like shit, try ark, it's way more suited for that sort of gameplay
---
The 200 is shared between all accounts though... It would be the same as bumping the current to 1000...
---
I've been server hopping overseer's camp for what feels like hours and nothing lol. Oh well, it's a good way to kill time between Fasnacht events
---
I was like economy lol What the 200 measly caps in the vendor?? Or that one vendor that sell power armor plans for like 2600+ caps lolz Casually playing at lvl 45 now had maybe 2k caps that entire time max...
---
Levels don't make you win though.. I've killed people much higher level than me.
---
And at 2500atmos a level up 50, you're looking at 125,000 atoms costing someone around 1,337.25. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Then it would be cheapest, roughly 10$ a level 50+ so to get to 300+, you're looking at a minimum of 2500$ to hit level 300. $3,837.00 if you count in the first 50 levels. 
---
I just don't see many people spending thousands of dollars to be an item-less high level character.. 
---
lol what? 
---
Looks good with Field scribe outfit
---
Ad Victorum 
---
Yeah I needed more room in my stash the other day grabbed about 300 assorted grenades and mini nukes and just started throwing them up in the air and shooting them with a pistol. Homemade fireworks
---
?
---
Perhaps energy weapon armour piercing? Something at least.
---
I actually don‚Äôt lock anything in my camp. Unless I have a resources collector going, but my base hasn‚Äôt had one of them in months. Other then that come on by, use my workbenches or decontamination shower. Grab some purified water if you need it. I don‚Äôt understand why people lock these things.
---
Sorry Xbox updated post 
---
Where do you get the bomber jacket
---
I‚Äôve been running a .44 vat crit build and it is phenomenal. Stealth boys are your best friend, along with VATSing something with concentrated fire and putting the marker on the head of your enemy, so every VATS activation afterwards will target head immediately. I can not tell you how many people laugh at my revolver until I crit their head. By no means is it OP, but it is viable for pvp. Our only problem is when you‚Äôre facing someone also in a stealth boy, so I have an explosive gun to deal with that. 
---
ok. let's count beans.
---
first of all, the SBQ kill does not grant any flux whatsoever. the scourched earth event does, but only if the quest is triggered correctly, which is exactly the point of my /s post before, because the quest fails to trigger correctly very often.
---
I just feel like it would be heavily abused if we allowed some sort of shared stash, people will have multiple characters and use some as complete mules, which im sure bethesda doesnt want
---
Bullet Grenade = 1 adhesive, 100 rounds of ammo. Does 800-1000dmg. 
---
You have to Activate the Modus terminal right inside the door, pretty sure. 
---
Could anyone explain what a random encounter is? Is like a cryptid
---
Ah shucks.  I'm PC and have 3 extra lol
---
War Games, seems appropriate.
---
My psn is tigersmhs07
---
Me and my little group launch nukes semi frequently.
---
I'll be on all day tomorrow
---
You said you had to sprint over really quickly, so it wasn't just an accidental killing. Workshops are PvP areas yes, but if a player isn't in the zone they don't want to PvP. You ran out of the PvP zone to kill someone who had not consented to PvP, that's a massive bug. 
---
Possible drop by completing Forbidden Knowledge (depositing technical data in Camp Vennture). You must've finished Defiance Has Fallen for said quest to trigger.
---
but they do give you perk cards and let you swap out special stats that if you dont pay, you need to grind out.
---
Hard no there Squirrelly Dan.
---
The games servers are in the Amazon Cloud. Steam is just going to be selling it on their own launcher, and isn‚Äôt going to have its own separate servers. 
---
Tell him it's coming to Steam :)
---
People need to stop labeling everything as a "bug". Just because you dont think it should be that way doesn't mean its not working as intended or that there is something wrong with the code. I dont need "consent" to kill you right outside the workshop. 
---
Already did. No dialogue that‚Äôs relevant to the quest.
---
There is one that spawns on the highway as you are walking from the lighthouse to Morgantown. Iirc its before the junk node that is next to a bridge on the left side of the road. I usually walk from 76 to Bic and have encountered the Pied Piper and random enemy spawns in that spot.
---
Yea my ceilings are currently a wall and a half high and I just use a bunch of tables stacked up outside to get to the roof
---
That‚Äôs actually hilarious 
---
Thanks. Did know it even existed. 
---
I'm not sure why this is a reply to my comment but I'll give a tip I use. If you have so much stuff that a full repair from the CAMP device is out of the question, I'm pretty sure you can move your camp and everything goes into storage repaired. You can also store broken crops to fix them. It's a pain in the ass to have to do it but it is a working solution.
---
Let him play it.
---
Dont take it personally! Haters gonna hate ya know, smash that bots face in and revel in your enemies demise!!! 
---
B/W Night of the living dead
---
The Mire.
---
It was his safe space.  
---
You said in your post it wasn't right outside, you had to sprint to him before the cap completed. It wasn't like he built in front of the cap and you just happened to shoot him as he exited his door. What you did was a big and most definitely not what Bethesda intended. There is no point getting defensive now, your post made you sound like a griefer and your comments only enforce that. Players who kill indiscriminately are the main reason I and many others won't be touching survival.
---
yeah, so, my post was not that i don't think energy weapons shouldn't be buffed. energy weapons are incredible weak. but i think that the buff should not require additional perks. it should be a plain buff.
---
i am not a fallout expert but my understanding is that energy weapons use a different DR system, so a piercing buff would do nothing? not sure though.
---
Dickish is a perfect word for it. Gloating on reddit about it makes it more so.
---
So unnecessary!! I know there‚Äôs perks to lower the weight for ammo, but I‚Äôd rather use something more useful. I‚Äôm not always using heavy weapons. Like maybe if someone launches a nuke... maybe. 
---
I have 4700 5mm bullets. Like, wtf. Who even uses a weapon that uses those bullets? 
---
No Stop asking them to put stuff in the Atomic Shop. Just put it into the game as gear that you can find. Especially because if they do add it it will be way over priced for what its worth!
---
I'm wearing the army uniform from technical data hand ins and a pair of sunglasses with it
---
I feel your pain my friend. I launched my first nuke at level 30 and got disconnected when I went to the blast site. 
---
if you're on xbone I will sell you one cheap.
---
My gt is Sb vanguard
---
Fusion cores as well, yes it's REALLY handy if you carry more than a few cores.
---
Most of the wild cores you find in armor these days starts at 25% so your essentially carrying 4 for one full cores worth of power. Bloody mess isn't bad, but if you have a weight issue batteries included will help.
---
There‚Äôs some data mined atomic shop ones
---
Will do! 
---
Well to clarify, I meant that you will get that feeling of stealing something all the time in survival mode because of the increased punishment for being killed.
---
You're right, the guy told me he was using a cheat engine, and even offered to set me up with one. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and have an extra.  How much are you wanting to pay?  Do you by any chance have a spare donut recipe?
---
Heya (don't need help im at work!)
---
But post down your platform so people know if your able to help on PC/xbone/PS4!
---
You're right, because the guy told me he was using a cheat engine, and even offered to set me up with one.
---
Ive seen it on a vendor, I just cannot remember which. Have you looked in white springs? The vendor next to the armory room?
---
:/^)
---
It was close enough that he showed up on my radar as an enemy as soon as I activated the workshop. If this weren't how it worked then he could have just stood right outside the "PvP zone" and killed me. This is intended and call me a "griefer" all you like as engaging in PvP with or without consent isn't the same as trolling. I left his CAMP completely untouched and disnt continue pursuing him. And I'm glad you and yours wont be in survival, I dont want to get hate mail and get reported because someone is salty about how the PvP works in the game.
---
I have NOT had a random encounter by the Overseer‚Äôs camp in my last 5 or 6 visits. I fast travel to the camp and run down to the truck and into the clearing and NOTHING is there. Last week no problem, Lemonade guy, civil war guy, undetonated nuke, monsters galore. this week, nada. 
---
If you got what it takes, I‚Äôll dm you! 
---
lol
---
Hard no.
---
You‚Äôre asking to pay for convenience.  The atomic shop items are cosmetic.
---
Don't lie. You were looking to PVP. You would have looked for him on the map. 
---
Happened to me too, it gave me a suppressed rolling pin. The legendary drops are still a joke.
---
Won't be back on till 7am
---
Rosie...I‚Äôm on PS4 and in the same exact bind. Mind if I add you? No problem paying or trading. I just need one for the drink.
---
ParzAttacks on PS4
---
Hopefully they ban this guy. 
---
I just looked and it's a level 20 drill at that! Lmao
---
It wasn't, the guy disabled the need for the other person to hit him back. 
---
Yea I‚Äôm up to 4, my psn is LRS0907 add me.
---
Ohh god, if they added a way to make basements.... game of the year
---
Sex Addict David Duchovney's genitalia didn't take well to the radiation...
---
I couldn't have looked for him on the map. Once you are in PvP with someone you cant see them on the map... someone hasnt done their homework.
---
Read the correction. 
---
He wasn't in the workshop you definitely exploited because to kill someone who isn't in the workshop area while you're contesting is not an intended mechanic. You effectively took all of the hours this person soent collecting all of this junk and threw it away. Dick move. 
---
I live far from him. In fact we known each other over a year know and we met on Xbox.
---
Do you mean the fasnacht donut or did they add pancakes?
---
The drill and syringer shouldn't even drop as Legendaries. It's pretty ridiculous lol. 
---
It‚Äôs deifinity not a bug or glitch.  Currently, the Sheepsquatch are too quick for us, but sometime next week, there may be an event that gives them cause to let us see them.
---
Anger
---
I feel your pain, it has happened to me too
---
Lol he doesn‚Äôt even have a computer. Only Xbox.
---
Psn tigersmhs07 
---
Ok. Listen to what you are saying. To say that I "exploited" is to say that I broke the ToS which is absolutely not the case! If this isn't intended then why have they left it this way since day 1 and never said anything about it?
---
Who's up for blintzes?
---
You do not need to carry your stuff with you to repair on the road - it pulls from your stash. 
---
For you, maybe. 
---
There I go with my assumptions.
---
Consider me a new scribe! Ad Victoriam!
---
Wow, I wish I had known that. Shit!
---
Because it's a video game, meant to be fun. Where's the fun in grinding an event 50 times and not getting a single one? 
---
oh my god i need to do that now
---
My friend is only willing to buy things from trusted retailers like Walmart or whatever. He *maybe* buy it when it becomes $30. Anyone know any upcoming deals or anything?
---
Haha. PvP is "dickish". Got it.
---
Including power armor station? 
---
Ok i tell you when I got the code and when everyone is on 
---
Outstanding!
---
15 Luck
---
Do like I did with my cousin. She wanted to play other games but me and the other two people I play with only wanted to play 76. She eventually caved because no one wanted to play Red Dead online with her
---
A friend of mine found the tricentennial bundle for 10$ at a game shop. If free dlcs and a 10$ game doesn't convince your buddy, idk what will
---
Lol epic win!
---
Regular scissors have plastic. We can't have everything, I guess. 
---
Ok well there goes that idea.
---
Aside from the fact that you have to get 3 brahmin milk and frog eggs to make one donut that satisfies 15% hunger.  The lack of spoilage is cool, but deathclaw eggs also don't spoil, weigh less and only require 1 wood to turn into an omelette that provides the same food benefit.  Dog food doesn't spoil either and heals 30% of your hunger with a perk swap.
---
My brahmin usually runs away after I get 1-2 milk, so I have to server hop, hope the pre-hop milk doesn't spoil, hurry over to the pool in whitesprings, kill a bunch of harmless happy frogs, then run over to the Hotel before everything spoils.  I successfully did it once just to do it, then decided it was far, far easier to use the razorgrain to make plain soup that fixed both hunger and thirst.
---
The food and drink recipes seem to be designed by someone that has never played 76.  The Tick Blood Tequila and cocktail are laughably outrageous to make, requiring flux and corpse blossom juice.
---
How many players actually store spices, salt, pepper and sugar to create odd recipes when they can simply use dog food and purified water, Good Doggy and Dromedary perks much more efficiently?  I might eat a scorchbeast liver, scorchbeast steak and yao-guai steak before jumping into a whitesprings nuke, but I generally just survive on dog food and purified water.
---
I carry a Gatling gun around for AA against scorchbeasts. It's also pretty good for blasting a bunch of super mutants. Killed about 14 one night and didn't have to reload once.
---
I forgot about those.
---
what did his camp location have to do with your decision? I dont undrstand your thought process about why it would make a difference
---
Looking at you, mini nukes. 
---
Following up- still an issue. I opened a support ticket pointed at this thread. Got a generic "here's how to do the quest" response, followed with screenshot showing all the components 'lit' but item greyed out with you lack components message. They told me to put everything in stash. I explained quest items can't leave inventory so they elevated it to the "Advanced" team. Hopefully they'll address it in the patch tomorrow.
---
Highest level drill! Jackpot! 
---
The fact that his camp was so close to the worksho that I could see him as an enemy on my radar from the workshop so I killed him preemptively.
---
Thanks. If it's working on console I'm guessing it is a texture or shader issue on pc. Will keep trying
---
All the romanceable companions are at least bi. Deacon, X6, and Nick can't be romanced
---
I did this same thing last week. Sat in the silo for an hour hitting refresh on nukacrypt until it finally launched. 
---
I don‚Äôt launch them very often... lesson learned 
---
Ah, then the only suggestion would be to get them to watch some of the livestreams for Fallout76. You could stream it assuming your connection and data can handle it. There currently isn't a demo. 
---
I had my x-01 Jet Pack power armor chest get zapped into bits and bytes earlier today in this mornings server debacles.   Finally sucked it up and made a new one.  then got dropped from server again... BOTH GONE 
---
If you have the time what a couple hours. They're usually up around midnight =/
---
GT is harry wagstaff. I'm watching hockey ATM but should be on afterwards.
---
Want to buy some bullets? Xbox 
---
The book of Eli. Its got raiders in it. And the sweet old cannibal couple. 
---
I just went there to check after your message, and the greaser corpse was there.
---
You can find absolutely nothing in the same spot, several times in a row.  It happens.  Sometimes it's just bad RNG and nothing spawns, or sometimes whatever was there just wandered off.  Eyebots can fly pretty fast, for example.
---
I have my lever action up to 134 per shot. Pretty much destroys everyone from a distance
---
If you store your junk in your stash, you can still use it at any workstation on the map. The stash is a magical extradimensional thing.
---
You can complete every quest without PA. Nuke zones really need PA or hazmat, but they're not a quest requirement. If you abuse stealth then you won't need many stimpaks. PA's easy to acquire if you want it though. Just pick up some T-60 from various spawns if you're low on junk.
---
I had get a  sneak attack that I couldn‚Äôt register for some reason... same sort of bug. I removed all my armor, hopped servers, and then tried. It worked for me the first time I tried this. Good luck 
---
This camp is beat.
---
Where did you get that plan? I would love to have a SB hanging from my CAMP ceiling!
---
25 luck.  Dude‚Äôs smoking four leaf clovers.
---
Also the holotape series tales of the snallygaster sorta talks about them 
---
Lol y u replying to such an old post. Frick off 
---
&gt;going around claiming workshops in order to PvP
---
\^ Your own words. You claimed the workshop so you could attack him... not for the workshop itself. He didn't contest it, you ran in while he was doing something else and killed him. Enjoy your hoard on a secondary character. Lame.
---
Any of the vault paint jobs from the Atom Shop.
---
Nah, people who play survival mode won't be daft enough to carry their junk around. 
---
Beforehand, like any other workshop PVPer. Someone owns a lot of workshops. 
---
Yes. 
---
Its just a flying fish! Nothing to get excited about :D
---
Hopefully with the prestige system
---
Or what kind of exchange did you have in mind?  I‚Äôm looking to deal.
---
for an event that is literally only 1 week long, yea screwed over fits pretty well
---
underrated movie IMO
---
You can add me on PSN at radiationdaddy - I‚Äôm always happy to help!
---
Thanks for the help guys
---
In fairness, Bethesda seem to be actively encouraging it. In successive patches they've made workshop griefing easier rather than harder. Maybe trying to get PvP data before Survival launches.
---
I will enjoy it. Lol. 
---
I‚Äôd send a report to Bethesda to be safe. Definitely don‚Äôt wanna get banned for something you didn‚Äôt intentionally do. 
---
You don't have any remorse for the Gen 3s? They are pretty much the only conscious being out of the institute that is not to fault for the situation. They think they're the human the institute has told them they are. I don't get the synth hate. 
---
Dang. I'm on PC. Thanks, though!
---
If you're on PS4 and need help completing your excavator armor, add me, Jay_31_ and we'll get you sorted. 
---
Fuck yah 
---
VATS is pvp requirement 
---
Yeah ive got them all. It just isn‚Äôt completing. 
---
You boosted. Prepare for your ban. 
---
Nice C.A.M.P. 
---
You might want to wait until the new codes are up as they just reset
---
Very rarely. I don't really PVP much, but it feels cheap to me so I think I only ever VATSed somebody once, then I felt bad :(
---
Clean clown outfit. 
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, they won‚Äôt be touching it either. When everyone is playing the same way, they‚Äôll retreat to their exploits and either trying to bait people into PvP or going well beyond cap areas to attack people that would happily just give up the workshop. But don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre not dicks. Just ask them.
---
Is it possible to change your special later?
---
first thing I look at when trying to see why the F my character is so heavy is ammo...Today I had for some reason I had  350 .38 ammo on me. I left the donation of ammo at a suitcase at a train station on my way past. honorable mention goes to the 16 missiles and 8 fusion cores that I also donated. 
---
Quick, watch out for crows
---
Sheepsquatch isn‚Äôt supposed to be added until the Shear Terror DLC next month, probably just a bug
---
Nice camp! Toxic Valley? I teamed up with someone who had their camp there. Good place, lots of resources. Your place looks like it‚Äôs in the same spot.
---
Yeah! Let us do that.
---
That's weird, it sounded like they got it resolved earlier. Make sure to exit the launcher too and re log in. 
---
The bot that makes you choose decorations fro each of the four boxes gives you a score. I haven‚Äôt had the time to really look into it, but if this is an actual variable score, it may increase the chance of loot drops. Not sure though, seems like data mining would have found something by now if there was a special circumstance that gave you rare masks.
---
I stopped for PVE, since it was draining my cores.
---
I don't believe so, My guess would be a Two Shot with Faster Fire Rate would be the most powerful version
---
Yeah toxic valley on a lead and a junk resource. It‚Äôs a great spot but a lot of people use it so I have to jump servers a lot. 
---
BOOM headshot.
---
dont really pvp though.
---
I got an instigating rolling pin. It was as good as it  sounds. 
---
Also that little Nuka-Cola spinning light in the frat house I think it was.
---
Making a 200lb stash that's shared between all characters gives less space than increasing the stash size to 1000 for all characters...
---
I'm bout tired of wooden armor, or exterminator anything. Garbage 95% of the time. 
---
Yeah I have a full set just haven't found a plan for it yet. Do you know where one is? 
---
I was just asking just in case.
---
This one took a few hops, but I finally got it. thanks!
---
Oversee cache, drop there some,  jump server,  repeat. 
---
I actually never played new Vegas. FO4 was my first dive in. 
---
I thought fo76 will never come to steam according to the oldest article of it, guess what?! a liar hahaha lol
---
Explosive weapons cant get the explosive prefix. Two-shot was the most powerful, but instigating is probably your best bet now with various secondary effects depending on your build.
---
CIT was, the institute was basically their descendants. 
---
That all sounds like more than ‚Äúone click‚Äù ;) 
---
It doesn't run, you put your stuff in there, and wait 20 mins. Without it, your stuff would take longer to ferment. Essentially, you let your stuff spoil in there to complete it
---
No prob!
---
That's right! Been a while since I sided with the institute and got their story.
---
Oooooohhhhh! Thank you!
---
+karma for you
---
Here is a wooden box behind a bombed out keep that doesn‚Äôt have a weight cap. This combined with a lack of enemy spawns makes it a great place to transfer items between characters. Disappearing players probably means they are crouching in order to avoid attention and people trying to steal their items.
---
The camp fermenter uses up to 10 pounds of your 800 pound stash. If you have room, put things in there, leave them for awhile, and come back to fermented alcohol. The condition bar tells you how far along things are. 
---
Ngl base building in this game sucks because the chest are all the player vault or whatever 
---
I love your name
---
oh fuck! 
---
Thank you! +karma
---
That disappears when you leave, my friend and I tested it, I meant something more permanent, or at the very least, know that we're helping people. If I do that, I might as well just drop it in front of Vault 76, and hope someone gets it before it despawns. 
---
Hope karma turns around bites you.
---
Shawn of the Dead. 
---
Not if there's money involved and idiots who will waste their time watching.
---
Not the bloody version?
---
For me, it takes the skill and fun out of the game, so no.
---
I miss being able to create custom haircolor with the sliding bars...
---
76 needs sum replayability and more story tbh
---
You on pc?
---
Only works on r/market76. Just comment "+karma" on one of their comments.
---
This game has one of the most wholesome communities I know (except the toxic shit talkers)
---
I did a run with 1 bot survivor. Lots of low level helpers. No mask drop but I did get a beret. 
---
Go ahead!  I just logged off for the night, but I'll be on tomorrow.
---
Appreciated the advice, sadly, no dice.  Crit meter fills, and then nothing.  I am stuck and cannot get anymore Biv quests because of this.
---
get some sleep!
---
Other than the free copy you get from Miner Miracles? You can buy it for 200 caps (IIRC) from either the Enclave production vendor or Phoenix in Watoga plaza. 
---
 Yeah you got me there.  I'll go out on a limb here and assume that is not standard practice.  But I'm almost 400 and it's been a while since I did something that cool.  Not to knock the knife choice but I think when I try I'll use one of the musical melee for old time sake. 
---
Well i guess, but explosives on a bloodied build sounds like a recipe for disaster. But even then Junkie's has a higher damage output doesnt it. 
---
Yes but you can only move 1 point per level after 50,but it‚Äôs really not bad.levels are pretty fast and easy after 50
---
Ok, first you need to brew up what you intend to put in the fermenter. Say fermentable beer, once you have that, you then open your fermenter and put whatever fermentable alcohol you have in there, making sure the drink is checked. Anything checked will go from fermentable form to fully fledged version. This takes time, beers take shortest time, while Nukashine is currently the longest brew time. Even more if you put it back on the fermenter to make vintage Nukashine.
---
I don't know if we will get an official response / look at it...  
---
And even if we do, the event ends in a few hours, but glad there are more than a couple others putting the pieces together...
---
Big trouble in little china
---
 Aside from your good point though I'm sure you'll agree that most people play melee because of it being seen as overpowered.  
---
If it does I'm sure he will come on here and let us know. 
---
Wow... that is dedication, have me beat for "single" events...
---
They are extremely rare.  They are still in game, as there have been numerous sitings.  They are just extremely hard to get.  
---
I never managed to get the Donut recipe, no a beret.  And I have done this thing at least 20 times now.  Its just RNG, and many of us were not lucky.
---
I hope you're at least using your Green Thumb to mess with my garden.
---
If you get gifted an Excavator suit, make sure you read the plans from the terminal before you complete Miner Miracles, otherwise you'll never be able to craft Excavator yourself.
---
I would love the plans im on ps4 XxtgxkillsuxX
---
For any gauntlet
---
Ok thank you because people were telling me it wasn‚Äôt in the game.
---
No prob! Some things may take longer than than 20 mins, but just check their status every once in a while. Wait until the fermentable label drops off the drink name.. a step further,  only some can even be turned into vintage stronger versions by letting them sit for a longer while.
---
Just type +karma in the users reply. That‚Äôs it 
---
Those are just folks that are bitter that they didn't get one.
---
You have to give karma through a comment the user has made in the thread. Reply to their comment with‚Äù+karma‚Äù and the bot will automatically trigger. If they haven‚Äôt made a comment you can ask them to reply to yours so you can give prompt the command.
---
Yep
---
What im saying is that i could just put 200 lbs in that shared stash with my first character, and then take all of it out on my second character which would make the shared stash empty again and then you would repeat until you have made tons of space on your first character, my second character who could be level 2 would be able to stick stuff into his non-shared stash or just hold them and be basically a mule, i agree there should be some way to transfer between characters but i feel like this shared stash would need to a lot of restrictions so that it isnt abused
---
Well it scared me when I walked in. Not only that it was twitching too so I thought it was alive.ü•∫
---
Platform?
---
PC
---
No workie 
---
I can imagine a whole party all using psycho in the distance: *aaaAAAAAGGHHHHHH* but from like 8 different players
---
I'm getting on now
---
I cannot believe it's legal to change a ToS after a purchase and if you do not agree to it you lose said purchase.
---
There's a difference between rare and non-existent in "our ingame market and trade". Bud.
---
My plan is to roleplay in survival and PvP in adventure.
---
That is a fair point, thank you.  I've been using my 1* bloodied auto grenade launcher at like half health and it's been doing some great damage, so I'm just trying to upgrade!
---
Another quick question how long does this event last because I heard the 25 is the last day but I just want to make sure.
---
TIL there is black enclave X-01 paint somewhere.
---
It's not hate. it's more that logically speaking, if a synth can have his memories erased or reprogrammed, he's not really conscious now is he?  
---
      
---
So killing a synth isn't the same as killing a person.  
---
    
---
I used to save synths back then but realized how stupid that was.  
---
Game shop? I will check that out.
---
Instead of Guaranteed 3* , why not have Queen drop 10 weapons/armor with 50% chance of legendary. 
---
Replace rare with non existent and try again üíÄ
---
Servers are going down tomorrow morning.  I am guessing when they come back up, the event will be over
---
Haha, thanks! Usually only Fallout players get it. 
---
Lone wanderer motorcycle power armour.
---
Autobots roll out.!
---
Ok thanks again.
---
He actually asks me for broadcasts of the game and he‚Äôs interested. And he‚Äôs been playing fallout 4 as well. He‚Äôs in limbo right now in getting the game.
---
would they be wrong?
---
It won't. I have full sentinels assassin and a full squad rocking the same 
---
Not a problem.  Best of luck in the wastes.
---
Same to you.
---
As long as they don't glitch out when you try to place them and make half your camp unscrappable... 
---
I‚Äôm  just asking. All I‚Äôve read was killing and letting the bots die. What about the sloth. 
---
Probably Lvl 150+ going round claiming workshops to pvp Lvl 50s that haven‚Äôt even got a chance against him. Pathetic in my opinion. What a turd. 
---
I love the 3 star enemies who drop a drill. Just a drill. 
---
I read that in Danse's voice
---
Don't forget that they haven't been able to raise the sticker price on games for the last \~20 years, either.
---
All exploiting is is you taking advantage of a system in a way that was not intended. Contesting a workshop is for taking the workshop not going and capping people in their own home. 
---
Read the ToS.
---
I may or may not have been hoarding my extras and picking up other people's abandoned extras for this very reason... lol.
---
Ohhhh get you. That makes you impossible to kill does it? 
---
Nah. Just impossible to troll
---
Monongah and Charelston is still good. 
---
I'm at 70 runs (PC) and have had two occurrences where I did not receive a mask. Every single run I completed we had 0 robot deaths. 
---
Incredible advice, thanks!! 
---
True and it's not 0.03 it's a bugged % less than that. From what we are seeing it's no more than 2 in 9000 chance to get one according to this poll's results, and we have a week? That honestly sounds like they're playing a prank.
---
Get a grip pal.
---
Send invite my friend
---
So I didn't read that wrong. I had to go retake a workshop from enemies and it told me to retake it from sheepsquatch but when I got there it was cave crickets.  I thought I just misread it
---
They added a regular steel staircase but the railing is nicer
---
Thats amazing yay
---
I know, i feel like younger people tend to be more nihilistic as they are new to the world and havent made sense of it yet. As a result they behave erratically.
---
My only joy left in the fasnacht is one shotting the sloth before all the noobs run towards it.
---
Memories are just data. Sections of the brain are just storage. I'm pretty sure I read an article recently about scientists developing tech to erase sections of human memory, so given time reprogramming humans would surely be on the cards as well. 
---
At some point there is just no difference between a fully aware synth and a human. Gen 3s are indistinguishable from the real thing, so the morality is far more grey than you think. 
---
Thank you! 
---
+karma
---
Yeah. After 50 you can change 1 point, or get a new perk
---
And what about the pool balls that are made of plastic?
---
There are also screens in the Enclave bunker
---
Theres a list of random encounter locations and the random encounters that can happen. if you want i can send you what info i have on it
---
I see. I honestly did not know about the Crits breaking through. But staggering is still kind of hard to do even with the necessary perks, since it's just a chance, right? Or can I use a Grognak's axe to stagger player enemies as well?
---
I‚Äôve got a couple extra donut recipes if you‚Äôd like one. I‚Äôm on Xbox, though. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs an issue. 
---
I don't know how I forgot to mention that. Honestly, it's the reason why Inc game purchases are a thing. I'm just happy the content is free, and it's aesthetic things that you can purchase. 
---
Okay I will check out watoga plaza. Thanks!
---
I believe I have a spare donut but I‚Äôm not currently at home. I‚Äôll pay 500?
---
Whatever views he can get. Really scraping the bottom of the barrel.
---
There is one by the tnt domes on the road. I ran into a mr handy and a mrs nanny talking about killing people and other wierd questions. North of point plesant. Idk if its a random encounter
---
No why would he? 
---
Thanks, I saw mention of that in an earlier thread, I'll give it a try!
---
Likely 0.01 drop rate if you do the math according to the poll. 3x as likely as getting a rare outfit to drop
---
You make me wonder if he should sign out of PSN and back in.  Anything's worth a try for him at this point!
---
I have been too. I edited the post with an idea to make they more desirable too.
---
If you have the donut plan then sure.  If not then 750 if you can.  I‚Äôll be on for the next few hours btw
---
OK maybe I will but I mostly play solo and don't have that much time during the week.
---
100+? wow, I gave up after like 10 runs when I heard just how rare they are... huge gamble, such a waste of time. no offense.
---
You can already do that... It's just complicated...
---
Because I don't believe anyone has gotten one legitimately until I see a screenshot of the reward screen
---
I've been digging into the files and I've identified 4 difference categories of random spawns. Assault, scene, travel, and object. Each one of these has a different list of possible spawns at that location. The one closest to Helvetia is a Scene. That's where you get a group of enemies that generally stays put and doesn't wander far, insult bot, mannequins, a few tameables, etc. Assault is creatures fighting each other. This does not include the ones with a Deathclaw nest.  Travel has all the wandering hordes that can roam freely, pied piper bot, as well as the responder vendor bot. This is the one immediately east of Charleston Station. Object is the ones people are farming; lemonade stand, civil war reenactor, crashed satellite, etc. That's what the one by the overseer's camp and just south of Slocum's Joe are. 
---
To add to this, there seems to be another list per location that can exclude encounters found on the master list. That's why you don't find a trick-or-treater at the overseer's camp location. I haven't fully deciphered this mechanic yet.
---
From what I can tell, there appears to be 3,000 random encounter placeholders on the map. Whether or not all these spawn an encounter, I don't know. It could be there may be several placeholders per map marker that make the magic happen. If someone can help me figure out the coordinate system, I would love to turn these placeholders into a map with an identifier of which locations spawn which encounters. It seems some of the placeholders are triggers, so maybe the spot where you can go that will trigger the encounter to spawn. I don't know.
---
There are also well over 100 possible random encounters. There are an additional dozen that only happen at Whitespring and about a dozen more than involve the Sheepsquatch. Some of them do things like spawning a non-aggressive scorchbeast that fly around (like in the forest) or shakes the ground (like in the ash heap). There are also special ones that only happen during a nuke zone. But they appear to just be higher level spawns of the normal ones. There are also a handful of cut ones, like one called Mama Bear that you can guess what it's about.
---
please do!
---
It was a game stop type store trying to dump hard copies. Point being you can find good deals on hard copies
---
I‚Äôll be on Thursday. I can do 750
---
Yes bro but I am a collector, i have or have access to every rare item in this game. I want these masks, even if only one.
---
That PA looks really thick
---
And you wonder why people called you on your shit. Your a griefer and a really stupid one at that. If your going to grief, don't post your spoils on Reddit then get defensive when people call you a cunt 
---
Ew a facebook link
---
Indeed, that is one of them.  Can you be a bit more specific about the location?
---
I've started leaving them and technical data turn in outfits at the overseer's camp and the dumpster behind big al's tattoo parlor.
---
Shotguns/Heavy guns/Melee
---
Enclave officer uniform 
---
Oh ok then.  I should be available at around 6 or 7 Pacific time
---
Ya'll Mfers need an intervention. I hover around 60lbs before heading out of the house and my stash is around 600. It was 400ish but I started to save 2-3 star legendaries for the new vendor. Since the start of the game I've never had a problem with storage. Only keep what you need!
---
Lol, I told you. I made Fasnacht Man to prove the devs were full of bull.
---
He's level 28 now I believe and 10+ luck and 15 charisma aint worth jack. Per your own results there's no reason for me to give him my grape mentats, moonshine, or sweet rolls to further boost it. And usually folks will join my group so I just share the charisma boosting perk and sit at 20 charisma anyway. Over all it's clear that they don't drop on PC for some reason.
---
My guess is they are trying to find the masks from the dev room and hope that by putting out the line that they are super rare people will out themselves and save Bethesda a bit of work.
---
More than three tattoos in general with less generic locations. This is super important. If I can‚Äôt smoke or deface my body, how else am I to express myself?
---
I found plastic on pool balls. What are you talking about?
---
i think ill take you up on the offer for those paints, what time u or ur friend available on xbox?
---
I would imagine it's because the most powerful variants have the explosive attribute, and it is a close range build -- so potentially quite suicidal?  I still use a TSE shotgun with my rifle build though, as it does great against grouped up mobs
---
Pool balls in real life aren‚Äôt made of plastic 
---
Ya but i doubt bethesda wants any character to be just a pack mule and so they wont want to implement the shared stash so that it is a lot easier for people
---
It screws with me too
---
Wait till tomorrow then rage quit...... jk come back anytime.
---
Oh, definitely.
---
This was my idea to fix workshops 
---
Workshops Rebuilt:
---
Upon activating a workshop you get 3 options. First is single claim. 
---
Single claim is a workshop and you setup. You pay a smaller and flatter cap few.You do all the building and maintaining it. Another player let‚Äôs call them Nora can go up to the workshop bench and request to join the place putting up a cap fee. As the owner you can chose to let them in or deny them. If Nora is accepted she can build and collect resources. 
---
Option two: multi claim. 
---
Multi claim allows you to claim the location as a team. Paying a larger cap fee. The team is James, Nate, Nora and Kellogg. Each of you is equal to the workshop. All can build, collect and destroy items at will. Same rules as before. How ever each one of you can be killed and lose the place. 
---
The final option is: Raid claim
---
Raiding is an option where here let‚Äôs say Preston wanted the location but didn‚Äôt get there in time. 
---
Instead of requesting to join Preston can engage pvp with you only as you as the only one in single claim. 
---
If you die Preston gets the location no cap cost. One on on pvp. 
---
If Preston has a team and goes to the above teams location both teams engage in pvp and the winning team gets the location. It‚Äôs a one life battle. 
---
As extra flavour any time you or member of your workshop makes caps from events or quests a small amount will be sent to all claimed locations to help with building defense bots and repairs to the location in question. 
---
Tarantula!
---
Dude all these people giving you shit for this is total bs. PvP is a part of the game and they need to accept that. Nice loot haul üëç
---
I voted, you have some good ideas but it be cool to try an keep things as lore friendly as possible. Things like ghillie suits, while cool would be impractical since the game already uses active camouflage as it's stealth technology. 
---
The camp is a really cool idea, I've always wanted to place small camps without losing my main base. Having bunkers and other pre built locations to work around would be really cool. We already see players get creative using the world, imagine if Bethesda implemented locations specifically for building, like a workshop but more permanent and meant to act as a player settlement
---
Elaborate...
---
I hope the divide skins you alive. 
---
I disagree.  (Or there is more in play)
---
I specifically was farming one if the spawn point near the oversee camp and I needed to mark if I already search that server. 
---
Load a crap of junk like bones shards
---
Drop a single piece for server 1
---
2 for server 2
---
And so on. 
---
Occasionally I was dumped on a old server with,  let's say 33 bone shards.
---
The chances that another player just dropped 33 bone shards are impossibly slim. 
---
I dont wonder. People are weal, that's all.
---
Well he has GameStop and EB games.
---
Yes.  I enjoy doing gross amounts of damage with critical hits and head shots. 
---
I thought it was all wood. You wouldn't happen to link the specific post would you he has so many 
---
Well then maybe the executives of these companies shouldn‚Äôt be getting paid so much. It‚Äôs not the buyers fault that things are this way. It‚Äôs greed from people on top. 
---
Ok. 
---
I'm level 86 and have done it 4 times with no problems
---
Maybe folks shouldnt leave the robots. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
But I am not worried. üòè
---
So I can‚Äôt seem to get the same results I did to get what I got. So I‚Äôll say your right for now. And keep trying to replicate what I did. 
---
Thanks bro. They are just salty because they have been killed too much.
---
I‚Äôm looking at my shelf and 76 is the best game. It has extreme value and it is by far the best game I‚Äôve played in years. You‚Äôre the one getting upset and trying to call me names because you‚Äôre giving false reviews.  
---
Cool thank you appreciated 
---
To other players yes. To vendors no. 
---
I just drag the beast and ash pile the wolves and bugs. 
---
As far as I can remember, there is no reward for buying/playing precious fallout games.
---
You can name your character anything but other players will only see your account username. 
---
If your interested in getting your shit kicked in and losing all your hard earned stuff to a level 200 god build, then survival launches tomorrow so there that. If you'd looking for more fun stuff to do I'd honestly say wait another few weeks. Once the majority of wild Appalachia had been our, then the game will be more appealing to you
---
I solo'd my first silo last weekend (lvl 70ish). Got to the keypad and punched in the wrong goddamned silo code. Wow, I was pissed.
---
Anyways I went back and did it this weekend and dropped my first bomb. On Helvetia. 
---
does anyone know if you have fix it good and weapon artisan to repair your stuff to 200% - will this perk do anything if youre repair is over 100%?  and worst case if it is more than 100% Im wondering if it will actually repair 'down' to 100% when it procs... 
---
It's "tolerable" but a lot of the legendary guns that were awesome n fun got so severely nerfed that certain builds aren't fun anymore
---
This thread is full of spoilers oh god no   
---
I‚Äôd turn the game off or server hop. Receiving free stuff the second I start a game is the biggest turn off I could possibly imagine. I‚Äôve tried to explain this before on another post where people incessantly pat themselves on the back for trying to fork over their leftovers and was met by a barrage of downvotes. 
---
Not everyone wants a handout the second they are about to be immersed in a new game. 
---
I too am on Xbox.  I have spare balloons, and Sausage recipes 
---
You cannot sell them to vendors, but you can sell them to other players.  Try r/market76 or r/fo76bazaar to find a trading partner.
---
Or drop them at a lower level player's feet or something.
---
But as long as you already know it then you will be able to use it even if you do t have the hard copy? 
---
If only metal structures were impervious to most forms of damage, then we might have some interesting survival encounters
---
Maybe he was just processing more of Kellogg's memories...

This is Knight Captain Luscious, Always good to see a new scribe amongst us! Welcome aboard https://discord.gg/5NuAU8
---
If you're messing with someone who was being a general asshole first, it's not griefing. You were just happily messing with him. I love it lmao
---
More and more this is looking like the root of the issue, we still don't a confirmed drop on PC of an Uncommon or Rare, but we have all of these instances when no Mask was awarded when it should have been...
---
Oops. sorry mate. didn't expect fo76 players to not have finished fallout 4.
---
People are what? 
---
Snipe turrets from a distance and I'm in.
---
I realised a few weeks ago the turrets all have a max distance. AI and players can shoot past that distance.
---
Sucks your tickets will be pointless cause bethesda CS doesn‚Äôt have the ability to return items 
---
They seem to be the best in terms of how much damage they can take at least.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Your not thinking long term. What if you have 5 legitimate characters?
---
Yes. You already learned it. The known plans just add weight.
---
The shotguns that were great are pretty useless now. Even with "ideal" perk builds.  
---
I used to decimate 2 - 3 scorch beass at once in less than 5 minutes. And now it takes a shit ton of rounds and the scorch beasts are just a nuisance since their drops are pathetic and not worth the stimpacks and ammo
---
I'll check there now! Thank you for the tip! :D
---
Thank you!!!
---
I‚Äôve held all the workshops at once. It started with just a few of them but then kind of turned into my own personal quest to rule the workshop world. 
---
After about ten of them it starts getting hard to keep up with the defend workshop. 
---
I think my favorite was Sunshine meadows. The junk, concrete and aluminum extractors are nice to have in one spot. That and no one really seems to want to contest for that one. 
---
Apparently, never should have entered the vault.....
---
With so much runs, do you have a beret to spare??
---
I don't even bother anymore. Every time I get into building them I get kicked off the server well to be fair I stopped playing 2 or 3 months ago server could be more stable 
---
Thank you captain! Ad Victoriam 
---
I will add -lunarknight
---
Oh I'm just joking, haha. The game is years old, social etiquette on spoilers is well past. :-p
---
I didn't know Danse was really a synth though, interesting... I never did play the BoS line!
---
What do you mean?
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Judging from my Karma losing a point, I blocked the guy who enjoys hearing himself talk. I hope my original post was atleast contributed to your issue.
---
Disco Ball Plans!!!
---
Lol I remember, 100 is just impressive!  
---
  
---
As for the drops, at this point I'm not convinced they have dropped at all... 
---
The Duping and Dev Room exploting was much worse (as I understand it) on console, which could explain almost all of the pic's we've seen.  
---
If you're correct I'd think it would backfire and cause a massive blowback from the community.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Nothing a fusion generator can't fix. Or 2.
---
Oh ok good.  
---
I believe there's more than one character you've met that slipped past your nose as synths :)
---
Yo what‚Äôs up neighbor? I live in the ash heap too right next to a lead deposit. 
---
Surething 
---
Only neighbours near my camp are giant sloths, let me ask them for some sugar.
---
Update: sloths didn't have sugar, they didn't like my build spot and leveled it. One appeared to be running a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet because that bitch one tapped me
---
Must be easy when you face dumbasses.
---
I stand corrected
---
On XB1? I'll give you one. 
---
I'm going to assume anyone that levels your camp unprovoked is just a griefer and won't have an actual camp. They usually don't carry caps either so they give nothing back if you kill them.
---
LMAO
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted, but this seems to be the best thing to do if it just *happened*
---
It'd be better to be safe than sorry, even though you're loosing a dope item, it'd be better to put in a ticket to let the devs know what happened, so blame isn't shifted OP's way via a ban.
---
Gotten surprisingly few overall, but I'm planning to give out my surplus when this is all over.
---
I saw the Jester last night on PS4. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/FoJqM08
---
I have a Mario I can send to you that I have been making
---
And how do you know its unprovoked ? Someone can say the wrong thing a provoke people, no way for Bethesda to really know.
---
Juicehead was one of those youtubers I was following for a while. He had some informative videos, but then I started to notice he'd post on any rumors he read on Reddit, even reporting on unconfirmed stories (like various bans). Anything negative, no matter how minor, and he'd seem to make a video about it. Got old fast.
---
I really need like one more point, or the ability to break up ranked cards. Five points would eliminate most of the annoying card swapping.
---
Shotguns were op before the TSE nerf, now they are below being effective. Using adrenal and 3 shotgun perks I barely hit 400 damage. I'm sure a little changing could make it do more, but why since leveling up is ridiculous after 100. Plus you only use shotgun shells. I have heavy weapon perks and rifleman, which means I can use 10+ types of weapons and ammo, rather than rely on shotgun shells only.
---
I don't know about dropping the quest but you can see what the recipe is by going to a brewing station and looking at the ingredients 
---
Raider time
---
I died there while server hopping and lost all my junk....      
---
Nice.  
---
Not saying it was you, but who knows :)  
---
Ad Victoriam, I look forward to seeing your reports o7
---
Gimme my Warhawk back bethesday!
---
To be blunt with you man, i think if you just stop sprinting when in PA, that may entirely fix your problem. 
---
Gotta cash in on the "I hate Fallout 76!" bandwagon. 
---
I killed a 3* super mutant and 3 Scorchbeast near Sunnytop. Got a 3* pitchfork and a plasma gatling. Ffs rng
---
If you get the task before 8 but finish it after, do you not get another till the next day?
---
I don't think you did
---
Did Edna send you?
---
I won‚Äôt disappoint!
---
A Mario, huh? lol I'm guessing you were trying to swype "map", sure I'll take a look
---
Lol he‚Äôs like the king of the Hate losers. 
---
Sent it as a chat sorry
---
Why would anyone want to aim-bot? üòÇ
---
Now that you mention it, my camp hasn‚Äôt been attacked once since I planted my scarecrow. But it‚Äôs probably just coincidence. Why would creatures be scared of a scarecrow if they‚Äôre not even scared of us in our giant power armor?
---
I found it. Did not know that it was there. Never saw it before this evening.
---
They trade those off to a partner to pass to an alt.  It‚Äôs why they run two or more to a group.
---
Sorry. Auto correct. Weak. 
---
I've done it a slightly different way, but I don't mind logging in once the thing pops up. I don't however want that secondary, unnecessary launcher running along side (which I prefer Steam for the overlay). 
---
I'm a wee bit peeved that they are *now* adding a bunch of BGS games to Steam. Who needs frigging Blizzard, Origin, BGS, GoG, and Steam all installed? 
---
Just south of where awol arrangements has a random my house is there and I get random encounters all the time
---
Barely south west of the lead deposit there
---
If you can't see that this is not the way it was intended, you have a problem. 
---
If you are on xbox I can help for the mats.
---
I just bought the game yesterday and have set it up to play tomorrow haha. Oh well. :)
---
Lol you got it
---
Hmm, no fun, sorry to hear that. 
---
I had it hiccup on me last night doing the entry BoS quest and I'm not a bit worried its stuck as well. The option on the Terminal never appeared that would allow me to finish, now I gotta go clear that damned place again. 
---
I feel you bruh
---
In theory it would be cool, but if the base game thought me anything. It's that most players will shoot on site.
---
Head a bit north by the nuclear disposal faculity
---
Yeah, I camped just north of the relay tower for over a month and never saw it.
---
Not everybody wants to give steam a 30% cut of their sales for doing shit all.  For small companies the exposure may be worth it but none pf the big companies need what steam offers.  Its just throwing money away.  
---
Lol. Ok bro. Come back to me when Bethesda acknowledges this as "unintended".
---
Not trying to sound ignorant, but 400 would seem to be enough to one or 2 shot most enemies... my lever action rifle only does 134 and I kill most things in 1-4 shots. Maybe because im only level 51?
---
The first time I attempted to claim the workshop and do this quest was awful. I was doing a workshop defense and a squad showed up to help me defend. This kinda ticked me off as they were all triple digits and I was in the 20s and they were one shotting everything...
---
Once the defense was over they started trying to claim the workshop from me. I wouldn't leave the area so one approached me and one shot me. Didn't realize they could initate pvp by claiming the workshop.  
---
Really turned me off from the game and I've reduced my playing time and avoid me higher leveled players. I did finally go back and complete this last night though!
---
Jesus lmao, I bet that put a good dent in your caps. When it comes to contesting I have never had one of my workshops contested, so far it seems everyone keeps to themselves except for occasionally wandering over and checking it out.
---
Yes. It even happened on console. 
---
Also....praise MOTH
---
Probably won't be on until 8 or 9 am est
---
I think tagging the CMs could be usefull though I doubt they'll give any more information about the event or even have any about this situation
---
I started playing less than a month ago and it's all been stable for me until the past couple days. Been a lot of disconnecting.
---
They are in the game, people accessed some through the dev room... that‚Äôs about it though. 
---
I'm not saying that was it, I just know he has alot of plans.
---
I attempted my first nuke at level 55 three weeks ago. Solo attempt. Got through it all no problem, but my dumbass didn‚Äôt prepare for this and screwed up the launch code. Still not even positive where or how to get the code. Anyways, still pissed about it and haven‚Äôt tried it since. 
---
God people who do that are scumbags, gives me flashbacks to trolls on gta and ark
---
I think that I have a spare legendary tesla and I can build them now
---
It was the SR71 Blackbird paint, popped up on the Atom store for 1800 caps one day only. The tricentennial PA paint is also a dark blue
---
I'll have to check this one tomorrow, thanks!
---
Oi. 150 levels later they kick your ass
---
I just scream into my headset. Since I'm playing as myself, it adds to the realism. :P
---
VATS destroys power cores
---
The irony of someone, who gets enjoyment from being an ass hole in videogames, calling another person weak. 
---
Exactomundo!
---
I say this all the time but I am fairly certain none of my friends get that it's a reference
---
When I started last month I reached Sutton Station I think it was called. I was spooking at the stuff and a level 283 melee'd me to death. I didn't know what was going on until it was to late and proceeded to camp my bag of stuff (at a low level was useful for me).
---
I gave the game another shot a few days later. After an hour of play, I grabbed an unowned workshop (The Poseidon Nuclear plant I think it's called in the lower left if the map). I got it and defended it, after a while, I see it's under attack. I go there and nothing is there. Then this guy with a bounty of 100 caps was crouched and invisible just one shot me by melee. 
---
Stopped playing for about 3 weeks, so far it's been nice but I have no once seen any friendly players. It's mostly been negative.
---
My first encounter with another player was during BETA when he wandered into my camp to ask for corn.  He was making a farm nearby.  I told him to take what he wanted from the eight I had and he could take anything else he needed.  I‚Äôd already located a few of the farms and had a little of everything.  
---
First friend on 76.
---
They limited the number of certain items you can build at your camp in the last patch. 
---
Issue is I never received the plans for it. Is it something we can buy off a vendor?
---
I had around 900 damage last week with a junkies explosive double barrel before adrenaline.  Add 60% more for adrenaline rank 5.  Double that with a sneak attack. 
---
Also easily achieved with my Bloodied Explosive pump. Seems viable to me. Just need to build for the weapon or vice-versa. 
---
Mind sharing the nuke codes?
---
Thanks but it seems I need the plans for it. Do you know if it‚Äôs purchasable?
---
Xbox sorry
---
Great news. I will re-buy it on Steam just for the convenience (on sale though). 
---
I just talked to biv, then when I went to the fermenter the recipe was in there. üëç
---
There‚Äôs a few people who posted pictures of rare masks but it‚Äôs all down to if you‚Äôre lucky or not since they have a 0.03% drop rate 
---
Yessss please Bethesda (would buy them in the atomic shop even)
---
So fucking annoying when a muty kept shooting my wall from orbit.  There was one resource node I like but I had to move because of that. 
---
It's certainly not how you get kids... However you do obtain mods that way. Handmade mods have a lower chance of unlocking then other guns, but I've most of them by using this method.
---
When ever I use a handmade it‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt have kids 
---
Its random chance to get the mods, but yes, we are positive
---
So typical rng screwing the player base to try and make them stay.
---
Way to destiny my fallout 
---
I'm on now. server hopping fashnact
---
Juicehead will literally make a video about anything. Rumors? There's a video about it. Drama? There's a Juicehead video about that. Something datamind? Gotta make long ass speculative video about it. Maybe two. Negative press? Video. Something he thought he heard about 76 while the wind was blowing? Video'd.
---
Literally anything that happens, no matter how minor, true, false, or completely unconfirmed... and he'll make a video about it.
---
Make sure to run skeet shooter rank 3 for accuracy and range and enforced rank 3 for crippling. 
---
How he do dat
---
That's a good looking camp :D Nice job
---
It‚Äôs easy and within the rules.  It ain‚Äôt right, but it ain‚Äôt wrong yet according to the gods.
---
Juice who?   Lol ;)
---
Not all of them; pre nerf, TSEs were hitting well over 1k, which translated to one-shotting pretty much everything bar the Queen.
---
Unsure on how is everything nowadays (Haven‚Äôt played since January, waiting for more content) but 400 shouldn‚Äôt be enough to two-shot some enemies like Glowing Deathclaws, Mirelurk Queens and the likes.
---
That would be amazing I‚Äôm trying to get the auto barrel mod
---
Is love to replicate this and hand out some summer masks anyone know how? Pm me 
---
i do not.  so your statement is a fallacy. 
---
I have disliked power armor since 4. I wish it wasn‚Äôt mandatory for end game content. 
---
Darn :/ One brahmin seems ridiculous to me. I can understand not having more then 4. Thanks for the reply!
---
How often do you plan on running it? I can help out on the weekends.
---
Somewhat yes, rng always likes to mess things up, Bethesda on the other hand mentioned in a thread they‚Äôll be fixing this issue for the next limited time events so it won‚Äôt be as super rare to come across a drop item 
---
To keep it with the whole mood/aesthetics of Fallout, pretty much any movie from the ‚Äúdrive-in era‚Äù would be perfect.
---
Thinking gems like ‚Äúthe blob‚Äù, ‚Äúthem‚Äù, ‚Äúforbidden planet‚Äù, etc...
---
Lol for this comment 
---
I had dropped a full set of T60 power armor bc I was working on it and didn't want to keep placing it back down if I went off to get a couple things from my stash or whatever... the server dropped and when I came back the whole thing was, of course, gone. 
---
I could have cried.
---
Lol for the comment 
---
That may be the case, but it wont make up for this one. They knew it wouldn't go over well. Somebody had to know
---
Dont listen too much to meta rats. The real usefulness of shotguns have always been their insane crowd control. With enforcer, you can break anything's legs for an easy kill. Plus, you're a literal god against robots especially gutsy, 3 bullets to their limbs and they just drop dead. 
---
The Bethesda servers had issues today. Fallout 76, legends, and iso had issues. He runs a ‚Äúinformative‚Äù channel. This affected PC players specifically. 
---
I have a basement that I'm making into a bar like area. My C.A.M.P is on the se side of a cliff so it also serves as a great observation platform.
---
Just think of how rich we‚Äôll be with the millions of future players joining FO76 who want to pay us 5000 caps for an Owl mask...
---
Nukacrypt.com or something like that. Use google. Type nukacrypt
---
With how bad my last victim lag jumped around,I had to use vats on him...
---
It probably is duper‚Äôs 
---
If you received the quest you also received the recipe.  It won‚Äôt be in your inventory or stash.  It‚Äôs an automatic recipe.  
---
The only hard part is the stable crimson flux.
---
Tried that, not updated for this week yet 
---
yeah I need a rick grimes hairstyle and beard
---
get a gun with increased vats chance =&gt; headshot for days
---
Make sure you have room in your stash as well. For some reason the two are linked.
---
85 is as far as it can go before things are way too distorted and mess up your spatial awareness. 
---
Same thing happened to me!
---
My tesla rifle switched ammo capacity with my gatling gun. A 150 round magazine on an automatic TS tesla rifle.
---
Kinda nice, but not worth getting banned over an accidental glitch.
---
Make the fridge like an opposite fermenter. It's connected to your stash, is limited by the number of items you can place, and instead of accelerating condition loss make it halt it (like when it's in a paper bag).
---
The suppressor is the bugger that's eluding me currently. Pretty sure there's been at least 20 handmade produced so far.
---
Melee doesn't have a stagger perk. Staggers are easy with shotguns and heavy weapons and the right perks.
---
I just want to do it just this one time (i have alpha and bravo codes but only one nuke key card) but if it goes to plan or ppl enjoy it then i might do it more. Also I might be busy over the weekend but if you and I are friends on the PS then I could tell you if I will be on or not 
---
Oh I use vats on the sentinel kids who just hold still for me.
---
F- it I‚Äôm in
---
Simmer down, Miranda Lambert.
---
This is screwy
---
Worlds full. In que
---
From what I've seen in this thread, you probably did this and got all the junk but were more excited about the prospect of coming to post about it on reddit. You seem to take pride in being an asshole on a game. Nice.
---
I saw the Flatwoods Monster just west of the fair grounds golf course thing 
---
I don‚Äôt always craft Handmades. But when I do... kids
---
Do you need the crafting perks like gunsmith equipped to get the mods? I know I framed it really stupidly, but it feels like I‚Äôm doing something wrong 
---
Oh now I understand what you are saying
---
Do you mean sugar???
---
What score did the decorator give you? 
---
Damned if they do, damned if they don't. 
---
Either way it's clear the masks aren't dropping for one reason or another and at this point they aren't fixing the drop rates to save face from publicized articles about the blunder.
---
Oh, I think you mean strangler bloom, the ingredient in RadShield. They spawn in the Mire, further east. 
---
Nope just make it and break it, bad streaks happen 
---
"Fallout Divergence" aside, modern pool balls are made out of phenolic resin, which is a type of plastic. Similar argument to an in-game pencil containing "lead", I suppose. 
---
What would happen if you removed cars and caps are over limit?
---
The original RTS mod for fallout 3 that the settlement system took inspiration let you place new interior cells in your settlement. I wish we could place a small storm cellar or something like it.
---
I'm in for sure
---
I think we could do this in older fallouts
---
Your friends are synths 
---
Beautiful! Love your layout.

(Hears Fasnacht parade music at the thought of making all those caps of the summer newbs! :)
---
Well 1950 era faux tech pencils were made of lead hell pencils were still made of lead in the 80‚Äôs when I was a kid
---
As far as I know can only get from Biv quests. If it is required for Biv, obtaining for others progresses quest as if you had crafted it.
---
This happens to me on Xbox, usually when I lose the Trade option too. Worst when trying to sell my inventory!!
---
How many handmade mods do you know already? The more you know the less chance you have of unlocking new ones.
---
Nice! I solo launched my first nuke in the upper 30s, then solo launched another in the high 40s and my last one at level 50. Didn't have an issue crashing with either of them. It's pretty fun and feels rewarding to watch the thing blast off. Would be nice if I had people to do nuke runthroughs with. Nuke zones are disappointing when TSEs are present, but when they're not it's pretty fun.
---
I'm glad you like them and I'm trying my best. Apparently the ghillie suit was talked about so I added it to allow others to be happy.
---
The idea of a permanent player settlement is good. I heard of T.O.W.N. as the idea.
---
None
---
Didn‚Äôt he make a video about the guy who played for 900 hours when all it was was some rumors?
---
What is with so many people jumping to this conclusion? They're so rare that you'll likely never even see one in game even on another players head. That bothering people doesn't mean they think everyone should have all of them.
---
Codes reset at 7pm est today, now only known ones are alpha and Charlie 
---
Someone mentioned earlier but I can confirm that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have the ability to return an item to inventory, this seems odd and not very plausible, but it is the story they give.
---
Psa if you have unstoppable iso or the electrical melee mutation then that return damage can initiate pvp on your behalf. I learned this the hard way. If you use these stay in pacifict mode untill you sre ready to fight.
---
I‚Äôm only mad I didn‚Äôt think to do this funny stuff!
---
Don't get me wrong a ghillie suit would be really cool, I would personally love a ghillie suit over a Chinese stealth suit.
---
Someone posted on here it's like a 0.03% drop rate for masks considered rare.
---
I agree!
---
and my 2cents ( and probably unpopular opinion but) ... until building bugs are fixed and plans are obtainable for new things in a reasonable way (not all found in the atoms shop for a very hefty price) I have no desire to play. (and no I don't mind even buying atoms with real money but current atom shop prices are so inflated for tiny rewards I feel ripped off.)
---
I miss playing and I love this game - easily one of my favorite games ever but I finally had to walk away and take a break. I started playing in beta and love building but it fell very short with new content or current content fixed. 
---
I seriously want bugs fixed more than anything so I can tolerate playing but new build content would be even more awesome!!
---
Yeah, that point had me stumped for half a day. Max load in stash and the fermenter wouldn't accept anything.
---
RAWR! BRING IT!
---
Should get them from powering up power plants
---
6am est 
---
May be removed with the downtime which is suppose to happen later 
---
Any of the power plant missions to get the entire place running again award various plans. You also don't need to do the optional objectives to get the plans.
---
Three is the most I've ever gotten and got disconnected from the server soon after. Was really sad. The airport in Charleston is pretty awesome. I love repairing the artillery guns and being able to summon a vertibot to fight for you is pretty cool.
---
You can get a free one on the fourth floor of the Asylum :)
---
Johnny cash sings like I talk when I first wake up.
---
Literally nothing is gonna change except y'all get new servers but okay lol
---
ah cool! I only knew about the one, I did this daily for months too.
---
slip187o.  jump in whenever
---
Im partial to RAWR! BRING IT!
---
u have to do the Power Up X Power Station event to get those plans, all power plants rewards u with a power generator u don't already know and it works down the list so if u don't have a large, fusion and wind, u will get the Large than the Fusion then lastly the wind one, so u might have to do these multiply times till u get the generator u want
---
Lol should‚Äôve figured that. Thanks
---
I just use two 75‚Äù 4k TVs and two PS4 pros, and use 8 characters. All have a name for everything they mule. I I use a iPad Pro with pen to organize all my characters and spend at least 2 to 3 hours of my 12/14 hour day just organizing and running trains to sell the prior days loots. (Yes I‚Äôm in early retirement ) I just broke 1000 hours and would never play this long if I had to use one character and one box. I‚Äôm ready for the legendary vendor. I have over 2000 lbs of 1 to 3 star guns and armor to trade out. This will take a burden off the players looking to mule between boxes because I will retire several of them. I‚Äôve been hoarding since the beginning and can you imagine after 100+ Queen drops I‚Äôve had to store? I don‚Äôt sell anything with a legendary status. And still have over 100k caps. I love this game but hate the limitations. 
---
The vendor limit takes care of raking in the caps anyway...
---
I‚Äôm in
---
According to Beth there was nothing wrong with the drop rates so there was nothing to fix.
---
I scrapped probably 50-100 arms after I unlocked everything else and I never got dense. I've read that you can't scrap-learn anything with a plan. 
---
Wow I must have overlooked it, I feel stupid thanks a bunch
---
which event and what was wrong with it ? 
---
Should have waited a few more level for super duper, I‚Äôm level 45.
---
honestly don't know, I have tried almost every combo...  
---
Is there a secret I've missed?
---
It's a hot commodity for those who are hunters
---
Everyone is indeed gonna think it‚Äôs safe to take workshops 
---
Fasnacht. We never got the 5 glitched masks.
---
Damn, that's what I thought. I'm not either of those builds, I'm bloodied right now. Which is not for PVP of course, but at least I know now that I have to crit everyone.
---
Yet another award winner for ‚Äúoutstanding use of reddit as if were google!‚Äù
---
Thats really sad. Only like 10 people got them. I really wanted them.
---
How fucking dense are you?  After tomorrows patch THERE IS NO MORE PVP GRIEFING IN ADVENTURE.  They're taking fucking slap damage out.  It's gone.  If you have pacifist on the ONLY thing someone can do is annoy you by wasting their time and ammo shooting you in the head and dealing zero damage.
---
No worries.  I‚Äôve been playing since day 1 and still find myself lost at times.
---
Works great for me \*shrug\*
---
SQL query on the database to check for who was holding masks that were only available from the dead room would be really easy.
---
I'm leaning more towards a bug glitch or error or somebody actually thinking it was a brilliant idea to make these things so absolutely impossible to get.
---
&gt; Personally I'm not insinuating the lied, Just suggesting there is an error / problem with the event
---
Yeah I don't think they did this on purpose, they probably just didn't know about the bug or what ever it is when they said that.
---
But because of what they said people have been wasting their time in an endless farming, and so many people clamining this was intended as a rare drop despite no one ever getting any not common mask out of thousands of players.
---
If they existed, they would have probably already dropped and posted somewhere the first day, F76 has a big enough amount of playerbase. Shame really because the event is fun and the Camp items are great, but the masks were one of the main features and we only got like 5.
---
I get enjoyment from getting more stuff in the game. Haha
---
Did you get any masks other than the soldier, owl, witch, giant, toothy man?
---
Are you trying to say you want to be able to steal from other players by invading their camps?
---
Same, was fun... got some worthless masks... did something with large groups. Was silly af!!
---
Would it not be a radio theater since its audio only?!
---
Nah. I was just excited about the amount of junk.
---
Does the drum mag functionally appear on the weapon model, or due you manually reload 75 individual rounds each time you're out? Still, wow.
---
Those crops could use a trim though...
---
Where are you guys gonna nuke??
---
Yep. IN fact, he made multiple videos about it. Those videos are the ones that made me give up on the guy. The entire story was ludicrous from the get-go.
---
The banned guy's excuse was "Oh, I just transferred 100,000+ rounds of ultracite ammo between me and a mule and it triggered their anti-cheat system." Anybody who read that excuse should have instantly been suspect of that claim.
---
The idea that somebody had tens of thousands of ultracite rounds is kind of ludicrous (the flux requirements for crafting ammo in bulk are huge), especially to the point they'd be trading that ammo back and forth constantly. If you have Bandolier (and most people do) ammo weighs almost nothing. There'd no reason to swap it between mules constantly. The idea people are running around with 10K+ ultracite ammo is just exceedingly unrealistic.
---
And Juicehead should have known that. 
---
I don't think anyone got them legit. Only dev room glitchers
---
Don't listen to the people crying about nerfs and saying wait for more content... There's an 80+ hour main story that everyone seems to forget they completed awhile ago. I don't know what you mean by playable, because apparently everyone has their own definition of that.. But in terms of server stability and bugs, yes these have all improved ten fold since launch with a number of quality of life changes to boot.
---
Servers seem pretty stable, at least on Xbox. I have only been kicked off once recently over a few irl days.
---
I got a dope ass picture with a moth man patrolling the area I think he may be common in this area also 
---
Saw Battlestation1 get a skull, another streamer got a jester. Not broken just rare. took me 150 hours to get my first TSE. Rare is rare
---
I'd really like to see a staircase like the foundation staircase, a full square of stair, that you can place -on top- of foundation and upper floor pieces so I can make my grand temple to the deathclaw god as i envisioned it
---
Meh, rare is rare. Maybe the rarest ones will be the common ones next fastsnatch. I'm not a huge fan of any of them anyway. I enjoyed the event, got everyone together, good spot for some trading, I had fun. Thanks fo76 community.
---
Oooooooh fishy,  fishy, fishy fish! That went wherever i did go.
---
They decided to give is another ‚Äò‚ÄôIt just works ;)‚Äô‚Äô 
---
Nice, I found that arch as well but my first instinct was to do the air guitar pose under it and take a screenshot. 
---
Wendigo Cave for sure
---
Coz I'd just switch servers during the 2 minute nuke warning... c'mon dude, think like us to stop us
---
Perhaps in the new pvp servers and it could make a reason to close your doors or add better locks to the lockpick skill 
---
I like to get the power plants because I can get fusion cores while I do other things and my camp is by a power plant.
---
The most ammo of a certain weapon I had in the game was the pipe weapons at 553 ammo, and most of it was just from the Whitesprings golf course ghouls or the scorched in Charleston.
---
A website called NukaCrypt has the current launch codes for each silo. If you‚Äôre garbage at the decryption thing then just use that place like I did. 
---
His video specifically says "Fallout 76 servers crashed after Bethesda announced move to steam". Very informative. 
---
You could be right, and I think this is likely the last time I invest so heavily, time and effort wise, it's just not worth the return.  
---
**Sidebar:**  
---
What Bethesda keeps not mentioning, and I keep trying to hammer home, there are Uncommon (3) and Rare (2) masks, and we aren't seeing either grouping drop.
---
I know I know semantics.
---
Honestly not trying to nitpick here, it's just uncommon by definition should be, well slightly less common than the 5 we keep seeing...   
---
Just for god(s) sake want to see some of the uncommons, if not the rares...  
---
But I'm done for the night ('76) and I think it ends tomorrow morning..
---
But having 10k ammo in 900 hours of play? Not possible without some form of cheating or duplication.
---
Will it really matter though? Dust off that 2shot explosive weapon and become the minecraft creep your parents always claimed you to be
---
He played on the chess team. He can't lie.
---
I'll be a new player. I play on PS4, but am slowly transitioning to PC. I just can't justify the purchase at full price again. If it drops in price on steam, I'm there. 
---
I've wasted so many hours trying to figure this out. Mostly I've been server hopping in the toxic valley (found deep pocketed and ultralight this way) but I've taken "breaks" from that almost heaven to do maps (100% trash) and technical data (also trash).
---
Aside from the one-off rare spawns that I suspect are possible with nearly any event or plan spawn, the only thing I can think to do is farm the Grafton monster in Hemlock. It should respawn on every relog and at least I'll be getting exp and materials too.  And I won't have to fast travel.
---
I also run the glassed caverns daily and, to be honest if I score a full set of sturdy BoS combat armor from Taggerty I'll probably just stop looking. It's not worth the time investment, like most of the rare gear in this game.
---
My base damage on my non explosive bloody combat shotgun is around 550 without all the shotgunner perks. 
---
Yes
---
I joined server, see no nuke zones or peeps in silos.
---
Artillery... cost me nothing... even the smoke grenades are free.
---
Specifically ultracite ammo. The flux cost to craft it is insanely expensive for the amount of rounds you get. I mean, [I've got 10K+ ammo](https://i.imgur.com/vL3SY4B.png) on a lot of things. Regular ammo is fairly easy to get. Ultracite's another beast entirely.
---
I‚Äôve heard the effigy is the rarest of the CAMP plans, so I‚Äôm content with getting that. It‚Äôs a nice little bit of outdoor decoration 
---
Just because they are rare doesnt mean they are glitched
---
Yes, 3 bottles of whiskey is the same effect as 1
---
Haha, I also took a photo when I first discovered it but only just recently decided to move my camp there.
---
If your on xbox I have 3 and can give you one.
---
Its annoying they fucked up the first time limited event. Even advertised with the 5 undroppable masks. ...
---
I guess he gave up? 
---
Great, TSEs are not part of a limited time event that was very highly marketed and anticipated to be an achievable reward.
---
Build, scrap, repeat. 
---
10 people have confirmed got them. They have proven to be glitched. There is a literal 1 in a million chance. Bethesda just isn't listening
---
Sentinel's can be beat if you know what your doing.
---
Honestly sometimes the trade window just straight up disappears without any input whatsoever. Then you try again and 10 seconds later it disappears again. And again. So that might be it. 
---
Can you be more specific about this location? Are you talking about the cabins to the NE or the ski resort directly E?
---
Yeah with the stagger perk i know
---
I was so excited as well. I've hyped it since peoole speculated it in beta and really wanted to sun mask
---
And not just to the player who takes them, other players should hear it too. Can you image fighting the SBQ now?
---
I would love a donut recipe 
---
fairly solid. downside is that you will lose to any optimized, non-power armor build. u lose out on a massive amount of damage mitigation and damage output by using power armor. which is sad bc personally i love power armor in the fallout franchise. 
---
that said, if u dont wish to participate in PVP, then you'll be fine since the pve stuff is face-roll easy after lvl 50. 
---
Unless they changed it,  it's not the last one.  It is a random one.  So you could lose marsupial while trying to drop empath.
---
No problem. I wouldn't mind just helping you out and sending you on your way. I could at least share my perk making it cheaper to craft it, but it's your call. Take care out there. 
---
1 in a million seems rare not glitched. Ur only proof is 10 people have confirmed getting them. Have u asked every single person?
---
So jelly
---
So the tin man does have a heart after all
---
Other ways too. There's more then one way to skin a cat
---
U/ladydevann &amp; u/valseek here's some stats on efforts to find this stuff.
---
I was like finally legit players are getting these but nope dosent look like it.
---
Lol @ title and damnit I'm tired of being pie-less
---
I would also like to be able to put tattoos on my arms.
---
If they advertised it as an event using just those masks, because of the lottery standards, they could be charged unless the prove its a glitch.
---
Fastener pigeon
---
Hi, thanks for the offer though but I'm on PC. &gt;\_&lt;
---
We all know that the only thing worth keeping are the plans and the beret
---
What do the mentats do for you?
---
Does the pie ever get spoiled?
---
3 people have it lol thatsl means it exists. Just imagine how many caps it makes that worth!
---
The main problem I'm having is with the SPECIAL dailies. I can never get the task to register so I just can't complete the daily that day.
---
I played that event for hours trying to get the jester and skull masks but can‚Äôt well that‚Äôs my luck. Phone is almost dead so bye.
---
All I want is the red ant lager. No such luck yet.
---
the Biometric ID card? There is one in the room where you get the sample and one where you create the card. For future refrence.
---
Ive had pacifist mode turned on ever since the game came out. Simply put I dont want to do PvP. Not in a fallout game.
---
If I wanted PvP id go play a game that is a bit more built around it.
---
Its not mandatory its just ideal.
---
The game files and the servers master list doesn't need to be the same. And knowing what's datamined, there is this extra perimeter that's need to be dealt with to even get a chance to roll a rare mask. What if this isn't RNG, knowing Bethesda's dailies you have to complete objectives under certain conditions. 
---
What if it's as simple as eating a fasnacht donut or sausage before the event ends, or other strange stuff.
---
Don't dv when you don't know what you're talking about, there's two, one on ps4 confirmed here. Also if 3 people do have it as you claim, the other two technically don't exist in our ingame market and across it's players. Bud out, trying to talk some sense into them. You're not helping
---
So far I think matching the decorations that exist when he's not there gives the highest score, there's a few other combinations I've noticed too but as only one person hard to be certain. 
---
Whether someone sets fire or not to the bonfire at the end, whether you wear a mask during the whole event or put it on just once in line at the parade start, which mask you wear, what type of steins or eggs given, which order the Marchers arrive (you can reorder Marchers by standing in front of them and they will get delayed and can adjust order). Lots of little variables. 
---
So far I've gotten everything but one of the ultrarare masks, but definitely down to try more combos with people while we still can. 
---
As does holding your breath. Anything that burns AP also burns power cores.
---
You must be new to RNG type of games
---
According to the radio drama holotape it‚Äôs most likely just a hairless bear with extra legs tapped on. 
---
mostly south east (to spawn in the scorched beast queen)
---
I'd like to see every single public event have a legendary creature tagged on to the end as a final boss. Doesn't even need to be 3* every time could be any rating of a legendary creature. But there def needs to be a legendary final boss at the end of every public event. This is another reason they are pretty dull. 
---
So far the AWOL armaments is a pretty high rate of a 3* Col Gutsy. Totally worth the battle with 3 waves of col gutsy. Col Gutsy also drops high level to max level loot. 
---
Faschnacht has the megasloth legendary. I'm pretty sure that one is 3* but usually drops a 1*/2* level 30-35 item. 
---
Some Horde events have legendaries at the end. Super Mutants and Scorched events have been pretty decent. I think I had a good run or two with the Mole Miner horde. But most other horde every are low level gear. 
---
Uranium Fever has 3 legendary, but they are usually level 30-40. I usually go to this one for a potential 3*, even if it's a level 35. 
---
I think I've seen a legendary or two on a census event, but they aren't for sure to show up. 
---
Do y'all know of any other public events with a legendary at the end? 
---
thank you for the info
---
Would have preferred a straw poll :|
---
Don't have a twitter so I'ma sit this one out.
---
Damn ok, just the other two then
---
its a post-apocalyse survival franchise, there have always been raiders and baddies out there to mess you up. in fallout 4 u could build a base and had to defend it from ghouls and raiders etc. the only difference is that now, those raiders are people, and not dumb AI. u answered your own question, "where hey it's survival and anything goes". 
---
most people who play as raiders will come and attack you, maybe break some stuff, see if u fight. then leave. if they go beyond that and constantly pester you...just leave server. 
---
regardless, survival mode servers are out tomorrow so ppl will migrate over and the CAMP whinging will stop.
---
I‚Äôm not end game so I go off of all the high level players and videos. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone really running around a nuke zone without it. Lots and lots with power armor. What‚Äôs a good non power armor end game build? 
---
Had no idea...
---
I just keep smashing the thing in with my grognaks axe until it's HP bar goes away then I turn around and deal with the pests.
---
Yeah we are running out of time, and I still lack some plans so I'll try to make haste. If you only lack the rare mask stop because there is no point, maybe do a last parade as a goodbye before going to sleep.
---
&gt; What Bethesda keeps not mentioning, and I keep trying to hammer home, there are Uncommon (3) and Rare (2) masks, and we aren't seeing either grouping drop.
---
Yeah I really dislike that they haven't stated anything like they are dropping, specially when the event ends in no time. The community pretending that "that's what rare means!" and "that's not the point despite what they said" also didn't help a lot in letting them know.
---
You are so dense. It is a number comparer. It is wrongly set up to compare the second number with 1 not 0. That makes it 1 in 1000000. Not the 1 in 10 it should be.
---
Oddly, this song is insanely popular at German beerfests. Damn near ever single fest I went had this song played by the band, and hundreds/thousands of Germans would all drunkenly sing along despite having no clue what the hell a "mountain mama" was.
---
If your on xbox I can sell you stims
---
No ones buying fo76 its ok.
---
9 times out of 10, the answer to most instances like this is, Bethesda Spaghetti Code^(tm)
---
The asylum and the Whitesprings Bunker. They atrocities committed in the bunker juxtaposed with the grandeur is chilling imo.
---
Just make a camp so pathetic griefers will pity you
---
A player vending machine that persists between characters could facilitate such a transfer. You pop in items, set max caps (so no one buys it), hop on other character and since it's locked to your account you can remove it.
---
I don't know. Just saw an opportunity to plug player vending again and took it. üòÅ
---
I do think a persistent stash would be neat as well.
---
There are terminal entries describing these as storage bunkers for different entities. For instance, TNT Dome 3 &amp; 7 are both Nuka-Cola bunkers. TNT Dome 2 houses alien paraphernalia (e.g., mod for the Alien Blaster, Alien Blaster ammo, etc.). The others have not been made available yet for opening.
---
FO4 has one modest that did an amazing job with long hair style.  Azar I think was his tag.   Miss that so much 
---
I'm sorry to hear that. It's a good website. I was skeptical along time ago and now I enjoy it. Got into it last year.
---
I think I have about 124 ultracite ammo so far in the game, and I‚Äôm level 53,  and I was able to buy a majority of that off of a guy for 50 caps per piece. The rest of the ammo took me at least a few weeks to even get close to making the ammo for myself
---
Why so mad anyways lol, its a cosmetic item with no benefits
---
"I got a bite! It's a big one! I can se......run away! It's a Mirelurk Queen!"
---
This is why I think so many people bought 900 hours guy hook line and sinker.. There are plenty of players that don't even now what prime ammo is or how to get it and assume it's as easy to come by as regular ammo. Hell I was watching a guys live stream who was well over level 200 and he didn't understand the difference between normal ammo and prime ammo. Most people that aren't balls deep in this game don't know much about flux or what you need to do to get it . 
---
There are two domes with secret quests that don‚Äôt show up but you have to follow the keys and clues to find the keys to open them and in each one is the t51b Nuka cola paint plan and the xo1 Nuka Cola Quantum paint plan. So far that‚Äôs all they have I think there might be more later since there are a lot of them in that area. It‚Äôd be nice if this is how they implement a lot of paint plans.
---
Thank you so much!
---
You're be an asshole for not laughing right now.
---
On my first and only run (which happened today), no human or robot casualties, got an owl mask, stims, and caps
---
I've been hyped since early speculation during beta. They advertised using the rare masks mostly. I've wanted the sun mask since the data mine 3 months ago. Clothing fetches money in this game. Some us super hard to get. It's an mmorpg and cosmetics have pride. Etc.
---
Dome 3 has the plans for the Nuka Cola T-51 skin, and Dome 7 has the plans for the Nuka Cola Quantum X-01 skin.
---
I got all of mine within the first month after release. Walking just outside of Camden Park and then back in reset the daily there and activated 1/3 randomly every time. I have no idea what the tokens are worth now, but back when I farmed them they were typically going for 5-10 caps per token. I only heard from one person who did that, and they said it took several days of posts on the trade subs looking for more to get enough for the suit. Whatever fix they implemented to stop it from resetting in that fashion seems to have broken the quest for most people, because you are correct, it was messed up for over a month for most players, and since it's been operating MOSTLY as intended since January you still would need 150 days of repeated dailies to get enough tokens for the suit. It was a brainless, awful grind, but that's how most people got them before the fix.
---
*Skyrim voice* Never should have come(out) here!
---
When I started the game I decided I would play without using VATS. That decision may have cost me damage points but I can live with it. I really don't know how much I do or don't need it. I'm a rifle/shotgun build. I manage pretty well with the perks I have.
---
Whelp, looks like their sale and pre-order numbers have tanked quite alot since they have been doing their own launcher stuff. Hopefully other companies will give in as well such as Epic especially.
---
Yes there needs to be about a 100-200 capacity storage that can be accessed from characters on the account the whole asking your friend on another account to stand there while you hop toons is just bad for everyone. Except my toons. They are happy. 
---
Grognaxe 
---
Thats the thing. Shotguns got nerfed the hardest and don't have range. I'm glad they were nerfed, but a little bit more damage would be nice.
---
Thanks dude!
---
Oh, i see it now. I thought that circle was too much to the south, but it's not.
---
I cant remember off the top of my head but non PA builds tend to revolve around 3* armour, which is why PA is Ideal for endgame since you just jump in and off you go.
---
Yeah only pve for me, thanks for the help though 
---
I understand that but it werent be special if everyone had them. There has to be people willing to part with them. Try the fallout 76 market. Someone may be selling
---
Imagine a missle launcher or fat man with the ammo capacity of a minigun 
---
He said PSN, I think that's pretty specific. üôÇ
---
The original post read "I'm bored and want to help people"
---
The OP has since edited the post to include PSN and his gamertag as per my recommendation

If your on xbox I think I have an extra I can give ya

Forgot about there was another dome for the alien blaster.
---
Confirmed how? I‚Äôve only seen pictures, which are easy to fake.

Didn't realize it had been edited, my mistake. üôÇ
---
Whenever I get a sizeable amount of stuff I don't use, I fast travel to Flatwoods and unload everything at the Red Rocket 
---
A well matched set of armor, preferably with legendary effects, and perks to do more/take less damage alongside mutations is more than enough to get around power armor. I like to use barbarian, evasive, scaly skin, and grounded to make up for not wearing armor with a hazmat suit. Pair blocker, incisor, glowsight, and lone wanderer/strange in numbers on top of that and youll cut through hordes of glowing ghouls. 
---
Plus you can pick a level 3 door and hack a level 3 terminal to skip the silo reactor entirely. 
---
As a solo player, I loved the event. Made some friends and did a lot of trading. People worked together rather than griefing. I‚Äôd prefer that over a mask any day.
---
I literally carry over 10,000 5mm rounds at all times, Heavy Gunner build yo. Ultricite ammo is less likely but is still entirely possible.
---
Dude. Those people can, I don‚Äôt know, not take it? Ugh, chill. 
---
Thanks guys, hopefully there isn't a statute of limitations, I'm going to go back and try and get everyone
---
And lemme guess you were wearing an Old Man Winter mask when it happened
---
It does not
---
Thanks for the offer.  I'm on PC.  I'll probably just have to buy/trade for them later, unless I get lucky.
---
of course he didn't, he's ignoring the obvious because he didn't care about the rare masks.
---
The real problem is people using stealth boys, you can‚Äôt vats target when under the effect, and with marsupial you can be difficult to see.
---
Still, it'd be nice to have a group to KNOW we're helping people. Guess no one is into here though, so whatever. 
---
Yep. I noticed most posting on Twitter and Facebook were acting like this was wasn't a big deal to have that much ammo, and how Bethesda banned "their only fan". No, the dude exploited and got caught, and his story only got passed around because tons of people were in in "lol, 76 sucks" mode.
---
Anybody in the end game knows ultracite is just too damn expensive to even use. You need it in bulk, but you don't get that much ammo for the cost, and it's not realistic for every day fights, so that leaves SBQ. You'd burn all the ammo up in a single fight. It's not even worth using because the moment you run low on that ammo your prime gun is useless.
---
I've had two runs with no robots lost and no mask given, I think I've done about 40/50 events.
---
Try out The Wanderer's frost permadeath. The guys a prodigy at the game.
---
and til mxr did frost. I thought he was just a kinky mod review channel
---
What about the characters that aren't male or female? 
---
Can't Target players in an event
---
Oh man. These issues man what the heck haha..
---
And me.  1 in the bonfire and the rest at the church bell tower.
---
We weren't in an event. We were already killing each other 
---
Then just stick to adventure.
---
so if i want my username to not be my bethesda account i need to make a new one ur saying?
---
What are some examples of random encounters in this game
---
You are missing so many that I could mark. Dozens of them. Maybe when I get home
---
Shotguns are great with the enforcer perk, but don‚Äôt have great range. I‚Äôd assume the most powerful shotgun would be a double barrel with the quad modifier, as that could dish out massive dps.
---
I read around here that the only robot that really need to do the parade is the Mr Handy and he is invincible, so blocking the robots could ne a good way to prevent them getting destroyed.
---
np :)
---
I just give them away. I'm not really into selling though 
---
Looks like I'll finally pick it up when it comes to steam!
---
ive gotten 2 pies so far but i accidentally ate one of them
---
I've got a few friends I routinely play with, in one of the unplanned moments of cooperation, we all wound up preferring guns that use different ammo types, so we regularly swap and trade ammo.
---
I don't use 5.56 or shotguns,  so I trade those rounds for 5mm and fusion cells, etc. And another guy gives me his .45 for 10mm. Amounts usually don't matter, as one typically wants his fellow vault dwellers well armed and well supplied.
---
Server hop. It‚Äôs the fastest and easiest way to find the event. 
---
Probably a bit late on this, but in my last few grinds of the event today, I also had 0 Robot losses in two scenarios where I only got a recipe and no mask. I suspected the game thought it was issuing a mask and simply didn't properly drop, so I'm happy to see I wasn't the only one to come to this conclusion.  
---
Thanks for sharing this and taking the time to collect the data.
---
This makes sense. Besides, if you ‚Äúlevel out‚Äù you could automatically get marked as wanted. This gives you a choice of staying to defend yourself or change to a higher level server. 
---
im hoping that we use the same servers tho, meeting new players might be fun
---
That‚Äôs too bad, lasers could use a helpful bug. Thanks for checking. Never know with this game, lol.
---
Grape mentats is +5 charisma. 
---
Maybe we'll luck out &amp; it'll get coincidentally fixed with tomorrow's patch.
---
I've also noticed that it's taking ages for the annoying Splash Screen thing to appear, like when you pick up a legendary or finish a quest. I turned in a tech document &amp; before it showed my reward it popped up "Two-Shot Handmade" but without an image of the gun. It was a level 15 &amp; I sold it to the Enclave 20 minutes before, wasn't anywhere near my inventory. 
---
Recruitment Blues was stuck at "register with BoS" so I just kept spamming the terminal until it progressed, alright I figured. Then it still got stuck on the final step, the way point marker is in between floor 3 &amp; 4 of Fort Defiance.
---
I had no similar issue with my mains progression of these missions. At this point it just feels like I was lucky haha
---
I had to stop watching after I started noticing he just came here read the three top post of the day and made a video out of them. Also he talks like he has some sort of experience with the game but all his footage is of him in low level areas with shit gear almost like he doesnt even play the game hmmmmm
---
Fear not, lots of hand holding in adventure mode awaits you
---
It‚Äôs an okay weapon, but it‚Äôs not as good as the nailer, a bloodied cultist blade you get from the one violent night event.
---
I only got no mask rewarded once, out of 57 runs. If you care, here is data I collected in an excel sheet.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtN90YthXEB3NOpkNuzLhCcIcq9ZDXsS5qswYROcM9g/edit?usp=sharing
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been waiting for awhile I don‚Äôt think it happening, unless everyone went to a different server
---
Who cares. I did the event at least a hundred times trying myself and didn‚Äôt get any rare masks but life goes on. At least nobody got it lol
---
Yep exactly. If you haven't already redeemed your game code to a certain account, I'd recommend going ahead and making a new one. 
---
I've had similar bugs with the Lever Action before. In my instance, it was 20 rounds for my Lever Action, probably picked up the ammo capacity from my Handmade or something. Basically, I just couldn't reload the Lever Action until it had less than 5 rounds in the chamber, and then it just reloaded back up to 5 as usual.
---
One day only?? That's lame.
---
The running attack is a power attack, anything besides the basic attack counts as a power attack.
---
OK I'll add you tomorrow. Do you have a power armor plan by any chance? 
---
Its not really optional for anyone I encounter.
---
I partially agree...  
---
Having found and reported more than a couple hundred bugs, including many fixes, it's pretty clear a good chunk of what we are looking at is the same as Server side...  
---
Could there be hidden conditions effecting the Uncommon and Rare global keywords allowing a person to get them?  
---
Absolutely...  (And I've tried that, have a couple dozen of both in my inventories, timed eating to the bots terrible sausage jokes)
---
Hell I've tried to talk people into not destroying all the damn decorations and make sure when you get that 'Bot the "fitting" choices are used in the off chance that would effect it...   
---
But considering no clues have been provided by Bethesda since the event started (unless I'm missing something) and if that was the case on limited duration quest, I think the community would cry for blood at this point.  
---
And I do know for a fact (theoretically) it wasn't completing the Dalits before doing the event, have more than a couple Atom nuts who always complete the challenges, who also did an insane number of this event.
---
Any weapon in particular?
---
Add me gofukyurslf326 my crew and I launch a few miles a day we can work as a team to help each other
---
The OP's point is that you don't need to tell someone their base sucks.  
---
Probably a gauss with good legendary effects, or an automatic handmade. 
---
It's less than 20 bucks used on amazon right now.
---
You have some serious skills.  Keep up the good work.  I'm still waiting for them to put in sink in game also, only thing missing from my bathroom.
---
No, but you get it as soon as you complete your armor. If you need it before then, I can build one in your camp. 
---
Wow, well hopefully it gets sorted out. I won‚Äôt have my hopes up though.
---
How about an escalator?
---
I can make them I have a few mods unlocked as well
---
If Rivet City even exists in 2287 onward...main theory I've seen is the *Prydwen* is using the forcibly extracted fusion engine from the Rivet City aircraft carrier, based on dialogue the Sole Survivor has with the airship's captain.
---
You want at least 5 intelligence, but 8 is good if you want to be able to use a 3 cost perk +gunsmith/makeshift warrior. For melee builds/ heavy guns, you need 15 strength. For rifleman builds, you want at least 12 perception. You want to commit to a build at some point, or else enemies will soak up too much damage.
---
It‚Äôs begun. The robo uprising. Can‚Äôt you fools see!!! That‚Äôs what really killed the human npcs!
---
It was a fun event. My last time doing the parade I finally managed to score the sausage recipe. Aside the Fab Five rare masks, I only missed out on a few decorating items. All in all a very fun week. Now it‚Äôs time to find some frog eggs to make the donuts.
---
sweet thanks sounds good. I was getting kind of sick of going into that building each time to work on it. 
---
OP's not gatekeeping anything, just listing things they hate.
---
may i ask what you are using to not use bugs and not need power armor or hazmat suits? 
---
only asking because even having full trapper gear with the legendary effect for more rad resist and even having one of each radaway and radshield. you still get a fair few rads per sec.
---
They're taking the servers down tomorrow for the update at 10 am EST so I would assume that's when Fasnacht ends.
---
What does the trick or treater sell?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I made a post about this the day of the patch because I ran into that limit crazily fast and I totally agree with you. The limit on lights should seriously be much closer to **200** than where it's at right now. The current limit legitimately cripples CAMP-building creativity.
---
Random spawn, chance at costume plans
---
Console?
---
Did that. Still have it in my quest log lol
---
I've always tried to match the decorations...
---
Other oddities tried..
---
-To make sure all the balloons were repaired..
---
-Always lite the bonfire.  
---
-When possible wore a mask (and hundreds and hundreds of people did when I wasn't).   
---
-Usually turn in a minimum of 20 Steins when he pops up (I have a bug report on that) with a record of 67 (mixed total, always ceramic heavy).  
---
-Eaten the food..   
---
-Etc.  
---
Personally having trouble buying into it being as complicated as this in large part because of how prone to failure something that nuanced would be...
---
But all that aside I've watched and talked with hundreds and hundreds of people all trying their own little rituals..  With zero success.  
---
You stated you have all the masks but one UltraRare...  
---
What platform?
---
Which masks?
---
How many events completed?  
---
CHA and Luck?  
---
Proof?  
---
I don't mean to sound accusatory, but there has been a good deal of grieving surrounding this event and the people who exploited into the Devroom and got these masks weeks ago.
---
Were gofukyurslf one through 325 taken?
---
What's your GT? I'll join
---
Shit sorry. Ps4
---
Awesome I‚Äôd be up for that add my psn brettboy2014
---
Mo0kish
---
Actually, quantum mechanics forbid this. 
---
I‚Äôm down, what‚Äôs your psn name.
---
It‚Äôs ok, not anything special. A much better weapon would be a bloodied explosive handmade or 50 cal.
---
I‚Äôm starting a level 1 survival only character personally. I plan to see where that goes.
---
Sweet I'll send you a request now. Please don't mind the edgy username lol
---
Brettboy2014
---
Nice!  
---
Owl mask is one of the (5) Common masks, and it appears hands down the favorite for most.
---
Be there in a few 
---
Just bought the game, glad to know you guys are already working on it! Felt bad having to throw away 18 rockets and 20 mini nukes):
---
Where is this?
---
The reason consumers love Steam so much is due to their lax censorship, user reviews, easy access, and support for indie developers. Among many other things.
---
Maybe if video game companies knew what their customers actually wanted, Steam wouldn't be holding a monopoly on online game stores.
---
I'm looking forward to griefers being able to make each other miserable in survival mode.
---
Ok thank you for letting me know
---
After having seen the message several times... this is my theory too. It‚Äôs creating the legend... 
---
I reckon a lotta the Heavy Weapons need some love in the mod department. Heck the Gatling Gun's spider-sight still ain't fixed and the .50 cal and Mk 19 don't have sights at all.
---
I lure low level players into the cranberry bog
---
2 out of 50 (aka 1/25) is about what most people seem to agree is what an "Uncommon" should drop at... 
---
But At this point, until we have the game files more thoroughly decoded, or Bethesda weights in, it's just that, a Theory...
---
Do you do many enclave event/missions?  P sure I get them from those
---
Exactly!  Not 1 to 1.  More like, breakdown ( 30 ) 10mm ammo to make ( 15 ) 5.56 ammo.
---
I dont see anyone nuke Whitesprings any more. It's always the fissure near Watoga on the servers I join. 
---
I think the duping is still effecting the economy more than ammo ever will. 
---
Oooooooh my time to shine! I‚Äôve been Scribing it up as part of an RP guild and I made this entry a few months ago, hope you like it! [The Snallygasters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GmJtUu5OuKYFF1xQ5h0aJZ0sa1X34YHWXocFjo9hBU) 
---
They don't animate hairstyles, though. They just add physics to them--which I love. I hate preset hair animations. I want back length hair that flows in the damn wind.
---
The issue isn't animation, it's the clipping. They'd have to account for that.
---
It's called "Justice" you filthy Raider. 
---
Second this - this location is possibly the easiest and safest to server hop.
---
I think marathoner only works out of PA. I tested it a while back and it did nothing with PA on. Not sure if this was patched recently though...
---
Explore locations u havent yet
---
There's a hidden multiplier for hazmat and PA. RR in PA is not the same as normal armor. You can't get rid of the rads per second with normal armor. :\
---
The easiest way to run normal armor is to just find a friend with rad sponge. Otherwise just down RadAway with traveling pharmacy. If you don't care about mutations you can stack up RadShield.
---
You have to manage _something_, and the people in this thread just wanted to focus on infinite Hazmat Suits. It's boring.
---
Turns out that was exactly the problem. Thanks! 
---
Like a wildcard slot where you could put any perk regardless of SPECIAL stat? I'd be so down for that.
---
Thanks for sharing the info, the more people that weigh in the more it seems to reinforce the theory.   
---
Oddly for most it seems to be about one in twenty five or so events they don't get a mask in the reward grouping, which is what most would consider the threshold for an "Uncommon" drop..  
---
Know your count by any chance?
---
don't back them or let them back into corners or against things. It stops the stagger. 
---
It's 0.01, poll only has one confirmed and bethesda even said themselves these masks are "very" rare. They are 3 times as rare as the rare outfits.
---
Fair enough. Do you use any kind of "reshade" by any chance? I saw a few posts mentioning/recommending them when looking at posts about things you can change in the ini. There was never any clarification that I could find if that is too far into messing with the game though.
---
1 drop out of 9k runs, not even 0.03? Please leave :)
---
Honestly, I think the base of it is too wide. Otherwise it's amazing.
---
Thank you for the kind words and may you be blessed by the luck of masks.
---
I kinda like the idea of mobile pack brahmin you can put crap you dont want on and there will be a bunch walking around the map so you just go up to it and give/take what you want. Everyone ob the server would be able to do this. It would be a great Idea if it wernt for stability issues. I just miss the traders walking the main roads in fo4 and that feeling if random encounters.
---
Well, there is that one quest in fallout 3 where you hunt down a synthetic 'android' or something like that. 
---
If you‚Äôve still got it it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve been trying for. 
---
Go furious if you want a stealth bonus build. Explosive if you don't 
---
I'm about to join you 
---
Nicely done and thanks for sharing...  
---
Oddly I got more witch masks than anything else!
---
The one "Old Man Winter" you saw, was that a reward gotten in the event or did the person arrive with it?  
---
Asking because so far it seems there has been no verified drops of the Uncommon/Rare masks (especially on PC) and we know the guys and gals who got access to the DevRoom walked away with some of them.
---
Np
---
I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I have locations all over the map and I don‚Äôt really see blank spots...
---
They are in silo now
---
Serendipity procs! You are saved :D 3hours of blood sweat and tears climb wasted! But you‚Äôll do it again because you hate your life :D
---
Wow I solo launched mine at lvl 34
---
You devious sunnavabitch, have an upvote =)
---
At that point it will just be free publicity for the game. The hype train  for this game and upcoming content will probably be long gone by the time it arrives on steam, it'll be forgotten by most people who don't play it.
---
I'm pretty sure that the original Dev room access glitch was available on consoles too, because it had to do with glitching through walls using power armor.
---
I keep one in my inventory as insurance because it weighs so little
---
I've done all of that, the quest just isnt completed yet. Beth is probably going to add more to it.
---
Very good point...  
---
Based on the difficulty of obtaining plans for the first couple months (Which this at least on the surface seems to mirror), either they had trouble getting the drop chances tweaked, or some sadist likes forcing us to grind until we rage quit, can't decide which is more likely. ;)
---
I like to solo and explore. I kind of miss the NPC's and story lines, but it's cool to have a way to play with friends. And the map is huge with lots to explore. 
---
Not exact but I would guess about 30 event completions, give or take a few. All of them have been runs without any robot losses if I recall correctly. 
---
Also, the two that I did not receive a mask at all happened when I initiated the event and did the brunt of the work to prepare. Not sure if that effects things, just thought it was worth to mention now that I think of it.
---
r/punpatrol HERE! PUT THE PUN DOWN VAULT DWELLER!!!
---
Vanguard or bolstering full set my regular armor is better than power armor cause of the perks you can take. But in nuke you need power armor anyone in a radiation suit is just a mad lad
---
Yes, this is where my dilemma is. It's just difficult to decide without being able to see a visual representation of my damage output after firing a few shots of the Furious into something. 
---
That's officially the "oh shit" key
---
As you wander around you‚Äôll see icons that aren‚Äôt filled in on your compass. That‚Äôs to let you know you haven‚Äôt discovered that location. If you go around and climb all the watchtowers you can get many of them to show as a gray icon on the map. Also if you look at the wall maps in the train stations and a few other places, click the pins on the map to add those locations to your map. 
---
I had a glitch once where it put all of my shotgun shells into my shotgun. So I could have shot like 700 rounds without loading. It was pretty fun while it lasted tbh
---
Added Charisma, there are some notes early on that suggested CHA effected the quality and frequency of drops, especially when grouped.  
---
Testing the theory doesn't seem hard, if you have 2 characters of roughly the same level, one max luck and one max CHA, loot the same things for a couple hours, the higher CHA character seems to consistently come out ahead.. M
---
But also just a theory atm 
---
I'm not 100%  sure but I will definitely check when I get on tomorrow. Shoot me a PM with your GT and I will get back to you 
---
I haven't seen a parade in hours. Did it stop already? 
---
*Technically* it was two days. It said "1 day" in the atom shop, but then after a day passed it went down to 23 hours and was up for another day. "1 day" in the atom shop means "1 day 23 hours 59 minutes" if you check it right after an update. 
---
But with that aside, yeah it was still a limited time promotion early on into the game when it had less players and when people didn't quite have the opportunity to earn up thousands upon thousands of atoms, with no info about whether it would be coming back in the future. I managed to snag it in the last few hours only because I played every day at the time and hoarded all my atoms, so I had close to 4000 saved up.
---
Haha except for now after I type that 
---
Great story! I'm at 113 and when I see lower level players in Whitesprings with high level ghouls spawning I utilize my Enforcer perk and cripple em so they can get the XP and loot without being ripped apart by said ghouls. Always trying to give what extra I got on me as well when I'm wandering the wasteland and see some folks new the game out and about.   
---
I think the Fasnacht event was a great thing to get randos comfortable working together as well. I really enjoyed the experience of working together to complete the event and then the sharing that would often occur afterward (ya know, when some show-off with an explosive weapon wasn't wiping everything out before others had a chance to get a shot in).  
---
I'll miss that now that the parade will no longer be a thing, but if you ever see ol' ChiliCheeseJay when on the Xbone you can be assured I'm one of the good guys out there.
---
I always hop on mic and yell (well not literally) ‚ÄúI got a crap ton of this yah want it?‚Äù Even if its something I use but I have a lot a swing it. If they are new I tell em what to pick up when they need that junk item again and remind them that they can respec so if they feel like they messed up they dont gotta start over. But I also try to let people experience the game and its struggles. A little care package here and there but thats about it. The lore is really good so I want them to experience that.
---
Well, you see, uhh, erm... *wipes sweat off eyebrow* radiation!
---
You got random encounter events. My fav is the grave yard. But its an rpg so strip naked and become the vault drunk
---
Which type is the Flatwoods monster encounter?
---
You still on?
---
+karma thanks! 
---
I already knew that but thank you anyways. So I guess there isn‚Äôt really a good endgame. /:
---
What??
---
Yeah. You wanna join? I have a Frischact day event here.
---
I have never had this bug and i've done the quest 30 odd times, killing everything before it closes.
---
It needs it for updates. The launcher supports differential updates which is important for keeping patch sizes low. Console versions don't have this so their patches are much larger.
---
Bloody, furious and instigating melee weapons are all anyone's going to use in this mode. Anyone who can spam jump and sprint while mashing hit automatically wins.
---
they arent listening to us. lol
---
Go to the inland light house, you‚Äôll encounter a large endless supply of level 5-15 multi frog/toad things. 
---
White tux and fasnacht man mask flinging my god roll of a drill around
---
Yeah I‚Äôll msg u
---
I usually leave duplicate (known) plans on the ground by vault 76 ...and whatever else that is weighing me down that would be useful to new players. 
---
You‚Äôd just have to take a look and see if anything peaks your interest
---
Ok
---
I have collected every 2 items in stash box after learned already. Be aware, Confetti Pile is very rare. If you got lucky already. On rare masks list... Nope.
---
It seems like this game isnt for u. U dont grt it
---
stealth commando checking in.
---
personally, i‚Äôd keep the furious one. as i found tse can be inaccurate at times and close quarter combat is a no no
---
I think being able give additional stars to items has always been their idea. But it should have been there since the start. 
---
I could use Fusion cores. What‚Äôs your price?
---
What does the beret look like 
---
I did this once. Then I did it a bunch with a sub 2 pewds sign and left some stims as a thank you.
---
I've had a glitch where the event is going on but it just doesn't show up on the map.
---
hmm. i just got my friend to drop their excavator armor and didn't even touch the quest but scanned myself and got the power armor station plan. i didn't even check if i could build it. maybe i should go check cuz of this lol. 
---
There they're their...
---
I‚Äôm trying to make it a game for me lol. It is just hard for me to play something when there is no blatant goal anymore. I‚Äôm trying to move out of that state of mind but it‚Äôs hard.
---
End game is Home Improvement. Make a pretty CAMP and show it off, destroy it all and make another one. Or take a break until the quest updates hit. The roadmap shows when they'll be coming.

---
Thanks.. 
---
Brutal... If that were the case..,
---
Holy crap that is absolutely brilliant and I'm mad I didn't think of it. 
---
There's plenty of new content on the way. I basically just grind levels, hunt for new weapons and tinker around with my build when I get something interesting and try it out. Also there are always areas you haven't seen yet, I know you have stuff all over the map but there's still unexplored areas... I'm level 170 and I just discovered an area in the Ash Heap I never stumbled across, and I find unmarked locations I had never seen before all the time. Those unmarked locations are great for building interesting camps on as well, if you like building anyway.

Kill super mutants all day long in sumersville. Take the same workshop over and over buy server hopping. Go to White Springs and get up on the wall so you can shoot at the enemies without getting killed. Once you get a really legit weapon go to West Tech and start killing super mutants. Another good spot early in the game is the lumber yard all the way at the top left of the map next to the river. 
---
Cool another post about the same topic that‚Äôs been best to death all week. 
---
This used to be a bug at launch. Somebody at Bethesda really needs to get their QA in gear, this isn't the first time an old issue came back. I recall when they changed some weights in one patch and then the next patch reverted all the weights unintentionally.
---
Be gone thot

Feel free
---
Good idea! I‚Äôm loving everything that we have already got from the roadmap and I can‚Äôt wait for more!
---
Oh, not really a fan of how it looks 
---
I also would like to know where it is
---
Lamer terms the game is what you make it. Some people make shops and sell merch others become raiders and kill. 
---
I guess try your hand with the PvP tomorrow.
---
The servers are down, what is the problem with telling people about it?
---
I can see. Bethseda is now trying to turn the game around, but this level of defence for a company is stupid. 
---
This is how bad you lot became when a YouTuber is being advertised because he made a video, this is how triggered you are that the second he releases a video, there's a topic here to cry.
---
How i could get access to Dev room?
---
Yeah, that would be pretty nice.
---
I've done this event dozens and dozens of times as well. I've never seen this issue happen before. 
---
Thanks for the inspiration!
---
Some half level stairs to go up to half walls would be great.
---
Also make it so stairs don't have to attach to the center. What a waste of space.
---
I got some of those already (:
---
I had the same thing happen...he just wanted some friendly PVP action and didn't know how to initiate it. 
---
Im level 49. Ive been ready to launch a nuke but ive been waiting endlessly until this ‚ÄúDisconected from the server‚Äù crap has stopped. 
---
The real reward were the friends we made along the way, and also the mini-nukes.
---
Depends on what you pair it with. I love how it looks with the western duster a surgical mask and patrolman sunglasses. Makes me look like a menacing wasteland doctor.
---
I will do just that, I hope it‚Äôs not full of one shot one kill crap.
---
Straight jacket, Fasnacht Man mask and tighty whities, stretched out on a bed. Amazing what's funny virtually would be a felony in reality, lol.
---
Awesome 
---
Being cosmetic I don't see the problem with making certain masks so rare only a few people will get them.
---
You can't in theory, any longer, was a exploit patches a little while ago.
---
It might take some work evening out stuff
---
Give me the option to have my character look like a Ghoul, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs 1000 Atoms I just want the option.
---
Funnily enough i only just set my tag to raiders, since my BoS chapter died.
---
That is the only way to get mods. Increased intelligence might increase the chance for a mod to pop out, but I'm not sure about that.
---
Yeah, they should add like a parade or something... And new stuff to craft... And put out some kind of informational chart of all the planned content updates for the next year!
---
BETH pls man
---
Something I noticed recently with last major patch is food placed in your stash doesn‚Äôt seem spoil anymore. I‚Äôm not sure ü§î if it‚Äôs a bug or an intended feature so I‚Äôve kept quiet for fear it might be fixed if it is a bug. 
---
Agreed.
---
I haven‚Äôt been on Reddit all week but it‚Äôs nice to see people are still sarcastic and rude ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Appalachia belongs to the Scorched!
---
I've given items to people countless times. But the best gift IMO is knowledge. So I like to team up with lower levels and show then the ropes, or mid levels and bring them on their first trip to cranberry bog and give them a tour of important places, show them the set spawns for tough enemies and give them tips and tricks.
---
I mean that doesnt change anything.  Also if game companies didnt know what their customers wanted they wouldnt be doing nearly so well.  You shouldnt confuse what a vocal minority on the internet say reality.
---
Drop all meds, junk amd caps before you do
---
Golf outfit + fashionable glasses + beret = fancy!   I'm fancy.
---
Hey could use the 2mm and fusion cores too name your price.
---
Whilst the event was fun and a good way to get the community together, bethesda needs to admit they dropped the ball for putting rare masks drop rate on a TIMED event at such a low percentage they've barely been seen by anyone, especially when those masks were so heavily featured in the advertising for the event. Currently at over 100 runs on XB1 and not even seen one of the masks in game,can add the mask situation to the ever growing list of things bethesda have dropped the ball on.
---
Because justice doesnt sleep. They are off server hoping till they find their next raider to teach a lesson to.
---
How about they add some NPCs and an actual story if it wouldn't be to much trouble.
---
Free lol. Youre paying me in inventory space
---
Free af
---
Oh yea. I forgot about rad sponge. I used to use that like crazy when I had friends playing the game. It worked wonders because I could just run through nuke zones naked.
---
I had someone trying to give me stuff when I was around level 3. Kept following me around as I was doing a mission, trying to get my attention to take their bag. I didn‚Äôt have a mic to respond and didn‚Äôt know about emotes yet so just would run around or away hoping they‚Äôd get the point. In my case I just wanted to learn the game and figure things out at my level without a leg up. So if I was one of those who ran away, no offense! Just didn‚Äôt want to rely on high level gifts at an early stage. 
---
How about they release a complete game next time?
---
Ayy psn noscope_420bird I'll be on tomorrow around 5pst. 
---
My end game has been optimising my build that I screwed up when leveling up my just mashing stats and perks together. I also enjoy doing events, grinding for legendaries, and selling/buying rare loot. I rebuild my base periodically and I thoroughly enjoy being clever with my designs and decoration. I still enjoy doing the queen too. 
---
Maybe one of those things is up your alley? If not, survival is sure to provide some extra challenge for you. Good luck!
---
Yeah, Rivet City security chief Harkness. But Fallout 3 is set 10 years prior to Fallout 4, so while Rivet City did seem like a workable place to resettle escaped Gen3 Synths at one point, there is a possibility that Maxson's move to "restore" the East Coast chapter's glory meant places like Rivet City were stripped of anything viable tech-wise.
---
Dude more than 3 people have it, don't be dumb. Its not like everyone that plays posts anywhere and most of the people who got it probably don't even wear it or realise its rare.
---
Don't be such a grumpy asshole just because things didn't go your way. I agree it should be made a higher drop rate, but don't tell me how to reddit and i won't tell you how to complain like a petulent child.
---
A triple A game publisher publishing a triple A game in this day and age? Crazy idea huh?
---
I personally believe that Danse set up shop in Rivet City some time after 2277 and was already in the Brotherhood of Steel by the time they took the power source for the Prydwen
---
I'm guessing you didnt read my other comment haha, i used to be in the BoS until about an hour ago
---
Insane.
---
*Mothman. 
---
Get it right, jeeze.
---
How do you drop caps lol
---
Just get the "batteries included" perk that lowers energy ammo weight, I carry all my fusion cores on me and I currently have 43 cores so im never low
---
I got the beret my first run and felt the same way, lol
---
The enclave version is not the same as normal plasma gun. They dont even share mods. I don't think scrapping them even unlocks anything. Found this out last week. 
---
My bad. Meant junk. Damn autocorrect lol
---
I‚Äôm conducting more testing, but so far mine and another player‚Äôs results are somewhat similar. Furious stacks up approximately 5-6% per shot, to a cap somewhere between 60 and 70% 
---
Yes, they are rare. As they should be. They were a rare military weapon even before the bombs dropped. 
---
I dunno.. my AAE Gatling plasma seems to work just fine... Though I would always appreciate more buffs in a future update 
---
Longshoreman outfit :)
---
Its in their list of to be implemented.
---
I just learned about this today too! .... I've been playing since beta, smh

 ‚ÄúIn American folklore, the snallygaster is a dragon-like beast said to inhabit Central Maryland, the Washington, DC, metro area, and particularly the Middletown area of Frederick County, Maryland.‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúEarly accounts describe the community being terrorized by a monster called a Schneller Geist, meaning "quick ghost" in German. The earliest incarnations mixed the half-bird features of a siren with the nightmarish features of demons and ghouls. The snallygaster was described as half-reptile, half-bird with a metallic beak lined with razor-sharp teeth, occasionally with octopus-like tentacles. It swoops silently from the sky to pick up and carry off its victims. The earliest stories claim that this monster sucked the blood of its victims. Seven-pointed stars, which reputedly kept the snallygaster at bay, can still be seen painted on local barns.‚Äù
---

And now for another psych fun facts...

Shut it you w\*anker!

Gotta get them caps boy 
---
The robot repeating HALT is a reference to Daggerfall where guards would chase you saying it. They didn't have a limit on how many could say it so you could just hear a bunch of broken HALTS as they talk over each other.
---
There's a random spawn about 50-100 meters north of my CAMP location [here right on the cliff edge](https://youtu.be/J5UqEAv6Mlo?t=205), about 3 times now Ive had the super mutants attacking deathclaws nest spawn, also at the bottom of the cliff ive had a couple of other events spawn so the spawn radius seems quite large
---
No thanks
---
Why not keep them both?   Surely you can drop some cloth or something to make room.
---
Following the thread. Waiting for a reply from Bethesda.
---
I believe there‚Äôs on on the road that leads to point pleasant right near the industrial farm. Just east then go north till you cross a small bridge over a creek. It should be just on that bridge 
---
How did you complete all the quests and only hit level 60?
---
It is rad-x that suppresses mutations. I have a bloodied build so I used a ton of radaway to manage my rads to stay at the 25% hp mark (until I started diluting them which is more precise) and never had any problems with my mutations. I haven't tested rad-x diluted, but I've also been told it doesn't suppress mutations, and it stacks with radshield
---
Wow, they have many synths cuz I‚Äôve killed him so many times!
---
No.
---
I try at least once, every time I see a machine. So far, I've got 3 pieces. I wish they'd put a crane game in FO76, and they could put Atom Shop limited time items and plans, and stuff like the rare Fasnacht masks in it, after the events are over. Give it the same rate of success as the pie machine.
---
&gt; This might not have been a big deal on PC, but it was a huge pain in the ass on Xbox having to swap back and forth and back and forth and back again with console load times.
---
No because that was the point. You weren't meant to farm up a bunch of shit on one toon and transfer an entire build over.
---
&gt; Wouldn't a "perfected" system let you move as many items as you want with no chance of players abusing it for more storage space? BL2's was good, sure, but not "perfect".
---
No, because it was perfect for what they wanted. Did you like it? Who gives a shit, that's not the point.
---
 here ya go: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_random_encounters
---
Good news, when the legendary vendor update comes out you'll be able to do something with that legendary.
---
No, because alts exist and giving a shared stash space essentially means that alts can log off next to a stash and then immediately their inventory is extended stash space.
---
God I fucking love that video. 
---
Once survival mode comes out things will be a lot better.
---
Base building, launching nukes, pvp, messing around with friends, events, trading, and mastering your build are a few i can think of on the top of my head
---
I didn't even get a mask on one occasion. Just plans for the poles
---
Oh. Just things laying there dead. Got me excited for nothing

The first time I met Insult Bot, I was reminded of Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged from the Hitchhikers Guide. Unfortunately Insult Bot died before he could deliver his gift...

I miss 1 shot'ing things with my TSE lever.  It can only hold five bullets but it gave me a ton of fun.  I can still 1 shot while sneaking though but not everything.

Bethesda has a launcher for their measly amount of games, with no access to user reviews and likely heavy moderation on their forums. It ends up as bloatware. It turns off people from their games. This applies to most launchers, even some pathetic attempts at online stores like EA's Origin. If I could get rid of the Bethesda launcher and still have access to F76, I would.
---
Video game companies mostly know what their consumers want in a game, they do not seem to know what they want in an application--a launcher, online store, whatever. They want to skimp out on certain aspects in order to reduce workload or make themselves look better. There are entire teams dedicated to discussing these things, everything is very deliberate.
---
Old Man Longfellow was my favorite and most trusted of companions. We saw much of the Wasteland together.

"Enjoying?" What festival is he at? I'm sure it's not the one in the background

Is this synth propaganda?
---
Dude, this is me, but I just ran past all of the enemies until the last room! Also I looked up the code but everything else was legit!
---
Cloth is future gunpowder :) One of these weapons is getting the axe from my inventory, the fuel for them is not! I'm currently clearing what I can from my inventory, however handmade's are almost 20lbs each and I'm of the philosophy of getting rid of anything that's not currently useful to me. 
---
That‚Äôs not the only thing people are hoarding. They definitely need to keep increasing the stash limit. 
---
Cool video and all,  but I wish they didn‚Äôt skip over the part where you have to defend everyone from the mutated humans holding nuclear bombs 
---
It's probably the most annoying ( putting it lightly ) thing to happen ie getting kicked during a SBQ event.
---
Happens 50% of the time on average - or a game freeze.
---
...try reading the whole page? 
---
Idk lol
---
Interesting.. Thanks for some hard numbers!
---
To clarify, no, I said that I had all the basic masks and plans but none of the ultrarare. (Jester, goblin, death, old man winter) 
---
Junk annnnnnd junk, what a difference lol üòÜ
---
Easy just have our perk cards effect our items in stash and if you remove weight reduction perk cards then your stash will go like 2000/800 and make it were you can't add anything new to your pipboy unless from the stash or store in your stash new items until you rebalance your weight problem again.
---
Thx 
---
I thought they added report player button by now?
---
Don't use them either.  I kept reading them and it didnt count.  It seems you need them in your inventory to make it count
---
Wait... you get paint plans???
---
I assume its not one marked on the map
---
that would be great, I like both ideas but i would much rather sell the ammo
---
Depends. What's your opinion on flinging cows?
---
I'm not saying that is not nice, just that with two little kids I mostly play for little time in the night...
---
What do you mean, you need it in your inventory to count?
---
I can't win. I quit lol
---
I have never encountered this in over 300 hours. Where do they spawn?
---
That would be bisexual, my dude. 
---
you would be correct in that assumption, I found it here:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/BstvtRQ](https://imgur.com/a/BstvtRQ) 
---
Good is subjective though based on perspective, so to you it might be a turd to others it might be a good game.
---
lvl 80 here and I do the same all the time, i know the struggle can be kind off painful sometimes, so I like to help ppl out to start on the right foot. 
---
also dont forget to mark the material you need the most it will help you while looting.
---
This did make me laugh. No more comments from this guy
---
I was wondering if they would put anything there, kinda disappointed when i explored that area
---
I think it‚Äôs absolutely horrid and anyone who does it should be ashamed üòú
---
What the ..this is 100% what I've matched the beret with as well! :P
---
It was pretty easy when i did it because of the explosive gun bug. I think my assault rifle used to do like 200 damage?
---
Adulting: mute, block, move on.
---
Yeah I got a bounty for opening a locked toolchest in a workshop that I know is always locked even if it isn't claimed. People that server hop want that free caps and kill for their atom challenge and too coward to expect you to kill them back.
---
If we just see the mask would be enough to get motivated to keep doing the event  ...  a friend of mine play with 2 console at same time , he got 63 masks in each character ... it means 126 runs  and not even a single mask ... thats ridiculous
---
Nukashine challenge!

It appeared after the last update. It's probably a mistake that it's even visible to us, judging by the purple overlay where the number should be displayed... But it definitely has people intrigued.
---
Photoshot tommorow followed with trying to convince people that the other one is a synth?
---
I played without power armor. Just ran around in the nuke zone with a hazmat suit. I died bunches but mostly did fine. 
---
Guess he means you need them in your pipboy or stash until you collect all to get the atoms.
---
How are you people not being paid to pre-review games for a living?
---
The ability to know if something is good or not, with little actual information and it not being released yet is a talent many people would pay good money for. 
---
i would take one if you still have them, and how in the hell did you get 3, and if you say event how many times you did it?
---
I would‚Äôve assumed tomorrow at 11am EST when everything else resets but they‚Äôre taking servers offline at 10am... so I guess 10am EST. 
---
My exact same experience. Exact same.
---
Yeah. I considered buying atoms to get it cause no way was I going to be able to get enough but decided 20 bux was too much for a paint job (if I had enough atoms it was only 5 bux I woulda done it). I‚Äôm so jealous of those who have it (this event is the first time I‚Äôve seen it in game) and it seems they aren‚Äôt bring it back. But I now keep 1800 atoms I won‚Äôt spend in case it or something else I really like that is one day pops up. 
---
yea on xbox we can at least pull up the recent players and join them is there no way to do that on pc or ps4?
---
he was good and informative, then he jumped on the I hate FO76 bandwagon, and now he starts his videos saying how good the game now is and half way on his video he will change his to how bad and buggy it is.
---
I watching just to laugh my ass off and mess with him on the comments. 
---
I think the real reason they won't fix it, is it cost $ to do patches on console and why would they waste $ for the love of fans. Second they think it will cheapen the less then 1% of the population that got 1 out of the 5 masks, doubt anyone got 2 of the rare masks. Third maybe they are afraid of getting to admit doing more wrong with the game so they are going be stern on their absurd % drop rate.
---
Have no caps
---
I hate that too.. shit's just too heavy. Consider dropping them into suitcases at train stations so people can find them. :)
---
Wish it was more descriptive, smh.
---
I want this more than anything else in the game. Crossing my fingers! I was surprised it wasn‚Äôt included in the Tinkers workbench given that it was something you could do in NV.
---
Thank you Kanye very cool
---
Shiiit I'm level 18 and I need a bag of goodies 75% of my weapons are broken or without ammo
---
his a joke, he seems to look in herer for the most trendy post and just talks about it, his on the hate wagon
---
I never got a legit tse had to buy all mine, also people keeping saying rare, the beret is rare the other 5 masks are ultra rare at least.
---
That explains why so many are participating tonight. Happy trails folks! Let everyone get a shot off on the sloth
---
Probably the same as the elevators you could build in Fallout 4. I do hope they eventually include them, along with other things we could build in that game, like greenhouse walls/roofs. 
---
Never got my pie
---
...
---
Sad panda
---
My hugest issue with playing as myself in games is that I‚Äôm a man with long curly hair, which is almost NEVER an option in character creators for some reason
---
I don't get why so many people are defending this "rare" is fine, they were basically ultra rare; almost like gambling with those odds.
---
Oddly enough, it's been there in the game's files literally since day 1, but has never been added to the Atomic Shop. For the life of me I can't imagine why they keep putting it off even as they release all these new items. 
---
I did the event about 80-100 times. Mostly went as a trader not hunting the masks to desperately. Made about 20k selling stims and junk. If you want to shoot me a GT I can give you one tommorow.
---
That happened to me once in 72 runs.  I gave up on the event, it was and is a cool community addition to the game.  But 1/2 the drops are locked behind a bugged drop system which killed my enthusiasm for it.
---
&gt; because the chest are all the player vault or whatever 
---
What?
---
I think there's a reason the 'unending" Legendaries are not in  76. lol
---
Ah, nice! Thank you!
---
Sad thing is since duping is basically dead we can't just go buy from a duper.
---
I wish you can toss the mini nuke like in the previous fallout games...
---
Hi. I think the one just to the right of Johnson's Acre is gone after the last patch. It was just down a cliff from my camp and I used to race over each log in to see what appeared. All sorts of things - unexploded bombs, crashed vertibots, camps, graves etc. After the last patch, NADA! not a single thing appears there.
---
Yeah make it special were less then 100 have them while the thousands+ will never even see one in the server ever.
---
Sneak perks. Magazines. Chameleon. Stealth boys. 
---
I shot a mailbox accidentally with my 2shot gun and got a 10 cap bounty, Beth pls
---
Not sure .just now getting on. If you're on I got quite a few legendaries too sell cheap.  As they're taking up my weight
---
Definitely lol in 4 I would use my never-ending fat man to rain down unending nuclear hell down on enemies of the Brotherhood
---
That is reddit for ya. Honestly, whats beaten to death is all the people defending oh its rare its better to have it special then to have everyone get the masks. Lol, so its better no one gets it then most people k.

\+100 % Disappointed with the Fashnacht Parade mask drop.  
---
 tonight I¬†have hopped countless servers and attended 23 more parade's. and counting just over 60 I did before tonight. That's a little over 80 parades.¬†¬†  
---
I have dropped a majority of them on the spot.¬†
---
¬†I am SO upset with BGS for NOT paying more attention.   
---
Now it is over!¬†

The rare drop rate is ..¬† 1 in 5000. or 0.00020?¬†

YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME...¬† These odds are NOT acceptable.¬†

NOT HAPPY BETHESDA..¬†

That's a 420 luck you uneducated sloth
---
Weird I been getting recipes, except for those days I don't, and most is just regular alcohol you can buy from vendors. Why would Nukashine be in the recipe list if it was the first we learn tf?????????????
---
I found the NPC data for it but I actually don't see anything that references it. Unless it's been given a different name in these lists that's not immediately obvious but I've seen most of these encounters so I doubt it. There may be another type of random spawn that just drops a random cryptid but I don't see it. I will say, there is a mothman spawn in both the travel and scene nodes.
---
I have had a mothman spawn at my camp but have never had any other spawn there other than the mothman one time. So maybe there is a truly random spawn generator in the game. Again, if there's someone that knows more about this stuff, I could use some guidance.
---
that sounds good, too me. I am sure we can work something out, I will hit you up tomorrow
---
Absolutely! There's tons and tons of notes, terminals,and holotapes to collect.
---
And the exploring is great. Some of my best times were with my buddy and I just randomly wandering while we just talked bullshit. Stumbled upon random little areas, took in the scenery, etc.

Red Ant Lager is nice, unexpirable carry weight, but too bad beers don't last that long compared to food effects; and the only hard part in making it is you need ant meat.
---
But it doesn't work like that, when you find a magazine, it checks off the individual magazine from a list. Not like, you collect them all and it says collect all scouts magazines. It says 8 of 8, or however many.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the power armor station plan you‚Äôre referring to is for that crafting station, not the actual Excavator power armor. 
---
Ah, but you've never heard of the divine fish that can survive anywhere?  None other than the holy mackerel!
---
I got it and you will be better off without it, im saying that because you need cooking oil, and it has to be out there but I have been playing for almst 200 hours and I still yet to see any.

where is the Damn cooking oil?

That is awesome! I‚Äôm gonna try that

That does not help at all

I had the opposite happen to me the first day I played and I stopped playing for awhile. I gave it a second chance and came across several similar players like your story. Hope is hard to find in the wasteland, but it comes when you least expect it.

i have looked all around the kitchen are in Helvetia but never seen it, maybe im always too late but thats my luck.

Nukes break the event. Also, I'm wondering what if we get the rare masks if all bots survive with perfect health. Because everyone is so crazy in oneshotting the sloth that is a passive creature 1 star and not even lvl 50 that they ignore the bots getting attacked by wolves and bugs. Also, sometimes frogs which is rare and the super mutants bullets damage the bots.
---
i got both but it took a while didnt even know they were rear, I guess I can be 2 mad about not getting the old winters man mask I did get the donut and the berret

Many scissors use rivets, not screws.

I was talking about myself. Still can't figure out what OP means. I once thought it meant over powered but now I feel it has multiple meanings. I'm old so be gentle 
---
When yoy hover over it yoy can see the challenges within it 
---
I'm still skeptical that those masks aren't dev room items, or devs themselves saying it exists so they don't have to pay Sony/Microsoft money to add a hotfix for the droprates.
---
I am lv 90 and just learning this???
---
r/woosh
---
I thought they changed wanted system were you have to destroy the object to get wanted to avoid random stray bullets hitting player owned objects?
---
I wish the scientists would hurry...i have some bad memories I'd really like to forget üò≠.
---
Did you just assume it‚Äôs color
---
yes
---
I was referring to nukes anywhere. We nuked white spring 3 times in a week and only got 1 spawn at the golf club. The rest of the time it was just meat piles.
---
As for the bots health, that's a good theory. Haven't really tested it. But usually when we have a smaller group. The bots take little to no damage because we divide into people guarding each bot and at the last stop have people surrounding to handle all that. At a glance I think usually only 1 takes more than a few hp loss on average 
---
Oh well I still think trading doesn't count, because I tried selling the magazines to vendor bots and they don't even show up. Kinda sucks because if that is true then I assume getting all 8 holo tape games is the same.
---
  Ya you are right the drop rate is more like 1 in 5000. or 0.00020?¬† 
---
Yes you're correct on the DR. But I'm assuming the other comment meant whatever would be the energy equivalent of armor piercing 
---
Damn. My friend got it at some point and today I learned it existed and was the only plan I didn‚Äôt have. Did one last run, did not get it. My friend just messaged me an hour ago he got another one for me when I log on. So I feel lucky and apparently he is super lucky. 
---
Preach
---
I don't think I've seen a glowing mothman until now.  
---
He'd make a lovely shower curtain.
---
According to the poll results it's 0.01
---
Ladders!!! 
---
????
---
Thanks all who showed up. Sorry for the wait with the server being full and all another sucessfull hunt.
---
I was joking earlier (: I think op means operator, I‚Äôm not really sure either but I do know it‚Äôs the creator of the post. 
---
Not that I'm aware of -- when you click on people in the list of recent players, you're not given a choice to join them.
---
I would say the quest line while it gives you somthing formal thing to do it is just the tip of the iceberg, after I finished my quest line. I started to discover all places, plans hunting, camp build, paint plans for PA, mods, gear farming, etc. 
---
the options are there you just have to figure out what you want to do next. 
---
I dont think they have yet, otherwise i wouldnt have gotten wanted.
---
You're welcome. I tried to build there and realized I'm not an archetec. I'm a square house by a river kinda gal. 
---
Ah, with white springs its hard to say players could have killed the mobs and when the nuke landed the respawn is on a cd timer. And yeah I never seen all the bots get perfect hp by the end, only time was near the end but like I said everyone to focused on the sloth the mobs started hurting them.
---
ah got you , on the xbox you can pull up their profile and join from there 
---
I really dont want pink hair dudes running around or some other oddly bright colors.
---
There were funny in Singleplayer Games but here.. I dont want to hear the Overseer saying thaz we need to rebuild America and we maybe our last chance and hope and then comes 12 years old kevin with bright pink hear and ask me "Is this a good server?" 
---
Cool, thanks
---
still a garbage weapon or at least the ones I have seen. 
---
I'm all about the vats, rifle build
---
HE is right.. this is not acceptable.. even though is "just a game" or digital mask. The point is BGS gets away with this shit all of the time. 
---
I got wanted for opening a cap stash sad thing is I got 10 caps
---
(Btw 43 is not that old, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself.)
---
I thought that 900 hours guy got unbanned and showed his stats before he got banned again?
---
i think that as well, i think it would be cool for bethesda to realse them in the future with new dlc content. but i have to aggree it is annoying seen that quest not been finish. 
---
YES WE DO! on fo4 i had around 5 different mods downloaded, just for extra hairstyles.
---
Those vaults will serve as end-game raids later this year.
---
Iv seen this to I wonder what it is
---
I'm on Xbox and I experienced the exact same thing zero robots destroyed and yet there was no mask awarded 
---
I had never thought of things the way you did but it does make complete sense 
---
Two words... plasma flamer.
---
So you want a free game?
---
I think I got 1000+ in most ammo and maybe 5k or 9k in .45 ammo, just from hoarding ammo with bandolier and not crafting any except 5mm and .50.
---
It's a very old saying. Meaning basically that you've reached the bottom of the hole you've dug and can dig no further: you've hit "rock" bottom.
---
A lot of other launchers do it so I can't see why not. Even people who bought Metro Exodus before it was taken off the steam platform can still launch, update and download the game from Steam.
---
3* Handmade --&gt; me:   :D!
---
..
---
Level: 25 --&gt; also me:  D:
---
I heard the confetti is. 
---
it involves with switching weapons while reloading, im not sure exactly how it works but Ive had a explosive black powder rifle, and im able to shoot, reload and switch to the gatling very fast and back and my black powder will have around 500 shots. Ive tried with alot of guns but ive only been able to do it on a few.
---
Destroy camps, grief newbs leaving the vault and learn all of the games exploits.
---
Sarc
---
I think 800 is fine, quit being a hoarder.
---
Aren't we all....
---
Heavy here, I can clear a silo in roughly 15 min with any random lvl 45 weapon. Might use half a core unless I'm running my gatling laser.
---
I get the idea of the crit vats builds, but I just enjoy mowing stuff down ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I killed a scorched glowing lvl 45. I‚Äôd like to see a legendary 
---
Also love living in Ash Heap!
---
The dev room never had the old man winter or the sun masks as they were only added with the most recent patch
---
Yeah see this is why I think that it's wrong. So I have every holotape ticked off on the challenge, except Zeta invaders. Then a while later I noticed, I already had Zeta invaders, so I thought maybe I picked it up somewhere rather than finding it, but I later found it and picked it as a magazine object, and it didn't do anything, so that made me think, well maybe I found it during the beta, and it registers that I found it with this character, but challenges weren't working then, so the he recognises that I've found it, but it doesn't transfer over to challenges and finding more doesn't work either.
---
I need to either pick it up or find it, on another character. I will test this tonight. If I transfer 1 of my games to another character, that's never gotten the game. And when they pick it up, it finishes the challenge or doesn't. Then I'll know for sure it does/doesn't work
---
Lmao, seeing every comment getting downvoted 7 times is really cracking me up. Looks like Karma got the asshat, literally.
---
Maybe it only applies to camps and they forgot workshops, since they want workshops to be a big pvp cluster of broken mechanics.
---
Any meat is easy to get for a higher level just go to the sub station outside eating a and server hop and kill ants. But for only a five minute buff I‚Äôd feather have ballistic bock, high voltage hefe, or Nuka cola dark going depending on the build.
---
Not always!
---
I've also seen a guy rub into all nuke silos and steal all the ID cards, because his bass was near whitesprings :P
---
Tried sending a request but it says your settings wont allow it
---
When you see a challenge like that that says 0/3 hover over the text, it has three separate sub challenges on the far left displayed to complete in order to complete that challenge.
---
Also it doesn't show up because it's value is 0. Objects with a value of 0 don't show up in the vendor trade menu, such as junk and disease cure.
---
Like a said it‚Äôs a challenge I‚Äôm assuring you you can‚Äôt break into my camp I‚Äôve drained all my resources and camp space making it inaccessible 
---
I now know that, I have no idea how it took 90 levels, but now I know
---
How about "Carebear Mode" as someone on a thread called an Easy Mode lol. Or call it "Explorer Mode" and let that be the easier combat mode--then many of us could not always be so ANXIOUS about what monster wants to kill us every minute. 
---
You should be able to view their profile and click the report option and you‚Äôll be given a variety of options to report them for.  
---
I once forgot to refresh my web browser, so I punched in last weeks code :P
---
Let me know if you wanna give it a wack 
---
I got that one, but it totally glitches out and flickers like crazy with a weird white texture 
---
Welcome to vault 51. Unlike the other vaults this one doesn't have an interior just a door. 
---
Yeah, definitely an homage to Wowbagger.
---
Wow, that's a great find!  Looks like whoever developed this event really did to the research.  Other than the lack of protections, it's all pretty spot on, down to the decorations and traditions.  Wonder how many people are going to turn up there next year wearing giant paper mache Vault Boy masks...
---
What exactly are you attempting to do? I've been messing around with ini settings for weeks now and have a decent handle on what does what for the most part at least. 
---
This silly argument about weight again. 
---
It's for balance. If weight is supposed to be realistic, a slab of concrete should max your stash weight. 
---
Balance dude. Rifles are just about better than any other category of weapon in the game. 
---
Unless they didn't use them the first time they got them they won't have extras. Once you learn one of those plans you can no longer receive it as a reward. 
---
They are there for every player, otherwise you wouldnt be able to nuke in a 4man squad.
---
You're the best. I would give you + Karma but I don't think we traded anything but compliments lol. Glad to know OP means much more around here lol
---
They are probably pre war policemen or firefighters  i lost most of my friends when the bombs dropped :( 
---
They're just asking to be attacked.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing the same since the new patch...that, and I‚Äôve had a bunch of blue screen crashes as well. 
---
Oh, it's pretty good, I like the view and all that. Although ever since I came here I started coughing more but I'm sure that's because of the little dust in my home.
---
Same thing that happened to me. I let the random I was with choose the location than because somebody already nuked the white springs a about 10 minutes before. About level 63. Haven‚Äôt played the game since that happened in late November. 
---
I think people who are wanted should have their camp show up with a wanted sign that can be destroyed for half the amount of caps than killing the player but only when they grief another camp.
---
Damn I need to sort that out. What's yours?
---
Original zinger right there. OP is top tier. 
---
Its all good. Mine's xX5FDP666Xx (don't laugh at the edge lol)
---
I remembered when something like that happened at my neighbor's house one time.  She got a bat in her bedroom, so my dad went over to help her get it out since her husband was overseas.
---
Long story short, you're going to need a *really* big pillowcase.
---
Its both not ideal nor mandatory. It just the best entry level equipment to use for new characters at max level.
---
If you want a queen tanking build, Blocker and as much Zealots/Sentinel gear you can get. 
---
How does it balance it tho? No ones gonna have more than a couple rifles in their inventory. I just don‚Äôt get the balancing argument. Maybe if someone was complaining why the ammo was more expensive to craft then that would make sense, but I don‚Äôt get how making them heavier balances anything?
---
It's not a bug it's a hack. 
---
Explosive cannot appear on explosive weapons. 
---
happened once on my combat shotty. couldnt reload, but it had the magazine from my quad handmade, so 95 rounds. No complaints from me. didnt have to reload for quite a few server hops. When it fully emptied, it went back to normal. 
---
I cannot even remember the last time I saw a 3* legendary creature. It is way too difficult for me to find gear. I have only ever found like 10 3* Armor or Weapons in my whole play time. Of course only like 2 of them were even viable to use. 
---
There should be a way to guarantee fight 3* enemies with 3* loot dropping. The possibilities of bad loot are so high that we need a way to grind for gear. 
---
Thanks for having me on the team....it was a blast man...looking forward to more...I really appreciated the walk thru in the silo.
---
Sounds good, how much for it? 
---
Drill is in the list of melee items rewatdable from legendary drops. Syringer is also listed under the ranged ones. If they weren't excluded from getting legendary effects they would have them on them
---
This is wonderful! I love that it's so colourful, it's like a 24/7 party. It's great seeing everyone's camps, and how creative they all are, and you gave me an idea for my own (putting the decontamination shower in the bathroom!) 
---
It took me a long time to realize I could bulk junk until endgame with my stash tight for space, you live and learn, happens to all of us.
---
op means original poster
---
Asked my neighbor for sugar. Still waiting.
---
Even radiation can't make a tree talk.
---
Yep. Very important to know. Including the week, most weeks challenges have 2-3 that require you collect/complete a bunch of sub-categories.
---
Example 
---
Challenge- collect materials for camp 0/5.
---
Sub-categories- collect concrete 0/25, collect fertilizer 0/25
---
Or
---
Challenge- Get Smashed 0/3
---
Subcategories- Complete events while intoxicated and using a melee weapon 0/20. Kill giant enemies while drunk 0/15.
---
There a normally more subcategories than the amount needed to complete the challenge so you can choose the 1s you prefer/ are easier for you.
---
the bot never works as intended 
---
Xbox One, but I want it to be cross platform. 
---
Based on exactly that, the running assumption is that this one teleports us into a separate cell (like the interior of buildings/caves) and will be a Raid Vault. 
---
2001: A Space Odyssey
---
Upvoting a billion times (rounding down to one). There's a pathetic selection of stairs, even factoring in that they require two squares of platform to attach to. Give me something wider without railing that has an underside already!
---
You're putting the bar too high for sloths man
---
This. It's not like I'm asking tonbe able to carry 4 rifles and use them all. I have so much ammo my first gun would probably run a few silos without getting close to dry. I'm just looking at the viewpoint of if my gun didn't have big Bertha weight stats, I can carry more ammo, junk, chems, or whatever else without worry.
---
@76falloutboy jokes on you, I only had 30
---
secret quest that you need to have some luck with becuase the keys/plans just spwam one per server, 
---
the nuka quantum took me like 15 try to actually get it. 
---
when I finally got the key i get to dome 7 and one to find the door open and the plans missing after a few server hoops to find the door open with the plans. so thank you to the player the left the door open for someone else to get the plans. 
---
so I got 2 plans for the work off one, and now im paying the favor forward when im on the area I open the door so someone else can have the plans. 
---
thats on xbox one, I can also help you get you the plans or paint you PA either way im down to help. 
---
While it's now going to be year away, the idea of some of us attending while wearing Vault Boy paper mache masks is the greatest idea.  
---
I might have to make that happen.
---
I do the same, 
---
I can agree on more stair selections! I'd settle for the current stairs if they didn't need 3 squares to fit in.
---
Great! Vait till I tell Hitler!
---
I remember that day I found Danse hiding in that bunker in his underwear. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to kill naked Danse. 
---
you can also buy them at the bunker vendor (if i remember correctly) also they are not cheap again if i remember correctly, i think 25k caps
---
Go to google and look up vendor map 
---
i found a corpse with a vault 63 jumpsuit earlier directly outside of the entrance to the dane compound, if you‚Äôre entering from the logging camp behind it. it was next to a tree a few feet from the gate
---
Is this new? As I got duplicate paint plan, pretty sure it was initiate paint. 
---
I'd  try server hopping until vendors reset
---
That's the explanation for the phrase, OP was looking for which challenges it requires.
---
glad you got that God tier drill, 
---
Ohhh so it depends on their faction. Thanks man :)
---
Aren't I just so original?
---
You took time to count it and list it. Even I don't have time for that. Yikes.
---
How is that a woosh?
---
I launched my first last week, level 95, with a friend, because I found the end hard enough. I honestly can't understand you guys who launch it solo before level 50... X) 
---
So your argument is "It didn't happen to me in my small sample size, so it obviously can't be a real bug."
---
It's also worth noting that some vendors show as having zero caps after they have refreshed. Try selling something to them and the available caps will change from 0 back to 200 (minus the cost of what you have just sold them)
---
I felt my chest tighten just by looking at this!! So high!
---
I haven't run into unbreakable PA. It's just very very tough compared to non-PA.
---
Ha
---
Explore
---
Yeah thats my argument, its entirely possible that one person can have a bug and one cant.
---
Yes.  If The Brahmin is killed the fertilizer station is broken.  Repairing it summons a new Brahmin.
---
So, I did the event the other night in a nuked Helvita. We successfully completed the event, with one bot taking heavy damage but not being destroyed. So 5/5 were safe. All I got was the Donut Plan. No mask. No beret. Just donut plan.
---
That sounds a lot like the sorts of gameplay footage I see in a lot of these hater videos: The person playing the game will be doing so in this incredibly amateurish, foolish and haphazard way and dying repeatedly, then play it on a loop while they talk over it in these oozingly venomous ways about the game, so as to give the viewer who has never played the game (their intended audience) the impression that this is the average gameplay experience. 
---
I have a plasma thrower, and it's nuts. Burns through ammo but it's fun as hell to use.
---
I've played with them all and my current settlement is:
---
Vampires Gatling Laser w/ 10% dam when aiming (It's great and cores keep it economical with 1000 rounds w/ power user 3)
---
Furious Gatling Plasma keeps itself contained but i'd take 25% added fire rate. (Had TS and Instigating and Furious is the best balance).
---
Two Shot Gatling Gun, so long as you keep stabilized active it does the job. 123 DAM per shot when controlled is really the best.
---
50 cal is great but ammo is harder to source and craft (No need getting into legendaries as it depends on what you roll)
---
LMG is just spewfest, needs refining before it's even a thing.
---
Minigun is okay, but i went from 2k rounds on a junkies 3* and while it was okay for Damage....it used far too many rounds. DPS was weak, but the fire rate was amazing.
---
Not sure if there were many others but striking the balance for speed/damage with the right Perk and Legendary (Vampires/Bloodied/Furious) is where it's at.
---
Yeah even jumping, using jet pack, power attacking with melee. In short any AP usage drains cores directly
---
I've noticed quite a few people nuking random places the last few days. The strangest one so far being either watoga (damn useless) or tanagra town.  Wont know until you test it I suppose. 
---
So, they're still bugged to not be very useful? I have had no issue with the Gatling Plasma, it reloads one core at a time for 250 shots once done.
---
Vats is good with ammo. I run a lever rifle build and the robots drop more steel and lead than it takes to one shot them.
---
I get heavy is fun, easy and powerful but it's not the most efficient. 
---
You can't even be bothered to finish the quests? Move on to another game. Bye Felicia. 
---
There is literally a perk that lets you destroy camps faster ...
---
Then It must only be the Gastling Laser. What a shame.
---
&gt; But having 10k ammo in 900 hours of play? Not possible without some form of cheating or duplication.
---
In fact, the ban notice he posted specifically cited him for having over 360,000 of these ultracite rounds. That number is absurd enough in and of itself, but becomes even more ludicrous when you consider the fact that for him to have had this many in the space of a single month (which the ban notice also makes clear), he would have had to have *not been using any of this ammo* since obviously if he were actually making use of it, the numbers would never have gotten that high. 
---
Nobody who legitimately farmed the materials for that many of these rounds would then go on not to use them. The enormity of the effort necessary to craft that many would be ridiculous *if you weren't getting any use out of them.* 
---
One in ten! Wow...you need to understand that this is why Bethesda isn‚Äôt listening to you. 10% is not rare. 
---
There are people here claiming that they ran the event 100+ times. By your logic, those people should have at least 10 masks each...does that sound ‚Äúrare‚Äù to you?
---
Bethesda made the drop rate for these masks so low because they know people would just grind all week for them, making them fairly common in the process.
---
I‚Äôm happy that you would need to be extremely lucky to get one, no matter how much you grind. 
---
There needs to be more cool stuff like this in the game, it‚Äôs currently too easy to get the supposedly‚Äúrare‚Äù items that are in the game (Nuka-Cola PA paint jobs, anyone?).
---
I know I‚Äôll get downvoted by people who are more interested in having a cry than they are in having a mature discussion on the topic. It‚Äôs ok though, I‚Äôll be taking a couple more shots at earning an ‚ÄúEXCEEDINGLY RARE ‚Äù item before the festival is over, and then I‚Äôll be looking forward to the next fun event!
---
Huh? am I the only one that doesn't get it? The insult bot just stares me down each time. Interacting does nothing but him saying: "Hey, you!" "Wait up." "Commencing Insult on target." And I stand there 5-10 Minutes and nothing.  
---
Do you really get something else from him?
---
I know that a huge amount of the game's areas are based on, and modelled directly after, real life things... but I'll be honest, nothing adequately prepared me for seeing a real life Helvetia that looks functionally identical to the one in-game. That is really, really cool. Thank you for sharing this!
---
Quite a shame indeed. I like that weapon from Fo4.
---
No problem üëç
---
&gt;Even people who bought Metro Exodus before it was taken off the steam platform can still launch, update and download the game from Steam.
---
Because they bought it on Steam. I can still download the most recent Deadpool video game despite it being removed from sale in ~2016.
---
TIL that just because you live in the D.C, Maryland, Virginia area doesn't mean you know about the weird urban legends and myths, thanks for the knowledge.
---
I usually see it in kitchens.  I haven‚Äôt been to Morgantown HS in awhile, but that would be one of the first spots I‚Äôd check. 
---
the should keep it the way it is, but the only suggestion is to get away with the raw material weight. and for consoles save the raw material info in the client side off things, PC would be a little harder do to the fact that is easier to edit a file. but for consoles I think it would help, eliminating the extra weight in the stash and also eliminating the need for the server to track the raw material. its a win win senario. I am not a game programmer but I think that should be do able. 
---
I was joking, as I don't actually care if he's gay or not, but apparently nobody realized. I do accept that he is not romanceable though lol I didn't realize that part. 
---
I use Power User and brought some Cores and Farmed them through Powerplant Fusion Core Generators and ended up with 73 so no problem there at all.
---
Maybe they should actually make the game much better then? If no man's sky can get to a point that it is positive on steam any game should be able to if they actually try. It doesn't look like that is going to happen any time soon if ever though, they are very slowly adding very small amounts of content while ignoring the most major problems with the game. I mean we still don't have text chat lmao. Still not a single hint of any real end game, unless anyone thinks these new vaults are going to be anything more than an hour long distraction.
---
It's nice. Keep up the good work. Just so you know us C.A.M.P. builders live showing each other or work. We also love sharing our knowledge to learn the little tricks to make it nice. Never be afraid to ask.
---
Why nuke boring places? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hard to get keycards.
---
Would love this, my guy is a junkie through and through lol 
---
Seems like such a trivial thing of little importance or impact. But I hear ya, it‚Äôs annoying reflecting on the lackluster, the price and damn, the snapping.
---
I disagree with lights needing to be brighter. A lot of them are *too* bright, if you ask me, like the table lamps. It depends entirely on the specific lights you choose, and I'd honestly prefer that a lot of lights would get toned down a bit so they didn't make everything glaringly bright. I suppose it's all just a matter of taste, so ultimately the lights staying at their current brightness would probably be best for everyone. Other than that, I agree with you about the neon lights. They need to adjust budget restrictions to account for those.

You bet it is. Pvp servers go live tomorrow. Prep your bootyhole though because the high end pvp scene is pretty unbalanced.
---
There's a free slice that spawns on the West Tek facility roof, look for the lawn chair up there. No Port-a-Diner required.
---
I found a two shot plasma rifle the other day but that's probably the only one I've come across in my adventuring.
---
Servers down from 10am EDT (2pm GMT for us Brits), so I imagine then. Should be booting back up with the new survival mode.
---
When Appalachia is secretly run by Skynet, closing us off from the rest of the world  and we're all guinea pigs in their post apocalyptic experiment.
---
Great looking camp!
---
Id really expect someone to actually do some research before saying so much about a game.
---
Because 
---
* They have been making the game better
---
* Vaults are the equivalent of raids for the ENDGAME
---
I don't see how you can say no man's sky redeemed itself completely and improved whilst also acting like fallout 76 can't ever get better when it already has been. We've got 3 "seasons" of content to span the year and comparing even the current game to launch shows very clear changes to performance and gameplay.
---
I really don't think you even know what you're talking about. You clearly know about the vaults, so you must've read the roadmap they released and use that as the entire basis to your comments.
---
Well that takes all the fun out the the random number generator :)
---
that's why I posted a video so people would believe
---
no it doesn't
---
Wood armor is an underated gem. For a stealth build you can't get more stealthy then a shrouded wood set.
---
Yeah its pretty cool its got that same white line in the condition like the garb. I dont really use PA tho but atleast its there. 
---
Lmk if you wanna sell that Furious one 
---
Hit it.
---
Bethesda plz implement a weapon and armor lock function so you can‚Äôt accidentally drop your armor or weapons.
---
 I accidentally dropped my lvl 5 , seriously expensive -TSE shotty I had just traded for and was using to level up my new character fast ,it  fell into an infinite spinning bag which I was never able to retrieve it from and then of course my game crashed ! bye bye gun , all the caps I had just spent that morning and F me !!! It‚Äôs never happened before but the first time it did I took a giant L !!!
---
So please Bethesda make dropping legendary weapons or power armor a little more complicated than just hitting x!!! 
---
P.s. 
---
plz allow us to be able to label our  power armors in our stash inventory so we don‚Äôt have to keep taking them all out to get to one for Christ sake !
---
And by the way the armor duplication glitch is still happening I took my excavator PA out of my stash returned it and now I have 3 of them !! Not really complaining about that one but still letting you know I‚Äôm not duping it‚Äôs your glitchy ass game not me!!! 
---
Just about every mutant thing in the game can be traced back to FEV in one sense or another. While super-mutants are the most notorious example of the virus's effects, all the giant animals and even ghouls (arguably) are other sufferers of its effects. 
---
We're gonna need a montage!
---
I saw people with lvl 300, I wonder what they ae up too XD
---
You probably only think you‚Äôve done it all, have you discovered all the locations? Have you tired PvPing (you‚Äôd get wrecked)? Have you built a CAMP that you like? Have you done the events around the map and experienced the different aspects of gameplay? Have you filled your stash up and struggled to make more room? All while farming loot to repair weapons, make ammo and run the power plants to replenish your fusion cores? Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôve done it all with this post and that your only level 60. Cut me a break either figure out how to play or don‚Äôt play I don‚Äôt care, just don‚Äôt whine about it on the reddit like your the Vault Dwelling Jesus with nothing to do
---
Nice. You should put some Vault Boys/Girls by the barricades standing watch.
---
I nuked West Tek a few weeks ago on Xbox. I wasn't impressed with it until I ran into a 3\* legendary suicider outside West Tek and multiple legendary super mutants inside.
---
True story, though: Whitesprings is boring.
---
Well we want to be a little sassy don‚Äôt we?
---
Not to mention the fact that the only colour option for the lights is blue. Like really? Almost 10K caps and they don‚Äôt snap together, take up a shit load of your budget, and they only have one colour option? I was so disappointed. 
---
It was more for the other who wanted it in the replies here, you got yours and you should be proud.
---
I would assume the original ToS said that they reserve the right to change them
---
Also, you don't necessarily have to do the quest. Spawn in, run to the dome, and sometimes it's open and you can just grab the plans (if they're there).
---
Plenty of mods involve executing third-party code. That would definitely fall under this
---
Visual bug. Sell something to them and it will show the correct ammount of caps
---
man, you must have a huge pp
---
the biggest pp there is, op
---
Do you what is taking much space in my stash currently? Screws. I think i have around 800. But i have a pretty big amount of plastic and silver, among other things.
---
Lol. I just put one in with all the aid. In the waste there are lots of nice people. But you have the occasional WTF experience. I'd like to think I'm giving them the wasteland in a doggie bag.

I actually planned on farming the crap out of it, so I leveled up a stand-by character, and made a third also specifically to do the daily multiple times. I'd recommend it, because sometimes the recipes given are less than ideal, hehe.
---
I find that incredibly hard to believe unless you just tunnel-visioned, didn't explore, didn't pick anything up, didn't build a CAMP, etc. and if that's the case, then I wouldn't consider you as having "completed" the game, or even made a dent in what it's got to offer. I'm level 59 with over 120 hours played, and I've made very little progress through the main questline, never mind all the side stuff. I haven't been avoiding it, I just keep finding other things to do.
---
There are banks in Morgantown. Give each account a small 100lb shared stash. I can see the lines now. 
---
I can only dream.
---
Well to be fair the survival mode they are dropping *is* labeled a beta...not that that helps anything :/
---
Program, application, script. It‚Äôs not as broad as ‚Äúcode‚Äù. And considering there is no FO76 script extender yet, and no mods relying on that script extender, there is nothing falling under anything. The language is targeted at malicious 3rd party stuff like what‚Äôs mentioned in the text: aim bots, hacks, things which will lag your connection on purpose etc. 
---
Out of 9000 + people polled, 3 said they had a rare mask and only 1 provided actual proof. Wouldn't call that numerous.
---
Juicehead is interesting. I genuinely feel that he doesn't like the game (or should I say) didn't like this game because of the myriad of problems it had. Although during a recent livestream 
---
 it seemed as if he was actually having fun.  He even made a cameo in a recent livestream with Oxhorn.
---
I'll admit he seems to prefer to report the more negative things about the game than the positive but even with that said you guys gotta understand that bashing games is extremely popular on YouTube with Fallout 76 and Anthem being the targets of some not entirely undeserved criticism.
---
 At the end of the day regardless of whether you like the guy or not he has to continue to create content. That's sort of his job.  So if you really don't like him or his content there's  tons of other  channel's you can watch instead. Oxhorn, Fudgemuppet, Epic Nate, Rifle gaming, eNtaK, Widgeon Tv, Ranger Dave, Polarbear Igloo, heck you could even watch my channel. &lt;_&lt;

***Insert prequel palpatine here.***
---
Thanks for posting this. There are some workarounds to make letters line up better, but they're really finicky. Moving your camp will mess up letters previously placed and one may start over.
---
To me, the building system is the most frustrating aspect of the game. Even more so, when one considers how long it's been around.
---
Also, the barn building set is beautiful BUT it has no undamaged window included. The fusion generator is quite and powerful, but who thought it would be a great idea too make them wider than one foundation.
---
The game and especially the building system is a constant thrill, followed by a kick in the nuts.
---
... A nixie clock! Free too! - Does not show time.
---
... Just got the plans for an oven / ice box! - deco only. 
---
... Build a house and move it - item is floating, grass is considered water in some spots or item is clipping an existing object, but there's nothing there.
---
Continuously my rant is not going to change. things, but the list goes on and on...
---
Instigating is pretty bad for PvP, most people have at least a little rads and so the instigating effect is useless. I think a lot of people will be using Anti-Armor as well. Also I think ranged builds will have a more even playing field as long as they see a melee player from a distance, it‚Äôll be better than the way it is now anyways with every fight taking place within 10 meters.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs plenty powerful right now, but I definitely would not complain if they allowed us to convert it to .50 or .45. It‚Äôs a luxury gun right now because you can‚Äôt produce enough .308 to feed it.
---
All out at the moment
---
For real. I hate that shit.
---
In Fallout 4 you could snap stairs to the left or right and cover the gap with a half-floor piece. Now you can only place it in the center and have an awkward gap on both sides of the staircase.
---
Dam now the have learn to come out the water,beware the scorched haddock queen.
---
Like others have said, it's pretty good for lone wanderer like us. There is even a perk called just that. It give a fair amount of damage resist when alone.
---
One trouble i had trying to folow quests on my first guy, i was always encoutering high level monsters just because some high level player was last in the area, often even long after he was gone. So i began using server hop until i load into one where monsters had a more decent level.
---
I really hope the game doesn't separate players
---
Thought this doing the parade the other day, all the female characters had the same elegant hairstyle in different colours.

I did not see any. I will keep my eyes peeled for you

---
I like you. 
---
Had my lever with all my ammo 500 plus no reload last patch.
---
I started the game during BETA when nobody had anything. I am glad nobody gave me free stuff because that would have stolen the joy of scavenging, exploring and learning about stuff by my own.
---
Funny how you seem to know so much about the vaults and exactly what they are, got a link for that? 
---
our group of 4 players have done the parade at least 50 times each, lets just say, 250 total events with NO uncommon or rare items.
---
i personally quit the event 2 days ago, as i have all the common items, and NOT going to waste my time on hoping i get a UC or rare item.
---
in addition, a data miner went in and proved it is almost impossible to get a rare item.  i agree 100% with OP.  the casual player WILL NOT get a rare item, and us hard core players, well......i think we wasted a LOT of time.
---
no biggie to me, as my friends played the event, and got nothing out of the ordinary, again, i got a 3 star explosive shotgun in another event.
---

How is Morgantown as a nuke site? Feel like it has enough ghouls and maybe flora while also trolling low levels doing main quest.
---
How about you go back to your Fortnite reddit and cry yourself to sleep. If you're just going to bitch then get off this subreddit. Maybe try constructive criticism next time.
---
Jk Rowling is that you? 
---
Having seen the "cooler" in the Fasnacht event, where you drop off intestines, I fully expect craftable coolers to be introduced at some point in the near future which we can use for this purpose. The fact that we can put items in our fermenter which is linked to our stash but which age differently than other items in the stash suggests to me that Bethesda could do the same thing here, and probably intends to. They've been pretty good lately about implementing good ideas that players have been asking for. 
---
He wants to be able to steal from other players' stashes. Which is stupid.
---
&gt;People would farm the queen
---
I'm sorry? I don't see a problem there. 
---
There is a random spawn slightly northeast of the "Abandoned Mine Site Kittery", if my memory serves me right, between the Kittery and the road. That is also where a alone cat can sometimes spawn, and yes, it is tamable. Don't have a screenshot with the location right now, but should be easy to find the spawn. Just northeast down the hill from the Kittery.
---
What‚Äôs this slap damage everyone keeps talking about?

How do you think the perk loadout manager works? That's a script.

All beathesda needed to do was take out the caps when they did this and then then wouldn't profit from it in the start.

I just don't like people that do good and brag about it. I also dislike videos on youtube that rich people make while they offer some homeless guy a sandwich. Gifting stuff should come from the heart and shouldn't need bragging

Terrible.
---
Good on you mate,gave a lvl 45 a good pump action shotgun I got in watoga feels good to help out.
---
How about something like a reward system?  
---
Let's just say something like that in camp McFlintlock there's a donation/ Warbonds stand that once fueled the American-chinese war.  
---
You donate Old-War money and ammo, and get warbonds in return. Then you can exchange those for army-related items. Like in low-tier you can get a few new army-based underarmours like pristine army fatigues, sergeant fatigues, colonel uniforms, etc. ANd as you go up you get perhaps rare items or even uniques (A powerful M1 garand rifle, for example. Or other decommissioned old timey weapons/ armours/emotes.)
---
Yeah but obviously Bethesda acknowledges that it‚Äôs not something they want, hence the -50% damage done to players for 4 hours debuff if you can‚Äôt cover your bounty/death. Unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt apply to teammates aswell which was an oversight by Bethesda. I‚Äôve submitted a ticket about this and it does seem like they‚Äôre working on a better solution for zero cap PvP exploiting. 
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Awesome! I am definitely doing something wrong here. I‚Äôm 140 odd hours in and only level 38 :/
---
Game crashed when I made my first run at a nuke, and considering all the resources I bled through getting to where I was before the crash, I never attempted it again.
---
Yeah I've noted this problem before, the Ammo in your Gatling Plasma/laser is equal to the amount of cores in your inventory when you equip it. 
---
It's a bizzare bug that only happens with those two weapons. 
---
This never happened in Fallout 4 with Gatling Lasers though so I'm really not sure what's going on? 
---
Could it be something to do with overcharged cores (when crafting with Ammosmith)? Because Gatling Plasmas and Lasers don't have a fixed Ammo capacity anymore. Who even knows?
---
You're not paying attention.
---
They need a decent flat top, I made a Terminator character but it‚Äôs hard to get his hair right 
---
Its the phenomenon where if you attack a player who isn't hostile to you, you deal reduced damage. The term "slap damage" was coined because Todd Howard compared the system to "going up and slapping someone in a bar." The problem with the system is with the right gear and weapons you can completely bypass the "slap damage" system and insta-kill people. This is getting removed tommorow so both sides have to attack before ANY damage is dealt.
---
Sometimes it helps being on a team or even forming it. Doesn't  have to be with friends, it could be with like-minded persons wanting to fight the queen. I've done it several times with different people and it really comes in handy when you get disconnected as you can just join back up with the team.
---
I believe they said 6 am EDT. Then the servers are going down around 10 am EDT to patch in the survival beta i guess.
---
Source? 
---
You could launch nukes at random locations and see what happens
---
If you're correct about what in the world he's trying to say, then I agree with you. 
---
Yeah you‚Äôre literally lying rn. There has been many test that you cannot one hit anyone with slap damage. You don‚Äôt know how the game mechanics work. Stop lying on reddit and seeking attention 
---
I also feel ALOT of people miss the fact that they are calling it a survival mode BETA.
---
It's maybe not as high, but i felt the same walking on the monorail :

So now I just use camera mode to set up for a picture - then I take a snapshot using the console itself.

If it's something I deem worthy, I'll take it in-game for the loading screen.

Are they going to do anything about this two shot handmade explosions of death meta I‚Äôm seeing everyone use or? 
---
Thanks for fuelling the fire of cringy fallout 76 fans.
---
Sure, if you think ten pairs of scissors can fulfill the realistic requirements for a fusion generator. We can't have everything.
---
Because they can have their camp near Flatwoods and we can't nuke there i think.
---
I don't waste one second of my time on the hate bait for clicks YouTube brigade.

Did you pick one up

I don't think i have the plan, but i have 3 beret in my stash.

Looks like free masks to me

Can you find me some people who have been banned for running PLM and the reason being a TOS violation?
---
Radium rifle mods take forever, I don‚Äôt have any experience with your perceived ‚Äúbug‚Äù tho
---
They literally said they're high level end game content.
---
There is absolutely a screw up in the code. Bethesda said it's all correct, but clearly it is not. If the drop rates were intended to be non existent then that's just bad design. I think they fucked up and didn't feel like fixing it because they have a deadline for PvP and player vending
---
Do you have 2x Acrobat armor?  
---
I have 2 pieces, but I have yet to really test it out.
---
And you're fuelling the fire of cringy Fortnite kids. Piss off you little keyboard warrior 
---
The event was a good way to get a server to interact. The cosmetics and camp plans were cool.
---
That being said it was boring due to the low event level and the prevalence of high level players running for masks. Worse, you effectively could not get half of the masks due to a total failure of judgement,  or a glitch. The event itself was also very prone to griefing, from power armor droppers to car kills on the bots, and being able to nuke the parade and wipe the event out. The legendary megasloth at the end basically always glitched in place to become unlootable, exposing a major problem with the tagging system and ‚Äòboss monsters‚Äô. The hourly run time meant server hopping was common, and I felt like stability was reduced. Event load times could take up to 5 minutes for bots and other fascinating related items to pop in for me.
---
What the...
---
My TSE Handmade only deals a maximum of 412 damage while my Bloodied Handmade can deal up to 530. Not sure why people cry about tse anymore
---
Is this at Helvetia?
---
Yes.   All the Fallout 76 Youtubers just read all the content from reddit posters and regurgitate those in videos will a bunch of opinionated fluff thrown in to exaggerate the video and lengthen it to get more ads for the money.
---
Heck there was even 1 youtuber who made a video about reddit users posting about youtubers.   Kinda sad that many of these guys really cannot produce any content on their own.
---
Is this how beth compensate for the no mask drop? Lol
---
Nope. 
---
He spends hours complaining and making videos about a game he doesn't even play. 
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Yes, you may fall through the game world like I did when I had mods installed after the last patch, but you won't lose anything.
---
That's sad.

I fell through the world and died and then couldn't pick up my bag (it was under the ground).

I am over level 200 and have the same stuff as you do. And people cry about others being higher level.....
---
I'd honestly rather play it on Steam.. I mean it kind of sucks this is happening now, but it's so much easier to make friendships and establish communities in games through steam as opposed to Bethesda's weak client and community resources. It will be interesting to see which platform will have the most active players.. majority of the people who will play the steam version will likely be playing it for their first time.  I predict a steam launch price around $30 with steam sales as low as $15-$20 and Tricentennial being a form of payable DLC at $5. 
---
Honestly I wish they would stop selling Tricentennial as it should have been something rare and reserved for players who got the game on launch.
---
Yes. You mean the little square to the left of an item name?
---
Keep in mind workshops still trigger pvp so will shooting people back outside of pacifist mode. 
---
Pouring one ou t for tge homie...hic
---
this is getting dropped on every whiny "rare masks dont drop" post i see from here in.   
---
TY kindly
---
Did someone hacked into console on PC?  When you drop mask it is in paper bag. This is not legal!
---
after great deliberation, yes.  now watch me get banned for owning a dupe.
---
Fireman poles!!!
---
...ammo and mod. The blaster is in a different spot. 
---
yup.  happened just as the event was ending.
---
Just to add to this, I was blowing through cores like nothing when I was doing the Heart Of the Mire event.   I then started paying attention to what I was doing and I noticed heavy drains on the cores when doing the power hits.  Like bad drain.    So dont power-hit while in PA.
---
I have a bloodied rifle build and that works well enough. You just have to learn the mechanics of how you can make crouched players acquirable by VATS. But then again, crouched players can't have sentinel active, so that's an additional vulnerability.
---
I also have a full health melee build (which is quite rare in PvP) that's also a crit build (again, rare for melee), and I clean up pretty well. It's also worth noting that while melee has no stagger perks, twisted muscles does cripple on hit and every cripple is a stagger - but most negate that through adamantium skeleton. 
---
The big issue for both is players using stealth boys. With assassin+sentinel+stealth boys you just have to make it so they have to pursue you since they'll be vulnerable during pursuit. The draw back is that's predominant with people that have range, like rifles, shotguns, and sometimes heavy weapons. With assassin+cavalier+stealth boys, they're most likely melee but maybe shotguns as well. With melee, the advantage is to get them on approach. Without unyielding gear they probably have 6-7 perception at most, but more than like just 1, so they'll never see your red dot on the map if you're crouched. Hunt them at range and catch them when they're not sprinting. Shotguns they probably have 10-11 perception, so you can't sneak to them. But they can't sprint and shoot, so you need to catch them in a sprint at range where their shots can't do enough damage to kill you. Again, hunt at range, but either draw safe standoff distance fire or wait until they're not sprinting. For either case, you're leaning on your perception to draw the red dot on the compass, leaning on perception for their marker arrow, or trying to force them to waste stealth boys with a long drawn out engagement. Even if they get a kill in on you, they probably waste 300 caps worth of stealth boys to earn it. You might not earn caps in those engagements, but they certainly lose them and will probably consider ditching the fight, accepting the vulnerability from not having stealth boys, or flat out squander their resources for the win. For both of these you probably want to juice out berry mentats or mark them with a recon scope to make tracking easier. These are all tactics as a bloodied build, but unbloodied there's still plenty of mechanics in the game to drop them.
---
I got beret after 50tries, it took so long to get it from another player, because it wont ever drop for me! But i have beautiful [Camp](https://youtu.be/hP6j-mwslpk?t=149) now, so i am happy. 
---
The thing is this is the mask from the atomic shop. You can‚Äôt drop those items 
---
What happened to your channel man
---
Still the cores weight 0.3 lbs each with that, and you are carrying 43, so thats a total of 12.9 lbs.
---
I would say thats a bit excessive, but considering the recent patches that made cores spawn at 25%, I don't blame you.   I don't disagree with the 25%, but if they want to do that, give the PA users a way to transfer energy to from 1 core to another so you can manage them better.
---
You can't kill thru slap damage. Did you own workshop or something? 
---
hilarious!!  +1
---
I noticed yesterday when climbing a lookout tower that they had a metal rail that bridged that gap between the stairs. Why can't we at least have one of those for our camp since they are already in the game?
---
Can't think of some other way to say 'berry mentats' like everyone else, so I'll say it was Sheepsquatch.
---
you noticed that too.
---
TSE is basicly crap imo, and in vats, since its 2 bullets flying paralell to eachother and not behind or rly close side by side, you often miss 1 or both bullets, Antiarmor is the New meta, and explosive ontop of that is just a little dmg buff now, and in pvp it wont be that good thanks to fireproof cards and assasin armor. So crying about TSE is like... dude, its shit now ü§£
---
Yep there is no way to bypass it, unless you start PvP other way, like claiming workshop for example.
---
I remember seeing a clean metal staircase looking item in some data miners post. Been waiting for it in the shop for months...
---
Good for you, man. :) 
---
And thanks for letting me know about the Mire Events.
---
Unfortunately, i don't know when i will be able to test it out for myself since i haven't touched the game in months as there wasn't much left for me to do (although i plan to get back to it once Bethesda has added more content).
---
This is my friend and she‚Äôs frickin‚Äô awesome! She has an Instagram page with lots of pictures as Danse, she‚Äôs also an incredibly talented cosplayer. Go show her some love on the gram - @honour_and_steel ‚ù§Ô∏è

That gave me chills ! It's been years since i last heard the song.
---
Biggest firepower in history of humans.
---
My Gauss rifle can make up to 1300 dmg. Base damage is about 200.
---
It depends very much on how close the actual damage is to the maximum. And there is probably TSE closer than many other things
---
Did you happen to own a workshop? When they changed how workshop work a few updates ago, allowing capturing from anywhere inside, i've moslty stoped capturing them.
---
I've done it a few times for atoms and almost hopped server right away. To me they made it clear that workshop are a PvP thing and players should stop using them for ressources and plans like i had been doing.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are trying to lie about this shit. Like what do they gain other than trying to nerf a build because they died in a fight they couldn‚Äôt win 
---
I did event so many times i got 2600caps just from rewards on end of each. Now who is better businessman?

Nope. It means your doing something right actually.

Keep doing what your doing, enjoy it!

The bombs fell around Halloween, so this makes sense.
---
I just added the Launcher to steam as a non-steam game, everything else works fine.  
---
Wait you do that after it‚Äôs over? I used my Twoshot as it started....
---
So glowing and scorched have same eye color? Cause i killed scorched and he had green eyes, but more pink "scorched" flesh.
---
Or just add the launcher to Steam as Non-Steam game? Works fine.
---
but they had it before launch. If the game added it after lauch it would mean the game would have to be re rated. Why risk that? 
---
Same score regardless of choices.
---
I think so, I've never seen a Scorched Mothman, so I wouldn't know.
---
I added the launcher to Steam instead so it would patch the game when needed.
---
If you add the EXE then sometimes you get error because your client needs patching.
---
Who cares, just kill him again and eat his corpse. Thats what rose learned us, not to solve political problems.
---
Same. Sometimes I just try to roll with it, but that usually means I look like an idiot trying to punch a super mutant to death.
---
STORY TIme with ROSE! Oh I love her
---
Have nothing to do with crafting Cores. Never crafted them *EVER* and get this bug. To be Fair Gatling Laser had all sorts of Bugs in Fallout 4 for example wit infinte ammo legendary you used everytime you shot 1 shot you'll eat through a entire 100% core. Also the problem with using 1 shot and reload to add a 99% core to your inventory. With 200 Cores all at 99 and 98% your inventory goes to a mess. This is fixed in Fallout 76 but the reload thing is still annyoing.
---
I guess it gets complicated for the engine to caculate ammo that is used by amor and by a weapon also at the same time. Still I guess something that is fixable but got forgotten.
---
I killed scorchbeast queen so many times i saw everything in game in scorched version haha.
---
Pretty much a basic rifle build it‚Äôs decent 
---
I thought I was the damn person getting armor or other crap from 2** and 3*** legendaries. I must have gotten every single piece of legendary armor in the game....(I sold most it, kept the weightless marine ones as I have the chameleon mutation). Good to see that I am not the only one.
---
I have 3 berets in stash but i think i don't have the donuts recipee.
---
I played for a couple of hours last night on PC with no issues at all. I was in Morgantown and noticed a quest pop up about attending a frat party and then found out that it was for the new brewing mechanic they put into the last update. I was doing that, until two players suddenly appeared (level 52 and 41) which I promptly ran away from, i'm only level 8. 
---
Bloodied fire axe / sledge hammer / deathclaw fist  can go over 3k writen damage so 9k sneak with 75% armor pene. Most enemies have aroun 500hps so..... who cares about numbers?
---
On pc we can see them, but can only get the option to join those in out friends list.  People generally dont notice/add random requests.

It is balanced, Who shots first win.

I said the same thing and still say it. 
---
Someones never laid concrete before.
---
EA (origin) customer support actually helped me out greatly.  I had DA and DLC all seperate and each time I installed the game, would have to go through multiple installs to do so.   I had trouble getting 1 DLC to install, forgot why.   They actually gave me the Ultimate edition and removed basegame/dlc from account.  Was pretty awesome thing to do actually.  Yes, I paid for everything but now I only had 1 install and managing it was much better. 
---
Well, would they be rare then?
---
I mean, he also reports on positive things, like new updates, features, and fixes. It's almost like he's doing videos on just about anything new in the game. If you read this sub often enough there's not much to be gained from juicehead vids outside of the couple people that reach out to him and give their account of X story where it concerns one individual. 
---
But srs, why do y'all watch things you hate? You don't catch me watching the Masters Tournament and posting on the PGA subreddits about how crappy it is.
---
Weird considering theyre atom shop items, easy way to save atoms i guess
---
You missed out. The atom shop moon mask is dropping like crazy right now.

---
lmao best comment of the day goes to you sir
---
You know any better rifle builds?
---
Or at least one of them. My idea is like Science boosts durability, Expert boosts damage, and Master maybe boosts ammo efficiency (like 50% chance not to use an ammo when firing).
---
That way we have a reason to equip those Science perks outside crafting. Really all crafting perks should have an "active" effect to give you a reason to actually use them (rather than just equipping them when you need to craft). Like home defense and how it affects trap disarm.
---
Oh shit, I should probably turn off my computer and hide in a bunker because I'm so scared
---
At the same time, I think they should do something to crafting perks to give you a reason to equip them in field. There should be any perks that make you go "oh, I'll only put that on when I'm in my camp and crafting stuff".
---
There's plenty of that in the game. It's much easier to get that side vs at launch. At launch there were a few bugs that you missed out on much of that unless you knew the workaround, but that's been fixed. There's plenty of that to experience and I think you'd enjoy the game
---
Stocks probably add damage because they have rifleman on and stocks turn that energy pistol into an energy rifle.
---
I‚Äôve seen that Danse lol
---
I‚Äôm full melee so not really sorry 
---
Firemen!!!
---
There's a 3 minute warning for nukes. If they really value anything there, they're just going to server hop. 
---
I did the event 3 times and got 3 masks.
---
Why does everyone feel so ENTITLED to EVERY rare item?
---
Oh my god!  I was totally distracted by the guy in the Bender mask.  How funny is that... that video was posted long before Fallout 76's announcement!
---
I feel you on that. The other day I lost caps standing in the way of someone trying slap kill a buddy I was with. My buddy has -0mm of health a radroach could sneeze on him and he would fall over. I rush over to see what‚Äôs going on, as he has all our scrap we went and farmed. 
---
So I get there and the rando is crouch there swinging away. I have passive mode on and run over and stand in the way. At this point the dude is non hostile as in no wanted or bounty.  He sees me stand in the way and winds up what must be a bloodied DG and insta clears my health. No slap, no nothing. I drop and don‚Äôt event get a revenge or nothing just a respawn down the road. 
---
So I don‚Äôt know what people go on about you can‚Äôt kill like that. 
---
Ah alrighty :)
---
I got mine a few days ago and have been distributing a few after I scrapped mine and learned the plan.
---
According to Google Maps, I live about five hours away from Helvetia.  It's sorely tempting for next year.
---
I would also love to see Mr. Handys/Nannies, Robobrains, or Mistresses of Mystery.  That would be epic.
---
One shot killing is not to be confused with PvP....  
---
The mere fact that such a thing is easily possible, unless one follows the meta and gets a specific set of perks and items to safeguard against it, is terrible balancing.
---
Remember right before the first beta when the Bethesda launcher deleted all of the game files hours before the beta started.
---
After release, there were lots of people who would interact with you. This changed with hoax about trade exploit, giving you workshop by leaving you in party, other stupid nonsense.
---
Now it took me so much time to trade stupid fasnacht beret whose i was only one people on globe who didn't get one from 50events done. I had so many people not even checking what i want to trade..... like i would eat their ass thu trading menu or what.
---
But game is on another level than it was in beta phase. And after playing this, i could never again play fo4,3 or new vegas. They were just too slow and empty, with no reason to min max char, or collect cosmetic.
---
Now i am super speed flying kangaroo flexing with orange beret on hat. Haha 
---
Ah thank you :)
---
This theory tracks. A synth escapes the Institute, Railroad sets him up with new menories as a junk trader in Rivet City. He then joins the Brotherhood. 
---
Lol.... you are so wrong.
---
I want this
---
Where does one get more orbital strikes, anyway?
---
Doesnt matter as we should all know by now that many steam users have made steam review pretty much worthless.
---
Nukashine is beast
---
The vast majoriy of complaints i see (aside from stability issues, which are getting better, but still a problem for most) can be distilled to "Wah. wah wah. This game isnt fallout5. I want fallout5." (direct quote from like 80%+ of the whiners)  
---
Sure, its got some issues. Yep, some are incredibly frustrating. To the point of game-breaking occasionally.  
---
But im with you, 100%. They're actively working to improve what they made. And overall it shows.  I really hope whatever exec made the decision to push a beta release to publish got fired. Out of a cannon. Into the sun. Having worked in software development circles, i can 100% assure you it wasnt the dev team that made that call. They knew it wasn't ready, and have probably been in practical panic mode for the last few months. Im really hoping they can pull off the planned roadmap. If so i think we'll see another "No Mans Sky."  A buggy, problem filled launch, that eventually turns into a great game. (disclaimed havent yet played NMS, this is just the resounding call i hear from those that stuck it out for the update)  
---
Side note: your English is fine. Better than many that speak it as their first (usually only) language.
---
Honestly if his footage was more than just him walking around in low level areas with shit gear, I could take him more seriously that he cared about 76.
---
Seriously an unmodded lever-action rifle? And you say you've spent 100+ hours playing? wat
---
If ur on PS4, add me. Scythe98. Or anyone else seeing this for that matter.
---
Yea I found this place a while ago and only used the bunker portion. I moved out though due to always being attacked when entering a server
---
I can think of at least two off the top of my head that you'd never know unless you kill them and see the parts on their corpses.  I'll be kind and not spoil them here.  And no, they're not Art.
---
That's cool, Still not buying it though :)
---
sure fucking did. no one cares
---
If your still accepting new members to your raider gang I'd like to join. My PSN is Realsouthdanks
---
I solid my first nuke about two weeks ago. The hardest part was when you had to protect the Chiefs. They glitched on me and progression stopped. 
---
Dont everybody by now know that steam reviews pretty much have lost their value?
---
Did you actually read a single word in any of my posts or did you just click on imgur links and make assumptions?
---
I stated so fucking clearly how my account got flagged. Drop trading. I never had that much ammo. I even showed it after I got unbanned.
---
Cool I‚Äôll add you 
---
It's not even so much the two-shot effect in general. It's that explosives are about as brainless to shoot in the general direction of the enemy as a VATS Crit build is. You don't need to be good at aiming to shoot at someone's general direction with an explosive shotgun. You've just pelted the floor with a ton of aoe explosives. It's like saying shooting at floors with the Soldier from TF2 takes more skill than landing direct hits. You'd get laughed at.
---
Not yet but I‚Äôll set one up on the weekend. What‚Äôs you GT?
---
then you should ask a game dev programmer. :)
---
Did you watch that video or read my thread at all? My guess is no to both.
---
I go into extreme detail that I did not have that much ammo and the reason I got banned. It was for drop trading ammo. It flagged me as picking up too much ammo, even though it was picking up the same 10k ammo over and over again.
---
It was a lot of fun and most folks did their part. Unfortunately, my last run failed because it stalled after we killed the mutie ambush. It resulted in a lot of any folks meleeing the bots. 
---
Just found a fresh event. Let‚Äôs see how it goes. 
---
Thank you.   
---
Never thrown it on a scale, but theres no way my buddies type56 (chinese knock-off of an AK47) weighs more than 10lbs (id guess like 6-7 ish with a standard mag.)  
---
its prob using cheaper materials than a proper russian made AK, but still.
---
Toilet paper is developed for fast dissolution, so it won't clog your toilet. It is funny as they are in shape after all those years.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Kinda wanna photoshop Joe Rogan‚Äôs face in there somewhere. This is epic.
---
Lol, you cannot get adequate answer here, we are fallout fans. They turned Fallout to Circus. I would never recommend start playing fallout from this game ;)
---
There is smoke in fo76? Is that only PC thing? 
---
Tomorrow? Its the 26th today, atleast in EU, and according to bethesda it Will release here in the afternoon 
---
Any word on when the update is planned for today? I've got a relatively new character (started a new one for shits n giggles) and was eager to hear about the new Survival.
---
If you still got room in your rag tag group, I'm here if you need me. 
---
That's the whole point... I would like Bethesda to have her drop guaranteed 3* every time so there's a good reason to spend all the resources on killing her. People would actively drop a nuke on fissure prime for a guaranteed 3* which has a chance to be something useful.
---
Would we still get furious walking canes with limb damage and reduced weight? Sure but at least there a decent chance it's going to be an Instigating sledge with swing speed and 1STR... Or some bloodied weapon with 2 extra guaranteed stars that have a chance to be useful. 
---
These make for great pvp items. Always fun to leave a roll in a brown baggie where my opponent died after the altercation fizzles.
---
I've never really used chems or alcohol but with the help of biv and the challenges, I unlocked the addiction minigame. At first I was annoyed but after a while I started to enjoy the adventure of scrounging for alcohol everywhere. Those vault dwellers really throw em back. Felt like a beer only satiated the beast for a minute or so. 
---
Yeah but whats 12lbs in terms of anything? I have weight reduction perks for all my weapons so things like my auto grenade launchers only weight 2lbs instead of 20lbs, total carry of around 300lbs so 12lbs is nothing really
---
I want an NCR ranger veteran outfit but I doubt that would ever happen 
---
Good exp, but no legendaries.
---
You can reset the spawns inside the building if you're teaming up with people. 
---
Been happening all week. Shits ridiculous.
---
That build is a perfect start for a rifle build tho like deff do most of that and just tinker a lil bit with other shit
---
Oh I‚Äôve seen that one! They sounded like two AI talking to each other. But really bad AI so their conversation was disjointed and almost creepy, in a way. 
---
Just make all hairstyles available no matter what sex your character is. That Would be far more inclusive, and open up a whole lot more diverse cosplay possibilities.
---
False = Todd
---
Riiiiiii-cola!
---
This makes me sad. But also hits me on a spiritual level.
---
LMAO I run a bloodied melee build with the DG we don‚Äôt do enough damage to one hit you. The only fucking way someone can slap kill you is if your low enough damage that a slap hit would kill you. Stop trying to nerf builds 
---
Well it is obvious.  There are no screw drivers left.
---
So you always need to break them apart to get the scraps.  
---
I had one who looked exactly like Piper! Wish I had taken a pic too, damn it.
---
I'm sick to death of reading "I died through slap damage". You engaged in some way. Figure it out.
---
I have ran this event neaely 30x haven't seen a beret
---
what system you play on, I would team up with you and roam the land
---
Even though they‚Äôre in the ammo section I never thought of taking that perk. Since you don‚Äôt shoot them it never occurred to me it‚Äôd have an effect. Great advice, thanks. 
---
Ah you must have bunches of strength.  I have sneak/rifle build with a 2 strength.  I think my max weight carrying is 160 before getting encumbered.  So that 12 lbs is quite a bit. I often have to struggle to keep it down to 120ish so I can actually loot some things.
---
don forget the PVP mode. 
---
Damn straight, comrade
---
Ya either owned a workshop, one of your mutations gave off a radius blast, your teammate hit him, you hit him, one shop slap damage doesn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm so tired of people like OP who doesn‚Äôt understand game mechanics bitching. Shit like this is what makes builds get nerfed. It‚Äôs stupid 
---
Sure just shoot me a friend request 
---
Eh, I don't watch because he does not deserve the few pennies from the ads from me.
---
You feel cool?  I swear on my fathers watery grave. I have no reason to lie. You believe whatever you want ok pal? You have a nice day pal. 
---
Yes, more natural cuts all round
---
That pic is awesome. Gonna have to step up my pic game 
---
Adderall is trash, puts me to sleep for 23 hours, every time I take it. terribad/10 gene drug interaction
---
PS4. 
---
PSN: Tabef
---
No, I can't... I'm just letting people know that they may have changed stance, no need to be a dick about it
---
For the record, I‚Äôm not farming Whitespring for XP either. I‚Äôm always taking over workshops, building camp stuff, and I do basically every event that pops up on the map. I have ADD so grinding the same spot over and over makes me physically uncomfortable and gives me a headache. Way too repetitive. 
---
Hell yeah I'm on PS4. I'll add you as soon as possible!
---
In that same vein, I care across an Insult Bot the other day. Would be funny if the bot just kept making fun of how I couldn‚Äôt grind Fasnacht Parade enough to get the rare mask. Lmao 
---
Coming close to 200 times now heh, pain in left eye 
---
10am PST
---
So where does dexmethylphenidate fit into your conversation?
---
Adderall puts me to sleep for 23 hours on the minimum doseage, every time I took it. terribad/10 gene drug interaction. 
---
Methylpheniadate (stopped working) moved to Dexmethylphenidate, have neurological sleep dissorder 1 in 8 times as rare as narcolepsy. (Just curious as I hadn't seen someone post a breakdown like that.) Why does methylphenidate/related not put me to sleep like Adderall does? :O
---
Soon Tm.
---
It‚Äôs not believing whatever I want. It‚Äôs called I believe facts. There has been many post proving your claim wrong. There hasn‚Äôt been a single post with prove of being one hitter with slap damage. But had been a shit ton of proof to prove you wrong.  Try again kid 
---
No idea, I get killed allot in melee but... I never PVP so I‚Äôm probably not talking about the same thing here anyway. 
---
That makes it even more entertaining to me. :) 
---
I often spawn off the side of a mountain. If it wasn't for bird bones,I would die quite often.
---
I really wanted to add more stuff like that but Budget limit slapped me.
---
Brilliant post.
---
That's still pretty hard to do when you have no mic, not to mention you have to meet the person, so you kinda have to stalk someone on the map, convince him you want to team up for legit reason (aka 'not to nuke your base to the ground'), then proceed to actually go to a nuke silo right after you've seen their CAMP location.
---
I dunno but I would be quite suspicious if a random dude came up, teamed up then saw the "NUKE LAUNCHED" message. But that might just be me.
---
Please do! hahaha! But thank you!
---
Nah, someone just decided to mini nuke the effigy just as I was in photo mode.   
---
Ended up being perfectly timed. 
---
I'm sure you've taken some great ones! 
---
Kellogg's outfit is definitely plausible, mostly because its essentially a leather jacket and combat pants with some full arm armour
---
Another poster was trying to defend Mr 900 and claim he could make 3-4k ultracite ammo per day.
---
He claimed Mr 900 played 12 hours a day, blah blah blah.    
---
i give them to him but in return he get me trolling him, so win win lol 
---
sorry bud im on XBOX
---
I swear there is a bug that causes you to disconnect after launching a nuke. I posted a similar thing 2 months ago. 
---
It took me a couple hours, had to repair my weapons 4 times each, wasted most of my ammo, used most of my aid, but I got through and launched the nuke. 
---
I fast traveled to just above Whitespring to watch the explosion, jumped down to walk in and I was disconnected. I was so angry I put the game down for a couple weeks. It was such a grind to launch that nuke and I got none of the reward out of it. 
---
Yeah it is all those water purifiers. Honestly I would scrap all but one or two. Using can do and pharna pharma will get you more water than you can use.
---
I really hope that they'll manage to pull of that road map. Especially player based vending machines are warmly welcome. Decades ago when I played Star Wars Galaxies there was player based vending machines and that was really good feature.
---
That's how mafia works 
---
When all plasma weapons were broken and shots would fly through enemies or do little damage that plasma flamer was the only weapon that would kill enemies fast.
---
It will be the new Xur.
---
We need the metal stairs at half the height like in fo4.
---
Theres only the full length ones and its particularly limiting.
---
Also metal fences would be nice.
---
For future reference, when you do this again, be sure to have all three "hacker" perk cards: There's about four or five terminals in the nuke silos which you can use to disable the turrets in the next room you're about to enter. Or, if you're feeling cheeky, disable their targeting restrictions, let them and the robots fight it out for a few minutes, THEN disable the turrets. 
---
I never understood why they did not make the primes capable of firing normal ammo as well.  Its not like its a huge benefit.    It just makes it so you don't have to have a copy of a weapon just for use in 1 fight.
---
Well, when you pick up individual cigarettes or cigars you hear a puffing sound, just saying. 
---
You sure can, I play on passive and I‚Äôve been killed from slap damage before :(
---
That's reassuring to know, thanks for the heads up!
---
They're for the Daily Quest: Ecological Balance  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ecological\_Balance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ecological_Balance) 
---
Its a fun gun to use. Just wish they'd give us some mods for it. The recoil is just terrible. Lol. Give us some compensators and a stock to help keep this bullet hose on target.
---
Used in a daily quest around the forest region 
---
There is a qualty control daily event that involves them, trihger is located in forrest area.
---
Basically you stop playing until the next content update, or you keep unlocking plans and stockpile resources. 
---
Yes! I was gonna ask about this the other day but I didn‚Äôt know if it was trivial or not. I have black characters (normally men because the limited hairstyles work better) and would like to make my character look more like me but the options for black women are basically buzz cuts and really short Afros. It‚Äôs not that big of a deal but irritating nonetheless 
---
Sadly I always felt the Dunwich was underdeveloped, it really felt like something more should have gone on, but it was good, probably the most memorable for me.
---
Pretty sure it's some sort of glitch. If you note there is a campfire in the pic
---
I've seen people in the 4 digit mark
---
Check my karma bro. It isnt affecting me.
---
Somehow you went pvp flagged. Was you in team, did you own workshop, did you have bounty,.... ? 
---
Well maybe you could be killed thru slap if you have 1%hp but from full it is not much posible
---
If it's efficiency you are after then melee is the way, with a bat I can clear a silo twice at the cost  of 8 wood and 5 adhesive. 
---
Yep definitely a good way to give em the shits.
---
Nah I play solo most of the time, and never claim workshops cause I don‚Äôt see the point :(
---
Haha. Ok. It was a crazy drop that bkew me away so i typed into my phone in like 30 sec. Is 30 sec of effort a no life thing to do?
---
2 things 1st you spawned under your foundation happens all the time when you fast traveled you got out from it 2nd the camp and scorched there were a random event so expect there to be other events spawning in there like the lemonade stand and crashed satellite
---
This guy took down almost a quarter of my health in one hit with the power fist...
---
I think what you meant to say was, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs rare, and then there‚Äôs EXCEEDINGLY RARE‚Äù. 
---
Those words in caps are both another way of saying what you said, and the exact words that Bethesda used when describing them.
---
Ok. Thank you
---
I feel this pain, placing E's on my sign was maddening. I ended up spelling the whole thing in reverse, because that's the only way I could get them to snap without too much hassle.
---
thats the insult man :D
---
Oh, I got a few great ones, but that's creative af
---
Sweet man. Nice. 
---
Everything.
---
It is not possible to do so much damage throught slap damage. Many people tested it. 
---
Also there were people, who would claim workshop, then invite you in party, leave server, join back (now workshop is your) claim that workshop to trigger pvp with you, kill you. But not slap damage one hitting was ever comfirmed with proof and it is biggest hoax on this site.
---
Try again kid... hmm? I see someone is small minded. 
---
Good day sir, I shan‚Äôt be seeing you again.
---
PvP is always on, majority of players will not be able to be seen or tracked on the map, the revenge button is off, fast travels are turned off mostly
---
Anyone can shootcha at any given point, with I believe a permanent 20% overall EXP boost
---
Bzzzzt! Sorry, the answer we were looking for was "Stripper Poles....stripper poles."
---
&gt; There are an additional dozen that only happen at Whitespring
---
I think I had one of these awhile ago, that or it was a really strange bug. But the usual ghoul farming location, with the wendigo, instead of all the ghouls and the wendigo, I got a literal horde of diseased level 50 protectrons. Some of them had treads so they were actually quite fast.
---
The best game ever? My lord how many games do you have or what kind of games do you have? Are they all call of duty? Lol its ok man I wont bother you no more its pointless üòÜ
---
It's not the graphite that contains the lead, but the "Baby Toy Yellow" paint on that #2
---
The problem is with the naming.
---
Is actually hovergrain, not razorgrain.
---
As a matter of fact is not a grain at all, is a fungal predator of the stalker persuasion camouflaged as a clump of grain that can generate an antigravity field to facilitate quick and silent displacement.
---
I clearly stated I wasn‚Äôt one-shotted lol. I was over encumbered and couldn‚Äôt run away fast from the guy when I realised how much damage he was doing to me. 
---
Gut feeling. Don‚Äôt by what‚Äôs on the market here. A lot of stuff is over inflated. 
---
Yes damn it. I want long hair on my feminine male character! There's like one or two long hair styles for men but they look ugly :/
---
Have you not explored the enclave bunker? Something tells me that's gonna be a vault raid
---
Initiate isn't even in the drop pool anymore 
---
I played a lot of ESO, and things like what platform you played it on, level etc. Had a big factor on the price is that still true? 
---
For example I have a Fasnacht Beret I'm happy to sell for caps if the price is right, how much should I sell it for? (PS4)
---
Every one with sentinel armor, please oh please just stand in one spot
---
Had about 10 copies of all the normal masks but had to get the beret through a trade as well as it just wouldn‚Äôt drop for me.
---
Hello hello hello
---
I have a bloodied plasma rifle its amazing. 
---
I'm curious too. I see that a lot of things have a set "value" when you inspect them. Are you supposed to sell over or under the pre determined value? We will learn together haha 
---
U could roam around as a gang of raiders threatening player camps. U could give them 3options. 
---
1. Pay 200 caps in protection money to leave them alone 
---
2. Given access to resources such as food junk etc. To leave them alone
---
3. If they fail to cooperate, kill them. 
---
There will be plenty of opportunities to extort players  in survival. 
---
Just an idea I thought feel free to use it lol
---
no idea. I study chem for myco-remediation. (Using fungi, like mushrooms, to break stuff down) So I've got quite a bit of Ochem under my belt, but practically nothing in the human bio realms.
---
Once you throw people and our crazy ass molecules/reactions into the mix, I run away crying. 
---
Pretty much. And the beret is rare but starting to be common. I‚Äôd 350ish on mine if I was selling. But I sell based on what they feel like paying. 
---
There's no teleport trigger and no vault 51 cell in the data files at all. There is a vault 65 in the data files that only has an interior and no external vault door yet. There's another vault door as well that exists in the files but not in the world nor does it have a seperate cell for its innards. 
---
They run out so quickly! You down an entire bottle of wine and you‚Äôre sober again in a couple minutes!
---
I‚Äôve been running round with an alcohol addiction in game for a while now lol.
---
their already looking into doing it. its.something we wanted to do. theres already enough ammo out there that its just flooded the market and expanding the crafting system with a few more recipes doesnt add bugs like you think it does its just item in equals items out. 
---
Sad news, there is no Hardened .50 cal receiver in the game. Highest damage is .50 Refined, which is 1 damage short of .308 hardened. It's still worth it - .50 cal is easier to craft and rifle sounds powerful without the suppressor.
---
More floor type like from wasteland workshop would also be neat for some really cool home designs
---
One shot killing is utterly accceptable survival mechanic. The idea of having a build that stacked every aggresive capability, and a build that atacked no defensive capabilities, and the second one being able to live the shots from the first one is ridiculous. Stay adventure.
---
atleast thier adding passive mode truely since the new survival mode is a thing finally we can play the game the way we want to without others messing with us. go to hardcore survival if you want pvp.
---
So much toilet paper, so many toilets and porta-potties and I am not allowed to take a dump, not even to fertilize my vegetable garden.
---
No wonder there is so much bad blood in post-apocalypse Appalachia with all this anal retention going on...
---
We need CWSS for FO76!
---
Yet. With all the clipping issues theyve had, I'm not surprised they'd leave it out of assests.
---
can't have the dataminers pulling all the secrets just yet.
---
Now the events over time they'll become increasingly rarer and more valuable üëå
---
Thats why i love this game, bethesda keeps surprising us 
---
Bring back the scaffolding kit from fo4 contraptions. Green houses too while they're at it, those additions plus weapon and armour racks made the whole season pass worthwhile 
---
Nope, in fact, a mole rat viciously spawned in my gated garden and started maiming my beautiful watermelon loving flamingos. Two scarecrows were present.
---
Also the corner gate has been attacked by Scorched where one of them is, but, they always come from that direction.
---
Beautiful 
---
Ah yeah im maxxed out on 15 strengh mainly for the carry weight
---
All you do is lose an insignificant amount of health until you attack him back, then damaged is normalized. 
---
im sick of Mr Squeeze already. He randomly pops up like once a day for me. i just buy the lemonade and foresake plan dupes.
---
The gatling laser uses them as ammo so it is possible to shoot them too
---
There's definitely one missing in the ash heap, it's at a junction outside one of the air purifier sites and it's super reliable. Yesterday I got a deathclaw getting owned by super mutants, and upon returning the was a crashed vertibird stuck in the road.
---
'*Take it to the limit*...'
---
It won't be okay. Get back in the Vault, milk drinker.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Everything else in this game that is ‚Äúrare‚Äù is relatively easy to obtain, simply by grinding.
---
We need more of this sort of stuff IMO
---
It just means that he is attacking you and if you choose to shoot back you initiate pvp and have a chance to get that amount of caps of him you kill him. You will also lose caps based on your level if he kills you
---
Speaking of stairs, how does any one get a 3rd story. I can never place a set on the second floor..
---
Thanks, what does the 70c mean ? I thought I might have lost 70c.
---
im hope the survival daily/weeklys wont force you to go to specific places that assholes can stake out all week.
---
The ‚ÄúC‚Äù stands for caps and it is a reward if you successfully kill your attacker. 
---
I know this happens, but a strange thing happened today.  Killed a three star ghoul and it dropped .38 ammo and a gold fork.  I looked away, wandered the area a bit, and went back, and there wasn't anything else.  After searching the area a little more, I went back, and there was a three star weapon on the corpse.  It had been awhile.  I don't know why it would take so long to spawn.  (BTW it was an Assaultron Head that had a bonus for bashing.   thpppttt)
---
They are basicaly challenging you to fight with them. If you have pacifist mode (in game options) turn on, you are safe. If you want to fight back, turn pacifist of and kick their asses when they don't expect it.
---
...if your offering...
---
-\(++)/-
---
Dont you also drop aid items along with your junk on death?
---
Wanna get your mind blown. Did you know that the main character in each fallout is actually a synth. Vats is actually mentioned as being a synth ability. Your character in each fallout has vats. Check it out on YouTube they explain it in depth. 
---
Seriously though! They got the little directions sign and everything, that‚Äôs so awesome 
---
Easy, they were very front heavy so they added more weight to the back to balance them out /s
---
Price on the item in game does not match a price in trading. I got a bloodied/swing speed/+1 strength Meat Hook and it waa valued as 20 caps in game but it is one of the most valued item in trading: I got offered 70k caps for it
---
Already running 21 simultaneous connections before even logging into a game server. They need to clean up their TCP/IP interfaces BEFORE they add anything more to them. Havent had a chance to do any intense scrutiny of packets/other modern games yet. But a quick ResourceMonitor pull on Starcraft2 shows 10 while ingame. 
---
I agree its not as good as previous Fallout games but its def alot better than the youtubers / spit gave it credit for 
---
Perfectly reasonable 
---
What the hell ? When did it happen ? Where ?
---
It is possible, like almost everything in this game. I have a full set of assassin/sentinel armor and a random guy killed me once with 2 or 3 hits in a power fist. I had no workshop and I'm sure I didn't hit or shoot him or his teammates. After all the shit we've seen in this game I don't know why you're surprised on another bug/exploit.
---
Thanks :)
---
What i do is just go around explore, and visit other players to maybe play with them or help them.
---
it would remove all rarity from the masks, especially if you could get them after the even finishes 
---
Its ironic, y'all criticize him for blindly hating on Fallout 76 and yet you blindly hate on him...
---
One of mine is still rocking the party hat and glasses at level 112. Not seen anyone else doing that lol. Goes well with the vault-tec pyjamas.
---
That special week they raised the odd of encountering him, i was near one of WS main gate (western one) and tree differents Mothman spawned at the same time, i was surrounded. There was a green one. What surprised me the most, the robots didn't had any reaction.
---
Unlike Juice who has hardly played the game, I have watched most of his 76 related videos. So I don't think it's *blind* as you so cleverly tried to point out.
---
That's nice. Gunsmith will keep shotgun from breaking too soon but it will break. Maybe carry 2 shotguns, all rise sledgehammer, dcg, on you. Weapon artison and fix it good (armor) perks are needed for repairs.
---
Lots of good flux and materials. 
---
Fun fact: even though you may advance the quest a few steps, you have to start from the beginning if you rage quit until the next day.  The hardest part of this mission was the maze that is the level.  Then, it rebuilds the security.  Not just some regular enemies...but assaultrons.  It rebuilds assaultrons.  I completed this two days ago.  The day prior, I got to the point where I have to fix the mainframe, all my weapons had broke, I had blown through countless stimpaks, and so I rage quit.  I logged on the next day.  Then, I found out that you can initiate and complete one mission without actually having the code.  That's when I quit again.  I'll complete it one day.  I just can't stomach going into that site again.
---
I would only agree to this if it would purely be junk that was lootable.
---
I get a message my photos are full and before taking new ones I should delete them (PS4) any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.
---
Server hopping does nothing. It's faction and timer based. 
---
I've seen one player with the winter man mask (in over 50 events)only one event didn't drop a mask at all due to 3 destroyed bots.
---
i doubt there is any parameter to spawn the rare masks it's probably just a random number generator with a misplaced decimal point,this game has failed like that before ( fusion core factory) .
---
there's a youtuber " rifle gaming" with a couple screenshots of the jester and sun masks, not sure what platform he is on.
---
I was all set to PM you my work schedule so we could coordinate and pal around. 
---
Instead, Sir (or madam, as the case may be), I wish upon you the most grievous of curses. I wish that every steak you eat in the future to be well done. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôll think of this day and your transgressions. 
---
^not really. It was pretty funny. 
---
So then you would know his content isn't all negative and he is happy with the recent updates, He reports on rumors because it gets clicks, clicks mean money, money means he can continue his channel. If you dont like that kind of business model why even visit YouTube?
---
agree 100%
---
- spiral stairs that only take up one square
---
- wooden stairs
---
- stair sets that match the atom shop flooring, or at least ones that don't use the transparent grate flooring.
---
And make them look a bit less like weird stickers
---
Couldn't they just make it that headgear = no hair? I'm sure they already do it for the beehive hairstyle.
---
Or are you talking about clipping into a players shoulders or something? 
---
I hope that dude is out there enjoying Fallout 76, that's amazing.
---
That TSE pump breaks very slowly. And i have weapon artisan perks, fix it good aswell and ammosmith aswell .  Those perks arent active perks though, so i just swap perks whenever i need to make ammo, or do repairs 
---
I see youre waiting for Raid Vaults, high density Underground mobs, Legendary players, and other end game content too.   
---
Were waiting till the "Nuclear Summer" event. Launches this summer, no exact date yet. Though the last part of this event release may 23rd (legendary vendor. first new thing im actually excited for.   
---
Cool to see the entire server jump to Helvetia for Faschnact, but honestly one of the most uninspired meta-fetch quests I've played in any game ever. Seriously. Completed the event twice. Once was by accident because i was trading too close to Helvetia.  
---
There‚Äôs already pink and blue hair in game though?
---
There's a guy in the video with a Deathclaw mask even though this was made before the game was even announced! So cool.
---
Too much for the game to handle if your charecter has naturally oily skin. Not even an RTX 2069 could handle that 
---
You're lucky I'm still awake.
---
If you want to retain the photos before deletion, Try to save the photo by pressing the "Share Button" on your controller. 
---
After, Try to delete the photo in the in-game menu.
---
Should you have too many photos stored in your PS4, I'm afraid you may have to delete something or get more memory by purchasing a harddrive or usb.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what your problem is. It‚Äôs possible where you sat down camp and where you started the foundation that you are limited to two floors there. I never have issues placing them down and getting atleast three stories. Once I was lucky and got 4. Then usually three stories down if you are on a cliff side or you place the camp down up on preexisting stairs.
---
The stairs should just snap to the 2nd floor.
---
Once my tesla rifle somehow had all my ammo loaded into it, 999+ shots that persisted through reconnects. Man, that was a fun few weeks. When it eventually had to reload, going back to only 8 rounds I was fucking gutted. 
---
Because whitespring is the most boring.
---
I solo'd a nuke launch at like level 40
---
I get a message to delete photos before I can make new ones, do you know how to delete them (PS4)
---
Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.
---
Pennywise.
---
True.
---
Didnt even notice.
---
But then why sliders?
---
Fo76 surprised everyone with a wholesome community. 
---
He straight up makes stuff about game going F2P, presents his opinions as headlines and basically reads out reddit posts.
---
My plan is to not play in survival with all the people running duped sentinel assasin with a one shot sneak build
---
A guy from vault 76
---
Havent played for a while but I think survival will bring me back. I'll be the stealthy type for sure. 
---
When we die by players or mobs, do we lose everything?
---
I haven‚Äôt found a single one of those. I haven‚Äôt even seen another player with one. I thought they weren‚Äôt in the game lol. 
---
Hell yeah
---
Spook
---
Just a random pre-War building
---
Does that mean i have to wait until November when we go back to PST? or can i just add an hour and call it PTD?  
---
(i really am sorry for the snarky comment, I just had to. i forgot about the stupid PST/PDT thing and have been posting PST for the last 2 weeks too)
---
This would be so much more cutting if it didn‚Äôt come from someone who supports rape. 
---
Thanks for your efforts.
---
Wasteland Don Quixote. I gallivant around Appalachia as a knight-errant, upholding the virtues of chivalry. Metal Armor, a Sentry Bot Helmet, and a Revolutionary Sword (among other ye olde weapons, like The Dragon). My camp is lit and furnished exclusively with antique decorations, too. 
---
and yes, the few times I've got my mic on I'll talk in ye olde speak.
---
They got it spot on 
---
Can i ask you guys a question? I've been using that famous lvl 45 duped tse handmade since november last year. Now ,after the nerf,i would like to differentiate a bit so which one should i choose? Aae,bloodied,furious?
---
Have you reported him?
---
Same! close to 100 all I wanted was jester I wasn't sure if I missed one cause the sloth could drop masks and glitched often
---
As someone who hasn't played since a bit before Christmas this is the kinda thing I was fearing coming back too
---
Did they ever comment on/does anyone know why they'd let character transfer fly to survival after the whole duping shenanigans?
---
I would love to see this
---
Anti armor explosive 2 shot. If you get 2 of those its godlike.
---
Hopefully they bring more balance to the builds so we don‚Äôt keep seeing the same 2 all the time. It‚Äôs boring.
---
Not everything!
---
I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) you lose some med supplies, caps and junk
---
Anything else I'm not 100% sure on
---
There seems to be a weird bug that all fusion cores I find in power armor now always have 25% left. It's been more than ten that have that level. I always check before taking and never take the ones with less than 75%.
---
   Chyeah man, people have spoken about grieving, I've been griefed, once, way back at level 25, but overall most people are really helpful.  It'll stay that way on the adventure server.  
---
Someone on here had a post asking Bethesda to implement a gift box icon to show you were trying to give someone something.  Which would be wonderful because once I chased this poor level 11 across half the map to give him a decked out level 15 Combat Rifle. Bahaha
---
I had a similar experience. My camp is on popular spot in the toxic region. Since the last update, it load very slowly, one part at a time. 
---
Last time, i saw small generstors around my harvestor and in my house. I only use the fusion one. The small generators slowly disapeared. I think it was the onloading of another player camp.
---
Ugh I know what you mean, I‚Äôve gotten the same recipe as a reward 5 times now! I just want to unlock all the recipes man.......
---
On a side note, anyone on XB1 wanna purchase the New River Red Ale recipe lol
---
Yes i need 50 more to complete the scrap plasma challenge and it's taking ages. But yeah the enclave events have a higher chance of dropping them.
---
As someone still trying to acquire AA versions of my fave weapons for Survival mode, this is so accurate it hurts.   
---
On paper my TSE combat shotty is 30% more damage than my ghoulslayers explosive. In reality the spread is so much tighter on non-TS variants, that i usually kill with 40%-50% fewer shots fired. I basically only carry the TSE when im hardFarming, and dont wanna jump back to camp for repairs.
---
If you‚Äôre not wanting to server hop (like me) the ant meat is sooo difficult to find much of 
---
I got addicted to alcohol today. :(
---
Agreed, i‚Äôd Like to play something fun, but also strong, like automatic weapons in stealth, what would you recommend?
---
I sadly missed Hot Rod. I really want that one.
---
My builds always hit the roof and then I start optimizing to get in more stuff.
---
I keep hearing about junkies, what‚Äôs so special about it?
---
Ikr, the ts spread is unreal, only works kinda fine on shottyS
---
Always visit any neighbours I happen to have on the server and invite them round to my place haha
---
The first thing is inconvenient the second thing is cool, but you would think the game wouldnt load random events when a player base is ontop of it
---
There has always been a visual bug on the health of the pod. You need to look at the event meter in the top right corner.
---
I never had any problem with this event.
---
I woulda loved a deathclaw mask in game.
---
If youre addicted to each chem and alcohol you do tons of damage at the risk of your stats
---
Teach me üòçü§§
---
For me I launched my first nuke 2day ago, the only thing I knew is the code, but that's all, I was alone, with my vampire weapon and something like 50 stimpack, super stimpack and diluted stimpack, I left with 25, but to be honest it was more easier then I thought 
---
I get far better damage when AoE proccing off someones face than i do the floors/walls. AoE effects have damage falloff based on distance.  
---
I do use the spray off walls/floors for dealing selective damage to mobs (EG: dont wanna 1 shot, and im too lazy to swap to a lower damage weapon)  
---
Now that sounds a bit more interesting. I just have felt that the game was "empty" and we not talking about no human npc or players now. I picked up Fallout 4 as I never played it really, put it on survival and I am having a BLAST in the game. 
---
Sure it is my first play through and I am taking stuff super slow, building up the 3-4 settlements I have. Scavenging for food and materials and the world feels ALIVE and DANGEROUS. None of this I ever felt really in F76 for some reason. I can't put my finger on the difference really and hope that F76 can give me the same feeling as F4 is doing on survival.
---
I hope I am making some sense with my ramblings :)
---
Already have it anyways thats for the heads up tho
---
There is an atomic reskin of the stairs with platform already in game. Will be available for purchase eventually I hope. Can be previewed in camp 
---
Once you buy it from atom shop you can craft it.
---
I'm guessing someone crafted a shit load as it only takes 3 cloth to make and just dropped them all 
---
wont be on for \~5 hours, but if you still need then, same IGN.
---
Many people tested it, because too much people were claiming that they were killed with slap damage. Even with stacked boobleheads back when it was thing, you could not kill with slap damage. With 1milion damage. 
---
So only way you can be 3shoted is that you were flaged as pvp. Also melee weapons stagers you, so sentinel effect doen't matter.
---
Okay, exactly a big downside like bloodied
---
Waste of material on brewing anything except nukashine!
---
I cant complain too much. Everyone was so salty about TSE nerfs, i got em for practically free.
---
Glass cavern has a dead soldier that spawns. But there are hard to find plans for chest,arms and legs.
---
Exactly!
---
Let us scrap legendaries for tokens and redeem them at the vendor to buy exactly what we want. 
---
This won't remove the necessity to grind and farm legendaries - but having a clear and unambiguous goal (let's say 50 tokens for the swing speed effect) is far more interesting, engaging and rewarding than the current purgatory of RNG.
---
Because it's too late, everybody have duped items now, even if they don't know it cuz it seemed legit when they bought it (pretty sure all my tse guns are duped event tho i was buying them at 20k caps) 
---
I didn't had a chance of having my hands on the op armors, and playing PA versus those armor is straight up suicide,even people with no aim whatso ever will have access to sneak vats crit and os you while you do little to no damage because of the affixes sentinel + assassin
---
Yeah thats good.
---
Thats so helpful!
---
Thats good.
---
They're in, theyre just questionable to use, theyre not great and before this latest patch broke after about 1 core
---
Yes that is a very good tip.

---
I can mod your combat armor into BOS 
---
Yeah the last thing I expected was for high levels to give me so much free stuff.
---
I would argue against that first point, I don‚Äôt think by any means a teenager is as susceptible to impressions as a kid from 3-11, as to me that seems to be when the majority of their behaviors are molded. No doubt, Teenagers are certainly Impressionable. But I highly doubt the degree is anywhere close between a young adult  and an actual child. Imho.
---
The in-game version feels so accurate to the original thing.. Well done, devs!
---
I can truly say, that I wouldn't have learned about this if it wasn't in the game right now..
---
Clipping with outfits and armour would be the biggest issue I imagine
---
So sorry to hear that. Some say the apocalypse can bring people together too. I know a fair share of survivors who I know call a friend.
---
Pretty sure slap damage is capped at 5. So unless you had really low hp 
---
Yeah thats a really good idea.
---
That stuff already happens though, I don't think anyone would care that much. For example Mistress of Mystery outfit and multiple helmets, like the space suit helmet. 
---
I just won a plasma legendary gatling at Fasnacht! This is the only plasma I have

Has there been any news on if we can link Bethesda accounts to Steam. Even if we have to repurchase, that's better tha nnothing. Is there any BGS peeps that can clarify?

If I'm flagged as pvp there's a red triangle over the other player's head, there were no such thing. 
---
Test result would convince me if we were talking about a game developed by a studio that has skilled programmers and leaders, not Todd and his friends, but in this case we're talking about a game which tried to detect cheat programs by searching for their misspelled name, and now the modding community is not there to fix the other million mess of bethesda, so sorry if I believe my eyes more than other's test result.
---
I'm not pished...
---
Sony wasnt ok with console when this game was in development. Beth had no problem with it. A month or two ago, I think beth mentioned about sony's being open to it but I don't know if that ever went anywhere.
---
The general consensus is that people want cross-play for more robust players. I cant see any sequential downsides of cross-play.
---
You can't ? dang I didn't tested but I thought you could.
---
That's bad.

wouldn't it be in paperbag ?

I watched a guy spend 5 minutes whittling down an AFK guy's health yesterday and kill him after a fasnacht parade event, it was all slap damage and he got the kill in the end. I know you're mostly complaining about one shot slap damage but considering the poster you replied to is complaining about dying from slap damage in general I thought I'd mention it.
---
I mean it doesn't sound like people want it to be realistic, it sounds like even in a fictional world it doesn't make sense that a minigun weighs less than a rifle
---
Even then, doesn't the minigun slow you down when you have it out? Why does the thing that weighs less slow you down more?
---
Doesnt it depend on the platform though? For me on ps4, it says the maintenance is happening at 10 am est
---
I didn't even know you can have male/female character.
---
On ps4 its saying 10 am est
---
Yeah, even though there are some toxic piles of shit on this game, the amount of generous and wholesome people on this game far out number them. I've actually had two supernice people who helped me out in the long run: one level 70ish dude who gave me an all star bat with a searing puncturing rocket, and someone else who sold me a three star auto grenade launcher for 200 caps and just gave me the ammo.
---

Hey there! Love seeing the updated map! Random events have always been one of my favorite things about Fallout, so naturally, I have been adding random encounter locations to my map that I've been using for other things for a the past few weeks, since I tried to farm for the witch costume recipe. 
---
You've inspired me to share mine. [Big Map of Random WIP](https://i.imgur.com/46sgFiL.jpg)
---
When I updated my list, I did reference to [aj170's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a509c9/random_encounter_location_map/) and also [snikta471's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a63lw5/wip_random_encounter_map/). I used the WAY map by GOLDENTRIANGLES over on Nexus so that I could zoom in and track specific locations a lot easier. I did add 4 locations that I saw on your map, and the one [Lordofappalacia](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lordofappalacia) mentioned onto mine as I hadn't run across them before, after I checked them out. 
---
I can verify the one to the east of Johnson's Acre is still there, just ran into a tank there today. I have personally visited each of these spots, and I know there are some that I am missing that I've meandered past before I started tracking them, so I'll also be updating my personal map when I hear of or find more.
---
Anywho, the grid-type map has really helped me to locate things a lot easier. For example, Helvitia's spawn is in square F7. I hope this helps all ya'll out!
---
Your account has actually made me somewhat curious about the damage splash does in comparison to a direct hit now. Needs further experimenting and information provided, honestly. It's game mechanics that aren't really explored and explained enough. For example, I can look at explosive shotgun footage and see how little someone needs to aim at someone in slow motion and gauge that the aoe damage from the pellets does a sizeable amount of damage either way and that a direct hit, which wouldn't have done much damage due to falloff at the effective distance the explosive aoe does, would have done far less damage.
---
Maybe damage falloff of explosive weaponry should have the same falloff its base weapon has. For example, an explosive shotgun is still a shotgun, and as such its pellets won't be doing much damage at an effective range (without the Skeet Shooter perk card), thus the explosives that go off from the pellets should also do no damage unless in effective shotgun damage range. The downside to this is that it now means explosive sniper rifles would then become a thing, though I guess that is a hell of a lot less *SPAM FIRE IN GENERAL DIRECTION* than the current metagame is.
---
How am I an idiot for not knowing how am item is acquired in a virtual game.
---
I think the issue for super long hair is that it would be computationally taxing to keep it from clipping into the character model itself. so your back length hair might intersect with your back.
---
How you know everyone would have sentinel assasin? Btw i get myself set of sentinel (not assasin) gear in 50hours so, uhm don't be jealous to other ppls. 
---
You're right about Water Purifiers. I'm already carrying over 200 water all the time.
---
oh so no debuff?  so theres no penalty or downside to being killed repeatedly..just dont carry aids or caps. and the person that kills you gets no rewards..seems a bit shyt lol
---
 [Cannibal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=1s) 
---
what platform?
---
To be honest, PC and Xbox would be logical. Not sure sony will ever allow it. Just curious as to you not wanting any console players, not to be rude.
---
I don‚Äôt know what happens if you have no caps, but on the inside the vault post they said you would drop a random amount of aids. I do wonder what the person will get if you get killed with no aids and no caps but I guess we will find out when we play.
---
How much for bloodied explosive vats lever action!?!
---
I love BIV I think he‚Äôs a great addition to the game. I often think about him when I‚Äôm wandering the wasteland, alone down in that basement sloshed out his face but he is sooo happy just wheeling around talking to himself and his friend Bricky. 
---
It‚Äôs a hilarious breath of fresh air having a drunk bot with some personality aside from the usual ‚Äúhow bout you STOP...lookin‚Äô and start...BUYIN‚Äô‚Äù

I was thinking about it, but the last issue of ITV made me realize that I'd unneccessarily gimp myself by doing so.
---
Honestly, 2/3 of the hairstyles suck because they are exactly the same just minorly different, atleast for women. In general we need more **free** customizations, the paid ones should be something special, not the basics that we need and they didnt deliver.

He could also take the full charge perk which completely does away with the sprinting so problem, I have two ranks of full charge and two ranks of power user and one fusion core lasts around forty minutes
---
I reached a point where it's like, 'okay, you win Bethesda, I'll buy the Goblin Mask from the atom store' which is what I expected they wanted, but it's not in there. Generally it's what other online games do when they torment players with bad RNG. They made them impossibly rare for pretty much no reason it seems though. Unless it happens after the event ends, heh.
---
I had two instances where no bots died and I got no mask out of 30 or so runs. I think I got a Beret when one of the robots died\~ I'm not 100% sure. I do know it was around the time when a robot died, which only happened once, so it may of been that run...
---
I tried not to waste too much time on it since no one else had been getting them in far more attempts and I was already annoyed at farming impossible drops from Warframe's recent event; but at least those items existed. 
---

I sometimes try to form a team of randos fur just this reason. Sucks that you have to do this though.
---
Market is pretty much just an auction house. Bid your price

[Here's how I normally avoid videos on YT I don't like.](https://imgur.com/a/2MvKhNj) If you're actively seeking it out just so you have something to complain about, I really have no suggestions for you. Perhaps instead take up a hobby or a game, or wait...
---
Sacrifice a goat to the RNG gods, then kill legendary mobs.
---
Shame...
---
It's a low low chance drop from any quest in the mire region 
---
What....I know kill legendary enemies I don‚Äôt know where to find legendary enemies 
---
I have friends who play console and the player base is different. They have way more issues with trolls and griefers. I have never had a player drag a mob to my camp, never had a player destroy my camp, never had a player pvp me repeatably until I changed servers, never had a player try to bounty honey trap me, and I rarely have a player challenge my workshops. My guess is that the console players are a much younger crowd than the PC players.
---
I am talking about daily challenges, not quests :) That ones you get atoms for. I like BIV quests too.
---
Hopefully people see this and upvote it. It's fucked up that we have a while bunch of people swearing on their children that the masks are in the game just because Bethesda said so. Anyone who doesn't believe it is an entitled crybaby. Really curious how Bethesda couldn't do anything without being scrutinized a couple weeks ago, but all of a sudden they write infallible code? We already had a post similar to this that used data and info direct from the code, and after it got upvoted for a while it was drowned out by another, emotional post telling people that the event isn't about getting rare masks, basically telling anyone concerned with the rates to get over it. It's really fucked up that some of us grinded our hearts out when the system is bugged, and even more fucked up that half of the community doesn't give a shit. 
---
a random amount of aid items. and im going to assume its all the junk like we have now.
---
Nuke whitesprings therell be like 3 3*s 
---
Legendaries are random, so to the game (apart from the stars) there's no such thing as "good" or "bad". That being said, right now I've found the easiest place to farm legendaries is still The Whitespring. At the golf club I easily take home 5 legendaries per server jump, and they're ghouls so with full blocker I basically take no damage. This method is what leveled me up quite a bit from level 30ish to 50, but I'm 100 now and still go there when I want legendaries to sell.
---
"Good ones" are subjective. I suggest farming *Whitesprings*, *Watoga* and *Harper's Ferry*, then whenever *Event: Uranium Fever* and *Event: AWOL Armaments* are on. Also do not keep or stash legendaries whose effects you don't like.
---
Thanks 
---
I‚Äôve seen Deep Pocketed Leather Plans spawn by the armorer bench in Flatwoods (both pocketed and deep pocketed) rare though.  
---
I‚Äôve had Deep Pocketed Combat Plans spawn in the church in Harpers Ferry by the bench there.  Again rare. 
---
Never seen BOS Mod Plans spawn since the vendor change.  I hear they may be very rare rewards for Bog area events and treasure maps.  I did get another Combat Armor Mod Plan once for doing the daily Cop a Squatter but it was not BOS.  At least it let me know Plans were in the reward pool.  
---
Awesome093
---
Uranium fever event or Whitesprings are my general go to spots.
---
Ok 
---
Smart
---
Hahah, yeah.. honestly that'll probably end up being me too! But I gotta try. Friggin' kitties! :D
---
Thank you very much 
---
The next meta is to gang up. The most all around 1v1 build I believe to be ranged cavalier-sentinel mix (its unpopular opinion that everybody who seen it in action accepts), and the truth is that even all-around is not all-purpose-optimised and you need an aligned team if you really want to max stuffs.
---
I don't want to cinvince anybody. I've just seen enough code snippet from the executable to know if somebody states that this is impossible then he is just guessing it. And yeah there are crybabies like everywhere, but I can decide after 300 hours of gameplay that I was flagged for pvp or not, since I do a lot of pvp and this thing only happened me one time. Not necessarily an exploit, maybe a bug that doesn't show when you're flagged, but that can clearly happen.
---
Fun fact. There‚Äôs also lead in all full paint cans and any painted kids toy (wooden blocks being my favourite secret lead source). 
---
If they‚Äôre adding Uranium to Cola and powering their lawn mowers with fusion cores, I don‚Äôt think health and safety was top of the list pre-war. 
---
Also where in white springs anywhere in particular or no 
---
1k on be combat shotty if you're on ps4 (list you're platform)
---
Yep. No sense caring if it ain't my platform.
---
thebudd#5141
---
That's the dude who told me he bought it from another player. So who knows how it came into this world. 
---
How much is it worth in caps?
---
Mystery confirmed!
---
I got the bos combat armor mod from technical data.
---
At the very least, this is worth looking into, rather than just writing us off. We deserve a statement better than "it's out there keep looking"
---
I have no problem avoiding things I hate, or even dislike. I bet most of these people do not as well, and make their choices based on reasons other than like/dislike.
---
Regardless, your comparison was, as I said, apples and oranges.
---
What level must you be to be able to do that?? I am constantly struggling with building budget
---
What are the names of the rare masks?
---
I thought that was fixed? 
---
It wasn‚Äôt a waste saving up 10 addictols in my stash box. Drink 10 liquors, then take an addictol to get 10 atoms. Ridiculous.
---
A note on shotguns in video games. I hate them. Theyre so bloody unrealistic as to be essentially not even shotguns.   
---
Has any game developer actually fired one? Because theyre all doing it wrong. I dont really hunt anymore, but when I did I was absolutely lethal @ 25 yards. And im not even a good shot. My uncle is, and was still easily effective at 40+ yards (He tended to run pretty tight choke.)  
---
Its been quite a few years, but IIRC, any half decent load in a 12 gauge, unchoked, should still hit 20-30 yards, without any issues. A bit of barrel constriction can push that out quite a bit further. (i seem to recall my Gpa and uncle ranging shots up to like 50-60 yards pretty reliably. Kids had to change targets, so we did quite a bit of running back then. And the adults could get good and wasted. Prob not the best design. But we all survived, somehow.)
---
Just whitesprings
---
That's up to the buyer/seller. Nothing has a set value. One item, say an outfit to keep it in the same ballpark, you may love the look of and value at 10k while someone else thinks it is really ugly and wouldn't pay 1k for. 
---
Bet dude
---
Its going to be full teams of people with medics flamethrowers and friendly fire.
---
Fair enough
---
Is it still going to activate mutations when hit? Electrically charged, unstable isotope, etc. 
---
My TSE minigun pre-rate of fire nerf could accidentally kill someone through slap damage if I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. 
---
Not sure where it is now, but someone somewhere showed that slap damage capped at 5% HP per hit. 
---
TSE minigun. 2 physical rounds and 2 explosions per ‚Äòshot‚Äô. 4 hits per round if you‚Äôre lined up. If everything hit, you could theoretically kill someone through slap damage in 5 rounds. The minigun empties a clip in less than a minute. 
---
Slap damage deaths happen. They‚Äôre just never the 1-shots people think they are. They can happen hella fast, though. 
---
Have you ever been harassed by a Swing Speed unarmed build? Watch your HP. 
---
You try only having a few hours on the weekend to run a ‚Äòlimited‚Äô event and see how many drops you have.  
---
Not complaining, mind you, as my schedule is my problem, not Bethesda‚Äôs.  It just means I have zero chance of limited drops.  I‚Äôm happy I was able to run it 5 times.
---
What's better is that slap damage for CAMPs is removed, too - just in time for player vending in two weeks, when we'll *want* people to visit our CAMPs!
---
Good to hear.
---
2 caps for the handmade.
---
Also "signs and letters" implies more than 1 sign
---
Ah sorry my bad ü§ó yeah I have noticed they seem to mostly all be around alcohol so yeah agree they should have some normal ones too
---
Not sure if it was mentioned, the 2 layer staircase from FO4.
---
I'm ready to farm 2k 3k legendarys items if i can craft a powered assasin sentinel heavy combat armor set
---
If you break down the top hat do you get the plans for it?
---
Hey man. First off I generally disagree with the idea of single character refresh, and I downvote all such posts, but this I will upvote because its not the typical hypocritical bullshit these contain, what you wrote had none of that bullshit.
---
My concern with fresh start and why I think its generally bad idea is that it will not increase the amount of fairness whatsoever. Mainly, those who took holidays and would start grinding today would anyway be at severe disadvantage when compared to the rest, then in few months we'd be exactly where we are. I think the extent to which dupping exist has been reduced but not removed. I'm pretty sure I got on my hands an easy inventory rollback bug that could be used to regain items you gave away, and I did not receive any confirmation from Bethesda that it has been fixed, reported at the end of patch6.
---
Why I upvote? Because you are absolutely right that the first hour after a fresh start would be utterly amazing, with people scrambling to get their exp ASAP. This is why I propose an alternate approach to what you'd like, that would actually be fair for the majority of the players, as it would take the "initiation date" irrelevant in the equation. If they make it a seasonal thing, and if we had such fresh start every three months, then what we'd get would be actual fair situation. Otherwise, the only group that would benefit from separating the character pool would be nolifes.
---
I've been offered 15k in the past for it lol but never sold as I liked it. Just want a new look now. I'm now setting prices just awaiting bids and good offers. 
---
Stairs that could fold up into the roof would be lit!!!
---
People have been driving the price down so much on here though that it's almost silly trying to sell anything anymore. You can get 1400 caps a day from vendors alone and people are reluctant to pay above 3k for a 3* weapon with a good roll. Seems a little backwards to me. Everyone knows the RNG is terrible. 
---
Bro, you gotta whale out on an atom shop door. Nice place though!
---
I got 450hours and killed over hundred of ppl, if there was way to do high amound of damage throught slap, i would know it.
---
Sorry my bad, xbox. 
---
Oh well I definitely don‚Äôt have 15k caps lol
---
I'm on the other hands 100% that bethesda specified these three things and nothing else
---
Wait now it's for xbone, no desire then.
---
Every time I go to a vendor they are out of caps smh
---
In a 4 hour sitting I can make 5000caps from Pvp, 1400 caps a day lol. 
---
Are you on PC? Happened to me tonight too. Someone said one of the enemies must be stuck but I ran all around and couldn't find any :(
---
Exactly those two things. I loved being able to use two half stairs with a small square floor between to make a sort of curved staircase in FO4. It was a thing of beauty. And being able to have ceilings that were a wall and a half high was grand.
---
Also, the two-tile staircases need to stack in a normal way. I've heard people say there's an exploit to make that work (I have no clue), but they literally look like they were designed specifically to do that, and it should simply work. Snap one on top and done.
---
I said from vendors alone. I didnt say you were capped at 1400 a day. 
---
Additional Question 4: Will we be able to repurchase the game on Steam and link our accounts/keep our characters?
---
Damn i always wanted to be a liquor miner
---
I am sorry and not flexin, but after TSE nerf, just before my group stopped playing, we killed SBQ in 2minutes after event started. So you may think you are professional, but um, you are just casual, not offence. Happy Hunting to you too!
---
However your 5000 from PVP furthers my point. No reason for people sit here and offer 2k for a 3* weapon with a decent to good roll. 
---
I know, just saying fuck vendor runs. 
---
Ah, ok, legendary farming attempt.
---
Really? I got it once and ate it and threw some outside my door. I think only thing I'm missing from 35 runs is the Balloons.
---
Thanks for the tips. Are you on console or PC? I have it both on PC and PS4 so not sure which one I'll do this playthrough on
---
I hate building tall buildings in 76. If you want an efficient staircase, i.e. all in one column, you have to really watch that gaping hole when you're walking around or even going down the stairs. It's less of an issue with Bird Bones, but it still blows.
---
Checked his profile, hes on xbox.

---
All raider vendors are tied
---
Enclave bunker is it's own

Harpers ferry is it's own

Watoga station is it's own
---
Watoga shopping center is it's own

I cant wait to hop onto a fresh account and get started on survival
---
This is very probable 
---
I started a new character yesterday and boosted him up a couple levels, he'll be my main for survival.
---
I want to take the new mode in with full immersion so surviving the overpowered players is gonna be an extra factor.
---
Good news for every who doesnt wear a god armor is that there are often neglected pieces of armor that will be worth a lot once the majority learns their value and that can be still bought for pennies. I bought four such pieces for like 10k total in last two days. I'll wait until people will learn about it some more and plan to make my findings public. Once these items gain the caps value appropriate for their combat value, their prices will skyrocket. I am talking about armor with sentinel/assassin perks, but with a prefix that is so neglected that when you see listings of powertraders you will probably never find them yet. The greatest advantage in PvP is knowledge, and then knowledge applied to a build. Keep open mind and research stuff. 
---
I just want stairs that lock  to one side of a 4x4 so I can build a proper staircase....oh and a stair to doorway fix without having to do trickery to get doorways on a 3 stair flight.
---
Yea but for lower level guys/people who cant hang with those who have been around since launch and have great gear it's a good way to make caps. Along with events. 
---
This is pretty awesome :) As someone who'll never get out that way IRL now I kinda feel like I was actually there!  
---
Have to admit though, a final night Fasnacht dance and music-a-thon would have been amazing!
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good idea. Have their camp show up as wanted! I bet that would solve the problem pretty quick. 
---
Good luck, that was the last one I needed for the platinum trophy, finally got it 2 days ago.
---
Not up to bethesda 
---
I think you mean with the 1x2 staircase. Supposedly there's an exploit that will allow you to do it. I have my own workaround but it's not very elegant.
---
Thanks this is very useful
---
It was worth even before, if you like this kind of games and don't care about people who complain about everything.
---

Oh The great Mothman rolls by my house 2x yesterday.   I feel lucky. 
---
YES! THIS! THIS right HERE!
---
I'm distinctly less than SPECIAL when it comes to strength (thanks, Bird Bones!) and about 1/3 of my carrying capability is soaked up by my two sleek and streamlined sniper rifles. That doesn't make much sense.
---
I'm guessing it's so they have a higher cost to use in V.A.T.S. so I can't just go full-on John Wick with a sniper rifle but really... they're mostly wood! :D
---
It at least let us build floors based on walls.  
---
Y'know I wondered the same. I own a g3, modded with a scope and with a full 20 round magazine it's about 12 pounds. I guess I should have bought a minigun instead. üòé
---
That said, in game perhaps they should have a perk or add it to another perk to reduce the weight of rifles. Because apparently we are adding lead weights to them. :p
---
Would have a look at the road map
---
A cutlet, meat balls and peas! Lovely meal.
---
Brotherhood prefix or bloodied? A bloodied gets stronger as your life goes down, idea for unyielding nerd rage type builds.

Thanks for the build tips, I generally don't bother with her since her drop table is still pretty much garbage, but if they ever fix that I will keep this in mind.
---

---
Never knew of a brotherhood prefix. Now you peeked my interest lol I only knew of brotherhood paints and underarmor.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the legendary rolling pins or canes. What the F*** ü§¨ ?
---
You're welcome. It's the easiest way to build caps up. Takes a couple days but in a week you can have over 10k just from the vendors alone. 
---
So its not worth all that much. I heard unyielding is one of the best effects.
---
I agree. AI is programmed to play the game as intended. Real people just want to cause grief and not care. I do hope they all head to the new server. Or at least make the pacifist mode an actual pacifist mode, where perhaps your camp is protected. 
---
üëç
---
Yeah same here
---
Because fuck you, that's why.
---
Yes I'm all for this idea. Stairs half the lenght as the current ones are also needed badly.
---
I basically had someone kill me at the Fassnatcht event and the worst part is they never even went wanted. 
---
Worked for me
---
If people play 100 times they should get all rare masks, if it was fair. I'll say again, 1 in a 1000000 isn't just rare, at that point it is literally gambling. They could get a fine.
---
Thats good to hear
---
I had the same kind of experience with the same guy! The only difference is that he walked up to me and asked me to stop walking and that was it. I find that the biggest insult of all of that he didn‚Äôt even know what to say to me. He just stood there looking at me! Believe me, I was hurt and offended after it happened as well but you will get through this, I certainly did. However, some nights I lay awake thinking about what happened...

It just makes me appreciate even more the detail that the ladies and gents developing the Fallout worlds put into them.

---
PSN is shadowman9908, feel free to hit me up
---
No you wouldn't. You played 450 hours, did you accidentally got into the dev room? No because you did not attach a debugger to the game process. But there are tons of people out there who do, and there are developers who know what they're doing not just idiot childs who set the game speed higher in cheat engine and copied some code piece they saw in a thread. After the pocketed armor bug it's clear that bethesda has no idea how to develop an online game and I'm sure that their server/client communication is a piece of crap despite the updates and there are people skilled enough to use it, even though you don't hear from them here, they exists. 
---
Can you store caps though? I don't remember being able to do so.
---
Unfortunately no
---
Are you on xbox? I have multiples of the common masks and a ton of the plans if you want a few. Let me know!
---
give them to a friend and transfer them.to another character
---
I unlocked a brotherhood sniper rifle which I can craft it seems like it is a regular hunting rifle but comes pre modded with recon scope hardened recieved silencer etc. It was my go to gun until I picked up some legendary lever actions.
---
You can get a good trade for it alot of the time
---
Sucks all the fun out of working on a camp, knowing it is temporary or you‚Äôll have to move it again. 
---
Attacking a camp should have dire results, not a slap on the wrist. It hurts the real players trying to play the game as intended. 
---
Oh that makes sense
---
Now I am part of the young lives so I have seen some real military power... but this.... this is unthinkable! Sorry my friend, but not a chance of survival. 
---
Not that I have engaged in anything pvp or have tried to shoot anyone (I'm only level 8) but this is good news and also what does capturing a warehouse really do? Is it for resources or something? 
---
Oh good maybe I can get something useful
---
This is exactly what I have too! I don't have a picture of inside yet but the bottom floor is a bar with brew station , pool table and bar chairs.

---
that's such a dumb theory with little to no corroborating evidence tbh
---
This right here üëç
---
its great for bloody builds. but they typically run &gt;20% of total HP so they're prone to getting 1 shot by like everything. Until you acquire sentinel/cavalier (15% dmg reduction while standing still/sprinting)  
---
1\* stuff sells for 100-400ish caps. Ive seen single pieces of uny/sent sell for 30k+.  
---
Ive got an 4/5 complete matched CA set and 3/5 marine armor set. I've had exactly 0 inquiries on them.
---
Lol punishment? 
---
...but they can't be dropped either.
---
the toxic valley is so nice. i got mine just a bit east of grafton near a pond amd i dont see myself moving for awhile
---
I really want to go here! What system are you on?
---
I‚Äôd like to see a legendary melee fishing pole for the manglers.
---
no
---
Well 100-400 caps is better then nothing. I‚Äôd rather not have my health constantly at 20%
---
Yeah it did not take 2 full hours.
---
The white line is condition above 100%.  When you craft items and repair items, certain perks allow you to go above 100%, up to 200% max.
---
"Hi, I'm OP and welcome to Jackass!" 
---
PC, but thanks.  I likely won‚Äôt get to play again for a couple of weeks.  
---
That sounds too good to be true, but great if it is. You mean like collect the broken camp them immediately put it back down where it was? Fully repaired? I‚Äôll have to try it. 
---
Repairing an entire camp just seems like a huge waste of resources I spent weeks collecting. 
---
Thing is, i would prefer a normal gunfight rather than a battle between someone who just stand still with a god rng armor sentinel assassin versus a full vats build when you don't even aim anymore, but i guess we won't have that as long as legendary rng prefixes works in pvp
---
Looks like it.
---
What no?
---
Anyways, just checked it. There's no way to transfer, store, drop caps. It's on the wiki too. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bottlecap_(Fallout_76) 
---
''Like in Fallout 4, caps cannot be stored or dropped.''
---
This is completely normal and actually common. Players who still learn their wasteland paths often attribute things to wrong causes. Level means little when it comes to actual power level, and the most powerful characters are usually between 50 and 70 and around 200. The first type of are these who created PvP-focused characters as an alt, and have full gear obtained with main character, and their build skip the QoL and crafting perks in favour of combat power. The latter group are people who PvP with their mains and generally ignore XP in their playthrough as they don't really want to make it more expensive to play by having high level. I am yet to see a PvP-dangerous character that is level 350, most of people who had such created themselves an alt after having a fight where they killed 8 times, died twice, and lost 200 caps as a result. The truth is that TSE aint so powerful as people think they are, and I guess 80% of the 100+ players by now should have a gun to one-shot sloth. Each time his health gone down not in one shot, there were probably 5+ people capable of landing such blow who didn't do it.
---
Got back to the game last Saturday or so, simply due to my intrigue as to what might've changed. Been lugging around a lot of scrap as I don't want to get rid of it (hoarder mentality, but I've restricted myself to only get specific mats), so I'm looking forward to the player vendor stuff. 
---
I mostly play solo, currently lvl 38 and kinda introverted, and I've yet to launch a nuke. I mean, it's good that people want to help at times, but most of the time I'd rather explore on my own. The new questing and crafting will probably be my time sink as well
---
The only Brotherhood weapon is the Brotherhood Recon Rifle. It's a reward schematic for joining the Brotherhood.  Just a modified Combat Rifle (it might be a hunting rifle as its base?) But it's already fully modded and can be crafted even for lvl 1s
---
You‚Äôd have to know someone to provoke them. Hence, the random stranger comment ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i said.you transfer caps to another character via a friend
---
If you can get it cheap.
---
Yeah someone have me a level 20 brotherhood recon rifle. Its a modded hunting rifle.
---
Can you still only turn in 1 per day or can i rinse and repeat per tech data found?
---
We need to start a witch hunt and find juice head!(jk)
---
The problem is rifles don't have any weight reduction perk cards. Everything else has one even the shotgun has it. Why can't they change or add to a perk card weight reduction to a perk card.  
---
Ah interesting, did not know that. Bethesda should block that area off as non-buildable if that is the case because I am sure most players have no idea this is a thing. 
---
could not play over the last two weeks due to bug. played the first time yesterday and joined the event. managed to kill myself using a TSE on a bug.   respawned on another map. crap
---
Next time keep the lamp on
---
this game made me really interested in visiting West Virginia someday.
---
*Slime ball flies through the air*
---
That was really nice of them, man! It can only be crafted. So they weren't just getting rid of their junk, they made it for you
---
If you'd ask me what would my personal perfect wasteland be, I'd say: first, no legendary prefixes whatsover, then, full loot drop upon death, then, new character pool because of completely separate economy and mathemathics. But no legendary prefixes in PvP is something we won't get so lets concentrate where we are.
---
We need a weight perk card for guns!
---
Why don't you sell duplicates?
---
Then if so, how?
---
You are not safe from pvp with pacifist on.
---
You STILL take damage if you choose not to fight.
---
About the same difficulty as literally all the other obvious flaws and bugs that are being ignored in favor of working on the next Atomic Shop installment. 
---
Lots of console players have mics, they are in parties tho

its something we really need to have

It's about 35 on the Humble Store right now.

If you have full hp, enemy player will have to broke one and use another weapon to kill you.
---
I hope that is the case! 
---
There are random encounters on the roads between Flatwoods and Point Pleasant and between Point Pleasant and Tyler County Dirt track.
---
Nice pics! üòÅüëç
---
Yeah they were the nicest people I‚Äôve met. They asked if I needed anything and I said I needed a bit of adhesive to fix my armor and they crafted me new armor and gave me adhesive. They also gave me the brotherhood rifle after they saw I was rocking a barely modded hunting rifle.
---
Move your CAMP station around until you find a good spawn point.  It‚Äôs dependent on the station location.  I used to spawn underwater until I moved mine to the opposite edge of my camp and now I pop up in my front yard.
---
*Insult bot walks up* Demon! Demon!
---
you need to create another character...get a friend to sell you an item.for xx amount of caps then logon with your new character and sell them.an item.for the same amount of caps..voila the caps are now stored on a different character
---
Dude I would really like a wall that comes to a point. I am so tired of not being able to taper three walls up
---
Oh trading, alright. That's useful.
---
I have no idea how not having the game on steam is a punishment as you're losing absolutely nothing.
---
Thanks peoples. See you in there. 
---
Most stuff with a light for your camp just seemed lazily slapped together.
---
 Those advertisement signs have a giant light in the center so when it's on you can't even see the picture or read what it is.
---
 Same with the arrows I paid for with atoms.
---
Huge light in the center. Lazy ass devs.
---
I just looking at the bald spot on the top of your head!
---
I turn them in 1 at a time as soon as I find them, and regularly do it on the same server, I think you only need to reload the location (i.e fast travel away and back again) to allow you turn in again. 
---
 The only time its not allowed me to turn one in it is when a friend gave me one bit of tech data at Camp Venture after I had already turned one in. We both fast travelled away, we swapped it back and forth, I fast travelled back and it accepted it. 
---
All anecdotal, it could simply be a short timer on it.  I can fast travel and submit the next one maybe 3 minutes after handing one in.
---
 Hope this helps 
---
looks like the same sort of spawn hack GTA 5 users would use to spawn weapons or money, they drop it onto someone but fallout doesnt auto collect so odds are they rolled down hill.
---
I literally was killed three times at the end of the parade. Two guys running unarmed melee killed me while I was taking a group shot. I never turn off pacifist, never claim workshops. The only thing I could think of is my electrically charged mutation? But I never instigated anything. 
---
There is one thing that is beneficial to do, but not super-preferred, so you are discouraged to do it by this hinderance.
---
There are certain craftable hats that you can craft cheaply and sell at around 30 caps each. They don't stack so we won't use em as currency.
---
I tried that, but the building design doesnt allow for that, and the lack of extra pieces limits that at the moment. I'm farming blueprints looking for those. It's my new mission. 
---
Helvetia is a real town with fasnacht :)
---
Can get it by scrapping for the arms or torso.
---
Im making a gangster build and im using an explosive 44 as one of my mains. Im relatively accurate so i only use vats with melee (bc enemies like to warp around you)
---
what's the name of your outfit?
---
Awesome indeed :)
---
Is it out ?
---
Awesome ideas! Make it part of the game with strategy, choices and consequences. Hope Bethesda is listening. Or perhaps they could hire you as a consultant? :)
---
I once reloaded 40 into my two shot dragon.
---
Except one guy in a team can claim your workshop and the other can tp to you and one shot you with his explosive combat shotgun.
---
Although if you don't have workshops this can't happen too often.
---
Update goes live at 10am central 
---
I server hop Watoga.
---
You can usually find a few legendary bots there.
---
I'm totally fine with pvp in workshops. But I should also be able to abandon a workshop if it's being contested. Instead, I get some ass that hunts me down, then waits for the takeover to fail then re-instigates. Basically repeating untill I hop servers or quit. Its infuriating.
---
Agreed, the longest beard in the game is like 3 weeks worth of growth :(
---
I fully agree with you.  
---
This is non-sense, 9k caps for some stuff , but then you can get better stuff for free just by finding the plans.  
---
Bethesda your value scale system is broken.  
---
Also, yah, I use the letters on a panel to sorta communicate ( since there's no fracking text chat in a 2019 game thx bethesda), 2 words of it takes half the camp budget.
---
There are songs that I really do love and I don‚Äôt want to lose from the old playlist like ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be nice‚Äù, ‚Äúpraise the lord and pass the ammunition‚Äù and ‚Äúcountry roads‚Äù
---
Shudders* seriously though games like ark feel like a commitment at times, not a game, you can‚Äôt pick it up and start playing then get back into it whenever nearly as easily as most. Which makes the griefing all the more asinine.
---
That was a cute little page of it, but I kinda wanna know more about them lol.
---
A vault dweller venturing out into the wasteland with high hopes of rebuilding civilization, only to see how much it has crumbled, and lost hope for the future. Plummeting into drug addiction and alcohol abuse, wandering the savage divide mostly. along the way met rose. Found out about the raiders. Realized their way of life was the only way to go, got a taste for blood and loved it. More of a chaotic neutral than a griefer in terms of playing. My character just looks crazy and fucked up lol 
---
omg stop, i love david LOL
---
Because right now I don't think there's enough demand for them.  
---
Most people have the complete set, maybe they'll get value after 6 months...  
---
Also, I have 5 characters (max number for an account) with max caps.  
---
What level are you? Have you thought about trying to farm lead if you have excavator power armor and go to Lucky Hole mine you can get 250-300 lead ore a 4-5 server hops and you will have over a 1000 ore. Now head over to 
---
Mountain Side Bed and breakfast just a little south of White Spring there are two Yao Guai that spawn every server hop by the train cars at the bottom of the cliff kill them and take the acid and springs. 2 lead ore and 1 acid make 5 lead. 
---
We're getting some eventually but from what I can tell from "previews" (just take a look in the actual game - scroll through options on the staircase that takes up two foundations) they have garbage chicken wire floors which makes them way less appealing (I'd like to see chicken wire and real flooring)
---
A post from a couple of hours ago. Guy said he was in Helvetia and they just appeared and started rolling down the hill. 
---
Weirder still considering they‚Äôre an atom shop item. 
---
I'm on PS4. There are a few smaller skellingtons every now and again but I do t think the game needs tiny baby skellingtons lol. that's a bit much 
---
To those who have seen this, was there anything else on the server that was strange?
---
For example, were you the only one there? Could your friends see that you were online? Were there several blast zones at once?
---
I wonder what's more funny to them.. a high level 3* enemy dropping a drill or what I got from killing a 3* level 60 ish near cranberry bog yesterday, Level 10 3* leather armour. 
---
So a level 10 is gonna be out near cranberry bog slaying high level 3* legendaries. Sure!
---
I have a full grasp on in game mechanics and I have died through slap damage before.  I used to think the posts were BS until it happened to me too. 
---
I read somewhere that confetti pile is rare but I have obtained this and learnt it. Is this true? I spend all my caps on plans for my camp and most of my time building and tweaking so glad to know that I might have stumbled across something good
---
It was a nice event but a little too crowded for me. Every time I joined the event I was stuck with 10+ other players and barely got a chance to participate (with the exception of lighting the fire, since most people didn‚Äôt know how that worked...). 
---
The combination of grinding Biv quests and alcohol related dailies has made me become a damn traveling bartender. Yesterday my friends asked if I had any spare spirits for the daily, that's when I realized I had a problem and triple digit whiskey...
---
4) it's alcohol spiked with lemonade, pretty brutal stuff 
---
Not gonna lie I done this a few times when you grinded this event 100+ times all for no reward you get bored of it. If I saw a few lvl 100s there I would just sit it out too.
---
I would suggest doing Horde events. I do them the moment one appears on the map, the horde boss is 99% likely a 3\* legendary enemy. You can also check events like AWOL Armaments which have a 3\* enemy at the end every time. You can also find alot of 1\*-3\* legendary Supermutants at WesTek Research Center and many 1\*-3\* Legendary Protectrons running around the town of Watoga.
---
Usually if it's a wall or to I say whatever but someone got my decontamination shower. Took me more than 2hrs to rebuild my house after moving it. One could fight back but it your not built for pvp it's a lost hope. 
---
nothing read about it. but it could be possible that the game will get challenging in every aspect. let's see. i'm also waiting for the release...
---
I've almost bought it - still missing the stove, so when I got it, I'll buy the skin.
---
Sure, but if they server hop they stay wanted and their CAMP still could stay marked. I suppose the game would have to offer some other incentive to nuke alternate locations other than just some bounty caps.
---
well it does say in the description that you need to have the plans learned, it‚Äôs just a skin and not a new item
---
i will definitely start fresh.
---
I know Bethesda is great with details in their games, but it is crazy how they pretty much exactly copied all the buildings in the video and plopped them into the game.
---
That's true. I guess the game would have to get the safe zones removed ;)
---
As much as I don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs not for realism - it‚Äôs for balance. We‚Äôre talking about a fictional world where you have a mini nuclear catapult for chrisakes 
---
Doh!!!
---
Captain Dumbass strikes again!
---
Cheers!
---
Found the shill
---
I've done it 120+ times and I'm lvl 246 but I always join in, I'm no moral cruiser believe me but this is fairly shit. 
---
I have a 90% reduced weight handmade. Want to know how much it weighs?
---
14.65 lbs. 
---
Because every mod you add to it, adds 1-4 lbs. Want that new scope? Bam, 2 lbs. Want that shiny new reciever? Bam, 4 lbs...
---
You're not wrong. I'm between 14-19 and I can confirm that. Mainly applies to Xbox tho
---
Thanks for the tip. I have excavator but not high enough level to wear it yet; it was a gift. I just have so much .38 that I really don‚Äôt need and my main gun is a 10mm pistol.
---
Grinding Biv‚Äôs dailies and Fauschnaut means I‚Äôm always drunk at the parade üòÇ
---
Definitely agree maybe someday
---
The event is easy as is theresa no reason to sit out. If someone is just standing there and not helping for the first couple min I assume the game froze or stuff isn't loading in for them. It happens with the queen alot 
---
Whenever I go up to the insult bot it NEVER says anything and just follows me around..maybe its too scared?
---
Explanation: There are screws in scissors, but they are not retrievable without damaging them. On the other side of the screwhead there's a stopper to keep it in place and while dismantling the scissors you render the srew useless by damaging the top.
---
Definitely agree fingers crossed maybe someday
---
You could argue that is one interpretation of the word Rare.  
---
10 EDT 
---
There is a difference 
---
You caa now get the BoS mods as an item reward from the Grafton Day event.
---
Razorgrain...I hate you.  You make me rage.  My OCD kicks in and I want to rip you off your floating, invisible pedestal and throw you in the fire.  
---
Why do you mock me?
---
You probably forgot to turn pacifist on -- I bet you initiated combat by accident.
---
Nah this one was just sat there changing headgear, like I said I'm no moral crusader but jesus this has to be shit right? 
---
Whilst this annoys me as well, I have 3 weapon weight reduction armour pieces, deep pocketed on every armour piece and strong back 2 and I carry a pipe rifle, laser rifle, handmade, lever action, pump action, grognaks axe, ski sword and auto grenade launcher and have around 70 pounds spare weight. If you want to carry more junk/chems/ammo you can get weight reduction armour for those pieces and also have perk cards to reduce the weight of those items. The only tim it's an issue this way is when you step into power armour and lose the weight reduction armour effects
---
Bru this town looks the same in game they really did make a amazing map it really is wonderful 
---
I did same thing pal hahaha 
---
12k for the aa Gatling plasma
---
This is wrong
---
It's actually 10 EDT- which is 7 PDT 
---
PST isnt even used right now 
---
I play on  ps4 I can craft you 1000 10mm.
---
Not unusual, people tend to do it with chameleon armor as well
---
I do on one of my guns. It certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt especially for your more beefier foes. 
---
holding 20k offer
---
Troll griefer. 
---
Shotguns don‚Äôt have armor pen perks, heavy weapons don‚Äôt benefit much from luck of the draw, melee doesn‚Äôt have stagger perks, pistols don‚Äôt have stagger or reload speed perks. Every weapon class is missing something and it‚Äôs intentional.
---
Hotel = Trivago
---
What I was thinking about was during the Fallout 76 presentation when it was revealed that there would be nukes and players would be able to use them, was that they would use them on each other.  Being a multi player game, my first thought was that the point of this would be to nuke other players who pissed you off.  Instead, people just nuke the fissure pretty much every time, and other player's CAMPs are hidden and not even identifiable by player if you happen to run across them in the game world. I also keep seeing posts about griefers that randomly level other player's CAMPs, and was thinking of a way to make that fun for the victim. The nuking aspect of the game is hugely disappointing as is, and I wish that there were good and satisfying reasons (like revenge) to decide to head into the silos other than the possibility of the SBQ dropping a nice weapon.
---
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
---
Hitler?!?! I‚Äôm so sick of that guy!
---
You may have killed yourself with explosives or something, but nobody went wanted because nobody else can kill you during the parade. Try. 
---
Nothing happens. You dont even touch them, much less hurt them 
---
That would be fantastic!
---
Why do you need it. I have like 200 i don't have a use for
---
You played Fallout 4? You seen the mod KS Hairdos? Yeah... If modders can do such an amazing job for free then y tf can't bethesda give me long hair
---
Is that left leg and right arm?
---
Maybe they had an urgent phone call or desperately needed a pooh ?
---
I have a beautiful red stove in my camp 
---
Ohhh, I would expect it from Bog region, not Toxic Valley, but good to know - Grafton day is very fast and easy event.
---
And waste it? Pffft. Lightweight
---
There is a chance of getting loot, currently the grind is for BOS T60 Paint. If you are on PC and don't need them I'd happily pay 50c each for those. 
---
I know it's not excuse, but I prefer a dude sit-looting at such event, than the 170+ level dude that stole my 60 level toon hard acquired poseidon workshop x@
---
Chinese knock offs of the ak and sks are actually quite good. 
---
Would be nice if it was tied to the actual date
---
When you need to take a dump you need to take a dump, but they were just sat there changing headgear... The possibilities are endless.. 
---
Haha one pour ain‚Äôt a waste, got tons of nukashine to go around. For the culture 
---
Troll griefer. Quit the game. Stop playing. Go away.
---
Chances are they have caps stored on a friend or another character, so somebody‚Äôs going to collect a 10 cap bounty they paid 27 caps to get to because they thought they‚Äôd get 1.5k. Usually when I‚Äôve hunted large bounties (400+) they never actually had the caps to back it up. I‚Äôm not going to waste the ammo, the travel costs, or the time to kill them or nuke them. In the end, the bounty system is a game mechanic, not a punishment. No matter what we want it to be, that‚Äôs currently what it is
---
You can get a microphone for less than four dollars.
---
Nah. I've seen someone who was getting attacked by a whole squad and while he did have to heal there was absolutely no way after seeing what I saw that I'll ever believe in one-hit-kill-through-slap-damage.
---
Dang. I have an extra but I'm on ps4
---
I have done the event so many times that, yes it get boring (especially when I don't really need another witch mask.) If there are already a bunch of people doing the parade (Enough that I'm sure the level 5-10 supermutants won't be a problem.) I have hopped up on a roof and crouched while I go make a sandwich, allowing the event to be completed by the others.
---
Some people just can‚Äôt let go once they think they‚Äôve been betrayed by a company 
---
it‚Äôs one of the five common masks, not really rare at all. i have like 5-10 of it just like all other masks
---
Vic's nighttime job is to inform people about daylight savings time.  He works from 8PDT pm until 6 EST am, and that comment gave him both PTSD and PTDD.
---
Here‚Äôs a little tip I use to get the letters to line up 100% every time. It‚Äôs more work but it‚Äôs worth it. First decide on where you want the words and build a wall to the left of that wall. Now remove the wall you want the letters on so only the left wall remains. On the left wall, on the far right side of it, place any letter and attach another one to it. The second letter should be floating where the other wall used to be. Now remove the left wall and keep adding letters to the second letter until you‚Äôre where you want to be when you start your word. Spell your word and delete any letters in front of it that you don‚Äôt need. Now replace the original wall. They should be lined up perfectly. Hope this makes sense. 
---
The reason is simple, it seems they haven't thought about it.   
---
Same way they arbitrary set the rare drop rate at 0.03% lmao.
---
Ok I've just never seen it
---
I want to make an outlaw build with an explosive 44 for the new survival mode, but idk if it is good in pvp. From what you‚Äôve seen, is it usable in pvp
---
We want you to quit the game.
---
For xbox
---
I was akfing in every game, if there was enought people doing it, i would stay, maybe help little bit, mostly killing small animals because not much people know where they spawned. If there was not much people i would server hop, because i failed some times when i was actualy trying due to be only one doing his job. 
---
can you tell me how workshops trigger pvp? i havent played the game much.
---
I have dozens of asylum worker hats in all colors and they don't stack either.
---
Congrats. 
---
It's not rare. The five "common" masks that have been dropping for everybody are the Giant, Soldier, Witch, Owl, and Toothy Man. Plenty of those masks going around, although with the event ending their value is sure to go up. 
---
This is a good idea except maybe with a limit, like you can rejoin the last server if you rejoin within 60 seconds?
---
They used to be sold by the Grafton vendors before the plan patch.
---
I might have those for you. I‚Äôm at work till 5 tho. I want that AA death claw gauntlet lol
---
I kinda want to do this but I also don‚Äôt want to be an ass
---
I'm referring to the posts I see here where someone (or a team) completely levels another players' CAMP for no discernible reason and is wanted as a result. I don't think there is much benefit to doing this other than just to be a jerk, since as far as I know you don't get anything by breaking into a CAMP and can't steal their stuff. In PvP you might damage a few parts of a CAMP, but I would think most of the time you are aiming at the player and not the building, so I think CAMP destruction will appear as deliberate. Maybe, someone would have to destroy a certain number of items or a certain percentage of the CAMP to trigger the wanted level.
---
So another idea, if a team destroys a CAMP, all of their CAMPs get marked and the next nuke that is launched could get a MIRV option to take out all team member's CAMPs on the map at once.
---
You could kill through slap damage, you just can't one hit kill through slap damage. The very idea of slap damage has the idea it can be "worked through" built right in. Otherwise there'd be no way to get a bounty for "murder".
---
I saw a pair of scissors with a Phillips screw, not a rivet.
---
I'm no different, no point in wasting bullets 
---
It has trouble with the lvl 50 little chinese robots and lvl 70 scorched. Havent done much pvp with i but i imagine its not that good. I have +50 damage resis as well so maybe itll be decent
---
I'm not sure you're getting this... It's (1500+800) *4+2
---
Not what you said.
---
I play on ps4 so i can't really speak for pc players but usually they won't bother you. There are a lot of quests in morgontown that multiple people can do and get rewards for like feed the people and back on the beat a lot of people like to do those quests to try to get plans for weapons and armor. Even if people start attacking you they will only do slap damage and as long as you keep your health up all you have to do is exit the server. Once they relese survival mode other players won't even be able to damage you at all in adventure mode. Just remember the only thing that players will get if they do manage to kill you is any junk items so go to train stations your camp or even red rocket service stations and deposit your junk into your stash box that way you won't lose much of you are killed.
---
You must have taken some of my ammo slots. My Quad Handmade used to hold 80 rounds, now it's glitched to 70 for some reason and I can't get it to go back.
---
That's alot. Most I had was 400 and that was from buying it from a player for 1,200 caps.
---
Regardless if they felt betrayed or not, unless the Steam servers and Bethesda.net servers for the game are separate which is highly unlikely as it would be easier for them just to require a Bethesda login on the main menu like it already does 90% of the time I launch the game you aren't losing any thing.
---
True
---
Check CD keys, the standard edition is literally 8.99
---
Well that sucks.
---
If you lose any caps, you were PvP flaged = mutation flagged you as pvp active.
---
If you did not lose caps, they hited you so many times it actualy killed you.
---
I'm gonna be honest and say I don't want this. From what I hear console player base seems to be a lot more griefer based and I don't need that in my game. PC (at least for me) seems to have a much lower instance of assholes and a more helpful community.  In my over 700 hours of game play I've never once been griefed.
---
I love whiskey!  I don't wear power armor so whiskey and bufftats are great when I'm overencumbered farming and can't find a workbench
---
That‚Äôs the best part though 
---
Go to the Fo76 sub: if ur on phone press the [‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢] button near the top right. Select "change user flair" and enjoy.
---
How about Mr. Prize bot randomly and rarely giving any rare item including things that have been removed from the ATOM store? That would make it like a lottery where people might actually be excited to find the prize bot instead of rolling their eyes and running away.
---
Shit that is such a good deal and would get me my tsaa combat rifle but alas I'm ps4.
---
Yeah ! Piece by piece lets make appalachia great again! 
---
Hmm never knew that. Thanks for the info.
---
i got 6
---
This can lead on to my support of the idea that each workshop will automatically place down what you had before so people are more influenced to go out and claim workshops as it can add practically another touch of design to the game 
---
i'm at work till 7/7:30 GMT as well ;) let me know, i am looking for those in front of caps
---
Well I have some beautiful Fasnacht confetti. 
---
Looks great...... when you can see it!
---
They should also fix the Energy armor penetration. As it is Anti-Armor does nothing to reduce your targets energy resistance. Same goes for ‚Äústabilized‚Äù, which is supposed to lower enemies armor by 45% while in power armor, which currently does not apply to energy resistance 
---
Even op buzzblade take tones of time to kill you thru slap. Make video if you think you can kill someone with 5hits to full hp.
---
All of the major bugs that were present at launch have long since been fixed. The game is a lot more stable now that all of the big cheaters have been banned. Nowadays the new patches are all new content and quality of life improvements, adding things the community have been asking for. it's good stuff. 
---
I spotted that guy too, 2:52. Dude must‚Äôve been stoked when 76 put up the Fasnacht event lol
---
Xb1
---
There was a 1 in 3 chance, RNJesus strikes again. :( 
---
Oh you can talk scorchbeast lol
---
Yes. I prize my canned coffee for those long runs across the map as I chug them to keep my action points up. It would be great to be able to grow coffee beans and make our own.
---
Looking to buy or trade for one? 
---
Dude! Pre built defenses ready to go? Sign me up
---
How cheap we talking?
---
Thou must hath been honoured to meet with such a hallowed deity, then ye of unworthy faith must hath angered thy lord and brought upon his reckoning. Praise be to ato..uhhh...MOTHMAN!
---
OK ONE MORE TIME, THANKS FOR DOWNVOTES BUT CHECK THIS "took 100 of my caps" YOU GOT NO CAPS FOR MURDERING SOMEONE. L2P NOOBS AND STOP SPREADING THIS HOAX.
---
People *try* it versus the Queen, but since that event actually gets harder the more people are there, most at least make an effort. Even lameass melee-only guys like me can be on mob spawn duty when she's flying around.
---
I don't *mind* it for Fasnacht, since tbh there's usually so many people I hardly get a chance to help once the parade starts even when I'm trying. And it's an all-levels event with purely cosmetic rewards. But if there's not many people, then they should start playing the game instead of sitting on their duff.
---
There are sooo many items that have screws. I'm getting ready to cleanse my 3 characters of screws due to hitting max weight. 
---
I would assume the disconnect happens because of an error, so they wouldn't likely have what you most wanted anymore?
---
Like when I reload and server hop, my gun is mysterious unloaded and I reload again.  A few seconds was lost.
---
Still... I have been 90% thru a run, been disconected, and would be happy to regain even 50% of it.
---
I have learned to loot legendaries as I go and not come back for them...  lost 3  legendary mole miner supervisors once.  Remote flew like a bird...
---
I used to do this all the time to hone my building skills. I mean, the stuff is free up to a point and with the contractor perk you can build quite a lot. I‚Äôve paused my practices since defending workshops has gotten tiresome and the new rules make doing anything else but building and defending during a play session nigh on impossible. I trust Bethesda will re-balance the PVP rules for workshop owners so at least we can give them up voluntarily without being attacked on the other side of the map while in the middle of a quest :)
---
Seems everyone else got a mothman statue, but I got a mothman altar
---
Yeah same happened to me. Just buy the cooking stove recipe, it's apparently just a skin for the existing item.
---
Suppose it makes a little sense, buying the lever action skin doesn't give you the rifle. But for camp items I think it should.
---
Well, Bethesda is renowned for releasing bugged games, but this is a life service game. It worked with the single player versions, because they were just that, single player.
---
I bought the game 2 weeks ago, and I treat it like that, a single player experience in the fallout universe.
---
If they didn't want the negative reception, they should have waited 6 months, and release the game in the stage that it's currently now. It would've solved so many things, and the game would've been met with posstive reviews and reception.
---
Still, maybe it's better that way, maybe it will deter them from making another multyplayer game, or at least, releasing another unfinished multyplayer game.
---
It's a shame, rushing things are never good. But the devs are on the good path, and I am content with my purchase, not thrilled, but content. 
---
Actually it's my day job. That's why I'm trying to save the time. Duh!
---
It's not. The atom shop one has a missile through the eye, that doesn't
---
I've got two pieces of gear that reduce weapon weight by 20% (yeah they do stack!) Which has been a blessing because my character carries around three guns and anti armor axe to save bullets. 
---
Ok yea maybe we can work something out. My pen name is same as on here. I‚Äôll hit u up later today
---
Oh I want them! Just turned off my Xbox out of sleepiness, but I really wanted the confetti on the floor plan and the big wall decoration that's like blue, red and white (can't remember the name). Old man winter would be cool but don't quote me on that.
---
Not sure what could I give in exchange though.
---
I can in about 12 hours.
---
I also bought mine from a player for 1.5k. 
---
It's not a fact, it's just an attempt from me to come up with an reasonable real-life explanation, why we can't have the screw from the scissors.
---
I'm the kind of guy who regards Star Wars as fantasy, not as science fiction.
---
Sorry for the misunderstanding
---
100 for the plans, 50 for the 2 masks? 
---
I just want a chainsaw buff. Then I can truly achieve my fantasy of Jason voorhees
---
Yeh I haven't seen it all week to be fair but in this group there were a lot of low level players, lvl10-20 but they were doing their part regardless of lvl, opinion on this seems to be divided though 
---
How much you charging for the word it‚Äôs 4 letters I need 
---
Did you save a blueprint? I save one after changes now as a backup. 
---
Lol insecure?
---
I said that was what was going to happen with Adventure mode and people on this forum naysaid.
---
Fuckin' told you so.
---
Well I guess my reply to this is obvious, but here it goes.
---
Hey Vic, don't quit your day job.
---
And well played...  ;-)
---
I had between 60-100 runs (lost count) got i think 9. Sold 7, gave one away, stashed the last.
---
Auf wiedersehen. Was a cool event.
---
Sorry, even though they're common, it's too low for me
---
Look closer buddy
---
2 beers. Because I like helping people build. 
---
This game really do need cross platform
---
Thanks man let me craft the two best beers 
---
All good, fully understand. 
---
I just got one but if you can how rare is the toothy man mask
---
You are the hero the wasteland needs... o7
---
I just ignore them, just like all the drinks. I don‚Äôt see any sense in it.
---
So far I checked the data (with xedit), and the Emergency protocol enchantment is missing the 50% damage reduction.
---
Only the 25% speed is listed there.
---
The bug is either in the description strings, or in the effect.
---
to be honnest, I find the 50% reduction a bit OP considering the insane lowHP build damages output, so this might have been nerfed a long time ago, but the description never been updated.
---
No, you have to get the plans from the civil war reenactor random encounter.
---
Nah. If you're a dickhead I want to know your username so you can't swap characters and keep being a dickhead.
---
Nuke Zone? absolutely, required for anything outside of it? nah. Unyielding and bloodied are two builds you can work towards, honestly really anything works outside of pvp
---
Yeah, really the meta right now is either semi-auto rifle builds or shotgun builds. (Aside from the insane melee builds.) Automatic just doesn't keep up.
---
And I agree, on my Handmades I prefer a reflex sight, semi-auto with armor piercing mag. That rifle is all about rapid single shots, and a regular scope slows you down too much.
---
Toothy man is common too
---
Just wrote esay, why picking items from ground is bad. 
---
Watoga, Phoenix, Harper's Ferry.  Been quite a while since the vendor patch...
---
Go outside.
---
Claim tokens have always been 0.1, and they're used at the ash heap mining sites during the event "lode bearing" you get more tokens the better your performance and get rewards based on token usage
---
Whats in the canister?
---
lol I blocked his channel before 76 ever even dropped. He was spamming dumb shit about Fallout 4 too.
---
Shit, is it gone? I did a few a couple of hours ago and was just hopping around now looking for more. Would have thought I had until maintenance :(:(:(:(:(
---
I feel your pain see it a lot and happen to me too these guys disgust me 
---
It's no problem. I'm usually a person who is serious but I have managed to be a kidder once in awhile.
---
Kinda Data from star trek tng.
---
Most other games don't work this way.  I'm sure you can find an example or two of it, but many do not.  So I would hazard a "No" right now.
---
To be honest, Watoga has actually gotten me some decent lego spawns from it. Feels like the last time I did it I got about 4 or so from it. And if you're nuking solo then at least everyone can get the machines there spawn in their own protectrons to farm compared to nuking WS and having leechers automatically show up to kill all the ghouls in the zone, leaving you with nothing but meat piles and misery.
---
Hell, I'd be happy with old possum but I wouldn't mind drinking some top shelf for a change.
---
Psn is same as here
---
Nice, my character is extremely similar to yours
---
&gt;  5% HP per hit
---
It's actually 5 DPS it's capped at.
---
That is 5 damage per second. 
---
Max of 5 damage per second regardless of how many hits.
---
I mya have made an air conditioner from rocks and vines but I am just gonna crap however and wherever the desire hits me, midstride.
---
Had the same drop lmao 
---
I have a Biv soundboard I've been messing with in game. Not really role-playing as Biv per say (that would be a bit tough) but enjoying being a roaving drunkard.
---
Lol you saying your first born son isn‚Äôt worth anything?!
---
Do you farm the mine event next to golf course (forgot names haven‚Äôt played in a while) if so all miners al level 40 so you get level 40 armor 
---
when playing quake champions via steam you're required to log into your bethesda.net account. Fallout 76 wouldn't be the first game that uses both accounts.
---
Omfg
---
Now screen almost freezes every time. After screen is back to move, SBQ is already dead and no loot.
---
Because this is a game where you can grind hundred regendaries daily and after a week of such grindfest get nothing valuable.
---
West of Groves Family cabin in the Northwest corner of the map in the forest. 
---
Because you did events before you was level 45? And killed mobs whose was under level 45? and was unlucky with RNG? 
---
good idea but how about some headphones, shit i dont play anything without them. 
---
That sounds really fun
---
No your wrong it happens figure it out yourself brother 
---
At least I'm apparently good at it. I guess 
---
Yeah, I know Quake Champions and TESLegends I originally played through [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net), and I could resume with the same progress on Steam.
---
lol I once claimed almost all workshops in a server and had an artillery network set up. No one was free from my hellfire
---
Now I really want to make an AA in my camp
---
No we don't, that weight just needs to be balanced since its way to high.
---
Weapon workbench then go to throwables 
---
Yes your are 100% correct 
---
It‚Äôs just their attempt at keeping the atomic shop purely cosmetic. Even something as simple as that could be seen as giving a pay to win advantage even tho it‚Äôs just a camp item. I‚Äôd rather they err on the side of caution in this scenario as I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to go down the slippery slope to loot boxes. 
---
It would change nothing in my life yet as with every improvement that would make the life more enjoyable and accessible for others I support this fully
---
They need to give me a fusion core M79 reciever.
---
Given it is top level and 3 star, I'd say 4K caps. I won't be online until this evening though. 
---
Fallout 76 already has enough cults.
---
Insult Bot does it for your own good; for what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You can even call him a hero of the wastelands.
---
CD keys, as in websites like G2A? If so, I'd rather not do that and go for more morally ok websites.
---
They normally target people at lower hp
---
It's nearly straight across from the entrance to the Lodge.
---
if you are standing in front of the Ski Lodge that has the vendor bot in it, and head toward Top of the World, there is a small area on your left just past the other building that resembles a small vendor stand/area.
---
Plans randomly spawn on one of the shelves, a friend was able to get the BOS Combat legs there yesterday as well, but since getting the BOS arms, I have only found other random armor mod plans.
---
Even game tips (while loading) says that!
---
Now you're being pedantic, the spirit of my post still stands and it's not the same as bumping it to 1000. It'd be like bumping it to 840 and giving your characters all access to all your stuff.
---
All I can craft are throwing knives under throwables. Is there a plan/recipe for it?
---
Plan 
---
Do you know when that‚Äôs coming? The change so the camp doesn‚Äôt take damage in passive mode?
---
All in all this will be fixed for us adventurers so kudos Bethesda 
---
Blueprints wint work for me. Something is always floating 
---
I have some headphones too but sometimes - like when farming casually - I prefer to be able to interact with the outside world while still playing. I know its my fault for being distracted, but its actually besides the point as I dont use these perks. My point and the principle I support here is that while for me hearing the game or not is a choice, it might not be for everyone, and I stand by those whose choices are limited.
---
My wife and I had someone stop by the camp and we were friendly with him. He said we should add each other and join up. I said sure but we don't use mics and we mostly do our own thing. We go to make supper and come back and my wife's base is being destroyed and this dude and some other person are there. So I log my wife and I off. This morning my wife logs on and notices a message from this person we befriended that says "I'll find you and your husband. I paid a big bounty on your husband's head" lol what? People are funny. I hope survival mode/adventure mode stops this shit from happening. It's mostly just annoying. Feels like I'm seeing less and less of people just stopping by and sharing plans and junk with each other and then going on their way.
---
Most scissors use rivets. 
---
Yeah the workshops give you resources, all kinds of junk. 
---
Got it, thanks! I was worried that was it. Also if someone on my team is fighting will I be flagged? 
---
Theres a few encounter spots I frequent that aren‚Äôt on this map, so there‚Äôs probably a lot left to explore. Don‚Äôt give up yet!
---
Oh yea, there were a couple time I didn't get a hit in, either, I knew it, and I accept that.  
---
In those cases, the loot window appeared and everything acted as it should - the loot window wsa empty, meat pile, etc.
---
I'm talking when I was at the lead of the pack, and I know I scored multiple hits - the sloth corpse bugs, and does not even display the loot window.  
---
Then after 5 min or so, the corpse disappears w/ no meat pile. 
---
That happened 3 out of the last 4 times I did the event.
---
I havent found anything either but if history tells us anything it will be postponed and 9am est
---
I'm trying to get the costumes and the civil war outfits. I've found 2 spawn locations for each that I've been running a circuit on, but there is just a 4% chance to spawn the event you want each time.
---
The first location for the trick or treater, is just south of crevasse dam, NE section of map. Fast travel to the dam, and then stay in place, and turn to face the road going uphill. It should be just up the hill in the right lane, past the car. On the map, it will be just NW of the hwy 65 sign.
---
The second isn't near a map location. It's almost directly N of the munitions factory. I usually fast travel to the Bailey Family Cabin, and run straight NW from there. The spawn location is inside a curve of the cliff wall, there's a small flat topped hill right at the base of the cliff where there's a spawn point. Looking at the map, above munitions, there's a small topographical line that forms a point towards E. If you draw a line east from it, and a line north from munitions, where they cross is where the spawn point is.
---
I just got the purple and white ski suit plan from the second location last night too.
---
I'm bringing my main over, and running specifically an assassins explosive .50 and junkies gamma gun for pvp. One pumping out impressive suppressing fire, the other a hard counter to bloodied unyielding, the key to my build is a chameleon dense robot chest. 
---
If I have to buy it again I'm gonna be mad. We should be able to transfer it over.
---
10am the are taking the game offline for the update, usually playable 1-3 hours after that.
---
I just took a screw out of all my scissors and put them back in.
---
I always see it at watoga train station
---
Yeah. I was already running low on supplies when I went in. But then I lost pretty much everything. 
---
Do you remember where you got it?
---
Ah I don‚Äôt know then, that only seemed to happen to me with scorchbeasts during the Surface to air events, unless they just don‚Äôt give the loot if the anti air machine kills it.
---
Harper ferry bot

---
I think a vendor at white springs but not sure
---
Totally doesn‚Äôt stand out
---
Im here at harpers ferry right now and he has it
---
Please set your game to english if you post screenshots of it.
---
Ooooh man. I just server hopped for a solid 20 minutes without getting it, figured I better check here... No balloons, no bee hives in tbe Honey Haus... All the event stuff is gone :-( Still needed the donut recipe...
---
I have a feeling it's partially because I tried playing like normal fallout. So i hardly do events or farm anything.
---
I've got a purple and white skiing outfit, but i'm not sure how common that is?
---
Ever since those challenges started, I have only been 2 hours sober and haven't recovered since.
---
After one of the previous patches, the duplicate apparel stopped stacking.. it goes for everything. Maybe one day they will fix it again
---
Thanks that was helpful! :)
---
Good luck man. It took forever but the medic trophy was my 2nd to last and the LITerally trophy was my absolute last. 
---
RNJesus knew I needed mags and withheld the last 4 from the world spawn for almost a month. 
---
Kovac-muldoon is actually the support satellite for the enclave related quests. 
---
Though a few more enclave related bunkers would be nice I think Whitesprings is as far as they will go with it.
---
Passive mode is more of a I'm shooting near you and dont want you to murder me because splash damage. It's never really stopped people hurting you with these over the top PvP builds 
---
I was thinking about something like this too, I usually like to build up workshops to look nice and ‚Äúlived in‚Äù, so it would be awesome to get to show some of it off. 
---
Maybe if you have a certain amount of materials you could have the workshop rebuild what was there before 
---
Some lvl +100 built a *massive* compound at the ammo factory, decked out with a bar, musical instruments, workshop room, etc. Admired the view while I was *partaking* of some communal 5.56 ammo left in some weird machine
---
Just block the offending user, the database takes care of the rest in the backend.
---
It does surprise me that your account name is used kinda less secure... normally you would have a profile name that is used to add an extra layer of security.... 
---
Kek, some people just want to spread misinformation 
---
I didn't get into chems until after i met rose, but otherwise identical, styled myself as the last of the trappers, built murder hotels, and geared up for my former vault mates to come to the same conclusion. 
---
Why not both? Elder Scrolls Online shows both. 
---
There is no option. I'd have to set the whole console to english. I can translate, if there is something you can't read.
---
It used to be your armor could still be damaged after you die and before you respawn, idk if it‚Äôs still true but that‚Äôs why I always spawn ASAP so as not to incur any unneeded damage.
---
But yeah they‚Äôre probably blocking you for the session and maybe even typing out a salty report to Bethesda where they lie and call you a duper lol
---
doing the overseers work there good buddy
---
Cause you spend most of your time in low level areas. Instead of higher level areas. White springs doesn't count
---
As a person who thinks the game should be released as an early access and who enjoyed it since beta, despite all its flaws and the period where it was literally unplayable (I'm looking at you weight glitch fix that removed the weight bonuses from your legit stuff for everybody who logged out with pocketed or excavator armor).
---
Right now the game breaking bugs are gone, the game is getting new harsher game mode today, the experience was rather stable in recent period.  
---
Historically, its not unreasonable to assume this week will be full of explosions and problems, because the game is really extremely complicated and ambitious construction. Next week should solve the major problems that could arise now.
---
Overall if I were to rate how I see the game, 5 on release, 4 at worst period, 7 now, probably 8 when they release this new game mode today, and with a honest potential of becoming a 10 and THE GAME if it adds some sense of persistency of player actions and community interactions, some sort of faction system that would make it so that you are usually placed on sets of servers shared between some factions so that there are often conflicts and cooperations to take advantage in those conflicts. This is IMO where F76 misses what it could be the most, the rest aspects of gameplay are pretty cool.
---
There's still a few "off-limits" areas around Whitesprings, and in the Enclave bunker itself.
---
They could also in a future DLC have some of those collapsed wings in the bunker repaired as well. So even if they aren't "new bunkers" there's still room for expansion.
---
I agree. That 60s sound feels too modern.
---
I'd rather also be able to name and shame with video evidence.
---
Oh shit, you‚Äôre the one who mentioned that raider sub a little while ago, haha right on. 
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre familiar with fo4, but I feel like our characters would get along with Red Eye from Nuka World lol
---
If you played it like normal fallout then you would of spent a large portion of time trekking through the mire. I think your exaggerating and salty.
---
Okay. That gag took me way too long to figure out. Nice one.
---
I don‚Äôt think handing people a few cups of water, some food, and maybe some stimpaks is taking away the ‚Äúwhole game‚Äù lmao
---
Server hopping is a pain as I play with 2 friends. 
---
I don‚Äôt think giving someone some water, food, and maybe some stimpaks is ‚Äúbypassing the whole actual part of the game‚Äù 
---
I don't mind the upbeat nature of the song, it's just that it seems a little out of place, both in time and space.
---
Some of the other game music is quite depressing. Especially the classical dirges that come out of the Jukeboxes. I feel we need some old time Rock n' Roll for them.
---
I am a member of one Discord called Queen Nukes Only, but its pretty dead now.
---
Slap damage is literally capped at 5 damage a shot every 6 seconds. You must have owned a workshop. Stop lying and spreading false information 
---
Well, it would ruin the ‚Äòimmersion‚Äô factor.  In real life, deaf people cant here loose change lying around.  But, come to think of it, neither can we...
---
I can hear Bobbleheads tho, so-ya there‚Äôs that.
---
I'm assuming we'll be able to get into the tennis club at some point, as well as the top 2 floors of the hotel. They didn't put them there for nothing, they'll surely be opened in a DLC.
---
YES! Some of the hair on this game and Fallout 4 is just terrible.
---
Well, this is exactly why I do what I do. Sorry for the griefers man :/ they piss me off too
---
Thank you sir
---
Thank you for the info, this is good feedback. \^\^ I'll definitely take the pros and cons listed here into my decision to get the game or not.
---
Awwh. The li'l snowflake afraid of other languages.
---
Yeah, because those 9000 people represent the entire population that plays this game.
---
r/market76 is extremely active 
---
r/fo76bazaar is less active, but still moves enough to check it
---
The official reddit Fallout Discord located on the sidebar has nuke groups as well as trading so it's pretty useful. 
---
more than 400 runs?
---
Took a look a little bit ago, the planned updates seem pretty intriguing to me. \^\^
---
Stay on the right side of the map and run the events. Farming whitesprings gets boring, uranium fever only drops lvl 40 gear. Look for horde events, they're quick, easy, and generally have a 3 * as the horde leader. That said, I received %$&amp;#ing 1* wood pieces from three, 3* legendaries last night.
---
You can also make a circuit around Watoga if you're in the area, just make sure it's spawning lvl 50 bots.
---
I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve tested or researched to any length. Anecdotal based on experience under definitely not controlled conditions. 
---
Generally it only did anything noticeable (worth turning pacifist mode on for) to pre-50 folks. I‚Äôve been wrong before, but I never noticed an issue with non-heavy low ROF or melee weapons. Considering I don‚Äôt actively try to kill people most of the time, these are just instances I‚Äôve gained a bounty when pulling the trigger without checking down range. 
---
I got the beret on my first run through the event.  I wear it with pride.  It goes well with my enclave generals uniform.
---
No I'm not I actually got language certificates for German , Italian , Swedish and Hungarian , but it's just annoying to see a foreign language on an english subreddit.
---
Unllllllesssss you have a workshop and they take it then they can kill yah 
---
Wrong, you only get the helmet paint by scrapping.
---
I agree, and although several weapons have no weight reducing perk cards available, there is armor that reduces the weight of all weapons, I run with 3 pieces of weapons WR armor, and getting into my PA adds around 60 lbs typically.
---
I would like to see the armor perks still functional while in a hazmat suit, but I do see the balance issue with it working in power Armor as well.
---
They're expensive from the vendor bots
---
Not the booty hole!
---
Your point is?
---
Got it for arms or torso last week... Try harder :D
---
I just want walls and walls of the different teddy bears. 
---
You unlock the plans using the terminal on the outside of Ft Defiance once you have completed their story arc. It is a fully modded out hunting rifle that has the same mats cost as just a regular vanilla hunting rifle.
---
TLDR: You get a LOT of rifle for a little mats. 
---
In fo4 you could do that, so definitely agree with this !!!
---
This is coming.  Pretty sure it's on the roadmap.
---
The Brewing Fermenter is actually using the system they are developing to select items to display from your Stash on certain CAMP items.
---
This is very true! I do see them expanding (opening up) whitesprings more down the road.
---
That‚Äôs usually the best answer. You could also run aid weight stuff and not take the perks to reduce them, then run strong back to offset the weight of the rifles. There‚Äôs a solution, you just have to look at the big picture. 
---
Ohhhh man raven rock on the 6th line... Elderscrolls 6 skyrim confirmed
---
&gt;I'd rather shove wet spaghetti up a Bobcats ass on a Tuesday morning than hump and bump a 22 pound weapon.
---
Alright this had me dying. Have an upvote good sir.
---
If only it was rewarding me atoms for drinking IRL. I'd be able to buy anything I want!
---
Well they will be a brewing so I‚Äôm glad you want to do it later because they will need to ferment
---
Poseidon Oil Rig is a reference to Fallout 2. It's off the West coast of the former USA.
---
Yes. Thank you. They could have made it a little more intuitive. 
---
Mating party
---
Hell yeah..  
---
I just farmed 220 there in one go :P  
---
Your best bet would be to specialize into one weapon type with a sub weapon type to conserve ammo.
---
I find rifle/auto rifle with pistols being a sub a versatile build. Another would be melee with heavy weapons as a sub. Also assassins in my opinion isn‚Äôt very strong your best bet would be aa/e or bloodied/e. Tse is still pretty good.
---
Balance? What, because if the hand made was under 20 lbs it would be too OP? Please. If we are talking about balance, the minigun should weigh more.  
---
It is just a decision that was not thoroughly thought through. I would expect them to adjust the weight at some point.
---
Damn, I want a Futurama mask next year now.
---
My tesla gun arcs between people when we are all packed up fighting.
---
 But yup Indeed i get the message showing you can not damage people in an event. Not that i was trying to, it's just how the tesla gun works so dont forget to turn pacifist mode on top of the event immunity just in case. Because *bugs may happen* .
---
The Poseidon Oil Rig is from Fallout 2 so it probably won't get used as a new area
---
XD
---
I'm not lying, I got completely dropped in less than 3 seconds by a guy who was a level 290 (I was about 100). I think he was using a melee weapon of some sort (he killed me after i denied a trade, so whatever it was he was really close to me) but it happened so fast my game froze a bit and I couldn't really tell. I have passive mode turned on 24/7. Is there any way this could be a glitch? 
---
I think grahm has them to
---
If he "bypassed" slap damage that means he initiated PvP legitimately in some way (possibly via workshop contesting, PvP initiated by team member, PvP accidentally initiated by you, hard to say without more details).
---
Which means even after this update you would have died. Because it is NOT possible to bypass slap damage/overcome slap damage limitations by having ludicrous amounts of damage (it's limited to 5hp/sec).
---
Video from when explosive bobblehead stacking was a thing and they STILL couldn't oneshot through slap damage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ
---
I've had pacifist on pretty much since I started playing the game, and have been attacked by numerous people, and never had any damage that wasn't trivial to out-heal. 
---
I don't have any of the "damage melee attacker" perks, gear, or mutations, so there's never anything that could potentially flag me as accepting their pvp invite.
---
And I don't usually claim workshops (I believe owning one makes you auto-accept PVP engagements as long as they or someone in their group challenge your ownership of the workshop).
---
Workshop PVP should also be limited to the build area of the workshop.  If the person taking it leaves, the PVP and the taking is cancelled and they need to start the process again.
---
Instead, they start taking it just to have a 100% open killing target.  Most of the time, they don't even take it.  They just want to start the process, then travel to you and take you out.
---
I never see people owning workshops anymore.  The griefers have ruined that part of the game as well.
---
And I agree, the owner should 100% ***ALWAYS*** have the option to abandon the workshop if another player starts to take it.
---
Saw that as I absolutely destroy you with my BE LMG
---
Same here!
---
I know a few people with hearing conditions and I fully support this idea if not in the UI but could be in the vibration in the controller?
---
I can sell you a set if not. Got all common masks, beret, and all plans.
---
If your still farming White springs. Then you both are wasting your time.
---
I don't know if it was one-hit, but it was so fast It may as well have been. It took the guy like 2 seconds to drop me. 
---
Trading with folks is probably your best bet at this point. :/ 
---
It's a once a year thing so if this game is still going strong you can try again next year. 
---
so it takes you what now 10 minutes after nerf?
---
So do I.
---
I want to recreate my bedroom in the vault as an eventual goal.
---
And you can get shot in the face by other players fighting for control lol
---
Thanks for not understanding the whole situation. 
---
With or without a microphone, you have to meet the person, and ask them to team because you want to launch a nuke. That's an unnecessary effort to play the game.
---
There is actually a discord server for this Reddit thread and that's how I met a lot of my fo76 friends. I keep discord open on my 2nd monitor and can alt + tab to it to talk to them. I join the server they're in even if we aren't actively in a party together because we gather at one person's camp and drop extra gear, plans, and ammo. There are a lot of fo76 discord groups you can join.
---
Going strong... Look at ESO that game flopped hard to begin with. Only way now is up for 76.
---
Just bought for around 1500 caps from Watoga Plaza vendor. 
---
nuke whitespring gulf course and run around it in circles. I lvled 5 times from 75 to 80 and came out with 30 legen. and ah bunch of flux material. 
---
most off legen were useless but got me a few that I as looking for. 
---
Preach his name!

Not sure if this has been stated previously but I only carry one fusion core. If I have one in my stash, when the core depletes, it automatically fills from the one in stash. I am trying to prove this but ran out of cores üòÇ
---
Tomahawks can be crafted only if you find the plan. And the plan is stupidly rare. It doesn't appear at vendors.
---
It was a fun event. It brought people together with no griefers. Every time I server hopped people came from across the map to help. I have 127 masks between 2 Xbox‚Äôs. Rare masks made me want them even more. I played this as much as possible all week so it doesn‚Äôt seem fair for a timed event. If we had all year long I would say keep them rare and make it a grind like Mr Fuzzy. 
---
This was supposed to be about the community but complete silence from Devs and CMs this week makes me suspicious. Trying to encourage the community without communication doesn‚Äôt make us feel good. They were bragging about the event coming but then disappeared when we had questions. I would love to see stats about how many times the parade was played and how many rare drops.
---
Yes, you will. Some people are using this to kill high level (ppl over lvl 300), basicaly you server hop until you find some high level who own workshop. Then you let your friends join server, make group, they go up to him, as they are near him, you claim his workshop, this flag him PvP active for your friends and as they kill them you split his 300bottlecaps.
---
When you "drop" an item, that comes from the atomshop, it is being scrapped. Dropping is not possible
---
I hope so I think it would be awesome to see how people decorate their homes not just using what plans they can find to do it with 
---
Hey OP, sorry that Anthem and Red Dead are stale AF. This game isn't for you either.
---
How many beret is there?
---
It would actually not even get that far, as an Atom shop item it is destroyed not dropped.
---
This is a really good point, from a gameplay standpoint I understand they want you to work a little, but this is unfair for deaf people.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing that it's possible to die from slap damage. I think it's moreso /u/steelerswins is tired of seeing people post and comment erroneously saying they were oneshot through slap damage, and I completely agree it's obnoxious to see people so readily spread misinformation because they're upset someone killed them in a video game where death has next to no consequence.

Great Pic!
---
On what system? Currently on Xbox, balloon are still there. But server hopping don't seems to work?
---
What! That sucks, was about to hop on for one final fasnacht parade!
---
There's both, i know you want this to be more like something familiar but nothing can bring back the WoW of your youth.
---
Is there a special route in Watoga? Cause I just don‚Äôt have luck there and legendaries are the exeption for me..
---
I was thinking the Perk Card image slowing fading in and out then faster the closer you are to the caps  stash. 
---
Read it again. Also now i don't do queens, and i am over all avoiding nukes. Done too much of them.
---
Yes, if a team member is flagged for PvP with someone then everyone on the team is flagged.
---
Like anthem or No mans sky? Nothing beat red dead online launch day! Oh wait...
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a 50% damage debufg when you‚Äôre not able to pay the caps when killed? Could be wrong though..
---
Your last sentence completely confirms veteran status. Carry on.
---
That happened to me for the first time last night, I didn't know this is what caused it to happen so thanks for the heads up.  The whole heart just vanished and the quest marker was suddenly across the map near the whitesprings
---

True, I carry a lot of weapons, Aid, &amp; Ammo, but can still drop my weight to around 180/340 when I clean out all the excess stuff I'm carrying.
---
Xbox?
---
They really shouldn't be that rare, they aren't that great and can be hard to use. I just want to make a pure melee who's only ranged is throwing.
---
Thank you
---
Then you're just a dick. XD
---
I haven‚Äôt played since launch what the hell?
---
Next month should have everyday daily challenge with being sober. (But not shit, like get 3lvl ups sober in one day shit)
---
Haha, same man.
---
I think survival mode mechanics will surprise us all.
---
RnG Jesus is not with u. U need to pray to him.
---
Every weapon class has something missing that most other have. If you identify all the weapon specific perk cards and compare them side by side, it becomes obvious.
---
You get access to resources, a free fast travel point, and will periodically get "Defend" quests for the workshop against waves of creatures/Scorched (it's random and depends on where the workshop is on the map as far as which types of enemies will attack).
---
The "Defend" quests are also pretty good for getting C.A.M.P. plans, various aid items like stimpaks, and XP (via both completion of the quest and by killing the enemies that show up).
---
Yeah , you could look at it that way ,but it is only normal for users to demand posts to be made in english on an english subreddit, right?
---
On the also unlikely spectrum; I'd give everything for the Hellfire Power Armor as either actual armor or a skin for the X01 or something.
---
But I believe it nonetheless.

It's already confirmed and on the roadmap.

I got caps to blow 
---
Your dad pulling out would have made the world better. 
---
Now you are last guy on earth who played fallout and is not alcoholic.
---
Good point, but it can be used since Fallout 2 plays in 2241 we're much earlier here in 76.
---
That'd be nice. I would love to see that, instead of something like longdongbong69. (User name taken from a friend on xbox when he messaged someone after a game of cod)
---
 I always have pacifist on, for this reason.  
---
During the Parade event I used a machine gun - easier to get hits on the sloth that way.  If I had a stray shot that hit someone, a message pops up on screen telling me I had pacifist on, therefore could not damage another player.
---
   In the nuke zone, I am armed with a vampire machete - it works better for me, and I don't stray shot a robot. 
---
Pacifist is on so I don't accidentally damage another player in close quarter bloated fighting.
---
Out the gate near WS station, hang a right - there's a flatbed truck a bit down the road - these always 5 bloated there.
---
  I was on the flatbed, the bloated were clustered at my feet - I was swinging down, not out, and no other players were around.  Even if I was using a frearm, theres a hill on both sides - shots would have been in the dirt, not arced over the hill into the WS grounds.
---
Anyway, I had killed 3 of the bloated, jumped off the truck, looted the legendary, then jumped back on the truck - (in the right spot on the flatbed, the bloated can't hit you).  
---
  I was standing in that spot, looked around, and saw the 297 come over the top of the hill.  Waited to see what he was going to do/watch the fight when the other two bloated saw him..   
---
He did not pause to fight with the 2 remaining bloated.   He jumped up on the back of the truck with me, and started swinging - at me.
---
Because I had pacifist on, his hits were not doing much damage - I'm pretty sure that how I lived long enough to get on the mic to sate I wasn't interested in PVP - he took several more swings after that.  Then I server hopped.
---
lol it's not for balance. You think the 0.1 pound bobby pins were intentional? If so, why did they adjust it? The weight should simply reflect real world as it's what people know. The .50 cal bullet being weaker than a 5.56 is just ridiculous. 
---
Crap. I didn‚Äôt know it was rare and I dropped it in a suitcase somewhere üò≤ I don‚Äôt use melee weapons and didnt think it mattered 
---
It's a digital item in a digital world, that you would leave in your stash box after showing off to everyone you could when playing for a few weeks. 
---
It doesn't seem fair how many posts there are complaining about something like this. The event had way more valuable loot then these masks.   
---
I'm guessing that most of the people really upset are people that figured they could sell them for caps or real life money. 
---
I did too. They all got scrapped when I got tired of scrolling. I feel the 70 fashnact masks I have, will meet the same fate in the next few days.
---
Main Menu of the game said 10am EDT.
---
I'm holding off on survival for several months.  I can't imagine that there won't be some really serious balance changes coming post- beta.   
---
Power armor is nearly useless, which makes at least one  entire class of weapons useless: heavy weapons are power armor dependent because of the stabilized perk.
---
Having entire builds and weapon classes be useless isn't sustainable. 
---
true.
---
I'd love camp robots, even if they were only useful as decorations instead of as defense or anything 
---
I‚Äôm not going to argue with you about this. We trade and it‚Äôs not a huge deal. I don‚Äôt expect this to get ‚Äúfixed‚Äù any time soon
---
Usually this is the case because all players in an event area should be flagged as temporary team mates. That said, I have seen people in events (SBQ, Fassnatcht parade) who were the normal neutral color yellow rather than the darker event team mate yellow color.
---
Bethesda did make a basement in Skyrim in the Homefire DLC, so it's not unheard of. I made myself a fantastic home with a basement forge, displaying all my many many armours.

---
I got Infiltrators at the Golf Club yesterday instead of Ghouls, and several were legendary.
---
If we're getting into weights... my L1A1 weighed about 10lbs with no magazine.  However ammo is heavy - I recall a rough guide being '400 rounds  is 20 lbs'. Sort of thing a squaddie remembers. So while the handmade is over twice the weight it should be, there's no way I should be wandering about with 1000+ rounds of 5.56, 600 shotgun cartridges, 500 .44 etc. Not to mention 50 grenades. So if we get authentic weapon weights (the minigun weight is just silly) then I would expect Beth to give us authentic ammo weights.  I'd rather have lots of ammo thanks, given how much some stuff soaks up.
---
Speak for yourself mate, Some of us enjoy kidney failures and ruined lives
---
Does that work at the Queen? 
---
I dont think so. 
---
Just convert ammo to other ammo using a caps-based conversion to balance. So if shotgun shells are intentionally the most expensive ammo in the game and let's say 5mm are the cheapest then your trade ratio is whatever that difference is, maybe five 5mm gets you 1 shotgun shell.
---
Use the ammo vending machines at train stations since I'm pretty sure nobody uses them now for any reason. 
---
Put a cap on the total volume of ammo held by the machines like you already have on the vendors, so people can only claim a maximum number of say 100 rounds of any one ammo per day. 
---
Why not, we git weightcards for all other stuff in the game, except guns. Armor, PA, explosives, food, chems, ammo, you name it. Everything except for guns.
---
So there is four different types of beret?
---
We can Danse if we want to!
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and I have an abundance of every masks and plans,  I‚Äôll trade them to any plan I do not know or you can just straight up buy them. 
---
It could be, I just doubt they'd do it. We've not had any locations being reused from older games yet and the Bethesda games are set on the East Coast, whereas the older ones and New Vegas are set on the West. I'd love them to go back and visit some of the old locations though. 
---
my bad, i missed that lol 
---
yeah I dont mess much with the SBQ i have killed her a few times but for me the rewards do not balance the rss you use to kill her. 
---
nukes I still do they are fun
---
Noooooo I was gonna do it one more time!
---
Yes, I am glad somebody else does this too.
---
I would have also expected Nuuuuuuuke-colaaaa
---
Orbital strike it's the only way to be sure.
---
I run a western and single action furious Vats build. Yes if you have good pistols it's viable. TSE is not recommended in PvP. Why? If you PvP then you know why.  Also stealth boy is easy to deal with. See ya out there.
---
That would be such a great way to implement the camp vending machine thing. Let you place your own robot vendor and stock them up with stuff to sell. That way people with bars and shopfronts at their camp could station a bartender or cashier bot there
---
Nooo just the one
---
Lol, false friend.
---

All in all, if you are disconnected because the server crashed, you will not be able to rejoin it anyway... :/
---
Yes. And I had already learned the plan and built the original version in my camp. I was a little annoyed, but I went and bought a plan in ws. There was definitely something strange going on there. 
---
I blueprinted a small patio section of my house (2 x 3 tiles) that includes all crafting benches and such. Very easy to place since its only 2 by 3 and not that expensive on junk materials.
---
Soon as I take over a workshop first thing I do is collect and scrap any junk lying around, slap er down and turret the place up for the attack event that is soon incoming.
---
Apparently he found your offering unworthy. 
---
Stupid question‚Ä¶ but did the mask, when you picked it up, have the atom shop logo next to it?
---
The best way to deal with a griefer like this is judicious use of pulse grenades! That'll teach the jerk. :P
---
He got nerfed or everyone is buying all the good stuff.
---
you assume that I haven't finished them
---
I'd pay caps for the effigy, it's the only thing I wanted that never dropped for me.  I don't have any spare plans to trade for it unfortunately... let me know if you're interested
---
I actually had this FINALLY trigger last night...to say I was shocked is an understatement!
---
&gt;Not because of Survival (that's awesome too) but for the changes to PVP in Adventure mode. Literally 10 minutes ago, some guy basically killed me in one second, bypassing all "slap damage" and took 100 of my caps just because I didn't want to trade my Furious Handmade Rifle. Now that "slap damage" is being removed, and people won't deal ANY damage to you unless you fire back, I won't have to deal with that sort of B.S any longer. Praise Atom!
---
**Edit:** Okay, after reading comments from people who have had similar issues, I think I figured out what happened. I'm pretty sure this guy's friend contested one of my workshops. I just now learned about how you can be flagged for pvp even if you're not in your workshop and someone contests it. I think that's a dumb mechanic but this one's on me. I'm not trying to "lie and mislead people" i was just genuinely confused about a game mechanic I didn't know existed. Not everybody knows every in and out of this game.
---
Dude! I have absolutely no screws on both PC and Xbox and it drives me absolutely nuts to not  be able to make my weapon attachments. 
---
I would HAPPILY take as many screws out of your hands as you please, whichever platform you are on! 
---
I‚Äôm interested in the trading post, what is that?
---
2 strength? Dang... never done a build that low. I don't max it but dang. 
---
Kinda curious about doing something like this on my next character. 
---
It's a good plan, we can drink to forget about his singing lol 
---
Playing a low STR sniper build, I FEEL THIS. I have 2 guns on me weighing almost 35 lbs of my 160 carry weight. Feels bad man.
---
Is it over or is over until shutdown.
---
Maybe the screw in the scissors is so short it doesn't have enough threading to be usable, and so counts as steel.. or maybe it's a rivet.

Real talk tho, what the hell do pistols have?
---
Cool strawman. But that's not what I said, my point is that thus far we only have 1 confirmed sighting on anything other than an uncommon mask. And data has confirmed that the drop rates are bugged. For a game with as many problem as 76, Bethesda denying the problem exists and not doing anything to fix it is a bad look
---
Yeah I jumped in my PA the second time (as above) and it made no difference at all. 
---
that makes 2 of us. 
---
My bad, I literally just learned about this mechanic. I'm not trying to lie and spread information. I'm deleting this post in 30 minutes.
---
If there is no one who offers some plans or mask, I'll come back to you! 
---
My group takes workshops sometimes just to build in. It‚Äôs great fun! Just like settlements in FO4. It‚Äôs basically the closest to a ‚ÄúTOWN‚Äù concept we‚Äôre going to get on here - the ability for us to build together.
---
We really like to build at Tyler County. We did an entire Shanty Town there once: inn, bar, store, infirmary, farm. 
---
I use big guns and carry around about a dozen weapons with my 90% weight reduction. The mini gun your showing should weigh 18 pounds otherwise you have a perk equipped. 
---
I've bought from cd keys and they don't mess you over, just because it isn't a more well known retailer 
---
You gotta hand it to em. Bethesda knows how to troll
---
Pvp is 50 percent gear, 40 percent build, and 10 percent connection.
---
If you don't have good gear, you die.
---
If you don't have a good build, you die.
---
And of course, ping cheese helps.
---
welcome to fallout 76. rip.
---
Well, we got us a real pioneer here! Incredible work, and good call on the unsaturated colors. That really makes the markers pop out. I might have to remake the entire thing that way, so I can shrink down my markers. Thanks for sharing, I'll be checking all of these out!
---
Yah but id rather have a ammo bench if theyde let us break it down for aesthetic  reasons
---
Even the 2.5s are conscious and sentient.  Finish Nick's story and how he deals with being formed from a dead guy's memories and tell me that isn't real pathos. 
---
I saw it after i posted this.i was behind on the times
---
i would if I was you, an good all around build for PVP would be a mistake.
---
Also, as a very AK looking gun, the Handmade should fire the heavier 7.62mm round not 5.56mm
---
I did not know that this town really exists...
---
As soon as I saw ‚Äúthe honey haus‚Äú, I was like: pikachu.jpg .
---
They deserved the critique, but they also deserve some praise.
---
So: good job, Bethesda!
---
Trying to be honest. I love the game, but I won't deny my commonly explaination to people asked why is this thing refusing to cooperate is "typical Fallout".
---
If you liked the exploration factor of previous games, and the thrill of piecing the puzzle together, this is the best 3D Fallout so far IMO.
---
You will currently lack the experience of influencing the world and shaping it to your liking, that were crucial aspects of previous entries to the franchise.
---
That's pretty much the reception of Fo76 to a T on Reddit. Bunch of FO4 fanboys crying because it isn't another Fallout.

 Wow. How did you make that 3 stories!?

I'm gonna say no to this. It would make VATS builds mandatory and the game would be whoever clicks vats first.

It‚Äôs a small 2x1 locked steel structure with windows and a 2x1 platform in front of it, a billboard above, stash boxes on both sides and lots of flashing lights. I pop it down when I‚Äôm in the mood to sell goods.

thats what i thought so the survival mode could be very expensive cap wise
---
i have seen it after the patch in watoga/harpers, i thinkg 1,4k caps or something around there.
---
Shoulda picked one up 
---
I started a new character after patch 7 and it looks like new characters get the Camden Park dailies as expected. My old character still doesn‚Äôt get those dailies anymore. Hope it‚Äôs fixed with the next patch ...
---
Yeah, well this and my last few experiences with bounty hunting have put me right off Survival mode. Sorry Beth, give me more ‚Äòwork together‚Äô events like Fasnacht..

Oh you're right my bad. In my defense this was the first thing I saw when I woke up

Anyone looking to sell Tech Data on PS4 let me know.

You're not going to be prioritizing a beautiful house in survival mode, I'm afraid. At least not until it's decked out as best as it can to kill anyone that would attempt to attack you when you're inside it. A camp that looks pretty won't save your skin.

I don‚Äôt have a problem, I just need a little something to get my nerve up before a fight. 
---
Have a look on the thread again, PS4 dude looking to buy. 
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs like 12 plans. The effigy goes for 1k on its own most of the time. I‚Äôd do 4K for all. And throw in a beret.
---
I'm fairly certain they're a reference to late 90s chatbots and the way they would phrase vague questions to keep "conversations" going. 
---
And good gear is RNG dependent. I can't imagine PVP remaining in its current state.

Grahm always has it for me and very rarely i see it in whitesprings

Ya a note, but it never shows up in my inventory.  So don‚Äôt know.

I've actually stopped doing my dailies because I'm tired of all the "do this or that while intoxicated" challenges.  I'll get atoms for leveling up, but that's about it.

Ok thanks

Dead underneath dryer chemical

I played rust, i had fancy houses there. People think it will be huge battlefield. I know you will not meet much people, if you will not want to. Also this comunity is not much pvp based, so i am not scared.
---
As a native West Virginian, you have no idea how proud I am to hear someone say that!
---
You still have some to sell?
---
I will only being on over to survival mode to get the weekly unique weapons.
---
I wish they would have just had everybody start over a new character because I would have played survival mode then.
---
As it stands right now with transfer and back-and-forth between modes I'm not intrested at all.
---
Log out and back in? The vendors stuff changes. 
---
It honestly looks fantastic!
---
Harpers Ferry is the only place I've seen it sold, and was where I bought it. Might need to server hop to get the vendor to stock it. As youre level 15 it should show up as that's the min level for it. Alternative is to travel to Berkeley Springs. At the top of the town from the spawn point there's a building where on the roof a handmade is avaliable to pick up. Follow a you tube video to get the exact location. If it's not there, someone's already had it so just server hop and try again
---
Not sure if mentioned, I didn‚Äôt read all comments but I found the lemonade stand roughly around the area of fissure prime and the delta station that‚Äôs south. Away from console to pin point it but it was a very ‚Äòrandom‚Äô surprise to find... my under levelled friend did not appreciate me buying lemonade plans whil he was attacked by scorch beasts.
---
I do only easy ones. For example get level at level 200 is imposible now. But before i was doing all of them and i had more than 10k atoms just from playing.
---
There is a bullshit exscuse you can find in a note in the northern area on a church that the ghouls have left for the underworld from fallout 3. Just sounds more like a cop out to me
---
I agree. Having to do things drunk is my bag man. I won't do them. I don't use chems, with the exception of psycho in a tough fight.
---
you funny guy. Is there a corresponding german sub and would that make any sense at all?
---
Incidentally, I could not find a rule stating that only english content is allowed. You are welcome to show me this rule
---
They are also for sale at watoga train station
---
It‚Äôs not going to be fun at all. What‚Äôs the point of survival mode when everyone is going to be running around already unkillable with TSE weapons? 
---
I‚Äôve never heard of Mega Sloth. How can I join
---
I just added the discord link!
---
Yeah, I was walking around my church and saw a box of Bobby pins and I immediately picked them up. Thinking to myself: Yes! I'm going to pick so many locks! Then I realized.....I'm in the real world.
---
OK, if thats what they are doing, then im out. It must be lvl 1 for all, and let experience and RNG rule.
---
No way im playing when you can buy anything on the  market...too bad.
---
Maybe watoga but it will be pricy
---
No just one. I have 4.
---
Apparently, they did. No word on whether or not it‚Äôs functional. 
---
I‚Äôm just curious as to how it happened, and if it‚Äôs something that happens fairly often or if it was triggered by a player/hack/exploit. 
---
he does have it, it can be that someone got it before you did. you have to server hoop.
---
respect for going over there at LVL15, team up with someone when you want to do that. 
---
i have also seen the plans on watoga plaza, if you made to harpers then you should be able to make it to watoga but I wouldnt sugest it. 
---
the plans if a remember correctly i around 1,4k caps.
---
last thing what system do you play on, im willing to help you roam the land safely.
---
Unless you have some trades
---
I believe the workshop PVP bounty is only 5 caps though, please can someone confirm?
---
Now you have me thinking and it hurts. I gotta see if the 15 round mag weighs the same as the drum now when I log back in.
---
126 hours??????My first 2 nukes were launched in the first 40 hours.What took you so long?
---
Oh no
---
I spent the first 23 years of my life growing up in WV and I have to admit I have now learned even more about my home state thanks to Fallout 76! It makes me want to re-visit (and visit for the first time!) a lot of places around the state. This video is so accurate to the details of the game! And hearing them sing "Country Roads" toward the end brings a teardrop to my eye.
---
I hope they put in the home decorating in it today

I bought it on my level 138 either in Watoga at Phoenix or Harpers Ferry. Phoenix seems to sell a lot of high level weapon plans.

Did you read the post or just the picture and title? He explained this.

---
Keeping the items I pick up and equip before a server disconnect. 
---
The funniest thing is to in order, pick up a 2-3 * legendary item, catch radworms, use a disease cure. Get disconnected from the server. Relogin, the legendary item is gone, I have radworms again and my disease cure is gone also.
---
It‚Äôs all fun in games till someone whips out a Tesla or LMG.
---
the nicest people live in small towns, metropolis's are cancer incarnate.
---
well, that would be the highlight if survival mode is not a fresh character,
---
It does, though like I said in my previous comment, every once in a while I'll see someone who isn't flagged as an event team member. No idea why it happens though.
---
Movement speed increase only, not much else.

6.5 hours from me. I‚Äôve got some Swiss ancestry too so this would be rad.

I made a new post, the discord link removed it. Are you interested?

This is really cool! I love how bethesda knows the regional history and research that goes into these games!

I'm certain he is. I would fucking die of joy if they made a fallout game in my neck of the woods.

likewise. not exactly what you would expect when it says it goes til the 26th.
---
OMG nice...a mask swarm :)
---
I‚Äôve seen him east of Charleston Station, and just outside The Rusty Pick, SW of the fire dept. 
---
Certainly sounds interesting.
---
I was just wondering yesterday how accurate to the town Bethesda was. Seemed particularly small to me. Looking like Bethesda was spot on though. 
---
i know this is a joke, but if anything this is proof that people are capable of doing illegitimate things with in game items. these masks are atom shop purchases and are not able to be dropped. this further raises the question of the legitimacy of the handful masks that people have spotted.
---
Sad thing about this Reddit sometimes, I couldn't tell this was satire at first.  Lol
---
"Confirmed"
---
All this demand for evidence from a group of folks who cannot provide evidence that they have run the missions as many times as they say.
---
Whine all you want, but until Bethesda admits there was an issue with the masks dropping, this is armchair speculating from a group of people who find a new cause to rally about every patch. Its entitlement 101. "I bought the game, so I deserve the ultra rare item and if it is too rare, then Bethesda needs to make it easier for me"
---
Pretty sure you can even get a slightly used one these days as well.
---
I here ya bro...too many times have i dropped from the game at the worst moment and lost Junk/loot etc..after all these patches, it still does this to me way to often.
---
Yeah? I've only done the Queen 3 times. 
---
Maybe it's a come in late thing?
---
West Virginia is freaking gorgeous. Fully enjoyed my time there several years ago. Be proud!
---
Wait. There are challenges that promote substance abuse? If that is true Bethesda needs to take it out and apologize for promoting something that can easily rob someone of their lives. I know of several recovering or recovered alcoholics and also of those (some close to me) that have died due to it.
---
thats what the guy is talking about though. he said if you finish the miners miracles quest via a friend you wont be able to build excavator armor. which i did since i remember receiving a power armor station plan after completeing that quest.
---
Is the Professional Drinker perk not worth while? I use that and Party Girl and I'm digging the drinking dailies. 
---
Happy cake day 
---
How about stop becoming so attached to your camp where it causes you to stop suggesting shitty ideas. 
---
That was my friend! He‚Äôs been into fallout since the first games, and we‚Äôve been going to fasnacht for the last 6 years. Needless to say it was very exciting when we found out about the game. 
---
it's surprising as Beth games since Fallout 3 have generally had decent variety but the only dreads I've ever seen in this series were on the White Legs and Ulysess. Would definitely like to see some twists and braids going on as well. 
---
Yeah, it was planned to happen right up until Sony threw a temper tantrum (mostly about Fortnite and Minecraft, but FO76 got caught in the crossfire). Bethesda wants it as much as we do.
---
Completely agree, I just don't do them anymore, it's boring and not fun. Much preferred the old challenges.
---
Also, why do plasma cartridges weigh 6x more than fusion cells (0.030 vs 0.005) while the guns are very comparable in damage profiles.
---
I think there are just a few weird gaps like this that slipped through in the development process.
---
I am yet to encounter insult bot
---
Maybe but i would only want it between the console versions and not PC because of the different input methods, different settings and hackers/modders etc
---
Ive looked for a way to switch it off. Lol
---
The DMV in Charleston has a terminal entry for registering so maybe you can have a Mr. Handy in the future.
---
The deathclaw mask was my friend, and I‚Äôm in the bender mask! The real fasnacht is amazing
---
probably we misunderstood, maybe due to translation from my game which is in a different language. I did lode bearing lot of time ago, I dont even remember what that quest was about.
---
Anyways, I'm talking about the Credit (or Token) which looks exactly the same as Mr fuzzy credit. I usually find them near arcade machines in amusement parks. And I'm sure 100% they have always had a 0 weight cos I was keeping them in my inventory with all the other 0 weight items like notes or holos
---
It was still on this morning, but finished around 11:30 GMT.. 
---
"Geth...hick....offf....hick.....myyyy.....hick.....lawm, youth pethky kidth! Hick!" Blam! blam!, "Oopsth, that wath a Glowning Deethclw!"
---
Initially, Duping, and now the market have degraded the game.  too easy to buy everything you need, and thats why i was hoping for lvl 1 survival mode with NO trading allowed, and dropping stuff doesnt leave a bag.
---
That would be awesome!
---
Hell and damn, I was hoping to get in a few runs this afternoon. 
---
Veil of Secrets reduces rads?
---
To be fair I'm 140 and didn't realize the veil reduces rads. Ugh 
---
I've had the flatwoods monster spawn three times in the same spot next to my camp. It's in the mire.
---
ok, um, then dont take it?  problem solved? but yeah,i guess thanks so much for posting your...um... insight?
---
nerf melee!
---
I'm sure they will bring it around eventually. They are aware that this is probably THE most desired skin in the game, and it will make them some serious money to reintroduce it back into the atom shop. 
---
Interesting to see what ‚Äúrandom aid items‚Äù along with junk you drop upon death
---
That XBox **not delete all the photos from my album this time**? I forgot to screenshot all my fashnact pics last night before I logged out.
---
Or bring everything else back up inline. Every point of strength adds damage to melee. Why not do the same with perception 
---
My friends and I have been going to fasnacht for the last 6 years. It‚Äôs really an amazing time, and if you ever get the chance, make the trip. It‚Äôs always the Saturday before Ash Wednesday. 
---
By the way, my friend is in the Deathclaw mask, and I‚Äôm in the bender mask.  
---
Workshops have a set amount of scrap you can use once you claim it. Once that scrap is gone it will pull from your scrap. 
---
When you are using the workshops it will be green on the amounts. When it‚Äôs your scrap it will be red.
---
I've never had any interest in drug and alcohol challenges. My son thinks they are hilarious. 
---
The nixie clock can't be placed in tents (like a few other decorations) so now I have two alarm clocks hanging from the roof of my tent that I also can't move or scrap without having to completely rebuild my camp. Very annoying.
---
No, that‚Äôs a campfire.
---
Thats something new - veil of secrets have any additional benefits? I've finished the Order of mystery questline and never used any items anymore - where can find additional info about it?
---
I just don't trust the servers not to quit when I'm doing something like that.
---
It not really a faction.  More of a loose conglomeration of players that identify with the peaceful, relaxed disposition of the Mega Sloth.
---
Mostly pacifist, but bother us and we will throw a big ass rock at your head.  
---
umbelievable, after reading your post i went to give it a try... it triggered! 
---
Tried yesterday night too and nothing...
---
They should be in paper bags if they were dropped by a player, even if they weren‚Äôt just destroyed on dropping. 
---
Odd that these seem to have been spawned in somehow. 
---
Then your build sucks. 
---
I think the guy here knows his stuff and I agree.
---
I actually think plans should be account bound and not character bound. I'm PvPing with a highlevel character, a unreasonable thing to do, because my lamps and my tables and my amazing concrete planters.
---
I feel your pain. I play solo and waited until I felt strong enough to do it alone(lv 76). I made it all the way to almost the end where you had to fix the power boards. 2 other players came in and the sentry bot etc respawned. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing and the lower level player launched the nuke. We defended the boys and when it launched they disappeared and I stayed there. They did send a join team request that I couldn‚Äôt accept. So I decided to fast travel to the nuke spot and the blue screen appeared. Still have the launch a nuke request active as I didn‚Äôt launch the nuke. I‚Äôm not even going to bother trying again as it used up to many supplies and was a right pain.
---
Some items do drop like this, I accidentally ended up with the monster mash mask and it dropped like this, I think it's untradable items maybe
---
Counterpoint: 
---
It was a lighthearted event - watching some of the other people was quite entertaining.  Yea, I would have liked the jester mask to go with my clown outfit, but no joy.  
---
The Sloth at the end bugs were annoying, but I still managed to get what, for my character level, were several good legendary weapon drops from the sloth - and some nice armor for completing the event.
---
To that end, the event worked out well for me.
---
Ok that's just stupid. Why not stay in Appalachia where all bigot humans are dead and you have the entire land for yourself rather than a Museum in a hostile DC? NF ghouls would honestly be appropriate NPCs in this game. 
---
You fool, WISE Mothman is the one true lord! He blesses us with a 5% experience boost withva humble iffering of light! All other Mothmen are false prophits!
---
Yup! I just finished a pretty sweet build, had to delete the 11 crops i had so i could actually put minimal furnishings. Still looks pretty bare and im pretty upset about it. Actually, really upset. I dont understand the CAMP size if im not able to utilize it.
---
They either need to stop being so stingy with the budgets, or they need to lower the server sizes so i can build the way i want. I interact with attempting to build more than i interact with the ~23 players.
---
This is explained as 5.56 being more prevalent than 7.62 and there fore  easier to get.
---
They will really drop the ball on an awesome opportunity to reinvigorate the game with a lvl 1 for all, and NO trading/dropping.  imagine that...all players equal expect for experience and luck.
---
Hmm I keep hearing about rivets and need to do some research.
---
Are we sure this is real? I'm seeing a distinct lack in mega sloth. 
---
For people who didn't participate in the event it'll have some value for sure. But it's difficult to judge how big...
---
Sounds great. I‚Äôm a pacifist. I own a saloon like the one if fallout new Vegas and I just give away free whiskey. How can I join this group and have the title of mega sloth like you do
---
Lode bearing was in a collapsing mine. The claim tokens have had 0.1 weight since beta. They've always been separate from the mr. Fuzzy claim tokens, which have always been 0.0 weight. 
---
We know.
---
That's why don't see anybody taking them anymore.
---
The griefers have ruined that part of the game as well.
---
The owner should 100% ***ALWAYS*** have the option to abandon the workshop if another player starts to take it.
---
Save them for when we get player vendors
---
I don't believe Veil of Secrets protects from radiation. There is no evidence to support that statement.
---
I enjoyed it too, but people sitting in the area to get the rewards, all while not helping, made me want to bash in a couple of folks with my axe! 
---
we really need a shitpost tag for these
---
Build more L√§mps.
---
Same, have a three star combat rifle I turned into a sniper and with all its mods (with 90% weight reduced) is 15.5. AND further more it‚Äôs damage is almost up to what a shotgun with no mods is. üò∂
---
&gt;I wish they would have just had everybody start over a new character because I would have played survival mode then.
---
And what difference would that make long-term?   Three months from now you have level 30 characters in the same world with level 100 characters stacked with legendary weapons/ armor and no restrictions on PVP.
---
 Which I'm guessing is what the people making this argument are actually hoping for. 
---
I raid workshops all the time and contest them for PVP. A few days ago I was just about to contest Grafton Steel when I noticed all the work the person put into it. I dropped a bunch junk, gave a thumbs up and promptly left. There is no way I could afford that upkeep.
---
Really? Do you have a mic?
---
I'm pretty sure the weight here is purely for balancing purposes. That's why adding a long barrel will *reduce* weight for many weapons. Back in fallout 4, the handmade was extremely powerful but was balanced with an exclusive ammo type and ridiculous weight. It also needed some really stupid perks to mod properly, but that was all nuka world weapons, not just the handmade.
---
In this game it's even stronger compared to most other weapons, and uses even more common ammo, so I guess the weight is somewhat justified. We should still have a rifle weight reduction perk though
---
Yes and if you want more you need to by it from the atomic bot unfortunately :(
---
I got two in before 6 a.m.
---
When you visit the same locations all over again :)
---
Watoga train station sells it as well, and would be a much safer place for a low level. Hope you've been saving screws, I went through 4-500 unlocking all of the mods.
---
It has saved my ass at least twice, so far :)
---
they are purged
---
ESO made some insanely huge changes to their base game. I'm not convinced that FO:76 is going to do the same.
---
Very helpful. I didn‚Äôt fully understand it either
---
So if you go to the front page and click in the three dots in the upper right corner and select user flair you can put the mega sloth logo next to your name.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much it.
---
no, its very difficult to get great legendary stuff w/o the market/trading. Your build (perks) mean nothing w/o the right gear which many players have do to the market and trading.
---
&gt;What‚Äôs the point of survival mode when everyone is going to be running around already unkillable with TSE weapons and bloodied weapons?
---
As opposed to being unkillable three months from now when their 'new' characters are now level 100 and are able to prey upon level 20 characters who are just starting out?  You know, because everyone is forced to start a new character in survival? 
---
We finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew the horns! Damn you. God damn you all to hell.
---
From the lore? It appears so.
---
Fictional doesn't mean you automatically throw out any elements of realism, I think they still need to strive for as much realism as they can without hindering the enjoyment of the game, it increases immersion in the game world.
---
I can see using weight to balance sniper type rifles and mods that make them into that, but the midrange rifles are pretty mediocre damage dealers, the Handmade is a good gun and my favorite rifle but I can't see it needing this weight for balance reasons. (granted I don't at all use VATS, so maybe I'm missing something)
---
I carry 1 handmade and 3 shotguns that weigh less in total, I only really use 1 of those shotguns but it's cheaper than wasting stash weight because of the perk.
---
Yeah whats the deal? 
---
Pacifism extending to CAMPS has been teased but isnt included in todays update. 
---
Pacifism changes so you cannot take SLAP dmg starts today. 
---
But if your a pacifist and own a workshop you are killable.
---
You cannot return SLAPs with Pacifism on now?
---
Its a slow process.
---
This is a better location for a low level, and it's where I got them. You always spawn right next to the station with almost no risk from enemy attacks. I don't know if hopping is necessary, but before they made plans more static at vendors (and before the major price bump), I had to hop five times to get it.
---
Is it already done? I thought Fasnacht would be going until the update this morning.. Hoped to hop on this morning and have another run or two but haven't found any servers where it's active. :/
---
I carry 1 handmade and 3 shotguns that weigh less in total, I only really use 1 of those shotguns but it's cheaper that wasting stash weight.
---
Its the new currency. Its not duped and there are only a limited supply.
---
A TSE is going for 25 witch masks right now
---
Naw, what's crappy is all the stink made over a cosmetic item that people will use to brag about and then forget they have in a few weeks. Or they wanted one to sell for caps or real life money. 
---
I mean, there was so much more stuff about Fasnacht that was *waaaaaay* better than some fun-for-a-while mask. Like the recipes, the camps items, the beret. All of which can be used all year round. 
---
Right?!?!?
---
No bounty. You lose your level in caps on death
---
But that is exactly what i am asking bro! Why is it decent at best? What gets worse in the end game? If you can critique please do that is exactly what i am looking for
---
üòÅ
---
The Veil of Secrets works like a gas mask, meaning it protects from airborne hazards. It does not protect from radiation.
---
...is exactly what someone would say if they are the kind of player who enjoys leveling people's CAMPs for no reason.
---
I agree. Weights are not accurate. What's worse is they have a tendency to fluctuate. I don't get that.
---
Oh cool
---
It should be so everyone starts on a level playing field
---
I saw one person with a skull. That's it.
---
I have enough leftover fashnact plans, recipes and masks to fully kit 10 alts, let alone the 4 I can have.
---
Pretty sure it's over before that even. Reloaded into about five servers. No balloons no robots no nothing......
---
You guys are a bunch of cry babies, a lvl 5 with a pipe pistol can just sit in front off vault 76 and kill you as soon as you come out. 
---
Everything else you can find/buy
---
You guys fail to see the same shit will happen no matter what. Why do you think other games that have pvp whipe the server on a regular basis that's the fix not starting from lvl 1. 
---
What happens if a have 10 hours a day to play for a week and then after a week of me playing you start playing, is the same thing. 
---
In a week off playing 10 hours a day for a week I will be lvl 50 or higher with legendary weapons and gear. Essentially the same thing that will happen now. 
---
Time is a bigger factor than weapons and anything else, if you know where/who to look you will find the stuff easily. 
---
I for one don't have any items that I haven't found/crafted myself, but what I have done is for the last 2 month's is work on my pvp character. 
---
With that said I would start from 0 if I had to, but the problem with stay the same after a few days.
---
For once I just want a patch that doesn't add more weird bugs.
---
Just walk around with a bunch of spoiled meat on you and nothing else. So much disappointment to whoever kills you. 
---
Addictal cures that right? If so on Xbox 500 caps starting bid
---
Nah you carebears are ruining the game. Alot of us didnt buy this game to hold everyones hand and look at trash on the geound together. 
---
We are playing against you.
---
I think if okay, I will just get the PA myself. Thank you though.
---
I'm on PC so I'm waiting for the Steam players to sell mine
---
As I was going though your post history to see if you were selling any really special mask from the event, I found this and desided to answer even though it'ts few days old post.
---
On PC I've seen some level 900+ guy, about a month or two ago. He must have seriously used some XP glitch and autokey macro. Between him, maybe the second highest level has been about 300. I've seen several about 220-260. All those seem very possble without any glitches, Im personally level 170 or so and have spent great deal of time just exploring and looting, which doesn't give that much XP. Levels 100 to 200 are fairly common.
---
I did take a screenshot or two of the guy, but I can only look for recent about 7-14 days of screenshots, as I'm currently at 3345 screenshots. 
---
did some searching, claim token is exactly what you say, they can be used in the machine. But I'm talking about the normal 'Token' (no Claim, no Fuzzy), which u can find in camden park scattered around arcade machines.
---
Are they useless? I guess they are not considered like 'Claim tokens'.
---
I bet the tourism board of West Virginia has never loved video games more than they do right now. 
---
I only git mugged once with two shot explosive stuff while using a workshop. The PVP initially wasn‚Äôt the trouble. It was just having no hope against that explosive weaponry that was the real turn off. Hopefully survivor mode will make owning workshops in adventure mode a bit safer. 
---
When camps get wrecked in survival, I'm betting *that* carries over to Adv as well.
---
Wonder why I see lots of bounty only at 5caps....people can‚Äôt be that poor surely?
---
Certain items like the monster mask and these ones drop as the actual items 
---
You can add me as well. PSN : makeitrana 
---
Evidently some areas have Airborne radiation, because it definitely makes a difference.
---
I'm cool with the rare mask drop rate. If you got one, its because you're lucky, not because you gamed the drop rate through server hopping and grinding.
---
Sorry dude /:
---
I would but I get DC'd constantly while using workshops. 
---
Because a lot of time and effort went into Fallout 4, but they still had to fudge the numbers a bit to try to balance the guns. Meanwhile the Fallout 76 team just threw stuff in, played with numbers, and didn't contemplate how any of this would work in practice. 
---
Awesome job, I love it. 
---
Same i was hoping that i could play the last 2 hours playing the parade till the servers go down for the next update. Instead i just spent 1.5 hours server hopping to unsuccessfuly find nothing
---
I miss so much of this game, thanks to my roaring tinnitus. It  does suck. 
---
(Oh, and invest in good earplugs for rock concerts, young people-- Guitar Center has awesome ones. You dont want this shit. Trust me.)
---
Your toll has been paid.
---
did you swap weapons in the midst of a ghoul swarm or on a lagging server? My quad harpoon gun often ends up with an ammo load of 250 if I swap out to a fully loaded 50cal in a brown trouser moment. It does reset back to the normal 4 rounds once empty though. Cant reload while above 4 either.  
---
Y'know, people say "Oh, just buy so-and-so weapons and so-and-so armor, it's *easy*."
---
Yes, it is easy mode when you don't have to work for it.  If you're just playing the game itself and not using the aftermarket, it's very difficult to come by such things.  Some, like you, would probably go "Suck it up, that's part of the game!" and all I can say is I hope you enjoy your time in Survival playing with a bunch of others just like you.
---
Full purchased top end sets dont buy you a victory. You still need to know how to use them correctly. People know how to defeat sentinals/cavaliers/assasin/unyielding. 
---
Trust me. Ive got a set. I still suck. 
---
Agreed. We need lots more emotes in fact.
---
PC, sorry I should've clarified.

Yeah, who knows, but at least someone else has seen this weird behavior. But this patch means it's a non-issue now yay üòÄ
---
I get your point, but at least everyone would start and 0 and work there way up...if they get to 100 and are unkillable w/o the market/trading, then Kudos...they deserve the dominance, and maybe low lvl's could gang up on those people.
---
that is a popular nuke spot
---
It was a lot of fun and legit props to everyone at Bethesda working hard to make awesome new content! It was however disappointing to find out on reddit after grinding for hours that the chances of getting a rare mask is next to impossible. Like there is one person playing the game that got an old man winter mask (unconfirmed?) and they are so rare that no one walked away with any of the others?
---
Good I want to keep my current player for it
---
Apparently it's as hard as installing a standard online game feature like a damned text chat system, that was introduced to the industry over 30 years ago.
---
Lotion for its skin.
---
Break the syringer ammo down into diluted chems! 
---
You ruined your own part of this game by not understanding simple game mechanics and a pop up warning that warns you.
---
Balloons are still there for me on PC, they just take forever to load in.
---
Yeah, everyone was looking for those or did you not keep up with this sub?
---
Is that just closing the game or actually logging out of the launcher?
---
No. Just only carry what your willing to lose.
---
Caps are cheap. Lose 900 a day. Test the waters. It should be fun. Dont be scared!
---
I will be roleplaying in survival since carebear requests are ruining roleplay in Adventure. I dont wanna roleplay with someone who knows they are invincable. No fun. 
---
Yeah. And they should release A LOT of new ones at once for free. Not 2 or 3 for 1500 atoms. They should be throwing in more small customization items more often. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt. Just airborne hazards. 
---
I'm hoping it comes out already! To be honest, though, I like the idea someone else brought up about seasons for the mode. That once season starts you get your new character, and then when the season ends and starts again you have to start with a new character.
---
loved the event, but are they going to bring back the event some day? I still have some missing CAMP plans....
---
I get your point, but it will remove the duped items, and the market from the picture...I'll gladly be killed by somebody who legit earned their power, and work my way up.
---
When I first played it it was quite expensive, not working well and on a launcher that is so bad it doesn't even have a friend list option. 
---
With the steam release all of these things would get better
---
I dont have much of an issue with it. Its been nuked twice and its mostly just concrete and wood to repair, which I have plenty of. Most of the time my camp sits right outside the zone. Other times I ditch the server.

*you have become addicted to addictol*

if you don't have the perk (Im level 10 and have two mutations I want), whats a good way to get rid of rads without radaway or decon arch?
---
Between this and the McElroys, I'm in.
---
Just log out and log back in. You don‚Äôt need to close the game. Every time you log in you get put in a different world do vendors will have different stuff. 
---
I was gonna say... is this some obscure mechanic I didn't know about? üòã
---
That why I like the game, you have a variety of ways you can play, I have a character who doesn‚Äôt use any chems or alcohol, only what he can kill, and the water he can boil it purify himself 
---
I frankly don't see a push-to-talk setting - I'm on Xbox.

I can set my mic to be area, or team, or auto.  I have no idea if anybody can hear me - but I also find it weird that I've never heard anybody else... ever.  Do I have to be *on a team with people* to hear them, even if they're speaking to the area?  I've literally seen a mic icon near people's name with the word "area", indicating they ARE talking .... but I hear no voices... wtf?
---
I thought by "Other players may initiate PVP" they meant initiate PVP with other players, not me! This is the digital equivalent of rape. I am literally shaking.

For this game? Hell. No.

They need to fix the game in general first and they are taking good strides to do so. Adding cross play would fuck all that up. Not to mention the balancing issues aswell.
---
How could he headshot you if you didn't retaliate to initiate combat?
---
I mean, you dont even need to engage pvp. You can treat others as random glowing deathclaw. Run away. Hide. Etc. It's all viable and you get to enjoy the bonus. If anything this mode should be more realistic for "survival" game. 
---
Me me me,  running around with a rolling pin and the chef hat!!!
---
They are accidental bounyies. *woops i broke a thing* ... Picked a lock. Etc.
---
Or they are "cap condoms" which is intentionally getting a small bounty so you *only* lose 5 caps on death, opposed to your level.  Someonething you may do if you are pvping at someone elses camp  
---
That‚Äôs a dime irl 
---
I figured it would have at least gone until the 10:00am update shutdown.
---
It's giving every "too" access to 200 lbs of your stuff.. . not all of your stuff. I'm not sure you follow. You don't need to result to insult because you can't grasp the concept. I have a character that cooks. Maybe I'd like to give all my characters access to the food he makes, rather than find food on each individual character. Maybe I'd rather share my drugs from my pharma farmer with all my characters, rather than diverse points to be jack of all trades on each character. Maybe I'd rather my heavy guns character get to use the 3* Gatling Gun I picked up on my rifle character. I do all the aforementioned things now. It's just clunky, sketchy and all around difficult. I don't consider that cheating. It's just like trading and giving stuff  to your friends.
---
I have done Uranium fever many times without Power Armor, and wearing the Veil.
---
Until last night I have never needed to use more than 1-2 radaways, and last night I used more than 10.
---
I have also had friends ask me how I survive the Rads in the Sundew groves without PA or Hazmat, and I tell them about the Veil.
---
The effect is the same as a Gas Mask, but without the loss of Perception.
---
That 'level playing field' will last a week max. 
---
260 levels, never had issues with rads at uranium fever. Never used any armor pieces with rad resist. Just don't stand beside the extractors? lol.
---
Well if you don't want the withdraw effects then yeah it's worth it lol 
---
Ouch.  I only gave it two or three hops, and figured it was dead since none of them had the festive decorations.  I admire your dedication.
---
The problem though is that there is sitll a reward for killing people in survival mode, thus there will be less roleplay and more KOS.
---
You can test it yourself. Go to a place with some rads and compare your rad intake with or without the veil.
---
It protects from airborne harards, including some diseases, so maybe you caught a disease.
---
awwww man, i was hoping to get a few runs in after work today. :( :( :(
---
I tried at 6:20am CST, and it was not to be.
---
It‚Äôs hard to see them having much future value when all the players are sitting on as many masks as you if not more. My plan was to wait until October for Halloween to sell the 60+ I have but I‚Äôm not sure I even feel like holding onto them that long haha. 
---
Alright, thanks. Will do, since it puts me within decent running distance of the vendor when I spawn, just gotta avoid the Super Mutant Primus that always seems to be there.
---
&gt;The effect is the same as a Gas Mask, but without the loss of Perception.
---
Yep. Happened to me.
---
Not needed. I‚Äôm just one man with a dream to see a good game shoot for the stars. 
---
I'd like to see a spiral staircase 
---
..losing my hard found caps is the only drawback I see at this point.
---
Earn your power in survival mode, and i'll bow to you, and it will encourage ppl to gang up thus making it more fun for both the "God" and the ants.
---
Yesterday I had someone(lvl 100+) continuously snipe me(lvl20) during the entire parade. As soon as I‚Äôd revive, he/she did it again. Worst. Parade. Ever. Thanks to all who tried to shield me from the attacks! 
---
Imo they're worthless. I kept 2 of each on the off chance they're wanted by anyone since I'm still missing the hanging snowflake plans
---
Anyone who cares about them has them already, and realistically there wont be many new players coming in, and of there are any who want the masks they were so common that everyone has them for trade anyway.
---
Fasnaught being a yearly event doesnt help its chances at becoming rare items either l, it's likely bethesda will just put them back into the event next year with (hopefully) other masks.
---
Maybe
---
The weird thing is he didn't ask for skull, goblin, or sun....... does this imply that he has those masks already O.O
---
I figured since I've fought level 60 scorched and mole miners at Pleasant Valley (iirc) Cabins alone and the place where you get the parts for the top of the world quest (not Horizons Rest) and did make it to Top of the world on my own, fighting through/running from Deathclaw Matriarchs and high level scorched and sentry bots I could make a run to Harper's ferry just fine. 
---
..if only we could re-skin the explosive bait as explosive CAKE!
---
It's not about what you think or what you consider or anything about what you want. It's about what the devs want for the game. It's their vision not yours. Clearly they don't want this or it already would have been part of the game. You insulted me first dipshit, and yes I understand completely what you're saying. It is you who doesn't understand whats being said.
---
Thanks for the encouragement and the ideas!
---
Pshh, I don‚Äôt need alcohol to rock a dress in game. 
---
Carebear requests?
---
As hard as adding a ‚Äúchange character‚Äù option.
---
I'm looking for the hanging snowflake plans if you have them spare. I have pretty much all the other plans avalible to trade for it
---
Content vulture is a term I like
---
Lol, I played anthems beta, it‚Äôs not worth it if I don‚Äôt have friends who are willing to buy it also.
---
Which platform are you on?  I've got a few extra donut recipes.
---
I'm trying to get the plan so I can preferably continue making them as I increase in level to keep up with tougher enemies. No clue how to increase the level of things I craft, because as of right now my only options for crafting guns are level 1 pipe guns.
---
Or you know, stick to adventure if you aren't geared for PvP?
---
Maybe with a group... I‚Äôm not a fan of doing solo nuke launching because it‚Äôs kinda boring. But a good idea nevertheless.
---
Bethesda made a great game. Folks like you are ruining it. Leave your emotions out of a rated MA game. Go play minecraft.
---
Its a goddamn wasteland. Im not your team. Im not your friend. Im playing *against* you 
---
This community is too soft. Roleplay is about to die from pacifist changes. I dont wanna roleplay with invincible players. No danger = No excitement. Ill be roleplaying in survival now. 
---
Thanks carebears.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, I can launch one with you, done it once already and don‚Äôt feel like doing it alone again.
---
&gt;  they could be charged
---
Huh?  Charged with what?  By who?
---
RNGesus has spoken to him
---
I can't buy atoms in my region. So I go gulp down booze and be an alcoholic to get the dime. Poor me:(
---
I‚Äôd like a ‚Äúeat‚Äù option when we find food in the wastes. That way I would not have to dig through my pip boy to eat the snack I‚Äôve just picked up
---
Dang dude, nice job on the 200
---
I hoard desk fans, and I usually just grab every piece of junk I find and have screws marked for search so I can find them easier. The real thing I have issues with is springs.
---
I will do some testing tonight, but I'm sure it make a difference in some areas.
---
Does anything exist telling what these random encounters consist of? Known items/plans etc. ? 
---
You don't have enough caps. That plan Costs around 1500 caps.
---
Abso-freakin'-lutely!
---
I would love specific crossplay, where you can join a different platform‚Äôs servers only if you are part of a team on that server. 
---
I'm on PC
---
Like OP, I used to be in the military. My first assigned machine gun was a MK19, the auto grenade launcher in game. That isn't a weapon you attempt to fire from the hip. But here we are holding some L bracket on the side like it's entirely possible. There's countless other examples, but rather than letting this knowledge hinder how I experience the game I just try to understand the design choices and their reasoning. I have a couple rifle builds, and I think this system is fair.
---
Except pistols. Pistols just suck way too bad and it's a neglected weapon class.
---
It‚Äôs all CAMP and cosmetics.  I go for camp items first, then power armor paints.  
---
Yeah, better take out the guns, and the monsters - those can kill too.
---
/s
---
I've also had friends die from ODing, but, *the very point of a video game* though, is to do things I wouldn't or couldn't do IRL.  
---
I hate bullet sponge enemies.
---
Thank you so much.
---
yes, thats what the roadmap says...dont know details yet.
---
It's all cosmetic, it is either an item for your camp or a paint or an outfit.
---
But that's just the thing, I dont think the Handmade in Fallout 76 is the Russian built AK. The name "Handmade" just gives off the feeling that the gun is supposed to be made by hand and not made of high quality materials, so my guess is that the Fallout version closely resembles the Chinese version.
---
Gonna be honest, with Gunsmith rank 5, I repair my .50 cal like once a week now. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but... not really a downside. It does cost a small countries net worth to fire it all day though.
---
Pacifism extending to camps. Pacifists becoming invincible...
---
Yup the maintenance later is for the update :3
---
I found one like that ... forget exactly where I was - somewhere along  the eastern side of the savage divide, IIRC.  I want to say south of the big monorail track w/ the elevator...couldn't walk across the track, too overencumbered to FT, sheer cliffs, so so had to walk S around the mountain.  
---
When I finally could head W, found a vault...big platforms outside.
---
I haven't checked it out since energy weapons got a buff (plasma and laser gun are decent), but probably nothing. There's not enough attention thrown to auto pistols whatsoever and this class needs a re-work. Maybe more damage, but def more variety.
---
What? A lv100 with bloodied TSE will 1 shot 10 lv3 at a time. 
---
Why is it hard for some people to understand that force new char in survival is a terrible idea?
---
Lunchmeat lol sounds about right 
---
&gt; If people play 100 times they should get all rare masks
---
That's absurd.  That's not "rare".
---
&gt; They could get a fine.
---
For what?
---
You don't really have to in order to see Unyielding's effects.  I think it starts kicking in around the 50-60% HP mark.  If you had a full set of Unyielding, that's still an across-the-board +1 SPECIAL to every point (except END) and it only goes up from there.
---
IMO, it probably ends up being the type of 1\* armor, because endgame enemies have anti-armor properties that render Vanguard and Bolstering moot, the enemy-specific armors are kind of pointless, and Auto-Stim has a perk card equivalent that works better (Born Survivor).
---
WE NEED TO BAN VIOLENT VIDEOGAMES LIKE FORTNITE: THE MOSQUE SHOOTERS PLAYED FORTNITE!!! *confused screeching*
---
it's too hard
---
Wait for player vending.
---
They could have a perk called basic training, and it reduces rifle weight.  Or they could just reduce rifles.  Or make heavy weapons actually heavy, since they really ought to be both heavier and immensely more powerful.  Carrying a freaking minigun should be the only thing you get to carry, but on the same token you should be able to murder everything you come across with it.
---
I'm pretty sure this is another issue entirely. I've heard that protectrons and liberators will spawn instead of ghouls if only a low level player is in the area. It's like it got confused and loaded the low level enemies at a high level. The random encounters in the files seem to be the ones that occur around the perimeter and places like just south of the main building (where the supply drop happens). I'm at work now, but I seem to remember that the supply drops happen on the map in the same locations as the scene encounter spawn points. So that might be something else to use for mapping purposes.
---
I can make PvP viable power armor bloodied build, but I don't use it as I think my regular is still better. I deal the majority of my damage via heavy weapons. As of now I am yet to meet a player that could dominate my character, and I have no troubles at all with farming caps on anything thats currently considered meta.
---
I am not saying I am against buffing specific heavy weapons (mine doesn't need a buff at all) nor against buffing PA. But to say the game completely lacks balance is to say something untrue.
---
That's a fine camp my dude
---
Busted!
---
i dont want my headphones to unplug
---
Naked.
---
Rolling pin. 
---
Chef hat.
---
I was going to argue with you and then I realized I've been saying it / hearing it wrong my entire life. I blame my parents. We all have our blind spots lol.
---
Clipboards are your friend. You can usually find them in the same areas as fans too.
---
I took a break from crafting to unlock mods while the event was going on this week, and when I looked last night, I have 350 screws, and 500+ of springs/gears. 
---
Most I've ever had at one time. I don't use PA outside of rad zones, so I only ever use springs/gears.on workshop turrets, traps and generators.
---
I don't even run gunsmith on my weapons anymore because it's not worth wasting the perk points. Usually just better to throw a forceful stock on and leave it at that. Just keep three points in INT so you can use weapon artisan/fix it good and you'll be fine. Even my handmade with 25% faster fire rate holds up well enough on its own without active perks to fight against decondition.
---
Me and you both buddy. I just want a reduced weight Minigun, I don‚Äôt really care about the other effects. But no takers so far. Good luck on your sale!üòÅüëçüèº
---
I will likely be online around 5:00 pm CDT.  IGN:  Orphanclone
---
I'll meet you in Helvetia, mein freund.
---

---
Interim solution - Server hop?  
---
I dont do it very ften,but If I really want to get back to a specific event, I can generally get back to the same server in 3-4 hops. (PS4)
---
That could have been part of it, since Mole Miners were spawning in right beside the Center extractor, I was near it more than usual.
---
I will go back to Blackwater Mine and a Sundew Grove tonight and test thoroughly.
---
Wife and I were grocery shopping this weekend and on the side of a display there were bags and bags of plastic forks and spoons and i got real excited for a moment... My wife asked why i was so excited, i told her "look at all this plastic"!  so i took a break for a night lol
---
That would rock, thanks! See you then :-)
---
This bears repeating. Way to own it.  
---
Lol, griefers will feel so bad seeing my dreadful CAMP that they'll build it up and make improvements instead of destroying it.
---
Fine, they will kill many lower lvl people...but they EARNED it, and so will the lower people who lvl up. No trading/Dropping will eliminate the external market.
---
It may have been Vishnu‚ÄîI am become death, destroyer of worlds...
---
Well for a bloody heavy build, you want to have at least stabilized and nerd rage, but yeah, kinda agree. I've been debating where to spend those 5 points. Probably on pvp perks.
---
I'm working on making a list of these from the data mining I'm doing. See my post above. There are a lot. From memory, Objects have 40, Travel have 43, Scene have 50, and Assault have 20-something. 
---
\+1 Brand Consistency point
---
Fort mcclintock is your friend for springs. I grab all the clipboards and military bags.
---
Np, good luck!
---
I usually run these two, hop to my base in the middle, and then run the two for the civil war plans, server hop, and run the other direction. In 5-6 server hops, between the 4 locations, I usually get 1 spawn I want.
---
The lemonade vendor now spawns at these locations too, so I have several plans for that too.
---
Almost thought i seen this. I witnessed a guy go insane go to the top of the church tower and started killing players. And because it was explosive shot it looked like fireworks around me. Guess I didn't die cause I refused to return fire and wouldnt stand still.
---
Killed 4 people before they took him down. then they started launching mini nukes at that point im like f this shit im out
---
Ah here I thought the gas mask was only for polluted air. Ill have to try it out. I've kept it in my inventory this whole time. 
---
I have to keep the volume very low for the kids are sleeping: I support this idea

I have been server hopping on pc since about 830am.  Been working on stuff online and figured I would give it one last go.  But nope.  Le sigh.  So sad!  I still needed the donut recipe and I think one or two of the ribbon things.  Ah well.  It was nice while it lasted!  
---
I bought the camo paint from the atom store specifically for my t51b and it looks brilliant! 
---
Unless beth strikes a magical deal, it's definitely not gonna happen. If they allow you to port account, a large chunk of sales will be lost. Beth can do it out of good will but they dont have any actual reasons to.
---
I use them on camp items I think look really nice (Light wood laminate, clean items, knickknacks), Outfits that look cute or odd (Nuka-girl outfit, Moon mask, Dapper cloths), and finally on paint jobs since I don't notice them as much. 
---
I've never used them on icons or emotes unless on accident. 
---
Oops, I completely missed the event entirely... 
---
Bloodied build plus inattention to HP levels?
---
Ahhh, I see. I did have a level 9 I was helping out, he must have engaged back which made me fair game. Probably why I normally play solo. Great information man I appreciate it. I hope to see less greifers after the update. I love when people destroy my base for no reason. 
---
I regret buying all the poses i did. Now i spend it on camp items. Ill probs buy some facepaint for my pvp character. But yea i want a pretty camp now
---
Is there a resource you use online for tips/tricks or just conversation here on Reddit?
---
There is an object encounter in the dry river bed exactly halfway between the Gorge Bridge and the red railway bridge north of Charleston Station. It's directly east of the Creamery where you see a little inlet on the river on the map. There's a lone tree standing there in the middle of where the river used to flow and it's in the flat area on the south side of it.
---
It was cool the first day, but I've long since given up on the rare masks and lost my patience for it. And every time hte event is going, I can't fast travel, I can't interact with things in the world, loot doesn't spawn... just generally does awful things to the server. I won't be sad to see it go heh.
---
I've found:
---
spelling in reverse + bottom to top + assisting letters (removed afterwards)
---
will allow for decent placement. Huge hassle and still breaks when the camp is relocated.
---
You should be able to craft a higher level pipe gun. You don't upgrade a weapons level, you craft an entirely new higher level weapon.
---
Aah! A mole ra- oh sorry. Mistook you for something else..
---
I would be ok with heavier ammo if ranged weapons also dealt higher damage in relation to the weight increase.
---
Let ammo be more rare and expensive but highly effective. While melee saves ammo but is high risk.
---
Of Course. Just stay under lvl 5 and be the best 'long lived' player ever xD
---
pro-tea-pots
---
ofcourse I saw them, it was imposible not to see all the post about them. It doesnt hurt to ask, and I am always down for a trade. 
---
and did you not see the tittle from the thread? 
---
Hi, can I have one donut recipe please? I'm on PC and my username is KruxXxi. I will add you
---
I know, but I'm saving my caps for the black excavator PA paint when it is released. Or if they release that Nuka Cola lamp in the fraternity house...
---
Yea bud, just enlightening you lol. Just think about the saying. *Could* care less would mean they do care. *Couldn't* care less mean they don't care at all. The latter would be the saying you're going for.
---
What ever catches your eye. I grab camp items, pa paints, and I grabbed the moon mask because it looks awesome with my clean spaceauit.
---
that's an issue, yes, but how are you completely ignoring that a MINIGUN weighs less than an assault rifle?
---
Good stuff! Does anyone know how to use the Google Maps API to make something like [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com) ?
---
Not going to happen and that's not a diss to Bethesda at all. Making a game is wild and coding with out causing a bug seems near impossible for anyone.
---
A Boy and His Dog. 
---
Or would that make everyone sad that there‚Äôs no Dogmeat companion in this one?
---
Okay, cool. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Are you on a resource over there? I'm a rifle build so sitting on the lead resource is great. It actually generates more than I need, which fuels my caps a bit when I bulk sell.
---
Wot
---
what kind of slave-grind-lottery shit are you on? fuck a mask; i'm glad you didn't get one
---
Well, you certainly sound capable out there. Just a bit simpler at Watoga station for the easy hopping. At level 33, I haven't been anywhere on the east side of the map besides the station. I just crawled across the savage divide avoiding all potential threats (I really just wanted to get the damn plans).
---
Scorchbeasts are the worst due to their shitty loot tables.
---
Trivago Guy = Pedo?
---
We‚Äôve got nothing against tea pots üòÇ

Someone pointed out that they just demonstrated it inside an existing building, which is probably part of some buildable space in-game.  It's not a building you can construct yourself.

Martha - Entered Vault 76 as gifted but quiet child, exited Vault 76 as a brilliant but reserved adult. She‚Äôs taken up the Responders‚Äô cause in wanting to help Appalachia recover but is very socially awkward and uncomfortable around other people, often making her seem stony and unpleasant. Distrustful of robots and automation. 
---
Sylvia - Born to two overachieving parents, chafing under the constant supervision and rules of Vault 76 until she was released into the wastes. While she doesn‚Äôt actually want to hurt anyone, she‚Äôs a careless, carefree little shit who treats Appalachia like her own personal playground and doesn‚Äôt contribute to the effort to rebuild at all.
---
Juliette - A new arrival to Appalachia who seems too physically and emotionally soft to survive in the wasteland at first glance. She‚Äôs a jolly, kind-hearted farmer and a skilled cook who enjoys taking care of the people and animals who find their way to her doorstep, looking after them with a momma bear‚Äôs strength when need arises.
---
From a fairness perspective, they could make it a menu toggle option that turns off the sounds of all the perk cards like the caps one and make the controller vibrate in different amounts as you get closer, though that only helps if you're using a controller I guess 
---
Sameish.  I was doing the event solo.  Some dude put his camp behind the rad toad spawn.  I was vatsing the toads and it aimed at a turret.  Boom, I‚Äôm wanted for a measly 10 caps.  A bounty hunter pops in while I‚Äôm at the suiciders and kills me.  While reloading, a suicider ends 3/5 robots and I couldn‚Äôt agro the bugs solo and the other two died.  Mission failed.  I got mad and went to kill the bounty hunter who was at a camp nearby.  Turns out it was my buddy.  We trade, test damage and peace.  Lol Fallout 76.
---
Because they don't want to confuse new players I suppose. Ghouls=enemy. If there was a bunch of friendly ones it might confuse people a little. This is my first Fallout and think it's pretty good so far, just stepping over the plotholes.
---
i get you and im sure the will be a few assclowns that will just do that sit on the vault waiting for someone to 1 shoot them, but I did worked and im still working for my pvp build. 
---
with that said I am full aware that im going to get my ass handed to me a few times but hey its a learning phase thats all. 
---
and we will see how everyting will play out and im sure after a few/weeks they will be adjustments done to the mode. 
---
If you are on Xbox I could sell you some very decent legendaries.
---
I'd be curious if there will be an option to pay for leveling-up a piece of good armor you found in the past.
---
Eh.  I dumped the 308 LMG shortly after finding it...too heavy and for what I was dealing with at the time, 308 sniper is faster, takes less ammo, and is more effecive.   (red rocket mega stop mutants....LMG @ 11 dmg per shot, took 7-10 shots to take out a mutant)
---
308 sniper (90 dmg) and 2 shots to take out the same level mutant.
---
I keep a lot of 308 for sniping.
---
and 45....especially after getting both an executioners combat rifle and a supressed 45 SMG...both are quite effective close in if I am not melee-ing.
---
Gas masks dont protect from rads either and if you are wearing the VoS with power armor, doesnt that mean you are wearing it UNDER your power armor, thus making it null and void?
---
Yeah, would be cool. I just use the "arms waiving in the air" when I do something dumb. It seems to work most times.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. Do you guys play?
---
I run with gunsmith 5 as well all the time.  Mostly shotgun build, but also go back and forth between modded handmade rifle and Tesla rifle.  I rarely have to repair any of them, but it does raise an interesting debate ln whether or not it‚Äôs needed? 
---
With my shotgun perks/build they weigh about a pound each.  I‚Äôm maxed out in strength pretty much.  I flip the rifle perks when I want to use the handmade. 
---
For PvP you especially don't need them. Players die quick, so you shoot less. If you shoot less, your weapon breaks less often. My issue is resisting the temptation to take traveling pharm or thru hiker. 
---
It‚Äôs just the right way to play PVE in a multiplayer setting. The only exception is the AWOL event, when I only ‚Äòtag‚Äô the gutsys they easily overpower me and lower level players, they end up dying several times. So now I do my best to wipe out the crowd as fast as I can and only when the legendary (usually carrying a wood leg) shows up I slow down so everyone can get a few hits on it. 
---
I have 400 screws for sale on Xbox
---
Shit why didn‚Äôt anyone else think of this? You just found the cure for total hearing loss! ^/s
---
I figured it was going until the servers went down. Drat.
---
I put a ton of work into making my dude look like a basic facsimile of Peter Stormare(famous Swedish actor who plays a lot of Russians) for those not in the know) and I would like to show that off to people
---
Still looking for the plan after 300+ hours (I like them too!)
---
but why?  why can't they make the minigun weigh less than an assault rifle without touching ammo weights?
---
I'm hoping Bethesda admits there drop rate math mistake and allows us to do like a 5 or 10 mask turn in for a rare mask. They could use the new legendary vendor for it.
---
I would wear that sun mask everyday. 
---
you can after lvl 50, every time you lvl you will have to choose either picking a card or move a skill point. just two was to reskill, new character or wait after lvl 50.
---
that I know off that is. 
---
Be the change you want. Pick all the locks on the church anyway.
---
The server I'm on still has the decorations up which was why I guessed that the maintenance was when they would end it.  While the decorations remained,  haven't seen an event this morning.
---
Same! It was a lot of fun participating an event with a lot of people and I typically didn't like being around other players with just myself. 
---
nope thats all they are to buy character cosmetics and camp plans
---
At the moment the Ultracite does not have any paint schemes, though data-miners have found some that should be coming to an Atom Shop near you!
---
I mainly play on PC and I haven‚Äôt touched F76 on Xbox in a long while, but thanks for the offer! If you have any on Pc definitely hit me up
---
Tyler County is good for the natural wall. I love fortifying the Ammo plant, Berkeley Springs, and Monongah Power Plant. Would like to build an actual town at places like Grafton Steel, Lakeside Cabins, and Beckley Mine Exhibit
---
Some plans should be rare, whether due to quality or prestige, but they're not that great and you can't really show them off. 
---
What's that?

If you don't want to run bloodied, AA is probably the way I'd go for sbq.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen the masks drop in bags? 100% gonna try this with my 7000 owl masks when I get home!
---
I kill em with a Ultracite Gatling laser, been hunting them down in the cranberry bog recently for the combat challenge. I really enjoy the fight, since the fixed the sonic attack spam it‚Äôs enjoyable. I remember when I was low level I‚Äôd sneak around or run from them. But now I can tackle 2 or 3 at a time.
---
I do wish they dropped stable flux or something worthwhile, but the occasional rare weapon to scrap for mods is nice enough for me.
---
On the other me survival mode releases today
---
Furious explosive .50 cal is good for the queen. 
---
I think you should quit.. Why play something if you‚Äôre bored?
---
For anyone wondering where to get the original plans, I think they are sold at WhiteSprings.
---
Professional drinker helps a lot. may not prevent stupidity but will negate the downsides of booze addiction
---
Yes, it would be ineffective in PA, but I only use PA in Blast Zones, or when I want to jump down from  a very High place.
---
Hey follow me
---
My saddest moment in the game was when they nerfed explosive weapons. I had a killer auto explosive 50 cal and with dmg around 125 and it would decimate scorchbeast and crowds of enemies. Post nerf, I still have a decent 50 cal but it‚Äôs not even half the weapon it used to be and that‚Äôs depressing.  I rarely use it now only when I do SBQ events. 
---
Aside from picking an individual perk card each level, do we still get perk card packs every 5 level after 50?
---
I mean i know its not the solution you are looking for, but just make a note of one or two players on your server before doing anything like that and rejoin on them. I do this a lot when I'm leveling an alt and i see SBQ pop up, go swap chars and just rejoin on whoevers name stood out, and there's always someone named something ridiculous like GoAt LoVeR or whatever you remember easily 
---
I just saved up enough caps yesterday to buy this plan, but I couldn't find it at any of the vendors except Grahm who is near impossible to find. But now I don't think I will get it thanks to this post, saved me 9k caps and a lot of disappointment. 
---
&gt;yOu'Ll NeVeR sEe A sErVeR
---
Fallout76 is broken all over weather its on breaking shit down or trying to make caps .. they wonder why we keep asking for space for storage well if 1 there cap system allowed each and every account a chance to sell vs the 1- people that run thru the survers getting rich off the venders vs the rest of us left un able to play because our inventorys are full since we cant sell anything
---
Totally agree! The trde system  needs to be improved!  
---
I was scamed with this system, my bad i know! But  with some improvements .. 
---
A Norinco SKS from my experience tends to be cheaper and more common than a russian made SKS 
---
I have a beret that you can have my username is Torble will be online in a few hours 
---
When did the munitions factory get nerfed? Is that happening today?
---
Just do what I do, explore! I've found two caves and many other funny things with teddy bears so far, who knows whats still out there.
---
But shouldn't that apply for Protectrons and Mr. Handys? All are vendors, quest givers and yet some are hostile. Not to mention there's Grahm. I just think Bethesda writers created a bunch of plot holes in order to accommodate the mechanics of this game. It's a shame actually. 
---
It's already part of the game. 
---
&gt; It's just clunky, sketchy and all around difficult. 
---
If the prerequisite for what the devs want in the game is what it contained on launch, then what's the point to patches and DLC? I guess you prefer the release version, huh? I can't say too many people would rather play that than what we have now. 
---
Players make new suggestions all the time. The devs are supposed to cater to their games audience. Otherwise why are we even customers? Obviously if everyone want God Mode, that would't be very fun. My suggestion doesn't really break the game. I've already pointed out it's "in the game". This is a QOL suggestion at best. 
---
Last question. Who made you the eternal provisioner of future FO76 Updates?
---
Ahh razorgrain, how I hate you.
---
About 6 of my razorgrain could be put basically on top of each other making a huge spot of razorgrain, then no more could be placed anywhere even *near* that pile of razorhate.
---
If you flaunted a rare mask you wouldn't be able to play. Buddy hasnt played in 3 days because he gets bombarded with trade requests as soon as his ps4 is on.
---
dude was talking about an accessibility feature for deaf people, asshole.
---
3* fireproof perk and dense mods on armor are almost be required to offset exploding weapons.
---
I doubt you'll see many successful PA builds in survival. AP on weapons, and damage mitigating armor will be the meta.
---
Yep! My wife and I share a character, and she‚Äôs kinda new to gaming, so we haven‚Äôt actually gotten very far. But we really enjoyed the fasnacht event 
---
I wonder if they'll do a Bridge Day event this year.  The (New River) Gorge Bridge has an event every year where they shut the bridge down and people can bungee jump or parachute off of it.  It brings in tons of people.  
---
Cool wasteland idea: create a camp object that can store additional 800 pounds, but is lootable by any player. Taking it out of there where not teamed up with owner should give you bounty equal to pounds of stuff taken, and it would give an actual reason to have locked rooms in your camps on adventure servers. For survival servers this would be marvelous addition to spice up the experience.
---
These should be able to store anything, but should be mostly used for junk, as it is the only resource that can leave a chance to be regained if stolen.
---
Good even for those afraid they'd be griefed over it? Its always good to have wood and steel backup, but its not worthy to have lots of it in main stash. They could store it in lootable stash so even if stolen, not really a big loss, yet having access to abundance of em makes your building activities easier. Also looters will probably often ignore these.
---
Side effects: players now take workshops to build prize rooms and hold player-to-player events. Brand new profession of profesional thieves emerges.
---
Maybe the vault will have PvP protection like adventure mode. Like having to reach level 5 before PvP can be started. Hopefully it also has a 1 minute spawn protection too when you TP to the vault or something you own.
---
Can we please as a reddit community stop crying "TSE" ever time someone "one-shots" something with an EXPLOSIVE weapon. Its more than likely a BE (bloodied explosive) if there killing it in one shot.  / rant
---
I get one of the carnival games each day that I go over to Camden to park. So it seems to at least be sort of working for me. Then I saw someone last night wearing the Mr Fuzzy mascot suit which means that they‚Äôve been able to do enough dailies to get like 350 tokens. But as with most things in this game, it seems like your mileage may vary. 
---
That Bender mask at 2:50 was cool . Now that should of been in the event !
---
Yep... :/
---
Personally, I think Furious Gatling is very powerful with SBQ.  I use Gatling Plasma and watch it destroy SBQ's.
---
Bloodied is very good, but more difficult in a Nuke zone.
---
It's over? :'(
---
I only did the parade once and it was yesterday.
---
Skimmed right over it actually, was so thrown back it wasn‚Äôt 18 I was double checking the photo and didn‚Äôt read it a second time. Makes sense, shoulda read it more clearly  
---
The radio floating in my tent ceiling waves to you fellow camper!
---
&gt; Black powder weapons NEED to kill on the first hit otherwise they are useless
---
Switch weapons.
---
While I see your point regarding the level playing field only lasting a short amount of time, it would have been cool from the standpoint that there wouldn't be duped godtier legendaries floating around from the jump.
---
That said, I'm going to be making a new Survival only character anyways.
---
The whole thing since Wild Appalachia released has seemed like such a missed opportunity to me. I was really expecting some cool stuff with the new DLC coming out, especially with spring cleaning preceding it. We have gotten some interesting things like the horn man, mama mask, and black PA paint but I thought there would be a lot more. I just feel like they haven't been taking full advantage of the themes, like you can do a lot with "alcohol" and I don't think they did. 
---
I've had the game randomly decide for my player to hold the guns against their body.  Pointing the barrel to the left, while still holding it with both hands, rather than straight out.  Almost like the holding position when you sprint while having your gun out.  Would be nice if I could do that on command, rather than just put it away.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel it will be like. It should be easier to avoid unwanted interaction because I will no longer be visible on the map
---
Oops you did it again! Your more than welcome to join us at the murder church on Wednesday nights for our weekly meetings, we can help rid you of your demons!

In a post apocalyptic world where is everyone finding the companies to deliver industrial quantities of concrete?
---
Hey I‚Äôll take your unused stash space lolz
---
NOpe
---
also, why aren't they in paper bags?
---
how aren't they in paper bags?
---
I'm saving mine for next year if they're going to do it. Either that or just scrap them. Maybe they might have some resource that you could use. 
---
most PA paint sets only apply to T-45, T-51, T-60, and X-01 armors. Raider has no paints, Excavator only has one paint and it just cam to the atom shop recently, and Ultracite will have one soon. 
---
Most people are not aware of this.  
---
I had this on my second time for nuke was about to launch and server disconnect. I was so pissed off and also did it solo
---
I farm .308 ammo and Chems to sell at the lumber mill in the NW of the map. The Super mutants are 1 shottable with a super sledge and drop caps and .308 ammo. 
---
You probably mean Jedidiah Sawyer Aka leather face 
---
We could use a Fallout 76 request hub. Every unique suggestion gets posted one time and you upvote the things you want. Bethesda can sort by upvotes and determine what things are mostly wanted. After it's implemented that entry is deleted 
---
Not sure how hard it is to make a workshop ready version from the prop. Though, the chair is present in FO76 so there is no issue of importing the object from FO4. 
---
HEY...you not teh bozz off meeee...eye can drinks ALLLL de licker I want....AHhm snot an alk...alci.. alcoholic.....YOU ARE!

---
I seem to always find a few in the silos as well, one tone I got 5 technical data from a single run.
---
I completely agree. There needs to be ‚Äúrare‚Äù rewards in limited time events like this, but the chances of getting said rare drops needs to be slightly less hopeless. Like, it shouldn‚Äôt be a question of whether people were more likely to have seen the rare masks earned legit, or pulled from the dev room. 
---
Look out! Super Mutant suicider! They're everywhere....
---
The floors seem to get the best bang for your buck. I mean, I have one set of face paint I use, a lamp or two, but I have 20 to 30 of the different floors.
---
yes.
---
I agree.  The ONLY mask I wanted was the Owl and Old Man Winter.  I got the owl so I guess I should be happy LOL.  I missed getting the confetti and the donut recipe though.  Oh well, maybe next time they do this event they will make the drop rates better.  Heck, I would even buy it from the Atomic Shop if they would put them in there!  They could do them separately or as a pack like they did the New Year's Tuxedos etc.  I would pay massive caps for Old Man Winter! LOL.
---
That is literally your argument though.
---
 &gt; Why not stay
---
The scorched, raiders, super mutants and scorch beasts
---
Don‚Äôt forget the porn poses..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ok, but tougher to find than Fusion Cells though? :P
---
I usually go equipped with a furious gatling plasma and anti armour gatling gun on top of the .50 cal but feel the explosive 50 makes a tiny bit more of a dint.
---
And to correct, my current 50 is supressors and not troubleshooters
---
It did a few patches ago it made them slower but if you don‚Äôt notice it then it‚Äôs nothing really big
---
I rather it be like division where to can re roll a prefix.
---
here's a little Harper's Ferry hint:
---
When you spawn in, you should be right next to a huge bridge where tracks intersect. If you run straight down a hill and around/over a fallen tree, look ahead. There should be a hole in the wall.. Go around/over the cars, into the hole, through the building, and out the other side. You will be in the vendors alley. Walk straight up the dirt slope, and there he is. If you did this correctly, there won't be any enemies that attack you, and you won't have to kill any. 
---
I was thinking the same thing. They would be the perfect NPCs for Appalachia.
---
Most likely the ghouls that didn‚Äôt go feral died along with most regular humans or fled the scorched. Well, if they didn‚Äôt become scorched themselves that is.
---
Ok I figured out that the lamp will turn white and stay that way after entering the CAMP build menu, but will go back to normal after leaving and fast traveling back, or when entering the game.
---
Also, the "activate" feature doesn't seem to actually do anything and the display may not be changeable as some had suggested.
---
At least it looks nice again.
---
We need solution for PC players as well, but that's a great idea IMO
---
If you picked up more than one, I will buy one. You bet.
---
ah, yes, the good ol' "pre-war" look. I, too, would enjoy this being a thing.
---
THANKYOU SO MUCH ! Have been looking all over the place for this delightfull Little ditty n.n
---
The DMV has a robot registration terminal entry so maybe some day.
---
Tell you the best addition to my gaming experience. Headset! Can play right next to my wife while she sleeps, just cant scream when something jump scares me. Lol
---
And they are mostly duplicates of existing cards and don‚Äôt do anything, after a curtain level card packs become a nuisance.
---
We can only hope
---
I made this post more to see other people‚Äôs ideas, I still love playing the game.
---
nothing in the Atom shop effects gameplay, unless you consider "looking awesome" part of the gameplay.
---
If you still have any spare plans that's would be awesome. We we're traveling during most of the event.
---
Sounds good!
---
That is not a stupid question at all. It could help figure out more details about this very odd mystery. 
---
But longdongbong69 is an amazing user name. 
---
Sad, didn‚Äôt git any beret 
---
Fuck this post. Will someone please drop some PVP knowledge for Dorcus? Seems confused.   
---
And 'this... spoils the game' is bullshit. You had a few minutes of fighting that didn't go your way - doesn't spoil Fallout.  
---
I think that can be worked out.  Check out my post over in [/r/Market76](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b5q1c9/pc_h_surplus_fasnacht_masks_plans_recipes_w_karma/) and tell your friends.
---
From what I remember they said the event was going to go till 6 am EDT this morning.  Would have been nice if it kept going as I hadn't got that old man effigy yet:/
---
no, go away
---
This is part of the reason I don‚Äôt mind a team request from seemingly out of nowhere. I figure they are just trying to anchor themselves or maybe get a free fast travel. 
---
It would be pretty cool if following limited time events like this the hosting town sees a permanent change. Like a little homage to the event 
---
I had a guy kill me and three other people right after the parade. I was in my pipboy and he three shots me before I can get out. Wouldn't have mattered anyways because I always have pacifist mode on. 
---
John Bosley
---
I've never been addicted to anything in the game until the brewing update came out, and all those drinking challenges got me addicted. 
---
bunker/glitch bases will make the longest survivors
---
Is there a way to have the blueprint snap to a fixed point in the environment that never changes? Like also blueprinting a resource deposit miner and basing all the other structures off it's position?
---
you're the asshole in that scenario
---
Someone nuked battlefield cemetery last weekend. Flora for days up there.
---
I remember them being pretty buggy
---
YES! LET US TURN OFF THAT GODDAMN TRADE/INVITE DIALOGUE
---
Yeah.  Fuck those guys.
---
I wish they‚Äôd use Mr. Prize bot to return items that a player ‚Äúforgot‚Äù, like if they got disconnected from the SBQ fight right after she was killed. Give the player the loot they would have gotten so that being DC‚Äôd isn‚Äôt so blood boiling. It would be kind of like how in WoW when you don‚Äôt pick up items they appear in your mailbox instead. Obviously we don‚Äôt have a mailbox system yet...but they could implement an adorable fleet of robot postmen or something if they didn‚Äôt want to use Mr. Prize bot. 
---
After level 50, you can move one point at a time.
---
Did you report him in game?  You should.  That's harassment!
---
You just hold down square on ps4 and your weapon gets holstered.
---
just because counters exist doesn't mean it's in balance
---
I mean, if the workshop costs 100 to claim but the guy is level 52, it's not worth the bother to claim it.
---
Agreed!   The best part was designing an event that brought people together‚Äîregardless of level.  Very clever content design, Bethesda.  
---
I rp as a power armor mechanic and vendor. Most recently though I‚Äôve taken some time away from the shop to march in a local parade
---
maybe we will see, I did read on the news letter that everytime you fast traves you will have a time period were you are safe, but shooting or hitting someone will automatically take you out from the "safe state"
---
Nearing 7000 Atoms still can‚Äôt decide what to buy. My CAMP is basic, my attire is conservative, never interact with other players and hate posing, have a default icon.
---
Possibly como for my PA but can‚Äôt pull the trigger üòï
---
But I won't be playing in survival mode.
---
Leave my ass alone please.
---
Good let this game get review bombed to hell. It deserves every single piece of backlash it gets thrown at it. 
---
Yup, on PC. We all ran around every house and around the perimeter. Nada. Then we saw the event failed message. 
---
Fortunately, I found one last event before calling it a night. No legendary off of the sloth and no quest rewards appeared. However, I saw a bag on the ground and a kind soul had dropped my elusive donut recipe. I went to bed a happy man. 
---
Bethesda mentioned interest in cross play during development, but Sony didn't want it. Bethesda decided to proceed with development without focusing on cross play. near launch, Sony made headlines for allowing cross play with Fortnite. those headlines sparked chatter, and a lot of people were thinking that this was it, the flood gates are opening, and upcoming games like 76 will be cross play. after being brought up like crazy, Howard/Hines (don't remember who, maybe both) finally commented on it, explaining the back and forth with Sony mentioned above. I believe the last thing that was said about it was that they are open to it in the future, but it is not something that they are actively pursuing at this time. 
---
Theresa?  That  you?  I thought you were supposed to be in Parliament.
---
Oh my, I never knew how much I wanted that. 
---
I want a couple more radios. We have Appalachian and classical, I want Fasnacht and The Nukashine music. 
---
Im tanky. Ill be fine. Ill run for cover trying to talk to my aggressor. I can always kill them. But theres no fun in that.
---
Gonna try to talk to people first. I got the good gear. I run with a pack. Ill be ok.
---
The Enclave is gonna have to detain you for the transgression you committed during you blackout. 
---
Yeah the way I noticed the animation was just walking into a door, would be very nice to have that animation there
---
Final thoughts:  after trying almost everything, I think it‚Äôs safe to say the RNG was the only mistress.  I did notice a mechanics holotape saying the Fasnacht robots can party whenever they want to.  Perhaps that was the canon way of explaining why there was a parade every hour, but it could also mean that perhaps Fasnacht day will convert to a daily for extra chances at those rare masks.  We‚Äôll see I‚Äôm sure.
---
Got mine free from treasure maps. RIP 9k caps.
---
Well what if you started to play 3 weeks from now? It would be the same as now.  People that play a lot will have an advantage no matter if you start from level 1 or not 
---
M249 requires a very advanced manufacturing process. If you hand-made AK-47 from some scrap metals and woods lying around, I'm sure it weigh more than the modern very advanced light-machine gun.
---
It needs to be directional as well.
---
&gt; Felt like a beer only satiated the beast for a minute or so.
---
My only issues are that the duration is extremely short and that there aren't similar 'effects' for non-nukashine beverages.
---
I'd really like it if chems and booze had some sort of visual and auditory change. In FO4 when your character was wasted you could hear it in the dialogue, but with 76 there really isn't much other than the charisma/strength boosts that make it worth it.
---
Did they take his idea or his mod? Because one is legal and the other could bring a lawsuit.
---
What exactly do you want us to do about it?
---
Ive been doing things like that since day 1.  Gimme x or i smash your decon shower.. Dressed as a raider.
---
Then i drop some clues for some other roleplay stuff. Send players on a quest to get their shit back.
---
Imagine, day z, except you don't drop your armor or weapons and there are quests and challenges to complete and you can use stealth boys or chameleon mutation or chameleon 1* legendary items to stay invisible and avoid everyone or install a stealth boy in your power armor torso.  Anyway no I don't think so.  Sure you'll die now and then but it's not battle Royale with a constant shrinking map.  Also 20% exp buff at all times.   ALSO MOST IMPORTANT IS THEY ANNOUNCED MAKING IT HARDER TO BE ONE SHOT BY ANOTHER DWELLER BUT EVERYONE KEEPS IGNORING THAT PART OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR SOME REASON AND I FEEL LIKE IM IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.   Lol
---
Kent Connelly
---
Nah, if Theresa was playing FO76 then Brexit wouldn't be going so badly.  Maybe she got banned for duping?
---
Ok I'll bite. What mod of his did they put in?
---
Buy weapon skins first.  They make it so you can‚Äôt accidentally drop or trade the item.  
---
This is the right answer, and one of the sadder stories of the Appalachian Wasteland.
---
Much better than the Brotherhood, Enclave, Slavers and most humans ACTIVELY seeking and killing non-ferals. If you lived in a Fallout world compared to D.C., West Virginia is a vacation front. Let's not forget the active all out war between factions you don't have to be in the middle of in the Appalachian mountains. 
---
I was doing your mom
---
Bullshit
---
what mod and how did they steal it? details man, you dont even give links.
---
Amen, it's time players educated themselves! 
---
Alright, which mod was allegedly stolen
---
There is one paint leaked for ultracite. It's not out yet. Looks funky. 
---
I do that when i pass through the Flat, good stuff.
---
Yes, Currently undergoing maintenance right now to bring the new updates.
---
i use the Heart/Love to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù
---
Omg you're such an intellectual
---
Go look at his acount he uploaded a message explaining it
---
Let's get it boys!
---
I first heard of the Insult Bot a while ago and I think it's a hilarious addition to the game. How do I find it?
---
I'd certainly claim more often if I didn't have to build every time.
---
Of you are looking for raw power, not the windmill asthetic, make sure you   
---
 talk with Graham when you see him.
---
I know he carries the fusion generator plan at a reasonable price.
---
Not sure if he also has the windmill plan.
---
The server is down now to add it in, check back in about 3 hours give or take.
---
Then you havent looked very hard haha.
---
Yea it drops today servers just went down for maintenance but no patch notes yet
---
look up the 900+ hour guy. Bethesda has been missing when they swing their ban hammer.
---
Agree hopefully the move will eventually mean Bethesda have a true pacifist mode for those not wanting to PvP, where you and your base cannot be damaged at all unless you engage
---
The magic is happening right now.
---
Misspelled words and all caps show that you're super serious. 
---
296 according to the guide!
---
I'm looking forward to them. Just disappointed you can freely migrate between survival and adventure. Feels a bit like it defeats the purpose of survival :-\\
---
Yeah I have a headset but the idea was for those that can‚Äôt hear. 
---
A few other perks could use this to. Like the ones that alert you of nearby bobbleheads or magazines. 
---
let's just hope that the legendary ones do not ruin the pvp experience again

I have a feeling there might be even more people next year including myself hopefully. Do you happen to know if any of the places around there have any vegan food? I know it's probably a long shot but I'm always hopeful 
---
Hey remember that thing where this game got absurdly bad reviews then you played the first 4 hours and said 'I don't get why this got bad reviews",  the way the quest line falls off a cliff is a big part of that. Saying "oh wow, these quests aren't terrible and look at all the side quests!" early on then having it slowly sink in that is the entire game and you are already a third of the way through all the content that exists sours a lot of people on this game.  
---
i‚Äôll trade u my Beret for the Effigy but i can‚Äôt be on until about 8pm EST. if yr interested plz lmk
---
I want a survival mode at lvl 1 for all.  No trading/dropping to eliminate the external market. I'm in for that. 
---
Oohh. I do remember it saying that when I bought now. Crapü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Well, thanks
---
Suck my fuckin dick stoopid 
---
&gt; Also, I didn't insult you. I really wasn't sure you understood what I was suggesting. So I explained further. You just took it as an insult to your intelegence so you resorted to name-calling. If I did insullt you, I'd like to see where that took place.
---
What you did is patronize me, whether you intended it to be insulting or not, the way you phrased it was directly insulting. Just because you're not smart enough to realize that doesn't change the fact.
---
Thank you for the compliment.
---
I am going to give them away to people who missed the event (travel, illness, whatever) 
---
Definitely gonna check it out. Probably gonna spend most of my time in adventure mode but it will be a nice change of pace.
---
I tried it before and it didn‚Äôt work for me. I tried blueprinting a building that was next to a resource collector and it didn‚Äôt work so well. It might work for you I don‚Äôt know 
---
Think I‚Äôll probably make an alt to see what it‚Äôs all about before committing my main, in a slightly overcast east Anglia lol.
---
Let's hope!
---
Yeah, I've thought this myself. 
---
Yeah I'll be dropping these as well, after I drop off 99% of my Aid items to a mule.
---
Probably works like the Justice league. no real "leader", more of a council. 
---
But we dont get to read the comics so we may never know...
---
What fo you want in exchange?
---
Hmmm...is it likely to come soon do you think?
---
Robotics plus and sorry I'm new to reddit
---
lol, did they say how long its down for?
---
Hi, im glad to see Papertattoo can help, if he is unable to for any reason, I'd be glad to do it for free as well, im on Ps4 too PSN id FritoZ
---
ill be on tonight after work around 6 pm central time
---
:)
---
I will don my Excavator armor and just sit on a roof.
---
hai I would like to trade fasnacht plans
---
want: confetti pile plan
---
I will give you two frsnacht plans for it or one howl mask
---
have: howl mask,fasnacht baloons, fasnacht branch garland, fasnacht flag pole, fasnacht hanging snowflakes, fasnacht helveta garland, fasnacht mounted flag end fasnacht pole lentern.
---
So do you literally lose everything on you even your outfit if you die?? If so... hells no am I trying it! Not because I doubt my ability, more because if I get hit with a lag spike (which let's face it is a regular occurence) and get killed and lose everything, my controller will be going through my TV....
---
all of this (and more too)!!!!!!! I love this game so much. I miss playing it so badly but every time I'd try to do anything recently I'd just get so frustrated I'd log out. I started playing in beta and fell in love.
---
the building system is a hot mess and really could be streamlined and fixed to actually make more sense and function better. I thought a tagline for the game was "rebuild America" and I'm left wanting ...
---
I got all the common masks, the beret, and most of the CAMP plans.  I am pretty happy doing it casually.  Got some fun pictures.  It worked for me as well.
---
Thanks for the "did you try turning your computer off and then on again?" suggestion but I did that quest last November. Otherwise I wouldn't be asking, since that is the first thing that comes up when you google it. 
---
Also click the bell icon to get instant notification of all my Fallout 76 content!

Lol fair play mate.

I spent a week farming acid from the beeswax and now I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life. Bonus I have like 6,000 acid now. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This would have been the dream...
---
Robots are programmed though, and Grahm is just a singular friendly mutant. I do agree we need NPCs soon of some kind.
---
Ah I see. Well I didn't know it existed until just a few days ago so that was the first time I ever used it. Lol. I didn't think it was that bad though
---
Hurrah. Haha
---
Robotics plus according to his post
---
Share your secrets, I don't know what I'm doing but want to
---
It was then a couple weeks ago it exploded again with a new method. 
---
It can be a simple game setting in the menu. It wouldnt be too annoying because trades usually happen in a non-combat environment. It‚Äôs better to forget it‚Äôs ‚Äúoff‚Äù than end up somewhere forgetting it‚Äôs ‚Äúon‚Äù.
---
ok, ill bite, so where do you farm?
---
I mean your both welcome to come and chill I.ll making plenty beers for everyone üòÇ
---
So being able to hack robots using the perk card in Fallout 76?
---
They never do. Its usually 3 to 4 hours i think. Check back here around 2 or 3 and sort by new. People always post when its back online.
---
I‚Äôve got a spare giants mask that you can have on the house
---
By the way, is XO-1 better than Ultracite?
---
The plot thickens 
---
oh god no, that off key singing was so bad i turned down voices completely while at the parade
---
Bang on!
---
I knew there were more. 
---
It seems a shame that if you have a disability you‚Äôre at a disadvantage in a game. 
---
Can you link it?
---
Find good high ground spots wearing chameleon armor and snipe things from extremely long distance and chuckle as people are like wtf was that. It never gets old. 
---
Only "random" aid and junk drops. Thats all we know
---
Not sure go look at his post if you want his story
---
Craft it.  Make sure to get the Super Duper and Ammosmith perks.
---
I've always wondered why you name your character only to have your username displayed 
---
Once is enough... new content is fun, but grinding that event was brutal üò¨
---
Challenge tracking is awesome! But it would be even better to be able to track the individual sub-tasks per challenge. Right now I end up writing them down in a notepad (e.g. the take 20 pictures in this region). Without this I still end up having to sift through that insanely huge challenge menu every time.  
---
But it's definitely nice to be able to keep challenges top of mind now! I've been completing more than previously since this came out.
---
The jump button being disabled when you're looking at someone can be very annoying, but consoles only have so many button options. I just appreciate the fact they had the foresight to put a timer on the trade interaction.
---
So you keep your weapons and armor? I can deal with that I suppose.
---
Ultracite has more ballistic damage resistance than X-01, but less energy and radiation resistance. 
---
 I don't think ghouls are from FEV, they are just from good ol' radiation.
---
Ill be roleplaying in survival &amp; PvPing in adventure
---
Somebody that knows Jug‚Äôs reddit name needs to tag him. These are the answers we need
---
Whiskey's even better with a Rad Ant Lager chaser
---
This is pretty much what i'm doing, in a very overcast south east Anglia
---
No I found out because he made the message in the form of a downloadable mod on the nexus
---
Just turrets.  
---
Do you have the sausage plan?
---
Sounds fun!
---
awesome! I'm brazilian, never have been in the US and never thought about some specific place that I'd like to see, until now
---
and also? why should we constantly have to have a workaround to place items in camp? that's clearly not working as intended and super frustrating.
---
I have candles or potted plants. place on table. nope, they snap above on roof. so I have to remove roof tiles, place objects on table then place roof back but instead of storing that roof tile like I selected, instead the tile got scrapped.  that sequence of events happens multiple times per building session. 
---
don't even get me started on the plain white lights I bought with my atoms to put up as plain white lights that now project an image...
---
Might have one, i'll let you know after the maintenance.
---
Oic. Yeah think have to go with person who said the fading perk card on the screen. That would make it easier on us normal hearing folks too. I've been right on top of cap stash and still took forever to find them.
---
Let hope they fix daily and don't break anything else.
---
But who playing this game hasn't accidentally taken pot shots at both Grahm and non hostile robots? 
---
What kind of life has Bethesda forced us into? This is no way to live. My parents would be disappointed.
---
Should be extended an extra day due to being unable to get on yesterday because of the Beth.net problems, planned on fucking grinding it.
---
which perk in 76 is the "stolen" mod?
---
Wait, now i do remember. The guy was within five levels of me, so i thought i could take him. I was wrong. Whatever. Doesn't really warrant a "busted" comment when I'm not trying to hide anything, I'm just bad at remembering everything. 
---
I missed the majority of the event due to illness and was only able to do it once. So I'd like to have one of each of the masks and the camp plans/recipes. I'm on pc.
---
The weight of weapons in the game is out of whack without even basing it on reality.     
---
I carry three guns (gauss, handmade, shotgun) and ultra-light marine armor and am constantly over weight with a strength of 12.   The 'HEAVY' guns in this game are the sniper rifles which is absurd.  
---
I really do not know how some of you all do it running around so unencumbered out of power armor.
---
Vielen Dank meine Kollege
---
Lol I'm mad I didn't think of this.
---
I don't think the Brotherhood of Steel is in DC at this point in the timeline and the bulk of the Enclave were on an oil rig.
---
That and the area still being most likely hot from radiation would make it inhospitable to most humans.
---
It would be an ideal area for a non-feral ghoul
---
Maybe it's all of the extra masks people keep dropping
---
I hate to admit, but it still makes me laugh!
---
Thanks, yes there is a lot of filing cabinets there, when I started the grind I decided to avoid them as it would take a while to reach them, I've not really thought about them since, but will do some testing, If I can grab them all in one run, then transfer to a low level friend who could then split them out, it'll be worth it (not tested this, but I think its possible) 
---
I disagree.
---
Microsoft is clearly down for it. It could work like Minecraft until Sony gets their head out of their ass.
---
I plan on playing it, but I don‚Äôt plan on actually focusing on pvp a lot. If I run into someone, that‚Äôs fine, maybe we can be friends, or maybe one of us will start shooting. 
---
But the way I see it, if there are no longer any player map markers, and it‚Äôs still just 24 players per server then it should be kind of easy to avoid a lot of interactions. 
---
If anyone has an extra donut recipe on PS4, I would GREATLY appreciate it. 
---
If standing still, run away. If always sprinting cryo it. You can even shoot your own grenades in VATS. EZ counter.
---
Lol
---
um.... do you want to look in my inventory?   
---
why would i be asking for them if i already had them?
---
ugh some people lol
---
Most everyone has. I was just trying to throw logic at Bethesda rather than looking into plotholes.
---
or they could put some of the "rare" ones in the atom shop.  
---
You know people would buy them...
---
Hardly seems innovative vs being obvious.
---
Hehe, it's a challenge from Bethesda after all lol
---
Yeah hoping for some patch notes soon. Trying to find them. 
---
I dont see any fallout 76 perk card allowing hacked turrets. Just the one to hack enemy robots.
---
Also, how the fuck can someone act like such a simple idea as hacking something is their intellectual property and that the devs could never have had this same simple idea all on their own...
---
you know that pop up box that pops up when you claim a workshop, it is alerting you that by claiming the workshop you are consenting to PvP
---
I don't know why you need it but go to waste dump near white spring you will find out that mutants were cut in to pieces and pack in to barrels
---
So it was a mod that expanded an existing feature of Fallout 4 to turrets.  And now this modder is mad that this existing feature of Fallout 4 is in Fallout 76?  (It's been in Fallout 76 for quite some time.  I wonder why he's mad now?)
---
Hope they make that 0.03 into a 5% or a whole number lol thanks for the mininukes and the caps ...
---
I did this close to 50 times x60 =300 caps yippie ( radtoad eggs and wolf ribs were good for selling too )
---
I think it's Emmet Mountain Disposal Site, west of West-Tek, at the bottom of the cave
---
Pretty sure I found them inside Emmett Mountain Disposal Site. I plan to use them as creepy decorations when the update comes out for that, just not grabbing them right now due to them weighing a bit too much. lol
---
He gives the caps to his second character with which he doesn‚Äôt play survival. 
---
The Mistress of Mysteries is the one true leader of The Unstoppables.
---
Fite me.
---
You‚Äôve probably been asked this sort of thing at least a half dozen times, but as natives, what do you think of the game? Both in terms of authenticity of the game locations, and the artistic liberties Bethesda took to make Wv more distinctly fallout? Etc.
---
Like the grand master wandering around wondering what happen to his marchers, and a few lonely decorations here or there.  That'd be cool
---
2 GB on PC
---
Patch notes will hit here first. 
---
[LINK](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/330837/fallout-76-maintenance-march-26-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I found some at the Emmet Mountain Disposal Site a long time ago. 
---
At the bottom of left-side tunnel when you go inside. 
---
Good for passive production of 5.56. Everything else?
---
Not so much.
---
Eh, you raise a valid point. Didn't consider the timeline. You win this round buddy.
---
Good idea. I would be satisfied with 25 or so ‚Äúlocks‚Äù for my prized possessions, but this thought adds a cool new look to your faves. 
---
Oh, I‚Äôm collecting them for my friend! He‚Äôs kinda odd, he likes super mutants. 
---
Make sure if your turrets require power that they have it, and add a spotlight to improve their ability to Target enemies. Other than that they can just be buggy sometimes
---
Uhm, that‚Äôs EXACTLY what‚Äôs awaiting you buddy... I mean been trading around plenty of assa/sent gear for a long time now. Def not gonna commit to survival, people are going to be ready AF. And they have a gigantic advantage on the players who‚Äôve geared up for pve this far. Besides that, don‚Äôt feel like dropping my 1200 pounds worth of aid section within the first 5 minutes...
---
Agreed
---
That makes sense now. They need to study the items thoroughly.
---
I don't know why they never give us patch notes earlier
---
Does the Perk allow you to hack turrets directly in Fallout 76?  Or is that just thru certain things like the Terminal Hacking in Silos?
---
once I heard this event was bugged I never even played it
---
Everything transfers between survival and adventure mode.
---
Dude, you need to chill. I wasn't patronizing you. I certainly didn't call you names. I didn't "phrase" it in any way. I corrected your math. You had a wrong equasion , so I provided the correct one. That's all I did. You're the only one here that seems to be upset. I guess you're taking it personally that no one likes your "mail system" idea. It's essentially the exact same thing. Just with a 2-3 item limit and not a weight limit. So you want it to be less? What about a 50 lbs limit to shared stash? 20 lbs? It's the same idea. Yet, you're acting very egregious about difference of ideas. 
---
A new quest called what was broken or my second favorite look who‚Äôs bugging 
---
Normal, yes, but "demand" and "annoying" are words that make you come across as a dick. 
---
Well my character names are WhoCares and blahblahblah.  :D
---
I'm going to scrap all 70+ of mine out of spite.
---
Been slowly getting better but been like it since launch. I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath. 
---
Your point is a good one tho lore wise.
---
The fact that there wasn't a second migration out of Capital City sort of means to me that we the dwellers of Vault 76 sort of failed.
---
Hmm. Interesting. I love it when someone says they proved it in another forum but never reproduce the alleged proof. We're all just supposed to take it on their word the the "fanboys" were just oppressing him.
---
PC as well, 2.01 GB.

This was in the comments and. Yeah I think it explains a lot.

Thanks.
---
A commonwealth settler. I like to find players at their camp, hang out for a bit, then decide I live there too and start complaining over mic. My back hurts, my feet hurt... everything hurts! 
---
Or they could activate the text chat feature that just sits in the game files unused..
---
Not sure if it was mentioned or not. But I don't see the one where the Lemonade stand spawns. I'm pretty sure that's considered on right?
---
This! Please, Bethesda, take my money! Just fucking take it already!
---
I'm not sure, either way this guy is being a whiny child.
---
Cloth, acid, lead, steel.  Super Duper and Ammosmith perk cards.
---
Cloth is everywhere, if you're not dropping that shit to save weight, you're doing it right.
---
Steel, everywhere again, farm a bit.  Whitespring is my 'secret' farm spot.
---
Lead, any place that has weights (there are several).  Bots in Watoga are good too if you want to farm legendaries while collecting, bonus steel and aluminum.
---
Acid can be the tricky part, if I need much I farm the Grafton monster in Charleston while looking for the vendor bot there.  But if you've been doing the parade a lot, you may be swimming in the stuff by now.
---
Cloth + acid = gunpowder for days, the rest is easy.
---
Emmet Mountain Disposal Site. Upon entering the the mine, keep going straight and take the first left. Several super mutant body parts surrounded by radiation barrels and highly irradiated "water".
---
Do you need a tse cryo to slow someone running full speed on you ? And how do you manage to kill the one in sentinel assasin ? I have a tse harpoon flechette with 500 damage per shot but i don't think i can pass through the damage reduction.
---
Yea thank god the high levels where there for that sloth.  
---
I kind of doubt that. But I'm sure you will tell me I'm wrong.
---
Something new will come along and change your mind. 
---
Although I think it's cool having a Mole Miner as a legendary vendor I just think they missed an opportunity by making that one a grumpy non-feral ghoul. I just assumed the Mole Miners were limited in intelligence like the Ghost People in NV. 
---
what? that's not what happened at all.
---
Bethesda approached Sony during development. they were not interested, so they decided not to focus on cross play and continue development. near launch, Sony struck a deal to let Fortnite be cross-playable. this stirred the pot and got people thinking that all of a sudden they would be open to all games being crossplay-compatible - even though Sony was not confirming anything. Howard broke the silence and said that at one point it was something that they were interested in, but Sony's reluctance encouraged them to shift focus to other aspects of the game's development. they went on to say that while they may have an interest in the future, nothing had been done to work towards it at the time and they had other things to focus on as launch approached.
---
Do you blueprint all buildings or individual buildings??
---
BE is always the top damage, but if you dont want a bloodied build, AAE, TSE, FE is good choice too in that order.
---
I need a‚ÄùLOOKOUT BEHIND YOU!‚Äù emote because not many people use mics I noticed
---
3.487 GB
---
I apologize, my telepathic abilities are a little rusty. I clearly should have known that you had already done this quest. 
---
I've not had many problems with other players (knock on wood) but I've had this exact same thing happen with hostile NPC's (mutants, liberators, etc).  This has been a problem since beta.  Another shining example  of how Bethesda has been ignoring things that are broken and fixing things that are not. 
---
Uh.  That‚Äôs a bit extreme.  But it does suck.  Just constantly crouch and check the map every thirty seconds.  The way pvp was intended!!
---
This is about as much as I could find. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Snallygaster
---
My powered turrets have steady supply of power from 2 redundant lines and the one that was destroyed was powered once I repaired it. 
---
I‚Äôll try the spotlight...didn‚Äôt think about that. Thanks for the suggestion. 
---
OMG, I've been saying that about that one day poll. That it's flawed, even just at the most basic level. 
---
No mining helmet.
---
Thank you for in depth describing where it was!
---
Explosive was honestly OP and it was almost mandatory. The SBQ was dying under 2 mins and that's a pretty lame boss end game battle. 
---
My problem with the nerf is they nerfed it too hard and they also didn't balance any of the other weapons or modifiers to make other builds viable. The perk card is worthless now beyond a point if that. They also didn't reset our points to make it easy for us to re-balance. 
---
Happens all the time. Not everyone gets the same bugs.
---
Biv may be the happiest entity in Appalachia.  I have to believe when the BoS returned in 2255 they found Biv happily boozing it up and decided to leave him be.
---
Wtf seriously? The update is finally downloading but it better be worth deleting 2 games 
---
Read his post on the nexus for the full story
---
A have a bud of mines that says that the engine is an ecosystem that will provide what you need ( ex use 10 mm weapon get 10 mm ammo) and so on 
---
You confirm my fear, i had fun playing in pa but that's apparently not how you will win the duel in survival, guess i'm gonna stick to adventure until they put a pvp mod when you won't have any legendarys to help you, only vanilla gun and mutations to help you
---
pfft!
---
Excited for all of the new Wild Appalachia stuff to come! 
---
For now though, it's bug list time!
---

***Bugs***
---
* As of 3/13 Patch, can no longer 'inspect' items in the vendor trade menu, this makes it difficult to tell what legendary effects a 2-3 star item has
---
* As of 3/13 Patch, legendary robots and sentry bots will instantly explode when killed, rather than after a brief delay
---
* As of 3/13 Patch, events on the map can be displaced relative to their actual location (for example, a defend event for Monongah Power Plant appeared on top of Helvetia) 
---
* If you track the 'Destroy 1100 Robots with X weapon' challenges, killing a robot will display the message with the [4th digit cut off](https://imgur.com/a/uCs4XUt), like "540/110" instead of "540/1100"
---
* There are [Liberators in the sky](https://imgur.com/a/q8PAd2C) at Tygart Water Treatment
---
* If a book (**not** a magazine) spawns in the Big Al's Tattoo Parlor magazine rack, it [cannot be reached](https://imgur.com/a/mYkvQ1Q) due to the collision of the magazine rack
---
* Brewing Station - The bottle used in the animation for this station moves/shakes through the air beneath the player, even during parts of the animation that the object isn't in use
---
* The Legendary Megasloth at the end of the Fasnacht Day event sometimes doesn't ragdoll, making it unable to be looted unless it is dismemebered or becomes a meatpile
---
* Greek Letters Set - Pi and Omicron seem to have incorrect positions, they will be displaced very far to the left/right of your cursor and, once placed, cannot be selected by directly looking at them, you must look at them from the side to select them correctly
---
* Technical data can show up among alcohol as an item option to place in a fermenter, trying to do so does nothing
---
* Cryolator and Flamer do not benefit from any kind of damage boost that increases energy weapon damage (such as High Voltage Hefe or Energy Weapons Bobbleheads), despite both being energy weapons
---
* Ballistic Bock does not increase ballistic Heavy Weapon damage, such as .50cal Machine Gun, Minigun or LMG
---
* The daily repeatable quest, Wasted on X (the new brewing dailies), does not remove the specified type of alcohol from your inventory when you turn it in to Biv, despite him (presumably) drinking it
---
* Event - Powering Up Thunder Mountain - The description lists "Thunder Mountain Power Plant has failed. Repair its systems and get the power back"; it cuts off the last part of the sentence, 'on.', that is seen in the other power plant descriptions
---
* Quest - Forbidden Knowledge - The quest objective is spelled incorrectly, 'techncial' should be 'technical'
---
* With the flechette mod on a Harpoon Gun, you can yield more harpoons than you expended on an enemy because each of the 7 projectiles can individually proc a 'recovered' harpoon, yielding between 0 and 7 harpoons for every 1 harpoon fired
---
* Your addictions can randomly disappear over time, unclear what causes this
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Make big masks into "outfits" for power armor helmets (so you can wear both at the same time), would make the Vaultboy/girl heads and Fasnacht masks have fun application in power armor
---
* Would love timers for items on your debuff bar so that you don't need to open pipboy to check things like disease duration, Rad-X duration, chem/booze duration
---
* Challenge tracking needs a different sound, it is hard to tell when you have completed a challenge due to the 2 sounds being very similar
---
* Challenge tracking needs to process faster if there are multiple stacked notifications, or only display the most recent iteration of each challenge, otherwise there is a very long backlog to go through (Super Duper procs also have this problem)
---
* Let us build the Nuka Cherry Lamp and Speakeasy Nuka Cola Door in our camps!
---
* Give us a way to play Big Al's Tattoo Parlor music in our camps
---
* A marker/rug we can build in CAMPs for our tamed pets to stand on/near 
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* The mixed drink versions of alcohol seem pointless; you use the best version of a drink to create an inferior version. Would make more sense if they were simply lower resource versions, but currently you just intentionally create a worse item
---
* Increase brahmin spawn rate, they are very uncommon outside of Flatwoods
---
* Ability to dismiss tamed animals, please my sloth won't stop roaring I can't take it anymore
---
* Percepti-bobble perk for plans and recipes
---
Wow. Thanks. Nice to see its an actual real life event. Also if u notice they got the town right too buildings etc
---
Nice! I stopped playing 76 a while ago but this is gonna get me to jump back in, should be more intense :) 
---
Just buy a dupe for caps. Bethesda is perfectly fine with you having one of each.
---
Tbf she seems to be the smartest one, sadly we dont know enough about the Illusionist to confirm for sure.
---
Not even gonna mention Manta Man
---
Until the patch today at least. 
---
Oh that would be great.  Just make him every so often turn into the cult leader and start chanting burn him burn him.  Best part of the event was him going from cheerleader into cult leader.
---
Ricky bobby
---
When the scorchbeasts and Enclave are debating who's more evil...
---
I think not having a bunch of non-feral ghouls roaming around with West Virginian accents was a huge disservice to us Fallout fans.
---
Read the new Patch notes.
---
Basically.  I guess he thinks he deserves credit for the idea.  He apparently didn't read the EULA.  
---
That depends why you left
---
I think you mean ‚Äúpromote you‚Äù
---
I've been having the wall spawn issue constantly since the last patch. Not just my own camp, either. Quickest escape I've found without having to fast travel is to just build a chair in front of yourself and sit in it, you'll be free again after you stand up. 
---
Found the mod in question [here](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4057169) . I have no experience with it personally, though I am fairly familiar with the modding scene.
---
That being said, this isn't a new idea or unique to this modder. I distinctly remember [this mod from two years prior](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19575) and I can't recall which but I know there was also a version of this back in FO3. 
---
We know that.
---
The issue is that the PVP extends beyond the workshop.
---
Because of this, people are initializing PVP, not to take the workshop, but to simply kill a player.
---
Players have been starting the process then either travel across the map to continously kill the owner or send friends to do it.
---
And since killing the workshop owner isn't what ends the PVP portion, instead it only ends when the workshop is fully taken, the person can continuously follow and kill that other player with zero repercussions.
---
The workshop owner is then forced to log off or server hop to end the process.
---
***THAT"S*** what we are saying is broken with workshpop PVP.  
---
If the PVP/contesting portion ended when the instigator left the build area of the workshop -**OR**- if the owners could have the option to abandon the workshop when the conesting started, then there would not be an issue.
---
The way the mechanic is now just allows the people that want to be assholes to be assholes.
---
Since the servers are offline right now the answer is: Maybe but definitely not yet.
---
Maybe in the next tnt dome
---
They already said it's in the works. 
---
You have been marked
---
There are a few caves I know of you can build in
---
Not sure why I'm being down voted lmao but no problem, good luck man I've heard they help a lot.
---
It is very very sad, that people in here not even try to look at the details and directly jump on conclusions, calling the modder a liar and downvote OP to oblivion. How in the hell can you take the word of a multi million dollar company as granted, and ignore the word of a fellow community member who spent years of providing free content for various games, calling him a liar and not even listening to his story? This is the prime example of a community, consisting of mindless fanboys who are not able to think just for one second and consider anything that sheds a negative light on their favorite developer as a blatant lie and untrue. You people are everything that‚Äôs wrong with gaming and you should be ashamed of yourself. 
---
He's a whiny child
---
"Here we go!"
---
Well probably less then you are used of, and probably none if the person is wearing assasins sentinel armor XD.  Prepare for a 30min battle with another player XD
---
All ive done for the past month is build at the airport. I never save my structure as i enjoy redoing it each time to give me a chance at a unique design thought. Though staying on a server very long in one place at a workshop with a large structure has increased my interaction griefing by leaps and bounds.  Usually they try to insult the hell out of me. But frankly it costs me next to nothing to build aside from 1/2 5 minue wood trips. Also it gives 1 or 2 less assholes to deal with when i actually don't want to be attacked and the ability to start over again on the next server.
---
Yes, this has been my point most of the time, I actually dislike pvp most of the time (unless people steal), but this would be my go to if passive mode wasn‚Äôt being fixed.
---
Holy shit man. Your base is freaking fantastic. Majestic. Really and truly. 
---
i can see people making minimalist camps to reduce destruction
---
&gt;As of 3/13 Patch, can no longer 'inspect' items in the vendor trade menu, this makes it difficult to tell what legendary effects a 2-3 star item has
---
this needs to be fixed. along with adding inspect to player trading.
---
This is amazing information.  Donyou happen to have the lists for each type of event?  We can compare the encounters in each location to the lists in order to determine the options available for each location.
---
My blueprints consist of two variations of "Turret Box" which is just a foundation, four walls, a roof and four turrets.  Just a quick throwdown for some extra firepower for the defense mission.  But what you're saying sounds like more fun.
---
Although i am not much of a pvp player i will defintly try out this survival mode
---
No more ability to one shot in PvP? That‚Äôs going to be a decision everyone is totally cool with and won‚Äôt make anyone rage quit or asshat gloat. 
---
I think I'm going to destruct and store my base parts before I enter survival. I have an immobile, specialized house built around a tree and geographic features, that I don't want blown up.
---
So the ability to hack turrets with the robotics expert mod.  They didn't take his mod.  It's possible they got the idea from his mod, but no it really provable, and they don't owe him some sort of credit anyway based on the EULA.  Sounds like he needs to grow up.   
---
no, yes, avoid, avoid, avoid, safety in numbers, no, unique items, no, no, HELL no
---
Great idea. I don‚Äôt use photo mode capture because I can‚Äôt save them but if we can upload from Xbox capture that would be awesome. 
---
When they have the cryo effect, thier APs are depleted and they cannot regain AP for the next 10 seconds. That means no more sprinting, so no more Cavalier effect (and no VATS btw). Plus no more Dodgy Perk (AGI) effect.
---
For those in Sentinel, shoot 'em while they move, or flee (so they can't kill you either).
---
And the explosive effect is s*** for PvP now, with Dense mod and Fireproof perk. Don't use it.
---
You are the first positive reply I've gotten on the post.
---
Wtf I was up late as fuck building the perfect pvp build for this today and they probably just ass fucked me.... spent like 40k caps wasted level ups this shit is gay as aids
---
Yeah I would imagine there was a bug since so many people were farming it by hundreds and not getting many of the listed rewards.
---
Im assuming the Bethesda has listed the potential rewards, haven't bothered to check.
---
Kidney
---
You‚Äôre assuming that it‚Äôs ONLY  1v1 pvp. 
---
griefers run in packs. The 1 attacking you has you flanked  by  2 others, in hidden positions.
---
Nope.  You have to wait until next week when they fix bugs discovered after this week's update.  Then you have to wait another two months before they make some changes based on player feedback.  Then you have to wait another four months after that before they add some unique content that appeals to you.  Then you have to wait another two years because the rumors of Fallout 5 start to hit heavy.  Then when Fallout 5 drops, you realize that you have to buy the XBox Sierra Madre (a brand new console in 8k definition with 3D upconverting and Smell-o-vision technology) and you don't have the $15,000 to spare on it, but Fallout 76 will be on sale for $0.99 so that's when you can pick it up.
---
No they don't. It's not an exploit.
---
Here's where we diverge. 
---
In a roleplaying game, you are playing a character. If we get into "it relies on the player skills" then the character is irrelevant. 
---
No. drugs are chemical change to the way the brain works.  we're not talking smoking a joint here, we're talking about the video game equivalent of taking meth and PCP.
---
Maybe go buy a cheap harddrive? Most people have the 2 tb seagate harddrive that microsoft promotes. Me myself i run a 4 tb harddrive. Makes a huge difference in processing when you have that kind of space
---
Another pic similar to this popped up on here yesterday evening. I'm trying to find the post but failing so far.
---
That shit gives me anxiety now LOL, the grind was real! Not one rare mask to show, either :P.
---
And last weeks inside the vault
---
I would prefer to see both. Titles and ranks would also be nice. I just want people to know I'm Forest Ranger Dick Strong, or Ranger Dick, or even Dicky. 
---
I wonder if you can team up in survival mode or will it be a free for all thing
---
Suddenly those junkie weapons aren't so bad eh?
---
Not confirmed, just a theory.
---
I feel ya bro but hey screw it imma flog all my spare masks in 6months or so for a nice profit
---
Rifle builds without gun smith are kind of annoying. You cant mod or craft, and will constantly be repairing your weapons. I think 6 points between tenderizer and suppressor is a massive waste of points tbh. I also see some quality of life issues in there between not having bandolier for ammo WR and having to carry around a bunch of guns when the ones you are using are all broken with no gun smith to slow their degradation. 
---
I think this nets you more damage AND a bit better QoL. 
---

---
These are pretty underwhelming. Are we ever going to see any QOL updates like inventory filters, save item from being sold/dropped/destructed, having the option to make meat piles and your bag glow so you can more easily find dropped loot?
---
It's cheap enough to repair.  Just don't have a rads shower and your golden.  Put your house on a junk extractor for odds and ends and scrap a hand full of guns for steel.   Early on it might be a pain but I've repaired my entire base a few times now (players and scorchbeast) and im always suprised by how cheap it is.
---
So, she says everyone wears their mask in the parade.  Takes their mask of for the dance.  Then they burn old man winter.  Hmmmm....
---
My thought exactly.
---
Yeah, I know you crafted a new gun, I was just confused as to why my pipe rifles still came up as level 1 when crafted. Been using a level 10 pipe bolt action rifle.
---
Very kind, but I'm on PS4 and I'm actually not doing too badly with the crappy, non-legendary variety. Well... I don't feel like I'm slogging through mud and broken glass like I used to with them anyway! xD
---
That is frustrating. I'd have stayed up a little later last night if I'd known. Oh well.. wouldn't have gotten my dream mask anyway :P
---
Dude, stop trying to draw attention to your person through reddit. If your story once became popular, thanks to not very smart journalists, this does not mean that you are now a VIP and everyone should do what you want. 
---
Do you have problems with the ban? Do you think you got a ban undeservedly? **Write to technical support**. Enough to produce threads on reddit with your shit. 
---
That‚Äôs survival Beta, right? Still WIP as soon as it‚Äôs deployed.
---
Hopefully it gets griefers off pve servers so that I‚Äôm no longer prematurely blocking random folks.
---
A few successful runs with no mask, a bunch of glitched sloths, and only Owl, Toothy, or Soldier when I did get the drop.  Oh and a beret.
---
Main thing for me is I will no longer be relying on Thru Hiker to keep all my chems in my inventory :D  I don't want to lose like 200 stim packs just because someone got the jump on me.  
---
Other than the fact Graham walks around muttering to himself about whether or not this is real, and if he's imagining or living it
---
Or about the fact "this isn't real" is found all over the game, moreso in the school
---
Think of it this way:
---
It's a simulation to see what America's best and brightest would do if given complete and fill access to nuclear key codes and such. 
---
1) We never ever ever see our overseer.
---
2) She "happens" to leave a trail of tapes and supplies leading us from V76 all the way to the nuke silo itself
---
3) Her computer in V76 states that it is her job to make sure the silos stay out of the control of everyone EXCEPT vault tec staff/residents - who have been given full access
---
4) Your pipboy time always resets to the exact start of reclamation day upon re-entering the game
---
5) the purple "matrix" texture that's been found several places
---
6) "Secretary Thomas Eckhart, per an Enclave Whitespring Bunker Archival Terminal Entry, is told that we are in a VSS Simulation (Post-Chinese Nuclear War), and that we can only escape by destroying the location that is the conduit to the outside (a small town in China)."
---
Guess i'll die, i had a collection of tse heavy gun, putted 30 level to respec strenght, i don't think i can compete in a PA with normal guns now even if my aim is good
---
I like the booze challenges.
---
Please also add chem challenges :D, and need more Breaking Bad clothes and CAMP items. Can we get a trailer?
---
Grow the fuck up. 
---
I got that mentality also haha :) I been playing F4 for the first time instead now and having a blast, but I am picking up EVERYTHING :)
---
Ya good idea
---
If you are suggesting that the intending gameplay mechanic is to team up and have one person follow the camp owning person to some spot across the map while being immune to damage from them, then signal your teammate once you have the VATS headshot lined up.... then you are na√Øve.
---
Slightly better at building vats crits / ap. Pistols are in a bad spot tbh.
---
I can see a lot of people not playing this mode out of sheer annoyance. No one can carry junk and what aid you have will randomly be dropped of you are killed. On top of that your base is subject to demolition if anyone finds it. Im annoyed just reading the patch notes
---
I seriously don't understand all this wanting clean weapons and clothes lark.
---
It's not pre war it's a post war landscape, things have been lying there for 25yrs+ so obviously they are going to look f#$ked. There is no factory churning out clean new items or pieces, so any item/weapon will have to be made with already existing pieces from before the war in their construction.
---
Beth takes a 50% cut of all bounties claimed, and the all the caps you get from a bounty kill, not their level # as in nominal PVP
---
M16A2 w/ 203, 6 M67 grenades, 300 rounds 5.56, 12 40mm rounds, bayonet, my entrenching tool and all the other shit we humped in Desert Storm; still less encumbered than my FO76 character that's wearing leather armor, carrying some food , 2 weapons with ammo and a bag of junk...
---
Probably not much will follow and I‚Äòm ready to take the downvotes. But It‚Äôs just not ok how the community reacts to this case. 
---
Yay!
---
Guess we'll know when it comes online. Can't wait tbh, if done right this could bring a lot more skill required in pvp, that one shot shit has been old since beta.
---
Do you like PvP?
---
I hear ya, it seems not too many people even noticed the end time when they announced the event. And I'm right there with ya on the masks at least I got my cool beret.
---
Damm that rebalancing on pvp dmg sounds interesting, we are going to need to do a lot of testing n stuff...
---
And should be able to change our character name only once since it doesn't currently use our character name
---
&gt;  Just don't have a rads shower and your golden.
---
Why can't I have my golden?  :'-(
---
You cant drop anything like this. It would just be a paper bag
---
If it was a fresh character I was be extra precautions. Since there's unlimited character migration between survival and adventure I don't really see a reason for its existence other than deathmatch.
---
ha!!! its like the "evil" spock from star trek TOS
---
It‚Äôs just adding the survival mode yeah? They are removing slap damage in adventure mode so yay?
---
Try to get something heavy with AA and you should be fine.
---
Fallout BR
---
Maybe they're all in one of the locked vaults? Very doubtfull but maybe.
---
 Todd said that every human in this game is another player, never said anything about ghouls....
---
weapons and armor drop off bodies sometimes. You can actually see them laying around. Like  [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/1QEJsml). A lot of the times the just return to the body/inventory. 
---
do we know how long it'll be down for? the download finished super quick for me. how long til i can playyyyyy
---
This entire patch was always told to be an e
---
Make them dirty or different, too. I just want skins to lock down my inventory 
---
Aside from the top leaderboard people being displayed on the map, this looks pretty wild.
---
Playing survival mode entirely and yes to almost everything. Risking it at nuke sites, actively searching and enaging in PvP with my fiance and our friends. We are really looking for another unfair survival game like Ark so this is great
---
New ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù Options
---
¬†The standard Fallout 76 experience has been renamed ‚ÄúAdventure‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSurvival Beta‚Äù has been added as a new game mode.
---
Upon selecting ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù from the Main Menu, players can now choose whether to join an Adventure Mode world, or a Survival Mode Beta world.
---
New characters can enter Survival Mode Beta worlds immediately after leaving Vault 76 in an Adventure Mode world.
---
Existing characters can freely switch back and forth between Adventure and Survival mode.
---
All progress‚Äîincluding quests, levels, perks, inventory, and so on‚Äîtravels with characters when switching between Adventure and Survival. Anything that affects a character in one mode is also reflected in the other.
---
Survival-specific Challenges and Scoreboard stats will only be updated while in a Survival world. Find additional details about Scoreboards and Survival Challenges further below.
---
Adventure Mode
---
While the standard play experience has a new name, Adventure Mode is still largely Fallout 76 as you know it today. However, today‚Äôs patch does bring a significant change that should greatly reduce the effects of unwanted PVP on your Adventure Mode characters:
---
‚ÄúSlap‚Äù Damage Has Been Removed from Adventure Mode
---
All incoming damage from players you are not hostile with (A.K.A. ‚Äúslap‚Äù damage) will now be automatically reduced to zero, effectively removing slap damage from Adventure Mode.
---
Returning fire against another player will still mark you as hostile toward them and will cause you to take full damage from their attacks.
---
Contesting an owned Workshop is still considered a hostile action. If a player attempts to contest a Workshop you own, or you attempt to contest another player‚Äôs Workshop, you will be open to taking full damage from their attacks.
---
Weapon damage during PVP combat has received overarching adjustments to help a wide variety of weapons feel more deadly versus other players.
---
This also limits the amount of health players can lose in a single hit during PVP combat, which will greatly reduce the likelihood of one-shot kills.
---
These adjustments have been applied to PVP Combat in Survival Mode, as well.
---
The period of invulnerability that‚Äôs briefly applied to characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning has been increased.
---
Firing a weapon before this time expires will remove Invulnerability.
---
PVP Combat and Balance
---
Fast Travel and Respawn Invulnerability
---
Survival Mode (Beta)
---
Survival Mode is a more competitive and dangerous new game mode for Fallout 76, and contains a number of changes from Adventure Mode that you may want to be aware of before you dive in. However, it‚Äôs also important to note that you can still complete quests and events, level-up, loot, and explore Appalachia in Survival Mode just as you can in Adventure Mode.
---
Read on to learn about what‚Äôs new with the Survival Mode Beta, and be sure to check out¬†[our recent overview article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)¬†for even more info.
---
Players in Survival Mode are hostile toward one another by default and may be attacked without restriction.
---
Additionally, there is no slap damage in Survival Mode, and players will immediately take full damage from each other‚Äôs attacks.
---
Players can holster their weapons when approaching others to appear neutral or friendly, causing a light-yellow nameplate to appear overhead.
---
Those who approach others with weapons drawn will appear hostile and display a red marker overhead, rather than a nameplate.
---
Only the healing effects of one Stimpak of each type can be active at any given time.
---
For example, a Diluted Stimpak and a regular Stimpak can both be active at once, but multiple regular Stimpaks effects cannot.
---
The PVP Combat weapon damage adjustments mentioned in the Adventure Mode section above also apply to the Survival Mode Beta.
---
Bonus XP When Playing Survival Mode
---
All players gain a +20% bonus on any experience points they earn while playing in Survival Mode.
---
Complete New Weekly Challenges, Earn Legendary Rewards
---
New Weekly Challenges have been added which offer legendary rewards on completion.
---
A new Weekly Challenge will be added every week during and beyond the Survival Mode Beta, each featuring a different reward.
---
The first six Survival Mode Beta Weekly Challenges award legendary weapons. Learn more about them in our recent¬†[Survival Beta Overview article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)¬†on Fallout.com
---
High-Stakes Death Mechanics
---
On death, players will drop a random amount of the Aid items that were in their inventory in addition to all their Junk.
---
Cap rewards for player kills, and Cap deductions on death, have been doubled in Survival Mode.
---
The Seek Revenge respawn option has been disabled and will not appear when attempting to respawn.
---
When killed during PVP combat, players can choose to spend a portion of their Caps to place a Bounty on their killer.
---
This will mark that player as Wanted and display the Bounty amount on all other players‚Äô Maps.
---
Half of the Caps spent by the slain player will appear as the Bounty reward, and the minimum cost to place a Bounty is 200 Caps.
---
¬†Limited Fast Travel and Respawn Locations
---
Fast Travel is limited to Vault 76, the player‚Äôs C.A.M.P., Train Stations, and any Workshops that player owns.
---
Respawn is limited to Vault 76, the player‚Äôs C.A.M.P., and Train Stations.
---
The brief period of invulnerability applied to characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning in Adventure Mode also applies to characters in Survival Mode, and is also removed if the player fires a weapon before the time expires.
---
¬†Player Positions are Hidden on the Map
---
The Map will not display players‚Äô locations unless they are currently Wanted or among the top three on the Longest Life Scoreboard.
---
Climb the Scoreboards
---
Scoreboards have been implemented, which rank players in the current world across a variety of stat categories based on their performance during the current life, as well as their best life for the week.
---
These stats include: Longest Life, Player Kills, XP Gained, Events Completed, Enemies Killed, Bounty Collected, Time Wanted, and Workshops Claimed
---
Players‚Äô stats travel with them upon switching to new Survival worlds.
---
View the Scoreboards by opening the Map and pressing D-Pad Left on Consoles, or on PC by clicking the new compact Scoreboard widget on the Map.
---
The top three players on the Longest Life Scoreboard will display a Gold, Silver, or Bronze medal next to their player icons.
---
These medals also appear on the Map to highlight the top three players‚Äô current positions for all other players in that world.¬†
---
A new recap screen will display on death, allowing players to view their stats from that life and compare them to their best life of the week.
---
Social Menu Survival Icon
---
Friends who are currently in Survival Mode worlds now display a campfire icon next to their names in the Social Menu.
---
Bug Fixes
---
Art and Graphics
---
Robobrains:¬†Removed an unintended glowing visual effect from Robobrain heads.
---

---
Performance:¬†Addressed an issue that could cause a performance reduction if a player was killed while disconnecting from a world.
---
Servers:¬†Addressed multiple issues that could affect server stability.
---
Quests and Events
---
Signal Strength:¬†Addressed an issue that could cause a door switch to go missing in the National Radio Array Control Room.
---
User Interface
---
Change Appearance:¬†Appearance changes that are not accepted by the player no longer occasionally persist after exiting the Change Appearance menu.
---
Hotkeys:¬†Addressed an issue on PC causing the hotkey for the ‚ÄúToggle Premium‚Äù filter option in Workbenches to have no effect when pressed.
---
Localization:¬†Fixed an issue causing some notes, letters, and quest objectives relating to the Wasted on Nukashine questline, and the Brewing and Distilling crafting system, to appear in English while running Fallout 76 game client in languages other than English.
---
Localization:¬†Fixed an issue that could cause the text on the Nukashine bottle‚Äôs label to extend beyond the edges of the label when running Fallout 76 in languages other than English.
---
Localization:¬†The ‚ÄúToggle Unlockable‚Äù and ‚ÄúView in Atomic Shop‚Äù options while previewing unowned Atomic Shop items in a Workbench no longer display placeholder text when running Fallout 76 in languages other than English.
---
Localization:¬†The ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option that appears when viewing an item while over the absolute weight limit no longer displays placeholder text when running Fallout 76 in languages other than English.
---
its not a fat gun, its just big boned.
---
lever action is fat too
---
The seagate runs about $80 for a 2 tb harddrive but you can use other brands too. Maybe you can find a cheaper one on amazon or ebay? Its a well worth investment especially if you are a serious gamer. 
---
Thank you as always for these lists! We're tracking many of these thanks to reports from players here and on the forums, and will parse through this list to catch any that we aren't already investigating. 
---
People will find a way to still one-shot others, sadly.
---
Bethesda should gather help from experts on PvP-focused games.
---
If by capable you mean leading them to someone's camp to get their turrets to help, or jumping on a rock where they couldn't reach me and firing at their head until I run out of ammo or they die, then yes. I survived in pleasant valley by sheer luck, found a platform I could kind of hide behind for cover and peeked out to shoot the hordes of scorched until enough of them died for me to move, because some high levels came through but didn't help me at all, just killed one or two scorched and left me to die, but I got away and got the power armor nearby (but couldn't use the single leg piece of raider power armor it ofc)
---
seasonal event. it will be back next year.
---
Maybe YOU don't.

---
&gt;Weapon damage during PVP combat has received overarching adjustments to help a wide variety of weapons feel more deadly versus other players.
---
Can changes like this be a bit more descriptive (in the future)? Is is just normalizing the curve overall or making select changes to specific weapons? I feel like having to go into the game and check everything manually is not the most ideal scenario 
---
Guess you should have waited
---
Should i keep the tse for pve once the underground raids come ? Thanks for the intels btw
---
how about some statistics for mask drops during fasnacht?
---
It's ok on my side, just finished it. Maybe it's already done for you, kek.
---
One thing i don't really understand. Are those new weekly challenges for legendary weapons limited to survival mode only? Or we can complete them in adventure too?
---
Yes plz
---
*shudder*
---
Yes! You can join teams in Survival.
---
Gamma gun meta incoming. 
---
Turret hacking isn't remotely new or unique, so I'd say most people are probably going to be skeptical of this whole episode . 
---
Frankly, I've never heard of the author mentioned and I assume he doesn't go by the same tag on Nexus. 
---
so to answer LoneWolf's question, it's a situational thing really. even excavator has some perks lategame that the others don't. I keep one full suit of every armor type just in case.
---
See my comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated_map_of_random_encounter_locations/ejezijp/).
---
any idea when the prestige feature will go live?
---
When you approach a player with your weapon holstered, can they just gun you down like anyone else or will you be invulnerable from player damage until you draw your weapon?
---
I‚Äôm wondering where the haters get their hate from, especially if they haven‚Äôt bought it or played?
---
If they‚Äôre not playing the game,  what‚Äôs driving their hate?
---
Anger, frustration, competition? 
---
Still not sure it‚Äôs a good idea to allow characters to freely switch between modes. What‚Äôs stopping Mr.Badass from just stomping Nerds today?
---
Since the dawn of online gaming, you mean
---
Considering it's based off of a real life holiday, there is a very real possibility it will be an annual event. Whether items will make another appearance is up for debate, but I'd wager at least the more common ones would.
---
If someone wants to put in that amount of effort to kill someone, that's on them 
---
Well my faction sells a lot of items and we have a few PS4 players that could use company. The group name is the Apalachia trading company. If you'd like I could link you to our discord and you could look for people to trade with.
---
What's the highest level PA you can get? 
---
big guns, shotguns, explosives, melee and pistols have it. Rifles do not.
---
Group, stealth, pve while cautious of and geared for PvP lol.  20% exp buff with 15% in party too (and strength in numbers, always nice)
---
I have at least a hundred masks and at least 60 spare plans/recipes. Im going to be rolling in the caps.
---
Honestly I suck at PvP. I have a stealth pistol/grenade build and it doesn‚Äôt compare to bloodied melee or TSE shotguns/weapons. 
---
Even so, I‚Äôm interested in the survival mode. 
---
I think I‚Äôll hop on over, use my stealth so I don‚Äôt get murdered, and take a look. The added suspense seems like it would be fun, but not something I‚Äôd want to do full time. I know a lot of people are angry you can move characters back and forth, but I kind of like it. 
---
Adventure for quests, farming and building. 
---
Survival for the challenge rewards, etc. 
---
An absolute cap on pvp damage is an interesting choice, shifts the PvP meta fully to Damage Resistance and DPS instead of going for high damage to one tap
---
Plain old Milspec OD GREEN, period.
---
I have a 2tb seagate harddrive already picked out and saved on my pcpartpicker list that I was going to get for the pc I am building, so I‚Äôll just buy that now and upgrade my PS4 then I‚Äôll use it for my pc once it‚Äôs built 
---
Judging by bethesda's record, that will be much later as there are already mods that do some of those things.  
---
You have a point, if its a one time event those masks will be very rare in the future. But for me, i dont need them.  Its a cosmetic thing.  And they dont have much value to me. I never bothered doing the event.
---
This has happened to many times
---
All good, but the weekly rewards.. bunch of crap ü§£
---
I really wanna see some events away from fetch quests and follow quests. Would be nice to introduce something a bit more interactive that has the player actually interact with others. I guess that may end up being any future dungeons but still, would love some more exciting events.
---
I banked a lot myself lol.  My inventory is now full of mods and guns and my stash is full of aid items and junk lol
---
Can't believe they are allowing free and unlimited migration... Such a missed opportunity.
---
Yeah, it gets a little on the asinine side, especially when you're carting around a fucking arsenal because your weapons weigh significantly more in your stash. 
---
Make the shower
---
Store it 
---
Deploy for use
---
Store it again
---
&gt; ‚ÄúSlap‚Äù Damage Has Been Removed from Adventure Mode
---
Well that's all I care about in this update, but at least survival mode will get rid of all these annoying PvPing assholes.
---
Looking forward to better patch notes next week.
---
I think the TSE is still nice for PvE, it's a nice flat damage increase. With the good weapon perks and Tenderizer, it should wreck everything. Just pray so they don't add explosive resist to mobs in raids ;p
---
im wondering if this means sniper/rifle builds focused on 1 shots wont work in survival.
---
Ye, but if they did it separate, you could not trade between, like when there is new season in Diablo III
---
Lost track already, eh?
---
I switched to a Prime Gatling Laser out of pure cheapness. I can craft ultracite cores from my almost empty PA cores and with max intel and super-duper I get a lot of ammo. Power user doubles my shots. And you‚Äôd think it wasn‚Äôt really close to being as good as my .50 and you‚Äôd be right. 
---
I can only hope they'll be in one of those vaults. As for Todd's idea of making all humans other players with "their own stories" he is clearly out of touch and never played a multiplayer survival game. Human NPCs seem to work fine in ESO. 
---
Still waiting on the energy resistances fix to make energy weapons viable. How hard can it be? 
---
Then you lose weapons and armor 
---
Hopefully with different masks to get so this year's masks will be still valuable to sell 
---
You should probably wait until the summer when they finally release those things and that stuff they promised back then.
---
See you there üò∂
---
Thanks! That one is actually just a workshop (Berkeley Springs) This one is my CAMP, it has two extra buildings now that aren‚Äôt in the video :)

---
no way
---
So most likely, someone will send a random invite. If you team up he will know your location. He well come to you, remove you from the team and shoot you to walhalla...  
---
I wish you could have that only fast travel to train stations option in adventure mode.
---
On the contrary, they say weapons are meant to feel more powerful
---
You gotta protec your poverty!
---
That's a petty cool idea
---
Furious is fun for a non-bloodied build ;)
---
I kept some stuff from the event.  I plan to put that in my vending machine when the time comes.
---
I am skeptical that anyone got one of the rare masks from the event.  I suspect that the one's we've seen were actually acquired in the dev room a while back.  I'm not saying that definitively, but that's my hunch.  I tend to agree with that post the other day speculating that the rare "no mask drop on a successful event" glitch was actually supposed to award one of the rare ones but something is bugged.
---
If the rarity was actually working as intended, that's disappointing.  There's rare and there's basically impossible.
---
Wasn‚Äôt me downvoting, I appreciate the advice
---
I've made wall-miunted spotlights before. Even when wired, they did not activate. I hope you have better luck.
---
Also, is there any evidence that spots help turrets? In FO4 I thought they alerted settlers in your settlements. Not sure what they do here aside from aesthetics. 
---
Overall, I've given up on protecting my camp. I've even had missle turrets that did nothing. When it's trashed I just move it slightly and it repairs itself. 
---
Yeah, I have a few blueprinted structures that I take the workshops near the starter zone , do the two quests,  build up some shops for the lowbies and leave. I don't really ever return, I just let the monsters take it
---
Sometimes people take it , I get groups of people trying to bait me, which is always hilarious as I'm literally watching them run towards my workshop on the map from the gates of Vault 76   :P  
---
I mean, at least try and sneak, newbs  
---
I do this on my stealther, so i'm sneaking 98% of the time, so as far as a bounty hunter coming after me, good luck! 
---
Unlimited character migration between survival and adventure?¬†What's the point in survival then? Nobody in their right mind will level a character there. It should have been labelled death match mode as that's its only purpose under this ruleset.
---
Characters made in survival mode should be bound to it.
---
Not only that but now the broken market of adventure mode will flood survival mode. Months of duping and unbalanced game play could have been wiped clean.
---
Such a missed opportunity!¬†They could have let players bring over their character progression but that's it. They could have introduced new measures to stop bought TSE weapons getting brought in as well by making legendaries not available for trade and when dropped only appearing to the owner. Whyyy Bethesda why!¬†This could have been so good and a great new fresh start.
---
Perks will stay the way they are now.
---
Probably will dump excess sooner or later, but the truth is I already store most aid on my alt. Level 3 with 1100 used cary weight :)
---
I'll play normally hoping to be shot, or dance with people I am sure want to dance. Probably lots of organised PvP too.
---
With the nuke it depends. If they added new nukable cool stuffs then definitely I'd go there.
---
I will be actively seeking willing opponents, I wont be camping vendor doors.
---
I play with group and I actively make connections with other group so we could have organised PvP.
---
I want to play a game that forces you to think how not to die. To think if its better to handle this situation quick and loud, or to use more silent approach and not lure players hearing gunshots from several hundred meters.
---
I favor the theory the game is pretty balanced but you gotta team up as there is no all-purpose build that dominates against every possible situation. I believe my current gear combination outclasses anything that could be considered "full set" and I believe past certaint level specialization becomes hinderance and not an advantage. I'm open to prove my points to PC players. I often hear defeated enemies asking what the fuck and wanting to trade to see my items, and I'm talking about decently equipped guys here.  My character can stand about 120 shots from BE .50 cal shots (no vats, build for maximum possible non-drugged damage output and maximum stagger) before he drops down, assuming you'd hit me with all of them.
---
I will probably publish some better prepared and argumented guides few weeks into survival mode. I believe the first weeks to be "show me what you got" period and I don't want to show all my aces yet.
---
I will return to adventure only to join and play together with people who'll refuse to go survival, and it will be strictly PvE. Give tips to new friends etc. I'm completely disinterested in spoiling the joy of PvE bros and gals by bombing their houses.
---
I want a point of my experience to be gathering my junk and aids solely through survival and trading, because I think I am the ultimate defining factor of my own enjoyment with the game and by my own standards I want it spicier.
---
There's a "Draining AP" joke in here somewhere.
---
Because I'm fucking playing the game. And players can and should fucking expect better from fucking Besthesda. 
---
I was actually kinda sad that we couldn‚Äôt change light colour, hope to see an update on this! 
---
Solid plan bro!
---
We're all definitely waiting with baited breath to find out. The game is so boring without you!
---
AIDs is not gay, it affects anyone. And btw, being gay is not a bad thing so that's a weak insult.
---
can you be more specific about the mod - what it doe in the game?
---
I think they mean that other weapons, aside from the TSE, furious and bloodied will feel more powerfull. 
---
By playing Adventure mode and just buying the weekly legendaries I want from people lol. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe how much alcohol the weekly wanted me to drink. 
---
Wait a minute...?  
---
Markers are getting used to show us whether someone has their gun out or not? Are you been serious? Why do you keep adding these weird little artificial systems that hinder organic interactions.
---
Let the player's decide whether their engagements are friendly or not, guns out or not.
---
My character in survival wouldn't be focused on building pretty skyscrapers, like my adventure character would, so no, it's a non-issue for me.
---
If you want more information go to his post about it on the nexus
---
Well, it‚Äôs the same patch as the survival beta but the no-slap-damage change isn‚Äôt part of the beta, it‚Äôs a change to adventure mode 
---
Smell-o-vision üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Go back to AA.  Stop playing FO76.  
---
I would honestly assume so
---
Dude...It's just a video game.
---
Honestly people get offended over things that just don't matter, seriously in what way is that actually hurting you and someone else?
---
Something tells me survival will be a mess of level 100s+ with fully kitted out gear and weapons that get you in one hit. Maybe I‚Äôll be surprised 
---
I appreciate your honesty!  I am terrible at PvP and really have no interest but I was thinking it would be cool to make a stealth character and just run around the map hidden listening for gun shots, seeing where they lead.  I won't be on top of the scoreboards but I should make for an interesting target for others lol!
---
Meh
---
That's what got me too! They even have the handwriting on the signs right! So cool to see!
---
Ah this could hurt. My character is based on one shot with melee from stealth. Very hard hitting but I can't take much damage. That was always the risk I took in PvP, but it was fun. I won some and lost some but this could be bad for my build. See what happens.
---
Oh being one shot in anything makes me just wanna put the game down unless it took the skill that vats removes. Dunno I think automatic guns will be the new meta, good thing I've been running a full auto build for a while now.
---
While AA may use rock bottom, it's a very common phrase for when you can't sink any lower in a situation. Does AA have "Rock Bottom" trademarked?
---
Call down
---
Rock Bottom existed as a phrase way before AA was founded. It goes back to the 1800's.
---
But remember before getting too offended that the dystopia that is the Fallout timeline has the American government doing some immensely shady stuff, asbestos everywhere, cigarette machines in hospitals and soda with Strontium 90 in them.
---
Fallout is at it's core a cautionary tale of what not to do.
---
Lore wise it makes sense for it not to appear as often...
---
I‚Äôve got a beautiful compound just outside of watoga station, and it would be a pain to move. Honestly, my plan is to leave it like that. It‚Äôll get destroyed, sure, but that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll leave my home as a smoking crater, and place/store workbenches as needed. Then in a few weeks when I‚Äôve completed all the challenges I care about, I‚Äôll return to Adventure mode, rebuild, and go on with my life. 
---
Totally understandable.  
---
Happy cake day!
---
On PC:
---
Want: Fasnacht Floor confetti, flag pole with the tube shape with the cross, the helvetia flag banner, and the branch garland, donut recipe
---
Have: The normal masks...owl, soldier, giant, witch, and of course the beret.
---
And is this how they nerf melee?
---
The decision has been made. Accept it and move on.
---
Seems like people are reporting bugs here so I guess it won't hurt that I do the same.
---
* The Omicron letter (O) in the Greek Letters plan can't be placed properly. Video clip here: https://i.imgur.com/fgggU7D.mp4
---
* There's a misplaced or duplicate edges/curb for the river in Berkeley Springs floating above ground. This was introduced some updates ago. Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/tT5sjX6
---
* Invisible creatures can attack and even kill you before they are visible on screen / fully loaded.
---
* Horde event leaders/bosses can be killed by a nearby group of non-player enemies and therefore end the event before players have gotten the chance to get there and kill it themselves.
---
* Some legendary ghouls are missing their Legendary prefix.
---
* Legendary items with multiple legendary effects can no longer be inspected at vendors
---
* I have my All Rise equipped to my "1"-favorite slot and my Zealot Super Sledge equipped on my "2"-favorite slot. Quitting the game or disconnecting the server unfavorites my Zealot Super Sledge and favorites my All Rise to "2" slot rather than "1" it originally was on.
---
* There's a T-posing ghoul corpse not far from Whitespring. Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/42REzyq
---
* The Watoga BOS vendor has a tendency to follow enemies far away from it's location making it very difficult to locate.
---
* Some new content are one time per server spawn or one time use. If one or more items has been used you need to server jump and potentially re-find some of the one per-server-items. This have to be repeated several times if you're really unlucky. Some more info here: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1fe6k/fallout_76_secret_nuka_cola_quantum_power_armor/eilr422/?context=3
---
** Some world objects like keys, keycards, passwords and such shouldn't be one per server but per player and/or with a high respawn rate.
---
* Recently added doors and map markers doesn't show up right away. For instance, the map marker for Big Al's Tattoo Parlor doesn't show up on the map right away, the same goes for the door itself that leads into the parlor.
---
Quality of life suggestions:
---
* Camp Blueprints
---
** Using "Select structure" on a large building should display a message saying that the building is too large to be turned into a blueprint when it will surpass the max Blueprint Budget.
---
*** Currently there's no indication of why you can't select the entire structure, for a while I actually thought that function was bugged until I tested it on a small enough building.
---
* Remove the invisible ramps on camp foundations. We got stairs and "Foundation With Ramp" for that sort of stuff.
---
** For me personally it's more of a annoyance than a quality of life. I'm sure there are people who disagree with me on this though.
---
*** Related bug with these invisible ramps: I'm unable to jump while standing on top of these
---
* The misc items "Claim Token" and "Token" should be weightless like "Mr. Fuzzy Token" are, or at least have a lower weight than 0.1.
---
You do realize that this game also has drug use in it. Has had it for YEARS! For some reason no one was offended by it. Recovering drug addicts have the same issue. My best suggestion is if you are offended, you should remove yourself from the situation. As AA teaches you.  
---
I need those daggers. I MUST have those daggers! Please be a switchblade!
---
Yup. I'm running around in excavator right now just for the weight. Lol
---
They should have gone with the "condition fulfillment" instead of raw chance to drop those items..
---
At least we would've figure out day one, that if you complete this event using different conditions (e.g. number of survived bots, different combination of said bots etc.), you'd get a different reward each time. So this would eliminate the frustration of not getting a rare item just because you have a bad mojo (and apparently all 100k+ of us had it), and would allow a bit more versatility for the event itself. People would form groups and farm the event based on their needs.. community work would be involved as well, rather than just showing up hoping for the best.
---
&gt;"  I'm really tired of all of the dailies involving alcohol and I think some of them promote a dangerous approach to drinking "
---
Im really tired of all the firearms in the game, I think the use of firearms in the game promotes a dangerous approach to conflict resolution. 
---
Good feedback! Hopefully they address
---
There are downsides only when you stop drinking,  aren't they?
---
Crouching cancels sentinel as I understand it. Not sure you were but assuming since invisible-could be why-I could also be wrong about it cancelling
---
Hahah, yeah, EVERYTHING IS USEFUL! I might need it sometime in the future *never use it again*. 300hrs on F4 and about 80 on F76, just picking everything 
---
That's what *she* said.
---
I was already one step ahead of this, I've spent the last 2 weeks searching around the map for locations I can put a hidden camp in or around places.
---
I'm going to start survival with a new character so my nice flashy camp with my main ain't effected.
---
I've already found a couple of sweet hidden spots for a possible new camp.
---
I've been thinking alot about this of late, my new camp isn't going to have generators or anything else that creates a noise that could potentially alert players of my caps location
---
Concise, to the point, and completely same lol
---
It doesn't matter if they are in the promo or not, dataminers will find them and people will get upset when they don't get them. It's only cool to have a rare item because it's rare.
---
This one seemed like a Whitehouse Down reference 
---
Already an auto rifle build so I'm just staying as I am, but think with the new balance to damage faster fire always come out on top. We'll definitely see though
---
Yes, the new weekly challenges (and their rewards) are specific to Survival. 
---
It‚Äôs seriously bs if you ask me I run bloodied so now I‚Äôm useless cause I‚Äôm 1 hit I‚Äôm dead and I rely on just doing a dick ton of damage
---
"hitting rock bottom" is what has to happen before recovery can begin, and all of the aspects of the challenges could definitely qualify. Their use of the phrase is very specific and exactly the same as the usage in recovery.
---
The first step is admitting you want an AA in your camp.
---
That's the thing.  These ~~raiders~~ griefers don't let the victim let it go.  They don't finish capturing the workshop.  They kill the victim, then stop the capture, then restart it after the victim respawns.  
---
That's funny. Because 5.56 was the only thing I used it for. Lol. You can also do fusion cores there though can't you? That's gotta be nice. I mean assuming it is the same weight as at power plants I guess 
---
More face paint too
---
Ayy Lmao
---
Vats crits are probably no stronger that normal bloody shots that much you can probably guarantee 
---
Yeah but you look cute in a dress though.
---
There's a damage exploit that lets people increase their damage exponentially...
---
I beleive if you get a stagger from any attack the sentinel effect does not work.
---
I am sorry i did build church for our lord savior Mothman. My soul is now his, i can't join you.
---
We could put in a bit of elbow grease and a bit of abraxo to buff out the worst of the damage. It's after the war, yes, but it has been only 25 years. That's easily within time to fully restore an item to good condition.
---
I want him to antagonize me into confrontations with the NPC enemies and run over to them once their dead and loot them for me. Taking all of their stuff and having a max carry weight like the companions in FO4.
---
BURN HIM BURN HIM BURN HIM
---
SHOOT HIM SHOOT HIM SHOOT HIM
---
LOOT HIM LOOT HIM LOOT HIM
---
I believe the strongest way to play the game is to simply move your camp and use blueprints to quickly place your house and farm whatever resource you need at the time. I live by lead for a few days, then maybe I move to junk piles if the night is going to be spent in nuke zones... stack 1000 of a resource and forget about it for a while.
---
I was hoping griefers who slap damage, get whisked off to survival 
---
God bless you, good sir!
---
Is adrenaline glitch fixed? It was allowing to rise DMG as much as you like
---
Talking about caps. How much would be the weight of 25k caps in real? 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wv1fb/pchow\_to\_change\_fallout\_76\_pipboy\_light\_and\_menu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wv1fb/pchow_to_change_fallout_76_pipboy_light_and_menu/)
---
Enjoy. Credit them, not me.
---
So much for hoping that the Dailies would be fixed this patch (especially anything in the Mire and Heart of the Enemy).  :/
---
I still play way too much and love the game, but it would be nice to do some of the content that vanished months ago from my character.
---
Can you fast travel still to them?
---
Show me where the big bad PvPer hurt you.
---
I have my standard defense tower structure blueprinted with turrets, genny etc. Plus a blueprint of a raised platform with turrets that I drop for perimeter defense. I have my basic workshop done in a minute. (Contractor is nice too)
---
Is the random aid drop limited? If I have 20 stimpaks am I risking all 20 if I get killed? Does aid drops include water, food?
---
As someone who is short and fat, I cry every time I hear *Mister Five by Five* on the radio.  Bethesda, how dare you?  You're being ableist against people who are genetically incapable of being the height that society deems appropriate.  People - especially men - suffer so much in our culture if they are short.  The suffering from this discrimination causes me to overeat, which is doubly bad when you don't have the tall frame to support that appetite.   This will lead me to an early grave, and Bethesda thinks it's funny.  I don't think it's funny.
---
Lol that‚Äôs my point - we have no way of knowing that. I‚Äôm not pushing one way or the other there‚Äôs pros and cons for both! Just seeking insight into why
---
Rock Bottom was a phrase long before AA became a thing. They don't own a trademark or copyright on it. 
---
Where‚Äôs this propaganda you are talking about? I can‚Äôt find it.
---
Just chiming in to say that I'm glad there was no guarantee about being able to grind enough to get a rare mask.  I've seen them on other players, they're beautiful, and I'm okay with not getting one because it makes them actually really rare and exciting.
---
If we're adding outfits from past games, what about an Officers trench coat like Colonel Autumn's?
---
Are we allowed to use mods now or does it still carry a risk of catching a ban for modifying the game files?
---
We're always pissing ourselves, just like in real life.
---
It's all I ever use it for too. You can make fusion cell ammo, cores are still only at power plants.
---
just eat some grass youll be fine
---
Promote to death? No thanks. I choose raiders freedom!
---
and then i get dced and my creation is gone
---
Glad to know there's a market for these. Are you on Xbox?
---
Won‚Äôt they become wanted? 
---
All wanted players are shown on the map, in both survival and adventure. 
---
When I saw someone named something like DannySmith10152007 I thought to myself... Yeah, they really should be hiding some of these names.  People could literally find some of these people using these account names, and that is a horrible idea.  
---
So is that you in the Bender mask? 
---
Get three bounties in a day, you‚Äôre relegated to survival for 72 hours. Haha. Like a prison for the worst offenders. 
---
Sharing characters a bad idea
---
I hope they have hard capped every weapon, so more things can become viable. The 1-shot meta is very boring stuff. 
---
I've played a lot of games since. The original Nintendo, and the most memorable and fun experiences I've had were me getting my ass handed to me in PvP.
---
Btw, anyone kind of disappointed that Survival isn't more difficult? Like diseases don't go away on their own or carry weight reduced.  Oh man, a 400 stash limit in Survival would be brutal!  Yes Todd I deserve another, I've been bad!  Stimpacks take longer to heal and food takes 20 minutes now? Yes please, harder, I'm almost there...
---
*Ahem*. Excuse me... got a little carried away in the excitement. 
---
Err... they can still do that? You can still shoot a person on sight and deal full damage even if they have their weapons holstered, so I'm not sure what you are complaining about.
---
It's too late for that. All my characters are named "fart, butts, poop" and so on because my kid named them
---
I do recommend spamming that +team up emote if you're solo with no mic. Good luck, and try to make friends (but yes discord groups / social networks do speed up the process)
---
Reasons besides deathmatch: 20% exp, legendary rewards for challenges
---
Things counter-intuitive to deathmatch: no player icons on map, limited fast travel, lots of underground and hidden locations, chameleon mutation, chameleon armor effect, stealth boy consumables, stealth boy mods to power armor, large map that does not have a constantly shrinking boundary like battle Royale games, punishment of having s bounty out on you and being shown on map (if the killed player desires to put the bounty), and leaderboard that reveals top players (so those that wish to kill each other can easily find each other, and those that don't can avoid them)
---
Next question
---
.. that's kind of the exciting part as well. if you remain hidden long enough, are able to avoid confrontation long enough, you'll inevitably end up one of the top three on the server and become visible on the map...then the sweat can really start flowing :)
---
if you are addicted to booze it grants -1 to agility and another special, i do not recall what one. 
---
Addictions disappear on death.
---
I hope you can, it would really motivate team playing.  And not sure why you are getting downvoted.
---
Keep up the great work!
---
Can we please fix the armor penetration not affecting energy resistance, please add Scout Armor to the legendary pool and please add the nuka lamp to the atom shop
---
Vault tec paints are underrated. Glad they ared adding more.
---
OM effing G. Desert camo! 
---
Want it, need it. Will 100% be buying it!!
---
Almost impossible to get Sentinal or Cavalier stats on armor, and when you see it in the market, it usually goes for 17k+ in caps per piece, or in trade for other god roll items.
---
Ah thanks. Exactly the motivation i needed to try survival.
---
Turrets.. lots of turrets 
---
The rock says shut your candy ass mouth before he rock bottoms you 
---
What happens if you are "wanted" and server hop? Does your wanted level stick with you? What is preventing max level players with crazy gear just steam rolling fresh spawns?
---
There's an event called Leader of the Pack that pops up at Tyler County fairgrounds. Finishing this event has a chance of dropping the tamahawk plans.
---
Blueprinting is barely functional though. Once you reach any level of complexity it simply doesn't work.
---
you are doing great work, thank you, heres hoping Bethesda reads this list
---
Salty.
---
That's in the summer, it's not a part of the current slew of content updates.
---
Good point. Curious how weapon degradation works. Is percent reduction in condition per shot fired? Does full auto have to repair more frequently than semi? 
---
Survival does not have to be just PvP. If you just hide from other players in survival mode there won't be any positive interaction with other players either? 
---
Yeah, but keep in mind I said the ones I want. Some of these first 6 they‚Äôve shown are kinda meh. 
---
I'd love to, but look at almost all of the daily and weekly challenges since this quest launched. It's ubiquitous.
---
Junk isn't the only thing you drop, you also drop aid items now in survival.
---
There are also leaderboards, and the longer you are alive, if you are in the top 2 on your server, I think the patch notes said, you'll appear on the map. So a level 20 who's fresh and leveling with the 20% xp buff is gonna pop up on everyone's map, and proceed to get hunted down for his caps by the 200+ players.
---
It really isn't a good idea.
---
I like that I can still play with my pve friends in adventure mode without making a new character, but that's literally the only advantage.
---
The only benefit to survival is the 20% xp buff, and that's negated by the high level players who will make the low levels lives miserable. 
---
Umm.. Bear Proof trashcan you say?  Inside a building?
---
Like it was a stash box?  
---
Which would mean it was YOUR stash box?  
---
And you grabbed your own stuff?
---
And your only crime was picking the lock (twice)?
---
Yeah those 200 super stimpacks ... all but 10 are going to my mule lol.
---
They already are. TSE is weak sauce compared to a good melee.
---
It is like having older bad friend who force you to drink.
---
already not interested in the pvp and survival, it sounds like a place for tryhards and griefers, xo
---
**Workshop PVP should stay in the Workshop**
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: **WORKSHOP PVP SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP**
---
Still very vague on details for the PvP balancing but if all they have done is reduced damage on weapons I don‚Äôt see this solving the assassins/sentinel balance issue. If anything this will make it worst and the crit/stagger methods will be less effective.
---
You don't know me. I've been wearing the elf ears everyday since christmas.  
---
It is! They award their favorite masks with Swiss flags, and we all got flags that year. 
---
The only thing i am affraid of is ppl that wanna form a 'team' with you and you meet up. They kill u afterwards for cap farming
---
&lt;3
---
Hm, I get the feeling that people‚Äôs greed for caps will get the better of them in these situations. Hopefully there‚Äôll be some friendly wastelanders out there, but given the game scenario, they‚Äôll be few and far between.
---
Just a heads up, thats not the real BethesdaGamesStudios. The real name has an underscore after it, the one you pinged has a liking for feet. 
---
Depending on what is happening in the backend it could be a lot of work. The game may never "know" the id of the server you were on. Joining a friend on a server is easy because the information is current.
---
Imagine something like this (in reality this is more complicated): 
---
* player1 is in main menu =&gt; this.player.server==null
---
* player2 is on server1 =&gt; this.player.server==server1
---
* player1 joins player2's world =&gt; this.player.join(this.player.friendlist(PLAYER2\_INDEX).server)

Now this is all speculation on my part, but there is some evidence that this is the case: Have you and your friends ever got disconnected together? you still have to option to "Join team" in the main menu. If you try it, it will fail with an error because this.player.server==null for the player you want to join.
---
Ok, you might say: 
---
"but in your example the player who is on a server knows what server he is on? because this.player.server==server1" 
---
well yes, but actually no. server1 in this example can be an instance of the Server class. You can imagine the server being a house, when I say this is server1, I am not showing you a map with an address, I am putting you in a car, blindfolding you and taking you there. Even while you are in the house, you don't know how to get back to said house once you leave (again blindfolded), if you still have a friend in the house, he can shout his location and you can get there by sound. &lt;/end of horrible explanation&gt;
---
Again, this is all speculation, and I am playing devil's advocate here. Why did Beth do this? It's much easier to implement, they just have a bag of servers and hand one to you on demand. I'm sure they have an algorithm as to which one they give you, since nothing in programming is random, but that is besides the point.
---
I only have one character with probably 7 charisma. Maybe that‚Äôs why I keep getting these busted ass junk drops
---
I'd be happy to team up with someone who just wants to sprint thru a challenge and bolt.  Drop your junk and most of your aid, and switch modes for a quick run.
---
Have a junk armor build right now tho...  gotta revise that...
---
Yeah that was what I was thinking. Pack some vegan sandwhich stuff and maybe some vegan burgers and sausage and enjoy the other parts of the festival 
---
Not totally onboard with the whole scoreboard idea especially top 3 being revealed on map and removing the quickswitch button but the rest of that looks awesome! Do we have player damage immunity during raid events like the Scorchbeast Queen?
---
I dont think its weak, aslong you are able to keep the melee attacker on a distance 
---
About 121lbs. Average bottle caps (for beer) take 205 to make a lb. 
---
Wasting time on another useles char? No way! :D
---
In my base :(
---
not gonna lie i think the beret is pretty ugly as a cosmetic
---
Not really. If one manages actually hit my head with sniper rifle and it would one hit kill me, I would be totally fine with it. What I would not be fine with is scenario where player is invisible, sitting in bush and then one hit killing me with VATS that has 100% accuracy. One is high skill, low chance shot, other is just no skill, 100% hit kill thing.
---
But would you still shove wet spaghetti up a bobcats ass if it was a monday morning?
---
25k caps for the drum mag lever action! 
---
I kid I kid.
---
so a lvl 250 player loses 500 caps each death...people are going to run out of caps real fast..no caps left..then what??
---
It occurred to me this morning there may have been a condition fulfilment that's been staring us in the face the whole time. Did anyone run this event, as a group, with a high charisma character? While hopping I happened to notice a loading screen tip says charisma affects group rewards. It might have been that simple. 
---
so..who got the great idea for another attempt to force people into unwanted PvP by making some legendaries exclusive to the PvP mode?  
---
What happened to the promise of "you can achieve everything in both modes" given months ago?  
---
Gonna pimp my shotgun baby :)
---
.. don't forget, this is just a beta. things will be added, subtracted, and changed/re-balanced as we go..but ya, let's go "hardcore" on survival ;)
---
There are a few kicking around i've heard audible normally has the best remakes of older stuff you can only find on tape-rip and as far as i recall only the first book had a full cast that i've heard of it's got musical touches throughout it as well that one from 2015 i think it was an audible one but i honesty can't recall and playing it doesn't have any foreword about who made it by though so i'm not being massively helpful on this one sorry :/ 
---
good call on the generators, i was thinking about this too
---
at least the fusion generators are pretty quiet
---
Agreed. Never saw anyone get one and I ground that event every day. 
---
You're basically complaining that you can't one hit people.. LOL 
---
Yours is a flawed argument and has been put down ad nauseam here in the sub
---
Yeah that's got me wanting to do a 1-h melee build now :D
---
So mine is sticking around even through server hops. I honestly stopped using it. I want it to stay packed for an emergency 
---
You're not invulnerable with your weapon holstered. Even if a player approaches you with their weapon down, you can still attack and kill them if you choose. If you want to go the friendly route instead, you can try throwing up an emote or talking to them over voice to see if you can make a new ally.
---
Did you get the big update from like a week or 2 ago? that one was almost 17 GB
---
As I understand, in survival mode only way to get wanted is when you kill someone and the player you killed is willing to pay caps to put wanted mark on you. If you kill player in survival mode and he doesn't pay to put wanted on you, you wont get wanted mark.
---
And suppressor. Dodgy/Serendipity/non power armor +dr  optional. Lone Wanderer for solo players. 
---
But yeah, end game is all about legendary out of power armor gear. PA is just entry level 'good enough', or for those hoarders (like me) that want 200-300 carry extra capacity... or jetpacks.
---
Unless you would be able to throw your melee weapon towards your enemy XD
---
There are counters to those builds. 3 ranks of fireproof, blocker, and, if you‚Äôre in PA, reactive plates torso.
---
Fireproof stops the (still OP) TSE shotguns.
---
(NB: just the TSE shotguns I believe are OP)
---
Blocker and reactive plates help mitigate melee builds.
---
I would wait to see how this works, it may be by weapon type, so maybe the dragon max hit can still one shot, while a shotgun cannot. Time to see and test!
---
Don't know if you've tried again but I managed to get the quest done a couple nights ago
---
You sir have bird flu seek medical advise as soon as possableüòÅ.
---
I agree. When you've spent that long working on a build and you've grinded your ass of for the perfect weapon or payed a lot of caps for it, you should be able to do that much damage. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to play it. Although I couldn‚Äôt care less about the masks so eh. 
---
I get where your coming from..I think, No one is undermining AA and I have respect for anyone who was capable of using its support structure to turn their habits around...but getting offended over this seems like quite the stretch. The game is literally in no way, shape or form extending a hidden meaning behind this message.
---
 It's not a personal potshot at you. It's a phrase.
---
Alot of people hit "rock bottom" before alcoholics.
---
Kings and Queens used to throw themselves off ships and castles because things got hopeless, They just hadn't coined the terminology yet.
---
As far as the term itself, it originated as a sales price long before AA adapted it for their situation
---
"The use of "rock bottom" to mean "lowest possible" followed soon after, as evidenced by a Dakota newspaper advertisement of 1884 offering "Boots, shoes and rubbers in great variety and at rock-bottom prices.""
---
How many caps do they get?
---
Hoping there is some camp stuff as well. Still waiting on those stairs. 
---
So, charity work?
---
Ah, sorry for the misunderstanding and thanks again for the info
---
For sure :)
---
"Rock bottom" isn't an AA phrase. If it bothers you, then stop doing the dailies that involve alcohol. It's still new, they'll eventually change them as new content drops.
---
I think the whole Biv questline is stupid, and just choose to ignore it entirely. 
---
I think you get more caps in survival 
---
Auto rifles are repaired more than semi automatic  simply die to the fact they fire more rounds per sec. And tend to deviate from the target. 
---
I miss how in FO3, FO4 and NV the ammo that I wasnt going to ever use (and didnt weigh anything) became like having an extra currency for my character.  
---
The secret place only the best and wisest players know about. Every mob a 3 star, every drop a 3 star, the vendor carries unlimited caps, X-01 Calibrated shocks literally grow on the trees.
---
Whitesprings generate as many high level 3 star legionaries as any other farms (WestTek, Harpers Ferry, The Generals Steakhouse). Which is to say, not many. 
---
Your not wasting your time, your increasing your chance for a drop, which is what its all about (if your Legendary farming) 
---
50 atoms!
---
what about camp damage? !!!?
---
Why do these bug fixes from major patches take SOOOOO long to fix. Its been 2 weeks since that patch came out, and these bugs are still here.  99% of other developers issue things called "hot fixes" to fix newly created bugs. Why doesn't Fallout 76 ever do Hotfixes?   
---
it seems there will be no bounties for destroying bases, just killing other players if the player who was killed decided to spend CAPS to place the wanted status on the player that killed them
---
Yes you can use mods. They only banned people for using cheats mods.
---
Or we can adapt and make new metas? 
---
I do agree with you, but i can still see it work in some ways, hit later tonight we Will see, hopfully our builds are still solid, orelse i guess il go with a hybrid melee/gunner build ü§£
---
Do you have a way of tracking how many people play the survival mode? So you can see what a waste of time it was.
---
I love it when people tell me my argument is flawed but them come back with no counter.
---
Also for your information here's what the sub reddit voted up on the matter just a few days back...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/
---
The only thing flawed here is the BS coming out of your butt hole of a mouth.
---
Since we haven‚Äôt been everywhere yet in the game, i can‚Äôt speak for every place. But we are enjoying it so far. Some places are nothing like the real place. For instance, point pleasant and the Mothman statue aren‚Äôt very accurate. But the statue is much better in the game. Helvetia is surprisingly accurate, and it was really cool to see some of the details the got right. 
---
One thing we noticed was just the sounds and the feeling of walking in the woods definitely felt like WV. We knew it was impossible to make an entire state be accurate, but it‚Äôs really fun discovering places and thinking, ‚Äúoh I know where that is in real life!‚Äù
---
Yes, and hopefully they'll have the buttons that magically float in the air if you fast travel away from your camp just like FO4!
---
Its doubled.. 
---
&gt; I thought it was stupid as he was just gonna lose it all when he logs off 
---
Fun fact, though: the stuff sticks around after you log off, so the next person that claims the workbench can leverage the work you've put in. I've claimed a lot of unowned workshops that had structures, defenses, and extractors already set up. 
---
Which means to wear the sun mask you‚Äôd have to stop wearing the elf ears. 
---
So the sun mask would last until you find something new. 
---
Camps should be harder to destroy in survival mode IMO. I put HRS/Days of work into my camps and would not bring it to survival for it to be destroyed.
---
I would have to make a new character with a more low profile camp wit the bare essentials. I would like to make a Bunker Style Camp.  Ohh man im beaming with ideas.
---
Thanks for the tips! I am have some extra perk points I‚Äôm going to use for these :)
---
not to mention losing thousands of caps everyday...a lvl 250 character loses 500 caps each death..who wants to go broke?
---
There's no Murder in Survival, but other than that, Wanted still works in much the same way as Adventure. You will appear on players' Maps with a bounty amount and others may come try to claim it... 
---
"Rock bottom" *is* an AA phrase. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Another quality of life request:
---
 Please give us a "drink" option when we come across nuka-colas and alcohol instead of having to put it in our inventory and then finding it in our inventory to drink. 
---
Wish I could have run into you, this sounds amazing! 
---
You're being downvoted because you're being rude.
---
its ok!!! ive been searching sites for some new versions 
---
glad you are a fan too
---
Pity you can't stash your caps before going over.  
---
How many do they get regularly?  It is vague when I google...  seems to be linked to level?
---
totally understand that, only reason I kept going was the insane drive to prove it either way
---
There are a lot of folks with duped sets of Assassin Sentinel armor and duped bloodied explosive rifles. Sad to see that they will able to walk into survival mode with them. I was really looking forward to this more hardcore mode but this makes me not want to play. 
---
How about an automatic radium rifle as well?
---
probably all aid items and it seems you need now only carry few aid items in your inventory, because...first: you drop some of the aid items. So less you have, less you lose. Second: you no longer can spam stimpacks, so there is no point having them all with you.
---
Bureau of Tourism is still bugged for me, I finished it and even got Trail Warden but the quest is not in my finished (or unfinished for that matter) quest log and the following bounty hunter quest has not started...
---
Ag center,water pools between the greenhouses out back. There are 3-4 plants.
---
I'm not for sure. But if they have time to  fix robobrains from glowing inappropriately, it sounds like they have enough time to work on real UI improvements. And if we don't keep on asking, they'll feel no pressure to implement any. So I'm going to keep on asking.
---
Thanks for the info, more and more people seeing the same thing, and no one can actually account for a single mask dropping.
---
Cavalier armor disagrees with you. Too bad everyone has that too.
---
The word existed in it's current meaning long before AA,
---
http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/forums/viewthread/681/
---
Oh, okay. That makes sense. 
---
Two pools behind the Aggrecultural Center in Flatwoods have 3 plants growing in them.  With Green Thumb I was able to collect 4x berries from two of the plants and 2x berries from the third.  1st pool had 1 plant with 4x berries.  2nd pool had two plants, one with 4x berries and one with 2x berries.
---
Cranberry bog go south of Watoga station, when you hit the water you will see floating berries they are all over in that area, just look around in the water.
---
This is what happened or something like it. Switched from handmade to lever to get some quick snipes off on a hermit crab. Also just right before this happened I had a poop my pants moment when I accidentally vats looking for the hermit crab and one shot a Wise moth man instead out of nowhere!) 
---
I honestly think the moth man blessed me with this ammo capacity. 
---
Next thing you know I‚Äôm thinks to myself as the hermit is closing in, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt reloaded yet‚Äù and I look down to see 62 left in the tube hahaha 
---
I just wish there was more clarity regarding the odds of getting a rare, and how to increase your chances (seeing that 5 robots alive didn‚Äôt change much). Obviously telling people they have a 0.03% chance of getting a desired drop may be discouraging to more casual audiences, but knowing the odds is better than a conspiracy that it‚Äôs impossible. 
---
Honestly though this whole thing could‚Äôve been avoided if they had tiered rarity, with a say 2% chance of an ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù and a 0.03% chance of a rare. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, there were a lot of things I didn‚Äôt like that much about the parade, but I did appreciate that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsomething to do‚Äù. 
---
I've been looking through perks.. having a hard time finding anything that would allow you to withstand that much damage, even as full sentinel, assuming you get staggered. Typically if I CAN stagger someone, they drop instantly. Could you withstand a pain train stagger + 1600 damage BE harpoon gun hit, assuming that you don't get a lucky dodge / serendipity proc?
---
I don't see why the fashion choices I make with my character matter to you. I'd probably wear it for 100ish days straight then start to swap between that and said elf ears.  
---
I doubt we will get legendary power armor for a while. Legendary power armor would make regular legendary armor obsolete, and many of the power armor mods provide effects that are similar to legendary effects, such as an increased special stat or going invisible while crouching. If they do add in legendary power armor, I hope it‚Äôs limited to one star.
---
I understand where you are coming from, and why you would be sensitive to this.  I truly do. 
---
However you do have to realize that this is a game, and while Bethesda may take your request seriously, you should know that as a developer it is insanely difficult to make a completely "safe" game with such a diverse audience.  
---
Just the nature of the game in a post-apocalypse with Raiders (and even by looking at past FO games) should hint at the type of game this is.   Any post-apocalypse setting is going to have people at their absolute worst, which you may have had the unfortunate experience to have to deal with.  This isn't a game series that's terribly afraid of offending people.  
---
using the weights from [this](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-a-single-metal-bottle-cap-weigh-from-a-beer-or-soda-bottle) anywhere from 55.12 pounds to 122.4 pounds
---
I haven't encountered any issues moving my house every couple of days with its internal wiring and I always have complex turret systems ready to drop on each workshop. sorry you've had bad luck with the system though, its my favorite part of the game 
---
I seriously also want to know why.
---
All this stuff is great, but there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to see in Adventure Mode yet‚Äî-contesting workshops needs to be limited to the workshop zones. 
---
The current mechanic that allows players to be attacked anywhere on the map after a workshop is contested is illogical, confusing and easily exploitable. 
---
I'm actually thrilled about the new mode for the opposite reason: I hate how PVP was shoehorned into 76, and the complete removal of "slap damage" in Adventure Mode removes a lot of the potential for abuse.  Segregating PVPers into their own servers is an even bigger step.  I'll be happly wandering the wasteland in Adventure Mode with even greater ability to ignore that my Fallout experience is bizarrely multiplayer.
---
Guy did this up a tree yesterday then started to nuke players and robots before the end,kids never grow up.
---
i kind of see there point. if i spent months getting to 50 and specing heavily into a sniper build to 1 shot my enemies i would be kind of disappointed if the only enemy i couldn't 1 shot was another player in rags,
---
I saw one old man winter mask on xbox last night
---
I hope they'll be doing more events like this, it was a lot of fun to share a common goal with such a wide variety of other players, and the robots were a real hoot. The devs gave us a great time on that one.
---
&gt; fwiw, I've done the event ~120 times, at least two runs with all five bots and no mask drop.   
---
More and more it feels like this is the issue, so many people seeing the same thing.
---
Are servers back up? 
---
super mutants drop tons of gun powder
---
I've found my self looking for guns to use when I have a high amount of a certain ammo
---
I might just play for the XP bonus, since I have limited time, and just try and dodge pvp like I do normally anyways.
---
So be careful who you team with
---
The PA armor types / levels I have found so far are:
---
Raider - L15 - 40
---
T45 : L25 -35
---
Excavator: L35, 40, and/or 45
---
T51b : L30 +
---
T60 : L35 +
---
X-01 : IDK the levels, I dont have it yet.
---
From in game reading, Excavator is a variant of T45.  
---
As T45, it has lower DR than others, but its bonus is 100# additional carry weight and more mats at ore nodes.  
---
Also, I dont think you can upgrade it - that is, if you build it at 35, you cannot update it to 45 - you have to build it again at the new level.
---
IIRC, then I think there is a mod to increase the weight capacity even further.  Not sure if there is something similar for ore.
---
I've only had Excavator a couple days, and I havent compared the actual specs, it seems to have less rad resistance than T60.
---
I'll let the team know?
---
Can but it's way more fun to just Leeroy Jenkins it.
---
Dev Room, if he purchased it from another player....   
---
And this is the problem, we can't account for a single player actually getting one of the 5 uncommon or rare masks..
---
It‚Äôs a game ...
---
There's no way to click a profile, other than the "Add friend" button. 
---
well if its blueprinted, like the OP is talking about, you can just re place it, or you re join the game you just got disconnected from by going to recent players in social the social tab, and joining off one of them. 
---
More uncommon based on the plan drop rate I've seen, so congrats on that!
---
If I can't one-shot someone with a crit headshot specialty build, I expect people with Assassin/Sent to not be invulnerable either. I want balance, not just one build and set of armor that is competitive. By the way, you know how you can NEVER be VATSed? Crouch. Or use a stealth boy. Or Chameleon. That simple. There are LOTS of counters for VATS crit builds, but but not so much for Assassin/Sent. Every other build that ISN'T that is basically designed around countering it. That seems fair. Then take away what COULD? Yeah, that's balanced...
---
I heard some people in area chat saying that in Adventure Mode other players will no longer be able to destroy your C.A.M.P items. I don't really care all that much, but I didn't see it in the notes. Is this just a rumor?
---
R.I.P ROLEPLAY
---
Sadly, these options do not exist. There's a button for "Friend" and nothing else. :(
---
Kind of a weird place to drop them.
---
The r/Market76 sub has a discord channel you can join.  On the discord, there is a subchannel just for asking about trading prices.  I'd highly recommend checking it out once you have a few items you want to trade or get, and just ask on the price-check channel or browse the history for similar items.
---
D - My magazines empty themselves during fast travel. Go to shoot immediately after fast travel and have to reload. Weird stuff. 
---
I wonder if he could be more dramatic
---
I need an intervention, I know ;)
---
Yeah I'm going to be honest, none of the legendaries stand out to me as something I'd actually use over my current gear.
---
Haha ! It made me laugh :) 
---
One should exist! But the only option currently available is "Friend". 
---
So if your level 100 you lose 200 caps in death thats a lot
---
Got that hazmat suit on hotkey
---
You're scared of pvp that's the reality. You want to one shot people because you're not good at pvp.
---
If that is true the Community would loose their minds..
---
It‚Äôs for the Excavator armour 
---
For me, I play as a stuck up rich bitch. My hair is perfect, my makeup is caked, my clothes are clean and pressed, and I switch outfits every 30 minutes.
---
Lore wise, theres still cleaning products in the game. A lot of them, really. Abraxo has no shortage and it seems to be used for almost everything. I like to think my character goes the extra mile to keep everything pre-war as possible. I mean she can build a fusion generator, there's no reason she can't shove her clothes in a bucket of hot water and clean them with Abraxo.
---
Agreed. Thats why we're headed there!
---
And corpses.
---
No more one shot melee builds? Am I speculating correctly?
---
By camp you mean 3 rows of turrets with a bed on the middle right?
---
What they could do is probably make it if you logout turning combat you lose all aid or something like that.. It should give you a warning when you try to logout. 
---
Yeah it's just a shame that this is the carrot on a stick they are dangling for survival mode. It just overshadows what could have been a new and exciting experience. Unlimited migration just waters down survival mode seen as though you don't have to stay there.
---
No one! I personally can mop the floor up in pvp but i hate it. Its a pointless dick measuring contest. The whole reason my setup is assassins sentinel is because of the little morons who think its cute to slap me and run. Or the ones who try to bait you with a hidden friend... i love the messages i get when i shut that crap down! But my heart is always with the real fallout and the way its played. Id much rather work with people then beat them down. Im not losing my hard earned stuff! 
---
Side note i love how my original comment was down vote. Probably one of the griefers i took down in one hit. I love griefer smashing!!
---
Damage reduction while running. End up taking a 1/4th of damage while running.
---
I'm running a bit bit of a bloodied build with unyielding and what I've found is rada cool,nerd rage and ironclad are very good cards to help you survive longer.
---
Might be cool to set up a camp that lures people into traps. Might Mines become viable? 
---
Cool thanks man.  Gambled and thought it was some magical cross armor thing.  
---
The CHA correlation isn't a hard fact, but a theory, but it seems pretty sound based on the observed difference in quality of drops...
---
I've found it pairs well with melee, you'll probably be putting a fair whack of SPECIAL into Agility which is where the pistol perks typically are with a melee build. Plus a slight AP/VATS advantage. 
---
For your information, everyone can be killed. You just don't know how to handle the situation well so you complain. 
---
Yeah when i got to this i was like "what the fuck?" Lol i thought i may try it, but no way i lose 400 caps, junk and aid on death. This is stupid lol
---
It's your answer for melee dudes. Throw that on a Unmodded Excavator chest peice and they'll be doing half damage reflected back
---
I agree.
---
Where did they mention camps in the patch notes? Isn‚Äôt this pure speculation at the moment? (Don‚Äôt know if servers are up again) That being sad, I hope there won‚Äôt be a penalty for destroying camps in survival. If you don‚Äôt like it, stick with adventure mode. 
---
That is about my mentality also. I am playing survival F4 very very slow and have not gone much further than Tempines and sunshine tidings and Im lv 24 :) But pick everything and work a lot on my bases :)
---
But loving the mysteries etc in Fallout 4. I am not using any google or anything, so everything is new!
---
Just because you put your tank up front, doesn't make him the leader.  
---
if you're getting that many disconnects, you have some router issues to investigate. at some point "but sometimes you get disconnected" can't be the counter point to every game function. 
---
I switched all my stash to my new build and left 3 sets of PA (a full raider and max level t60 and t51) north of helevatia last night bc stash was full. Told my buddy helping out that someone out there is gonna be pretty happy!
---
Don't stand underneath them their poo is dangerous for your health :)
---
Hi matt!
---
My name is Jason, I too am an addict.
---
Luckily I'm working the late shift today so I wont be home jonesing for my fix. I am just wondering if there will be a download needed
---
Might be changing the name to something easier because of the confusion lol. Are you interested though?
---
I have no doubt that Survival mode is going to be a giant meat grinder. Signaling friendliness is a great idea, but I can‚Äôt see anybody going there for anything other than wanton destruction. 
---
Th phrase "Rock bottom" originated in the 1800's. AA was founded in 1935. Just because they use the phrase in their program, in no way means they "own" it. It's also a common phrase used well outside of AA, I'm sure you've heard of "rock bottom pricing"? 
---
I am in **no way** disparaging AA, it's an essential organization that helps multitudes of people, I'm glad it's there, and I'm glad it helped you. 
---
Yeah. If you look the level action, its a basically only 20% damage boost. TS alone is already beating that and TS weapons aren't that sacred.
---
Ok I'll have to go back there. I searched through the bog a while but I got distracted in that area by a bunch of enemies.
---
They could make it like DayZ (I know I know) where if you log out in combat your character stays on the server for 2-5 minutes.
---
Good luck! I eventually got the plans after some 10 tries.
---
This individual wasn't afk, this person was changing outfits and taking a knee from the beginning of the Parade until the Parade ended, then they fucked off. 
---
Sadly you cannot pick up the items you build and "store" them for another workshop in the future.   
---
I tried it once, picked up all my shit, saw it in my "stored" section of the build menu, relogged, opened build menu, and Pooof all my items were gone.  
---
Sneaky vat crit sniper builds are going to rule this land. You mark my words
---
MARK THEM!
---
Oh God how I want that
---
I sure hope so. It would make Power Armor viable for PvP. They could go a step further and make Unqiue Power Armor pieces like the Tesla Chest/Arms from Fallout 4‚Äôs Automatron DLC. 
---
Did you notice the the Legendary item Purveyer has a Power Armor Helment in the video Bethesda has shown? My hope is the new system they introduce for ‚Äúscrapping/altering‚Äù legendary items also extends to Power Armor. 
---
 Right now all Heavy Weapons users are required to wear Power Armor for the Stabilized Perk. So an entire class of weapons has severely diminished results outside of Power Armor. Then again you can‚Äôt wield unarmed weapons in Power Armor. So maybe this is Bethesda‚Äôs planning from the start. 
---
Thaat is something that is going to be implemented in the future. It is not included in this patch.
---
other than it apparently coming april 9th no one knows anything about it.
---
i wonder if you drop mines at your CAMP, then fast travel away, do they stay there?  ill have to try it tonight
---
 i do know there is a limit of what, 3 mines only at one time that can be placed?
---
:((((((((((
---
Right? Alcohol is the new fresh water!
---
I run a pistol build as well. I focus on crits so I have 15 luck and 14 agility. And my best pistols have +50% vats crit damage. It‚Äôs hard to make pistols viable like rifles, but this, I find is the most effective way.
---
Sorry, no. I am a non-PA user, and want to see how Survival turns out first
---
I too will settle back into Adventure after trying Survival just for giggles.
---
Personally, I've never been griefed. Maybe that's bizarre, I don't know, but the multiplayer has been nothing but positive. Most just wave and move on..some offer or receive help on whatever circumstance we find ourselves in..
---
I do hope your being sarcastic.
---
Nah, the downvotes were to my original comment (which is polite and respectful), -prior- to my posting my response to the "why the fuck" commentor, which responds to them with the same language they're using.
---
I havnt gotten issues at all, I'm just saying when I played the beta and a few weeks after I took them all the time. But I never had junk to build on them because - each day I'd build generators, x-miners for those piles and a few turrets for defence. It eats junk way to fast to not be stored in a for later use workstation
---
ikr
---
Hey, you keep asking.
---
I will enjoy the game in the meantime.
---
More than likely, but they made it so you can't one shot players anymore, so there's still that window of being able to just log out the second you're getting sniped, and I'm more than sure there's a script or something out there that can let you insta-log instead of having to open the menu and all that.
---
Bummer, okay thanks
---
In the fallout series, I've slept with a ghoul, shot countless (innocent) animals and people, used chems (drugs), broke into numerous buildings, and drank more alcohol in an for of playing this game than I probably have in real life.
---
I guess all that should be taken out now....
---
I understand and am thankful that the OP had sought help for his/her issue. My entire immediate family had struggled with alcohol to some extent. However, alcohol consumption was in this game a long time before FO76 was a thing. Anyone who has played a fallout game before should know that, and those who weren't aware probably didn't heed the ESRB warning, which indicates drug usage (which alcohol is), or do any research on the game.
---
yeah me too, sometimes its fun to just burn through a  thousand bullets with a minigun for fun
---
i dont have any heavy weapons perks, but better than just dropping the bullets i guess
---
I really, really need a "lone wanderer perk" emote. I would totally follow you random guy, but i can't afford to lose my 20 % damage reduction, can you maybe just talk to me either in xbox message or area chat and we will go hang out at the next event? im MUCH weaker on a 2 person team than I am solo with lone wanderer.
---
&gt;excuse
---
I agree completely. The best tool we have to combat this right is to just coninuously block all players which is hardly an interesting mechanic.
---
I'm pretty sure I do, I'll have to double check when I get home from work.
---
I'm from Australia though so the hours I can get on Fallout might not line up well though.
---
I can be on in 12 hours or any time for the next 8 hours after that
---
There was a guy in my country who made an SKS rechambered in .223 that took AR15 mags I don‚Äôt get the point.
---
Drop or someone wearing it?
---
I'm kinda surprised that this hasn't been implemented into games already. It seems like a natural next step from adding support for people who are colour blind. Hopefully Bethesda sees this. 
---
I just want the weapons to be lower period.... do you know how much screen a mole miner's gauntlet takes up?
---
I would actually do survival mode if this was added
---
Yea man. Never ran into anyone using one either. Unless they just had it on while thumping music. 
---
Hello Matt and Jason.  I am Neha.  I, too, am an addict.  As we speak I am perusing etsy for more svg files, but truly I am waiting for my fix.  The tab is open.  I check it.  Not up.  My computer dings..."Fallout 76 has updated"...I think no way, they always take more than an hour.  But the itch needed to be scratched.  I try to log in.  DENIED. The shame.  Back to reddit and Etsy I go.  Le sigh.  And yep, there will be an update...unless you have it rigged to update automatically.  Have fun guys!  
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have fo76 on my pc
---
Wait.... you can get acid from bee's wax?
---
He's saying that people can one hit him and he cant do jack shit about it. legit complaint.
---
Because it's not as easy as you think (though sometimes it is...)
---
I was fixing to write out a whole list of problems doing something as simple as eliminating slap damage, but it was already several large paragraphs in my head, after only a minute of thinking about it.  Probably a waste of time all things considered, so I won't bore you with it.  I could give you 10 minutes reading material on how hard it is, and I'm not even a programmer...games, particularly multiplayer games, are a lot more complicated than most people understand.
---
I'd love you to do that in mine.  The bed is on the 8th floor.  I'd server hop and let you fall to your death. lol
---
If it is a universal nerf of all shots, then maybe it is feasible.  If everyone loses damage, no one loses damage.  My fear is that the nerf is situational, e.g. sneak shots only, or crit shots only, or shots with damage higher than N only, etc.  That could definitely mess up some builds.
---
Wasn't chameleon or stealth boys. He was easily seen. What perk or magazine?
---
You say it like I didn't want to do that either!  
---
I want to play on survival mode exclusively but when everyone can jump between adventure and survival it takes away the magic and struggle. Also if you read my post I didn't say everyone should start from level 1. While I do prefer that method I wouldn't be against characters migrating to survival mode with no return. They would only take their story / quest / exploration progress with them.
---
3000 atoms plz thx enjoy the game.
---
I just got the lemonade stand random encounter about five minutes before server shutdown today on the road right next to the Burning Mine.
---
All I wanted was the joker mask but that was too much to ask for the 50+ times I did the event üò©
---
Yep, totally agree! So cool to get to see other players up close, the variety of weapons and outfits.. hardly ever saw two players look the same..
---
Assassin/sent are not invulnerable. You can diversify your weapons a bit without god-tier items to at least partially mitigate any build. Even a fatman be effective for PVP without any perks. 
---
They can't vats after you cryogenic grenade them either, haha!
---
That's really cool.  I may have to start blueprinting cool workshops I run into.
---
I already have several blueprints for use in workshops -- variations of my preferred workshop building design -- depending on what I plan to be doing with the place.   This allows me to put down everything I want in a workshop (not including the resource generators and wiring to them) in one to four quick steps.  (For example, the basic structure is a single placement, but I have a "brewing porch" blueprint if I want to add in the new alcohol crafting.)  This also makes "build x of y in a workshop" challenges a breeze since the blueprints have a variety of feng shui and lighting.
---
You only should get the notification, IF you are in range of a atomic explosion. Everbody else just gets a visual feedback or something.
---
Yeah I had the same issues, that channel just south of Watoga Station has a few in it and with green thumb you will get what you need fairly quick.
---
99% ppl will leave game if they lose caps equal to 5-10 reward from event. 
---
Crazy so my friend who stoped playing at 350lvl gonna lose 700caps per death to 50lvls who gonna give him 100caps.
---
I am sad i will never see him in fallout again lol
---
Is that still going to be thing in the new always on PVP servers?  I thought those restrictions/rules were not going to be applicable in Survivor. 
---
 I may have misunderstood.....
---
Heavy metal armor is the best for pvp, as all of the commonly used weapons deal physical damage, and heavy metal has the highest physical resistance. It would be worthwhile to have one piece of armor with the chameleon legendary effect, as that prevents you from being hit in vats and makes you invisible while crouched, the only downside being it cancels the sentinel effect. You also want the fire proof perk, lone wander (if solo) dodgy, blocker, empath (if in a team) and probably life giver.
---
Can't be vats/can still vats. Seriously seriously op... I'd like to see it changed to where it you're using a stealthboy you cannot use vats.
---
Plus, there's a train station not far away. So even if you do die from the mobs or a higher LVL player attracted by the sound of gun fire decides to slaughter you. There's not a huge distance back from the closest spawn point.
---
no one is 'good' at PVP in fallout 76. the entire system is broken.
---
Judging by their location and how one is "Floating" I am going to say that someone had their CAMP there and dropped them in their CAMP.  Then logged out.  Any items dropped on a "level" of your CAMP when you log out will remain floating there.
---
Could be that they did it on purpose, didn't want them any more.  Could also be that they were a player that "disconnected" while sorting their Power Armors and was using the Drop instead of Place option.  This would cause them to lose their Power Armors (and likely be upset) but unable to return to the server since you get randomly placed unless you have a teammate or friend still on the server.
---
You made your fashion choices open by making a public stink about them. 
---
And when I expressed my view, you said I was wrong, but only proved my right because you can't wear the ears and mask at the same time. 
---
Thanks for playing. 
---
I think it was somewhat understandable for the "soft" mode, to deter people from constantly attacking others.
---
But in a strictly PvP mode... it's not needed.
---
An [AK-47](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47), one of the most common guns in the world, weighs ~8.5lbs. A [Dragunov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragunov_sniper_rifle) weighs ~9.5lbs.
---
Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt understand weapon weights. 
---
Ahh, Cool thanks!
---
I'm in the same boat. I suck at PVP. I don't do it much, mostly keep to myself. The few instances where I have PVP'd usaully didn't go well, ending in either 1. a draw of the other person and myself killing each other an even number of times, or 2. my getting slaughtered. But, I'm super excited for this survival mode, if for no other reason than I know what I'm getting into. Also, I'm a firm believer in the best defense is a good offense. Strike first, strike hard, and hope to God your enemy isn't sitting on a nuke (or a Fatman)
---
You're not being downvoted for asking for simple QoL improvements.  It is likely you are being downvoted for insinuating that today's patch is "meh" because it doesn't feature the QoL improvements you expected to have by today.  BGS has been improving, every week, in their transparency with regards to laying out what we can expect and when.
---
I would love some ap refresh pieces and maybe chameleon 
---
Everyone who has joined the same event quest will be friendly toward each other, so you shouldn't be able to accidentally gun down your event group mates.
---
Because it is not a major patch and never was. It is just content implementation with a few fixes. This is not Patch 8
---
Yep, there are those too.
---
Never knew that, thanks! Haha keep all he pro pvp tips coming !
---
From day one I've always felt stealth boys should render you combat less
---
In my humble opinion that shit should of
---
A) never work with power armor
---
B) been used as a more "I need to sneak past/steal this/gtfoh without being detected" styled tool
---
yeah, and it could actually be used as a safe location from other players. As it stands now, if someone wants to break into your home, they can easily
---
IDK....  
---
With Tens of thousands of reported events as more people weigh in on the various posts, and not a single confirmed instance of a drop, I am beginning to question if it was possible.   
---
Add in the 100% Successful runs, but no mask awarded being something many people who completed 25+ events saw atleast once, but very infrequently, makes me think there was at some point a failure, and that was supposed to be the Uncommon or Rare masks being placed in our inventory.
---
You can't lose what you don't have. Spend your caps, run around with barely any chems and have fun. It's what i'm going to do
---
Yea. We do that, then people come here and whine that nobody took their super ultra generous handouts. 
---
I am super chill. Just sharing a clearly unpopular point of view that some people want to earn their own loot or at least experience a few minutes of the game before having stuff dropped at their feet. 
---
Because the "wind instruments" only gives the tuba.
---
**sad tuba**
---
&gt;I doubt you'll see many successful PA builds in survival. 
---
Not in survival's current state, but I don't expect the current state to last. 
---
Wait, what? Who told you the Norinco SKS was more sought-after than the Russian? lol 
---
I wish they had smoke/fog grenades (not the artillery smoke) 
---
Not for me: I have a spawn well outside the building area and the turrets engage happily. 
---
Good line of sight. 
---
You‚Äôre welcome friend. 
---
No. I honestly don't care that much, imI was just wondering why it was all 1star armor all the time. I made the mistake of specing my character badly so even at level 50 the mire shreds me like a level 15. I spend time in the SD and forest because it's the only places that don't kill me. I'm stuck in a bit if q loop.
---
I had so much hope for this game but it‚Äôs got so many issues and from what I‚Äôve heard Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to really care so much anymore. It‚Äôs really disappointing and is getting that Battlefront II feeling for me. As much as I‚Äôd love to play the game, it‚Äôs lack of content, bugs, and settlements system kind of killed it for me. Just wasn‚Äôt what I expected.
---
I'm happy a survival mode is added as this is what I wanted from 76 to begin with... but having the Top 3 players visible on the map is a TERRIBLE idea and doesn't reward the objective for survival itself. 
---
I really hope you reconsider this feature soon, devs. Please, you're getting closer. 
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm REALLY excited to start using mines in survival mode. 
---
Big, nasty ones. Right next to vendors. 
---
Play a harder mode get better rewards.
---
It will go this way from start ppl will take it for that 20% xp bonus, holstering wepns when meet each other. Friendly as it was in rust when it came out. Later there wille be motherfuckers with best builds killing everyone, so oh my god. Did they really make that mode suffer on this? 
---
Yeah, I've bought and sold guns for years and I don't know where that dude got his information from. LOFL at the 'rinco being more sought after than the Russian. Tell that to the proud owners of the Russian 1954's *cough-cough*
---
I love PvP. Just not in a game that was not design for fair/ balanced combat. I'll just do my daily cap run and wait for next adventure update.
---
Really good for melee characters that need to run up on you. 
---
The workaround is to build modules, that you come snap (when it works alright) all together. Is the only way I found so far to transport my camps.  
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/images/618
---
Probably. I never handled a true russian kalishnikov rifle. Obama banned importing firearms from kalishnikov. We can only get slovak and chinese weapons now. No russian.
---
I agree!  
---
Stairs with different levels of steepness or that are attached differently to their bases would be very helpful.  As someone else mentioned, a spiral staircase that only takes up one "square" would be amazingly useful, and allow a lot of building opportunities.  As would a ladder.  
---
Yes and the honey jars at the honey house.
---
Lol fair point
---
Glad to see that PVP should effectively be a thing of the past in Adventure mode!!!  :)
---
Am I reading this right?
---
No more PvP if I don't want to?
---
&gt;Also, is there any evidence that spots help turrets? 
---
No. It's bullshit. 
---
You don't need to be invisible to be un-VATS-able.  You only need to be crouching.
---
People will collaborate and form teams. At leats this is what i (deeply) hope, because this would make Fallout great again. Imagine a community city or some sort that protect each other like u know from the Singleplayer Games, wouldn't be that crazy to see and thats just because Death actually really matters know and is not just a joke Arcade Game respawn.
---
People over 100level would avoid pvp because they did not want lose caps (not all ppl) so if you now lose twice as much, why?
---
I agree they shouldn't work for power armour, they have stealth boy torsos already anyways. But for melee they need it, especially when you pvp other players. 
---
Go to ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù in the subreddit menu.
---
My issue is I speced my character badly because I had no idea what to do during the beta, and I now need to fight level 45-65 enemies, but I'm as effective as about a level 20.
---
The whole point of said weapons is not to one shot assassins/sentinal abusers lol.. its def not game breaking either and I'm sure the one shot kill ain't leavin but less likely to happen as bgs said.. 
---
Honestly, it should not be level based.  If planned correctly, there is no difference between a level 57 and a level 350 in terms of ability with the exception of gear.  The 57 could have greater gear than the 350 by luck or caps.  Leveling for all characters should have stopped at 50 and then you are given an exp bar that grants the choice of perk or respec 1 SPECIAL point and then resets.  
---
totally agree! good points made here for future events
---
i know alot of super salty players now, they all felt the parade left a bad taste as NOONE seemed to be able to get those masks
---
which is really the opposite that Bethesda wanted, we should all have warm fuzzy memories of the event, not a grudge against the devs who made it so it was all basically false advertising lol
---
PLUS those damn robots walked so @#$@#$$%@ slow
---
There are ways to beat them people. Cavalier, wait until they check there surroundings stood still and bang... Sentinel make them come to you. I have chameleon armor, and chameleon for now and again and don't have any problems with these builds. Don't get me wrong some are hard and get me but for each time I die they do 3 times. I get in the green with my caps then off I go, a good stealth build beats all those who rely on op armor. Make people chase you, make them make mistakes. People get pissed off easy, use it to your advantage. 
---
Both games were developed along side each other so a lot of assets were sharded between them, though some have been updated a bit for FO76 use. Honestly forgetting if FO4 had an electric chair. Hmmm.
---
I sure do hope.so.
---
The new PvP mechanic seems to suggest a balance fix for the weapons but not the sentinel/assassins armor. But we will have to wait and see.
---
No, these things will kill me just like everybody else.
---
Then you will get that -50% damage to players debuff. Have fun.
---
We will find out more either this thursday or next thursday in the inside the vault.
---
Outstanding.
---
I shall
---
Still doing this? I got a request for a serum, and possibly some future business concerning more serums.   
---
Right now, I'm just looking for Twisted muscles and Scaly skin
---
I don't know if it was possible to get any of the Uncommon or Rare masks at this point...    
---
[\[PC\] I really think there is a error in the Fasnacht Day mask Reward system based on collected data](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5h3vj/pc_i_really_think_there_is_a_error_in_the/)  
---
With more than 12,000 events documented by 2 people, and dozens and dozens of people additionally weighing in, no one can account for a single instance of any of the masks being awarded, but many people saw a 100% Completion (no robot deaths) but a Mask fail to be awarded...   
---
Really starting to wonder if there was not a glitch preventing them from showing up in our inventory, and that very uncommon, arguably rare instance of no mask, but XP and plans being awarded when no robots died was in fact when we should have gotten one of them.
---
Yep, I made the same mistake many many levels ago.
---
definitely steering clear of you if I bump into ya..if I see you first that is.. :)
---
If I'm correct a non-feral turning feral is a crap shoot. Some turn within days, others it can take decades and there are those who don't turn feral at all. There would have to be some non-feral still hanging around. As for the scorched disease, ghouls aren't affected by it nor any other disease. Now if they did die fighting alongside regular humans we'd at least find a corpse or a holotape recording of one.
---
"Thanks for playing." Like you just won some game lol. Yeah sure, you win the jerk award. Congratulations!
---
That's temporary. The brewing station is still relatively knew and so they're going along with themed dailies and weeklies just until the newness wears off. Just ignore it and do other stuff. It'll go away.
---
Your damage is gonna get nerfed if you ran out caps 
---
Yessir the do! 
---
what was ever the use of a weapon like the fatman? fun of the explosion. using the best and high dps weapons is always what happenes in games with a competitive scene.
---
Which kind of makes pursuing them pointless, IMO. I mean sure the quantum paint looks cool, but I really wanted it for the AP refresh. (luckily a friend painted it for me so I didn't have to jump through all the hoops). But they've basically reduced it to an atomic shop item.
---
If you have any donut or sausage recipes, please let me know!  ill trade/buy them because i love carbs
---
Is it just me or did they create motivation for a new kind of server hopping? If you can go back and forth between modes, what exactly is the point of fast travel restrictions in survival mode? 
---
Dang I never got to do one , will this event be brought back ever
---
Thx
---
Usually takes 3 hours how long ago did they took it offline ?
---
They're why I choose to stay in Huntington when I visit for the Mothman Festival. 
---
Survival is pointless as long as people can be invincible using Assassin's/Sentinel.
---
Hi, id be down to buy/trade for the donut or sausage recipes!  on PS4. let me know!
---
Guys, I understand your point, there are lots of way to find people if you do the effort, this is not climbing the everest.
---
The point of OP tho was that it's quite a PITA that you can be kicked from your game just because they didn't invest in correct infra, and that you have, month after the release, no way to get back on a server when the events you start are server-related. 
---
So I get it, I can buy the game to my grandma if I want to be able to always join a server, or I can brainwash my friend in thinking it's not that bad of a game so they play with me, or I can hop through 12 fan-sites to find other players, but the point of OP still stands : a player should simply be able to return to his last server in case of a suddenly lost connection.
---
I‚Äôll probably try it out with my low level alt to get the extra XP.  Otherwise, I may only join with my main to do the challenges. 
---
Trading will get interesting, since we‚Äôll probably want to negotiate that we only want to meet in Adventure Mode. 
---
Hallelujah! 
---
This would probably be the best way to handle it, although that amount of time may be a little excessive for a game with frequent disconnects and crashes for a lot of people.  30 seconds or so should be plenty of time to get the kill, and not leave the player open to further shenanigans.  I'd rather go easy on combat loggers in favor of people who genuinely crashed/disconnected.  
---
I don't *think* I do, but I'll check the next time I'm on.  I know I have an Effigy plan and three or four berets, and plenty of each common mask.
---
I use semi auto as I'm parked for it and I want most damage per shot to keep resource cost down per round
---
the entire game is satire man. if you cant take it, maybe you should find something else to play.
---
I think that would defeat the purpose of trying to surprise nuke someone.  Once the nuke lands, the nuke zone should show on map, however.
---
 reflects 50% of the melee damage, last night we reviewed it and it does a lot of damage without having a melee build  I lost 40% of my life with each attack. 
---
The "crazy Russian" is Swedish!?  You just blew my mind.
---
Have you tested it with your friends? I've got no friends haha!
---
Tip for you, eating honey before using the jetpack seems to give you endless fuel, so long as you don't sprint . Not sure if you're a jetpacker but it's good to know!
---
Yeah that armor is the real deal. Essentially invulnerable unless you can get them to stagger. 
---
Nice! Mine is overlooking wayoga and that whole bog area, and you can see flashes from scorch beast attacks from a very long distance
---
Because a 200lbs increase is more than a 10% decrease in weight. Do you even math?
---
If they decrease my 800lbs of shit by 10% that‚Äôs only 80lbs. I‚Äôd rather have an additional 120lbs with the increase. 
---
The only thing I know that couners stealth boys is a missle launchers targeting computer, I've been told it will still vats you. 
---
Any chance you tried that vs a sentinel build?
---
A loud ass whistling as it fell from the sky would be so cool
---
You'd hear it and fuckin panic run to the nearest shelter, not knowing if you were about to watch a beautiful explosion or become vaporized into a shadow
---
Yeah, it just shows the chicken shit players who like to pick on lower levels when there's no risk vs players who legitimately enjoy PVP and will take the risk. 
---
I find myself humming it at work, in the car, at home....
---
This tops the list of best accidental glitches 
---
I'm sure new challenges will come with the new survival update today. Like "kill 30 creatures in new survival mode"
---
It. Never. Stops.
---
the stealth boy torso mod is just that of the Chameleon legendary effect as a mod, aka no moving
---
Holy fuck I want this
---
Not a jetpacker haha but I do know you wont get vats because I've pvped a lot and always with stealth boys. 
---
For real. I'm 6'2, purple mohawk, kilt, combat boots, and a had full set of acrylic nails on while I was there. I got less judgement from anyone I encountered than I do on an average day in my hometown. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen that since I played EVE. 
---
It is a mod, you can get Commie Whackers at Camden Park
---
Start taking workshops. They will gain you a ton of xp.
---
I missed it entirely üò≠ All work and no play make Kitty something something. 
---
I miss the mesmatron...
---
It's a mod for the commie whacker. 
---
Yeah it was crazy each one made 2 acids so each time I hopped and ran through there I was leaving with 40-50 acid. 
---
great!!!!! thanks so much, even if you dont have them i appreciate the kind gesture
---
oh, and very happy cake day!!!!!!
---
Was confirmed in the inside the vault articles that came out with fastnacht event, but iam to lazy to search for a link 
---
Yaa, I should of clarified that lol
---
I KNOW RIGHT!? I learned many years ago after watching Armageddon and, just like you, it blew my mind.
---
Correct, not everything is an easy fix like that, but some things are.   
---
Whats the harm in a small patch to fix the stuff you can easily fix tho?  
---
Is it Microsoft/Sony QA protocols holding us back from receiving hot fixes perhaps?   
---
I have just an explosive but it‚Äôs executioner. So the second shot always works. I use it for the novelty of the lever action. I prefer other weapons. 
---
I think it was one of the rewards from the first Biv quest to make Nukashine.
---
I got rock bottom yesterday when my camp was deleted from my game save. It was such a nice camp, not just a box full of workbenches like most.
---
Try reaching out to Microsoft. They might have another way to report people. Did you try looking up their profile through the ‚Äúfind a player‚Äù?
---
Oh okay, so I can mod the whacker, lol that is funny.
---
That's something separate and isn't due for quite a while yet. 
---
I want to play survival mode, but seeing how there's no real advantage between a level 50 and level 150, it's hard for me to justify playing much in survival if I'm going to be risking 300 caps every time I die. Losing junk + aid items + 100 caps seems like enough of a punishment to me
---
Dont ask jus play... smdh
---
50+ you are not any different than 500lvl. Not fair you lose more caps
---
Yes it‚Äôs coming later. The expected dates are all on the roadmap. 
---
It was never said to be coming with survival 
---
I understand why are you worrying but good news, Survival mod came the game because feedbacks. They are not going to evolve this game to PvP based, they just divided Pvp and PvE. So bloodthirsty players will enjoy too!
---
For another perspective, you know, we will get more PvE contests. Boozing, new quests, events, underground dungeon type zones, new creatures, raids etc. They will add new game mode too, it's mean this game won't evolve to PvP based game I hope.
---
And, I hope i helped you for a perspective about this. And don't forget, you are totally right about worries.
---
They take very little action points in VATS compared to other weapons.
---
You think federal regulations keep you safe but all they do is cede power to bureaucrats.
---
You need to check your flair.
---
But, seriously, it's a game.  A role playing game (to some extent).  Using dice is a basic part of the mechanism.  *Everything* is done using a RNG.
---
Not to mention that there's no money involved.
---
I'm also wondering
---
Not that many people seem to be affected but for those who are it's a game breaking bug: weapons damage input (for all weapons) suddenly dropping with 40-50%.    Not caused by changing perks, weapons condition, adictions, etc etc.  just random drops :(   still no news on that front from Bethesda
---
Don't forget to stop at Olive Garden to celebrate!  Its the American way of eating Italian!
---
I'm kidding of course, congratulations :)  
---
This too.
---
Never
---
I'd suggest using max level crafted gear. You can still dole out decent damage and be fairly resistant to damage without legendaries until you can get your SPECIALS in order and pick up some better gear. I didn't have a legendary rifle or all armor pieces until well after level 50.
---
I also spent a lot of time in lvl 20 crafted leather, just so I didn't have to farm balistic mats.
---
If you can find some peeps to help you with farming and events, you can level to respec/grab gear pretty easily.
---
Always attempt to help characters, crafting appropriate weaponry, armour for their level. To avoid ruining the experience nowadays usually craft an Underarmor Treated Vaultsuit, leather armour and a lever gun.    
---
As my C.A.M.P. base of the Vault Hospital is situated behind Charleston Station, my female Nurse Asylum Character is found lurking in this area. So it was surprising when visiting Charleston Train Station about to trade with a vendor notice a 25th level Female character who was literally starkers - No armour, nor underarmor equipped showing her skin coloured underwear to all a sundry. HOW INAPPROPRIATE. Immediately drop a spare Red Dress, an asylum uniform and a treated vault underarmour and walk off in disgust. :)
---
Another time again stopping at the vendor notice a similar Nurse character to myself in appearance (My twin sister hehe) except far lower level. Two minutes later dropped my spare Yellow Asylum Uniform, Hat, Vault suit and spare known plans.     
---
We dont know 100% how this works. It may be something like "you cant take more than 90% damage in one hit", or something like that. If it isn't, i guarantee it'll still be possible to one shot. If it is, then doing 90% damage then switching to another weapon and shooting again will be viable
---
Oh no, i just found out u lose there twice caps per death. Thats 400 for me.
---
"You only have to sacrifice 6 to 9 perk slots to counter this overpowered setup."
---
Thanks for this.  Very helpful!
---
i dont see a patch to fix not allowing me to not get in the unnumbered vault soo, kinda unimpressed
---
Only for bloody builds. Otherwise dmg reduction is by far the best. (Eg super mutants &gt; troubleshooters &gt; etc)
---
With my current build (4/5 sent+lone wanderer+dodgy for max 95%) my dmg mitigation against 500 incoming dmg takes over 19million resist to achieve.  
---
High defense is basically worthless endgame.
---
 Lol weak sauce...
---
No, we could not prove it with that legendary.  Let's try it today, we were tired of dying by a melee hit in every fight. 
---
If you didn't know already but if you run like 20 feet away from the stash it will allow you to search it. It's annoying but it's a workaround to it.
---
 \&gt;Existing characters can freely switch back and forth between Adventure and Survival mode.   
---
RIP fo76
---
Will players still receive a bounty for destroying another player's CAMP?
---
Lol there is one not far from where I live!!!
---
If I‚Äôm being a dick about it, it‚Äôs because its misinformation. People have been using mods since this game came out. The TOS changed a month ago. There hasn‚Äôt been anyone banned from using anything on nexusmods.
---
Ha it‚Äôs alright man, thanks for the offer
---
Yup, Survival is pointless as long as such gear remains overpowered.
---
You don't have to play in the PvP mode. You can still PvP on the regular servers in the same way, just can't slap anyone to death anymore.
---
Security for whom? So we cant put names on griefers or to protect people from griefers?
---
I try not to farm honestly. At least when we are talking about the turret farmers I think that's pointless. You're only playing less of the game and you're actively trying to do that. Instead of spending a few days of normal play with your friends you spent one day watching a turret do the work. Riveting I know. 
---
With the number of people that will use mods to make those with the stealth effect glow various bright colors I doubt you have to worry about hiding. 
---
Depends on how many caps you are willing to throw at it. I don't have that many spare of the recipes so they won't be cheap.
---
 I was never against PVP .. I was against not being able to choose when and where.  With that Said .. I am excited for this option as I can Play one Toon on Adventure mode and another on Survival - I Picture me in my sniper outfit running around like the predator avoiding groups of raiders as best as possible, while killing anyone from a distance. I will be deadly, I will be cunnning .. I will "cough" "cough" most likely get my A$$ handed to me Hahahhaha .. I want so badly to battle raiders , maybe get enlisted by a group of them and go raiding.. I don't know but it's gonna be fun. And then when I tire of the PVPing.  I can just switch toons and play Adventure mode .. The point is I can Now Choose .. and I can't wait.  
---
Lmao 
---
Depends on the update. Sometimes it 1-2 hours, but for larger updates it has been 3-4
---
There are like 10 other posts like this already, did you not check? Also nobody knows, just make sure you've got your update going in the background.
---
As stated, don‚Äôt be afraid to jump into high level areas and tag everything you can. Carry NO junk, expect to die a lot... at first. There is no other repercussion to dying which is something most new players don‚Äôt take into account. See you soon at level 50!
---
I don't know about "Demon Eyes," but the diamond eyes are already in the store.
---
high risk no reward* here i fixed it for you :V
---
I doubt this will be as unfair as ark but I like the way you think!!
---
[That is better then this!](https://i.imgur.com/kct4SdL.jpg)
---
 Will he show up more often? That would be cake. ;)
---
Definitely possible, although you have to keep in mind that not all PC players use controllers.
---
And, while I'm pretty sure the PS4/XB1 controllers do have stereo vibrator engines, I'm not sure what controllers that PC players may be using do support vibrations, stereo or not.
---
What they need to do is nerf vats melee lunges 
---
ok, how much are you asking per recipe?
---
Pic is contained in this article, so I linked the article instead. Can you see it now?  [https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/damien-cox/bethesda-lifts-the-lid-on-first-seasonal-event-in-fallout-76-fasnacht-parade/](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/damien-cox/bethesda-lifts-the-lid-on-first-seasonal-event-in-fallout-76-fasnacht-parade/) 
---
Can't help you as I'm on PC. But honestly, you don't really want them. They take a ton of ingredients, some that are really hard to find (like cooking oil which auto-scraps, and razor grain flower which is made from razor grain and concrete), and offer almost no benefit. Eating spoiled food will do as much for you honestly. They don't sell for anything either. But, to each his own.
---
Most games aren't as unfair as ark to be honest!
---
And since we have no information aren't you being a bit reactionary? I'm assuming a VATS crit headshot from a dragon will still drop a player's health to almost nothing. Carry a second for a quick follow up? It's a major oversight on your part if your entire build is based around solving problems with a single bullet. 
---
I think his voice volume is too low though, sometimes it's hard to hear him over the background noise.
---
I am excited about this. I enjoy mostly playing in the adventure / PvE mode but I might dabble in the Survival mode for fun. The PvP combat and balance changes are going to help a lot in both modes. When I‚Äôm adventuring i will be glad to only have to fight another player if I want to. And if I‚Äôm in survival I‚Äôll be glad to feel like that mode is more dangerous. 
---
Unless you have a workshop that gets challenged or challenge a workshop.
---
But to directly answer the question, if you have explosive weapons, the direct results of the explosions will not hurt other players, but if it causes an environmental explosion (like a car) then it can hurt another player, you just won‚Äôt be flagged pvp for that. 
---
Will a player receive a bounty if they destroy another players CAMP in survival?
---
It also makes sense if you take plan to mean that you're making the item. The "plan" for the red stove is you learning to paint the thing you already know how to make.
---
You know what the "best" counter for ass/sent armor is? VATS crits, or at least it was. 
---
Are sniper supposed to run up and try to melee someone to death now? The whole point of being a stealth vats sniper is to do a massive amount of front end damage. Which just got *nerfed*.
---
Not a bad idea
---
(known past) &lt;------------- (known present: you are here) --------------&gt;  (future) (doesn't exist yet, cannot be commented on factually)
---
Would like to see the MC show up occasionally perhaps. Instead of BURN HIM BURN HIM BURN HIM, perhaps "CHUG IT CHUG IT CHUG IT" at appropriate times.
---
Nobody‚Äôs answered the question yet... I‚Äôve got some on pc and wondering why I have them at all. What quest is it for?
---
I haven't used it since I played Elite Dangerous ;D
---
Any controller I've heard of has at least 2 vibrators, directional wouldn't be that hard.
---
Until next year's Fasnacht
---
We will se :))
---
They're also lighter freeing up more looting space and I think reload faster.
---
I'm impressed how similar they made the town in the game look to the real town. 
---
Heh. The way the Master of Ceremonies shouted "Hurray!" always made me smile, no matter how many times I heard it.
---
I'm really tired of these alcohol quests 'cos they fucking suck. 
---
A useless weight reduction perk...
---
Its free
---
I just spent 16k on a bloodied radium rifle for this 
---
Honestly I am not to sure i was sort of going to wait and see what other people where selling theirs for and then go from there.
---
I agree. Really irks me that I may as well be naked in pvp when wearing the best power armor in the game.
---
I hoped they make PvP good, but instead of making it more interesting, they made it unrewarding if you die you lose double caps depending on your level, your junk and on top of that, now you also lose AID, well nope i am not interesting sorry.
---
Will you still use a camp in survival mode or just log and go to adventure mode to use camp?
---
And that exploit is what exactly? I know about the stagers stagers cant 1 shot u, and no i was not crouched. 
---
Yeah, there's a lot of build issues left to address. I rebuilt my camp the other day using warehouse walls for the more industrial look, and found that nearly all of my signs and letters that worked fine on wood and concrete clip through the wall to the point that they're unselectable, requiring a scrapping of the entire wall to reclaim the bugged decoration. 
---
This is me. I figure I'll go In survival when I want an extra challenge of being sneaky enough to avoid another player (basically I love having some things in the game be dangerous enough to encourage you to be careful about being caught). 
---
Oh cool! When do you want to meet?
---
Small feeling of serenity.
---
As someone who is hard of hearing and for whom the noise of the scorched officers beeping is just in the range of tones I have lost the ability to hear, I fully support this idea! 
---
On the whole Fallout‚Äôs subtitles are pretty good but this would really, really help. 
---
VATS crits have always been situationally useful in pvp due to stealth/invisibility. This is nothing new. 
---
even if they did, in a week it would be the same 
---
What about the mod that does the same thing for power armor helmet? Or Recon Scope?
---
Don't nuke in Survival mode then? Anyone with a right mind, would avoid group events in this mode lol.
---
That's actually Camp Venture.
---
But yes.  I have had Tech Data show up in that level 3 locked floor safe before.  A nice little bonus.
---
yeah it's working for someone, but nor for everybody.
---
As I said previously, today i've been able to trigger it after patch 7.
---
In conclusion, I think it became available right after fasnacht events ended. Maybe it's a coincidence, maybe not, who knows.
---
Home Repair:   Similar to the Architect but will defend and repair damage to you CAMP.  Can be found wandering the wasteland with a hammer on his/her tool belt and a Super Sledge over his/her shoulder.  
---
Medic:  Will drop Chems on request.  Also will revive downed soldiers on the battlefield.  May also carry Nukashine.   After all, you need something to get through Med School....
---
Pc
---
ah i see, an opportunist lol
---
good luck
---
well there it is I glanced over that road map a few times and never noticed it before.
---
I wish I could take workshops again. At high levels, every time you take a workshop you get hunted down by a groups using the contesting exploit.
---
Yes x1000. This also gives the workshop owner motivation to fortify their workshops. As it is, there's no point.
---
Train Station camping and minefields is the new meta.
---
yes! thank you
---
and you are right, 3 out of 4 of those were unobtainable masks
---
I‚Äôm Xbox :/ Hope you guys are doing some video. 
---
Cryolator ond other such cryo weapons drain AP and make vats impossible.  Stealth boys work too.
---
In a few hours 
---
Somebody was wearing it I think somebody posted a picture of the same person on Facebook as well
---
Follow the overseers quest line.  It'll give you the backstory/lore, and have you fighting level appropriate enemies.
---
Building a small camp is OK, but dont go overboard yet.  
---
Basics only - you need the mats for other stuff.
---
In your travels, you should be able to pick up enough stuff to keep your weapons maintained. 
---
Scrap often.  
---
Scrap material weighs less, and will give you mods for later.
---
Goto your game menu and enable pacifist, at least for now.  
---
You are not strong enough for PVP -  to that end, I wouldn't take a workshop for a while, either.
---
Probably best to stay in the forest until at least L15.  
---
Theres lots to explore and find.  Fast travel is great, but walking will help you find places and stuff.
---
Do the events, learn what weapon is most effective against which critter.  
---
Toxic Valley is doable at about L15, but parts may be tough.
---
Western side of the savage divide after L20.  
---
Ash heap @30.
---
Points west after 35.
---
Most, but not all, higher level people will help you.  
---
Is that official from Bethesda?
---
I remember seeing early promotions about it saying it ends on March 26 @ 6 am EDT. 
---
Well there were several posts the last couple of months about it, people are worried but in the end it doesn't matter.  
---
Would i love a new fresh start in survival mode? yes, but i guess beth not so....
---
I assure you they dont reload faster.
---
Staggering is one way, but you can also irradiate them, stealth boy frenzy them and other techniques.
---
Never tried, but I would think pa helm would just made you red(can pop a berry mentat and make the enemy glow pink anyways) and the recon scoop would just put a diamond on you, same thing as the red marker thats on you anyways(i assume lol we'd have to test it). 
---
So people are "abusing" Assassin/Sentinel, but doing 6000 damage in 1 hit with a fast bloodied melee build is ok?  
---
Fallout is not a simulator.
---
 Wonder what this does to team play....
---
&gt;Friends who are currently in Survival Mode worlds now display a campfire icon next to their names in the Social Menu. 
---
And how it will effect those who are not on Survival Mode vs. Adventure Mode?  Will the entire team be wanted when a teammate in Survival Mode kills someone also in Survival Mode, does that make the entire team wanted?   As I keep thinking of this I see some great ambushes coming into play!!
---
Lol why not??  Its not broken ppl jus dint like how it works and complain..
---
your argument has already been countered, which is what I said. You want me to repeat it all here for you?   Upvotes might be a metric for popularity, but not validity. Also, you need better insults. 
---
It wouldn't make anything fairer, those that spent hundreds of hours grinding would get shafted and quit or just grind more than you anyways.
---
You can't stop or gate people from grinding.
---
And let's be honest. No one wants to PvP with pipe pistols anyway. 
---
Thanks a lot this is very useful  I just started a melee build and it‚Äôs good xp farming
---
Best. Comment. Ever.
---
Well no, cause if you are level 200 like i am and you die u lose 400 caps. So i am not sure it there will be anyone over level 50 haha
---
&gt;Weapon damage during PVP combat has received overarching adjustments to help a wide variety of weapons feel more deadly versus other players. 
---
What does this mean?
---
That sounds glorious
---
Rifle gang downvotes you for being right.
---
While you nerds are getting jumped at whitespring I'll be cleaning up events with some piece of mind the rest of the server is busy
---
Nobody‚Äôs got them right?
---
Nah
---
Please patch in dog companions! 
---
SCRAP EVERYTHING(especially your junk every opportunity you get)
---
Hallowed are the Mothman brother.
---
Until we get ass/sent or ass/cav on power armor, it is worthless in PvP though. That, or, IMO, just nerf the hell out of those regular armor pieces. Then again I'd prefer if there were no legendaries in the game at all.
---
The balancing argument comes from the damage, range and firing speed you can get out of rifles.
---
Lol.  Judging by the 10,000 posts on this in the past two weeks, I'd say other people might possibly have spoken up with that same opinion.
---
The thing is, you have to look at it beyond just the launch IMO.  Sure, everyone would start with a level playing field.  But a week later you'd already have players who have grinded to high levels.  Two, three, four weeks later, forget it.  In six months' time, the gap would be just as big as it is now.  If you kept people from using their Adventure Mode character in Survival Mode, you'd be adding an inconvenience for the entire lifespan of the game just to make things different for a couple of weeks.
---
It's actually a genius way to put PVP aside, and collectively gain xp at higher rates. 
---
LOVE IT! Can't wait to get home and play. 
---
Only thing I'd like to see changed in the future (for Survival Mode) is an easier way to find players or have them show up on the map. The mode is supposed to be about PVP, and without being able to see others on the map, it greatly reduced the chance of ever finding anyone. If I didn't have the map, I could go days without actually running into another player naturally. Please consider this tweak to increase the bloodshed!
---
Thanks Beth!
---
Those results support the rumor that I‚Äôd heard that two-shot on Launchers only affects the direct-impact portion; the explosion portion is completely normal, and since that‚Äôs the vast majority of the damage, they are effectively doing double damage. Good to know indeed!
---
Every single time I take a workshop I get 1-shotted by people abusing the contesting exploit. I'm at the point where I won't touch them unless it is for a challenge, and I'll server hop right after so I can't get murdered.
---
Anytime üëç
---
Does the door open/close from both sides? I tried using one and it was a pain in the butt to get it to open from inside or outside the garage doorüòÖ
---
There‚Äôs been a claim of someone getting an old man winter mask, but whether that was from the quest or not is hard to say.
---
I don't think anyone has them yet, either due to a bug or maybe the event will be on again in a few weeks or so and different masks will be given as rewards.
---
You'll have to compete with every player on Xbox hounding the ONE person who may have gotten it during the 7 day event.  Your other masks are relatively worthless though right now, since the grinding people did attempting to get the rares have created a TON of those.  Until the event gets a bit older, the supply exceeds the demand.
---
Idk but I‚Äôve seen people with them
---
&gt;I honestly just wish there were more skins/paints available in-game.
---
Seriously, this would be the easiest way for Bethesda to get people to use and buy Atoms. People want to customize their weapons. People love skins, but Bethesda releases them so slowly.
---
**HALLOWED ARE THE MOTHMEN**
---
A bold move. If there are legitimate masks, you'll have a hard time buying them for Caps. You're looking at IRL$¬£ or at least minor internal organ
---
yea, biv is hilarious, and it's fun once and a while, but having to make and drink 10+ different drinks every day is a pita, and takes up the little bit of play time i have in a day.
---
&gt;I seriously don't understand all this wanting clean weapons and clothes lark.
---
Paint still exists in the game (it's a great source of lead, too). You could just paint a weapon any color you wanted even in a post apocalyptic world. Not everything has to look weathered and worn.
---
West Virginia wasn't hit by bombs, just radiation, the Scorched, and time. There's little reason for the area to be as worn down as it is at times. Even nature wouldn't be that destructive overall.
---
First of all, congratulations on turning your life around.  I have a friend in the program and it has meant the world to him.  
---
I attended his 1 year and listened to him share his story and I'm so proud of him, while at the same time I'm dumbfounded at what he put himself through.  
---
Next, drug and alcohol use have had a fairly large presence in all the Fallout games, going back to Fallout 1 in 1997.  So, this isn't a new thing.  
---
I can relate to this theme being difficult for you.  My father passed away unexpectedly last year and much of the environmental storytelling in Fallout76 has been quite difficult for me.
---
Lastly, the etymology of the phrase "rock bottom" dates back to the 1800s; well before the AA was founded in 1935.  
---
If you really need a workshop but don't want to pvp, wait until the server has extended is's "death time", where the server stops sending people into the map, to shut the map down. You will end up alone in the map after a while. This may take some hours to do, though. 
---
If you used skill to get there or intelligently built your character than yes.
---
Ah yes good ol radiation! Forgot about that. Can you enlighten me on what a stealth boy frenzy is?  
---
This exploit has completely stopped me from using workshops. At very high levels this happens to me within minutes of taking a workshop.
---
Repeatable glitch if you equip the same mask twice (different copies) and then another different one and remove it.
---
You're not far off. I have 2 mint condition hips for Trade (some minor wear and tear).
---
&gt;	Once they remove camp damage too, I'll be happy.
---
That‚Äôs not in this one? Damn, I guess my decon shower stays in storage. 
---
Or food. Cause I don't really want to carry it. Just top up.
---
who wants a second left nut?
---
Nothing stood in my way that day. If the first shot didn't kill it, the one half a second later did.
---
Giving melee **yet another** advantage over rifles.
---
 How many shots can I fire with a Lever action with a 5 fire rate before some tool in cav armor with a machete can close the distance?
---
How many shots can a sniper rifle, with a fire rate of **3** get off before the marsupial hopping jackass with the duped 40% swing speed deathclaw guantlet gets to them?
---
2-8hours
---
Soon \^TM
---
Given the rarity I‚Äôll put it at 5 k minimum price given two different options.
---
Somebody willing to sell 
---
Somebody act√∫ally getting a legit one , and wanting to sell lol 
---
You can let 1 out of 100 people have an item and have it still be rare. Having 2 or 3 possibly out of 500000 is just punishing to a playerbase that was hyped up and specifically advertised ten masks. Having HALF the rewards for a week long event unobtainable is not rate
---
This would effectively make it deathmatch mode.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Hm. Well I'm about 10 hours away, 647 miles. Actually a lot closer than I thought.
---
Feels Michigan Man.
---
Jokes aside though, I kinda wanna see visit Virginia, it just seems cozy.
---
My to-go workshop blueprint is a one-floor-tile shack with everything in it:
---
- Radio
---
- cooking ‚Äòstation‚Äô
---
- bed
---
- stash
---
- piano
---
- lights
---
- workbench for scrapping
---
Was pretty challenging to make everything fit in *and* be accessible, but the end product turned out pretty cute. It doesn‚Äôt have a bar like yours though!
---
Sentinel is a minor modifier though.  I'm talking about the major one.
---
It's true what you say about flat damage reduction, but only if you know what you're going up against.  Sometimes that's predictable (Silos and robots, Whitesprings and ghouls, West-Tek and Super Mutants), but most of the time it's not.  And if you're mismatched, you have "ordinary" defense.  At least with Unyielding, you have an across-the-board bonus no matter what you're facing.  And especially if you're melee and stacking with Radicool, that significant STR bonus gets into the whole question of whether simply being able to kill things faster is just as good as the damage mitigation of Troubleshooters/Ghoul Slayers/etc.
---
There is, of course, nothing that compared to Sentinel.
---
My personal theory? Most people will congregate around the top 3 of the leaderboards slightly eliminating this issue
---
Hell no. 
---
Wrong, it‚Äôs not supposed to be just about pvp. It‚Äôs supposed to be Survival.
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be a mode where people jump around fast travelling on the map to each other doing pvp. 
---
Prob. Dev room lots of people have stuff from this place and a great way to say you got it hahaha
---
Downloading my 3.7Gb present right now.
---
XB1
---
I wish this got more attention from Bethesda. High level players are now completely cut off from using workshops because of these exploits.
---
I would love to team up with a few honest and strategic guys on survival.
---
That's why you stagger them first, then VATS crit
---
Im hoping later we can dual wield certain weapons. knives for one,  but my sniper outfit clad starlet really needs to dual pistols!
---
happy cake day!
---
I assume he's talking about targeting someone for hacking their account.
---
Duping shattered the economy/PvP balance pretty much permanently. So yes, it's a bit of a mistake to allow people to take their TSE/Sentinal gear into Survival.
---
On the other hand, they'd have to do a lot of work/server fuckery to completely separate Survival/Adventure completely. That leaves them with two options: 
---
1) Create a completely parallel storage/server infrastructure for the two modes, with all the associated complexities and problems that would come from that
---
2) Universal character wipe.
---
So yes and no. Duping and exploits ruined everything, but forcing new characters (and cutting off the option of someone just using Adventure Mules to bring over their dupe god-tiers by logging into adventure with a new character) is way more trouble than its worth. 
---
Top 3 players will always be on the map, go after them!
---
Usually 3 hrs from when it was taken offline
---
Oh no no no, I was just joking about possibilities. Sorry if that came off as sounding like actual plans. 
---
This would happen even if people had to start new chars. The people starting today would have the same advantage over the people who start in a month, for example. Somebody is always going to be the victim.
---
I want a Nuka-cola pip-boy.

Just server hop whitespring golf club and clear out the ghouls. Tons of xp and you get loads of 1* legendaries that will come in handy at a low level. Be careful doing it though, because if there are higher levels there when you spawn in the ghouls will be high level too.
---
It takes time. that's what it takes. your welcome for letting you know.

**COMMIE DETECTED**
---
Yup. Half these people didn't read any of the patch notes or details and definitely didn't put any thought into it lol
---
Only 20 hours for me
---
So the only incentive to play survival is to play RUST : Fallout 76 edition, and to get some legendary weapons from some dailies.
---
Oh norincos were banned for import into the USA a long time ago. They‚Äôre relatively scarce which drives up the demand.
---
I don‚Äôt even know who that is. All I know is I want a flaming chainsaw and gas mask 
---
Can you even sell it?  I didn‚Äôt think you could trade quest related items.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much a pick up BR. Survive when you have time. The legendary item are cool but I‚Äôm pretty such you could get them in normal mode.  
---
I may have missed something,but what is it you can't do now in Adventure mode besides kill someone with pure, rapid fire slap damage? Workshops and returning fire can still get you flagged as hostile can't they?
---
Curious if the damage nerf will make glass cannon classes weaker now that other builds will not die in one hit and are able to get their hits in
---
I'm concerned about the bunker/glitch bases 
---
Not really.  Just that slap damage is now zero.
---
i got the same plans multiple times, while not getting over half of them :(
---
What difference does it make? All of the legendary weapons and armor are selling online for $15-$30.
---
There is an army if trolls scavenging every server to remove the best stuff from the game economy.
---
So a newb in survival can just buy the stuff immediately.
---
What difference does it make?
---
I think its a pretty cool system thats gonna lead to some positive player interaction and maybe some gun slinging. I really wish the servers had more players though, the wasteland gets lonely with just 24. 
---
Looks awesome with longshoreman's outfit üòä
---
If you consider having a "medal" a reward then sure lol.  
---
Yes. I needed this yesterday. I died during the Swarm of Suitors event and another player was present. I had a bunch of junk on me and wanted to get back to it before he did.
---
When I spawned in, he was standing over the area of my bag and gave me the "thumbs up", I thought sarcastically, like "thanks for the stuff!". So I thumbs downed him and started walking away.
---
Then I saw the map marker to retrieve my stuff was still there. Went back and found the bag under some environmental stuff. So I had to throw back my own thumbs up and a heart.
---
He did get it and gave me a thumbs up back, but it would be much easier to have a "sorry" style thing.
---
Name checks out.
---
Is there any update on this? My base was destroyed a month back and I had just used all my wood and steel to fix it up and not even 30 minutes later some asshole destroyed it so I ended up taking a deep breath and leaving the game for the time being. Thinking of going back if that's going to be added soon. 
---
I don't even get excited for these anymore considering there's still a bunch from the FIRST datamine that hasn't been released. :'(
---
Stations would HAVE to be limited to one's friends lists. The potential for something like this to go bad is incredibly high.
---
Most of the 100% successful runs that didn't get anything, at least a portion of which admitted they had little involvement. (Ie, showed up after initial start of event to talk to the handy parade host and/or didn't get any kills in the event or personally complete any of the protectron tasks personally) so they simply may have not been counted as "in" event. 
---
But there's been quite a few people showing off various masks they've supposedly gotten through competition of the event so I think it's just dismissive to assume that every single one of the people proving they have the mask had to have gotten them through cheating or exploits. 
---
To me this is people just not understanding when they said rare they actually meant rare, not kinda difficult or a bit grindy, but actually rare. 
---
To me this seems pretty standard for rare loot tables on Bethesda games and is no different than getting a preserved pie from the machine except that more people wanted this and feel entitled to getting it for whatever reason just because they want it.  There's no public outcry over the difficulty level on the pie or even things like the neon letters or small letters or hunters coat in loot tables, plenty of rare items exist in the game as standard on the same level of difficulty without it being declared a technical problem. 
---
I think the community has been more than vocal enough about being unhappy and claiming the missions were broken that at least one developer would have bothered to check the code and determine if indeed it was broken and if so then I'm sure Bethesda after all the pr nightmares they've been through would have done a hot fix and maybe even offered one of the rare masks free to accommodate. That never happened. So I'm assuming that Bethesda has seen the real numbers and probably will release them and show, hey out of the million plus times people played we gave out such and such number of these rare masks. I genuinely think it's kinda insane to assume conspiracy theories over factual evidence on this no matter how much someone feels they are deserving of something for whatever weird self entitled reason. 
---
If you need further example in game of rare tables, go do a preserved pie run, see how many times you have to do it before you get a piece. For many people the number was into the many hundreds if not thousands, even with high luck. 
---
Taking that into account on top of the fact that almost every run through of the missions, people insisted on trying to keep every single robot alive in order to get the 100% chance of drop, even though it was made incredibly clear by devs that at least some of the masks would only drop under certain variables of numbers. So if, for example, the jester mask had a 1% drop rate only in cases where 3/5 protectrons were alive at completion, how many run throughs did people do that actually experiment with those variables, or just wanted to get 100% chance of getting a drop but then got upset when all drops were standard even though it was clearly stated going into it that experiment was necessary to get rare. To me that seems like people just didn't listen and wanted what they wanted without doing as told. 
---
From Bethesda‚Äôs patch mgmt
---
‚ÄúSLAP‚Äù DAMAGE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM ADVENTURE MODE
---
I no longer have to worry about preemptively banning highbies near me while playing. üëç
---
U are never gonna se me coming with my chamelon perk :)
---
If they did it regurarly, as a seasonl thing it would be cool and fair. If it would only be done once then it would postpone the current issues further in time, and take away regular players means of participating in top tier PvP.
---
Precisely why I'm starting a new character for survival only.
---
 Well Bethesda evidently felt that the current state of PVP was not acceptable because they changed it. 
---
From today's patch notes: 
---
***PVP Combat and Balance***
---
*Weapon damage during PVP combat has received overarching adjustments to help a wide variety of weapons feel more deadly versus other players.*
---
*This also limits the amount of health players can lose in a single hit during PVP combat, which will greatly reduce the likelihood of one-shot kills.*
---
*These adjustments have been applied to PVP Combat in Survival Mode, as well.*
---
The fact that they are already making changes to PVP suggests that they already know that something's wrong. I highly doubt that these are the last changes that we will see to PVP.
---
Getting this account lacks the required entitlements normally means servers are back up just waiting on them enabling login for users so soon most likely 
---
Worth it? 
---
where is muh .50 cal machine gun skins?
---
&gt;!harpoon gun too pls!&lt;
---
playing the harp in a mr fuzzy mask makes it look like youre picking your teeth
---
I loved all the different radio options from mods in Fallout 4. I miss my 80s jams. 
---
I bet it's a combat knife
---
That‚Äôs kind of my point. Was the idea to just give us a trophy? Lol
---
As long as the workshop loophole exists, griefers will avoid survival mode and pick on casuals in adventure mode because they can't compete with real PvP'ers and they enjoy bullying other players. Workshop PvP should be restricted to the workshop area, as many people have suggested.
---
Unless you take a workshop. If you own a workshop, be prepared to get farmed with the contesting exploit if you are over level 50.
---
Still cheaper than an original russian 
---
How so?
---
Here's what I am wondering.  We know that fast travel will be severely limited in Survival.  But will the two different mode retain different log off points?  Let's say I'm in Survival mode and I log off while I'm in Watoga.  When I load up Adventure mode, would I still be in Watoga or would I be in the location I was when I last played adventure mode?
---
I have the camo hunting rifle skin and it looks awesome, have matching t51b power armour too lol.
---
nice!  more photos to take 
---
In summer, during Nuclear Winter. Right now we're still in Wild Appalachia.
---
Agreed!
---
It's the theme for my main character. 
---
A couple armor skins isn't cutting it anymore. 
---
Finally someone that gets it!!!!!!
---
I don't quite understand the reason behind that mechanic either.  Maybe the idea is to prevent an OP player from dominating the map, but at the same time, it exposes players who might largely be minding their own business to those same players.
---
Gloomy?
---
I would be opening a podcast at the Harper‚Äôs Ferry Recording Studio.
---
This concept is too simple,  MAKE THIS HAPPEN BETHESDA
---
Free for all
---
The good thing is that the community haven't learned TSE and sentinel are not the best possible gear when the duping was common. Economy ain't permanently shattered and is still evolving.
---
Rifle perks have a whopping 9% stagger chance. If I have to lob a grenade, or run up and bash them, it kind of invalidates the whole "sniper" thing.
---
Me and my friend have a bet. If a group called the tunnel snakes does not emerge within the first 2 weeks of survival mode I have to give him 1000 caps and a marsupial mutation serum. If one does then I get 1000 caps and speed demon.
---
Rare has done time limited items pretty well, Bethesda should learn from them next time.
---
Tried this a couple of times on XBOX and when I got disconnected, it pulled us both out of the server.  Now I snap a pix on my cell phone right before I launch.  If I get disconnected, I look up someones profile and join back.  Only works if they are  displaying ONLINE status and they have their profile configured so anyone can see it.  Works pretty well for me when I've needed it.
---
If you have pacifist on, i cannot harm you. 
---
Yes, workshops are the only avenue now. Which we did use. But it was one of 3 ways. 
---
We would have an "opening" quest. Prove your strength. Claim the nearby workshop for our kingdom. Once you prove your worth, you may meet our king &amp; earn thenl trust of the kingdom. 
---
We would send people on that quest first.. In order to be able to "tag" their work shop in subsequentll quests. 
---
Other ways of initiating "hostile" have all been removed. 
---
They arent unique sadly. Your best bet to collect those is try to do nuke runs after most people have started to leave. Initially you wont get much if your battling ten other people for them. Weapons however are unique to each player. 
---
If you need flux it's best to do a couple of white springs runs first, forget the flux, just stock up on those items for 2 or 3 runs. Then next nuke do your flux run. Use bountiful harvest to get 2 for each pick and super duper when you craft. 
---
I have no doubt that one will, but I suppose it depends on what "emerge" means. I mean, you and I could start a "group" right now and call ourselves the Tunnel Snakes and technically you win. How are you measuring success?
---
If you are a new fallout player please don't start with this game. This is not what fallout is. I love 76 but it's not a good first experience  to the fallout world. Start with 3 or new vegas. This game has no npcs worth talking about while in say new vegas every npc has a story and a purpose that makes you love the world, this game is more for people whom already love fallout and want  a experience with other people but it's not a real fallout. It's a MMO based on fallout. 
---
I'll be killing everyone I see. GTFO of my nuked Whitesprings, I've got EXP to farm.
---
ah in om ps4, but thank you anyway, it is still appreciated
---
I've been getting screwed recently at the tech data grind.  It seems I only get like a handful of bullets and some purified water as a reward.
---
Damn someone's vagina is sore
---
Most likely like the Justice League. No leader. Just a council of founding members.
---
Camoflauge camps built into unmarked named locations will be the way to go
---
And good luck to you. I hope you find someone willing to sell you the recipes for a low price.
---
Or just transfer your caps to a friend / alt. My level 315 won't be worth anything.
---
Primarily I use a lever-action because people run stuff like dodgy and serendipity and you have to count on single shots not getting the job done. I only pull out the VATS crit Bloodied Dragon when someone is abusing their legendary armor and can't be killed otherwise. Tell me, how many times have YOU killed someone running a full set of Assassin/Sent WITHOUT one-shotting them? A staggering shotgun build is one of the few things I know of that can somewhat reliably do it without needing to crit them for a one-shot. And if you don't kill them in a single hit, the clown is just going to start hammering his stimpak hotkey and you are right back to square 1, unable to kill the guy who can just stand there and pour fire back on you. And the Assassin/Senters still had the option to crouch, use chameleon or a stealth boy, which negated your VATS ability anyway. You had to stalk and catch them standing up. And anyone who wasn't wearing that armor didn't NEED to be VATS crit one-shot to be dealt with because you could get the job done without VATS in a couple shots anyway. I think the people whining about getting sniped were people that were used to being invulnerable in their rare armor, and got pissed when people figured out how to deal with them. I never had that problem. It happened to me occasionally when I made a mistake, but I never got salty about it. 
---
If you can‚Äôt imagine how this would go bad then you don‚Äôt know the internet very well
---
Those idiots
---
Wow harsh I was just asking a simple question cause I honestly don't know.
---
Bloodied or berserker build? Glass canon builds, low damage tolerance but high damage output.
---
That makes sense, I thought they were including PvP challenges so I was under the impression they were trying to lean into it in Survival.
---
I guess they didn't really thought about that xD  
---
I just want the option to play fresh in survival with other new characters. This is our best shot at it until private servers are a thing, quite a bummer. 
---
Survival mode is a completely different experience if everything every player has was gotten under those survival conditions. The value of everything is greatly increased. I hope they reconsider.
---
Really?
---
Some dude, who's mom told him he's funny, sets up a radio station of 14 year old racist "humour"? 
---
Some other player, handing out spoilers. 
---
There's so much potential for abuse.
---
Set up a private in-game chat and have your buddy play music in the background if it matters to you. Presto... pirate radio in the wasteland.
---
But then I'll be one step closer to those sweet sweet rewards
---
How do workshops work? Do you spend your own materials to build there? or is it from the workshop itself?
---
It could be like a server wide chat, one person with input and anybody who listenes with output.  I don't understand anything about programming, but would that be too hard?
---
I'm in the camp of something wrong with the drop rate.
---
I tried everything to attempt getting a rare drop mask.
---
Tried different configurations in the decorating section, doing the robots in a particular order, letting some robots die, tried to make sure no robot was damaged, looked around the area to see if there was a hidden terminal somewhere like at the screaming cabin.
---
I even tried hacking the robots with the robotic expert perk.
---
No rare mask dropped and I must have done the event about 60+ times 
---
Okay thanks man
---
I don't speak for everyone obviously, but I didn't want to see existing characters in survival because so many people have duped weapons. I don't care about people being strong in the mode, I just care about the byproduct of months of exploiting being in the mode. 
---
TSE are way too abundant and I was hoping we would see the end of that 
---
Nuke charleston and make sure to cover the buildings as inside they spawn glowing ghouls -  profit. 
---
In a month or two, any new players would be joining in against level 100 survival vets anyway. Doesn't make a difference as time goes on. 
---
I have 750h logged. How many have you. Fanboys are so funny. 
---
None of us know
---
Third time's the charm.
---
I kinda agree with this. For me, as a primary PvE player who enjoys occasional PvP, where's my incentive to play on survival? Double the number of legendary 3 star enemies or something, then I'll gladly play it and deal with PvP deaths.
---
Why delete and repost?
---
I guess they didn't load in yet lol. I will thanks
---
I‚Äôll have some also if you don‚Äôt mind
---
Damn
---
Theres potential for abuse ajywhere and there's the option to not listen to that abuse anywhere you go on the internet
---
Change the station
---
Yeah, that's a good idea.  Flux is not a problem so you are right - it would probably be better to gather mass &amp; HRF since they don't spoil.  I do use the perk card when harvesting, though - would be silly not to :)
---
Kinda stupid that they aren't unique, though.
---
There is a lot more to the reward system than just caps. And if your friend is 350 and still doesn‚Äôt have a build to kill anyone, he should definitely not start playing again.  
---
There is a YouTuber called SkoolZoned. He has a few FO76 videos and tons of FO4 videos. It's a great resource.
---
hopefully it will be back in your inventory after the patch is over and you can log back in
---
This is awesome. Thanks for sharing it. 
---
The game developers did a great job with this. 
---
&gt; it would freshen the game up a bit and make firefights fairer
---
Per the patch notes, "Weapon damage during PVP combat has received overarching adjustments to help a wide variety of weapons feel more deadly versus other players. This also limits the amount of health players can lose in a single hit during PVP combat, which will greatly reduce the likelihood of one-shot kills."
---
"Reasons why it's bad even though none of us have played it yet" 
---
FTFY
---
Ah, the legendary Nuka Man. OMG they need the nuka cola guns. Running around in nuka cola armor killing with nuka guns.
---
This has to happen!
---
Hotkey radx instead
---
Best case scenario for me is that Survival starts going into 1-3 month "seasons" eventually with fresh starts and new characters every time and no migration. 
---
Maybe in the future, or else they would have said something about it.
---
When will they be back up
---
The rare masks either weren't dropping at all or had a drop rate that was so low it was equivalent to having a drop rate of zero given the limited nature of the event.
---
You mean like the green stickied post on the front page?

---
Duping is not dead. Its alive and well and staying under the radar. Trust me.
---
I have no doubt rare masks will become more common in the next couple weeks to a month.
---
If we see anyone on reddit or discord talking about starting a group called the tunnel snakes then I win. I can't start a group or influence an unnamed group to call themselves the tunnel snakes.
---
All signs point to yes
---
It would be even better if in survival it didn't show where the nuke was going to drop until it did 
---
Good to know haha
---
Griefing shouldnt be that much of a problem considering that you can change the radio station
---
Yes! Okay got it. Thank you 
---
Hey Matt, Names Alex and I just recently relapsed I guess
---
Was clean from Christmas until now, just couldn't shake the thought of purge server shenanigans so here we are I guess
---
Bethesda just dropped my hit off, but they're saying I can't fire it up just yet.
---
Confused and cold, we wait
---
I woke up in the night wondering if I could have gotten one of the rare masks just by killing one of the robots that was wearing one. 
---
I wanted the jester. 
---
but they have done hot fixes before I'm confused
---
We've been playing the game for months. You know survival mode is the same game right? With the exception of full PVP. Patch notes just landed so unless you know something I don't...?
---
I have been waiting since January to get back into the game and had my hype going on for survival.
---
I even thought they‚Äôd reconsider, as they mentioned this would be the case and they got huge backlash due to it.
---
It‚Äôs just sad, I was hoping they‚Äôd make something cool out of it,  not just a deathmatch.
---
As a level 180+ now i will lose 360+ caps, well no thanks xD
---
At some point between now and the next server maintenance. 
---
We never know. Just whenever it‚Äôs done. 
---
Damn you people are fast.
---
The red enamel stove was already for sale in the shop too since last week.
---
Pro Tip that probably will get buried anyways:
---
You can go to the Bethesda website, scroll to the bottom and open a ticket to change your Bethesda username
---
Not likely to happen.  Fermenter appears to be running on the Stash-tied system they are going to use for Display purposes.  Most likely reason it's you only and only in your CAMP, not Workshop.
---
I don't see that changing any time soon, as they expand this system to other CAMP items for Display purposes, and (I'm guessing) the possible future cooler system.
---
I did not know that. thank you!
---
Not quite. As /u/FritoZanzibar [pointed out in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5qbmc/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_notes_march_26/ejf649z/), contesting a Workshop on a team can allow one player to stay at the Workshop while their teammate tracks down and kills the Workshop owner.
---
Second, they didn't mention anything about players being unable to damage your CAMPs and such, which is another route people can take to force PvP against a specific player (unless I've missed something).
---
Seems like a bandaid on a gunshot wound. 
---
When they have finished updating the server side normally takes around 3 hours has only been 2 so far.
---
Am I the only one that can't sign in after this update? I keep getting a 4:8:2006 error message
---
Also.if you need big hauls of flux use good with salt. It slows decay and makes a huge difference. 
---
Also little tip. If your flux is about to go bad while harvesting, drop.it in a baggie. But only if you can immediately pick up a new flux of the same type. Harvest the new one at full condition, then pick back up the decaying ones in the bag and they all will be at full condition. 
---
Nobody knows
---
Could be up in a few minutes or a few hours. 
---
If you dont agree with this feature you simply dont have to use it.  There would be nothing forcing you, I just know a large portion of the community would enjoy this.
---
Run around with no caps, with a one shot weapon. Even with the debuff my Dragon does about 700 damage, ignoring most of armor. 
---
But yeah, cap payoffs should be based on stuff like, how long a battle lasted, or how many shots were exchanged, rather than levels.
---
I'd be down for a Responder's Survival Team! 
---
Because it's not like we have a shortage of issues that affect *both* modes...
---
I still find it weird that a max level character can just jump right in and potentially start griefing players who start on survival. All I‚Äôm saying is having it setup like this could escalate griefing. Although allowing the grieved the freedom to go back to Adventure mode I guess balances it out, doesn‚Äôt change how weird it feels to me though.
---
Well it is called Survival beta. Maybe we can hope once they test and balance the mode they exit beta and make everyone start clean.
---
*sigh* I give up. I already carry cryo grenades. Pretty sure grenades, and cryolators don't have the 180+ range my rifles do, though.
---
And stealth boys works just as well for our targets. Now that they're immune to vats crit kills, they can pop a stealth boy after the first shot, while we're still reloading, and bounce away. Or bounce at us and melee us to death, with or without vats.
---
Or how about, "I have stiff for you that i'm trying to drop in front of you, newbie, so stand still."
---
Then you get debuff -50% damage to players for few hours.
---
But again this is speculation on your part. It would be nice if they could speculate why this mode is listed as a beta. Although I will say that it‚Äôs much easier to do it this way and switch to survival mode only characters rather than the other way around
---
I never even realized they were down, other than this morning for weekly maintenance + patch? I played every night for the past 2 weeks no issues on PC. Was it console only?
---
Thanks for letting me know 
---
Join up with us, both above level 100. We can try to help, psn PrimordialPear
---
Or fast travel to train stations free, so more people would just travel there .
---
Just let us throw the Canadian flag up
---
Literally the exact same thing
---
&gt; Returning fire does not flag hostile if you have pacifist on. 
---
This part is where I'm having trouble. The patch notes just say the following:
---
&gt;Returning fire against another player will still mark you as hostile toward them and will cause you to take full damage from their attacks.
---
It doesn't say anything about pacifist mode needing to be off for the returning fire portion, unless that's been clarified elsewhere and I missed it.  Which is totally possible :)    
---
It's not anyone in particular's protocols, it's industry best practice.
---
While there may be some 'really easy, just fix it' changes, it's not always easy to be sure that's the case.  Many times a small change effects other 'unrelated' things (remove slap damage by turning off friendly fire seems easy...but what about secondary damage, how does the game see that?  Does the game differentiate player-initiated car explosions from mob-initiated ones?  What abut splash damage?  Is reflected damage considered player or opponent initiated? Etc. etc. etc.)
---
Plus, almost all server changes will necessitate a client side change. Aside from bug testing *that* aspect, for several different platforms on countless hardware/software configurations, especially if anything remotely affecting graphics display.  Plus, for some instances, you have to deal with deploying those change through a 3rd party system (XBox/PS particularly), which adds another level of documentation complexity, as well as scheduling restrictions that can be placed (not sure about that whole infrastructure myself, just things I've heard).
---
A great example of all that is in WoW.  Since it's release in 2004, your character starts out with a 16 slot backpack (your 'inventory').  Later on, once storage became more of an issue, the idea was floated to increase or allow the expansion of that original bag slot.  Just change the graphic and edit the 16 to 32, right?  15 years later, they still haven't figured out a way to do it...it's too ingrained in the code at this point, too much work for such a 'small change'.
---
&gt; And I thought they already said that the CAMP will be now undamageable?
---
I don't remember that, but I mean that as in I actually don't remember if that is or isn't the case. Was that last patch?
---
Aww, don't give up hun
---
It's patch day and the servers are still down. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
I just want the option to play a survival only character with other survival only characters, it would be such a unique and amazing experience to have to earn everything you have in survival. 
---
Let current characters play it too, but at least give us the option to segment ourselves optionally! 
---
Every item in the game has so much more value when it has to be acquired under survival mode rules!
---
Not up yet
---
The servers are down 
---
OLD MAN WINTER MEETS HIS MATCH. LITERALLY. IT'S A BONFIRE. Yep I would have shelled out some green to get one of those for my CAMP
---
The game is still down for updates

Just don‚Äôt trade in survival mode..... switch to adventure for any trading, simple solution.
---
&gt;a company makes you agree to a legally rigid terms of use
---
&gt;"That's conjecture, you're just assuming they mean that"
---
My pointer would be to sort by new and find your answer in less time it took me to type this.
---
No alert to we‚Äôre it‚Äôs gonna drop only the announcement over the radio to strike fear into people‚Äôs hearts!
---
Once you get to higher levels, you will never be able to take a workshop without getting your caps farmed by this contesting exploit. It sucks because I used to love taking workshops and building them up.
---
Servers are still down for maintenance - No one knows the exact time they go back up but people are estimating within the next hour or so
---
I know there are a hundred and one other bugs that are probably more important than this, but I have to agree! Now I have to hide my little garden whenever I move camp, just so I can't look upon my field of frustration! :)
---
Now hold on pardner, don‚Äôt just be firin‚Äô all willy nilly just cuz I came out of the woods with my bloodied grognak axe still in hand, I was just cuttin‚Äô wood.
---
Got banned dude. Sorry!
---
Just kidding! Patch day!
---
When will we get CAMP stash decorating?
---
Looking forward toplaying it for the challenge. Good thing it's not for the rewards though those weekly challenge weapons are pure shit.
---
Account security.... Display names should not effect the report function in game... 
---
Trade in the regular mode.... not sure how that is a viable complaint lmfao
---
This still occurring. This happens on my suppressors handmade.
---
That's how our species nearly got wiped out by the Minbari, you know!
---
Aha yes. This is a fun mode that I wanted. Gonna make a fresh character for this one. 
---
I only wish they would require that, instead of letting you bring a level 200 dude with xo-1 PA
---
Then why don‚Äôt you just artificially restrict yourself to only fast traveling to train stations??
---
As a raider would say:  Hehehehe ha-ha-ha ha HA HA HA HA....   You hear that? It's called fear! 
---
Yeah I got the four most common masks, the donut recipe, but sadly no effigy plan, sausage recipe or beret. Hopefully they increase drop rates for future events like these. Most people don't have time to grind them hundreds of times.
---
I was at one where a higher level broke out his explosive .50 Cal. I literally had to keep stepping in his line of fire to stop him from killing the Sloth before the low levels could tag it. The legendary is just vendor trash to us, but it could have made the day of those five low level players that were there.
---
Well, all you have to do to deal with them is keep distance. I have fought a lot of melee PVP builds, and as long as I was careful to keep them away from me I could counter just fine. If they GOT to you, you were screwed. And you deserved to be because you fucked up and let the guy with the knife beat you in a gun fight. I'm cool with being wrecked by someone who was cagey enough to get close to me. I'm NOT fine with someone I can't kill AT ALL without a VATS crit or a specialty stagger build, and then having that ability to kill them hard nerfed.
---
just trade in adventure mode. As for the pvp issues, thats just how it has to be when pvp is always enabled. Avoid players you cant contest with. By playing this mode, youre acknowledging that youre willing to die in pvp occasionally.
---
I never got into building in FO4, are the mechanics and tips/tricks transferable between the two games? I never thought to look up FO4 building videos.
---
yeah i agree that is why i also said "safe-rooms"
---
Are you talking about legit game journalist or YouTubers???
---
^(it must be DUPERS!)
---
Perhaps cool alternatives could be the 20% exp buff for characters that have only played in survival mode, or some sort of flag/icon for those characters?
---
I don't think so, it's happened to a few weapons I have owned. I grabbed a ticket on Beth support, the only thing I want back is the meat hook. Wish me luck ü§û
---
When are the sheepsquatch coming?
---
Fire a warning shot into your üå≤
---
Have you done this recently? I tried it right after the game was released and it looked like they changed their policy at the same time. My displayed name is still my account id.
---
That's some bizarre discrimination.
---
As long as they also decrease the distance between camps, wastelands trailer park and club house would be brilliant. 
---
Yeah I have to wear a gas mask at all times while I‚Äôm there lol
---
We came up with an idea for a player CAMP radio station in game that would also be streamed over twitch or something. Do it Howard Stern style. I posted something about this a few months back. 
---
The music is the tough part though because of copy-write issues, but I believe we ended up coming up with a Talk Radio Show format that would also use the in-game songs in-between someone talking in character. 
---
We thought it might be cool to have a live person DJ even if it were all the same music we have been listening to, classical or otherwise. They could talk about shit going on in game, events and what not, interview other players, the weather, maybe even advertise items for sale. 
---
And since it's streamed you wouldn't actually need to have access to FO76's radio broadcast system, and anyone can listen on any server or platform. Just have to have a browser open to twitch or whatever in the background to listen while you play. This is something that some people already do, like listening to music from past Fallouts on YouTube while grinding away.
---
Unfortunately, life happened and the idea kind of fell apart. 
---
No the workshop provides you with some materials to build. At a certain point you can run out of workshop-provided materials and have to use your own
---
But why force me to play the way you want me to?
---
Why can't I have the choice to be in lore mode and explore in Adventure and then group up with my m8's and be raiders for an evening and then tomorrow I want to do more lore exploration without the worry of being shot or interrupted when I am listening to tapes?
---
Why are you trying to enforce your opinion on other players instead of letting the community figure out things for themselves?
---
No one wants to PvP with pipe pistols and boards. We want to use our armor and weapons we ground for. 
---
We want to group up with our friends and be the Brotherhood, or Enclave or Raiders or Responders.
---
Some like me want to get a group of people together to PvP in the Unstoppable costumes.
---
Why force me to park my character?
---
I wonder if this means changes to weapon damage vs players. Or changes to damage overall to make them deadlier to everything.
---
I wish they would give us another character slot. I want to start a new one for survival only, but I don't want to delete any characters.
---
&gt;The ultra-rare drops? I'm all good with them. Keep 'em as they are. 
---
I don't think they were even possible...
---
A picture or two on Twitter of a PC user wearing the Old Man Winter mask isn't proof of anything other than they may have gotten it from the Dev room.
---
I know Reddit is a small portion of the player base, but surely with the thousands of times people ran the event in total, someone would have shown a rare mask...
---
It might sound stupid but the only proof I'll accept is a video of the quest completing and showing a rare mask in the rewards 
---
I loved the event for the dialogue, the look and feel of it and the fact that loads of people would pkay through it. Made it alot of fun.
---
Its a shame people largely ignore all thr other events, sone of them would be alot more fun with others.
---
Technical is spelled wrong for the bos cache. It's kind of annoying as that's the one that is on top all the time end game. Saved favorites menu is probably still messed up too.
---
Trade with me in survival mode. Got some TSEs for you...... and candy.
---
"One does not simply start with Survival mode"
---
You see the thing is, you don't just start with Survival, you start with Adventure. It is like one is normal dungeon and other is heroic dungeons. You don't skip normal dungeon and then go and complain on how heroic dungeons has too strong monsters.
---
i have an extra unmodded meat hook on one of my characters if you cant get it back, im on ps4
---
id be happy to help ya out!  i know its not a 3* like your old one
---
And they could just pop a Stealth Boy if they REALLY wanted to kill you. At least that was expensive and rare, and so was limited by economics and scarcity. 
---
Wasn't as noticeable when they didn't bulldoze grass/weeds.  Though that made certain areas very difficult to see the plants.  Now that grass/weeds are cleared out by many more things including the plants, it makes these things very noticeable.
---
I would like the ability to place "flat land" foundations so I could build a nice flat farm area to plant things on.  The hilly side yard of my CAMP works, but looks awkward.  And makes building a fence around it for looks very difficult.  (One corner is low, about twice the height of a fence low).
---
u gonna die
---
&gt; Bounty system can be easily abused 
---
What does this mean exactly?  If I grind to reach the 25,000 cap limit, some guy makes 400 caps for killing me, then I take out a  3,000 cap bounty on him, well that's his problem. That's the chance he took when he fucked with me.   
---
Aww damn. Well then I 100% understand why people are annoyed by this. I hope they increase the drop rates for future events too. 
---
Still, a lot of respect from me to the developers for making this event happen &lt;3 
---
So it‚Äôs the same as any other survival PvP game?
---
Don‚Äôt trade in survival 
---
Of course low levels will get destroyed but that‚Äôs the risk you take playing on a PvP mode
---
Of course teaming will be strong but again that‚Äôs the risk you take when playing PvP 
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm kinda worried that survival will be filled with a bunch of antisocial shoot-first sociopaths. I‚Äôm ready to defend myself, but I‚Äôd like to see some friendly faces out there. 
---
Players on the map is the last thing I want, personally. Looking for more of a rust lite with RPG elementsüôåüèª
---
Yeah. The build budgets are much tighter in FO76. The mechanics are pretty much the same. Learning who to create certain aesthetics is a big deal. 
---
There's currently a bug that's causing the voice chat volume on PS4 to be set all the way down. Haven't seen anything mentioned but hopefully it gets looked at at some point, hard to communicate with people when nobody can hear you 
---
Me too! That was the first thing I was looking for when I turned on my pipboy light. I‚Äôm not a big fan of the green one.
---
Stop using you vamp cult dagger...maybe ?
---
I was just curious lol. I commented on the other.
---
Just for this, I'm going to shoot the first 5 friendly people I find right in the face!
---
(Not really... üòÅ)
---
I want to be Raider member.How pls?
---
Everything‚Äôs fine, but I want sheepsquatch.
---
I would kill for either dirt foundations or fences that adjusted to the ground they're on.
---
Then don‚Äôt trade in survival mode...?
---
Is there an eta on the update ? 
---
Even if they forced new characters, balance would be gone within a week when the power users vastly outclass everyone else. The current system at least let's you get a character competitive in adventure before going to survival.
---
You aren't wrong, but I think the dynamics change in 6 months time. By then only the truly dedicated survival mode players are still there, and the butt heads who just wanna hop back and forth to make people's lives miserable can't.
---
In the end, who knows. All I know is no other games allow you to hop back and forth between modes like this for pretty good reasons. So we'll have to see how this turns out. 
---
I don't see any problem BUT duped items, a level 200 is as dangerous as a lvl 60 with the same perk cards. Maybe use adventure mode to gear up and then go to survival mode ?
---
Remember it's only BETA.
---
Are the servers up for PSN?  I completed the download and installed and now every time it tells me my account lacks the credentials to login.
---
...and good riddance (and Happy Faschnacht) to one less Raider in this world.  Hope the door doesn't slap him in the ass on his way out.  
---
Your current ‚Äúforever home‚Äù is going to travel with you to survival mode. Are you going to dismantle it and reassemble it every time you change modes? 
---
1. Why would you want to trade in survival? It's like asking for trouble.
---
2. It's the same in every game. Even if everyone starts from 0, some people have more free time than others.
---
3. They can't see your map marker, so good luck finding a specific person on that map. WV is pretty big.
---
4. Sooo let's make it so everyone has the same perks? I don't get your point. In every MMO game players get to chose which class to play. Some are stronger than others vs specific classes. It's a game of rock paper scissors.
---
5. So? I'm a solo player, this doesn't mean nobody is allowed to play in groups because i'm an antisocial fuck.
---
6. How?
---
7. Point #1 again. Why the hell would any sane person trade in survival? 
---
I would suggest making a very simple set of blueprints which suit your particular needs that you can deploy as and when they are required and put back into storage once they no longer are.
---
It has worked well for me in adventure mode once I found out that getting my CAMP levelled was a preventable source of frustration.
---
It is actually I agree but I have subtitles on so I catch everything anyway. I‚Äôve caught a few things on the subs that I would have missed without hearing it properly, like how the scorched actually say things and any of the animals you hit with the vox syringer
---
I have an opinion that it people are more willing to feel out one another then tension will increase and help keep the game exciting.
---
The only plans I'm missing are the winter ribbons and the pole lantern. I have every other plan and at least one spare to sell later. 
---
Patch notes say if you holster your weapon an orange tag with your name will appear above your head if you have your weapon drawn a red marker will appear above your head best way to show your intentions
---
I'm glad I haven't bought them then, upon reading this. 
---
Forcing everyone to restart is just a huge inconvenience, and won't solve the issues long term when everyone eventually gets their legendary gear again. 
---
Also, 20% xp and the legendaries you get from playing this mode means that you will get more from playing this mode, period. Yes, there is a higher risk, but that's the compensation, and an all survival character will be more powerful than an all adventure character in the long run.
---
Other games make it so there is a timer before you log off.
---
You enter the settings, and there would be a ten second timer before you log off.
---
Hell even 5 seconds would work.
---
No. But at 4GB, it‚Äôs a hefty DL.
---
Wondering if all the haters who left, are gonna be ON THAT SERVER.. 
---
I really appreciate your generosity ty! my brother said he will give me he's 1* bloodied for the time being. Also I'm on PC lol
---
Part of why I don't buy the "more important" argument is that a simple sinking into the ground adjustment would fix it. You have to weigh dev time to user improvement and this would make everyone's immersion way better for little outlay of time.
---
This sounds filthy!
---
These builds imply balancing one set of stats or perks for another to achieve a specific play style, rather than difficulty. It is not "difficult" to utterly annihilate most routine creatures in 1 or two hits as this build would suggest. 
---
So changing the build doesn't change the difficulty, really. It changes the style you have to use to play the game. If you play correctly with such a build, you could be just a dominant. If you play foolishly, then yes, I could see how your suggestion would work.
---
But telling someone to play the game foolishly is obviously not your intent, I realize, so I'm not really sure what you're getting at. Playing the game "differently" isn't necessarily difficult if you happen to be good at it. And could ruin the game for you if you don't enjoy that play style in the build. 
---
Yup. Cant return fire with pacifism on.  So in would need to ask questers to turn it off. Lame. 
---
I cant get a bounty on a sever full of pacifists when pacifism extends to CAMPS. 
---
Getting a bounty was a part of our quests. You literally wont be able to get one in Adventure mode...
---
" But why force me to play the way you want me to?
---
Why can't I have the choice to be in lore mode and explore in Adventure and then group up with my m8's and be raiders for an evening and then tomorrow I want to do more lore exploration without the worry of being shot or interrupted when I am listening to tapes?"
---
You can play the game how you want - Nothing I have stated would change that so I don't know where you're coming from? 
---
"  Why are you trying to enforce your opinion on other players instead of letting the community figure out things for themselves? "
---
You just tried to make an argument and contradicted yourself. We are the community and we are figuring it out hence why we are here.
---
" No one wants to PvP with pipe pistols and boards. We want to use our armor and weapons we ground for. "
---
Again how does anything I've said impact this?
---
" We want to group up with our friends and be the Brotherhood, or Enclave or Raiders or Responders. "  
---
And again, how does what I've suggested impact this?
---
&gt;strat
---
I thought this was going to be about the Guitar Sword.
---
I did it about a week ago and it went through in an hour
---
That would be good but ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt have time to make new characters‚Äù. But they have time to make mules. 
---
Should have just made the use of a survival mode character from the start and earn the way to use their higher level characters. 
---
I didn't say the solution was a fresh start, only that it was my preferred solution. The second solution would result in no impact on character progression.
---
Yes everyone will get there legendaries again but refer to point 6 that I made.
---
As for the benefits of playing in survival mode - Speak for yourself as I do not think they outshine the problems I've highlighted.
---
Build better, smarter bases.
---
"Having lots of turrets"
---
"Located behind white springs club house"
---
"Why?"
---
/r/SlowClapClub
---
no the camp protection wont be for a bit they said
---
Is this trolling? You can't be serious...
---
Given the time it was taken offline 40 minutes should be around the time it‚Äôs back online ( based on previous updates)
---
Pretty sure if you put up the bounty then you are paying to have him killed. The bounty caps probably won‚Äôt come from the wanted player. So not his problem. 
---
I feel bad that I chuckled at that.
---
Part of this can be addressed with perk point freedom. For example, players  level up and then learn their build is gimped. They then must level up 20+ more levels just to fix the perk point allocation. Then Bethesda nerfs something (i.e. demolition from +100% to +60% damage) and you have to go through the whole routine again.
---
The only reason I ever get bounties, lol.
---
Many players with turret camps at golf club are treated like this. And they deserve it. I advise to build somewhere else. 
---
Which is a great thing. Let help them pack their bags
---
When they release player vending I'll definitely have a shop blueprinted and place it down in claimed workshops. My CAMP is in the middle of nowhere and I don't want to move it, which makes for a bad shop location.
---
It doesn‚Äôt VATS you, because it‚Äôs a different mechanic, but it fires auto-tracking missiles... and I‚Äôm fairly certain they ignore chameleon (I was testing missiles against my alt earlier for different reasons, and he‚Äôs got chameleon armor; I‚Äôm pretty sure my missiles were still locking on when he was chameleoned)
---
But most serious PVPers run dense torsos and fireproof perk, which nullifies explosives entirely, so it‚Äôs not that useful.
---
I tried to fight back. They were all 100 plus level. Im not complaining so much as wondering why?
---
Not really. See a response post I made. I think the player base is similar among consoles but different than PC. I currently like the player interactions I have had on PC but have not like what I have heard regarding console players from my friends and from posts here.
---
Hey, I've got a max level 1* TS Dragon.
---
I'm willing to let go of it for free, it's just gathering dust in my stash and would much rather have it find a new owner! :)
---
People will still cry. It‚Äôs pvp.
---
They never said it was coming In this patch, it will be coming sometime in the future though 
---
Lmao I edited in the same idea. Seems pretty reasonable.
---
I'll give it another shot. Thanks!
---
Sometimes i saw ppl have "raider,responder,enclave,etc" next the username, on reddit
---
Sounds like Eve Online lol 
---
Watch this and it will tell you when FO76 is back up for everyone. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/330837/fallout-76-maintenance-march-26-2019?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/330837/fallout-76-maintenance-march-26-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Hehe, you must be new to Reddit.
---
So you ignore literally everybody who said we didn‚Äôt want characters to transfer... awesome. Making survival mode 100% pointless. Well I‚Äôll be sticking to adventure mode where I won‚Äôt get one shotted by a starving, irradiated troll wielding a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
It's a good question, and maybe it ends up being a valid reason to start a new Survival-specific character.  Or else, you just pack away your CAMP before switching modes and have a specific Blueprint for your "Survival CAMP."
---
Good
---
Please show on this doll where the bad man touched you. 
---
On the other hand, you'd also run into people like me. Who's default "I don't feel like coming up with a name no one will see" name is DickFace. 
---
Exactly. Why use a sniper rifle now? You're better off just lobbing a grenade and firing as many rounds as possible. May as well make your handmade an automatic, to get that much more output.
---
New update with new log in problems. WTH 
---
The amount of upvotes versus the ‚Äúcounter‚Äù is something like 10 to 1 in ever thread this is mentioned.
---
There are also really good ideas shared that let current characters play the new mode, and let new characters segment themselves optionally (like Seasons).
---
The most upvotes post in this subreddit in the last week was the post asking for this. It has over 2k upvotes. The comments against it had 20-30 at most.
---
I don't know what game journalist you are talking about. And I don't think you know what a game journalists job is either. YouTubers... for real??? I agree the last part. Only way to be certain is to play it your self. And I have. I really loved fallout 76. 750 hours logged.
---
You don‚Äôt understand.. it‚Äôs full out pvp. You can pair w/buddy but there‚Äôs no compelling reason to stay, FRIENDS! lolz
---
It‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there,  don‚Äôt let anyone know your weaknesses lolz.
---
Anarchy rules.
---
Hopefully when vending machines arrive... 
---
Seems like you could counter that with one perk alone.
---
I have a fully modded T-60, and Excavator set. Working on getting Ultracite up there too.
---
X-01 is nice, but I prefer the look of the T-60, and Ultracite. A friend who was on the server told me the server crashed a little bit after I logged out. Hopefully the guy I gave it to took it.
---
I get you point about it being about exploiting current systems such as trading, but at the end of the day just don't bother with survival. I might give it a quick look but it's just gonna be a fucking   zoo. Like a monkey zoo where they all fight and rape each other.
---
Let the monkeys sling their shit, less shit slingers will be in adventure mode now. 
---
Thatmight be how it‚Äôs intended but I mean come on people are gonna do that I wasn‚Äôt saying I was, I‚Äôm pointing out how many people might misunderstand all of this and actually start playing on Survival and getting rekt.
---
Hey why do they kill me all the time :( The gamemode says Survival but other players are killing me when im coming ou of the vault and i paid so much money on this? W√§hhh w√§hhhh. People always tend to cry first and remain silent after hotfixes.
---
&gt; Quest - Forbidden Knowledge - The quest objective is spelled incorrectly, 'techncial' should be 'technical'
---
I also put the favorites issues in my last list. 
---
Why do they deserve it?
---
You know why
---
Much further distance and element of surprise?  That kind of stuff can happen in Survival
---
Jesus, Bethesda gives us multiple play modes so play whichever you like. Glass half empty kind of guy?
---
Now I am going to try placing the small power posts around and wire between them just to see how they look.
---
Im expecting a lot of Ca.m.p. hunting in adventure mode, crying will intensify.  
---
People who like to complain on the Internet don‚Äôt stop complaining when the things they were complaining about have been fixed.  They simply find new things to complain about.
---
That one‚Äôs already in the atom store too! 
---
Because whitespring turret camps are frowned upon. If I see your camp I'm bringing it down to it's foundations as well. :D
---
What video?
---
It‚Äôs the Bethesda patch notes..
---
Oh sarcasm?
---
It will probably get worse in the coming weeks.  
---
No they‚Äôre saying that half of the caps you spend go to the players bounty. So if you spend 500, 250 will go to the bounty. The minimum you can spend is 200 so the minimum bounty you can put on someone‚Äôs head is 100
---
I don‚Äôt wanna try because if I die I‚Äôll loose my level in caps and that‚Äôs where the crying will come , so In all sense being im using a low new character and level the shit out it , and use my god like character for the soft core times (play it solo )
---
Still? I thought they fixed that with patch 7. I traded with someone recently that had a death claw at their camp, he was chill
---
Obvious troll.
---
They should allow you to have separate CAMPS in Survival Mode. So you can have minimalist/hidden style one there, vs a more overt one in normal mode.
---
build somewhere else buddy. turret grinders behind the clubhouse are frowned upon heavily and will cause everyone to destroy your base if its behind there killing everything. having your camp there is selfish
---
&gt; It would be nice if they could clarify why this mode is listed as a beta
---
Probably because they know there will be bugs to address, and calling it a beta gives them an easy out when people complain about shit.
---
Screamin Jay on radio ‚ù§
---
This is done by making it so you can place any craftable item as if it was a workshop/camp item. it then ends up spawning a bunch of them which are lootable. it can be done with anything that can be crafted at any workbench provided you have the actual materials to do so. the items are bind on pickup and end up as part of your inventory.
---
I'm 90% certain they have adjusted the drop rates but not mentioned it like a few other things they have done. 
---
I ran round an unnuked whitesprings 15 mins before the servers shut down. Normally you will just find all 1* weapons most of which pretty useless and rarely a 2*.
---
I found a level 50 3* vampires automatic machine gun and a 2* level 40 chest. 
---
I didn't have time to double check this but I run whitesprings at least 3 times a day and for the past few weeks have never had a drop like that. 
---
A couple of patches a go they reduced the drop rates they didn't say they did but they must have done something as it seems very coincidental otherwise that there was also a drop rate problem with the rare masks. 
---
Fingers crossed they have actually upped it and It wasn't just a random drop
---
Not glitched for everyone it seems. I got mine 
---
Well, you probably have turrets killing mobs and preventing other people to grind and get their xp and rewards. So, move your base or quit your turrets, or will be the same in every server you hop
---
I make the ugliest workshops on the world and I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm make long floating second floors everywhere so I can hop around the workshop without touching the ground, like the dumbest floor is lava game. 
---
This isn‚Äôt really the place for this complaint. I would also like a cool fasnacht mask, but why do you care so much? There are much bigger issues, and there will likely be many more with the introduction of survival mode. 
---
To fast travel directly to a bounty etc duh 
---
"*Look at this really cool workshop thing we created!  Granted, it's extremely exploitable, and and we nerfed the hell out of the resource outputs, and now people aren't using them anymore for both of those reasons but...we forgot the positive part of these.*" - Bethesda
---
You got what you deserved. Don't build camp with turrets near club house, you ruin the farm for everyone.
---
Now you know.
---
I'm saying calling them ultra rare is a misnomer because I, and plenty of others, think they were fucked up and couldn't drop.
---
Mine is a very old account from before they had a launcher so my gamertag is my login...
---
hopefully not too long then
---
It steals kills, screws up spawns, and annoys people who go there to farm.  Their only recourse is to destroy your camp in hopes you stop doing it.
---
I still don't get how the devs went through with allowing existing Adventure Mode players to bring their characters over to survival despite all the backlash. It's obviously not a good idea.
---
Haha, you KNOW when you are blasting someone with your lever action for 300 damage per bullet and their health barely ticks, then you fire off a crit and they drop in a single shot or at least lose 2/3 of their health and start to panic. "Oh shit! I actually took damage! I...um...what do I dooooo!?!" \*Runs around like a headless chicken\*. That is usually followed by "Dirty pussy sniper!". But when noone can kill them and they are thrashing some poor noob who doesn't understand what's going on they have absolutely no problem with THAT...
---
I agree with you, but also think current characters should be able to play the new mode too.
---
The best idea I‚Äôve seen is to let new characters flag themselves as survival only characters and only join worlds that are survival only.
---
There is so much potential for a completely different experience playing with survival only characters and increases the value of everything!
---
Unfortunately on Xbox, I haven‚Äôt run into many players that actually play the game this way. I wish there was! 
---
And if you stay down there long enough maybe you will emerge in a game that has been improving since launch and is now a petty decent game. I'm talking about fallout 76. I didn't want you to stress your brain too much.
---
I just tested these out on a friend and my friend‚Äôs screen went blurry for awhile. Smoke screen seemed rather impressive too. Is there another effect I‚Äôm missing?
---
*Applauds accordingly* You sir are a super rare commodity! You PvP but only for the betterment of protecting normal people. You're description in my viewpoint: Desert Rangers mixed with Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Now I want the Riot Gear from Fallout: New Vegas... üòï

 [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/6amxflw) looks like it's on console. Also  [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3r5hr/fasnacht_mask_drop_rate_poll_results/) post talks about 1 guy in the group getting a drop. Some of the cosmetic drops in the game are so rare that you probably can't even imagine how rare it is to receive one self. People notice it now because a timed event makes it even tougher in a way. Don't want to sound rude but it's called extremely rare for a reason.  
---
Servers aren't up yet
---
Servers aren‚Äôt up yet ?
---
Servers are offline for maintenance
---
I care bc I and tons of others put hours in our lives grinding an event that could have just been bugged the entire time.
---
And this is just a good a place as any other - latest patch notes posted by the community outreach account.
---
Again, literally no reason to be against transparency. 
---
Some high level players get bored with being nice to everyone so they start fucking with other people. Theyre not all like that but maybe like 1 in 10. Plus youve never heard of hive mentality? One person does it and the rest are like well he did it with no consequence im gonna do it too and it spirals from there
---
Yeah workshops are pretty useless after certain level, when you know where to farm what. It was cool to go around and farm them as low level though. I hope they bring something new/new rewards to them in the future.
---
server still down for patch day bro. quick searcherino would've told you this.
---
Ah, yes; the tried and true tactic of responding to a well-thought out post that completely dismantled your argument with questions.
---
I think the point here you're missing is all of your suggestions will mean nothing two weeks into using them. Waste of development time and effort, I'd rather them keep the content rolling and let me play how I want.
---
It's fine how it is.
---
Yeah I like that suggestion too. 
---
Sorry to be a nusance but what does H: and W: mean? I've seen it before but wasn't sure.
---
His account is one month old though.
---
This account lacks required entitlements... wtf
---
Yes! And be matched with other survival mode only characters. The game is completely different if you need to build a character and collect things in the unique environment survival mode provides!
---
Every trip to a quest area is extra intense and dangerous! When someone can‚Äôt just switch modes to farm, the value of everything is greatly increased!
---
If you read the guys post it was a list of quests, hence why I responded to answer them individually. The reason I asked further questions is because none of them would be impacted by my post. It was about as well thought out as your response.
---
If you actually read my post and refered to point 6 you would realise why your argument about "in two weeks it won't matter" is void.
---
Also... Waste of development time and efforts? We're talking about change a few rules sets and looking at the most powerful legendary effects that would impact the game play to make it more fair. 
---
At that point everyone has the same opportunity to level.  If you can‚Äôt do it or haven‚Äôt the means to is simply a matter of choice. 
---
Not to mention with the over saturated market and gear even a level 20 can get access to god gear. 
---
down voted for beating a dead horse and complaining about a mode you haven't even tried yet.
---
Rose once told me to taste human. I prefer eating humas over fruits now. #notovegans
---
Oh right, confusion over. I thought you were the poster for a minute there too.
---
Are you trolling or just stupid? 
---
In a game where the Chinese are referred to as the Red menace, capitalism is so rampant that nearly all people in West Virginia before the war we were replaced with robots, and corporations that perform sickening social experiments on regular people and children, Bethesda poking fun at anti alcoholics is what you have a problem with? I don't see how it's their fault that you're offended by a personal issue in your life, but hey, admitting you have a problem with the game is the first step right? 
---
Please no
---
I was wondering. Will I be able to complete quest objectives in adventure and switch to survival to turn them in for the xp bonus?
---
Could be yes. Have yet to see one myself. If the drop rate is really that low a timed event does make it kind of insane. Luckily I don't care for the masks. Find the whole situation kind of funny.
---
Haha great picture my friend! 
---
ITT: I LOVE timed events, but I deserve everything from them, despite me missing the time window...of the blatantly communicated timed event...
---
I got one for 36 caps from a vendor so that's roughly what they're worth.
---
Not necessarily. I was at WS and someone walked away from their excavator PA while crafting.
---
I accidentally stole someone‚Äôs raider armor this exact way. Assumed it was random drop or abandoned.
---
Read patch notes. My words are no longer marked. 
---
UN MARK THEM!
---
I've never seen the community come together like this to tell someone off.
---
I'm so proud of you all.
---
It was mentioned not in patch notes but recently by the Bethesda people.  I'd have to dig around and find where it is, but it was clearly indicated CAMP locations would be now unable to be damaged by people.
---
It doesnt prevent grind. It assists.
---
The red stove was just in the shop since last week, don't know if it's still there with today's update. I'm digging the daggers, but I agree, need rifle/heavy gun skins. Thanks for the datamine!
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
I mean, if you pick the right ones you can still eat human and fruits. üòÇ

Some of us have been running the "evil" path in fallout games for years. Shame fo4 didnt have any evil path until DLCs... Even then it was WEAK!
---
I can clean club house in 20-30seconds, do you think i need help from turrets? What your turrets do is taking aggro of the ghouls and killing them before i tag them.
---
I hate that no one ever visits, I am so lonely.
---
The community agrees that do they?

---
Also, I never said anything about forcing everyone to restart their characters. You keep putting words in my mouth.
---
Nice, nothing I want. Also, my character is loaded on chems all the time and I‚Äôve yet to catch a single addiction. (And I‚Äôm not running any anti-addiction perks)
---
P.S. I actually don't agree with any of the nerfs they did to us.
---
I‚Äôd say once you hit 60-70 range, a well planned out build would be essentially the same as 350. One might not necessarily have access to all the perks they want to slot by level 57. Your overall point makes sense though.
---
Whitesprings is the main community area and a turret base there ruins everyone's gameplay there. It's like bringing a jet-ski to the community pool. 
---
Also, if you build on the pond next to Charleston station you will get the same treatment.
---
I'm consenting to pvp in the workshop. By taking a workshop in the big I'm not saying that I want someone to come to my camp in the forest to cap me. If that were the case nobody would ever willingly own a workshop. 
---
Bethesda knows what we want, but you know... fuck us and all...

there is also a round hand drum in the wild we cant get plans for

A protein-rich diet is always preferred in the post apocalypse.
---
This isn't a "must-do" but head NE of Vault 76 and do the event Leader of the Pack when it pops up. You'll get to fight legendary wolves which can drop some great low level gear. 
---
Are the servers back up? Either way you want to use them to confuse your opponent in hopes they start moving, thus becoming more vulnerable. Or get them irradiated before they know it's happening.
---
thats why i said "should". i talked to Bethesda maybe a week or 2 ago and they said "find a flat place to build your camp" like im an idot. They have no flat spots. I've been building since beta. I know how to build a camp.
---
I run a small faction called the Appalachian Guardians. We protect the innocent against the raiders, we focus on survival mode but we operate in adventure mode too. We have a full rank system and a base and everything. We are only on Xbox at the moment and if you are Interested in joining leave you gt below so I can add you to the club 
---
Why though?
---
Isnt the drawback from abuse of those chems a bitch though? must be tough even for raiders
---
Breaking news! New mode brings new mechanics and concerns. Local man doesn‚Äôt like it!
---
Melee builds cut through too much armour IMO. Should be 50% not 75‚òπÔ∏è
---
Try building behind the train station. It still makes for an easy grind but is far enough away that people won‚Äôt hate on u.
---
I was able to finish the Mix It Up! challenge right on time, thanks again for your suggestions! Took a lot of server hopping to spawn the lemonade vendor, but after that, smooth sailing. 
---
Are you telling me one of the biggest gaming studios can't do what tons of survival games have done already? Most indie studios that have put out survival games have the option for PVE and PVP. 
---
Lol golden 
---
Absolutely agree. If you delete photos from the in game gallery they are still stored on your system but no longer show up as loading screens. Maybe this could be a way of holding onto those old photos so that you can clear up some space for new ones. 
---
Ah nice. Good list!
---
CAMPs are still vulnerable to attack. Last week's ITV stated "in a future update" which meant they were not included in this week's  "survival mode" update.
---
Not trolling. Seriously. Feeling trolled on though. I really just dont get the mind set. I built it there to try and help me and others. Its a good resource in a good location.
---
I want the kettle drum (?) from the frat house, mouth harp too!
---
There is still a bug in the ‚ÄúAn Ounce of Protection‚Äù quest where we cannot collect a blood sample from a feral ghoul.
---
Is this going to get fixed?
---
I'm not a raider, but I do like stealing people's corn and razorgrain. Even better if I manage it undetected and am able to sell it back to them hahaha!
---
Bump.
---
Griefers are screwed. They won‚Äôt go where they could get their asses handed. AND, they can‚Äôt bully lowbies and pacifists with slap damage.
---
 I used to block griefers GTs, dont even have to do that anymore ! Whoo hoo! Lolz
---
That was the primary advantage snipers had. Distance, and the ability to catch someone unaware. If one shot kills are no longer possible, in the time to reload for a second shot, or switch to another gun, the target has had time to; a) break vats by jumping, b) pop stealth, or c) move behind a friggin tree. At which point we no longer have a crit saved, and have to break stealth to **close distance**, engage and try to kill them before they can heal or run away.
---
99 percent of the assets you see in fo76 are from Fallout 4. 
---
Myself and a friend we actually planning to hang out between the Vault and Flatwoods to kill any high-levels that felt the need to grief the newly made characters.
---
We get to help newly rolled/re-rolled toons, plus farm caps from assholes.  Win-win.
---
Seriously mate, stop trolling the people; you have a post from 2 month ago asking the same. It doesn't assist anything, it kills mobs and you dont get any xp or reward from mobs, neither the people. If you dont quit turrets or move your camp, people Will keep destroying it. Personally that's the only bounty I usually get over my head, destroying camps like yours :)
---
Armor is everything on PvP. Without my armor set I‚Äôd die if I tripped on a stick, and I would deal a fraction of the damage I am now. 
---
These 2IQ responses are my favourite.
---
The great Odin once said "A wise king never looks for a fight but must always be prepared for one." I've always seems like the outsider since this game started. Pvp is annoying in this game and the simple fact that im good at it bores me more of it. Much rather kill the queen or help people do quests. My absolute favorite is gifting new players with deep pocketed heavy leather armor and a BOS recon sniper. Makes my day when i see them leveling up fast because i helped them succeed. 
---
Your description makes me proud as ive always admired the Brotherhood of Steel. The fact that youd mix that with a desert ranger makes want to break out new vegas so bad lol. If only we could get legacy outfits from previous games, in 76. Thank you. 
---
And revenue I imagine 
---
Hunter's Ridge on west side of map south of Point Pleasant. The road just below it has different respawns - one gets you trapper armor.
---
Server are offline bud
---
SBQ drop 
---
Same.  Not totally let down though.
---
Be nice to have a base camp and a tent camp with just the absolute basics. Maybe have a stock blueprint that has a large tent, bed and crafting tables with a stash box. I have this blueprint to use for fast camps when moving my main to test the new spot for attackers.
---
scorchbeasts rarely drop them.  Scorchbeast queen drops one guaranteed.  Although I've almost learned them all so I'm not sure if she continues to do so once you know all of them. It's a long list, so finding the one you want might be easier to get on the marketplace / buy and sells.
---
Yeah, dying should have a bigger consequence so that even when a friend kills you it's bad, bounty should come 2x from the dying player (player with 100 caps bounty dies, leaves 100 on the floor but loses 200, just so that can't be bounty "cleaning" with friends without consequences).
---
Also there needs to be some time of debuff for dying without enough caps for the bounty, not sure of an way this can be implemented without too much issues...
---
Some one will find a way to cheese the concept of still one shotting another. 
---
Instead you'll see people running around with makes like "stealth sniper" "2 hand melee" and mule1". And you'll still see guys named longdongbong69. Or you'll get in a server with 5 Silver Shrouds and 10 Paladin Danses.
---
That's because the game is still down for maintenance. 
---
The woodland pump screens also show 2 new outfits.
---
Things like medicare, medicaid, social security, etc.
---
Am I wrong?
---
Yeah but it says death deduction such as caps have been doubled
---
Thank you for sharing knowledge but we are talking about patch v7.5. So you know many difference on every patch. You are trully right about previous patches. But as they mentioned in v7.5 we will gain damage from cars. But, we can see any bug causes prevent this environmental damages.
---
Because it basically steals the kills from there for no gain at all. Your turret kills don't give you anything. So anyone looking to farm there are SOL because of you and your turrets. Wasted kills.
---
Among other things.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Neither. Just never heard anyone complain until last night. Every other server people like it.
---
Out of the total three prime receiver plans I've found so far, two of them were found in the same box in the basement of the location just north of West-Tek. I don't remember the exact name of the place, but there's a few Super Mutants there, and this specific box is in the basement with the "boss" mutant of the area.
---
It might have been completely random that I happened to find prime receiver plans there twice, but I have a sneaking suspicion that certain containers have high chances of spawning in specific recipes. A few other lockpickable containers around the world seem to often spawn in recipes when I swing by, typically of the same types; base building, weapon mods, etc.
---
If you don't know which place I'm talking about in case you wanna check it out, I can give you the exact name once the servers are up :)
---
Those are that things you are playing with in tetris
---
This. Honestly the only reason i'm gonna be playing in Survival is because of the "evil" and more grey players. the suspense of coming upon another person and having to get out of the encounter with either a fight or talking is what makes this all worth for me in these games.
---
See point 6.
---
People will still cry in PVE.  PVP will as well but this change really happened because of the constant negative feedback from those that didn't want anything to do with PVP that were playing.  Which, I'm sorry, but from Bethesda's original E3 reveal on this, they made it completely clear that they wanted people to engage in PVP.  If you want to be a raider, be a raider.  Then the PVE only community starts crying about it.  Makes me laugh.  I play a very social game.  I help out a lot of new players and even use my own resources to craft them power armor, weapons etc.  At the same time, if someone came to me and initiated PVP and I lost, good on them.  It doesn't make me cry.  Hell, just round up a posse and hit them back!
---
Will still be crying. For instance. I can start a new character for survival and kill a lv 100+ player for easy caps because weapons are normalized for pvp. But if they kill me it's just pocket change I lose.
---
Probably also a bit of crying when they over nerf weapons. Or people find a real OP weapon compared to all the nerfed ones.
---
GT on XBox One: F1DL5TYX
---
I want his hat.
---
Is it just me or do ALL daily quests feel bugged?
---
Hmm, yes, its as if there was never any kind of game-wide bug that might have changed the kinds of gear that existing adventure mode characters would have had widespread access to that they otherwise wouldn't have.
---
The existing adventure mode characters are all completely legitimate. There was never anything untoward.  
---
Folks will pair up or 3man fire teams just to assess. But, the whole point pvp. And with a leaderboard to boast and brag, friendships die quickly.
---
Yes... Even better...
---
nope
---
Don't see how anything I've suggested impacts this? 
---
Yah excwpt it feels a little unwarrented. I didnt know. Thought people like it there.
---
If I could vent, Beth obsesses over the nuka brand. With it's own DLC and almost everything in their merch store being Nuka related item. I hate it. There are so many other things they can sell if they wanted to.
---
On a similar topic, We need Team Camps. 
---
- Setup a permanent team for a small amount of caps 
---
- Team Leader has control of moving team camp location 
---
- All Team members can build and move objects around in the team camp 
---
- it could possibly have extra Budget or a slightly bigger radius
---
- if the team leader leaves the team then the camp is removed but is saved for when they form another team. 
---
Ummm a massive update?
---
Ah sorry. I ‚Äújust‚Äù tested them yesterday before the patch.
---
The only real issue I see being a problem is being able to bring in previously made characters. Those characters have month's of end game loot, enough mats to make all the ammo / meds they need, and easily enough caps to not give a shit about any "bounties". Now, if Survival was limited to brand new characters only the other issues are moot..
---
- In any survival game people can lie about trading. It is a risk you take interacting with others.
---
- Server hop to avoid someone just hunting you down, or use the bounty system. (might be a bit harder if they have friends but like in all survival games this also encourages you to make friends to play with as well).
---
- Perk builds are going to vary. Since the nerfing of TSE, and more deadly PvP you might see less PA and more Chameleon CA combined with high vats crits (as an example of diversity)
---
- Again a survival game where you get ganked by a group of friends, also encourages you to make friends to play with. If you want to lone wolf it you acknowledge the fact you are playing at a disadvantage *on purpose*. The option to find people to help you is there.
---
- See above, caps won't have much value as you can get them more readily from hunting other players who may be around your level / gear range.
---
Like I said most of that is pointless cause people will bring in their 300-400+ level characters with the best end game gear and just destroy newer players or people rerolling a low level alt. If they limit it to new characters only, most of those issues can organically be solved.
---
Maintenance. 
---
Patience child:
---
Look through this Reddit and you'll see just how much people do not like it there.
---
It's definitely warranted, whether you were aware of the circumstances or not.
---
Chalk it up to experience and build elsewhere.
---
I hear you have to spam drugs (like 5 in a row) to get addicted.  
---
Went to school with a Harold Dick. How much do you have to hate your kid to saddle them with a name like that?
---
Awesome im on now, Buttspawn. Thank you so much!!
---
Exactly, I dont think people understand this. Guy kills you and takes your caps, so you spend even more of your own caps to have him hunted down by other people who then get your caps IF they kill him. Which chances are low that they will if he's a good player. So you lose 3400 caps, he loses none, maybe a couple hundred from getting killed if he gets swarmed. If he hasn't transfered the caps by then. 
---
It's worse when they're not even in the hedge and are just jumping around attacking and invisible. Not just stealth boy invisible, but "seems like my game is broken" invisible.
---
If someone can cap me in the head because they're good then that's awesome, if they can kill be instantly because of stuff they bought that's kinda lame
---
Dude how is pointing out a possible bug "nonsensical reeing?"
---
If drop rates for in game items are not working properly, that is an actual issue.
---
I understand the trepidation, I really do. Bethesda made some truly bizarre design choices for a game that features PvP and I find a lot of it frustrating as well. I don't like that some dweeb who bought all his stuff off reddit can be functionally invincible and one shot a full health person in power armor with a magic mole miner gauntlet. It not only sucks to play against but it's disrespectful to the series' own lore.
---
However, the rewards in PvP are intriguing and we definitely stand a better chance together. Solo survival would be a shit show
---
Yeah if you are level 300 fighting level 50. With same build. Haha.
---
Ill be roleplaying in survival and PvPing in adventure.
---
If you honestly think the developer is trying to make the base game unenjoyable to push aesthetic shop purchases, you're being a pill.  That makes zero sense.  The Atom Store isn't going to fix a game that's not fun to start with.
---
I got this yesterday whilst the servers were up. I thought I was banned at first, but obviously tried to relog and it was fine. I'm guessing it was just some mix up/ bug. Wouldn't be worried unless you have actually been exploiting/cheating. 
---
Name sounds about right. At the very least it's in the area, yeah.
---
Just use the locations on the map. There are plenty of place to camp out.
---
Skins would probably be good enough in this case.  Depends on what the challenges are I guess.  They don't need to be meta weapons, or even good weapons, for people to want to collect them.  Its a small incentive for people who might otherwise avoid Survival to hop on for a bit. 
---
Both side has keypad that opens the door.
---
If they made sleeping more useful, such as a way to temporarily remove diseases and addictions, I'd be happy to spend 20 pounds of my carry weight on a tent which you could sleep in and  fast travel to. It should be free to move and put down as often as you want but maybe it consumes hunger to do so?
---
But there would have to be limitations, you can't have a stash in your inventory that would be too easy, perhaps a footlocker that isn't tied to the stash system and has a 20 pound limit. But beware people could steal from it! Also it would need a radius around it which if you were outside of you couldn't fast travel to it. 
---
How's that?
---
This is such a short sighted outlook.
---
No problem, I'll add you as soon as the servers are live!
---
No one has played this mode yet so we‚Äôll see. Unless they are double dipping, the bountied player would lose no caps and you would pay the bounty to the player that killed him. That‚Äôs what would make sense. You put up the reward for someone to kill a player for killing you. It‚Äôs more of a pride/revenge feature. 
---
It's why I have Orbital Strikes.
---
Serves me right! For some reason I wasn't finding anything online, and it wasn't showing me the maintenance message like it was earlier in the day. Sorry guys! Thanks for the response.
---
One alcohol, please
---
I dropped a small mat and then placed confetti on it and continued placing confetti on confettis.
---
What about Boomer's daily quest never activating? Been trying to do it for a month but i never get a quest from him. 
---
Is this a bug or im missing a trigger element?
---
Awesomeüëçüèª
---
So you used to lose caps equal to your level? Hmm I never knew that
---
I have a nice big beautiful base, I will not be changing it, its on a lake with a great view. My plan is that the lowered Tier of the base is open for any and all to enjoy the crafting stations as well as 2 unlocked water purifiers. my goal is to give the inhabitants of the land anything they need if the happen upon my base. I get that tis gonna be open game to anyone to destroy but maybe 50% of the time they wont feel obliged to attack my base and instead will be happy I am offering  them free services?  HAHAHA I know right .. but even in this post apocalyptic world you have some places that are neutral .. maybe i'll get lucky .. PLUS I know if I walked up on a cool looking base I most likely would admire it and not attack it .. We shall see ..  
---
And yes .. no rad showers are gonna be out .. But Will use the above posters Idea .. place it .. walk through it and then store it hahaha. 
---
Also .. I keep thinking I am gonna load into a war zone .. and its gonna be crazy .. but pretty sure its gonna be just as it is now, maybe 20 people on .. and gonna be rare instance I will see them. But I think the cat and mouse part of it will feed the flames.. My question to you guys .. 
---
Will you play the part of a raider or will you play the part of the Raider Hunter? .. 
---
I keep forgetting that stupid people don't realize they are stupid.  My bad.
---
It is amusing that the games premise and story is 'get out there and rebuild together!' and now there is a mode where the residents of 76, who grew up together in the vault, will be killing each other on sight.
---
I'm with you though. Would be fun teaming up with a bunch of friends and rolling about helping folks, Responder style.
---
uninstalling my game
---
I was just ranting to my wife about this ü§£
---
Can't you understand that you are in effect punishing the players that play the game most?
---
They can either restart a character or have nothing?
---
I farmed and farmed for the few decent legendaries I have and I want to use them on players. 
---
I have never PVP'd in normal mode because that is rude. This is a mode for that and I want to use my gear. 
---
Alright! I'm in central time zone US and generally play in the evenings. 
---
You fuck up the spawns for everyone, when I go and farm WS, I like to sneak and kill them where they spawn or roam. Your camp would cause them to run towards your shitstain camp and ruin my method of killing the ghouls. It's not helping anyone but yourself. You don't even get EXP when you aren't there tagging it. 
---
I don't need your shitty turret camp to help me with them when I one shot every ghoul inside the club house. If you still think it's a good idea, I hope your camp gets destroyed every server you enter.
---
1 robot per camp, you can setup a patrol path and can learn robot part combos from killing the robots (they will now drop plans for their model)
---
Servers are down still. 
---
no we don't
---
Yeah just noticed they were done haha
---
Full assasins gear waiting ...
---
Oh i was throwing super stimpacks from queen away as i got over 100. That was bad decision, should mule it.
---
Thought so, I've found 2 PR plans there as well.
---
Here you go! On the house 
---
I doubt it, group of 4 friends will just form their team and start hunting down other players only killing each other when necessary to clean bounties.
---
For me survival mode is a place for everyone that wants to enjoy PvP with no restrictions can go and do it and leave Adventure mode for the PvE Aspect. WIN-WIN.
---
Cool beans. Can‚Äôt wait to team up.
---
And if survival was around when that happened it would be the same scenario and again, we‚Äôd be doing a full circle. Fresh start would be and is useless.
---
The game is very different now than when it launched, and farming or even doing quests has much greater danger in survival mode. I don‚Äôt doubt that at one point there will be a power convergence, but it is much greater than a week, and that time between now and then is not worthless. It offers a very unique experience that isn‚Äôt possible currently.
---
Point still stands.
---
Hahaha I can just see players running around in power armor with the trade emoji. 
---
rigght? i logged on at 8:30 am est, no balloons, no streamers, no nothing.
---
I think it's safe to say the theory about specific loot assigned to specific containers holds true then. Definetely worth checking it out now and then for anyone interested in getting those plans!
---
Having your camp behind the club makes Gould respawn a lot less, I‚Äôd advise moving it people don‚Äôt tend to enjoy camps there and always grief if noticed 
---
And let me have my Sentrybot Ada as a companion heh heh 
---
I like this idea but I really must insist that until we have functional hot tubs at our camps ALL development assets at Bethesda should be dedicated to that purpose. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Hope Beth is listening. 
---
You're not losing anything. All of your progress will be retained in adventure.
---
With what i've suggested you can even take your characters progress into survival, just not your gear.
---
I think I've got about 10 photos! I've never had that problem! Mine are all the old camps I've had so I can remember how I decorated them. But having some nice view you've captured or standing over a beast you've slain would look great hanging above the toilet!
---
me too  i hope Bethesda listens to the feedback about the workshop exploit
---
Cause even if they make a new character, it will happen soon enough because the people who can invest more time will hit full build within a week. Then you're a level 20 vs a level 120 and do you really want that?
---
It's right in the patch notes. And the preview article. Pretty sure its confirmed. 
---
Trolling around waiting for the servers to come up.
---
Yeah same, still working on my dream camp but it would get perma destroyed at it's current location. I have an alt I can deck out though. The 20% xp will benefit him too.
---
Youre still on the hud and my berry mentats say otherwise 
---
He should list his GT so everyone can come and "admire" his awesome camp.
---
I have 62 super stims ready for sale...gonna leave it a few days for the price to go up.
---
Just out of interest how much they go for atm.
---
I agree. We are the minority tho. Just get yourswlf a bounty and wait? Claim a workshop and wait?
---
Servers are up, but locked to BGS employees. Usually happens an hour or two before they switch them back to public following an update.
---
They're better, but still inferior to their ballistic counterparts. Major issue energy weapons still have is that they don't pierce energy resistance, and any perk or legendary effect that adds piercing only adds ballistic piercing, which is useless on laser weapons and only useful for half of plasma's damage. They're not unusable, but they're just inferior.
---
I had this same idea when we first got wind of survival mode I agree this is a great idea I don‚Äôt know why it would be a bad idea at all
---
I have canes and drills. Let's open a legendary bed bath and beyond 
---
okay, we get it. You're going to defend this game's shitty server system no matter what we say. Point taken.
---
Had this yesterday. I did a scan and repair and all was well 
---
What's the reward for longest life?
---
How you know that not anyone before you‚Äôre brother and father stood guard was there ? Just server hop and wish for the best :) took me along time to get the key. Then even longer to get the plans to spawn 
---
I want it! 
---
THIS! I have been wondering this myself, do people have mad add or something? 
---
I KNEW it! Damn one percent! Now they take my video games too?
---
Don‚Äôt speak for the community , speak for yourself 
---
If your going to display our locations to other players when you're a top player there should actually be a reward other then bragging rights. It doesnt make sense to me that penalties are doubled for dying but let's not reward the people in any meaningful way surviving. Maybe cap rewards for being 1,2,3 top survivors. Or at the very least just dont make them lose caps for dying after being in the top three.
---
I'm sure it'll work exactly how it does now. Don't see why they would change that at all
---
In reality, there's no difference between a bug fix and a feature change (except the source).  Bug fixes should usually be a higher priority, I agree, but that doesn't change the fact that you're stirring up the code, which can have far-reaching consequences.
---
There was a great article written *years* ago by a MS developer about a small bug that under really hard to pin down circumstances would lock up MS Word docs.  It went into the detail about what it took to track it down, all the intricacies and issues that came up, and what all it took to get it all sorted out.  It seems to have disappeared recently, it was called "The anatomy of a software bug" or something similar.  I've been trying to track it down again for discussions like these, it really gave some insight into how complicated these things can actually get.
---
I bought thr plans at a vendor, only to find the plans at Greg's or grays mines.  Not sure what it was called.  I have an extra. On Xbox 
---
BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
---
HA HA HA HA HA!
---
Ha ha heh heh heh
---
*sniffles, wipes away a tear*
---
*deep breath*
---
BWA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
This sorta happened to me last night.
---
Was doing the parade event when a nuke drop was announced. Immediately checked the map and it was in Watoga. Ignored all the subsequent warnings until BOOM.
---
I figure someone launched the nuke on watoga first knowing people would do what I did then immediately launched on Helvetia shortly after. Kind of genius.
---
First time I've been nuked in game and not even mad about it. I already had enough intestines just in case but that robot didn't even activate.
---
Bait.
---
well they say PvP combat so I assume just vs players 
---
That was FO4. As far as I know FO76 has never had it.
---
I do.
---
xD
---
Hey how about sharing  your experiences of survival mode, on YouTube  so that we can see if you‚Äôre right?
---
You seem like a troll only replying to comments that tell you not to do it there but you ignore the posts about why you shouldn't.
---
Ok. So to tell you why you shouldn't do what you are doing. 
---
When you build a base with turrets there it will attract enemies to you as they spawn. And when someone passes by all the enemies will be dead and they won't gain exp or loot. Even if they pass by often there is only a super slim chance they can hit an enemy at least once before the tutters kill it which basicly kills the entire spawn. People won't just sit there and wait for things to spawn as it's a slow and painful wait. It gets even worse when someone has turrets taking half the kills from them.
---
If your base had no turrets I wouldn't mind it. But if I see a single turret I will flatten that base to the ground as many times as it takes.
---
I don't get the big deal either.
---
When you drop or sell, remove the name... Easy... 
---
I don't think it's a bad or good idea. I just think it was the least upsetting choice for them to make. I don't really care too much. I will still have fun and enjoy the game as a PVE player. Let Pvpers go have their fun away from us. That's fine.  The economy/dupe problem DOES need to be addressed and addressed FAST though. Caps are close to useless especially when you're constantly hitting your max limit. The best currency in the game is legendary items and they are being duped. You can create Caps sinks, but it's not so simple with the more valuable items.  This game definitely needs more cap sinks though, the currency is not scarce at all. Charging caps to respect your characters special attributes is something me and my friend were talking about when considering cap sinks.  Sadly that would be a micro transaction opportunity more than a sink . I like to switch my char up a lot, therefore paying to respect is very viable and charging caps to do that would be great. Levelling still has a purpose considering the amount of perk cards out there. 
---
thank you for the reply ! i've already got batteries included as i carry enough fusion cores to power liberty prime ! i'll definitely look into trying out those guns, i'm gonna start easy and mod some laser rifles up and have a go with them. i don't know if it is just me, but the physics feel different with the energy weapons in 76 vs. prior fallout games. i'm def gonna work on this for sure though, thank you for the advice üíõ
---
&gt; addiction disappears
---
I've personally noticed this happening after Vintage Nukashine blackouts pretty consistently, so it could be that or fast travel maybe? 
---
Not dumb, just didnt know. This is why i hate the internet though. People feel like they can be rude and mean to others because of anonymity. 
---
What is your armor set though?
---
Honestly, this is why Ricochet should affect players or VATS not work on players, which has an easy in world explanation as a ‚Äúsafety‚Äù feature. I think Ricochet is funny because it makes cheap shots into Russian Roulette. 
---
Alot of people are looking at this the wrong way, it has NOTHING to do with levelling for me and many others, it's the broke ass duped to heaven god build economy. If you don't have a god build there's essentially no point in playing Survival mode at all, unless you duped yourself and have alts of alts at cap limit, you're not going to be playing and/or enjoying Survival mode.  
---
I was REALLY looking forward to true PvP and a fair system, not a system where a duper caan just go over and just running around taking 5% of damage, and absolutely stupid idea, the two modes SHOULD have been seperate after the duping nonsense, it's just logical, Hell even Ark done it by leaving the Legacy servers behind.
---
What a waste.
---
I wear the hunters long coat its from the rare responder bot trader here is a video on how to spawn him https://youtu.be/_BGIZu7yETA
---
Don‚Äôt do the missions right away gain some levels before so you get higher level gear. Also if you want raider power armor lvl 15 go north of vault 76 to the crossair raider camp by the mountains it‚Äôs a set spawn place for low level power armor. If you aim to do vendor runs with your character make sure to get hard bargain 3 under charisma. If/when you are ready to get mutations make sure to have the luck perk starched genes so you won‚Äôt loose the mutations from taking radaways or disease cures. Leader of the pack is a good event to do so you can get low lvl weapons and armor
---
Are you serious? If I spawn in at golf club and hear these fcking turrets blasting, the first thing I do is go to this camp and demolish it. Then I ask someone to remove my bounty, some even pay me the rewards back because they know destroying these shit bases is the only way they learn. 
---
That's because camp protection is in the work. 
---
People will just get their friends to collect their bounties, like it's always been.
---
The bounty system needs a lot of fixes.
---
Demolition man
---
No, im saying that copying every existing character, creating a system to only remove specifically items from that character, and adding those new characters to a brand new gamemod without any issues isn't worth it to them, and at this point its unlikely they will try.
---
Better than losing 600 caps.
---
How are they forming large groups when it‚Äôs not even deployed or available yet?
---
But if you‚Äôre part of a large pvp group, I‚Äôd like to see how you and your team perform in survival mode.
---
It's like they're running out of original ideas.
---
From the way it‚Äôs setup it would seem as though Besthesda expects people to start off in Adventure Mode and then move to Survival Mode for a greater challenge and reward. 
---
They aren‚Äôt preventing anyone from starting over a new character to solely play Survival Mode with. They are even giving Survival Mode a 20% XP boost. If your ballsy enough to go into Survival Mode with a level 1 character you get to level up quicker. 
---
Have you thought about what would happen if everyone was forced to start over in Survival Mode? Everyone would camp the Vault 76 for kills. Not only would any new person get slaughtered by anyone that was playing even a few minutes longer than them, but newbies would be slaughtering themselves before even making to the Overseer‚Äôs Camp.
---
Beyond that this game has to appeal to a wider audience than just to people who have the time/dedication/care to make multiple other characters. The majority of the players I see are struggling to get by as it is on one character in Adventure Mode. You want to force them to have to start over from scratch in a Free-For-All PvP gamemode?
---
Get a grip man. The way Bethesda is going about this CURRENTLY seems to be fair for the largest portion of the playerbase. Let‚Äôs wait and see what needs adjusting until after we have actually played the game mode. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about if someone would invite someone to a game and trick them into joining a survival mode.
---
I‚Äôve seen equal amounts of posts from people in favor of both sides of this argument and both sides claims no one wants the other.
---
It‚Äôs hilarious. 
---
Not my kinda trap, but cool nonetheless.
---
Again, the fresh start is only a fresh start at the beginning. Two weeks later, you're going to have people dominating. Meanwhile you inconvenience current and future players that have already invested in adventure and don't want to invest in a new character just so they can play in a PVP free-for-all. Allowing characters to do both is a better long term decision than reactively gating it behind new characters just because some of them may have duped items.
---
Pretty sure they said they were going to bring it in in one of the next several patchs
---
If not tomahawks, then maybe a crossbow. Those are really cool and don‚Äôt get enough love 
---
For sensing air.
---
You were all thinking it, I just said it ;)
---
People can invite someone to a game to trade and trick someone into joining survival mode.
---
amazing, thank you for the reply ! this is what i was thinking, i just wasn't sure if there was anything i was missing out on as i've only really dipped my toes in the whole EW thing in this one. 
---
u/bethesdagamestudios. Thanks alot all there is going to be copyed items and legendarys handed out. Thanks I thought this was going to be a rebirth, not repeating your past. 
---
The suggestion that no active involvement effects the drops is reasonable but I personally don't buy into that theory.
---
I tested both little or no involvement (but active quest) and full involvement.    
---
Consistently my high CHA characters got better "drops" than the High luck characters, even when they did nothing but stand in my camp for the duration.    
---
There were only a handful of times no reward was given, but that happened on fully engaged characters as well.  
---
The majority of people showing off masks either didn't comment on where they got them, or purchased them off another player (there is a comment referencing that in this post I think), so Providence can't be established, which is why there is doubt, and again none of the hundreds of people who are vocal, and did the event collectively tens of thousands of times saw anything but the common drops, reinforcing the doubt.  
---
\*nod\*    
---
I've said a couple times in other posts and here I think the Definition of "Rare" and "Uncommon" are different for us (The Community at Large) and Bethesda, and I think the larger problem is there does not seem to be a Middle Ground in this game, items are either Common or Exceptionally hard to obtain, very few examples of what I'd classify as "Uncommon" and most of the examples we have are what most people would consider "Super Rare" based on other games.  
---
As for if the Dev's looked into it, "maybe"...   
---
Because the point is less about the coding and more about the actual event.  
---
I know from Personal Experince in Modding something can be coded 100% correctly, however "In the Field" function differently, to look into it, atleast in my eyes, they would have had to either Force Completed the event dozens upon dozens of times, or run it beginning to end the same number of times to see if it was operating correctly.   
---
The lack of aggressive Playtesting is established by how poorly heavy weapons functions for the first 4 months of the game, and is reinforced by the fact Laser Guns are still not really viable compared to the ballistic weapons.  
---
None of the above is meant as a slight or insult, just how I (and many others) perceive the state of things.  
---
As to if it's a "Tin-Foil Hat" kind of thing, I'm not suggesting a conspiracy at all, more of a disconnect between how they think something should function, and how it actually does....  
---
And based on previous transparency I doubt they would release that data, as to date they've declined to do the same in other instances, including what the current active player base is, which is fairly unusual for an online game.   
---
Complicated variables would make more sense in many ways, but if that was the case they should have provided clues, or made it a solo event, because it's completely unreasonable and unrealistic to think it's in the realm of possible to control and account for 11 other players behavior. 
---
Additionally if the only way for the event to succeed was something as random as "No Popped Balloons" and the robots march to the finish line in Reverse order of rarity the Community would loose their collective minds not only because of the lack of clues, but the fact outside of forcibly trying to bug the robots out to control their marching order there is no way to account for that.
---
Hmmm did I place one or two mines? I think only one, I'll put another one down. 
---
Yeah, I'm that dumb.
---
You run the samw risk in any game with server wide chat, the omly difference is the number of people you can reach at once, and theres always an option to report/block
---
Apparently explosive damage by-passes armour penetration, so if you have an AAE 50 cal vs a stock one you're actually better off with a stock one In PA, according to this logic 
---
I just wanna watch the world, burn....üò≥
---
I launched my first nuke a month ago and same. I had my server crash on me :(
---
Found me, eh? Lol
---
The best names are when a persons account bugs out and displays their public IPv6 address instead of their username. Still waiting on a response from BGS on that one... kind of a big security risk.
---
‚ÄúGet fucked‚Äù -driver nephi
---
!!!!!
---
Even with the one you had I still am having issues :(
---
For be honest, I hope they improved environmentals so why they mentioned it specially. And, yeah we will test it. Until that, we must accept it as mentioned in patch notes.
---
But is I said, we can still have bugs about it, we will see in game. Just point is, how it will work in v7.5 as mentioned.
---
It would be cool if you could set them as Wandering Merchants (with a few waypoints to mark their route) so they could sell goods while you're playing
---
People can trick people into joining a survival mode server.
---
They should also make the mushroom cloud visible from long distances on the map! 
---
Exactly. The caps are what the whole thing boils down to. 
---
I‚Äôkk invite you now 
---
"Hair of the dog that bit you" is a wastelander's favorite hangover cure.
---
It should be fresh start for all but in 2 weeks you can turn migrate your characters from adventure to survival 
---
I can't believe how many people I've traded with that have a full set. Seems legit?
---
Todd probobly bankrupt them all before he turns it back on. Double pay for todd
---
&gt; Makes making a musical tone based puzzle far more arduous
---
I think that the vast majority of us are familiar with this specific issue from first-hand experience, yes. 
---
One time, I was attacked by a player after a Queen run. I killed him and got what I felt like ‚Äúfree‚Äù stable flux because he was much easier to kill than the queen. I‚Äôve been killing people for caps and junk ever since. Rarely do I have to farm junk in the open world, except that dang coal!
---
Confirmed PC is up
---
The brand ? BoS vs meh..
---
I had this idea.. Maybe we were supposed to let the Mega Sloth live and protect it from the wolves and blood bugs that come...
---
Oh candy! 
---
Whats New in the shop
---
I play legit. I haven't been banned. I have a full time job. I play a lot of Fallout 76. I could easily make 100K ultracite .50 cal ammo. I've already made 50K in a month. I didn't make more because I just had no need of more. Certain types of ammo, yes I'd agree. But .50 Cal or 5mm it's easily attainable, even if you have a full time job. For someone like Glorf who plays 12-14 hours per day and knows every trick that I do and more, it would be trivial.
---
1. Trade in adventure mode only. If you are stupid enough to trade in survival you kind of deserve to die.
---
2. Aren't weapons still normalized for pvp?
---
3. You don't show up on the map so they will have to find you first which will be hard.
---
4. Can you explain a bit better for this cat and mouse perk card builds?
---
5. Yes grouping up is a feature. I see no problem here.
---
6. How will it be abused? It costs 200 caps to put a bounty on someone. That's an entire vendors caps for a day.
---
Don't you worry, I'll still come back to contest your workshop until you leave.
---
Yeah and then you have to consider many people will be teamed up. I was quite excited but,as a solo player,even with godly armor and guns,i don't feel it's worth.
---
Roughly how many people would you say attend? Apologies in advance if it was mentioned it in the video
---
Guys, he spent a lot of time building it just the way he likes it. We are clearly in the wrong. 
---
Where did it say 300 caps on death?
---
You put out a 3000 cap bounty on me after I blow out the back of your head from the next Hill top. I then turn to my melee friend with me and bow my head awaiting a quick death. I respawn and my friend gives me back my dropped loot and half or so of the bounty caps you just gave us on top of the caps I already received for your head shot.
---
"That's my secret, I'm always drunk." ;)
---
Sounds like easy targets.
---
Should be up now, just let me in on XB1
---
Yeah kind of dumb to put bounties. It can be very fun to watch though with ass/sentinel then watch him rotorooter all the takers.
---
Just one of many :) It‚Äôs set to a hidden pressure plate and floor trap under an actual floor piece and not a roof :) wanted to try the ‚ÄúJug‚Äù haha
---
I have to get on top of the house? This is a crazy bar
---
I like to stand over my victim and take a picture, I'll upload them later lol. A lower level picked the lock on my purifier the other day... So I fired him.
---
I steal, I'll take junk and make them capless wihh mass murder. Then junk I don't want I drop where they won't find it...
---
I'll kill their brahmin and blow up all workshop/camp items that cost to rebuild, for example their decontamination arch.
---
No level or build is safe. Ask around, I'm solo and just don't give a fuck.
---
I'll take your workshop and mark your location and hunt you down, now that I get a raging hard on. 80% of the time, the victim is at a workbench in his/her camp going by their business and bang, your junk is now mine lol and you dignity.
---
I stay though but before they respawn I've stored all your good shit and hid the rest..
---
Then I kill, kill, kill!!
---
This will get peoples back up but this is a wasteland, I'm just trying to make shit real... I am Survival mode.
---
Note: this is a game and I'm a dad, yeh I don't play by all the rules but I don't exploit the game, cheat the system, neither do I condone it. So before you label me a cunt I'm just having some fun while the kids are asleep, the missus isn't on my back about some shit and I'm relaxed.
---
Although now I leave my camp open to everyone but don't trust me, honestly I will kill you.. Or at least try.
---
A tip for new players if someone locks you in there camp, or drops you down a hatch then don't attack or break something to get out, fast travel. This even works when some prick tries flinging you off a mountain. Remember that. 
---
Thanks for speaking for all of us, Lorax
---
Old-school hit squad team sounds fun to me...
---
I do not recall seeing one.
---
Well,  I mean I already have the golden 44 and the gilded lever action,  may as well get the golden dagger:
---
So Stimpack spamming is still possible in adventure mode PVP?
---
I'm sorry but you just don't know how to play dude. You're all bad and inefficient at this game. It's easily possible. Not even 900 hours. Nowehere near that is required to make 100K .50 cal or 5mm ultracite ammo.
---
The atomic shop is broken though for me. 
---
You have Nooo idea 
---
Really not trying to troll. Commenting mostly at random because there is such a response i cant keep up on my phone. See this is a helpful response. Most people are just rude on the internet. 
---
Speak for yourself dude.  There is no generalized "we". This game has a fairly large user base that is getting larger as people slowly come back to it now that it is a little more stable. If it's not for you, fine. No one is forcing you to play it. It sucks for you that it seems Bethesda is committed to supporting this game long term, but a lot of us here think that's awesome.
---
I love this game and will 100% try out the new mode. And I like that I can keep the stuff I worked hard to find and buy before this. I just think that the cap penalty is too steep. 
---
I'd be totally fine with that but it should only be a one way ticket for that character.
---
I believe he arrived with it, it was not from that run.
---
You should see if you can get a 3d print of a protecteron for her. Bonus points if it has a mask! 
---
Straight white American male 6‚Äô in height and under 200lbs
---
YASSSS! Cause otherwise people can start being jerks with 0 consequences, such as a turret base by white springs
---
We were the evil this whole time :o
---
I plan on starting fresh and hope that I can charm my way out of shitty situations. I don't keep much junk on me it mostly stays at my camp. As of for aid and more caps if people use it as a kinda like death match "I'm gonna shoot this guy cause he just so happens to be in my server" then I'll just delete that character and stick to adventure. My biggest fear is that this is gonna turn into fallout battle Royale where people will just be killing people just to kill people.
---
Sure your kid named them üòÇüòâ
---
I'm going to look into the Appalachian Guardians a poster mentioned further down, just FYI. Might be what we're looking for. 
---
I thought you meant "traps" for a second then... *sigh* I really need to get out more. 
---
i couldn't find your account on the ps it said o players found
---
Lets go boys and girls
---
Me too! Came here to see if anyone else was experiencing this. I knew I should have gotten that sweet Old Oppossum light when I had the chance. 
---
Except you've had x amount more time to tweak and change your perk/gear build, and farm better gear....
---
 Alright! I'm in central time zone US and generally play in the evenings. 
---
Wendigos are no joke
---
You can create other characters, I have two at the moment....unless there's a cap on how many you can create
---
They should make a turn my camp off button in survival mode and add a new camp called T.E.N.T which is a smaller version of Camp. Only 1 of the 2 can be active a at time.
---
No problem at all man. Yeah same here! I really hope Bethesda implements armor/clothing/more weapons from previous Fallout games, I would definitely be happy. The M16/Service Rifle is one of my favorite weapons to use. Even though I'm pure Brotherhood of Steel to the core I've always liked the M series weapons. I guess I've been reading up/watching a lot of Fallout Tactics lately. 
---
But I digress: I'm currently 2nd in command of the 'Eastern Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel' (Xbox only) Discord group (Sentinel. Would've been General but I turned that down because one of the members is a former U.S. Marine so when he's ready he'll be 2nd in command instead, we have an Inquisitor (Basically our Military Police detachment) who's a current severing U.S. Marine. Whole group is semi serous, I like how it is currently, we're about to have squads implemented into the group.
---
If any Xbox players wish to join up I'll gladly sponsor your entry into the group, just at least be serious about the Brotherhood and we'll be just fine.
---
I feel like some of these guys should still exist in the world/Helvetia.
---
A lot were just pissed off that Fo76 isn't a typical Fallout game and were unwilling or unable to take the game on its own merits.
---
I have a trap base here with turrets set up with the sole purpose of triggering people so they jump down in to it.
---
The really good gear ya have to pay out the arse in caps for. Never heard of someone getting assassin's sent armor off a drop but someone had to get a drop for it to be in the game right. Everyone that has it now paid for it. 
---
That was only because of pve and before survival mode.
---
No pvp on adventure if either party is pacifists..
---
You should try deathmatch games and battle Royale games then.  Those are built to be arena typed balanced games.  Where as role playing games, by contrast, are game you take on the role of a character who's skills are represented by the experience he has attained and the new levels of skill that provides him. So even if youre an MMA fighter in real life, your character may not be.  Welcome to the magical world of dungeons and dragons, a much different game than the balanced gameplay of candyland, shoots and ladders, and quake 3.  
---
Hey it was a good design. Easy on the eyes. Lol now I am trolling. I wasnt before.
---
Seems like they‚Äôre back online if you updated just restart your console 
---
I added you I think

That's odd, I've had no problems (PC) with it.  It was the only way I knew to look for the hidden door, I could hear him from upstairs...
---
Yeah. Me too.
---
But we *can* know, now, with zero speculation. Count your aid items and go get killed! 
---
Any mutations?
---
I may have done that on purpose lulz ;) 
---
Is the atomic shop just displaying things you already purchased? Everything else is missing for me. 
---
Same with diamond eyes
---
Could be but why talk hate about a game you don‚Äôt own or play? Was my question.
---
I like
---
None/none
---
I think we will take out wanted people and threats to the wasteland too
---
I had 1230. They're now showing 0.
---
Unless they tweak it so this is actually pvp and not getting one shotted without any chance of actually fighting then I'll just stick to adventure and maybe pop in if a server is empty or something. Might just wait until the legendary drops make their way to the marketplace too. 
---
A better title would be, let's be honest everyone but you and a few pve players dont want to be able to hope back and forth. 
---
The real problem I've found is, I've already been killed three times by people blatantly cheating. One shot kills through walls while immune to damage. One even bragged about using the cheat from (a paid cheat site) because "Bethesda won't do shit, haha die faggot"
---
I can't see survival even being playable until these people get bored.
---
Was this on pc?
---
Good question. I‚Äôd hope that it doesn‚Äôt but that the next time you play survival it appears again. Guess we shall see. 
---
Legendary or basic gauss rifle?
---
A bandaid on a gun shot wound. 
---
I'd love a large dark blank frame for placing the letters (neon and otherwise). Maybe roughly the size of the gas sign.
---
Plain old rifle?  No legendary effect?
---
Nah fam, they already showed us in the dlc roadmap that pve and more rpg mechanics are planned and probably being developed right now for future dlc, in the next months they are releasing 2 new questlines, later on we are getting the vault raids and the end of this year we are getting the wastelanders dlc that is supposed to integrate new dialogue options mechanics and meaningful choices...
---
So no the focus is not really changing to pvp content. BUT there could be another pvp mode comming, we don't really know anything about the nuclear winter mode yet so maybe and just maybe theres the possibility of a BR mode. But personally I think this new mode could be like a super hard mode like the survival mode of fo4.....
---
Only reason I see they might change something with the spawn is you can exploit the adventure mode fast travel. If you in the Ash Heap in Survival and need to get to the mire, players might just log into adventure mode and fast travel there, then switch back to survival. But, with train stations being on the list of possible spawn points, I don't see why you would need to do that.
---
Where do i sign up? 
---
Don‚Äôt stress, the update literally just went live. The shop came back up for me after relaunching the game. 
---
i save all my whiskey just to  make grape mentats
---
How are you seeing the shop? Mine and most of my friends is broken. 
---
Oh for sure I'm a Mac guy and only play on PS4 and didn't even think about PC users. I never game on my Mac because it just a design machine.
---
Going to keep my aid to 1 stimpack, if I can't kill someone after that then I deserve to die.
---
From a coding perspective with trades and stuff it is harder to do also easier to track dupes if they are all named the same
---
Griefing has happened to me, but it has been thankfully rare.  I think I have been arbitrarily killed with massive "slap" damage about three times since launch.  And yesterday I jumped servers because some nuisance player kept attacking me, preventing me from using a vendor.  
---
But for me, the vast majority of multiplayer interaction has been neutral (albeit immersion-disruptive).  Actual positive direct interactions have been about twice as frequent as negative ones for me.  Players mostly just ignore each other.  The most frequent interactions are indirect in the form of leaving unwanted loot in train station containers for someone who might want them, or scavenging the same from someone else's offering.  I enjoy running across player settlements and seeing what other people have build.  But the other player is rarely there, and  when they are the most I can really do is emote positively at them if their C.A.M.P. is cool.
---
So you do have the exact coordinates for each spawn point?
---
Not stressing, just making them aware :) but thanks, will rejoin
---
I do try and play them, i‚Äôve been playing Halo multiplayer since Halo 2 online days, i enjoy DayZ. I enjoy Ark, i also enjoy fallout and when an open world always online game has PvP, i expect to PvP, not to wait for permission to PvP, i enjoy the PvE aspect as i‚Äôve out over 200 hours in every BGS game standard.
---
I won‚Äôt enjoy this PvP where people have duped items and god builds. If the dupe economy wasn‚Äôt going to be involved in the survival mode, i would play it. 
---
Adventure and survival mode needs to be completely separate.
---
Well, I don't see a lot of people with Ass/Sent running around.
---
The only friends that I have with this set have bought it for real money on Ebay.
---
Most of the people that I play with have either a shotgun/stagger, bloodied or crit build.
---
We never had a problem with assassin/sentinel, but a lot of times a bloodied sniper kills us out of nowhere.
---
They can one-hit kill you with Vats, even if you are really far and pretty difficult to spot. The only counter is a Stealth Boy, and it's quite expensive.
---
The problem is that you only need a good 1* weapon to make a deadly bloodied build, and you can be lethal even at low level.
---
That's what I was thinking, too.  And good point about the train stations.  I hadn't considered that.
---
Same on Xbox. 
---
If you lock a character to survival servers, how would a player ever transfer items between characters? There wouldnt be a way would there?
---
Happens with AAE, TSE Prime... havent tried it with basic gauss, now that you mention it... 
---
And before someone asks, no armor 
---
Exact same story here dude, I was turned off by the bad beta and release day reactions, decided to give it a few months, Until I saw the game on sale on the ps store. 
---
But what really drove me to get in the game was the overflowing amount of posts like this on this reddit.  All of them saying that the community is one of the best.
---
I bought the game last weekend, and yes.  Not even an hour into the game, some random people were giving me free stuff, plans, weapons, stims... 
---
I‚Äôm only at lvl 18 now,  and I‚Äôve made a couple of trips to vault 76 whenever I see a newbie coming out of it, dropping a couple of plans, an old pipe rifle and some ammo. 
---
I misjudged this game as well, and I too am sorry. 
---
Im not sure what that means?
---
Reported many many times....   
---
The way they modify weapon weights based on weapon upgrades is a Multiply+Add, which is why 90% reduced weight weapons "break" when you start adding upgrades and they suddenly jump in weight by x5, x10, or x20 it's previous weight.     
---
Changing the mods to a fixed weight addition/subtraction, based on more realistic values would fix it...
---
My friends and I had the same problem. Got through the silo (the 3 of us were all like lvl 35 so it was a nightmare) and when we got to the last part realized we didn't have a code. I literally googled "What is this week's nuke code" and got the code and launched the nuke. Thanks google!
---
Wtb stealth boys, berry mentats and stims. 
---
Thats the list. Stock up and sell please!
---
I'm pretty sure you will not be able to accrue a bounty by destroying another player's CAMP in survival mode. If you can, that's what I'll be doing!
---
It seems the Shop is experiencing a temporary hiccup, we're looking into it!
---
I'm on ps4 and just got on about 10 minutes ago. Took a minute for the option to be available, but I can view it just fine.
---
Ps4 too
---
I can agree with this. I think it was a smart move to keep the drop rate so low that there was no way to guarantee getting a rare mask. It gives them real value. But this picture certainly set up the wrong expectaions.
---
We're investigating now!
---
Hol up. 
---
No one in this post is giving this man a happy cake day!!
---
I hope you have an amazing cake day good sir/ma‚Äôam.
---
Yeah, defo go through patches of nothing but stims and water. I've been grinding 2 sets of BOS paint since they dropped, not even half way yet. 1 to learn, 1 set I was going to gift to a friend, but quite frankly with the amount of effort I have put in, I'm keeping them. 
---
what
---
Doing pvp is the only challenge for high level players at the moment. If you are in a team of two it's even better. Try looking for these damn assassins sentinel pieces via trading and looting and get some good anti armor weapons. 
---
I dont think anyone has the right to call you anything if you dont exploit or cheat, if its your way of enjoying the game then by all means you should be free to do so
---
people are going to do it all the time by accident
---
It begins. The inevitable sobbing posts.
---
Actually it would be cool if they didn't show the nuke zone on the map at all. You can see the big brown cloud from miles away and that should be enough indicator.
---
I‚Äôm terrible at estimating, but if I had to guess, I‚Äôd say on average about 200. One year we had a huge snow storm and still about 100 showed up. I think 3 years ago was the biggest I‚Äôve seen, and it was probably close to 400. It was a good crowd this year, but I half expect next year to be pretty big. 
---
Helvetia is VERY small. The town fills up quickly. 
---
Pvp kill sounds like ticket to straight paid leaderboard 
---
That's what I'm talking about, see people. Already demand. That said y'all going to need bigger wallets. 
---
I dismantled my beautiful two-story with detached workshop yesterday as I can't stand the thought of someone destroying it in survival. If and when I retire from that mode, whether it's a year from now or by the end of the week, I'll rebuild. 
---
What
---
Thanks. Was excited to see some new stuff!
---
Okay. So nothing for me then. Swell. 
---
I'm at work and can't play, and I'm dying to know this (oops, poor word choice).  I actually prefer to have a possibility of losing ALL your aids.  Adding drama just works!
---
We're looking into this issue now. Thanks for your report!
---
I could get down with that.  More realistic.
---
Sadly I think the maximum is 5 per account right now.
---
Hey, thank you. Honestly. 
---
My thought was maybe it was something like bloodied or some other effect that would change damage based on HP.
---
Maybe if one of your shared perks is nerd rage and he's at a lower health?
---
Otherwise, SOMETHING has to be different between you two.
---
At least provide an option for new characters to be survival only and join worlds that are only those types of characters.
---
Let existing characters enjoy the new mode too, but give us a new character slot or option to make survival only new characters that only play with other survival only characters.
---
Win win for everyone if we had this option!
---
assuming someone wants to buy, or unless you are looking for something you need.
---
This is very true. At the very least, it should place a yellow circle of moderate size of where they are. That way it isn't a defining Mark of Death. More or less make these players crytids.
---
Lmao. Was my initial thought too. Not sure how people read why they type and think "yep. This conveys my thoughts perfectly"
---
Joined survival with level 2 character. 173lvl was waiting at vault 76. He found me even tho i runned away. New mode is purge, not survival.
---
The Shop seems to be having a momentary hiccup, we're looking into this now. Thanks for your report.
---
If they let you take only your player level across I would have been happy.
---
Spawn in naked cold and alone in survival with nothing but a knife. From there you just fend for your self. But you can use your level up points to gain a slight edge but you would need t o find all the gear again.
---
This is probably just me wanting a full respec. 
---
Wondering if that wild applachia backpack DLC in May will bring a camp tent and stove in addition to regular camping?
---
That‚Äôs really all I need I can use any crafting station while away 
---
AA has helped a lot of people and is obviously an important part of your recovery.  So I can understand wanting to preserve its integrity.
---
It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of appropriation of common sayings and icons when you have a strong attachment to an organization that has chosen to use them for their own purpose. 
---
It would be one thing if AA had coined the term ‚ÄúRock Bottom‚Äù and it was only used in that context.  However, that‚Äôs just not the case. 
---
So, I hope that you understand why there isn‚Äôt a lot of support for your position.  It‚Äôs nothing against AA or yourself, it‚Äôs just that the use of the term is generic.   
---
As for drinking in the game, as others have pointed out, you may as well complain about murder, drugs, etc.   it‚Äôs that type of game.  
---
If you feel that it‚Äôs too much, maybe another game would be more your style.   I‚Äôm not saying this to be mean, just to point out that you have a choice.  
---
Yes, this is at the top of my wishlist as far as items and cosmetics go
---
I think it would be cool to show it but to disable fast travel completely during the duration of the incoming nuke warning. That way people literally have to run for it if they're in the radius. Then after the nuke lands get rid of the map marker for it and just leave the dust cloud as the sole indicator that there's a nuke zone.
---
After only having tossed frag mines before, learning you can only throw 2 nuke mines was An eye opening experience
---
I scrapped everything in my elaborate home build and I'm just going mobile. I don't need nuthin but my race car bed and my tuba. And my mannequin with an alpine horn but THAT'S IT
---
You care enough to make a post. And if you did, many others will do the same. 
---
Who ever makes a new character deserves it. Obviously prople would camp noobs for no reason
---
It's for game balance not realism. Heavy guns are ass and you have to spend a ton of ammo to get the same results as a round or 2 from a rifle. Rifles also have the benefit of all of their stats being in perception so they have more options for the rest of their build where as heavy guns have stats in strength, intelligence, and luck. I'd like a new perk for rifles and shotguns though because you are right they are heavy as fuck. 
---
I would love this. 
---
I just need a campfire, a tent, a bed, and a banjo. 
---
No need to thank me dude, you bought the game, you spent money and time on it, play your way, screw the people that might bitch about you, anything goes as long as its in the rules set by the game.
---
Plus you and others like you make the game tjat much more alive and immersive for me, not everyone in the world is or should be a good samaritan.
---
that would be so nice of you :'D my psn is octopaca  
---
i cant play today tho
---
Yes, the gaming journalist who copy games reviews from youtubers like the IGN or the ones who say a game is the very best when their pockets grow later to see how shitty the game was indeed. Gaming press is very very bad and reviewers that are trustful are the ones who make performance reviews like Digital Foundry and some more. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing they probably tested this and a kills-based leaderboard puts too much of a focus on killing and takes focus away from everything else. 
---
I like it this way. If it were a kill based leaderboard the only way to get to the top would be to kill. But the way it is allows almost any play-style get to the top, all you have to do is SURVIVE. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget, this mode has less pvp restrictions but it is NOT a pvp mode. It‚Äôs SURVIVAL mode. Being a murderous psychopath is not necessary to having fun in survival mode. 
---
Good idea
---
it's actually the tricentennial paint. blackbird doesn't have the gold or the circle of stars.
---
We're looking into this issue now, thanks for the report!
---
I saw this exact same thing one morning last weekend.  I logged in, and as soon as my character was in the game I heard the nuke launch warning.  Checked my map and it was at the very NW corner of the map centered at WV Lumber Co.  I thought "odd place to nuke."  So I just ignored it.  Then a few moments later I opened my map to fast travel once my CAMP fully loaded and the Nuke zone indicator had moved down to Fissure Prime.
---
I went there and we killed the SBQ (quickly too).  It was a nice bonus for just logging in that morning.
---
Seems that when the game isn't fully loaded the Nuke Zone indicator of a currently launched Nuke doesn't load on the correct location either, must default to the NW corner of the map, some "0,0" time thing?
---
This is trolling, right? No one can be this dense. 
---
wow why would pacifist even be an option in survival lol
---
Id say the biggest issue to the 1 shot was the fact that power armor does absolutely nothing to mitigate PvP damage.  When you get hit, you take damage as a buttnaked player.  
---
Have de-equipped everything and then re-equipped only what we had in common.  (All the riflemen and demolition)
---
I am a few levels higher but that's the only thing I can think of.
---
Is it possible extra perception or something from underarmor does something to that?  AFAIK, special didn't affect weapon damage.
---
Which is exactly the reason I won‚Äôt be venturing into survival mode.  And for the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs always a counter‚Äù crowd save it.  The counter is eliminating all duped weapons and armor once and for all.  
---
This happened to me yesterday. I was very confused to what was happening. Took a second realize he was using a stealth.  Went from demolishing him to him getting me.
---
They nerfed scorchbeasts. It used to be fun, could still take on 3 at a time with my build but they'd at least hit you with a steady scream that made it hard to see sometimes. Got staggered quite a bit too even in stealth. Now they're just flying gimps for whatever reason, bethesda decided they were op. The queen got a buff though, that was nice. The rage on here was funny, guys screaming she's invulnerable.
---
Breaking news! Level 2 characters are not the best!
---
Tonight at 9, is pork actually dangerous for rad toads?
---
Does pacifist mode actually prevent you from doing damage in survival? that should get fixed
---
Then... don't play Adventure mode?
---
Not sure why you are complaining.
---
Same
---
Are you getting on?
---
Servers are live, and a nice TS Dragon is waiting for you!
---
Awesome. Despite the huge outcry they went ahead and allowed existing characters.
---
Just another reminder that the studio under Bethesda that is working on this game has experience in Battle Royal games, not rpg's like fallout.
---
u/Skuure did the even once, got the Old Man Winter mask, and scrapped it for nothing because it was taking up an inventory slot XD
---
There are radio stations and transmitters everywhere you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be able to stream a song or message on those, while in game
---
My atoms are gone and my friend list has gone empty, is there any connection?
---
&gt;If someone wants to put in that amount of effort to kill someone, that's on them
---
It takes very little effort, and if the person who claimed the workshop is level 100+ it's easy caps for 30 seconds of stalking them.
---
I like it.

@ grafton steel, if critters are attacking your camp, you are too far down the hill.
---
Move a layer or two higher; your camp will rarely be attacked by game critters, with or without a scarecrow.
---
If you fence it, most critters that appear will usually just bounce along the fence until they fall off the cliff.
---
I had a camp way north, for a couple of weeks.  
---
It was just to the west of the alligator.  For the time I was there, no attacks, but I didnt spend much time in camp, either. 
---
Now that I think about it, I still don't...I haven't been back to my camp in at least 3 weeks, possibly longer.
---
It's all over but the grind
---
Why is there fast travel in a survival mode. I don't think you guys understand survival 
---
It‚Äôs over, already ??   I was doing my third one the other day and my game crashed right in the middle.  I ended up only doing it twice..   
---
I did get a doughnut recipe, though.   So at least I got that...
---
Maintenance is over get your patches 
---
Free Fast Travels.
---
I'm not complaining, I'm asking what's the point of survival mode over everything else people wanted?
---
And your choosing to ignore those who made their gear collection legit, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see a post from you complaining about weapons, wether legitimate or not, killing you over and over again. The sad truth is yes, the dupe and dev room happened, and if it happened when survival came out, what then? A reset? People would gain what they had, by chance or by trade, and we will do a full circle. The even playing field proposed by this silly reset will last maybe a week before the more dedicated players over level everyone and therefore create a bigger epidemic. I choose to defend the ability to bring my geared character to this new mode as those joining this new mode will most likely be where I am in terms of experience. If you think this gives newer players no fair playing field, you are wrong and that‚Äôs where the glory of the interchangeable game modes is. They can start in Adventure mode to get where the higher levels are then join the fun in Survival. 
---
Maybe if they put information pertinent to Adventure Server players in the patch notes relating to the Adventure Server, those of us who don't care about PVP can go back to skimming over the PVP parts of the patch notes without having to scour them for errant piece of information that we need to know about.  
---
Ok, maybe I should've read the entire notes more carefully before asking, but by the 30th bullet point of information about a PVP mode I'm not interested in, I admit I wasn't paying much attention :p
---
So you can get attacked when you go to meet them?
---
- Raises a nukashine and ends up waking up between two deathclaws-
---
Tank Killer is only for rifles 
---
Make you their "friends" so they can see you on the map.
---
I dunno~ Congenital Stupidity?
---
Free teleport point, they want to be in the area your in but don't want to pay the fast travel caps to do so
---
Can confirm logging out and back in fixes this.
---
Had the same exact thing happen to me.
---
I'm always confused when I get one as soon as I enter the world... 
---
I noticed the pacifist message when I shot at the first guy. Yea I was surprised myself.
---
Damn, not a good way to start after the new patch. How is the game play?
---
Unyielding cavalier 
---
Awww yeeeeeeah
---
I said several times I wasn‚Äôt trolling. Guess that makes me sound even more like a troll. Maybe we will never know.
---
Everyone knows taking a workshop means someone else can come and take it from you. Claiming a workshop does not mean that someone can come and cap you at your camp. 
---
Loll
---
"alts"
---
Deep pockets my friend, deep pockets. You can gain +50 carry weight with just that. Throw in through hiker and  scattershot along with traveling pharmacy or bandolier and voila! 
---
Both, they make the same with the same results the only difference is that journalist wait until some youtuber has managed to start a hate rage against a game to later join and rape the game up without even making a fair analysis of the game in question, because they know that if they talk good about that game they will get the hate and if they talk shit they will get the views that keep them alive.
---
People still play this game?
---
Man that sounds amazing.
---
How long would the update take on Xbox 
---
That‚Äôs interesting!
---
I came here to say the same. I (lvl 7) just tried and got mauled by lvl 230 player. Not a change when my weapons are baseball bat and two pipe weapons when he had some sci-fi weapon i have never even seen before. Not fair there is gods amongst the vault dwellers.
---
It's been ram raided by virtual robbers
---
Not sure. I forgot to remove it and saw the message. Not sure how much damaged I did. I ran and hid after seeing the message.
---
Can you link me to these magical headphones that will restore my hearing? I don't know how I missed them!
---
If you really want to be sure, unequip everything so it's JUST the gun itself with no modifiers.
---
See if it starts as equal.
---
oh, maybe I should turn subs on
---
UGH UGH UGH - it is back to green for me. :(
---
Ha, ok!
---
Yes im online now
---
It should be called "pussifist" mode and default to off.
---
Not just that, but the 90% weight reduction? Yeah, it doesn't reduce weight by 90%. I still have guns that weight 10lbs+. So if their weight was reduced by 90% that's, what, a 100lbs gun?
---
Oh boy, maybe they should have kept the no PvP until lvl5 thing
---
tl:dr
---
"I spent a lot on paypal and god dammit I'm going to get my money's worth"
---
May I come to your camp and make a blueprint out of this? If you‚Äôre on PC? This is very technical, otherwise maybe a video or screenshots step by step? Sorry to bother you with this :)
---
The problem with bloodied builds is that they are easily countered, while some some assassin sentinel guy is all around protected. For example I can easily take out any bloodied guy with my anti armor gamma cannon. The build is really fun, but has some serious downsights. 
---
Can you buy anything? I just did the same, but when trying to buy the free emote I got an error
---
Can you roll it back to a previous version?
---
I‚Äôm on asus astrix lets me install either production or overclocked unstable 
---
Yeah so my question is why don't you accept my dang invites! &gt;_&lt;
---
That's good enough for now, but mod's kinda break every patch. Something official would be nice
---
I like the idea of being able to upgrade the turrets, with a levelling system which shows health/damage/range etc. I definitely agree, turrets are pointless, and I barely ever use them anymore at my camp. And my character can just stand there taking hits of multiply turrets without hardly any effect , non PA.
---
Your ignorance shows I‚Äôm right.
---
I think I'll stick to that myself. Tried it out already and I'm happy with it as is. :)
---
You‚Äôre that guy who keeps posting saying pvp is balanced lol. What did you expect?
---
That NW corner is some kind of default position. I have seen this as well.
---
Few reasons. An alt that wants to unlock the map for vendors trading. Broke folks who are too cheap to fast travel. Kids who want you to carry them. Your by a map poi and it's a hover miss click.
---
Maybe. Maybe they should focus on pve, but ppl here wanted battlefield76. Haha
---
Pretty sure I added you, my IGN is Gopnikmeister.
---
Shit I wanted to ask if crouching hid you while you were top or not.  (On map)
---
I'm also on PC, I could also hear him from upstairs but for some reason he's basically the same volume from upstairs as standing right in front of him.
---
Are these the challenges that give legendary rewards??
---
Either free fast travels close to where they want to go.
---
Or if it's a mile some or high rad area it could be to share Rad Sponge. 
---
Wicked burn. 
---
The only thing i dislike is that people who dont necessarily want to fight are forced to be marked, and those who fight a lot dont really have a method to have people come to you other than bounties. The leaderboard is just for bragging rights, so if its gonna have an in game effect like being marked, that should be to encourage pvp for people who want to pvp.

---
It went away a lot because of people getting fed up with it and going sniper to counter. It will come back without an effective counter, or everyone will go shotgun/stagger. I hope I am wrong, but the way the patch notes worded things...
---
The glow mods have been rock solid since release. Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to work.
---
Armor doesn't matter. Armor penetration allows you to mitigate 99% of it no matter how big the number is. It's not a straight forward 99% reduction because of how damage mitigation actually works but  when a player is doing a ton of damage and has armor penetration, it doesn't matter what your armor resistance is.
---
they are cheap f*cks trying to get a fast travel 
---
Bethesda has already replied about that here.  Atomic Shop is having a hiccup.
---
Meh, 5 steel and a few gears to repair all.  :p
---
In five minutes my junk harvester gets enough crap to repair my entire camp.  Scorchbeast just got it yesterday lol
---
PS4 here, can confirm presence of visual plasma being released from weapon. 
---
PA suppose to be able to take tank rounds, full machine fire at close range and all those things but a power fist to smash concrete walls can‚Äôt completely trash it. Fun. PA should be like driving a car. Protection for what it‚Äôs supposed to stop and require a heavier drain on its fusion core.  Mad that you run out of power that‚Äôs the point it‚Äôs tradeoff.

They have tons of brands they could do things with:
---
Chryslus Motors (Corvega), Poseidon Energy, BlamCo, General Atomics, Med-Tek, Radiation King, Wilson Atomitoys, Watts! Electric,  Robco, Snap-Off Tools, Wes-tech and tons more... the IP has a lot of depth - they just need to start using it.
---
This is just short of what I would have guessed (500), so it will be interesting to see just how many more end up attending for the next celebration due to fo76 and fasnacht getting more search queries
---
Ye thats me, i would take my main but don't want lose 400caps each death and superstimpacks which i cant store in that small stash haha.
---
It would be ok, if he didn't see me on map. There is not even 5lvls protection. Old days pvp was good. This is not good. I am hoping someone make video to show if it is doable withou loosing all you shit.
---
It‚Äôs only concerns and predictions of what could happen. 
---
I would like to piggy back off of this and ask for a "LoL" emote please
---
I like it!
---
Yay!  Thank you for the reply!  I‚Äôm on PC, but I‚Äôm sure if it‚Äôs fixed on one it‚Äôll be taken care of for the rest.
---
[We know about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5s6j4/what_is_the_free_pvp_emote_i_cant_find_it_also/ejfhm6k/)
---
Not sure. Ran like a punk to turn it off.
---
Thanks again bro
---
Good. I'm glad they did all that. Move your camp
---
I have had this happen to me so many times. I think it is to get free fast travel so I always just ignore it. EITHER WALK OR PAY CAPS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE YOU STINGY PILES OF SCORCHBEAST GUANA!
---
u/Valseek u/BethesdaGameStudios u/LadyDevann u/LoneVaultWanderer Really sorry for the tag but I'm genuinely curious as to what is the purpose of never adding the numbers to balance changes? Why not putting them if every other online game does? Why if either way dataminers are going to tell us? Not wanna do negative speculation but this truly suggest a complete lack of communication between the community maganers and the dev team, please correct me if I'm wrong but the only reason I can logically come up with for not adding the raw balance changes is that you don't even know them. Apart from that, nice job and really looking forward to play this game mode.
---
The leaderboard doesnt really mean anything though. If someone pays hundreds or thousands of caps to get bragging rights, so what? I'd rather have a good system that helps pvpers pvp and people who dont want to pvp avoid it
---
The Atomic shop has a temporary outage right now but will be back up ASAP!
---
Agreed. Inspired by the legendary\* [Fairbairn‚ÄìSykes fighting knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbairn%E2%80%93Sykes_fighting_knife).
---
\*lower case 'L'
---
The shop itself is just showing me my already-purchased items, I'm leaving it alone till they figure it out.  Just wanted to quickly post that the ATOM loss was visual, not an account error, before people freaked about losing thousands of ATOM.
---
When the bug list is as long as the patch notes
---
Hopefully that‚Äôs the case! No problem
---
Yeah that works too.
---
[Per Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16), standard weight for an AK-47 with 30-round clip is 10.5 lbs. In-game version has a shovel handle rather than a full wood stock, too. As for "cheaper than a proper russian made", IRL I ride a Ural (Russian motorcycle) and for spare parts tend to go with Chang Jiang parts because the Chinese knockoffs are lighter and more durable than the genuine Russian articles. I'd expect a Russian-made AK-47 to blow up in my face long before its Chinese counterpart.
---
Go on, hopefuly there wont be pvp zone lol.
---
Kill 25 legendaries.
---
Hopefully that‚Äôs the case! No problem 
---
Someone actually tested it and said they did work in fallout 76
---
As a hearing impaired player, I would absolutely love this. Same with the other locator perks. It took me weeks to identify the noise among all the other sounds in the game world. 
---
Yeah, I know it is legal... just can't believe things like this are allowed. We reserve the right to change this contract, without consent, post agreement? Sad it's not balked at. 
---
1 of each type right? Plus nuka colas?
---
Did not work. Someone found me when I was at the top spot. I was crouching thinking the same thing.
---
indiana jones can attest to this
---
Nope
---
[PS4] finding 5thickles is egouth challenge i am not gonna do it, so they see, it is stupid.
---
Someone tried this and it seemed that it work, it's probably on the top post of all time of this sub
---
Unfortunately at this time, end game content doesn't really exist. Some friends and I are all in the upper level 100's, and we basically just go around killing random things and farming random items. The most "difficult" part you'll find is doing SBQ. They did announce that in the future, there will be end game "vaults" players can que into, I think that's the plan for end game content. However, your best bet is going to be farming White Springs and SBQ for any kind of remotely challenging atmosphere. 
---
Have they verified that the duping bug has been fixed?
---
There have been instances where someone out did the stim and killed before it can heal fully. 
---
Woah... Look out everybody, we've got a tough guy on the internet!!
---
But it‚Äôs DOUBLED caps which is a problem. I work hard to do quests and trading for caps.
---
I thought scissors was what you did when you didn‚Äôt have the equipment to screw?
---
Oooh I can‚Äôt wait till my shop works so I can see the new outfit!
---
I believe it said "until" the 26th, not "thru" the 26th. I believe that's where the confusion lies
---
They want more than ten people to actually play it. You are in a severe minority here. Not having some form of fast travel is a pain in the ass. 
---
&gt;Completely agree that this is absurd. My preferred build is rifleman based but with no ability to reduce the weight of this class of weapons I now only carry the lever gun and tesla rifle. I have instead adopted heavy guns who's perk card options allow me to carry a ridiculous number of alternatives. Do I wish BGS would nerf heavies? Absolutely not, but I would welcome some options for the rifle class. And while BGS is fixing such obviously unbalanced weapon class issues could we finally fix hand guns (and frankly energy too)? Make them competitive at long last?
---
What is a unruly golfer? I assume it is a ghoul.
---
Hope fully those cheaters get seperate Servers with only other cheaters 
---
Ah. Well. If you see someone named Knight\_Wanderer in power armor... attack at your own risk =). I have a blockers melee weapon and reactive plates. Not sure how / if that stacks but... seems legit.
---
Im pretty sure it doesn't man.... When i get into fights for workshops, I can take multiple hits when im outside of my powerarmor, but get 1 shot when im in it.   
---
Find a friend, test this out.  
---
If anything it‚Äôs a stealth fix and it doesn‚Äôt matter really as someone will find another backdoor and start it up again. 
---
Pedo Bear Approved?
---
I HAVE noticed though there are some subtle audio cues to drinking different alcohols, like moonshine and New River Ale have sounds attached to drinking. Small detail, but nice when it's there! 
---
What the hell is that thing? I've never seen it before üò≥
---
yeah but this gives Bethesda the wrong ideas...soon they'll announce the only five-star legendaries to be exclusive to PvP or whatever
---
Contractor super nice, I build lots of stuff all the time.
---
Vats is a big drain on power cores.
---
Gives an audio cue for nearby cap stashes that gets louder the closer you get to it 
---
Thank you for the info.
---
I‚Äôm a fairly casual player only going to be playing like 3-4 hours per session tops. Even if I never die once, I‚Äôd be surprised if I broke the top 3. 
---
Seems like addictions should persist until you take addictol also, mine just disappear after time.
---
Why are you being such a dick? Their just asking for a little preview?
---
Instead of working on the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of suggestions of new, current and former Fallout players, you have been deaf to all and went down the same road that led to 76's demise.   
---
SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO YOUR FANBASE! HARDLY ANYONE WAS HOPING FOR ENHANCED PVP.
---
If I want to play PVP I'll go play Call of Duty or something.....
---
To be Frank, Stop bitching. Sounds like if you wanna be a badass with all your weapons you need to wager more. While if you make a lvl 10 player you'll lose less. I'm sure there is a mention to it
---
I'm sure it was planned. It also didn't change anything in the event as I expected it to. The frogs spawned, the mutants spawned then the robots just turned around and walked back up the street toward the bonfire. They all died and we did fail the event but that wasn't because they were blocked, only because no-one killed the final spawns.
---
The survive statue looks awesome!
---
People can trick other people into joining a survival mode server and straight up kill them for their caps and then leave.
---
&gt; in Pvp mode losing junk, aid and caps.. 
---
To other players?
---
After the other FO games where we'd lay massive mine fields it's taken some adjustment.
---
I totally get why there's a 2 mine limited though.
---
I just noticed that googling "protecteron toy" brings up a bunch of cool results. Too bad none of them talk. That's her favorite part
---
You need to get trading.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have the best servers, but I‚Äôve only been disconnected maybe 5-7 times in all the time I‚Äôve played fallout 76. I‚Äôve been disconnected 7-10 times from apex legends, and I was getting 4-8 disconnects even in the days of black ops 1 and stuff like that. I get disconnected (some error that brings me to the menu) from subnautica and that‚Äôs not even an online game. I‚Äôm just saying that if you‚Äôve had a lot more disconnects than me I feel for you, but if you‚Äôre getting similar amounts of disconnects to me and the other people here then there‚Äôs a chance it might be on you. Getting disconnected once a week or so really is not uncommon for any developer. 
---
I could go on and on about online games that I‚Äôve been disconnected from probably 10+ times, I don‚Äôt think fo76 is as bad in that regard as most people say. 
---
It‚Äôs up but atom store not working yet.
---
Same here.  Tried compatability mode, using software rendering, and that old launcher - even reinstalling from the launcher, from the uninstalled, and registry cleaning the previous install.
---
thanks
---
Yea, I started doing the opposite.  Climb out of the power armor, and I am able to live much longer. 
---
Hey, where did you get the nuclear key card required to enter the launch code? Thanks. 
---
I'm seeing the same thing. Atomic shop is only displaying items I own. 
---
Mind explaining this?
---
Then don't expect any changes soon.
---
3.69 GB, connection speed etc. will determine time.
---
That‚Äôs because you can utilize perks that add insane DR and you can also utilize legendary armor effects that will bolster your survivability. 
---
PA has none of these things, just flat numbers. If your DR is 400 in PA and the other guy uses Incisor, it just dropped to 100 because it‚Äôs armor. 
---
Incisor doesn‚Äôt effect perks like barbarian, because barbarian isn‚Äôt armor. It‚Äôs simply an inherent DR. 
---
OH GOD YES ! Finaly a name attached to it and a way to find note sheets for it. 
---
Thanks alot n.n
---
Ah, odd.  Well it's still beta and maybe it's better that way. Too early to tell.
---
Quick question: is there supposed to be a respawn immunity in survival mode, because i keep getting spawn camped and losing all my caps as soon as i spawn from the same guy
---
God of bullets2 if you want the gamertag 
---
Not really
---
My experiences of new mode is dying to people 30 - 70 levels higher than me why? Probably because they suck and want to take all my junk and aid. 
---
The one with the chainsaw, not the machete, Jason has a machete :p
---
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the movie series called,
---
I bought the game, and hate played because I felt "If I can't get a refund, I my as well get my money's worth." And over time I found I grew to (mostly) like it. There's still a lot of issues with the game, especially the end game, but it's improved overall and is in a fairly good place now.
---
I wish that it would have fixed the cockeyed door.  I just want to go up and bang it closed 
---
Got mine from a paper bag! Thanks stranger 
---
I'm not sure you'd lose any caps if you never returned fire, only the initiate would chance the caps. I could be wrong. Also, where did you get that caps awarded are based on player level? I've only ever seen a wanted meter and that number steadily increase based on dammge he's done.
---
Unless there was a change recently, I can confirm that Pulowski shelters do NOT work. All it does is leave a paper bag with your junk on top of the pile of goo that you get turned into.
---
Thanks for the feedback!  )
---
what's the point when you can just fast travel to 76 or server hop?
---
i don't get this community ...
---
instead of reducing the amount of server hop conditions they want to add more and more and more and ...
---
Sometimes it's an accident, other times they want a free fast travel hop.
---
I also have this bug, I'm on ps4
---
Read some of the comments. I even replied to a few.  Also these are just concerns and predictions.
---
* [Comment by CM_PipBoy](/r/fo76/comments/b5sdw7/atomic_shop_not_working/ejfiti5/?context=1000 "posted on 2019-03-26 17:18:42 UTC"):
---
 &gt; The Atomic Shop is experiencing a temporary outage and will be back up ASAP.
---
In all honesty I would have liked to collect them but at the end of the day they'd just sit in my stash talking up .10 weight. I'd be more upset if the plans were the rare items.
---
But you might want to wait a bit until the survival server calms down a bit. Right now there are way too many people online. I can't think of any safe places to farm those 25 legendary mobs at the moment
---
Yeah...it's my camp dream...patrolling robot...i want!!!
---
Try reading a radio play... :/
---
Hey there, [please file a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for this.
---
I gotta try this. 
---
Go play Apex Legends or whatever. Fallout 76's core elements and design hasn't changed. If you didn't like the BETA you won't like it now. You're a sucker for "listening" to reviews when you should have known media (whether it's mainstream or YTers) are just in it for the shock value and subs/views. You're a doubler sucker for thinking it's different now that in the BETA.
---
People can invite you to a survival game jsut to trick you and then kill you for your caps then leave.
---
Pyramid with only a water entrance, that can be sealed off....Nope, my camp will not be destroyed. You cannot swim and shoot at the same time......
---
I completely agree. The only thing we get is a week at best of over stated builds not lording over others. The market is still teeming with over saturated and over inflated goods. Weapons and armour  builds are a hot mess. 
---
The end of this post actually made me mad
---
&gt; 5thickles is egouth
---
ow...
---
where did you get it from? and it's a plan, not a mod?
---
I carried an FN FNC during my service and it weighed roughly 10lbs loaded (full magazine had 30cts 5.56 bullets), 12lbs for the scoped version (loaded). I too can't wrap my head around a 23lbs handmade (AK47). Like carrying around two fully loaded scoped FN FNCs. Fuck no.
---
They should do an RP server already, I would love roleplaying in the Fallout world.
---
I'd still smash
---
well in that case I know what I‚Äôm doing this afternoon :D
---
So double shot explosive players will grind the hell out of players making them lose all their caps. I don't know if I should like that mode or not which is all about oneshotting other players.
---
 Nope. They should just get a perm IP ban. But I‚Äôm not BGS Austin. 
---
Ok good to know 
---
If I‚Äôm the last from my group to logout, I‚Äôll add a random player to give them any workshops I‚Äôm still holding.
---
Who cares about cheaters? 
---
Moonshiner's Shack have 4 ticks. You can do it with 2 tequila with server hop if you think again. And I'm upset for I can't craft for you about different platforms.
---
Maybe if they're within a certain range of the nuke zone disabling fast travel, but it'd be a pain in the ass for anyone minding their own business on the other side of the map. 
---
Then say no? Please don‚Äôt fall for that, because then you‚Äôd look like a goober.
---
They want the golf course back from the Vault Dwellers üòÇ
---
Don't even try and speak for other people buddy. Keep that WE to an I. 
---
I‚Äôm about to try it when I get home from work. I‚Äôll post if it gets interesting 
---
Great way to potentially clear the server as everyone abandons ship to protect their camps.
---
You want the high school to yourself, don't you OP?
---
They exist. Can usually tell by the huge explosion. 
---
Herd mentality mutation. Gain extra 2 points to all your SPECIAL when on a team. 
---
Gotta let go. There‚Äôs a compromise that has to be made. 
---
really? when i go on it says ''login failed. this account lacks the required entitlements'' i googled it and it says that it means the servers are down?
---
A few stable flux, dozens of vegetables, etc. etc.
---
Vegetables are the worst one.  Have to either scrap/build one and then harvest it to repair the next one at a time.  Or go find one of each fruit/veggie to rebuild my farm.
---
That Decon Shower can be stored if I suspect greifing, but kind of sucks if I'm afraid to place it.
---
Why are we supposed to be sympathetic to a bunch of cheaters?
---
It's also pretty scary if you are not looking for pvp fight actively, and you happen to join as one of the first 3 players because everyone will know your locations. ~~I hate this mechanics since there are not even any rewards for it~~
---
You can‚Äôt switch to keyboard and mouse for 2 minutes to report them?
---
Hey! They paid good money for tee time. 
---
You know, I've seen my chameleon armor glitch so many times and make me permanently chameleon'ed that I know how to do it. I generally don't, because I don't see any use in it - chameleon doesn't seem to help all that much - but maybe it's about time I report to as a bug...
---
I think CAMPs currently aren't being used as intended. They were meant to be mobile but it appears the audience is treating them as homes. Does Beth see this?
---
Yo, that‚Äôs a dope survival cosplay.
---
What about the people that want to play during your 2-8 am?
---
Either way, somebody is losing play time.
---
It definitely stacks lol.
---
You must play PC. On Xbox and PlayStation it‚Äôs a whole another story. You see someone can ‚Äúclaim‚Äù they have a certain item you want and you join them. You tell them your location and *BAM* gets shot out of nowhere and your dead and jsut lost 200 caps.
---
I don‚Äôt have a friends list in social or in-game. Anyone else having the same problem? [PC]
---
 I want FO4 Cait's Outfit as shown in the pic for "Pump Action Shotgun Tactical skin Screenshot 1" for my female survivor.
---
No, fucking, way. Time zones? What are those? GASP.
---
It's done at 10am in New York, per Bethesda's updates. If it were overnight there, it'd be perfect where I am. 
---
i'm fine with being able to have old characters but i feel as if only being able to fast travel to stations the vault and camps will be an annoyance rather than an obstacle 
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs available in your area, but where I live Viasat Satellite internet has unlimited data. This just started like a year ago when they purchased Exede internet.
---
If it gets even 1 of the people who like to follow you around shooting you repeatedly with their OP weapons and even more OP armour then it wasnt a waste of time
---
why so you have 4 rifles/smg?
---
Aren‚Äôt the effects in those weapons the same as the now adventure mode. If so they aren‚Äôt special just slotted for pvp. Wow! 
---
The radio drama holotapes need CC as well.
---
I agree it probably deserved a nerf but when I hear someone running a meat hook or gauntlet pushing 1K dmg that‚Äôs even more lame if you ask me.  Melee weapons should never be more powerful than legendary guns.  
---
we will evolve to legendary, 1*, 2*, 3*.
---
Questions that need answered Bethesda. Exactly how long is the invulnerable period when fast traveling? No not a vague answer either. Exact seconds. What aid items are possible to drop? All aid? Only Stimpaks? What is the min and max possible? Again not a vague answer, exact. Why was damage per shot lowered? This now more than ever give players with Sentinel gear the advantage over those without. As far as why we need exact answers instead of vague ones. If we drop all of our aid in one death but the max was meant to be five, well that's a big bug. If it is meant to be a possible of all our aid then fine but say that. Being vague when adding new features is very frustrating. So please in the future, just say exactly what you mean.
---
Well said, finally good to see this written.  When I show up and my base is being demolished, I go one step further and I‚Äôll always orbital strike it myself to show them it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Funny thing is, the couple times it‚Äôs happened, the instigators end up rebuilding my stuff for me.  
---
Sounds like it. Only in Survival will you be limited to one kind of stimpack per use. So you could pop a diluted and then a regular. Not sure what the "cool down" is to use it again 
---
They have removed our atoms
---
"The golf courses are not for camping" -Assaultron
---
Don‚Äôt be fooled lmao. Just look and see if you‚Äôre in survival mode or not. Common sense. 
---
I‚Äôm kind of excited to play. I know a lot of people are mad about it. 
---
Middle of the day, when most people are at work/school. Also during normal work hours for devs. I would assume they chose the time of day with the lowest server populations.
---
"When killed during PVP combat, players can choose to spend a portion of their Caps to place a Bounty on their killer.
---
Half of the Caps spent by the slain player will appear as the Bounty reward, and the minimum cost to place a Bounty is 200 Caps."
---
Why do you make mechanics like this??
---
Someone with friends comes and kills you. You can place all the bounties you want and it gets collected by said friends, and they can come kill you again. The bounty system joke stopped being funny 3 months ago. Have you no idea how your game is being played?
---
It's not my fault that building and decorating is just so dang fun! ):
---
There already is an insane level gap.
---
The way they did it, there's also a monumental gear gap.
---
Dont forget survival for mass crafting 
---
I think its a way of getting turrets not to auto attack other players, i could be wrong but thats what it seems lime to me since you wont be "hostile" in the eyes of the turret
---
Make a new character fast for those 3 levels.
---
For the tequila it's all luck. I got a bottle of it as reward from biv but no recipe yet.
---
Because there has to be a disadvantage to everything. And its the weight for assault rifles. While other weapons have other disadvantage. Its up to you to choose whats best for you. If everything had the same damage, the same weight the same everything, whats the point of having different weapons in the first place?
---
I accidentally stole from another player last night when I picked the lock on a big incinerator looking thing, not realizing it was part of another player's CaMP, and hence became Wanted.  Short story long, I was cut down, then my killers kept trying to initiate a trade with me when I respawned, I'm assuming to give my low-level ass (I played the game a while ago on PS4, but just started it again on Xbox) some gear.  Justice and compassion are dealt in even portions in Appalachia.  
---
&gt;it'd be perfect where I am. 
---
And not so for anyone else not in your situation and where you are...  which is the point being made.
---
You could always just pretend the patch didn't come out this morning, delay your gameplay, and download it tonight when you have your "bonus GBs".  Then play tomorrow.
---
Cause no matter what time you place it, someone is going to be inconvenienced.  You just happen to be the one being inconvenienced here.
---
I used G'Kar quotes while officiating a marriage ceremony once.  People came up to me afterward saying how beautiful it all was.  And they were right.
---
My names Nog and I made my character look like a girl from anime
---
Pve armour, pvp armour. And 4 rifles all use different ammo, ammo consumption is rough with automatics. 
---
I know I don‚Äôt have to carry all rifles, but I‚Äôd like to in survival. 
---
And my sentinel ass armour is crap for pve. 
---
Just got me killed. Fucking bullshit.
---
But how would you be able to *tell?* and these are just concerns and predictions.
---
I recently moved a lot of points into strength to perk up my meelee weapons, but still use rifles most of the time. Would be nice if adding points into perception actually put my rifle damage up....  5 points in luck is a must have aswell as intelligence.

Oh yea I love me some *traps*

You can earn an unlimited number of materials and experience points

This needs to be fixed soon
---
I have reported it on a support ticket
---
&gt; I would assume they chose the time of day with the lowest server populations.
---
And the highest level of support on their own staff in house (what ever levels that may be).
---
You are on Hughes net aren't you. They are a huge scam 
---
Alright cool.
---
Agree mate it‚Äôs something I need to look into, my weapons break pretty quick being auto, maybe I could use just one level of gunsmith.
---
The 5 commons ones, yes. 
---
Atom shop items&amp; atom painted items can't be dropped. Only destroyed.

It's obviously Preston Garvey

Where is the frathouse!? Thats been driving me nuts!

I ... actually didn‚Äôt see it. I guess I‚Äôm blind today sorry about that. I need more sleep..

You cant hurt someone without them actually fighting back

No its not, it comes later.
---
Really. 
---
Is it that hard to pick the no build zone back to the perimeter wall?
---
Also new event. Golfing with friends and frag grenades. 
---
This is an amazing picture
---
I just have a 2x2 garage with all of the amenities that I plop down. Most of the workshops I claim seem to have an area where it just "fits". Then I do the resource extractors/generators (if needed). I don't bother with turrets, I just use walls for defense, if anything.
---
I am a roleplayer-build guy, I don't use my mic "in character" or anything that intense, but I like making off-meta builds and sticking to them in a big way, so I'm SUPER appreciative when I find someone doing the same.
---
and I like playing the "mysterious stranger" game, too. it's
---
 super fun.

Where is the part of patch notes where: " You‚Äôll become invulnerable for a short period of time after fast traveling, which should help prevent any nasty surprises when you load in " ? source:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)

They also break pretty quick, seeing as my perk card setup is mainly for pvp, I don‚Äôt use gunsmith.

I would really love the Prototype Medic armor from Fo3.

VATS are bad for PvP and shouldn't work for real humans.
---
What this means is that someone could shoot at you all day long, but can‚Äôt actually hurt you until you return fire and engage PvP.
---
If you are say level 200. You lose and someone gets 200 caps for killing you. If you own a workshop, players can force you into PvP without warning, no matter where you are on the map.
---
What these exploiters are doing is teaming up with 1 person waiting at the workshop and the other people finding the player on the map since you are still visible to everyone. They will hide and line up a VATS crit headshot and have the 1 person at the workshop start contesting and then insta kill you before you even know that you are in PvP.
---
Then they can continue to kill and farm you repeatedly because there is no way to drop ownership of the workshop. So you pretty much are forced to server hop and lose all your dropped loot.
---
Wow thanks for the heads up. Will be doing a new character then. Fuck that shit.
---
Juicehead milks Fallout 76 more than VNN milks Half Life 3
---
I don't think turrets should attack you on sight anyway.
---
I don't want my CAMP to be blown up by a person who might just not be interested in destroying it at first, but decided to do so just because my turrets started firing.
---
If you get killed you lose caps. Apparently it's old mechanic. Doesn't matter if you were killed through slap damage or were in mutual PvP or whatever.
---
Wait...  You're the Insult Bot?!
---
Just use the camp redeploy trick and an open space with workbenches.
---
Weapon artisan will repair weapons to 200% as max rank. And gunsmith 5 will always be  staple for guns. 
---
And luck of the draw works best when tap during as the effect it offers can apply per trigger pull. 
---
Another wish list for survival is to not reward players for killing players 20 levels below them. To encourage them to kill players their own level. Similar to how World of Warcraft wouldn't give players honor points for killing some 10 levels behind them. 
---
Same dude
---
Lol i got insta killed by so level 179 with a 2 shot explosive aa gun
---
New character = even grounds
---
Why‚Äôd you carry so much stuff with you knowing you‚Äôd lose it if you die?
---
Aside from a fancy name, all of the legendary rewards kind of suck. I would have been excited to collect everything, but after the fashnact BS, I won't be bothering with them.
---
I've been considering doing this! It's not the same as having my cute little house overlooking a waterfall, though... but recently I've been getting the itch to build without wanting to dismantle my  current camp, so I think I'll be spending a lot of time at workshops very soon.
---
I agree, as a level 3 I managed to survive long enough to 2nd spot then just got blasted from someone with a scope lmao
---
It'd be nice to see level tiers implemented in this so anyone who didn't play during dupefest 2018 actually stands a chance
---
1-20
---
20-50
---
60-100
---
100+
---
I said it earlier, Survival mode is too unrewarding. You lose quite a lot of stuff when you die to even consider it interesting.
---
On one hand I wish it would gain the popularity it deserves, but on the other I absolutely love the cozy, refreshingly non-toxic community that it has and wonder how it would change if the game grew in popularity.
---
I'm thinking if I play survival I'm going to do so with no junk and no caps. Why would I do anything else?
---
That's a big if though, since it will be a shitshow.
---
My only issue is rewarding pvp layers and not pve. It‚Äôs promoting it new version over the original.
---
Do those pulaski preservation shelters actually work for the nuke hits?
---
Yeah if you read the conversation I had with him you‚Äôd know I realized that like an hour ago
---
 Bethesda employees need to actually be at work in case it accidentally breaks everything. If it is so important, you could just wait until the "bonus time" the night of the update to download.
---
3 or 4 at the shack just below the vault. 2 guaranteed more at the shack where you start the "queen of the hunt" quest.
---
0 damage means 0 damage. How can you kill anyone freely if you do 0 damage? The person being "slapped" would have to start slapping back before either of you could do damage.   
---
killing the scorch beast queen though ..... IS??? 
---
Of course immediately when she dies..... FREE FOR ALL !!! 
---
Sorry dyslexic.  If anything people should have more options to cause it to fail. Not much crouching or hiding behind an object. 
---
I thought he was German. He's a nihilist you know...
---
Idk if they changed it since but I saw some material about the survival beta that the character limit is upped to ten acres the modes
---
Ah, that must be exhausting.
---
Bethesda is east coast so its a time frame for their office hrs.
---
Depending on what you're building, you can use the workshop's junk instead of yours.
---
If the junk is listed in green, it's the worshop's junk.  White is your junk.
---
It sounds like it is working as intended
---
Base CAMP and Diet CAMP
---
Idk why these items function the way they do however my trick for getting lots of it in a nuke zone is waiting for the initial surge of players to do their killing and then looting all the meat piles once interest wanes. I can easily farm dozens of materials in Whitespring this way.
---
Yeah, it's terrible. 
---
I Don't want battlefield 76, i wanted DayZ-76.
---
The state of survival right now is still kind of casual, with "TOP players", and not losing your armor/weapon.
---
That would make people way more careful, if it was any kind of hardcore. Death would mean death. Respawn without any item only your level.
---
I'm sorry if it is not what most people want. But imagine a world where death means death, and you actually need to protect your base or you'll lose it all.
---
And another problem is that this game is far from a fair hardcore pvp mode, i don't even know if it's feasible since there is so many RPG elements that would drift away from the pure survival aspect.
---
Anyway i'm still glad we received some kind of pvp content.
---
Cool, I wondered why my plasma Gatling wasn't shooting the green plasma bolts. I thought it was a bug for legendary plasma gatlings.
---
Because I had just logged in. And because they said you lose SOME supplies, not MOST. 
---
i've had my ticket stll waiting for an agent or over 2 and a half weeks (still waiting). their customer support is really unreliable
---
I need this game to have piano wire ASAP
---
The dude abidesüòé
---
Thank you! It's definitely the best one in my gallery
---
You look and see that you can‚Äôt see anyone on the map. That‚Äôs how you tell. Also, if everyone started at a fresh start, in a month or so everyone would be level 200 anyway and then new players would have the same issue. There‚Äôs no reason to start off everyone as a lvl 1 because in a short time it‚Äôll be back to normal. 
---
Is that a sink in your bathroom? How? Where? 
---
Well the higher level you are the more you are worth when you are killed. Once I got over level 150 I would get killed with the exploit every time I owned a workshop. Seems like more people are learning about it now and there are more high level players so the problem is getting worse.
---
That's a valid point, every update breaks something. 
---
Wait, do we even know what "Nuclear Winter Mode" is going to be?
---
Yeah I tried to run and junk everything. It gives me nightmarish flashbacks of whenever I get to sactuary in fo4. 
---
Dude I play every day and for the past few weeks I haven't even seen a 3* drop.. well that's a lie actually I killed a level 64 legendary near cranberry bog yesterday and it dropped a 3* level 10 leather chest.. better than a drill I guess.
---
I wanted decorative sausages.
---
I‚Äôm still noticing that when I leave my excavator power armor, then re-enter it, my carry weight goes down. It only reverts to the original carry weight if I quit the game and re-enter. When will this bug be fixed?
---
Jesus lol
---
They do not.
---
Yes. Kind of. But I need help deciphering them. I know that 0,0 is between White Powder and Cliff watch, but I don't know what the extents of the coordinate system are to be able to turn this into mapable data. The coordinates I've seen in the files go up over 100,000 positive and negative and I also don't know exactly what placeholders do what. For example, I can see a placeholder for an encounter at a certain set of coords but then I see a couple other things related to the same encounter name at different coords. If I can figure out the coordinate system as well as all the cell locations (because all objects and encounters are placed in cells foremost), then I can take a look at some known encounter locations to figure out what does what. For example, I know where the traveling encounter spawns in Charleston. I also know that walking across the bridge south of the station causes it to spawn. That means I can probably find the locations of both of those in the files as well as similar info for all encounters. 
---
I agree. I guess we have wait and see if we in adventure mode get a pay out next patch. And yes they wil hype up survival. It‚Äôs flavour of the month. I won‚Äôt surprised if we see more coming back to back for it. 
---
Depends on how you interpret it. They say "slap damage is removed".
---
That could either mean you deal no damage.
---
Or 
---
You can do damage and the slap mechanic has been removed.
---
You sir are a Wasteland hero. I'm level 65 and have no idea how to launch a nuke... Taking my time. Shame about the server disconnect. The timing of those seems to be horrible. I spent last night playing with lots of new mutations. Fun!
---
You would be correcto
---
What happens if you dont have any aid/caps on you when you repeatedly die?
---
It‚Äôs a few hours old Beta, it‚Äôs taken Bethesda months to get the regular game decently playable. This will be no different. 
---
Does unstable isotope proc now when someone 0 damage slaps you? 
---
You really thought you could expect more leveling new characters when pre-existing characters are allowed?
---
If you want to start that mode on lvl 1, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to. 
---
Wow, for some reason I wasn't expecting so many aid items to be dropped per death. Thought I read it was just a few.
---
I wanted that legendary grenade launcher, forget it. 
---
so if you trying to carry to be prepared for everything, of course you gonna run into weight problems 
---
I was afraid to give them a shot because I was on Exede for a bit and it was even worse than Hughes. Thanks for letting me know they're better now. 
---
Those builds that one-shotted before, they still one-shot so no real impact.
---
Listen, I can see you on the map anyway if your isolated in an area for too long I'm going to fast travel nearby and visit your camp.  I do it all the time lol.   So to assume a griefer won't do the same is crazy pants :P just accept my damn team invite so I can fast travel damn it. It's costing me like 30 caps lol
---
I assume so. ESO has great success with annual events, can't see why they wouldn't build off that model's successes.
---
This is a good idea. Beth could release some half height fences, this could be a good idea for player created planters.
---
I know, which is why the linked picture is doubly odd. 
---
No. Some YouTuber tested that theory.
---
Tschuss!
---
Yesss!
---
Whitesprings was a complete waste of time for me, when legendary farming, until patch 6 or 7. I would only get 1 star drops period. After patch 6 or 7, the place doesn't even need to be irradiated. It's been much more fruitful than west tek
---
What‚Äôs the % feel like? If you carry 100aid and some has only 20 stims there better a fair of it. 
---
I thought they did away with slap damage? 
---
They added spawn invulnerability in survival didn‚Äôt theyv
---
Your "reward" may be that players will come to you, saving you the time to look for them.  Be ready to snipe them.
---
Technically, Fast Hands works well with Pistols. The main drawback of Revolvers can be easily bypassed with this...assuming you have Luck on your side.
---
ESAD. Need a translation?
---
This is awesome! Hope there are lots of people who run around with that much stuff like you! 
---
My question is, it says that they want to try to prevent one-shots in survival and adventure. What if you hit the person you're hostile with directly in the face with a mini-nuke/mirv? Are they going to just laugh it off or be one-shot like they should be?
---
&gt;Toggle Premium
---
The what? This never existed did it? Did you mean the toggle unlearned option which appeared recently and also didn't work?
---
Nope every time I spawn I‚Äôm dead 
---
hasn't played something. 
---
Decides it's terrible.
---
Plays it for the first time. Decides he was right along.
---
Makes ANOTHER post about it.
---
Or in a nuked zone so I can share radioactive sponge,it's good thing for both of us.
---
Hey Fallout team! 
---
When do you upgrade the capacity of the C.A.M.P both budget and storage?
---
It‚Äôs annoying me that I have to throw away new Stuff I‚Äôve looted(and yes, I‚Äôve tried to optimize etc...). I thought looting everything is one of the things Fallout is about? 
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stopped playing this game last week. I‚Äôve spend more time in my camp managing the looted stuff than exploring the world. 
---
Has that been confirmed this update?  It wasn't in the patch notes, even though they said previously they were looking into it in the future.
---
37lvl killed himself with mininuke, droping like 20kinds of aid for me. Really really stupid.
---
You can I survived in fallout 76 survival on your resume. 
---
Thats why i am gonna wait trying this survival mode.. Its a beta after all
---
You seem to be balanced,  but only you can decide if its working well for you (or not) 
---
In previous fallouts, I was a gunner that enjoyed explosives.  
---
Sniper rifle, piercing exploding 45 machine gun, mines/grenades, and a missle launcher.
---
76 changed that...
---
Early on, I was building to suit the weapon I had that was working the best.  Furious fire axe, followed by a vampire machete and a hardened sniper rifle.
---
I generally play solo, so haven't done much with charisma (most are team oriented), and I selected other perks I felt were more important than most of the Luck cards.
---
 I perked accordingly.
---
and ended up as a melee/sniper combo
---
I dont remember exactly (guess I need more intelligence :) ), 
---
@L47, my spec is something like this:
---
S:15  P:13  E:9  C:4  I : 11  A:7  L:3
---
Worth mentioning mine is not legendary but I don‚Äôt see that being an issue 
---
Why can‚Äôt they just tell us exactly what was done instead of saying ‚Äúoverarching adjustments‚Äù? THAT‚ÄôS the part that pisses me off.
---
My buddy carries a BE automatic laser rifle. It 2 hits anyone in sentinel gear lol. Energy weapons are fine now. My personal IE laser sniper is amazing for clearing mobs.
---
Survival mode.
---
Lol stop being so paranoid xD
---
What? I completed this no problem on every single character. 
---
"if it's intended to be a hardmode PVE experience  (and I believe it to  be that, based on its name, description, and the precedent of Fallout  games receiving hardmodes within months of release)."
---
We know what's described as, we know what its name is, we know the precedent of hardmodes in Fallout games around this time, and we know that it's highly unlikely there would be another PVP-focussed server launched when there is Survival mode. The odds of this being anything other than a PVE hardmode are slim, but I'm open to alternate interpretations of what we know of it.
---
In the end, I'm simply asking Bethesda to consider my words in the event that it \*is\* a PVE hardmode.  I'm convinced it is, but that's not a fact and you don't need to accept it as one.
---
Seems that was core mechanic they said. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a post like this but I have seen videos on YouTube and they did not work 
---
That's what I thought, too, but me and a friend compared some weapons with 90% reduced weight handmade -vs- a fully modded gun and it still weighed about 40% of the weight of the fully modded gun. The 90% gun should weight about a pound or two,
---
So my 800 damage is gonna be higher on paper or lower? And it‚Äôs gonna be equally viable in practice?
---
Yes, and a wonderful distraction it was.
---
Toodles.
---
Do you open fire right away?
---
Why in the hell would you want to be on the leaderboard? If it puts a big bullseye on your head, and lets everyone know where you're at? 
---
Sounds like the only way they could make it worse for the people on top, is to make them a free travel spot.
---
A buddy and me spent over a day or so greeting newbies from the Vault with plans and goodies dressed in our PA‚Äôs with military emotes. We dropped in a single Enclave set, and escorted them to the OS‚Äôs camp.
---
It was a BLAST acting like a military escort lol
---
Maybe that‚Äôs because survival mode isn‚Äôt meant to be a pvp focus mode. Maybe survival is a survival mode. ü§î
---
They did for a small amount of time, however if you raise your weapon it immediately goes away.
---
Is it possible you just don't have friends?
---
"Weird name. How is that pronounced?"   
---
"It is pronounced 'tinitus'".
---
Yet some kid can survive in a fridge!
---
When will we get character skins? 
---
I want my character ti be a glowing ghoul! 
---
Take my money and make me a fucking glowing ghoul, Bethesda! 
---
I speak 12 year old I can translate!
---
&gt; I just realized that upon death you now drop some percentage of your aid items. There was another player who fired a mini-nuke at me, only to hit an electrical pole right in front of him. He was caught in the blast and died, dropping items that would typically take me at least an hour to farm on my own. This seems like too much of a risk, so I'm going to abstain from Survival Mode until they decrease the amount of aid items dropped upon death.
---
why did you log straight into pvp? go to pve, store your valuables, then go to pvp
---
LoL. Instantly accepted. You are owner of factory now.
---
"Stuff they were adding" you mean literally nothing but the pvp mode? Really dude?
---
You should be immune unless you fire right away. 
---
Just push the no build zone back to the walls. Not that hard 
---
Fast traveling may not be feasible in survival mode.
---
There's a version of it for heavy guns too, but you have to be in power armor. Stabilize perk.
---
That's actually your karma debuff, for being a douche and shooting a level 2 guy.  ;)
---
It's not a question of being able to start at level 1. It's a question of being able to transfer pre-established characters from Adventure Mode to Nuclear Winter mode, which would have serious consequences for the playerbase if it's a PVE hardmode.
---
**VETERAN STATUS: CONFIRMED**
---
**DEACTIVATING SECURITY PROTOCOLS**
---
We have sadness. So that's something.
---
Well instigating didn't do nearly as much damage as a bloodied build so I can see that.  Do you think vats crits and bloodied are reduced enough to stop one shotting too?
---
I though they removed the slap damage in pacifist mode and i would effect camps aswell. 
---
I'm asking out the new damage system. What kind of build do you have? How much damage do you do? Are you doing more or less damage than you remember? 
---
Build those concrete bunkers at the NW part if the map, furthest away from a train station and hunker down.
---
I don't think that the paper damage listed takes into account PvP. Bethesda specifically said that the alterations happen in pvp and not when attacking a mob in the game. My guess is that you do 705 against a mob but some amount less vs a player with the same damage mitigation as said mob.
---
That might be level scaling tbh.
---
I PMed you a link to the group.
---
Beauti full
---
It [sounds](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019) more like all system generated bounties are removed from Survival mode. The only bounties will be from the victim and his own cap pool. This is only inferred.
---
It's in Morgantown by Vault Tech U. North side.
---
And then OP turns around and tells specific people their base sucks.
---
Is it located at the power plant?
---
Usually because I'm trying to give away free junk, ammo, legendaries, or medical supplies.
---
He's telling the truth.  The game was bugged.  I've been killed plenty of times in less than six shot.  No workshop or event.  Pacifist mode on.  The best thing they ever could have done was create survival mode so all the tools can go PUBG on some other server than mine.  Glad they did it.
---
What's the point of a sneak build if I'm one of the top 3 alive longest? Won't players be able to zone in on me crouching in my bush?
---
Now this would be a great idea. I'd love to have a way to access more unusual items like those. Using excess ammo and pre-war money would be a great way to use those and encourage picking them up as you travel.
---
Dude... that's crossing the line.  My mom died from an infected splinter from the wooden spoon her great grandmother gave her.  At the time, she was cooking meals for homeless puppies.  :(
---
EDIT: Maybe she was cooking homeless puppies.  I can't remember.  It's not important. 
---
I got that,  but on the other side, right side of the room, looked like a broken sink on the wall.
---
Armor is a big part of the game. I chewed through people with 400 damage and max armor penetration. Instigating nets me 800. I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs still gonna be a one tap or not.
---
I'm not sure about two different weapons or for guns, but it would be cool if there were a dual wield legendary modifer for certain melee weapons. Like two-shot, but for one-handed/fist weapons. I want dual Cultist daggers or dual Death Tambos please.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what stuck out to me. Any other game I play is explaining changes like this in-depth using actual numbers. Bethesda just scrawls out a broad statement and goes ‚Äúthere - patch notes!‚Äù
---
I walked right into that one!
---
What is your non-PA armor? Do you have perks that are only active when not in PA? I ask because when you put of PA you take off your normal armor and get none of the benefits.
---
not that, but you can even see the dot on the radar. lol wtf beth. have been waiting for so long for this and then this happens. 
---
First of all, you're wrong. Secondly, you're blind. And lastly, if you're on PS4 I hope I get to kill you at least once before everyone else has had their turn trying to take you out.
---
But they've said numerous times that as soon as the PvP server was up, there would be 0 damage given through slaps. And that CAMPS can't take any damage at all. 
---
This is presuming you're in Pacifist mode, of course. If you're not, you can still take damage, I thin
---
Where is the enlistment form? 
---
Hahaha
---
What else do you do with it?  Tell your great grand kiddies I killed swagmaster for number 1 while I had Dysentery and a broken foot. 
---
Or when the company goes paint balling as a trust exercise you can be team leader and lead the whole account group to death when you get lost. 
---
And it's based on your level? I've only ever pvp'd a couple times. Maybe I just didn't notice the less than 100 caps leaving me.
---
No problem! Download speed are usually around 10 MB‚Äôs here. The data has a soft cap of 40 GBs, and after that the speed depends on usage in the area. However, I haven‚Äôt noticed any major changes in speed even when I download well over a hundred gigs in a month.
---
To me, Survival mode is a quick thing they came up to make PvP non-restrictioned, but in the end, it will be dead soon sadly. No real rewards and to unfun for most people.
---
Fucking genius lol
---
Graham is quite entertaining, and as a bonus, sold me the fusion generator plan for a very reasonable price...Had some other cool stuff, but I didnt have enough caps.
---
Havent seen him lately though...
---
How much were you carrying total?
---
I do the same if I have claimed a workshop.
---
The mode has been active for all of 15 minutes
---
Oh well then yeah. 
---
Keep them in your stash?
---
I've got to speak out about the whole leaderboards thing. Chances are say there's 10 people on a server, being on the all-famed *leaderboards* is likely and will honestly just prompt me to be like "oh fuck sake better hop servers until I'm not on them"
---
Say I climb to number one, I'm just going to *want* to get myself killed because it seriously inhibits whatever else I'm trying to do because everyone is hunting me and I can't see them coming.
---
Finally the bounty system? I could be doing really well playing all nice and smart and stealthy and some salty kid who I just killed is going to in anger just be like "yeah spend caps to make that stupid man die" and then I, with no option to prevent this am now gonna get fucked by people because they now have an unfair advantage over me.
---
I suppose it's the purpose of a beta though to iron these things out.
---
Otherwise a very disappointing patch for non-PVP players.
---
&gt; Got killed twice lost over 180 stimpacks
---
Why would you carry either important junk (black titanium, ultracite, flux, ballistic fiber) or a lot of chems in a mode where you know they can drop?
---
I have a stiff for you too.
---
I'll be over here.
---
Idk how much he had in inventory so cant tell. But he has not much. It was atleast 15different kinds of aid so i was just picking it in chaos.
---
I honestly don't understand Bethesda's intention here. Fallout was always a solo pve experience and the first game mode they add to 76 is PvP that caters to griefers. 
---
Over-saturated and over-inflated tend to be on opposite poles of the spectrum. If anything, I expect prices to rise if duping is ever really curtailed. Those goods will become less abundant and people might be forced to look at some "lesser" options. People aren't going to price mid-tier stuff super low if it starts selling. They're going to get the most the market will bear. With Whitesprings nerfed and duping stopped, it would be more. 
---
From my experience in the PC version you can't join a team in-game. Four if us playing together and we always have to quit to main menu - and sometimes quit to desktop and relaunch the game to get team invites to appear. Has been this way since we all got the game with in December/January. Haven't seen it on a bug list that I can recall.
---
Except they no longer take damage unless they engage 
---
Besides everyone knowing where you are?
---
It was roughly the same as normal workshop type pvp. My melee character eventually got killed by a TSE rifle since I was in an open area. Not the one shop type, but a pvp build. Damage seems the same. My newer rifle character is doing better. Only have rifle perks and sneak. 
---
Must just be the toilet :) 
---
Well most of it gets losts. So few take any workshops anymore.
---
I was thinking if one were to play on survival mode you'd end up having to move your caps to an alt, so you wont lose them all.
---
TBH, I've only seen those haircuts in GTA and Saints Row games.  At best you might expect a military cut that kind of resembles a fade.
---
Exactly why I'm not playing survival mode.
---
It was a pisspoor decision by the Devs to allow character transfers.  I question a lot of the decisions the higher ups are making with this game but I'm still having fun.
---
That would be extremely difficult. Any stray bullet would increase that bounty.
---
Sounds like Survival Mode is purely pvp based without many benefits for players who stay away from that. Thanks for the info.
---
Well here goes nothing. I'll try to address your points in order. 
---
Bugs: Bugs indeed became much less game-breaking over time. At launch, you would encounter at least one bug literally every minute. Some were okay and some were incredibly irritating (Not to mention all the exploits). Right now, if you are in the early to mid-game, it's unlikely that you would encounter major bugs. But in my case for example (LVL 205), there are many bugs that make the game not enjoyable. For example, a bug in the Empath mutation makes it not work properly with mutations making me receive around 15% more damage when playing alone, which seems a lot more when you get hit, especially since my friend and I run bloodied builds. So, if I don't wear PA with emergency protocols and equip lone wanderer, and if I don't play in a team, I would get one-shot by a lvl 62 ghoul. If the perks affected mutations properly, I would've need to worry about any of that. Another bug is with explosive weapons not working correctly on Scorchbeasts (or other flying enemies like cargobots for example). Shooting with explosive weapons on some enemies simply does not apply damage consistently (I tested this before the explosive weapon nerf so I don't know if it still occurs). Also, the game being an online game, it feels choppy when hitting enemies (compared to Fallout 4) and it sometimes gets worse when there are many people in the same area. These are some of the main problems that hinder my experience personally.

The game is fun yes but the locations, while they are the most aesthetically pleasing between all Fallout games, are actually very shallow and empty to the average player. In recent Fallouts, you didn't have to go out of your way to read text and listen to holotapes to get immersed in a location. The NPCs present there gave more than enough back-story to the location. If you could interact with them, they would tell you their story (giving each location a unique identity) and if they were hostile, you could at the very least infer the type of location based on enemy types. This does not happen often in 76 as many locations have randomized enemies. One of my favorite locations in 76 is the West-Tek research center as it tells a story while traversing the environment and you don't have to read anything to understand what actually happened. There are some locations like that in 76 but the rest feel very empty and even the enemies in those locations are underwhelming. Compare that to Skyrim for example where a random location would be a fort or forsworn camp filled to the brim with enemies. Also, locations in 76 don't provide compelling rewards. Very very few do. That is my opinion on locations. While they don't differ too much from those in Fallout 4, I think they are a step down compared to Fallout 3, NV, or Skyrim.
---
The quests: Let me say that Fallout 76 quests are the worst quests I have ever done in the Fallout franchise. There were some good ones sprinkled throughout. However, even compared to Fallout 4, they don't stand a chance. In Fallout 4, after taking care of Kellog, you exit the building and see a giant freaking zeppelin, leaving you in awe, or the missions where you build out liberty prime and assault the institute, or the mission when you first venture to the glowing sea... These Fallout 4 quests aren't even the best quests in the franchise (or Fallout 4) but I still remember the experiences fondly. Compared to 76, every quest I did, I wanted to be done with ASAP. Most of them were genuinely not interesting.
---
The gunplay is as average as Fallout 4. Nothing special about it except this time you add some latency to it making it slightly worse compared to Fallout 4.
---
People didn't expect the game to be perfect from day one but at the very least complete and satisfying. It was in an early-access state and the game basically didn't have and still doesn't have a compelling end-game. Add to that the MANY mistakes Beth did for the few months after release and you could see why the hate was a thing. At release, I was looking forward to how the game will develop but at this point in time, I really doubt Bethesda can make a it semi-compelling truly fun game from start to finish, at least for me.
---
I hope you read this wall of text because this took some time to write. Cheers.
---
You may be right, i don't exactly remember that part of the Notes per word
---
I think they should implement a separate camp for survival and adventure. Your adventure camp is the more permanent one. Survival just has some work benches, a cooking station, and some beds. Or go crazy and make a trap camp ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Camo deal, camo bundle, survivalist gear and a free pvp emote.
---
How many were you carrying?  The patch notes say you will lose "a random amount" aid items.  I want to know what "random" means.
---
I remember back when they said this would be in January
---
I wonder if Survival will let you fast travel to events?  To be perfectly honest, I originally didn't think I would have much interest in Survival mode.  But they've really made it tempting with Legendary challenges and so on.
---
If you are still playing 76 like an episode of wasteland hoarders then you should try switching it up. Fallout 4‚Äôs survival mode showed how much more interesting and fun the game is when you don‚Äôt brainlessly pick up everything. I am happy that 76 continues to make us consider that side of things. I would even be happier with less carry weight. 
---
I've got it haha
---
Does the other player receive the burden if all you lost? Or is this a way to delete the bulge of crap from the servers?
---
This is the place that is bugging me. I just can't find it. My personal trophy to find and build. 
---
I was able to kill a level 150 dude in full power armor with two shots from a bolt action pipe pistol lmao. Starting my new guy off with a free 300 caps and 80 stims thanks dude
---
Womp womp
---
I was the one who said i like pvp how it is. I would accept pvp servers too, but not if i lose 400caps some percentage of Every aid i have and idk what more. They did it again completly stupid way. There was like only fasnacht patch that was good for whole time fo76 is out. Yeah they fixed many things, but after every patch game is fucked up.
---
Only thing they got nerfed at WS was the exp. I did it last night chuckles and walked out with 10 1* 7 2* and at least 7-8 3*. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe duping is done. It‚Äôll be back sooner than expected. 
---
The bounty is you pay your own caps to place a bounty on them, if they cheese it with a buddy they take your caps twice. Not to mention it then accomplishes the opposite of what the system was put in place for. 
---
Ah. Doesnt surprise since they accidentally deleted the rare masks for last week. Not everything will work this week.
---
At the risk of sounding condescending, did you make sure you removed any mods on the gun when you found it?  I know I would make that mistake if I weren‚Äôt paying too much attention.  Legendaries may spawn with mods, so you have to go out your way to remove them for a comparison to be fair.
---
The other explanation is that the weight reduction perk is bigger (which is not a stretch tbf).
---
Hi! Thanks for the report. The Atomic Shop is experiencing a hiccup after today's patch release and we're actively investigating.
---
No it doesn't.  Just play Adventure.  This is getting pathetic hearing the non-stop complaints.  Sad thing is you claim to do that when you play with your friends.  Maybe that should be addressed too. Just play the damn game and if you find yourself constantly bringing up negatives and saying what should be done etc., then just quit playing and find a game that fits your needs.  
---
Some of the explosive event weapons that are coming out deal double damage or something like that if I remember if target is full health.
---
If that stacks with the perks. God dayum.
---
Double dmg Fatman + the mirv mod + perks.
---
Ooofff
---
I can make you some more Stims if you need some.
---
That‚Äôs what I have but I still get the 1 shot at times. Lvl 175 bloodied mele build 
---
Fallout *was* a hoarding game.
---
You mean that full stash?
---
The only game I've seen with good dreads is ESO.  They even had multiple styles of them.  But I'm pretty sure we'll get another four styles of mohawk and three types of balding patterns before we get even short length dreads.
---
percentage means 0%-100%. in most survival games you drop everything. 
---
after being killed players can chose to spend their caps to put a bounty on the player that killed them. 
---
fast travel mats for our camps would be appreciated too!
---
if possible, both an owner and friend/guest one too!
---
So what. They are not forcing you to play it.
---
I kinda wish I could plant on my astroturf floor pieces or have a garden foundation piece that only allows planting on top of it.
---
That‚Äôs understandable. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people  saying the entire pvp mode shouldn‚Äôt be there I‚Äôm just like... this is what you asked for 
---
I more meant the full roadmap not just stuff coming out this month 
---
What an elitist view. You must be great at fortnite
---
Seriously wtf. We need DETAILS
---
I‚Äôll give you 50 witch masks for a TSE. 
---
32 would be nice... it's 24 right now
---
I would spam daily quest/explore/kill and wait for main quest for when I'm over 45. Rewards are lvl based so the later you start them the better they are, even tho some off them will still be useless. Butbi do wish I waited I little longer to finish them
---
Yeah it hits hard for sure but my bloodied power fist was easily breaking 2k without full unyeielding gear in comparison.  Not saying it's better but I am curious if there was a hard cap on damage that would stop the bloodied build just as much as instigating.  We know there was some kind of damage need but I'm unclear what exactly lol
---
Do you have any numbers on how much damage you deal? I have calculated I can do up to 1,800 damage with my black powder pistol under ideal circumstances. Or are you on the receiving end of this? If so, tell us your damage resistances.
---
That's a good question, honestly. I'll doublecheck one of my legendaries.
---
Also me
---
most people are idiot hoarders tmwith full stashes
---
Uh, can we add some slap damage? PvP griefers sure do whine alot.
---
You‚Äôre carrying around over 20 weight in stims? Why? I started selling mine when I got to 200. And I‚Äôll be placing 95% of them in my stash before I try survival. 
---
They stopped rolling workshops over to your teammates patch before today. You can quit doing this. 
---
have an upvote!
---
you wouldn't believe how many people miss this joke :'(
---
If it didn't carry over to adventure, that would be exploited as a way to remove bounties.
---
Lol.  I love this.  Everyone knew going into this the costs of dying.  The fact that you lost 180 stimpaks in 2 deaths tells me clearly you didn't care about the costs but now that you see it, let's claim it's broken.  I wonder if you get pulled over for speeding and they give you a $500 ticket would you say the system is broken because I was only going 180mph?  
---
Boooooooom.
---
Tamed pets?
---
Survival mode is providing hilarious results as intended
---
It does not happen anymore. 
---
By PvP server do you mean survival mode!?
---
I don‚Äôt play BR of any kind. Your words fall on deaf ears. \/,
---
I only stopped because I'm covered up with ore -- it will be weeks before I manage to get all the acid required to smelt the lot of it. I still pop them occasionally to get plans, but they aren't worth defending after that. 
---
r/oopsdidntmeanto
---
Go intonthe manage game option for FO76, and clear your reserved data.
---
I mean I've put in 60 hours now so I think I'm enjoying myself 
---
Sadly this is what i believe too... I lost 400 caps and half of my food while trying to get 40 caps... There is sadly no real gain from it. I believe i will hop in once a week to get the "Special weapon" and leave the whole mode behind.
---
Don‚Äôt have one. Tried one and sold it the next day. 
---
See that might be level scaling. I don‚Äôt know how it works for 50+ characters.
---
Does bloodied effect the rad damage numbers cause I don't think they do?
---
I consider myself a PvE player in Fo76, i really looked forward for the PvP aspect in this game cause i always play PvP in MMOs, but in Fo76 pvp is broken and they didn't do anything to fix it, they just released a messy mode  that wont fix anything.
---
Why are you doing events with strangers?
---
I have an instigating lever and laser rifle. Love every moment. Still looking for a good melee one. 
---
I got my first explosive drop about five days ago as a level 180+ player. It was an AAE LMG. Never really going to try to use it for anything other than PVP because of how annoying it is to get .308 rounds in large quantities. 
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù Everything somebody doesn‚Äôt like is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù üôÑ
---
Good luck out there!
---
i think we all did this. i went to grafton vendor bot (not station) after i bought this and learned it. He almost always has the plans.
---
Bethesda fixed concrete foundation stacking already. But for those that already have one it should be interesting
---
With player vending coming up, being a bullet merchant is going to be a good business.
---
Hmmm.
---
Do you realize I got your reddit account name? Anyone you have ever emailed to, knows your email. 
---
I one out two. I mean, I've practically half hacked the entire Reddit.
---
Just were there. Pacific mode is active if you had it active on adventure. 37lvl guy killed in front of me with fatman, he droped some% of every aid he had, long list in his paper bag. Then i leaved, cause i have those 80super stimpacks and no room in stash.
---
Also atom shop don't work lol.
---
Thanks I'll roast some of that megasloth meat I got from the fasnacht parade.
---
I guess you haven't seen (the roadmap)[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019]?
---
You‚Äôll live longer by not checking in the first place. Checking changes your mindset to change the board. 
---
We should give Bethesda some time to figure stuff out. Shitting in them wont improve anything, giving good and thought out suggestions will
---
no. They have not implemented camp invulnerability yet. Hopefully when they do they also alter non-camp boundaries at whitesprings. Now you can freely destroy the camp without killing the player inside it as long as they don't shoot you in return.
---
While you were playing or when you logged 
---
It was either 2 shot or aa cant have both, man.
---
There has been a solo pve friendly mode available since launch. In fact it was the only mode available. People that wanted to pvp without a bunch of lame hoops to jump through had nothing. Theres no need to cry because the people that enjoy pvp finally got a bone thrown their way.
---
Great!
---
Just make sure you compare it with another handmade without the roll, also without any mods‚Äîotherwise you‚Äôd get a weight reduction of more than 90% provided it works correctly.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for. The numbers. What‚Äôs going on in practice, and what‚Äôs on the paper.
---
Risk/reward. 
---
Thats the point
---
Bless your heart and keep it safe from SMs and Raiders.
---
Fist i did new char and was killed by 173guy too. Life is hard. Anyway if that guy find this. I am sorry i did it for science.
---
I think there will definitely be an adjustment period. People are probably still used to assuming they will be safe at high traffic areas. 
---
&gt; turrets are pointless
---
have you not used a missile turret?  also turrets work better with a spotlight
---
Welcome to Reddit we have jackets and have a bbq on Thursdays. 
---
Survival mode is threatening for someone that doesn‚Äôt really pvp at all but I‚Äôm excited for it
---
There's no need to be restrictive to make it force fit your preconceived ideas. You're just unnecessarily limiting others and yourself.
---
"Bold" statement that some people will reflexively down-vote without thinking. Beth should just allow us to have as many homes as we want, just have them all from the same budget space. Want a home with 100% budget? Fine. Want 2 homes at 50% budget each? fine. Want 10 small camps scattered throughout the map at 10% budget each? Fine.
---
What's the difference? None. The restrictions are arbitrary. Rejecting it is just throwing a fit that it doesn't fit some arbitrary concept of we we "should" or "shouldn't" do, like those occasional clowns that get upset that others like to build full mansions, because it's called "CAMP".
---
depends on your level.  If the level of the armor was above your level, they may be loose in your apparel inventory.
---
I've seen raider parts at most of the spawn points, but IIRC, more frequently at Gorge bridge west (if you have the key)  or camden park 
---
If it helps, they go for less than 1k on the trading sub
---
My buddy had to run this quest, like, six times to finally finish it. 
---
I don't think people necessarily wanted a new mode that catered to PvP players. It was more pve players wanted to be able to play without getting griefed. The idea of a PvP server was a short sighted solution to the hardcore pvpers. 
---
A lot of people use a variation of a common username/email as their gamer tag. That‚Äôs part of the problem but really the onus is on the consumer to create unique IDs. Although, like you, I made mine a decade ago and didn‚Äôt know better. 
---
Understood, and I see your point. I think it is something they can solve over time (the concept of "seasons" has been mentioned a few times, where new characters are separate then blend into the normal character pool at the start of the next season).
---
Worth supressing them to keep armour on and not get wiped by a gamma gun
---
Yes. On top. Like in a little trailer or shack. And it's not always there if somebody grabbed it. 
---
Thanks stranger, this worked.
---
Odd chance you dropped without looking. That‚Äôs how I lost my first one. Dropped it and didn‚Äôt notice until I starting punching a super. 
---
I might have to, I dont know if I can keep playing. Super upset.
---
Have you got tuck blood tequila?
---
It's going to be hard to tell right now. The paper damage listed won't take into consideration the pvp reduction. People will have to do controlled tests somehow or data mine the actual mechanism.
---
&gt;Why have a camp in survival
---
Fast travel is limited to the vault, train stations, and your camp, so having a strategically located camp will be crucial.
---
Do you hear yourself? 
---
A sacrifice you have to make for being able to use same characters in two modes. Makes sense to me.
---
It‚Äôs soo good. Better than bloodied, two shot and explosive. 
---
I'm going on an hour. There is nobody else in my server.
---
Goes into survival mode. Cries when he gets killed. LOL.
---
I don‚Äôt know what people thought it was going to be lol...
---
I hope this isn‚Äôt a repeat of someone else‚Äôs comment, but the unfortunate flaw with being able to scrap ammo is the heavy weapon ammo (5mm and 50 cal) would be an exploit that nets you more scrap than it costs to make the ammo. Even if you only give a single piece of Lead for each 5mm you scrap, that‚Äôs a huge gain.
---
But I‚Äôm all for something to do with spare ammo. I‚Äôve never used the ammo vending machines; perhaps these machines‚Äô functionality could be expanded to buy ammo in packs of 10 units or so...
---
I don't think you understand the way the new system works and what its intended for. 
---
Not good enough.  BBQ's on Thursdays won't work for me.  It's broken.  It needs to be Friday.  
---
Yeah.
---
&gt;what the fuck am I suppose to blend in with in Appalachia. 
---
Toxic Valley is kind of desert-y?
---
&gt;5:00 pm CDT
---
Any chance you're willing to done one more?? I'll likely be on around 5:30 CST on PC
---
I made a post on this a few hours ago. I fast traveled and the same thing. Happened a few times
---
Awesome thanks! I just checked it out and found Mr. Squeeze there!
---
I sure hope so. It really irks me that people are camping stations too. I dont know. I just got really bad first impressions. 
---
Dang. Sneaky buggers. At least you got the reward for event completion
---
But nothing's changed. Only removal of bugs. Those themselves weren't enough to warrant writing off the game.
---
The design and mechanics are all the same. Perk cards are still here. Hunger/Thirst is still here. PVP is still here. No NPC's are still here. VATS is still in real time.
---
The only additions so far is one quest for 2 new crafting benches and a limited time event that's now over. Nothing's changed.
---
The majority of players who didn't quit during the dupepocalypse, perhaps. 
---
Funny how if while enduring punishment for crimes if one of those people ask about status in this small collective issue (you know, the issue that most of these comments have no feedback to give) and then it‚Äôs like you committed a new crime so some people want to put on their self awarded Rent-A-Cop caps and come billy club you a little. 
---
OP didn‚Äôt come here for sympathy or any of your opinions about perm bans, separate servers, or
---
any of your shitty remarks. 
---
OP asked one plain and simple question. More specifically, the OP asked a specific portion of the community who share this issue for feedback, and most of you salty trolls came right out of the woodwork with your delusional wishes of playing admin. 
---
In fact, it appears from several confirmed email replies BGS sent out to the suspensions that they will be reinstating most of the accounts to their owners that are under suspension, but after specific items are removed. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get my backup accounts returned to me once my punishment is finished and I‚Äôve paid for my crimes as far as BGS is concerned. &amp; When I do OP, I‚Äôll be sure to let you know. 
---
As for the pitchfork mob, I hope you all have fun pounding the sand.
---
&gt; Aha! A new CM to ~~follow~~ **summon**.
---
They are not but I wanted to play it. I love the idea of a survival experience where it's kill or be killed. The games horrendous balancing prevents that. Who the fuck wants to play in a server filled with assholes running around with there one shot builds killing indiscriminately. I've seen reports of griefers lurking around vault 76 killing newbies. If that doesn't show how fucked the system is I don't know what will
---
Thats silly. At level 130 id lose 260 caps on death. 
---
A 260 cap bounty takes alot of stray bullets. Basically ripping thru 2 entire camps...
---
Each bullet doesnt even wreck a wall. Takes a few
---
Shame. Guess we won‚Äôt see you there. 
---
It might be hard to fix a bug or bad code, and it's not prioritised over other things that add value. Or they might have chosen in principle to not focus a lot of time on refactoring and clearing technical debt. Either way it's a choice.
---
Was it legendary? If you are on PC I can make you one for free
---
Lol, for some reason i was super stoked. I knew exactly what was going to happen. I guess i just didnt want to believe it.
---
Honestly, why?  You can snipe them from far away before they can target you.  The range should be boosted before damage.
---
Always wondered the use case of a semi auto combat shotgun. Does it work for hunting or is it range only? 
---
hand holding
---
What do you mean *you people*?
---
Yea 3 star. Aa limb damage and crit. Super pissed
---
turn the fence around. it wont snap.
---
I can‚Äôt understand why so many people are going in without stashing their aid items
---
Well, you must be the only person in existence to have managed it.
---
"I have ignored the herd of elephants in the room in my response and you have become dismissive as a result, ergo I am objectively correct about this future event that has not happened"
---
+1 (one) le reddit narwhal bacon to you goon sire!
---
It is not about the bounty. If I get to waste some time and materials to fix my camp (moving camp 1" is a hit and miss), at least the "wanted" camp will spawn in a war zone for a short time.
---
To be fair, it‚Äôs common sense to look at damage first, since it‚Äôs not a new thing to get one shorted in pvp. Should have already had a damage modifier for this mode. It seems rushed
---
I understand exactly how it works.  All your junk lost and random amounts of items in your aid.  Nowhere did they say how much.  If I have 300 items of in my aid section then random means anything from 1-300.  I'm not sure you understand it. 
---
Yes!
---
I want an in-game Bender Fastnacht mask
---
There is no Disguises in vats. 
---
yes please
---
Legitimately? Lol Foreal? Is it that serious to need to get one illegitimately? How would you even get it otherwise? People take this game way to seriously. I play way more than my boyfriend I still haven‚Äôt gotten that mask. He decided to get on and play the event once with me and he got it. I didn‚Äôt even know that was considered ‚Äúrare‚Äù cause I seen a good amount of people with that mask. 
---
I am guessing that this is a lag issue and ping issue. On the screen for them you are there and have been through the immunity period. On your screen you are still loading.
---
It's a great pairing with a .50 cal, one heck of a good "sidearm"
---
Ty :)
---
But if you used berry mentats it would counter his whole build correct?
---
It doesnt have to be a pvp mode, but the main difference between adventure and survival is pvp. thats why the leaderboards should help people who want to pvp find others to challenge, rather than forcing those who might not want to pvp to be challenged.
---
It's not even hard, just go to the hand scanner cabins, they always spawn there for me. 
---
Damn, you lost your opossum bacon? 
---
Add me psn realsouthdanks 
---
Alright I‚Äôll give that a go first, thanks! I just figured with the update worse case scenario.
---
Thanks for the Info, now iam hyped 
---
Yes. It works for me in toxic valley. Especially since it‚Äôs wide open.
---
You can still one shot players lol.
---
Which is why it would remain for the next time the player joins survival mode, in this scenario. Regardless of how long it‚Äôs been, the player would have the bounty appear the moment they reconnect to survival. 
---
It‚Äôll probably just persist through to adventure but we‚Äôll see!
---
i suppose turning predator level invisible isnt enough?
---
S.H.O.O.T. System
---
Simple Home Optimized Offensive Turrets system
---
lol.  at the bbq or survival?  I'm not the one crying about the system being broken. 
---
Yeah its good to know i only lost 360 Caps doing the event. Even If i saw hin beforehand, i couldn't have killed him because the was doing the same event as me. That sucked...
---
Uhhh I knew u lost supplies just not 90 stuns per death don‚Äôt think it says that anywhere??
---
I hope it comes before the player vending.
---
Nothing about PA AFAIK..
---
Sort this Subreddit by New or Rising.  You'll see a lot of posts about this already.  Bethesda has replied.
---
Your missing my point entirely. People have every right to enjoy PvP, I enjoy it myself to when it's not against one shot builds that will combat log rather than die. The balancing of PvP is ridiculous and anyone that tries to defend it is delusional. 76 is suppose to be a casual experience. You shouldn't have to spend hundreds of hours either farming for the right gear or caps to buy said gear. Should be able to just log on and have fun. 
---
Sounds like a good idea. If you wanna die!!! There's just too much mistrust in the anonymity of the internet for random unaligned people to see a responder and assume safety.
---
Best of luck. I recommend trying [Guilded](https://www.guilded.gg/Fallout76/lfg) out.
---
I happen to have an Assassins Explosive Lmg and a Bloodied explosive version of the LMG and perked out it hits [without psychobuff] around 200 per shot with the bloodied variant. From my early field testing pvp the stagger mechanic with this weapon coupled with its high rof makes it  a fantastic counter to meele and stationary snipers.  I'm very excited to test the gun out in survival mode tonight. 
---
Porta-camp
---
That is me, a lot of the time. A quick single-foundation blueprint with stations, stash, and walls to protect you while you work. Ignore the rocket turrets on the wall, they are turned off. Turn them on with that switch if you like.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug you‚Äôre just too low to do damage. Maybe stay away from that mode at a low level
---
nope, bloodied doesn't affect the rads
---
Yes please are u on xbox that would be so great 
---
And yet. They won‚Äôt ever answer our questions and concerns with porting existing characters over to Survival. STOP IGNORING US. 
---
I had just picked up 15 pipe weapons and scrapped them
---
This deserves many more upvotes.  Seeing the way people dress in the game was a lot of fun.  Plenty of predictable outfits but many more unexpected combinations.  That yellow beret works well with a lot of outfits, and full marine armor looks total badass.
---
May I suggest a pacifist mode with slap damage?
---
Look on the bright side, at least you don't have to prey on workshop owners. 
---
OMG that‚Äôs 80% of your stims and 90% of your dog food roughly or thereabouts..... OUCH!
---
I had a camp going up the cliff next to the charleston landfill for east access to get up and down the cliff. Graham used to always use my camp to get down the cliff 
---
Then try a bloodied, sneak melee build. Include Nerd rage and adrenaline and one shot anything but scorchbeasts. Maybe those too, but they'd have to land first lol)
---
Hunting groups of friends can pump it to 30?
---
I know 
---
lederhosen on a duck!?!?!?
---
You are the first person on any forum or any presence that talks about fallout 76 who has actually been nice and not just tell me "go to hell cheater, we are better off without you!" I love this game and just miss playing. I preordered the game full price and have spent money on atoms. All I want is open communication with Bethesda. Even if they told me it was going to be another month (which i hope it doesn't take that long), at least I'd know and not be reduced to trying to login every day. Thank you for your kindness and hopefully you'll be unsuspended soon too.
---
I don't have the handmade at the moment, but I have a legendary two shot double-barrel shotgun with 90% weight reduction.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/FCwhGgX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FCwhGgX.jpg)
---
**Fully modded, 90% reduction weight:** 8.4 lbs
---
**Stock, newly crafted:** 8.4 lbs
---
**Stock, 90% reduction weight:** 3 lbs
---
I removed all mods and put the standard attachments that the newly crafted one has. At stock, the gun is 3lbs, about 65% of the weight of a 8.4lbs stock, so it's definitely not 90%. That puts it about the 40% as the handmade my friend had.
---
So... that means 90% weight reduction is incredibly misleading. Not broken, just misleading. The only way 90% makes sense is if the gun didn't come with *any* basic mods. The gun itself has a base weight, but that doesn't include the standard barrel,  stock, etc. But nobody has a gun *without* a barrel. This means it's impossible to ever actually have a 90% weight reduction because the guns are going to come with standard attachments (barrels, magazines, etc).
---
Thank you, that  makes sense. 
---
There is always the build-inside-something option.  
---
Indestructible shell is good, being invisible unless they know to look is even better.  
---
Example: railcars turned on their side. Build a full home inside, invisible to anyone walking by. Just don't use the loud generators and such.  
---
There are plenty of other places. I have explored a lot of locations with this in mind and found tons of options. Some obvious, some really subtle.
---
&gt;you gonna go buy some games with my reddit account tho? 
---
I got a TS drop a while back and it wasn‚Äôt really useful so stored it.  When I pulled it out after the patch it was a whole lot of fun burning through the thousand or so .308s I had saved up.  
---
You can't lose things from your Stash lul.  
---
That‚Äôs a solid argument, but having to deal with the cost/red-tape of adding in something that might necessitate a re-rate is not what the above commenter suggested was what is stopping them from being added. 
---
ok call thank you.
---
Upvoting because I‚Äôve seen folks run their mouths about stupid stuff that they don‚Äôt know about.
---
Just don‚Äôt understand their continued hate, when they‚Äôre publicly called out.
---
Excuse me?
---
I thought about this, but then realized that if everyone is customizing the names of their guns and armor then it will probably slow down the game. Pretty much same reason they slowly increased the stash size.
---
It's also something that will be difficult to test because the alteration happens in both modes and doesn't effect mobs. So is the difference between mobs and pvp players the damage adjustments or is it just the differences in normal DR.
---
Yes, you have to make it yourself 
---
I see a lot of people that have a very poor grasp of what "rare" means.
---
What are the rewards for being in the top 3 besides badges?
---
I had initially stashed some aids for fear of this. As for caps, I just went and spent them all on some plans. Now I got nothing to lose!
---
Yeah they way the patch notes made it sound I thought it would be a small randomized amount of aid
---
Ok so im going out with 10 stims and 2 stealthboys
---
And a bunch of aid i never use like buffouts, calmex and boiled water. 
---
Gotta think ahead!
---
And they have NEVER responded to ALL the inquiries about it. It‚Äôs so damn frustrating. At least give us a BS answer. 
---
Sounds like excavator armor in adventure mode is the way to go!
---
Before joining survival, create new character in adventure, level up to 50 and re-buy all of the legendaries.
---
Well for one, they told every suspended account that it was temporary. Second, I never cheated and I know there are a lot of people who also didn't cheat that equally want to play again.
---
ppl have reported losing up to 90% of each of their aid items right now
---
no where near as many bugs than even as close as Christmas and new dlcs being added
---
Sort by New or Rising.
---
Read the 500 posts asking the **exact** same thing?
---
As expected when no one is looking into the one shot problem/weapons
---
No character lock! üîê NO! üëé
---
2 mines.  That‚Äôs an important number because if you drop 3 they fuckin explode.
---
oh im sorry i thought we were making up silly sentences
---
That is different than the bounty system. Here is how the new system works. If a player kills you you can chose to place a bounty on them, you use your own caps to do so then whoever kills that player gets the caps you put up.  
---
Yeah first time at whitesprings I bought an 1 star instigating sledgehammer that another player had sold to a vendor.
---
100 levels later it's still my best weapon for farming the ghouls. 
---
But they said it was temporary, that's why i want them to stay true to their word.
---
Oh man. You are missing out. They had a flash sale for like 30 minutes on some AMAZING one of a kind items. 
---
All of it practically free!
---
What‚Äôs adventure mode? 
---
One shot fest, who would have thought uh ?
---
So wanting a system to serve it's intended function is bad? 
---
"I just lost 180 stimpaks! This game sucks!" (Conveniently pretending to not mention why he needs to carry 1,000 stimpaks to begin with)
---
I looked in new and couldn't find anything about this particular problem.
---
I did see one where nothing was showing, not even bought items
---
No you‚Äôll just be useless and have your experience ruined. 
---
I use the AstroTurf foundations for my Brahmin pen. Looks pretty good and you can snap the fences on.
---
What do people expect??? Lol. 
---
True. You would have to be dumb enough to notice the settings of the map.
---
I had an SMG bug out a while back. For some reason it would never lose condition no matter how much I used it. I wasn‚Äôt really specced to use it, but having an unbreakable sidearm was really cool. I eventually modded it with a new receiver and that apparently fixed it, but it was a good few weeks while it lasted 
---
but my point is in adventure mode on leveling up to lvl 5 you get a splash s reen saying welcome to PvP.
---
in survival mode you also get the pop up even though I had already died
---
If you claim a workshop and start building, doesn't it move your camp?
---
Turn of pacifist mode !!!!
---
Right? Who tf
---
I just tried a minute ago, no it has not been fixed.
---
I think it‚Äôs fallout 4 they are talking about - there‚Äôs a random encounter in the south west where there‚Äôs a ghoul kid stuck inside a fridge. 
---
Nope! My game is 100% Clean. Only file touching I've done was just to get the photomode images and that's about it.
---
i was thinking more inside a safe room, so, say if you are sleeping, and someone decides to raid your base, they will have a face full or turrets inbetween them and you
---
Slap damage is zero in Adventure now. 
---
I'm loving the full NCR Ranger gear I got for 50 atoms.
---
Damage has not changed. Before you were skipping the down but revivable state. Now you get one shotted but go in the down but revivable state
---
I dont think ill bother with big base in survival. As basic as possible and as hodden as possible.
---
Still the 8 4 2000
---
When does the next fallout game come out?
---
I think its odd that people don't understand the system I'm talking about but just attack me for no apparent reason.  I used the word griefer, perhaps exploiter would have been better. 
---
It's absolutely insane, the amount of detail!
---
Honestly, on the detailed world alone this game deserves a spot in history.
---
Go look up The Greenbrier in White Sulfur Springs if you haven't already! 
---
From what I understand you lose more than just junk when you die, i think it was junk, aid, caps .
---
Hell yeah! They come like a swarm or what?
---
I was killed after fast travelling (did not attack), by an explosive weapon user. This somehow bypassed the 'invincibility' frames.
---
I just really don‚Äôt understand why transfer of characters is allowed in SURVIVAL. Is it too hard to lock the mode exclusively to new characters? What in the fuck.
---
the FO3 one is a reference to indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull.
---
a nuke is about to go off on a testing site where our main character is and he jumps into a fridge (picture like... nuke town esque place, might be a reference too Indiana jones too) and somehow magicaly survives a nuke in it.
---
Yet my point proven further. Lol
---
Oh ok, i remember something like that in fallout 3 for some reason.
---
Yeah, I figured that out in short order after sneaking through countless ghouls, super mutants and other fun things the long way the first time. 
---
INCISOR IS THE BEST MELEE PERK
---
Hmm?  Good day. 
---
I didn't miss anything because literally none of what you said was mentioned in your first post. If you want a casual experience where you can just long in and have fun with no worry, then play Adventure mode. Its still there. Stop complaining because a mode for more hardcore players exists. This game isn't designed solely for you.
---
Very much worth it
---
...or, y'know, you could just buy the gun if any vendor has it instead
---
So, what are you using? I'm predicting Assassin/Sent and an explosive shotgun or handmade...
---
Where has it been stated it was DC only? It appeared in the Anchorage campaign too.
---
In reality the National Guard would only get army issued gear, usually hand-me-downs. They don't get exclusive picks on gear. I understand Fallout might be different, but it's not likely.
---
No, workshops are like a new camp that you get while the old camp is still existant
---
I want to make a second account just to upvote this a second time 
---
Probably not during the beta. But I'd wager Bethesda is watching to see how playstyles roll out in survival. I'm sure at first, it will be a bit of the PvPocalypse that some people think it will be. But I think after a while, it will calm down, and will just become a more high stakes game. If it does, Bethesda will probably start implementing things like that. If it just stays a PvP arena...why do things to encourage team play if everyone just kills each other.
---
Wanna provide me with some links mr snarky pants?
---
I have a character at 42 and I haven't hit the Morgan town airport yet. At 50, I'll get the Somerset special. Then I'll go for the perfect storm. Then a level 50 black diamond. Then I'll continue all of the main and side quests. Will be awhile before I am bored.
---
you're right, my error. forgot to include that
---
Agreed üëçüèª
---
Even with the hard bargain perk card maxed out?
---
I got even magazine from guy, haha. Poor him.
---
Death is a viable alternative to communism
---
Probably carrying 100 stealth boys too. 
---
Bloodbath after events lol
---
As expected when so little thought went into it. Like the damage from AAE, BE and BAA....right now people are just camping train stations and one shotting everybody
---
Welcome home.  If your on PC my camp is always open to friendly visitors.
---
ITS A PVP MODE THE POINT IS WE CAN ATTACK YOU FOR NO REASON
---
WE DONT NEED ONE
---
GO BACK TO ADVENTURE
---
Not really. Too heavy ammo, have to farm it 24/7 and PA is necessary for decent dmg.
---
You can 1 shot people still.
---
Haven‚Äôt they been broken since release?
---
I got no rewards other than the sweet sound of explosions killing me as i spawned. 
---
I lost 500 caps, about 20 diluted radaways, some junk, and my will to play anything in survival. 
---
 I dont understand what makes instakilling players so fun?
---
I heard a couple things but take it with a huge pile of salt. RNG is decided upon when you create your character, and possibly the server you are on. There is no way to determine if a character or server has good RNG, but you can tell if it's bad based on many drops. If this stuff is true, your character may have bad RNG.
---
Oh, someone can buy games with your account name on console?
---
What system are you on? If you throw me some spare materials I can mod your stuff for you 
---
That would be a dream come true for sure
---
That one's not a secret to me. On my 161 character I use that for my melee. It's the one that ignores armor something like that right?
---
If consoles ever get text chat (even proximity based) I'll come back too. I just want to effectively  get organized into larger groups to run late game content, something Ive found impossible to accomplish  in game.
---
I have like 70 hours in and haven't launched a nuke because I can't solo, and nobody responds to random invites on xbox.
---
Not to compare the two, but Destiny had this EXACT problem. The best content being locked behind signing up for forum boards and scheduling 12 man's a week in advance when everyone's schedule lines up.
---
With a corresponding "I'm an alt, I really don't need your stuff and would prefer you give it to a real newbie".
---
/u Valseek ?
---
/u Ladydevann ?
---
It was already reported is it a permanent change??
---
How about if they throw in a toothless man mask? Will that ease the butthurt
---
A damage buff? When people are saying they‚Äôve killed people in power armor with a bolt action pipe pistol? Come on. 
---
What system
---
Yes.
---
Dont use dodgy! Its a trap!
---
Quite, i wish they made it so you lost nothing in the beta. So that way they can tweak it before players get insta killed by all the tse guns
---
I just logged in, and the left top side of the screen frequently shows that people are getting killed. It‚Äôs often the same people, and the one wanted person I see is at Whitespring, so I bet most people killing and dying are there too. 
---
So I think the lesson is to stay away from high traffic areas. Use uncommon paths to the more uncommon stations. Because right now we have a raider movement across the wasteland and people are just enjoying killing for the heck of it. 
---
&gt;But, with train stations being on the list of possible spawn points, I don't see why you would need to do that.
---
The closest train station to the mire is Whitesprings, which is still a heck of a hike if you need to get someplace like Abbie's Bunker. Hell, even Harper's Ferry is a solid 5 minute walk from there.
---
This is all I want tbqh
---
This has been happening since the beginning. I lost my primary gun at random once a few months ago and i just lost a sweet bloodied, swing speed, + agility boxing glove. I literally took the boxing gloves out of my stash and fast traveled to a friend's camp and like that, the glove was gone.
---
Fortunately I wasn't using it as I'm  not a melee guy, but that was the first legit drop I've gotten in months.
---
Still pretty pissed about it.
---
Ironic coming from a raider faction lol
---
People don't farm the perfect weapon, they sell all the imperfect weapons and buy the perfect weapon from someone else.
---
Hmm.  The 3 times I have found him all were in that area - once across from the Mysteries manor, once on the bridge, and once in front of Posiedon.
---
Stoked about the XP bonus. I did the Wes Tek run and cranked out almost 8000 xp.  Didn‚Äôt have problems with any other player cause I avoided the gathering locations, 
---
It sounds like to me that Survival Mode would actually be fun if there were no legendary effects. The legendary effects are what seem to be making pvp very one sided. You either instantly kill someone or get killed yourself. I‚Äôd like to see pvp actually being pvp with healing and actually doing gradual damage instead of just whoever shoots first kills the other player.
---
This is incredibly infuriating. So disheartening that it pushes my hand to really rethink spending money on Bethesda games. 
---
People get upset when their expectations aren‚Äôt met. Doesn‚Äôt have to be bad (it can even be good) but it it‚Äôs not what they wanted, people feel disappointed. 
---
Good for you for letting yourself enjoy a good game, when so many others ran away from it. 
---
It does double damage if target has full health üëç
---
Mythbusters once tried this out
---
You would either get cooked alive or the shrapnel from *inside* the fridge would kill you
---
Tell that to my lvl 100 alt with gear just as good as my 260. From lvl 60-100 he‚Äôs been wrecking people lvl 200+, probably farmed at least 25-30k caps off high level ppl. Still doesn‚Äôt make it fair that they lose more when they die.
---
Plays a PVP mode with an unkitted low level character.
---
Gets one shot.
---
Sounds about right.
---
How about no stash space + traveling pharmacy?  Those type of players shouldn't be punished if they don't have gear comparable to the tons of extremely rare duped gear that currently infests the game.  But I guess this mode isn't for the average player.  Yet another aspect of this game that is essentially locked for a large group of players.  
---
The foundation glitch was patched so an impermeable bunker is now impossible .
---
Even if they had one - you need an entrance, you still need a way in, and that way in can be attacked.  
---
Also Bunker bases arent immune to scorbeast acid attacks... just lure one over   (personal experience by trying a bunker base near a fissure) 
---
&gt;If it just stays a PvP arena...why do things to encourage team play if everyone just kills each other.
---
One of the community managers mentioned in the patch note thread that PvP is disabled during group events, so you could still go kill the SBQ and not worry about getting ganked until after the event.
---
So I‚Äôm adventure pvp is disabled until you enable it or? Because if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll probably come back to 76 and play 
---
i was wondering if when a player is created there is some hidden mechanic for RNG that randomly gets attributed t your character
---
It was a fun event. Only disappointment I had was never getting the recipes for the donuts. Glad I found two of those ever lasting donuts Sunday. They will now sit in my stash until next year when we hopefully get this event again.
---
I always keep hold of all ammo I find. People said I was crazy. But who's laughing now!?
---
Lol yeah right ! Where did I put my tinfoil hat , it can‚Äôt be true at all. Why would the developers do that ? Huge grain of salt indeed 
---
Every detail in this is great, it looks like it could be used as promotional material, especially the way that the guy on the left tilts his head.
---
Adrenal reaction, marsupial, birdbones, speed demon are good mutations. You will want class freak and Nerd Rage, possibly bloody mess. Bloodied Mr handy is doing 250 damage, and bloodied Dragon is doing 1300. Bloodied grognaks is 1100. Only 1 melee card level 1 used. Good luck on your journey! If you need more help I'll tell you more of my set up.
---
I have a camp just outside of Watoga Station with easy access to my crafting, farm, and water purifier, and a sign saying to take what they need. It‚Äôs not uncommon for strangers finishing up with SBQ to stop by for a bit to work on stuff, and leave behind spare plans or flux as a parting gift.
---
Never said I run around with no caps, just offering a solution.
---
Also, crits never miss for me or leave them alive in my case, so I just might be that lucky.
---
OMG. I feel so much stupider than normal.
---
Yes. The foundations with the green top.
---
Didn't think so thabks buddy. We s ti ll gotta meet up so u can mod my radium rifle sometime 8)
---
He really gets around. Does he actually walk or teleport? Cause I transverse by walking everywhere and i dont see him as often as I should
---
PS4
---
The quest is to register one for mass production. Technically, you don‚Äôt even have to register the first one.
---
Being able to switch back and forth between modes finally killed this game for me
---
This is the funniest thing I've seen all day. 
---
Basically,  yea. 
---
There's no slap damage.  Only way to do damage is to engage with the other person in adventure mode
---
If I'm in the top 3 and in sneek, will I be visible on the map?
---
Using mods?
---
I'll take the santa beard with color options. Thanks. 
---
So, does this guy get credit for honarary QA? These lists are.. extensive! ü§Ø
---
Having a server for only new characters would solve the problem for about a week. There are people with nearly unlimited amounts of time to spend on this game, apparently, and they'll outpace more casual players in a finite amount of time.
---
But having servers that are divided up by level range is an idea that will solve the problem forever. Ranges can be overlapping, so that your level 17 player has a choice of joining the 10-25 or 15-30 server, but can't go rampaging through the 1-10 zone.
---
Idk, but please don‚Äôt be the type of guy to go sneak sniper build.
---
My friend is having the same issue. I figure it won't stay a glitch for long, as you can't spend your atoms and Bethesda want your atoms!
---
I usually switch out between a one handed with a shotgun and a 2 handed with a non automatic rifle 
---
Honestly at this point Im running around spec'ed into Melee because I'm out of ammo from trying to do runs looking for legendarys since they decreased the drop rate. 
---
To give you an idea my special is 11,11,6,5,11,5,7
---
Simple. Save caps, troll Reddit, find weapon/armor you want and trade. That‚Äôs what I did. 
---
Not all heroes wear capes 
---
3 possible reasons. Free fast travel, to give you stuff or if none of my team mates are playing and you are solo in a nuke done to share rad sponge and get free rad healing
---
I might be able to help later tonight. About 6 hours. I believe i had the plans and can do it I just wanna double check
---
This is a nice little hissy
---
You absolutely did not 
---
They didn't do it, it's just something people say. If it was the case the dataminers would have found it by now.
---
A keyring and a card holder. FO3 had a keyring. It was great.
---
Welp 76 is gonna get downloaded again now
---
No it's not bad.  If you have a bounty on your head that someone paid for and a friend kills you to remove the bounty, the system worked as intended.  A bounty was paid and placed on you.  Bounty is removed upon death and awarded to whoever kills you.  No fault in the system.  
---
Considering illegitimately is the only way anyone has ever gotten one, yes. Yes it matters.  
---
On PC mine are showing correctly.
---
then you need to defend it 24/7....  
---
otherwise someone will swim, then destroy the inside and pop away...   all while you are gone... 
---
Does it change anything about the PA? like when you mine ore for example? In the terminal it says proprietary software for mining and must be registered so I was wondering if you get more if it is. 
---
Yes it is I believe 40% 
---
It is true. I would also suggest priming it, as you can then make 4x ammo with fluorescent (aka the cheapest) flux.
---
Well, it makes workshops even more useless. That's a thing, right?
---
I might be able to help you out, would you be willing to do 500 caps?
---
what he said
---
Honestly 
---
I thought so too. A mix of unyielding and bolstering and the low HP perks are more stable than expected.
---
May be less than that but it will still probably cost more that 1k caps. Max hard bargain adds a subjective +9 to your charisma score which will reduce the cost but it won't be a 50% reduction in cost.
---
Ah jeez, sorry man, I'm on pc
---
My favorite, I think, is the scorch beast raider power armor helmet. 
---
I think Bethesda is partially out of touch with all this branded in-game stuff, especially on weapon and armor skins.  There are so many other things you can decorate weapons and armor with, but why just plaster Vault-tec livery all over it instead? At least those knife skins look different, but everything else needs a lot of work.  
---
Gaus Rifle best DPS Rifle 
---
Dragon Rifle Best single shoot damage
---
What do you mean? 
---
An anti armor explosive pipe bolt action rifle ? 
---
It benefits from gun perks /rifle perks / explosive perks so I guess that one would be ‚Äúbest‚Äù slow as hell weapon though 
---
Mules are cheating. You won't convince me otherwise, but you're welcome to try.
---
okay if no one else comes through ill add you thanks. how many caps for you to buildit
---
The effect is on the arms once you make it I believe, so you shouldn‚Äôt have to.
---
I don't really get it
---
Thanks a lot. I actually have a bloodied mr. Handy that just sits on one of my mules because I'm not bloody currently. So I guess that'll be an interesting Little Weapon. Thanks a lot man
---
Probably a fat man but I dont know.
---
Thank you! appreciate it!
---
When you register the first excavator armor. You get the plans for the power armor station. 
---
What platform
---
Sure, if you have a card linked to the account. Helluva way to grief somebody: charge a few thousand in shit games to their account. 'Course, getting caught means PMITA prison time, but who doesn't use seven proxies these days? 
---
Full Unyielding armor for the damage boost from strength and the AP from agility, preferably with either Sentinel's (take 15% less damage while standing still) or Cavalier's (take 15% less damage while sprinting), but pieces with both are super rare and very expensive.
---
Nerd Rage, Dodgy, Serendipity, Evasive and Barbarian for defensive perks, maybe Ironclad as well if you can fit it in.
---
Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, Tenderizer and damage perks relevant to your weapon class (preferrably melee) for raw damage,  Incisor and Martial Artist to boost dps as well.
---
Your bloodied melee weapon of choice (I prefer fist weapons, I got a Bloodied/Swing Speed/+1 Strength powerfist and it's insane).
---
Understood, thanks for the response. 
---
I got them all once. Charter hadn‚Äôt been behaving well that week and so my connection was absolute booty, but it was just barely enough to connect to Xbox live. I guess when I joined in they realized I should still be allowed to play but didn‚Äôt want me messing up other people‚Äôs experience, so I was in a server alone for like eight hours. 
---
Man I whish, I'm currently using my raider cosplay. I have 3 raider pieces with  assassin legendary effect, the chest with dense mod to avoid dying to ballistic explosive grenades, and a chameleon combat armor leg and an auto stim metal leg. Also I'm using an automatics rifles build, currently rocking a anti armor rad rifle.
---
New Vegas*
---
It's been confirmed since the roadmap release and that's been the splash screen since Biv rolled out.
---
I think I got like 20, but they killed me. Still I managed to get the stimpaks in the stash!!!!
---
If they wanted to beta test it properly they should have prevented player transfer. As it stands its going to be very hard to see anything else aside from the out cry of players getting wrecked by god builds. Hopefully Bethesda's sees this and makes changes accordingly
---
"Vaults" sounds very intriguing. The other content you mentioned lines up with what we have personally observed in our travels vis a vis higher level people. 
---
Seems ironic that such a team-oriented game has practically no incentive structure or difficulty curve implemented to actually draw people together into teams to overcome content. 
---
Everything seems geared towards solo or co op, and while I know this might ruffle some feathers, I can personally say that with my wife having to wait 5 minutes while I read a terminal to get up to speed with a quest; that system seems broken for randoms working together. I doubt any random would wait for me to do stuff like that. 
---
I doubt any modern online game is ever truly ‚Äúout‚Äù of Beta 
---
Is there a limit to the number of mines you can place?
---
Relax. It‚Äôs going to be fine.
---
For quality of life change the blueprint budget to be the same as the build budget. As it is now blueprints are 90√∑ useless. 
---
There's no reason for a confession.  The game, and bethesda, had ALOT of issues at launch.  The team working on FO76 is doing alot of good work and made significant improvements with more to come,  but that doesn't mean the game that was released was hot garbage.
---
So I was mostly right. Well, at least this will quickly educate all the noobs. Better enjoy the feast of idiots while it lasts. They will get frustrated and give up in a few days and then all that will be left is other hardasses.
---
AP = LIFE with cavaliers or crit builds
---
That means that YOU have shit luck. 
---
I'll still be online then.  Even if I run out of donut recipes, there seems to be enough interest in the [Fasnacht After Party](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b5q1c9/pc_h_surplus_fasnacht_masks_plans_recipes_w_karma/) that someone else is sure to have one.
---
So you‚Äôre tell me that if I put a bounty on someone, essentially paying caps for their death, and someone else does the killing part. I actually have to hold up my end of the bargain? 
---
Literally unplayable 
---
Bis spater 
---
Just the right amount of rads coming through
---
I swear to god gamers are the whyniest, most entitled group of consumers in the entire planet. 
---
why not? What is the point of the game without a character lock? Its not a pvp arena, its a sandbox, but why let people in and out of the sandbox whenever they want? that has nothing to do with survival. 
---
pretty sure they mentioned it in the patch notes that theres a max damage per hit.
---
.... better than losing 600 caps?
---
Full Unyielding is unnecessary!!
---
That's cool.
---
It's interesting watching people try to remain excited about this game.
---
I however, do not retain the interest.
---
This game has been and will remain to me as an absolute trash fire of a video game, and the pinnacle example of what a video game post 2006 should NOT be on launch.
---
Personally, after about 4 weeks, reaching lvl 113 and having nothing but problems along the way, that's where it ended for me.
---
I sold my copy of the game for $8 after 4 weeks. It has permanently marred my perception of future Bethesda titles and I will likely never touch another product with bethesda's name attached to it, going forward.
---
In contrast, Division 2 has been the polar opposite in terms of quality on launch, and Bethesda should be fucking ashamed of themselves that this game ever saw the light of day in its current condition. It still runs like absolute shit to this day on my brand new PS4 pro, and that's unacceptable for a game that runs on an engine over a decade old.
---
Bring on the downvotes for my honesty.
---
Be careful if you do this, there are reports saying high level played stalk the vault for easy kills. 
---
damn no need to be offended.
---
It‚Äôs I believe ima loading screen in Fo3 and in game somewhere. 
---
The M Series/platform of weapons are sent over to the west coast for storage and for police use. And the current combat rifle and assault rifle are starting to be standard issue for main army, marine, and Air Force. 
---
Also don‚Äôt forget what we see as confusing makes more sense to the fallout  world. I makes odd sense but yeah. 
---
R-91 and N-99 10mm are the more known weapons. But he AER-9 laser rifle is also being added to the standard issue. 
---
What better to protect the nations capital than the reliable R-91?  AMERICA!
---
As to why is appears in the battle of anchorage is probably pre DC NG use. 
---
Ah yes, one quest, fixes of issues and 2 locations that should've been finished to begin with. Much wow.
---
A year wasted on finishing the base version of the game with no changest to the pointless pve endgame whatsoever. Astonishing indeed.
---
Incorrect, it still works, did it a couple times in the last couple days.
---
I play heavy guns and am super excited for action hero
---
In that case....
---
Stop HITTING yourself! *bam one shot.
---
You laugh, but I once had a customer whose last name was Shithead. 
---
Protip: that's pronounced "shee - THEED." She was unimpressed with my... er... alternate version. 
---
That's the etc. Lol I run west tech too. Just no good drops from there either. 
---
I was using the pipe weapon glitch for extra damage until they fixed it in the patch this morning... :( Back to melee
---
Thats very nice of you.
---
Survival mode was a great idea with a crap execution. They needed to make it restricted the first month to only new characters before allowing the flood of level 300 that have no-life'd the game. With their 3 star everything that 4 shot anyone they fight with their explosive two shot. As it stands now you either get dominated or fight some low level. A level playing field would have made it an AMAZING mode.
---
It really all depends what build you make, you can get almost 10000 damage with a rifle build using a dragon or 3-5000 with melee with the right build
---
  Saw a map of his "route" a couple weeks ago, and someone recently asked to have it reposted.  
---
T he times I saw him, he dd not materialize in front of me, so I guess he walks - although I once I did see moo-moo run by at hyperspeed (for a brahmin)....
---
Also read he appeared a few times during the parade last week, and that at once in a while, he helps defend workshops and such.
---
The dragon has 4 projectiles, so total damage = 4 x (1/4 total damage),  which will do less actual damage when DR is factored in.
---
He won't be able to trade it. It's an ATOM Store item.
---
Isn‚Äôt the entire game still beta....lololololol
---
i know that it was confirmed but nobody seems to be discussing what they look like now that we have images
---
You can find the plan for it at Treetops next to the workbench or inside the building at NAR repair yard
---
It would be a toss up between the Fatman and the black powder rifles without any perks. With perks but without legendaries the dragon is the best form of single target damage
---
Whats the point of the game? 
---
Yeah that was my thoughts, but I know they fiddled with pvp damage so nobody gets one shot. This is why I wanted a new character to use as cannon fodder
---
Even with a couple  20% weapon reduction T3 perks on my armour, my Handmade, shotgun and all my other rifles hover around the 10lb mark.. With my Bear-Arms Rank 3 perk card, though, my heavy weapons kinda offset the weight, as my TS Fatman, Gatling plasma, missile launcher and Furious Gatling laser together weigh in at half of my handmade.
---
It also doesn't help that there's no weight reduction perks for rifles...yet there's one for pistols, heavy weapons and shotguns....Rifleman perks should decrease the weight of them a bit. Or have a "commando" perk that makes them weigh less.  I'm to the point where, I don't care what the primary perk of a 3\* piece of armour is, if it's got 20% weapon reduction on it, I'll wear it. Heck, I got one last night with Assassin on it, completely useless but it's got 20% weapon reduction, so I'm gonna use it, it replaced my 3\* Mutant's combat leg that reduced ammo by 20%. Swapping to the Assassin leg dropped my carry weight by at least 15pts
---
I've been running all possible weight reduction perks and gear as possible...I have maxed strength, maxed strong back and what not but on average, my carry weight hovers around 280 out of a possible 335-330. My ammo weighs nothing, aside from the mini nukes I carry and fusion cores. Thanks to a couple ammo reduction perks on my T3 armour. 
---
In Watoga on the south track line there‚Äôs a rail car he plan can spawn in. 
---
This also makes events ‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù since you can‚Äôt opt out of an event other than leaving the area right?
---
Thanks. I'll look for it when I get online.
---
I see, what if you are assassins and going agi just of the survivability in the DR perk and Dodgy?
---
Greifing was the wrong word, I think exploiting would have been a better choice on my part. My concern is I think the bounty system is really cool, I like it and want it to work but the way it is implemented now mans it will rarely be used and even more rarely used as intended. When a friend kills me with a bounty in PVE I get my caps, when a friend kills me with a bounty  in PVP I get your caps, thats a big difference in my eyes. 
---
I have no idea what that has to do with the game displaying your public IP address instead of your name for the whole map to see.
---
I agree 100%, they should‚Äôve never allowed character transfers. It muddies the water. It would‚Äôve forced people to start honestly from scratch, plus made people play the game twice as much. But that said, they are listening and could easily implement that change later. 
---
BOS combat  armor and deep pocketed mods are still missing from vendors too iirc 
---
please dont include ACTUAL gamers with whiners :(
---
No it‚Äôs a horrible idea to use your real name online. Danny Smith would probably name his character Danny Smith because he doesn‚Äôt get it. 
---
&gt;Ah yes, one quest...
---
Hm, there's much more than one quest, bud. You're being obtuse.
---
You really should just leave this subreddit, if you dislike the game that much. Stop wasting your time (and ours) being a prick about a game you don't even play.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôve never been able to use them. I click, nothing happens. So I just sell them. 
---
I can verify both. He just does not venture into the cranberry bog area. Least i never seen him
---
I also favor the instigating weapons, as i like to be sneaky sneaky 
---
If you want to be like that we can say every game ever put out is still in beta with constant updates ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_wetsuit_(Fallout_76)  This right?
---
It‚Äôs the machine. It has all the parts to look  it. The locker the computer so on 
---
My quest progress reset due some server bullshitery and I need to do it again. I plan on doing it around tomorrow. You can tag along if you want.
---
Well damn, I kept a vampires with ts of these in my stash for ages.  I wonder if it‚Äôs still there.
---
So gimp myself purposefully? What is this argument? Should not a game be designed to have the player engaged according to the gear choices the devs decided to include in the game themselves? 
---
Trying to play a game within a game seems like mental gymnastics. Using up 10 stimpaks just so I can have to go grind more later seems... odd. 
---
I'm looking for content that forces me to adapt using every measure at my disposal allowed by the devs. Hence the content of the post title. 
---
even if you're not a griefer I don't give free rides to freeloaders...
---
As in all things, actions will eventually speak louder than words. Thanks for the tip friend. 
---
Assuming that you mean weapons that benefit from Rifleman perks:
---
Dragon &gt; BP Rifle &gt; Gauss Rifle &gt; Hunting Rifle (perf mag) &gt; Lever Rifle
---
The gauss is the top rifle that mounts scopes and a suppressor. If you don't like the charging then there's the next two.
---
is the bug still active where pistol and rifle perks apply to the pipe guns tho? I mean, reddit cant handle it when I express my opinions, so if I said what I REALLY want people would FREAK THE F OUT, but imo damage buffs and leveled weapons have no place in surival either. I think all guns and damage should be equal with the exception of what mods and weapons you have unlocked. I also think it should be full body loot. So how does the game play then? Less emphasis on farming legendaries (leave that in adventure mode) and more emphasis on materials and unlocked plans. You die, you gotta either grab a backup gun from the stash or make a new one. 
---
Yup
---
Where‚Äôs NAR repair yard? I‚Äôm looking for this also lmao
---
Duped stealthboys already ruined it for me, squads of four running full sentinels spamming stealth boys completely killed the fun. 
---
Fair point. Admittedly I don't fast travel often, so I've never paid much attention. Even so, I don't really see a problem with people using adventure mode to fast travel. If people want to go through the trouble of changing modes, more power to 'em. I won't be. I've been trying to get a recipe for healing salve in the Ash Heap for the last several playthroughs. I even set up a camp next to the Mt Blair Train Station for the Battle Bot event. Did it every time I logged in. But I don't have the patience to server hop. But there are plenty of folks who will (or would, idk anymore) server hop the shit out of WS for legendaries.
---
I agree. And to be clear for those who apparently don't know, "this fucking sucks" is NOT constructive criticism.
---
yeah thats kinda what I was thinking. I love immersion, and that would be a way for there to be a semi safe zone without a heavy handed mechanic 
---
there was literally a new patch today...  so what you did yesterday might have changed today...
---
DR IS A DISTRACTION!!! IT DOESNT MATTER!
---
secret agent. Evasive. AP Passive. Action boy and if you are cavaliers reduced aprint ap cost is nice.
---
If you're using Cav or Crits, sure, don't use Dodgy. But if you're using neither, a full Unyielding set gives you tons of AP, and when you add in Action Boy, Lone Wanderer, Nerd Rage and Rejuvenated, not to mention any food or other armor bonuses, you can run Dodgy all day (as long as you're not doing dumb stuff like face-tanking a minigun Super Mutant).
---
What's your level?
---
People are reporting that one shot is still possible. Albeit with mixed successes. 
---
i 100% agree with that now.  exploited?  I can see that.  is it griefing?  absolutely not.  
---
2
---
What guns do you currently have a use?
---
if you ever played Frost mod for fallout 4, that is essentially my dream for 76. a multiplayer version of that 
---
follow the tracks west from watoga station. its walking distance. Theres also a lil image on the map
---
Supposedly can kill sentinels with staggers from enforcer and tank killer (?) perks.
---
I think we have different understandings of the way the system was intended to work and what its goal was. I don't think the devs thought this up as a way for people to get more caps off their victims.  More importantly It will simply result in people not using the system and thus a missed opportunity. 
---
Thanks lol seems no one wants to sell haha
---
You the kinda person that‚Äôs a bit of a twat?
---
Jog on lad. üëèüèª
---
It'll be a lot easier once they get it up on Steam.  
---
I used a vintage and it was giving credit for the challenge. 
---
The Aiden: Squeaks loudly into his mic, breathing even louder, immediately hits you with a team invite, followed by a Close Friend request, followed by a party invite. Followed by another party invite. Follows you around the wasteland like your personal escort asking you to drop him chems. Shoots you when you ignore him.
---
i just read a post by a guy on PC who had this happen today...
---
hope there is not a new bug going around
---
I don‚Äôt like there are weapon skins exclusive to the bundle
---
The worse part about this sort of shit, is people will openly defend this sort of behaviour and tell the victims to get good. They should have chose to hold off survival till the duping glitch had better prevention measures.  It's bad enough that you can bring your high level characters in
---
This happend to me as well I just kept closing application and opening till it worked lol
---
I think it was my reactive plates.   Took it off in favor of a jetpack.  Havent had the issue since.
---
Testing how fast you can lose all your progress? :))
---
LOL that's actually a thing? We had two cats growing up. One was pure white, which my dad named Charmin (after the toilet paper), and the other was black - brown - orange calico, which he dubbed "Shithead", pronounced Shih-theed. 10 year old me was very impressed.
---
honestly i think i prefer the smaller slower influx of new players..
---
i play an MMORPG FFXIV, and recently it got alot of new players that come in from WoW because it being sucky right now, and while the FF community mostly is really, REALLY kind, the WoW players are... well.. lets just say that you know if someone is a WoW refugee by looking at the chat..
---
It's all over but the crying....
---
Stil is the rifle with the highest potency of damage in a single shot
---
Bethesda should never have made anything transferrable to a new mode, esp given the huge amount of dupes still in game. 
---
It defeats the entire purpose, I mean, how can you keep making these basic mistakes?
---
Do they even know what the hell their doing over there?  It‚Äôs like the company‚Äôs run by clueless interns.
---
Obviously they do want it to be a success. But it's too garbo atm.
---
Cheers, I might give that a try 
---
In addition to the already-mentioned Contractor perk, growing food at workshops with a food resource is significantly faster than growing it at your camp. So if you have a challenge like crafting X amount of alcohol, it's easier to do it that way than to use a camp garden. 
---
If you like fallout for the lore and questline, it's there but it's not spoon fed to you.  The most interesting characters are a handful of robots with personalities. I'd say if this is why you like fallout, to avoid.
---
If you like fallout for exploration, cool explosions and freedom/flexibility, then I'd say it's one of the better ones for that.
---
I think it depends on your play style.
---
Auto rifles vs sniper, 
---
Auto rifles throw lots of lead downwind, within a specific range.
---
Sniper, puts limited amounts of bullets in strategic places in a longer range.
---
Your call on how you play.
---
So far I like it.....going up against teams is proving to be costly. Going to wait a day and see if I can still afford to play survival. 
---
I have bloody mess (I switch it out as needed) and I also jack myself up on ballistic bock and chems.  144 is just my base lmao 
---
I encourage everyone to make a new character.  Try something new.  Maybe pick up some of those achievements you might have missed by playing the BETA.  At the very least, getting Atoms quickly cause you level up and do things in areas you might have left behind.
---
I wouldn't go in and risk losing a lot of aid and caps. 
---
Whaaaaaa I paid $50,000 for a brand new truck and two years later after driving the shit out of it, somebody bought it used for $25,000...
---
This isn‚Äôt fair.... I wanna my money back 
---
But he was ghoulified, so it does mean he would have died from radiation poisoning if he hadn't turned into a ghoul.
---
Or how fast you can destroy your controller or keyboard?
---
Everyone has this problem. The loss is random. Don't carry all your stimpacks next time.
---
You dont have a point!  You dont understand the game takes half the bounty. Your complaining about a 50 cap return on a 200 cap investment!!!!!
---
There is no exploit! Go back to adventure!
---
So, let‚Äôs continue to fuck over ranged sniper builds and let melee champ on....sounds legit. 
---
Lol, I saw that post of that guy losing 180 stim packs. That‚Äôs balls, but, you know.  Beta. 
---
It‚Äôs like getting on a roller coaster built in a third world country. Sure, it may eventually be awesome. But you can bet your ass I won‚Äôt be the first to ride. 
---
Nooooo! It‚Äôs a fluke?! üò≠ that makes me so sad..
---
Wtf that‚Äôs insane 
---
On the chance you‚Äôre not a troll, white springs turret bases effectively make it so you can‚Äôt farm the area for loot because the turrets kill so fast. Other people are trying to farm the area, and since that ruins it for others, your base is going to get leveled.
---
PvPing in power armor? Tisk tisk. Even my melee characters bloodied lever could kill you in a hit or two, no need to run all the way over there and punch you ;).
---
I one shot everything except scorchbeasts and ultra high level deathclaws with my switchblade. It out performs my sledge, because I can get multiple stabs in in the blink of an eye.
---
I don't wear power armor, but I was passing the trainyard when I heard a Sentry Bot unloading on someone, so I went to investigate. 
---
2 low levels were hiding in a box car, so I drew agro and dispatched the thing. Felt good.
---
They came out and threw up the heart hands, then followed me around for a bit.
---
this, the only thing im bothered by right now is that youre basicly "set" with a character.. i want to change my build, but i dont want to start a new character and re-unlock all the plans and fast travels ive made..
---
but earning 40+ levels just to change my weapon type... hurts.
---
Have an Instigating Revolutionary Sword with both power attack legendary effects. It puts things down
---
You can only fast travel to Camp, vault 76, and stations. But, I get your point.
---
The only pricks here are the ones writing fanfic about "how they've underestimated the game on launch" when nothing changed at all. You pricks gave undecidet buyers false impressions on launch when things were at its worst, what swept people like me in here to begin with but now i'm supposed to leave cause i'm not buying it? How about no, bud?
---
I was bad boi, now when there is survival i am going to mothman church i build, praising our lord to protec me from xxxpussyeaterxxx
---
Yeah I had fun for all of 40 minutes and that ruined it for me, I was super excited for this game mode to drop but the fact that this happened within an hour of the update says alot about how frequently this is happening. 
---
That's what he was saying. Ass.
---
&gt; Will you change your perks? 
---
No, why? The most of the perks work same way to PVP as they have for PVE. There is basically only two modes when it comes to perk loadout- crafting mode &amp; combat mode.
---
&gt; Will you avoid the most popular farming areas, or seek them out? 
---
There is no point seeking PVP in farming areas. If it happens it happens, but there is just no point sitting in farming area hoping that someone comes to there. You want PVP, just hunt top 3 players and kill anyone along the way.
---
&gt; What makes you interested in Survival Mode? 
---
It makes playerbase colorful. Take the adventure mode. you never see the good people. Because the game forces everyone to be "good" people. If everyone is good, no one is good. In survival mode you don't have that. If you meet player who doesn't attack you, you know he isn't being forced not to attack me, but he choose not to attack you and that what makes that player more "good" than any of the players in adventure mode. And this kind of unknown situations, where you don't who you are going to meet, is what makes Survival Mode interesting.
---
&gt; Do you have any tips or tricks that you're willing to share with more casual players? 
---
Berry Mentas == Wallhack
---
&gt; Are you playing solo, have a group, or looking for a group? 
---
Solo
---
&gt; Are you planning to play Survival Mode exclusively, or will you switch back and forth? 
---
Probably most of the time going to play Survival, if I am playing actively.
---
&gt; Will you actively seek out PvP, or just do your normal play style and hope for the best? 
---
Most of the times probably will play normally and none hostile. 
---
&gt; What if someone nukes Fissure Prime or Whitesprings? Will you risk it? 
---
Not gonna prioritize it, but I'll do it If I have nothing else to do.
---
Plz stash your aid.   Same reason you do it for junk.  Cmonnnnnn
---
Okay most of that stuff didn't make sense but I will say that I wanted to do melee but I also think it'd be fun to have a Vats side of my player as well. So do use Vats often especially in PvP I will need lots of AP correct? So what's the best way to go about that with this type of build? Unyielding?
---
Thanks! Good luck to you too!
---
Tattered dress
---
I managed to plink off some health with a level 5 shotgun on a lvl 71 character in x01.  I had fun for the 10 minutes I got to play. 
---
People are just mad they would have to make a new character and level it. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt do that that. Plus the mules. 
---
I doubt they will revert the rule to use fresh. Unless there is 100% backlash. Which right now isn‚Äôt. 
---
Thats not my concern. My concern is that as is its very easy for players to profit from bounties being placed on them and that is not what the devs wanted the system to be. 
---
It means ANY RANGED SNIPER pvp is, was, and will always be dead in the water whilst melee continues to be the only way to pvp.
---
Survival mode :P
---
I did destroy small table i have next to my couch. Because apex. No more emotions for stupid games.
---
Lol be ready for a... Really?? 
---
So like I said I'm currently running Melee because ... Reasons.
---
1) all-rise 2) an anti-armor rev sword in goes 50%armor and reflects 50% blocked Melee damage with 1+str and 3) an assassin's pickaxe that has 50% limb damage and +str. 
---
My guns are simple. Brotherhood recon, civil unrest, perfect storm, a pipe rifle, an antibiotic armor ultracite pistol 1star, a quad barrel handmade that also does 40% bonus bash damage. 
---
Yep... That's it... 
---
It's a plan. I think you can buy it from a vendor (not the atom shop.) It's very confusing because the name is different depending on if you are buying the plan or placing it in your camp. At work so trying to remember but, could be called Brahmin pen or fertilizer producer. 
---
This is not a problem based on the mechanics of the mode but on your item management.
---
I did wonder if the gauss is bugged. It has the higher numbers but didn't seem effective to me. The aimpoint's wrong on the reflex sight anyway so I didn't try it for long.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna have to worry much about griefers..
---
This patch only allows swear damage.. lolz
---
I played pretty close to 100 events, not a single rare mask received.  None of the crews I played with over the 100‚Äôs of events either
---
You should pray, For XxNekoRAwRxX is almost upon us
---
Me too. I'm sure they'll tweak it in the coming weeks/months based on player feedback.
---
some of these already have been ingame since last week (red enamal stove and diamond eye paint)
---
This is kinda why I tend to reserve judgement for some games until further down the road unless there is something I tend to just straight up dislike about the game. The list of games that are "shit/bad" on release and become good later on down the road is surprisingly long. Hell, some of my favourite games fall into that category; I've put thousands of hours into Destiny and it fell into that same category until The Taken King.
---
That's good to know. I hadn't seen that yet. But there's still the question of will people actually do events in Survival. Even if PvP is disabled during the event, there's still the threat of that lvl 180 in PA gunning you down as soon as the event ends. Hell, I worry about that now in Adventure mode. I don't want Bethesda to take away that lvl 180's ability to kill me for what we just earned together, though. They wanna betray someone they don't know? Fine. But that's just my opinion. What will the majority think, and how will their opinions drive their actions? Will the increased XP be enough motivation for people to take the risk? I hope so.
---
Plans should be account-wide. There's no reason not to have to re-collect everything by rolling over a new character (this isn't an mmo). And yeah, changing your build time is brutal. You need levels to get the cards, then more levels to swap over the SPECIAL points... and there's no simple way of going back and forth between them.
---
I'll let you know tomorrow. My tine zone is GMT+5.30 so let me know when you'll be free by yout time zone and we can figure something out. I'm mostly free tomorrow.
---
Thanks. Will keep an eye out for it 
---
I just got one hit by a non power armour lvl 40 with tse marapusial whilst I had xo1????? How is this fair 
---
Forgot to reply to your reply
---
Life giver and rejuvenated to boost hp is good (max nerd rage, +20% damage +40 DR, kicking in at 80hp is way better then at 60hp).
---
Oh, whoops. Misread the intent of the thread.
---
And this chair. And this remote control. And this Thermos.
---
Yeah in real life prices and deals change and arise but you can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
How many times did it happen to you?
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking lol. My Handmade will make quick work of that PA
---
you bet your ass ill buy that "survival" statue to celebrate doom eternal  (is it just me or does it really give a DOOM feel?)
---
I have no sympathy. Bethesda came out ahead of time and said that you would loose aid items. So why are people running around with all their aid items on them rather than keeping most in stash.
---
Hi there, I've seen some of your posts and it seems you've done a lot of theory crafting and experimentation and I would love it if you could answer some of my questions (recently came back to the game and am not able to test my builds).
---
I was curious to how effective DR and the "Dodgy" perk is when it comes to survivability. Is grabbing ironclad, evasive, dodgy, and bringing AGI up to 15 for defensive reasons worth it? Or would it be better to go vats crit build and more offensive oriented? I get they both have their pros and cons, but I was leaning towards a more defensive oriented build for more general purposes and not having to rely on stealth. Would going defensive allow me to fight one hit builds or will I get one hit anyways?
---
Or you could just blueprint your camp before you hop into pvp
---
Yeah I‚Äôm positive. I wanted a pink skin and I previously saw them both datamined so I waited until they were both in the store to compare prices. The corvega skin is pink with chrome embellishment and the solcum joe was pink with yellow embellishment. When it finally hit the store the preview images showed sprinkles on the skin. I was like wtf? That‚Äôs not in the atom shop image... it was just yellow and pink. Now this new image shows sprinkles. I‚Äôm sure there were people who bought it based on the yellow/pink scheme and then asked for a refund when they realized it had sprinkles on it. So, now they‚Äôve uploaded an accurate image.
---
I‚Äôve read people actively hunting right at the vault. Which sucks if you can‚Äôt even leave the vault without getting killed. 
---
Maybe enter with just bare essentials? 
---
Yeah that's basically what this ENTIRE post is about... Way to catch on... Also I'm a lady :) 
---
Gah! Thanks. I didn't even realize. &lt;3
---
For Survival Mode (Beta), will there be (or are there any talks for) any kind of matchmaking/balancing to join players of a similar level or PVP stats on the same world? Given the "join game" feature, this would obviously require some additional restrictions.
---
I love the ballistic bock but the 15% kills me. My lever has half of the max durability and doubled with the 200% repair and just doesn‚Äôt last long. 
---
Yas queen.
---
OP is complaining about a 50 cap return on a 200 cap investment!! LOL
---
I PUT A BOUNTY ON YOU. COSTS ME 200 CAPS
---
100 CAP BOUNTY IS DISPLAYED/REWARDED FROM MY INVESTMENT
---
I SPLIT THAT WITH SOMEONE.. I GET 50 CAPS BACK.
---
WOW WHAT AN EXPLOIT.... THIS WILL MAKE ME RICH!!!!!
---
I get my best stuff through trades. If I know that a friend is looking for something to compliment their build I hold on to it for them. They so the same for me. Otherwise hover at the vendors. Easier to farm them for some decent stuff. Some folks don't want that 3* bloodied handmade so they sell it at a vendor because it's easier than digging it around. 
---
Except the price didn't went down 50% and the product didn't wear down. The products just went down what, 90%
---
&gt;...Yet you somehow deduced that it's suspect that a lawyer was present?
---
What I'm suggesting is that you're wasting your time coming in here to complain about a game you don't even play.
---
On one hand I appreciate you taking one for the team, on the other hand I think it was incredibly stupid of you to go running around with 100+ stims on you.
---
I would be interested in that rifle build your talking about lol 
---
well it snot 100% positive either...
---
im sure Bethesda will adjust things after a week or two
---
How do you know the weapon is two shot? Just curious if you have any idea about what your talking about or not.    Sure it wasn't instigating explosive? Or anti armor explosive? Assassins explosive? Or anything else? Lol.  Go farm Wes Tek on adventure mode until a weapon you want drops. 
---
It's going to end up like ark. These people will scare off any potential new players and will cause the servers to die off slowly. If Bethesda made no player transfers and fixed duping I guarantee it would have been one of the best game modes of any game this year. The idea of going around the waste being afraid to come across players. Not knowing wether the next face you meet would be a friendly one, or the last face you see. All it is now is cunts running around with unarmed weapons and legendary armour with low health. 
---
I rather do daily for BIV and then go sleep. Feeling positive. Haha (i was super excited in pvp back when nobody was, killing people on workshops, hoping they make something how fked they did it)
---
My favorite drop I personally looted is a 3 star Junkie's with explosive and +VATs refill
---
I‚Äôm surprised this many people are that instantly hostile. Literally level 6 with hardly any loot. 
---
I figured it would be a little more civil, like the higher level players would fuck each other up and the lower levels would duke it out. Since, what‚Äôs the point for a higher level to attack a lower level other than to be a dick? 
---
atleast the cards are a one time thing, but yeah, id love a respec option thatll wipe your (bought) cards and points back to 0 so you can buy new cards and pick new points.
---
the current system is great for making small changes (like how i changed 2 points to be able to use mutations), but yeah, a respec for either caps or atoms would be great
---
Yeah! Sorry, I tried really hard to get that stimpack into you but I was too slow.
---
Why is it bad for players? PvPers have a place to go know. We get to to stay right in our cozy adventure mode. All your missing out on is a 20% xp buff.
---
Let's the PvPers have their game mode. They are punished too hard in adventure so they have a place to go now. 
---
Appearing on the map as the Longest Life is complete and utterly broken. Want to make a new character? There is zero point in Survival since people can bring in their super high level pre-existing characters with amazing gear, see your ass on the map, and just destroy you. If you didn't drop a SUBSTANTIAL portion of your Aid (losing most of your Stimpacks at a low level is fucking retarded unless you wanna waste time crafting tons of healing salve / relying on food) and your junk. You are actively punished for LIVING. Again for a pre-existing character of high level maybe not an issue but a new character, just trying to gather *basic crafting materials, ya know like lead, aluminum, steel* you're fucked plain as day. As soon as you hit the top of the Longest Alive leader board you are open to the world. There is zero point of even "testing" this in it's current state, it's a griefers paradise unless you take in a pre-existing character with good gear. The fucked up part is we told Bethesday this last fuckin week before they even launched this "beta".
---
Bump..
---
I‚Äôve seen low lvl 30s in watoga.
---
....watcha wearing...?
---
&gt;What's the difference? None. The restrictions are arbitrary.
---
Actually... Big difference and restrictions are needed.
---
You make 10 camps and potentially force 10 people loading into a server to find another where their location isn't settled.
---
I had a base just outside of Harpers Ferry and I found that the mortars were nice for clearing out parts of the town. I used to go through and kill all of the super mutants in town for scrap and caps, and so I got a lot of millage out of those cannons. It works best as an opening move. The time between when you throw and when the barrage starts is really long so it‚Äôs hard to use in a fight, but it‚Äôs great for softening people up ahead of time. Just like real mortars I guess
---
Watoga train station should have them
---
Do you see how you took my words out of context. If your going to quote me atleast do it properly. 
---
**This is only a game**, and real-life feeling is not applicable here.  When another player bumps into me, I'm thinking he had better not have pain train on, not whether he has "feelings" for me.
---
They can easily implement fast travel solutions in world that would work for both camps, like vertibirds that can still be shot down and are not magically making you teleport 
---
I feel it‚Äôs time based. Sometimes it‚Äôs trash. Other times it‚Äôs a gold mine. 
---
R/quityourbullshit
---
Upgrade that tattered dress to garb..lolz
---
Yup i use 2h supersledge. 
---
If i see a sentinal i could
---
A) try to hit him 2x+. A stagger then a finishing shot.
---
B) Vats crit him in one shot.
---
 Option B has a higher success rate from my experience. 
---
It was a laugh.  I was time-restricted so only did it twice.
---
First time, myself and two others did it near-perfectly, but the second time about 12 people showed up and we lost several revelers!
---
Got an owl mask and a scary dude mask.  Meh rewards, but a change of pace, and good humour again from the devs.
---
I'll just play games without auto-aim if I want to play against other people. 
---
I definitely haven‚Äôt had that experience, coming from someone who made a fresh character. Constantly being picked off by level 80-200. I don‚Äôt see the point, considering lower levels drop less loot than higher level characters, they have better loot potential.  
---
Do you complain to the grocery store when you buy a case of soda and then 2 weeks later they put it on sale?
---
That would give an advantage to players who are starting survival now. If I manage to convince my friend to get the game in 6 months, why would he waste time with a low level survival character that keeps getting killed by everyone whose been on for 6 months. Allowing you to switch between them means u can set up your character in adventure then play survival when you think you‚Äôre ready. 
---
&gt;People are utilizing the same bullcrap where they mark a low level player with either a bounty or the leaderboard and then stomping people they lure in. Seriously, a level 20 guarded by 5 level 200x wrecking anyone they see, chasing people down w/ explosive shotguns and the like. I‚Äôll try it again and stay away from the PVP I suppose but isn‚Äôt that the point of it?
---
An easy fix for that...  stop trying to hunt down the easy marks and falling for traps.  This complaint is "OMG, I tried to be a jerk and kill a person much lower level than me.  But instead a bunch of people who were higher level than me killed me!  So unfair and wrong!".
---
C'mon man stop that defeatist mindset.  It only takes a few minutes to get 500 caps worth for real.   If you loot assault rifles off mutants then sell to vendor for 200 caps your half way there.  
---
That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs saying that it‚Äôs concerning that people who have heavily invested in rifle builds that put there effectiveness into high dmg per shot and slow reload and fire rate of fire, because those builds won‚Äôt have dps that some other low dmg high fire rate guns will, thus may cause it to not be balanced, this will obviously depend how much dmg they are limiting per shot so I guess we will have to see.
---
Wow you weren't kidding lol. The anti armor sword is a decent roll though... I'm going to save this Post and the next time I get something good I'll give you first dibs on buying.
---
u on xbox? i can craft u one just need the materials
---
I've also seen the clubhouse full of eyebots. Every single one was legendary, though, and even though they were all level 1, they were dropping all levels of legendary items. 
---
Wouldn't mind seeing that happen again.
---
It didn't actually.
---
At around 7am Eastern or 11 UTC (as they posted in the article) any server that restarted lost the event. 
---
I spent around 30 minutes server hopping in my region before realizing that. But I was able to join servers outside of my region that hadn't restarted yet via the friends list and could still do the event there.
---
Thanks but I'm on PC 
---
That used to be a thing? I totally would have done that. All CAMP objects unlocked, heck ya.
---
Quit falling for the trap?
---
Good lord, what the fuck do you people want?
---
When it comes to gun fights, I get picked off before I can get anywhere remotely close to killing them with starting weapons since most roll in with explosive this or that weapon with a scope on it. 
---
The only thing I‚Äôve seen so far is melee being viable, but then again you have to get close enough to hit them. 
---
Except in your example you are using 50%, try more like: PS4 on release 400 bucks and then 1 or 2 months later 50 bucks. 
---
C'mon peeps, donuts is NOT GOOD FOR YOU, you might get the Diabetes:  Here lieth Scorchkiller, slain 150 SBs without fail, but ate one too many Kruellers.
---
BTW between the shift key and the tab key is a button called "caps lock" yours appears to be stuck in the on position. 
---
I'm quite happy to have the five-shot explosive assholes in their containment server. I won't be going back, since all I got was one-shotted whereever I went, from people camping at train station spawn-points.
---
That temporary "invulnerability" while spawning in obviously doesn't work. The bodies were piling up.
---
I will!
---
Even then though, what happens when the top 3 players all face roll me and I still want to PVP? Just server hop I guess.
---
All of my toons are high level and geared out, but as in any game, you always run into people that are god mode compared to you. If the top 3 are all these god mode players it would be nice to have a way to still find others on the map, or hell, even broadcast your own location on the map.
---
Then don't complain?
---
Quell the numbers. Maintain the status quo. 
---
90% you say?
---
If it hates you, then it bothers you. They are definitely tied together at the hip.
---
haha this is so true lol. We do have a decent community 
---
It does and I'm sorry if I came across badly. It's becoming a thing online to ignore people who use profanities when expressing opinions. I assumed wrong with your post. 
---
Must be what happened to me. I joined a friends game and we did a couple parades. 
---
Thank-you, Maaaaaaaaaaaaaa'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam.
---
What else do you drop
---
Lmao that‚Äôs real sick since I made my character uglier then sin. 
---
I'll be honest, I haven't played much in the past couple of months and haven't tried placing down the camp like that since December, but it worked them. The hard part is placing the blueprint back where it was, the game doesn't like doing that sometimes but everything should be in storage and repaired.
---
Most of the time I have enough to repair everything but crops, with crops you just scrap them and you get the crop back, so all you lose it a tiny bit of fertilizer. I think the only things that are a pain to repair all the time are the rad scrubbers, everything else I usually have enough to repair.
---
Huh. Was unaware.
---
I think you should rotate that image, and then upload it.  It views awkwardly on imgur...
---
I can near guarantee this is coming. The automatron assets are already in game and it's on the roadmap. [My speculation](https://i.imgur.com/j2ppQFD.png)
---
This is old info two shot dragons don't get near 10000 after the nerf, Bloodied explosive maybe.
---
Huh.
---
So griefers can still trash your camp? Just not you?
---
Hadn‚Äôt considered that.
---
And this is bethesda's problem how?
---
Better dead than red. 
---
That's an issue. It is a beta though, so report it as a bug and Bethesda will fix it 
---
I can craft one on PC.
---
The irony is I came from Ark originally, played official servers for years, instead of bred gigas ppl have assassins sentinel or even crazier unyielding sentinel. 
---
Ye I think the one he was using was a two shot explosive dragon
---
I had a lot of fun in survival this morning. Back to adventure mode to scrounge up some more ammo to keep the fight going. 
---
TSE is still decent as long as you don't use vats. It gives a 25 increase in damage comapred to AA's 28%. I actually like TSE over AAE because I can almost max out AA elsewhere and TS gives me a second explosion. Bloodied explosive does the most damage but its suicidal in pvp when anyone can oneshot you.
---
500 caps is way overpaying. 200 is market rate
---
Place on map?
---
You may be right, idk
---
But with XP boosts from Inspirational, you'll be leveling rapidly &amp; thus improving your ability to withstand damage ;)
---
I‚Äôm sure you can‚Äôt to a Vendor, but can they be sold to a player?
---
Bethesda isn't smart enough to do regional release. They do everything manually.
---
I put floodlights next to my turrets. Helps especially at night.
---
Let me try to find it before I consider it thanks. 
---
Nooo, so much pain because people. Sometimes is just better to murder someone on the street.
---
Give it up - stick a fork in it.  Bethesda failed to listen to feedback, thousands of people have been saying for months that allowing adventure mode characters is a BIG mistake.  They are most certainly NOT listening to Survival mode feedback before releasing the BETA, what makes anyone think they'll actually listen to feedback now?
---
That's how things work in game and real life. I was an early adopter of 4K in my circle of friends, now they buying better 4K tvs than mine for half the price. But i was the go to for movie nights for about two years lol.
---
You can't hold your self on buying something because it might be cheaper in a month or two, enjoy it now why worry about saving Atoms for the future. Most of the items that will go on sale for the next week is where my Atoms are going, i have a few ideas for the Vault Boy Gnome. 
---
The griefing I was thinking of was being extra cruel to others in hopes of making them mad enough to place a bounty. 
---
Lucky you; I have three characters over 50 and only today managed to get past two golfers. 
---
Nah but I complained when ESO did it with their DLC bundle. Actually asked customer support if they could help me since I bought one about a week before they did it that was the same amount. After they looked at my account they were allowed to refund the first purchase so I could buy the second, their CS is actually pretty good
---
It's cool, i likely worded my initial comment badly. I have nothing against language or enotional responses and comments, but when someone refuses to actually explain what they're criticizing or how to improve it, it infuriates me.
---
The keyword in "constructive criticism" is CONSTRUCTIVE. You don't like the thing? Fine. How would you like it to be better? Don't just talk shit for shittalking's sake.
---
even then it wouldn't reach 10000. 
---
It is fearure. They did make it so if you holster weapon, you are shown as friendly. It is meant to be rust76. Haha
---
For me, I think that Adventure mode is kind of offering that. IMO this new mode is to satisfy the players like me who just want to PVP all day. Yes, farm and quest, but only to gain more power for PVP. I think if they're making a new game mode it should be all-in to making itself vastly different from the other game mode. -- Totally respect your opinion though, and ultimately it's up to Beth to decide which direction to go.
---
IDK how to. I tried.i took the pic in landscape mode which is usually auto rotates it.IDK why it isnt doing it now.
---
Yeah, he did Gourmand's then it sent him back to the trappers', then back to Maggie's, then to the trappers' again, then to Blackwater Mine, then back after Gourmand, and so on. It took 3 days. I think I ended up in the wendigo cave with him 3 times and he did it twice more. But, hey, screws. 
---
For the record I wouldn‚Äôt want this mode any other way, I feel like the overall toxicity will die down after a bit. Killing level 2‚Äôs will get boring eventually. 
---
It would have been nice to force you to use a new character as today would have been a hell of a lot more enjoyable and interesting to say the least. More so than constantly getting picked off by no fault of my own. 
---
I'm going to guess your in the minority when you say low levels wasted you as you wasted them. It won't be fun when you run into players running unkillable one shot builds
---
I would love one with anti armor +50%limb damage , and damage resist while reloading 
---
Yawn
---
It would still be a decent 5000 tho but Ye might‚Äôve changed with the recents buffs they made 
---
That is different than pacifist mode...
---
How come I get downvoted when I say the same thing as you? 
---
I look forward to seeing how the new mode is when I get home. What specifically makes it "garbo" in your opinion?
---
I know for a fact there is a random encounter spot [here](https://imgur.com/a/jXVcjtp). Where the added red dot is. Just up the road on the right from the greenhouses/workshops. I saw a nuke there one time and was so excited. I never even got to clip the wores because the game crashed when i brought up Nvidia to record it.
---
He just probably watched that youtube video by rifleman gaming a long time ago that had the title 10000 dmg rifleman build
---
I didn't though. You are mad you can't pve in a PvP oriented game mode. Play adventure mode. Problem solved. 
---
Im exicted to play it and do some fun stuff. Please share your experience with the Mode wanna hear some Opinions.
---
Also 1 Shots OP yes or no?
---
I mean in the end its a 2 Shot Fatman with max Demolition Rank.
---
No way!  I need 11 separate entries of the Hornwright Alpha Keycard and 11 separate entries of the Hornwright Beta Keycard.
---
Rad shield glowing blood pack and glowing fungus soup 
---
Let's put it this way it took me 700 hours to find ppl who spam stealthboys in pvp as soon as the new survival mode dropped it took me 40 minutes. Once was enough for me I lose over 400 caps each death because I'm level 216 on my main. 
---
a rifle DOES NOT weight 25 lbs, this is absurd. 
---
Odds are it may work in your favor... Inaccurate, delayed and otherwise misleading not to mention distracting! 
---
Well to be honest this is what players wanted. They wanted the Raiders to leave adventure mode and go to Survival mode. So be prepared for more posts about this honestly.
---
Wow I forgot about the elevators. Would be the perfect beginning foundation for a camp. 
---
Except in real life things get cheaper after few years not after few weeks (except F76 game price)
---
And teaming with anyone with a workshop.
---
Yep, ark is always my example when describing a game that caters to a small minority playerbase. Atleast in ark when new game modes came out they had the decency to prevent cross transfer.
---
Exactly. They made it very clear that this would happen and everyone‚Äôs like OMG IM LOOSING AID THIS IS BROKEN. It‚Äôs not broken. 
---
If you save the picture to your computer you can easily rotate it clockwise/ccw with the default windows picture viewer.
---
Ah nice :)
---
Yep. Definitely need that one too. 
---
Though quite a few alts have been thankful for some of the gear i've given away. 
---
I'm not at all, you've completely missed my point. I want a fair PvP mode where winning a fight is based on more than who had the best gear. Gear should obviously play a part of it, but it should give players a small advantage not a massive one
---
I have an AA Ultracite Laser Rifle that is pretty comparable to a Combat Rifle in VATS (commando) but it breaks in 2-3 magazines. :(
---
It‚Äôs also a day people are working, so I think more mature players will be on tonight.
---
No, there is a YouTube video testing this 
---
Be online in an hour. 
---
Thanks for reporting this, we're investigating!
---
Long since fixed. Now it‚Äôs one at a time. 
---
It has been like this for me since day one ...only time it wasn't was before I joined the brotherhood
---
But reddit told bethesda no existing character. Why didn't they listen to us? WE ARE THE LAW!
---
I definitely agree that 76 is far less story-driven compared to the previous Fallout games.  Hunting around for notes and holotapes has been helping me get immersed in the environment of the game instead. I find the stories left behind to be a bit sad and charming at the same time which is a solid way to describe the tone of the game. Of course this is just what I have observed so far in what little I've played :)
---
Well, you could lost all your suplies that you collected in months, just in 10minutes on this super great beta mode called survival. I actualy get tons of meds from some guy, but complain too, becouse that is fucked up to be scared to play.
---
Are there any upgrades to it or is it like the 50 cal with like one option?
---
Oh great, more overpriced garbage. Neat.
---
I'm not viewing on my phone.
---
I guess I could pick up my monitor and turn it.  But that's too much work to read a picture of notes on a piece of paper :)
---
Except you don't buy today Iphone for 600 dollars and week later the prices drops for 150 dollars.
---
I have no idea how people have full assn/sent gear to use though. I have like 400 hours in the game, and the only thing people will trade that kind of gear for is godly weapons, like BE lever action, BE handmade, etc. I've found 1 good weapon so far (that I use, bloody explosive harpoon gun) and one assn/cav piece I could trade. Unless I go on ebay or have a duper friend, getting the kind of gear that I'd need seems impossible. People don't sell that stuff for caps.
---
Read. The. God. Damned. Roadmap.
---
I love finding built up workshops that were left behind by someone who had it but left the server.  I dont have to build a thing, just take the shop and BOOM, we're in business!
---
That is griefing, plain and simple, and needs to be reported by everyone who sees or experiences it.  
---
What the hell is a freshie going to have  worth killing them for? No junk or aid, no caps. No weapons or armor. And where else can they go? Got to spawn right back there and die all over again.
---
We overuse the word griefing a lot here but ganking vaulties is explicitly an attempt to ruin the fun of another player completely. 
---
If I was higher level with my survival character (I started anew a few days ago to get some Fasnacht stuff), I'd start hanging by the Vault to defend. 
---
Wasn‚Äôt me, but if I had to guess I‚Äôd say it was downvoted because the slap damage removal mechanics have been known for a while.
---
We need people to complain even if it is annoying because without it there wouldn't be changes. Plus the game mode like u said is in BETA so im pretty sure bethesda wants people to complain so they can know what need to be changed.
---
I can see it that way. When private serves come out that's when we will see fun balanced PvP, much like in ark with dedicated servers
---
On Xbox and having the same issue. Layout is a little different too. 
---
[Cargo Bots](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cargobot) 
---
I like using energy weapons but laser and plasma rifles are still too fragile for the damage output they have. Heavy weapon versions, however, are amazing. They properly buffed the durability of them across the board.
---
Honestly I didn't even participate it much.  Probably a total of 6 times tops. I though it was boring as hell and really only wanted he plans, which were kind of underwhelming. 
---
4 days ago i was able to transfer technical data from inventory to stash, today i cant (they dont apper in transfer menu)
---
It may have been too bad that they fixed that bug at momma dolce‚Äôs.  Could have got rid of it in the food processor. 
---
Yeah, in public, for everyone to see, what prevents people from falling for that chorus of lies in this circlejerk of a subreddit. That's time well spent in my book.
---
You're not exactly the audience here. That there's people jumping onto it only shows how big of a nerve me saying it strikes ~
---
shut up todd
---
Woot!?
---
If that‚Äôs the case then why even respond to a post about PvP. Your opinion is irrelevant, you don‚Äôt PvP on fallout, you even said it.
---
thats actually a really good idea
---
This sounds fun, I can‚Äôt wait to rob people for type writers 
---
I never saw why being a bounty hunter loses you caps if you lose. Granted give the wanted something for overcoming. But not as high as it is. 
---
Still no need, regardless of people's opinions
---
maybe you can
---
"If you save the picture to your computer you can easily rotate it clockwise/ccw with the default windows picture viewer."
---
Vats crits man. Assume everyone has sentinals.
---
Yeah I'm probably gonna only do PvP after stashing aid to avoid losing it. I'm more excited for the XP bonus than fighting. I think the cap system will make people more aggressive to lower levels, just because it's less risk to fight them. Important to still treat them as threats though, a level 26 almost killed me yesterday, and I'm level 100 lmao
---
This mode is basically what I‚Äôve been waiting for, it‚Äôs what I was hoping from the start. 
---
But it‚Äôs a weird one, because they‚Äôve decided to allow for unlimited free character migration I‚Äôm not even going to bother.  They‚Äôve made a mode that‚Äôs supposed to be more difficulty yet the fact that you can jump between modes defeats its purpose. Not only that but I‚Äôm not wearing god tier gear so I‚Äôm definitely not stepping into it anytime soon. I suspect I‚Äôm not alone either. 
---
Such a shame, I was looking forward to this so much. 
---
Yep agreed. My alt is heavy weapons and I have a couple 3 stars that absolutely melt.
---
Question 
---
When you die by and ai enemy do you sti drop an aid item or is it only by fellow players?
---
Hey there! It's been reported and worked on. 
---
Put it in a stash. 
---
Not to mention if everyone made 10 camps all those assets that would be added to the game.... the lag.
---
just beat them and take their caps. if youre playing with friends, shouldnt be impossible
---
Not sure about the peforating mags being better.  
---
Doubt based on this:
---
I had 2 sniper rifles, both fully repaired.
---
one hardened, one hardened perforating.  
---
Both 308, identical except one has perf. magazine, one does not.
---
PEr numbeers shown in inventory, the hardened sniper does about 10 more damage than the hardened perforating.
---
People do sell that stuff for caps and I‚Äôve bought full sets of you name it for caps. 
---
The game doesn't have years to be like that. So we talk about months now. The Camo paints where there since release i believe, its been a good 5 months.
---
Its like me, im on my way to finally dropping the cash on a Nintendo Switch, but i know they will drop a different model in the next few months, so do i buy now and play now or wait abit and hopefully get a cooler edition or upgraded system. It all depends on the person, can't blame something like that on the store, but then again people are mentally naive and will always look for a scapegoat. Educate yourself before jumping the gun.
---
Maybe stash your junk and excess aid items before you join survival? 
---
They just need to give an option for fresh and everyone is happy. Let current characters play it how it is designed now, and add a new character slot that is locked to survival only and with other survival only characters. Everybody wins!
---
It is too early to freak out.
---
However there are some issues that will need to be addressed.
---
One shot kills are not fun, spawn camping at train stations, the inclusion of a relatively safe environment in Whitesprings to repair and prepare, etc...
---
Pacifists shouldnt be allowed in survival
---
I have a workshop blueprint with ammo and chemistry setup and some heavy turrets. It‚Äôs two stories and easy to place and keeps NPC attackers occupied enough to assassinate from stealth. I‚Äôve built stages and other things too. I think on PC there are fewer folks using the workshop to force PvP ambushes, but I‚Äôve found that building makes it more expensive to claim the workshop so it can be less profitable to harass someone with a built up workshop. 
---
Same. Nobody could even get time to move. Just *click* *sizzle* *dead*.
---
It has been doing that since like patch 2 or so. 
---
I see, the other day there where a bunch of players in that zone, but no camp. 
---
I was wondering what's going on. 
---
At long last the number of such a beautiful vault is revealed.
---
Marsupial costs 200 caps...
---
I don't think you're having any impact on people's opinions of this game, especially when your comments are being downvoted to the point of being hidden.
---
I have a responser/minutemen based faction 
---
Well, I thought random amount != half of my inventory. And it's not just stimpacks.
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Have a good one üëçüèº
---
Maybe not a week. But yeah they drop
---
the dude you were replying to said today's patch stopped that and that there was no need to do that anymore, I never said whether or not it did but you saying what happened before today is irrelevant to a post about what may or may not have changed today.  so you can show *yourself* out, asshole.
---
Weird. It hasn't worked for any of my teams or anyone I know since the last patch. Glad it seems to be working for you. 
---
Vats in a skill-based PVP game, hehehe. 
---
And yea, the idea that some people have full sentinals and drug stacking and OP legendary weapons is exactly why this will probably just be an imbalanced mess for its tenure.
---
 But what about the players with full inventories and mules? They need validation too. But no really stash it or cash it. 
---
Sounds like what I figured‚Ä¶ everyone that loves to kill and rob others in adventure, doesn't like it so much when it happens to them.
---
No one that I've found man. Are you on console? You can still get that stuff on console for caps, but on PC it's trade only. No one will sell you assn/sent for caps, they want a god tier weapon for just one freaking piece.
---
Except weight reduction perks don‚Äôt work on stash so stashing aid isn‚Äôt exactly an option
---
At the end of the day I don't see my self paying $15 bucks or 1500 Atoms for a paint job. I'll rather wear the ones that the game provides.
---
Gotcha good luck skeleton 
---
With the voice of Liberty Prime!
---
Man, I just hope there's some way to get the recipes/plans, I only got to do it one time and halfway through the server disconnected me.
---
Unless you had a glitched piece of Tech Data (which can occasionally happen, and if done right gives you potential for infinite Tech Datas), picking up tech data always merges into "one" Diamond marked quest item to turn in.  Picking up 1, 2, 3, 10, etc. always showed one.
---
Picking up 1 and turning them in gives you 350 exp + rewards.  Picking up 2 or more and turning them in gives you 400 exp + rewards.  Been like that for like... 3 patches at least.  After one of those patches it actually purged inventories of excess Tech data, dropping them as unlootable items (not in brown bags) by players' CAMP Stashes.
---
Everything changes once you join the Brotherhood and can actually get the quest.  Prior to joining you can collect them in quantities and store them.
---
Do what you want this is the wasteland there is no rules. 
---
Okay, i restarted the game a few times now it works. 
---
Still sad they aren't playable.
---
lol I agree
---
Eh I don't know what you mean by mature. It had nothing to do with maturity. I don't blame the player, they were just doing exactly what Bethesda is letting people do. It's not their fault.
---
on it
---
Be honest... you don't like being the victim of a one-shot kill. But I'd bet a nuka cola that  you love it when you do it to someone else.
---
Perhaps May will be our time to shine! Purveyor seems like a great solution to pure RNG 
---
The wanted player gets the junk from the loser. That's enough.
---
Besides, y'know, giving someone something for winning a fight while wanted is like giving a kid a chocolate treat while he's in time out for fighting in class.
---
Doesn't make sense to me.
---
I collected at least 3 copies of all the plans/recipes that I could. One was for my main character, one for my alt character and one for my friend who didn't do the event.
---
The masks I only collected for myself and my friend since they're pretty fugly.
---
I'm not worried about anyone I just want the bounty system to work and be fun. If people see the bounty system as a way to further enrich your killer they won't use it.  And I don't doubt that they are indifferent about caps, but I am sure they do like taking as many caps off their victims as possible. 
---
I wonder if It will be opened in summer with the High Level Vault Raid or It will be involved in the Shear Terror quest ü§î
---
&gt; that's too much work to read a picture of notes on a piece of paper :)
---
Literally all it would do is delay the "god builds wrecking my shit" posts for like 2 weeks at best.
---
It‚Äôs okay so far, I started a new character and it‚Äôs already made me team up with a stranger which I‚Äôve only ever done a couple times in adventure mode. Already been one-shot 2 or 3 times by high level players though so maybe the balance needs to be tweaked slightly IMO
---
Just go kill some people and take their stempacks.
---
Don't attack someone standing still.  Wait til they move.  Or cryo grenade them first or something lol.  
---
I'm sure they tried tweaking things, but yea, I wasn't impressed at all. I PVPed for years across multiple games and I've never seen anything as bad as launch day one-shots, haha.
---
Basically the game was created and balanced around PVE, and now they're unleashing that on a PVP mode. I doubt it will end well. 
---
&gt;OMG IM LOOSING AID THIS IS BROKEN
---
I'm not saying that. I'm saying losing \~80% of your inventory after who deaths seems a bit too much.
---
Level 10 near the Cranberry bog. Jeez. I've gotten a few 3*s lately and one was level 45 on my level 32 alt. 
---
 I helped a random out with the BOS end quest on my level 199 and we killed a 3* mirelurk king. We each got 2 low level 1* armor pieces.
---
What happens when you run out of caps due to being killed repeatedly?  Do you get a not-enough-caps PVP debuff?
---
Yeah survival absolutely needs to be a seperate character.  And you should drop your whole kit on death, but just aid.  There's no motivation to go after anyone.  High level characters will have no reason to be there because their level advantage is scaled off, new players won't find much extra reward if nothing particularly useful drops from player kills, and people playing adventure mode won't be happy because they're not getting the extra EXP bonus for playing survival.  They shouldn't "punish" adventure players for not doing PvP by giving them less EXP.  The reward should be in the risk/reward of the pvp drop mechanics instead of making minmaxing adventure players be forced to play survival for the EXP bonus.  
---
Nah, the meta was already shifted to damage resist and mitigation, it's why there are so many so called "immortal" builds.  However, this does change how much more defensive those builds are, causing PVP encounters to be a bit more drawn out than before.
---
Huh. I carry a Furious 1\* Gauss and a TSE Lever, the Gauss definitely is more powerful in my instance. Both are maxed on mods. 
---
&gt;Lost 200 caps, 20 stimpacks, 20 nuka cola quantums and bunch of other stuff. All on one death. Bethesda have you ever played a pvp game? Doesn't seem like it
---
Right? You should have lost your entire inventory like most pvp survival games, not just some easily replaceable caps, junk, and aid items.
---
I‚Äôm in the U.K. and I‚Äôm playing. 
---
I know I have nothing on this but, 51 immediately made me think of aliens...
---
&gt; Most if not all players that I came across were basically going around with their TSE, BE or sentinel/assassins builds one shotting people.
---
So if you made people roll a new character, what will you do in 4 weeks when everyone has all that gear from farming?
---
The problem isn't people having good gear. The problem is there needs to be a big balance pass on gear. Some gear is too good, some is too bad.
---
Give us another character slot for a locked survival only character, that is matched with other survival only characters. (someone mentioned this in another post)
---
They can keep the current design so that current characters can do survival, but let people opt in to a new survival only pool of characters that is untainted by duping, launch bugs, XP exploits, and anything else that the current characters have been exposed to.
---
The game is completely different if you had to go through survival mode while questing, leveling, and farming every item you have. Value of items goes way up, and integrity of the game experience is greatly increased.
---
Sure it does. I logged in last night and immediately got a team invite. Ignored it, and a minute later got an XBL msg saying "I'm logging out. Team up and have my workshops." I used them for an hour or so and then bounced when someone contested one of them.
---
Yep. It said it would greatly reduce the likelihood of one shot kills, not eliminate them. Epic builds are still epic builds. 
---
They literally put out the same amount of firepower for the sloth as the SBQ. 
---
Wouldn't mind a more RPG element to it honestly. 
---
If you're a mutant RadShield is the best thing when you discover it. With green thumb, chemist and super duper a single harvest will net you enough to last and share with teammates. Wish I'd known about the other two early on!
---
&gt;You drop a huge amount of Aids like crazy
---
Condoms man, gotta use em
---
Right, they're attempting to limit how much it happens. I don't see where it says "remove entirely".
---
why even have pacifist as an option in survival?
---
They said you would lose a portion of aid items (I am guessing you had a LOT on you). With fast travel spots limited, and a challenge to kill legendary enemies, Whitespring station is going to be camped. You can't play it like adventure.
---
Gun perks and rifle perks are one in the same. And every other weapon benefits from those perks too. 
---
I too like to submit responses with no thought put in, but I am usually belligerent drunk when I do.
---
ooohh....way better than the 11 damage per shot last time I had an LMG.
---
Might have to look for another :)
---
Is the amount you drop fixed or percentage based? 
---
Never will. It‚Äôs not like the people want 100% rework just make it a challenge to get one shot. 
---
No, he‚Äôs pissed off because Bethesda can‚Äôt balance this game right. Losing a couple stimpacks or Nuka colas is ok, losing 40 of the best healing items in the game is not.
---
Upvoted for relevance lol. I didn't even think about the excavator armor
---
some caps and aid items is childs play, they could have made it so we lose everything like most survival games.
---
Still holding out for a one time respec.  My 4 stack will not return until then and while I understand why Beth and many players feel it's unnecessary this is the threshold for my group.  Let the downvotes begin...
---
Better solution. Don't give the owner's name out. Done
---
hell, don't even show it as owned on the map. You only find out when you visit it. 
---
Done. Problem solved.
---
Came here to say this one of the reasons for putting a program in beta is to collect complaints as well as compliments which will be used to make changes.
---
If anything I'd say now during the beta immediately after launch is the perfect and ultimate time to complain. 
---
Me too! Feels bad
---
offer?
---
I did the same. Thankfully they fixed it for me.
---
So not sure if this will help but ever since patch 7 I was able to put stuff down that I wasn't able to before, I just had to select or move it and look at the ground right in front of my character and usually the item would turn green.  Like putting down foundations in spots that never let me before which worked out to my advantage to seal in my camp in spots I couldn't before.  IT also would partially bury some crops but allow me to plant them.
---
Did the same for some industrial water purifiers....they are in the water about 2/3 which is awesome since I'm on a river and they were obstructing my scenic views.  :)  
---
Sounds like boredom lol
---
How does it make it longer? But I mean I think I do decent damage so I'm not gonna be a burden really lol
---
I can make you some :)
---
Where did I say remove. I said ‚Äúnot an issue‚Äù I was being vague as it as yet to be seen what the change has affected. 
---
I‚Äôm speaking from personal experience buddy and it happens a lot to me and like you said, you don‚Äôt seek out PvP that often, so you‚Äôre not the best source for the frequency in which this occurs. Hope I see you in survival mode tho!
---
Didn't realise just how much people carried around! 
---
Boi where you buying an SKS at?
---
i bet you want half of little Johnny's sandwich too, you red bastard
---
I think people will spam Vats to try and target incoming players to get a jump on them. 
---
I see, thanks for the reply and good luck!
---
i feel the loading in immortality should be 15 full seconds, or until you fire your weapon
---
That the new legendary shop?
---
Hey, stay out of my pockets!
---
I choose the other option, not participating in a PVP mode pasted onto a PVE mode with minimal balancing. xD  
---
I like my PVP skill-based, not gear-based!
---
A communist joke isn‚Äôt funny until everyone gets it
---
Yes !!!!
---
Irrelevant and wrong. Survial is extremely satisfying for PvP oriented people and they'll just switch there. Twenty times the fun.
---
I'd actually love to play a mode with full loot drop and only craftable gear, but your argument that PvP is completely imbalanced comes from spending little time actually researching it, having a bad build and being envious for gear people worked hard for, justifying your anger by self-righteous anger against the game economy.
---
The atom shop doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äúreasonably priced‚Äù
---
This mode is for us. I dont get you? Do you want to just ban good weapons so that a year from now everyone has pipe rifles still?   We want to use our fallout gear in end-game PvP and survival. Seriously.  There are plenty of games for more realisim or more balanced arena style play.  Why not just play adventure mode until you're ready?  Server hop at Wes tell all weekend like I did. Lol
---
Too bad you can‚Äôt get anti armor and instigating in the same gun.
---
Lights back on, spotlight on you.
---
Out of all of the changes, leaderboards confuse me the most. It's not a testament of skill what so ever. In a game that caters to builds that can one shot you, why would we want a leaderboard to give these players even more of an ego boost. 
---
I'm hoping next weeks in the vault will be Bethesda's addressing chnages to make PvP more enjoyable for those who can't sit and play a game for 20 hours to attain the necessary gear to be visible. 
---
Better red than dead ftfy
---
The Fasnacht Parade balloon camp items had missing textures that have been fixes too.
---
6.5 lbs. that‚Äôs a stock wasr-10 (civilian ak)
---
8.5 lbs. that‚Äôs an m16a4.
---
that was what I was thinking lol
---
Make the items/containers glow: Mods already do this today....
---
I do believe the more players that are present, the more HP she gets
---
Don‚Äôt forget tse was nerfed not much but still nerfed. My instigating lever drops supers easy. Gauss even with anti armour doesn‚Äôt even with full charge. 
---
They don't supress mutations and boost RR?
---
Oh I read it, I just wonder what good sneek is on the survival server, if sneaking still has you displaying on the map? What good is my 15 agility/perception if everybody can still see me?
---
The game still gives them to the person who killed you. 
---
This is a great suggestion
---
There are a whole bunch of perks and mutations that really only work if you're part of a team, so if none of my IRL friends are playing I'll send invites to people. Even if we both continue doing our own thing, at least I'm benefiting from the +2 SPECIAL bonus from herd mentality, the +15% XP bonus from Inspirational, etc.
---
IIRC, my instigating weapon description says  double damage on the first hit if enemy is at ful health, sodepending on the base damage rate, ya, I can see a 1 hit kill.
---
What is supposed to happen to one's stuff in a hardcore survival mode? You ‚Ä¶ were killed. The killer... looted your body. I thought this is EXACTLY the logic that all those "raiders" were using to justify being dicks in adventure mode, no?
---
No I just want to own noobs with my Explosive shotgun
---
At least nothing would be duped
---
Those are different enemies with different health pools.  I can tell you my gauss can kill a robot in Watoga with a no charge or a charged shot, but higher health guys like assaultrons or gutsys definitely show a major difference.
---
Bought them from Grahm. Not the easiest vendor to find but you never know.
---
Most TSE weapons and the other best gear is duped. Bringing duped items from Adventure to Survival can affect the game balance on Day 1. It was a huge oversight on Beth's part.
---
Interesting. I'll try this when I get home.
---
Same! I always spent a little extra time getting that bees wax. But not being a science person, does it even make sense that bees wax scraps to acid?
---
Yeah, you gotta wonder how a level 10 newb would get over to that side of the map. Let alone be able to down several high level enemies to even get to the legendary but it was pretty comical non the less! 
---
I wonder if the thing they changed had something to do with your characters level. Maybe higher chances if you're lower level. 
---
You did well to get a few. I must have played about 5 hours a day on average. I dropped nukes I visited places all over the map. I think I found only 2 3* pieces both have pretty poor stats. As I say though hopefully things are on the up and people can stop complaining about people with nice weapons (because they can find them themselves) and higher levels will be able to get back to dropping nukes and grinding for gear to sell or trade with others to get the things they are missing. 
---
You have been awarded 100 troll points
---
So, kill him back. Take his shit. isn't that the entire point of this?
---
Then play that type of game.  Role playing games with experience and levels use those mechanics to  demonstrate your characters skills not your own.  I served 13 years in the military, and it does not help me at all when I make a new dungeons and dragons character.  Skill is for baseball and fortnite.  Lol
---
So if I have 0 caps, and I get killed, they still get caps?  Seems unintended.
---
The full roadmap looks like a attempt to finish this unfinished game to me though. That's far from "adding things" imo, means that the upcomming year is gonna be spent in actually finishing the base game that should've been released in this state allready with no significant changes done to the more then lacking pve.
---
Update: I was standing next to Murgle the Cat to get a picture when he just...fell over dead...
---
I'm bummed I didn't get the balloons decoration for my camp. That's all I wanted.
---
oh i see, in that case the magazine and the bobblehead perks need that too
---
Hell yeah mate me too! High five!
---
Oh really? I didnt think enemies scaled like that but makes sense
---
Don‚Äôt bring a mule to pvp mode? 
---
They won‚Äôt be shown anywhere unless they are in your perception range. When they are in your perception range(size of which based on your perception) they will show as a red dot on your compass. 
---
And no you can still easily be 1 shotted.
---
K
---
thanks. gonna convert these to V bucks
---
I hope they make an arena type area for people.wanting PvP. Something better thought out than Hunter/Hunted.
---
No, PC
---
No. 
---
I bought it th he first day. 
---
Sprinkles in picture, sprinkles in game. 
---
I guess people can level your base if you are on the leaderboard?
---
It is time to build on top of a mountain.
---
Sentinel: reduce damage by 15% when standing still (not crouched)
---
Cavalier: reduce by 15% when sprinting.
---
assassins: 8% dmg reduction from players.
---
Max reduction is 95% iirc. 
---
For actual builds, bloody, vats sniper, and Hudenburgs (exploding shotguns flying around everywhere) seems to be the current meta. 
---
Each has its strengths and weakness. Gamma guns hurt all of em prettt badly. Theyre tough to protect against.
---
Stash broken?
---
So do you need 500 lead, or 500 bulked lead? Either way I‚Äôve got you. What‚Äôre you reading for it?
---
sorry, no clue if 1K is reasonable, let me know what you think would be a reasonable offer
---
Gotcha. The way that was worded I wasn‚Äôt sure. In that case yeah, I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs a mistake and customer support can at least refund you. 
---
üò¥üò¥üò¥
---
 I would love to see an unforgiving survival game where you drop everything in your inventory upon death. However, the PvP is super unbalanced. Removing lengendaries from survival mode would completely even the playing field and make it easier to change the game to drop all items which would be a nice addition. 
---
I stopped playing because i launched a nuke solo on day 3 and bought jet pack from vendor and sat in dirty puddle for all the mutations.
---
Everything else was mediocre at best.  If meeting cool people is a highlight, it has nothing to do with the game.
---
Please do not cover up bad situations with ‚Äòi met cool people‚Äô.
---
I‚Äôll be on this evening sometime around 5 PM PST. I can meet you somewhere if I can figure out how to do that.
---
Same! I know this new mode will encourage people to reanalyze how the build/design CAMPS.  I want that Fallout Doomsday Bunker, but I want to keep my trading post too. 
---
One could argue that you can just switch characters but if you have a lot invested into one it's not easy to start anew. Espicially a fresh start on survival where everyone and their grandma has perfected their PvP builds 
---
I dont think its broken. You get less caps for killing someone than the other person loses, so the return for trying to abuse the system is very low. That, mixed with the risk of losing caps by dying to the other person, means the situation you mentioned isnt going to be super common or game breaking. I agree that its a mild issue, but revamping the whole system wouldnt be worth it in my opinion
---
If you bought the old skins‚Äîlike me‚Äîall you get is new PA camo plus shotgun camo. 
---
Definitely try. Also try placing something elsewhere and then moving it to where you want. The bad part is when you're looking straight down sometimes it's a little hard to get in the right spot but like I said it does seem to work slightly better.
---
Who knows with these mutant bees lol. I‚Äôm pretty sure bees have wax glands that secrete the wax so I‚Äôm not sure where acid would come into play. Makes great bullets and lemonade though lol. 
---
My thought exactly. It‚Äôs Adventure Time!
---
Obvious cash grab tie-in with Bohemian Rhapsody.
---
you've received 0.03 V bucks
---
Its not hoarding if you'll use it.... eventually
---
Ughh I started at level 15 and got chased twice by maniacs with either explosive weapons or melee I understand the survival type but at that rate is more of a overpowered tag not fun sorry :/ 
---
In the Whitesprings Bunker, the Enclave Production vendor has the Advanced Power Connectors plan. That‚Äôs where I got mine
---
What if you went to WS and hid by some bots, they might be more cautious to spray bullets at you! ;)
---
I know you can find one of the masks at the brother hood base, I found of for the ‚Äúfasnacht man‚Äù there just lying on the floor
---
I was just saying this to my husband! So I could build a high rise. 
---
I should be on around that time, tho I have no idea how you meet someone on a server
---
DOTA has experience and levels and gear, as do most MMOs including WoW. That doesn't mean any of them trump skill.  :-p  RPG and PVP are not mutually exclusive, and skill should always, ALWAYS be the most significant part of any PVP game/mode. Not necessarily in every single circumstance, as obviously a level 100 should be killing a level 1, but when you're close in level and the fight is as laughably imbalanced as this one was... welp, it's not going to help them get beta testers, I can tell you that much. :-p
---
We'll see if this is a common experience or not though. It could have just been my own.
---
I think that's about it.
---
"Throw sand out of your vag around"
---
That's my new favorite sentence. I like you.
---
dont forget to stack it with sleeping and cranberry cobblers.
---
Noooooope that will get bombarded often. As will mine cause I'm setting up a trading post at Harper's Ferry
---
üòÇ
---
Is the caps you lose same as your level number, i.e. 100 caps for a level-100 player?
---
I don't want stealth and murder in Hitman.
---
Indeed.  Once you start relying on things like Traveling Pharmacy, you forget just how heavy Stimpacks actually are.
---
To me, having the loss be a random amount out of your total seems a bit excessive, versus some fixed value.
---
You can also use r/market76 . That's where most people get their top tier stuff
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are walking around with so many aid items in survival. It says you lose a percentage. The more you carry the more you lose. 
---
Just wait. Juicehead will make a video. Wonder which side will get him views.
---
I am hoping the patch will fix it for me.  I have already restarted a few times.
---
Programming would probably be very easy, but there is a LOT of traffic provided by voice / audio over IP
---
On their current infrastructure that would provide an immense additional load and probably provide much higher latency as a result
---
Not trying to troll, but what's with Charleston Station? I  can't think of anything there off the top of my head,  but I've also not ever built there, or spent much time aside from the vendor there.
---
Ive played some MMO-RPG games when people met in game them got a long distant relationship, then married. But that is rare.Like really rare.
---
same goes for the enemy player seen as a red dot on the radar. i cannot believe it. 
---
That's really sad. I was saving up for them and decided to buy serums instead. It would definitely be neat to be able program them to blink or turn on at different intervals along with color changes.
---
The issue is that there‚Äôs no challenge to it. If it was a struggle to stay fed and hydrated, it would add a new dimension to gameplay. As it is now, all it means is that you have to open your pip boy and click two things every few minutes. 
---
You can‚Äôt the robots didn‚Äôt take player damage.
---
I think if you add someone as a friend you can jump to their server. My ign is roundyroundy (no underscore).
---
I'm guessing you can't, but for balance reasons Bethesda may have excluded aid from this. I didn't have any in my stash before hand, next time I get on I'll double check.
---
I feel like it would be more fun if you lost less caps or an equal amount between players. This whole loosing caps equal to my lvl is a huge turn off.
---
Not aware of this issue, I've been played game in months... thanks for the heads up!
---
sweet.
---
And people wonder why they made it a separate mode
---
Yeah I can do that. I can be on any time this afternoon (PST) 
---
U: Cyborgarchon
---
That is not what he said. He said the patch before today‚Äôs patch. Jesus can you even read? No one cares what you have to say, your messages have been a waste of time simply because you can‚Äôt read. Find someone else to bother.
---
Hate you...been trying to finish that quest FOREVER......have killed one of the 10
---
Why not do one of each?
---
This is how every multiplayer survival game works though the way Fo76 goes about it is different
---
you must be reading a different post. I didn't see that anywhere.
---
All dupes were purged
---
&gt; There can't be THAT many people buying the game new and purchasing Atoms.
---
You would be wrong about that
---
Disabling legendary weapons effects will cause riots. If anything they should be halted in survival. Make the ya know survival aspects mean something and not who spent more caps. 
---
Start a new character!
---
A huge inconvenience long-term and short-term isnt worth it in my opinion for a short-term solution
---
Depends on what the top post on reddit is whike he is recording. 
---
*finishes 7th bottle of nukashine*
---
Oh really? I don‚Äôt think so
---
Heck off, it‚Äôs common sense to look into one shot builds/damage before putting a PvP mode out there. Everyone is just camping train stations with AAE, BE and so on weapons
---
I get home around 6 EST, my ign is ascott38 I'm also on the fallout network discord @Not Alex
---
This exactly.  The market place was flooded with the best weapons and best gear from dupers for a handful of caps Each because they had so many.
---
 I've been a very outspoken on the dumb a** decision to not lock characters into their specific modes meaning you have to start a new character if you want to place a survival.
---
 I really wanted to play survival until I found out characters could just switch back-and-forth between modes. It blows my mind That some Jack a** thought this would be a good idea.
---
For now anyway......
---
This was my idea to fix workshops
---
Upon activating a workshop you get 3 options. First is single claim.
---
Single claim is a workshop and you setup. You pay a smaller and flatter cap few.You do all the building and maintaining it. Another player let‚Äôs call them Nora can go up to the workshop bench and request to join the place putting up a cap fee. As the owner you can chose to let them in or deny them. If Nora is accepted she can build and collect resources.
---
Option two: multi claim.
---
Multi claim allows you to claim the location as a team. Paying a larger cap fee. The team is James, Nate, Nora and Kellogg. Each of you is equal to the workshop. All can build, collect and destroy items at will. Same rules as before. How ever each one of you can be killed and lose the place.
---
Raiding is an option where here let‚Äôs say Preston wanted the location but didn‚Äôt get there in time. Instead of requesting to join Preston can engage pvp with you only as you as the only one in single claim. If you die Preston gets the location no cap cost. One on on pvp.
---
If Preston has a team and goes to the above teams location both teams engage in pvp and the winning team gets the location. It‚Äôs a one life battle.
---
As extra flavour any time you or member of your workshop makes caps from events or quests a small amount will be sent to all claimed locations to help with building defense bots and repairs to the location in question.
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate people buying cosmetics from a shop . Bet they make bank of it 
---
Well, yeah ofc drop. It would been understandable if that bundle was discounted like they normally do. Like the current Camo PA, that has been in store since release, what is currently 30% off. That makes totally sense, but not the bundle that is worth close to 7000 caps being sold for 1500 caps and in that bundle is totally new skin.
---
&gt; Wanted to try survival and lost 90% of my stuff at least 200 aid items, cool.
---
Something, something, stashbox
---
Add how unbalanced it is 
---
Listen, if Fallout 76 was a 'decent game' then I wouldnt be making this post to begin with, would I?
---
Also, if I were to come out of my bunker to an actually good Fallout 76, then that would be great. But judging by what Bethesda (I'm going to refer to them as "fuckwits" from now on) has done, (banning people, making them write essays, releasing an unfinished game) I don't think Fallout 76 will ever be good.
---
Okay, I'll add you when I get on. Thank you so much
---
Rad shield 300 bitch to make though 
---
Glowing fungus soup 20 rr easy to make 
---
Glowing blood pack 75 easy to make 
---
No negatives at all. Think they are ten mins while soup is 60
---
There's a glitch in the Wendigo cave that every time I face the progenitor wendigo, the game freezes and crashes. Not the world/server, but the whole game. 
---
You could lose your entire inventory like all other survival games.
---
This is a "beta". Maybe their using this as a test to work out the horrible problems in PvP now to be able to implement something like that later.
---
Then again...
---
This is what I'm thinking the backpack will be for, at least I hope so. I do keep a small garage blueprint with crafting stations, stashbox, etc. to plunk down at workshops. The beauty of that being it uses the shop's components instead of mine.
---
You just made his point for him. 
---
You are supposed to lose a percentage, people are reportedly losing nearly, if not, all of their aid items. 
---
I keep telling friends that complain about having problems when taking workshops, "Stop taking workshops if you're not built for PVP."
---
At this point in the game, taking workshops simply isn't an effective way to gather resources. 
---
I find if you exit the game through the menu versus closing the application, that it‚Äôs much more likely to work, as by doing this you are leaving the server and then team, versus closing the application you are just leaving the server and not the team, which probably confuses the server.
---
Oooh sick roast I don't know how I'm going to recover from that one
---
‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a use for prewar money‚Äù
---
Well, that‚Äôs a complicated question that governments have been dealing with for several hundred years now. When your currency isn‚Äôt intrinsically valuable and made of valuable metals, how do you force it to be worth something? Once the banks fell, it just became paper. Make a silly hat out of it and see if someone will buy it is my advice. 
---
Lol! Funny thing is you only see it if you pick the Wild Wasteland perk in the beginning, and I picked it for my first playthrough and thought the geckos were a part of it because of how ridiculous they looked running at me
---
Almost like EWOing in gta online, lol. 
---
Even if you're not hunting people down, you'll eventually be Longest Lived and your location/camp will be broadcasted for the tryhards to go kill.
---
Best advice is to stay off Survival unless you are okay with being shot at, ha
---
Ew. Now that's a nasty exploit. I hope they're working on correcting that ASAP. Until then, I'm even more committed to not touching the workshops. :-/
---
It‚Äôs funny cos last night I was given the option to place a red enamel stove but wouldn‚Äôt let me cos I hadn‚Äôt purchased it. I just brushed it off assuming it was another one of many things I couldn‚Äôt afford in the atom store lol
---
I can tell you FO76 is a money making machine as long as they produce more items to buy in the Atom shop.  They would never divulge the analytics of it as they have nothing to gain from it, but you better believe it.
---
What are you even talking about lol. It's a deathclaw gauntlet with bloodied and increased power attack, that's among the best possible combos for a weapon, and 200 baseline damage is quite high compared to other weapons (DCG seems to have a bonus).
---
You'd better be providing some evidence if you want me to believe that 200 damage is 'low'. xD
---
Yeah and you get metal and leather camo skins too, don‚Äôt those are in the shop ?
---
&gt; Add how unbalanced it is
---
Adventure mode is unbalanced survival just inherited. 
---
Just the person taking the workshop and any teammates they have.
---
The real kicker?
---
If they have teammates, you can't hurt *them* unless you engage *them* in PVP but since they are on the team of the player taking the workshop, they can hurt *you* without you needing to agree to PVP.
---
The entire workshop mechanic is broken and exploitable.  All they need to do is limit workshop PVP to the build area and/or give the owner the option to defend of give up the workshop peacefully.
---
Time to bring out the popcorn üëç
---
True, more views 
---
Yep!
---
I was first on my server in almost all the leaderboards for a while because my CAMP has a very visible stairs structure, but the actual camp is in the  cave. Once I was in the top 3 I just kept murdering anyone foolish enough to go through my lag-inducing bone chime tunnel. My acid cave is now a salt mine when players with a mic wonder in to claim the title.
---
Thinking this is a skill-based PVP game, hehehe...
---
It's not just VATS, it's the mutations and legendary weapons and armor, too. They're all so "elite." 
---
plan is still a good idea since that way if you ever get a good legendary one you can use super duper, make a shit ton of low level ones and scrap it for mods
---
No, I didn‚Äôt. You shouldn‚Äôt be walking around in survival with over 200 aid items. 
---
Awesome thanks!
---
That would help but you would still have people camping the spawn area.
---
I had 15 addictol before these challenges started; now I have none.
---
Make a new character and transfer over some from your main character by finding a guy on the server that you can‚Äôt transfer worlds to and drop those items In a box then go back using that guys name and pick them up with the new character.
---
My bloodied power fist sits at about 2k damage when I'm at 20% health (which is always, thanks to rads).  I'm only wearing a few parts of unyeielding gear too. So mines not even the best it could be.  
---
How about the philanthropist tailor who has a stall near the Overseer's camp and hands out full sets of level 5 deep-pocketed leather armor? I love that guy!
---
‚ÄúOh look so and so has 999 hours survived. He must be awesome!‚Äù
---
He‚Äôs crouched under a rock in some forgotten map corner, not even playing the game, just letting the counter go up while he watches tv. 
---
You‚Äôre likely just salty you don‚Äôt have 1 friend good enough to help you transfer to your mule, how sad.
---
Me and my gf just tried survival died about 10 times each and now have nothing left for aid items...
---
We would be on a level playing field first time in the mode. 
---
After that others will grind more than you and get better drops than you and have teams to events and pvp better/faster than you.
---
Uh power armor is like paper in pvp
---
Counter point: Giving people hard numbers opens them up for more headache due to people having only a vague grasp of probability. To the average joe, a 1 in 100 chance of a certain drop means that if they do the event 100 times the item WILL drop. In reality though, every time you run the event, you have the same 1 in 100 chances. It doesn't matter how many times you do the event. You always have a 1 in 100 chance. 
---
No offence, but isn't that EXACTLY what rare is?
---
Explosive = plus 20% damage, most folks have fireproof 3 , explosive = meh.  Plus 50% when attacking limbs means . 
---
Gun does 100dmg, shoot leg is 150 damage, I have a .50 cal just like that. AA , +50 limb damage. I aim at knees and thighs . Kills as fast as my tse did back in December almost
---
If you could just swap modes to remove your bounty that wouldn‚Äôt make much sense would it?
---
no mentats can see my 50 Agility full stealth armor baby :D
---
Gotta love a good ol' fashioned 0,0 bug! 
---
Fallout has never been a game for people to grind through as fast as possible. The "endgame" content is exploring the world, and taking on the environmental storytellling. Or roleplaying, giving yourself restrictions or filling a role. There's never been a big user payoff for completion. That isn't Fallout. Anyone who expected otherwise came up with that from their imagination. 76 is certainly flawed, but the opinions of people who don't play the game seems like a pretty useless metric. 
---
is its better to wait for tomorrow and save 500 atoms? what about the leather armor, thats new
---
Can't have ts and vamp together - maybe its Vamp Expl..? If yes, I'd love to buy/trade...
---
Ah, so I predicted the strategy. Wonderful.
---
I server-hopped about 15 times. No luck.
---
But‚Ä¶ it's a ‚Ä¶ survival game?
---
I am super confused by this post. It makes... no sense.
---
Thank you ! Summed up pretty good my feelings too !
---
It has not been fixed, unfortunately. :\\
---
Let's hope it gets fixed before Player Vending.
---
I don't think you understood my position at all. My point is not that gear/levels in the current Survival mode iteration are less important than skill... my point is that they SHOULD BE if Bethesda wants the game to be balanced and to reward effort and skill rather than grind, which tends to make for much more fun PVP. And since this is a beta, all opinions for growth are viable, so 'go play another game if you don't like it' is a stupid response. 
---
And if you think gear trumps skill in most MMOs you've played, you're either playing different MMOs than I have or you're not very skilled. I have destroyed many, many players who had better gear than me in DOTA and WoW, and that's how it should be. Otherwise you might as well call the game 'Lottery PVP' and call it a day. ;-)
---
If you want a separate camp use a separate character.
---
Its either separate or its not. bethesda went with its not.
---
So I alt f4'd out of the game last night because when I died (which is fine, i die a lot, lol) the ONLY place I could re spawn was Whitesprings and since I accidentally hit a guard with a shotgun blast, ofc I am going to just die 100 times and scream. I thought this bug was GONE from the game. It made it literally unplayable last night so I rage quit.
---
SO I guess the bug is back? or am I just the lucky one?
---
Well lvl 45 or  50 legendaries spawn  on enemies that are that level or above, so i do my runs at whitesprings, west tec, harpers ferry. Watoga .. Ofc when a low level player is in that area you might encounter lower lvl enemies. Try to go to one of these places, where no one is around 
---
I have like 3 I'll be on at 8 PM est
---
Awesome. What‚Äôs your ign? You can PM if you don‚Äôt want to post it but I want to make sure I give it to the right person üòõ
---
It Absolutely should be the top 3 players with the most kills. Theyll have the most caps, most aid and junk, and be the most challenging to go against. 
---
The longest to survive could have nothing on them, and zero kills, just got lucky. 
---
Lol but what other way can you get it? That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. 
---
Oh right I should know 90% is going to be lost on death the first day survival comes out.
---
&gt; Don't making angry at me
---
Ah man, I'll try but... oh... shit I'm making angry. 
---
Server hopping as a mechanic at all was a terrible idea
---
How many Aid items did you guys start with?
---
JacktheFlying, same as my Reddit
---
That's what fasnacht was for. Now it's back to chorin.
---
You can‚Äôt one-shot someone with caps though
---
It was a shit show In paper sounds wonderful but everyone is sneaking and killing even a level 15 !!! Tse , sledges and claws in the 3 hours I had all of those chasing me around obviously i was emptied handed lol 
---
Well, THIS wasn't the most junior high response I've seen all day, for sure!
---
Seriously... does your teacher know you're online and not paying attention?
---
Am I reading it right that player positions are hidden on the map except for the top three on the scoreboard? That totally sucks for them! How can they have fun in the world too when they are marked targets?
---
This has always been a reward from this event, just got lucky this time. 
---
Survival mode? More like butthurt mode...
---
You are correct that I didn't specialize as a PvP build.  I shouldn't have to in order to be able to kill someone...Especially if I get the jump on them.  The fact that someone who maxed out rifleman, and tank killer, and covert ops, and is firing from cover getting sneak headshots....only deals 1-2% damage per shot because of a full sentinal build or something similar....is ridiculous.  
---
No, I dont have personal experience in it.  I prefer to avoid PvP, mostly BECAUSE of the balance issues.   But that's my idea to fix a lot of them.  Get rid of the legendary effects and make it more related to skill and build than it is to lucky drops (or outright purchased ones)
---
Nice thanks for the info OP!
---
Yeah I know look at edit
---
Stop saying DotA when we are discussing MMOs.  That's a moba.  Anyway, have you attempted to bring shit gear into open world PvP such as elder scrolls online cyrodiil? 
---
You‚Äôre right‚Äîthey either added leather or metal.  
---
Yeah, I really want to love the camp system, because building camps was about all I did in FO4, but it has so many buggy quirks and pointless limitations (requiring stairs for second story floors, inconsistent and pointless inability to clip through world objects like rocks, not letting things "float", the crazy limitations to where you can and can't put down foundations, the super annoying "Snapping" system, on and on) that at then end I find myself extremely frustrated, with just an -ok- feeling about how it turned out.
---
that Cheese Haus is AMAZING. I feel I know it by heart now lol
---
Could be. We all just quit when we bluescreen or get kicked, so maybe that's it. Thanks for the tip. Strange it just started happening after last patch, though. Once again, sorry for my confusion. 
---
I have so many hornwright keys ... it hurts me to scroll through all of them. No joke i i prob have 80 of ea...it brings me great sadness
---
Lol 
---
I mean, IRL eventually you overcome the withdrawal of an addiction, and the negative effects subside, just like any other disease.
---
&gt; needle or something like that 
---
lol, you forgot what it was called in your haste to post on reddit about it? It's Nailer, and its always been in the game
---
That's basically what I meant.  Dont get rid of them in adventure, and dont destroy the items or anything.  But do "Disable" the legendary effects in survival mode.
---
This sounds good because I have none
---
I was level 2 I had just spawned and ran to the farm
---
Ah dang, well some people over at r/market76 would probably sell you one
---
Thanks guys...you've honestly made me feel better about it!! I just never do microtransactions so I never really know what they're worth I suppose!
---
Another thing this has made me realize is that bone chimes alert all your turrets in a pretty big radius. With 3 shotguns, 3 heavy lasers, and 3 missile turrets tastefully sticking halfway out of the rocks in my cave, there have been a few guys I didn't even get a hit on before they died.
---
Dunno what platform youre on but on xbox i had to manually find the update rather than the usual pop up and update option... if that makes sense...
---
Yes I am aware of how people level up. All starting in the mode for the first time is not starting off on an even playing field. It just is not in anyway. 
---
The only reason it isn't level is the amount of duped TSE/BE weapons and ass/sent armor. Otherwise you're taking hours of gameplay in one mode and applying it to the other, which anyone can do. There's no obligation to join survival before you feel ready to do so.
---
I'm waiting to see how damage was modified for pvp, and how it handles against assassin/sentinel gear, but even so... If someone's harassing you or otherwise a problem, change servers. That's not the best solution possible and it's really not great gameplay but it's an option when Bethesda hasn't implemented any other form of matchmaking.
---
My take on their plan for survival isn't that it's a battle Royale, but the same as regular fo76 except no need to slap anyone to initiate combat. There are certainly going to be griefers but I'm hoping that won't be the majority of players. Hell, it's not like griefers can track you down on the map, generally speaking. 
---
It's called "survival" mode. Besides the obvious of people should be stashing shit, why the hell would they make a mode where you can carry hundreds of stimpacks at once. It should have been a limited inventory from the beginning imo. 
---
- Invisible
---
My god. Learn to play game
---
Once more in english
---
I thought it was just my playstation.
---
i think you missed my point. Raiders wrecking your camp and trying to fight IS an intended aspect of the game. Pacifist mode was simply there to placate the people who were too set in the single player aspect of Fallout's previous iterations. PVP is not griefing, wrecking your camp is not griefing. shouting slurs or toxic language on all chat is griefing. 
---
YOU ONLY ABLE TO SPAWN AT WHITESPRING BUG IS BACK. 
---
Last night I literally had to quit the game because it was unplayable. I got the "you can only spawn at Whitespring" bug and I couldn't spawn because I had aggrod a guard with a shotgun blast on accident. Couldn't play my toon as the ONLY place to revive was the one place that hated me. So I alt f4 and rage quit. Very upsetting that every time I come back and play, and old bug is back :(
---
See my edit in the OP. 
---
I'm not privy to what goes in the game design, but I would hesitate to exclaim it's a "separate or not" without confirmation from Bethesda
---
Just played a new character got lvl 8 in Morgantown and questioned myself why a lvl 215 got after me like a maniac xD didn't saw that i was  number 2.
---
When I read that a percentage of whatever you were carrying gets dropped I used my noggin and put all my stimpacks but like 10 in my stash before going into survival. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You ain't wrong. These comments have subsided my fears. 
---
Just look up the info yourself
---
I wish they would just do a big CAMP overhaul/upgrade.  So much of it is just pointless annoyance limiting people's creativity.  
---
You mean with a stealthboy or chameleon armor?
---
Holy crap!
---
Shoot, my bad. I've run that event a ton but never got it. I'll edit or remove.
---
This game mode is for everyone. Don‚Äôt be entitled. Makes you look small minded.  
---
Second: pipe rifles can still do work in the right hands just like AAE and TSE. 
---
And farming west tek. Sounds like you shouldn‚Äôt be in survival either.
---
But hey. 
---
That‚Äôs what I mean,I enjoy it in many other games but for 76 it just doesn‚Äôt feel quite right. I feel it doesn‚Äôt add another dimension to the gameplay 
---
I don‚Äôt really regret it.  1500 is still less than what old PA skins sold for. 
---
I agree with you that people will expect a guarantee as you said, and that would open up a can of worms. However the fact that so many people figured it was a dev error and the conspiracy theory that followed wasn‚Äôt really positive for FO76 fans. 
---
Said no one ever üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You got me there 
---
My bad. Post removed.
---
In this idea, can a team of raiders lay a raid claim on a "Single claimed" workshop?  If they can then its really not very much different from how it works now.  Except for the cap cost.
---
This üëç
---
I guess you just proved my point.  It was obviously a kid who should know better, but clearly did not. 
---
Uh, no? You brought RPG into it by bringing up RPG mechanics, and I responded with a game that uses those same mechanics-- i.e. levels, gear, etc. I argued against your simplistic contention that games that use xp and gear are more about those things than skill, which is quite obviously untrue.
---
I also don't know why you'd call my gear 'shit' when you don't have any clue what I'm using other than weapon, or what my opponent was using. Speculate much?
---
Stealth boy + Secret agent perk = invisible longer
---
We stashed most of it but like 30 stims, 30 radaway, and various food items. Oh, and all the perfectly persevered pie we have collected.
---
This feature is necessary for proper RP. Bethesda please make our character name display instead of the account name. This is such a small but important thing. You have no idea how much you are limiting the RP playstyle with the decision or oversight that made our characters display the account name.
---
I was VERY surprised to see only one color for the neon letters since there's like 5 different colors in Fallout 4
---
How long was the fight? 
---
üòÇ dang
---
Offload your aid and caps to an middleman mule. I‚Äôm using it from now on to buy armor and do trades for me, while I have fun with my gear. The mule just stays parked with everything I‚Äôm trying to sell or use. 
---
I‚Äôll walk into Survival with nearly 0 caps and 0 aid. 
---
That way, I‚Äôm not losing from the start if it die.
---
If I gain caps and aid, and lose them, I won‚Äôt be frustrated cause they aren‚Äôt actually mine. I‚Äôll offload when I‚Äôm done playing or if I want to transfer my things for a trade.
---
Minimize expenses my dude.
---
Oh noooo! :( I was planning to go nuts when I got home from when, I didn't realize it stopped at a particular time. 
---
I really wanted the fastnacht recipe as silly as that is. 
---
I feel that! I purposely took out One Foundation block on the bottom of mine so people can actually break in and fight me. That said I much prefer just going out in hunting the top three people. 
---
Yea dude, that's my opinion. The Nuclear Winter playerbase (context helps) would suffer greatly. Because the whole point of playing a hardmode is increased challenge, and Bethesda allowing OP players with tons of crafting plans and gear to waltz in and offer that around would ruin that challenge. 
---
We're already seeing it with the Survival mode. If you want to stick your head in the sand, have fun. xD
---
Damn I‚Äôm getting worn out just thinking about pressing a button one extra time per session. 
---
**How does anyone who's played this game still not understand how stealth effects work?**
---
I am flabbergasted!
---
Rare is the hunters long coat, a tse gun, the Charleston vendor, things that you can actually obtain after 400 hours of your life grinding at a game. 
---
You can not tell me that it's fair to advertise an event that lasts one week, with most of your advertisements glorifying these 5 masks and then have what, one or two confirmed drops, out of how many people playing for how many hours? 
---
As I said in other posts, it's a cosmetic item, heavily advertized, in a game where most long time fallout players are collectors. What on earth is the purpose of not allowing a higher drop rate. 3 people get to feel accomplished while everyone else feels they wasted their time? Shouldnt most of the player base feel there is some reward for the time they put into a game. 
---
No one really complains about how hard it is to get a tse gun, because we know it IS POSSIBLE, and we have time to do it even if it takes forever. 
---
This was just handled very poorly. Even if one out of every 50-100 drops was one of the advertised masks theyd still be rare, still highly tradable and sought after and the event would not have felt like a grind for nothing. 
---
Some stealth boys last 2 minutes. A lot can happen in 2 minutes. 
---
You really think your comment with no reasoning even backing it, just your shit opinion with no argument, was any better than my comment pointing out why you‚Äôre a salty butthurt turd?
---
People can rationalize anything to their benefit I guess.
---
You took a level 6 character into PVP mode...
---
I'm not even going to bother to finish writi
---
are you trying to say that server hopping is not possible anymore when a nuke has been launched?
---
the thing is that until you are blocked from leaving the idea of the OP wont hurt anyone that is able to press the keys to server hop.
---
You said your gear was decent and not PvP oriented.  You lost to someone who was PvP oriented and quit. You refuse to learn stagger mechanics. Bye
---
Yeah everyone seems to be losing approx half their stimpacks every time PLUS half their healing salve. That's a hard NO from me for now
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt agree to there being a stash, maybe just a bedroll, tent, cooking pit, and -maybe- 1 crafting bench... but this game is easy enough on the survival regard- there‚Äôs no need to make it easier with a portable stash that essentially makes carry weight null and void.
---
Actually if anything, Power Armor needs buffs to their Damage resistances.  
---
I think the main people that still don‚Äôt like it are the ones who smash through it as quick as possible. I‚Äôm a casual gamer, I maybe get an hour or 2 in every few days. So for me wandering around(not even doing the quests really) is fun enough and what I spent most of my time doin in 4 anyways. 
---
Maybe for realism? Water pumps and crops can't produce or grow through wood or concrete.
---
Basically you Have to make a character to be able to access survival. No prebuilt. 
---
Excellent other than the fact i went on Survival mode went to whitesprings, and then lost a ridiculous amount of money getting killed by a one shot sniper Plus lost most of my meds. Also the Invincibility doesn't work properly when you reload as i kept getting sniped.
---
Don't travel with lots of meds in survival. Go bare bones
---
I think if it's in a random location it should be invisible to the player base however if it is near fissure prime I think it should remain on the Map so that people can flock to it to help kill the boss. Thoughts about this from anyone else?
---
hahaha
---
yep.
---
CASUAL MODE PLEASE 
---
You, again, assume that the other person had PVP gear. And yes, decent, not shit. Choose your words carefully in the future.
---
Yeah man, it‚Äôll be a good day when the camp gets protected in passive mode too. 
---
I've drank 20+ nukashine and experienced the blackout every time. It's not completely random, but there must be a fairly large pool of spots you can end up because I've only landed in the same place twice.
---
I think they should just not have insane drop rates.  Even a drop rate like 5% with all of the possible masks it would have been a real task to collect all of the rare ones.    
---
If nothing else, separate things into like 4 categories, Uber rare, Rare, Uncommon, and Common.  Keep the absurd sub 1% drop rate for ONE item, then a few rares, a few more uncommons, and the bulk in commons.  So everyone gets a little something, you can work at it to get the cooler stuff, and you might hit a random jackpot.  
---
this is literally this sub anytime *anything* happens. it is *always* a division of two extremes. its so tired.
---
So... do workshops still receive damage when attacked by another player?
---
&gt;	Every player should be equality in Survival Mode only
---
Now I have no interest in survival mode, but how does it even make sense to make everyone equal? That entirely removes the point of making armor/weapon/perk builds  
---
Unless I‚Äôm missing something. Not to be rude at all but it seems like your English may not be very strong. It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm missing what you‚Äôre saying. 
---
But more to the point of your post title, power armor is just straight up bad for PvP. 
---
Pathetic. Toxic behavior includes blind support for a game and rage against any critic. 
---
PA camo paint has been since release and it is discounted only 30%, you don't see that kind of discount on that bundle. With that kind of discount, that bundle would cost over 4k and that would make sense.
---
Nintendo Switch will still be Nintendo Switch, just like PS4 is PS4Pro. 
---
Couldn't agree more. Just got one shot killed twice and then lost all my stuff. Just whack balance
---
Are you on PC? I can't see any other items in the shop except ones I've already got?!?!
---
I would gladly buy this.  I have tricentennial on the few objects that accept it, but much that I want to keep won't accept skins.
---
There are bugs with the chameleon effects. You don‚Äôt come out of it and still remain stealthed. 
---
Hence the second part of my comment. 
---
It would be so much more frustrating to have to go into your setting each time to switch.
---
I lost 80% of my aid
---
Remember to offload everything before you begin such that you don‚Äôt lose anything that isn‚Äôt actually yours.
---
When they use that you still see them, I was in a cargo box waiting for them and they just killed me out of no where
---
How it works makes no difference to me - if it keeps them off the non PVP server so they leave lower level people/those not interested in PvP alone, I'll consider it a great update.
---
Randomise the fast travel spot so people can't camp and take people out at will when they load in. Please
---
why TF are you all carrying so many items you can lose?
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many people think the fact that you can turn invisible in this is cheating. üòÇ
---
True, but even if it‚Äôs say 20% of what you have carrying around 200 aid items is still going to have you dropping quite a bit every time you die. I wasn‚Äôt saying you should be dropping all of your items I was just saying it‚Äôs also silly to go in carrying that much. 
---
I mean, that does no good. Because the no lifers will have an OP character in 2 weeks again and we'll be back to right now.
---
I get i can offload my AID and JUNK items, but i can't store my caps.
---
The point of my publication, is that when launching the nuclear missile, nobody will know where it will fall, only the one that throws it.
---
If you still show the affected area on the map, it would not bother
---
The fun would be to instill fear in everyone.
---
Way to respond to a pre patch post.  Anyway, your perception does not allow you to vats stealth boys. And I'm a assassins/cavalier build anyway I'm not hiding, I'm just responding to this players inquiry.  And he very well can hide from you by just not being near you or the top players indicated on the map.
---
Ridic i agree
---
Been on the same boat for ages; though that people would appreciate the heads-up. 
---
In other survival you dont have a limit on ur stash box
---
I‚Äôd say probably 15 a piece is a good starting point for negotiation. I wouldn‚Äôt go above 25 or below 10.
---
Spawn protection is in effect for a few or until you raise your weapon. Spawnpoints mean nothing in the event of saving you.
---
Are you really this daft? It doesn't matter if it's a MOBA or an RPG, officially. It matters that in both contexts we're talking about a PVP situation that includes gear and levels. 
---
I mean, you're not even offering a reason for why it being a MOBA in particular has any bearing on the conversation. You just act like it matters... so why does it matter? You argue that gear and XP trump skill in a PVP context, so explain why that's any different in DOTA? 
---
And while you're obsessing over the MOBA aspect, explain to me how your logic is equally bad when applied to WoW, which IS a fully-realized RPG? 
---
Little billy lived in a drive for YEARS 
---
I that case.....to counter the spawn campers, my plan is to drink a nukashine and see where I end up :)
---
Respawn at your camp.  Id they don't knew she it is they can't doesn camp you.
---
Thanks for the info, modes a big nope from me then
---
I also have this problem 
---
I can understand why they wouldn't want to do that.  Look at how they balanced it.  It's almost designed in such a way that "new" characters should NEVER be in there.  The bounty cost alone is prohibitive and if you're over level 50 you'd better have 1000 or more caps available cause you're losing 100 per death!
---
Making them start Naked isn't too bad a plan...but what about things in stash.  Deleting things from stash seems excessive as well.  I wouldn't mind seeing "mode-locked" gear, salty as that would make people though.  Make it so that current legendaries are "Adventure locked" and you can find/earn legendaries in survival mode which may, or may not, be "survival locked"...but that would make transferring legendary items earned in adventure mode less game breaking in survival mode.
---
Easier to just disable legendary effects though.
---
what's your point?
---
do you mean you would like to have every gameplay settings available as a choosealbe option when you start a new session? because it's "just an extra press of a button"?
---
the options are there for a reason.
---
So its probably cheaper for them to supply the whales with store based stuff than to make an entirely new game, in general.
---
Because you can't fast travel between things on the same server. Sure you could spend the time bothering to switch worlds just to fast travel if you *really* want, but restricted fast-travel in Survival prevents you from popping  straight over to where that person with the bounty is.
---
The contrary argument to that would be, seeing as you have stuff to lose, and other people gain it when you lose it, that there is something to be gained.
---
RIGHT?? I didn‚Äôt even realize the colour was limited to blue until after I‚Äôd blown my caps on the plan. I‚Äôd love to see them bring back some red or purple - my CAMP was previously a med bay, and the signs would have fit in so much better if they were just red instead of blue. 
---
Power should have more defense. The stuff can take tank rounds but a pair of knuckles can trash it. Nah. Give it more defense across the board and jack up the power use drain from the core. Trade off and whatnot. 
---
man this sub is shit.
---
[here is the link to info about survival mode. no additional snark.](https://bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019)
---
Seems overly complex.  But efficient for all that.
---
Its early and people are still at work :)
---
Going to be a few more hours before I can get on.....
---
What‚Äôs the word on the ‚Äúcap‚Äù for player damage? Can I finally not worry about running some janky bloodied build and play normally and actually run around at full hp?
---
Or do I still need to be a bloodied mess to kill people?
---
that and having the guy who camped you spam music and tell you to go back to ez mode is also a turn off. Honestly there should be a wall of shame or something on reddit 
---
Any PVP game should be skilled-based if it's meant to be taken seriously. I guess that may not be the case here... yet? xD
---
I was on my alt character. You have to be level 60 if you want to make a full build
---
And then what if you lost 9 or all 10 on one death. That's fair to you? Plus that random beer you picked up. Plus the couple fruits or whatever you picked up. Oh and those two purified waters. 
---
That's ridiculous, not balanced, and most importantly not fun with the way PVP is so skewed. This entire mode has some really weird design decisions. 
---

---
Could be latency related.   Will have to test more I think.   Too early to yell about things being broken though, it's beta. By all means point it out however.  I can see people complaining others are  unkillable or they are doing too much damage.  Still too early lol
---
I have yet to buy atoms but I‚Äôm sure someday they‚Äôll drop something I Need and $10-20 will look more appealing than chasing down 30 challenges. 
---
I really shouldn't be surprised. I know how many posts are still made about "being killed with pacifist on", but for cryin' out loud, this is an actual mechanic in the game, not some poorly explained toggle in a menu.
---
I feel you I had to start a new character just for survival (15 endurance and agility) bc my main even tho he‚Äôs over 100 he‚Äôs mainly for crafting and building. For the parade I made a character whose just for gathering. He has 15 luck and charisma. A big problem I‚Äôm running into is that I only have one other friend I play with and to really do well in survival I need more people. 
---
United We Stand 
---
Whitesprings, westek, watoga. The three W's.
---
Harper's is OK. There are also locations with a static spawn mob which can roll either boss (crown icon) or legendary. But it's still RNG. Seems to be like 75/25 crown/leg.
---
Yeah... that's in the patch notes. It's so players can freely switch between modes at play start. 
---
I expect they might have a "hardcore only" character selection at some point, but it makes little sense at this stage, when the survival environment is still in beta. 
---
East coast of the us. I haven't bought one because they're so hard to find. I've been to a couple gun shows and shops and no one has had any russian ones. 
---
there is no fear until you disable to leave the server and disable fast travel.
---
It is a well know easy spawn for the Responder Vendor Bot. But he won‚Äôt spawn if there is a camp there.
---
Yes you can. Get another character with 0 caps. Get a trustworthy buddy, give all your caps to him, sell him an item for all the caps back on the other character.
---
Unless you have. 5 max caps characters already, in which I would say... you don‚Äôt need to PvP.
---
Yeah but it Separates the one who clearly can do it and the ones who can‚Äôt.  Plus the time spent can ripple down and affect the future of pvp and other things. Something we can‚Äôt plan for or know yet. 
---
It's a nice sentiment, and I hope that Bethesda can take the feedback and improve the mode. 
---
That said, I'm still baffled that they seemed to completely ignore the major feedback push to stop players from transferring over OP pre-existing characters. So it doesn't bode well. I still haven't even seen them justify that decision (I have some ideas why they went down that road, but it would still be nice for them to respond directly). 
---
You get downvoted probably because of the raider tag or the salty people who still don‚Äôt understand workshops are about PvP.
---
Hell some ppl probably didn‚Äôt even read the comment, just saw raiders tag and a few downvoted already there and their brainless sheep mind jumped right on the thumbs down button. 
---
Not where I am, 8pm :)
---
That would be fair, if that is what was happening. The problem is that it's not happening that way and instead you lose all or nearly all of the 200 items. 
---
That's why people are calling it broken. If you lost 20% of those items there wouldn't be a problem, I would strongly disagree with someone who said that was an issue. But we aren't in that world right now. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt cost a lot of junk to rebuild, what is there to fear?
---
Yeah, if they had more skins for weapons and sold in bulk (like the poses were) I'd be tempted to drop a bit...
---
Look on the bright side; if you kill someone with 200 aid items, you can get it all back in one swoop!
---
I'll be home in an hour &gt;=]
---
Current MMO market is very limited, with only old MMOs like WoW, Gw2, ESO and FFIV on the west, so Fo76 is a fresh multiplayer experience that many MMO players consider playing for the coming months and spend their money on it.
---
my expectation is that most players will stick with a given mode and not switch the mode on every session.
---
you might play differently but i think you would be the minority in this regard.
---
In other games you can stash away as much as you want to
---
You can‚Äôt respawn the ghouls anymore just by logging into the server, so why do you even care? Go farm and level elsewhere, trust me or you‚Äôll be burned out on the game in no time.
---
In the shops it's called the brahmin pen but at camp it's the fertilizer producer under the resource tab. It's a wheelbarrow with some hay bails
---
Likewise, also curious about how switching between the 2 game options works, I‚Äôm not even bothering with it until I have far more information lol.
---
You just gave me an idea to GTFO quickly of a bad situation in survival. Pop a Nukashine. The AP bonus will let you outrun anyone and if its not enough the blackout will make sure you're "Out of Dodge" 
---
Just carry fewer. Knowing that you have the chance to drop aid items, just carry fewer aid items. Nobody needs 80 rad away on hand right fucking now. 
---
No different in level mobs scale up but not loot. Level 91 can drop 45-50 stuff. 
---
I dont ever get on and make posts like this, just seems the difference is pretty drastic from yesterday to today.
---
Ok. Gonna hold off on those until after the four horsemen p.a paint jobs come out. Been saving my atoms for those
---
Seriously, this sub is in desperate need of some moderation. Most other subs create a stickied megathread for things like this and actively delete the 300 extraneous posts. 
---
Not even close. It‚Äôs 75%
---
if you want to stay on a server you can still fasttravel to 76.
---
there is no fear. none. nothing. zero.
---
That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. Do those people run on like 10HP or something. Because with the slap damage they‚Äôre is no way you can get killed, unless you literally don‚Äôt do anything.
---
I use Stealth boys on occasion when sniping someone at close range and I get called a cheater all the time. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It still easy to find out who owns it...it just takes more work rather that straight up displaying it on the map.  I'd rather avoid the problem entirely, not just make it slightly harder to do.  
---
As for deleting ALL legendaries?....naa, too much.  Just keep them out of survival.  If they did that I might even be willing to try out the mode.  As it's currently implemented though?  Naa.  
---
I wish they had set it up to actually have players on level ground.  Make it so that you had to start a new character in survival mode (similar to "Hardcore Mode" in Diablo...) and can't transfer characters...OR ITEMS...back and forth between modes.   But a lot of players probably wouldn't have bothered, not after putting so much time into their level 300+ adventure character with all the awesome gear.  It WOULD have made the mode better balanced though, and gotten a lot of the more "casual" players into it.
---
I thought that before and now it's just being proven. How Bethesda could be so ignorant to allow it is beyond me.
---
As much as I would like solo maps, I am fairly certain this will never happen. 
---
Its still in beta
---
Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs still beta for it. 
---
No you only remain invisible on your screen,  other players can still see you. 
---
Yup. That can happen when getting shot. That, too, is part of a survival game. 
---
This is LITERALLY what all those "raiders" and "wolves" were crying for. No slap damage, no warning, rewards for killing players... this is it. And now... now the salt is starting. Seems to me that it's just not that fun to them now that they're on the receiving end of it. 
---
No shit anyone can see that, these are just some suggestions for the developers.
---
You are not had to explain to friends last night was the last night not today. 
---
I agree, this is horribly disappointing.  I don't see them changing after this "beta". Current characters can still dip in and get xp bonus.  I think this roll out is dumb. Why make it back and forth during a "beta"? Hey, hurry up and bring your duped and exploited gear over to this great new mode! Sounds like a big camper exploit unfair bs feat
---
Just limited
---
Never. 
---
When you kill someone the other player can pay 200caps to put a bounty on your head.
---
But will quickly trend toward "most kills" the longer the server is up. 
---
The entire game is still in beta.
---
I just saw the second part of your post, and it's hilarious. You still don't get it. 
---
I don't accept the current situation as fun or good. Ergo, your contention that I'm 'not learning' or that I want your advice is hilariously off-base. I don't want to learn how to win with gear. And a stagger would not have helped me win that fight. So your advice is bad. 
---
If you enjoy that kind of drek, cool. Have fun being a shitty PVPer who thinks one-shots and imbalanced gear is OK, because that's exactly what you are. :-/
---
good point, maybe the camps are not so lucky 
---
Yeah then I probably will never play survival then because I really don't like being at a disadvantage if I don't have a group myself. Classic shooters usually balance yourself onto a team or put you on free for all and the game mode just doesn't sit with me currently.
---
Keyring has been in a couple of FO games so it‚Äôs just absurd that they took it out. 
---
It really kinda pisses me off. Like, apparently "some aid items" that you drop on death is literally all of your stimpacks and over 60% of your liquor. 
---
Like, I like the punishment, but I shouldn't have to grind for stims in Adventure mode after only an hour in Survival. 
---
you can put this mode setting into the options where it belongs?
---
I would love for people to look over and see
---
#CHAD THUNDERDONG
---
running towards the nearest enemy to punch it into dust.
---
I'm saying why pvp when the cost is so high. 
---
How do we get the spores? Is it when heart of the swamp is up? Or just finished? Random? 
---
In some, sure. In others, no. 
---
In other games, you also lose everything upon death, too.
---
So, do you want this to be like "other games" or just some aspects of "other games" that benefit you, but not other aspects of "other games" that don't benefit you?
---
There are two variants of most foods, but with corn in particular I find that one floats and one doesn't?
---
I used to use the foundation exploit to plant crop on flat surfaces (took up a lot of space but it worked) and I found that one variant would snap to the foundation whereas the other wouldn't? Try switching between the two to and see which works best. As for razorgrain... 
---
You cannot get into it by swimming if you are not me or on my team
---
Well you're wrong about the TSE weapons but that's just a technicality. Those are either bloodied or anti armor but yes still explosive. However there will never be a solution to stop people from grouping up. So how are you going to balance that? I understand the frustration but my point is don't offer a problem without a solution.
---
I believe on T-45. 
---
I appreciate that there‚Äôs a quick and easy ‚Äòrebuild‚Äô option from the CAMP station, or even manually through the edit function but I‚Äôm not sure I trust it... I laboured to get final pieces to go green and snap in. It‚Äôs OCD mentality, maybe, but that‚Äôs me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It was instant. I can't see how they could respond that quickly.
---
yes, but the DLC's bring new players and the same % of whales exist for these newbies.  Also, DLC's bring old wales who might have topped playing back to the game.
---
At some point though there's diminishing returns, and that's the very moment that Fallout 76 2 get's announced.
---
When you obtain and learn primed LMG receiver (drop from SBQ or bought from market..), you can make ultracite 308 ammo - 72 (+-) on max ammosmith in one batch with 1 fluorescent flux (easily harvested from WS or cheaply bought)... Ultra 308 is quite more powerful even on normal targets and literally deadly for SB.
---
Look at the mod and what it says it scraps to.  If black titanium,  they are for excavator. 
---
I like the idea, but there'd have to be a LOT of restrictions on it to minimize the potential for abuse.  The build limit is one thing, but you'd also need to look at where they could be placed (could you block off a resource node?), the size of their footprint, etc.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
The roadmap is all content this game should have had on launch as part of the base game.
---
The "content season" for this game has as much appeal as the base game has, which is little to none.
---
This entire thing has hurt the Fallout franchise to a near irreparable degree in the eyes of those who aren't Bethesda shills.
---
Spawn camping in multiplayer?  When does that ever happen?
---
With the best pa in the game and a endurance of 7 I shouldn‚Äôt be so easily one shouted, also when I died I dropped 150 stimpacks!! 
---
I like the idea of a nuke zone-esque highlighted area where the top players are.  Preferably a bit bigger but still gives you a general idea of their location.
---
You are supposed to kill, kill, and kill. Todd demands blood.
---
Per the patch notes:
---
&gt;When killed during PVP combat, players can choose to spend a portion of their Caps to place a Bounty on their killer. This will mark that player as Wanted and display the Bounty amount on all other players‚Äô Maps. Half of the Caps spent by the slain player will appear as the Bounty reward, and the minimum cost to place a Bounty is 200 Caps.
---
According to a couple posts, that bounty carries over to adventure mode as well, so your best bet is to drop your aid and wait for someone to find you, or pop over to adventure mode and hope someone kills you there.
---
Lets change the title of this post so its not so misleading 
---
"Already players better then me in survival!" 
---
It is pretty much stealing their caps by abusing flaws in bounty system, so it is griefing in a way. But I guess it depends on your definition of the term.
---
I like this idea but at the same token I‚Äôd would also like a radio beacon of some kind to tune into and find the nuke zone. 
---
Huh a few fast travel locations? Also don't know what you're talking about. I've played since day 1 and I've literally only had 1 person unsuccessfully try to kill me. I just made him waste all his minigun ammo and went about my way. 
---
Also have a bunch of non desc mods collecting dust, will monitor this post.
---
Me too... I‚Äôd love to try it though with some confidence about rebuilds 
---
*cough* aliens *cough*
---
most PvP player will have low budget camps anyway because high budget camps would be grinded all day long.
---
and the very small number of players that still want to build high budget camps can still build in the forest where you can't drop nukes.
---
Is this against one person or different people? I imagine critical hits go through cavaliers like they do sentinel. I also bet you can be staggered too.
---
Do you even pvp?
---
I think they are for excavator 
---
HA! 
---
Look at what it scraps to. If it‚Äôs black titanium it‚Äôs for the excavator. I can‚Äôt remember what the other option is. I thought it was ultracite but I may be remembering that wrong. 
---
Cant drop, can't sell, can't put into a world stash...
---
Wouldn't it have been simpler to just have a binary tag for each access key to say if you had it? Remove them completely from the inventory, especially since they keep claiming it is the number of items we are carying or in our stash that is causing all the server instability?
---
Oh you talking about survival. Too early in the morning. My dumbass was like wtf you on about. üòÇ
---
People would just team up outside of the game, like on discord, and kill everyone that's actually playing solo. 
---
Then move somewhere people won't be.
---
That's dumb if it is that way, if so my friend can keep on killing me forever and get caps out of nowhere, basically infinite caps...
---
The Power Armor Buff: this guy never takes off his power armor, even if he's just in his camp and has 10 charge left in his last fusion core.  He  also almost excessively uses his gatling plasma.
---
Yeah I think people overstate how often this happens (or maybe it's more common on console), because I take several workshops each day and have never had it happen to me (level 210) or anyone I know. Still needs fixing, but doesn't seem as common as some say. 
---
I was excited for survival. I havent played FO76 for months now. I was waiting to replay the game in survival. But they still cling to their plan to allow all characters in any mode, and thats not fun to me. I guess Ill go on playing other games until Bethesda does pvp right. At least they made train stations spawn points. Its cool that they listened to this suggeation.
---
Yeah the bounty system is going to need a lot of fine tuning I suspect. I think it is necessary because it will give low level players a way to retaliate against high level griefers, but it also means any time you kill someone with caps to spare you'll end up with a bounty, even if you're not the aggressor. Maybe put a timer on bounties? 
---
If you can see the inventory, its claimable.  Enjoy. Just in passing; I lost my  X01 jet pack which was attached to a torso and  I had just attached them to a PA frame  (to save stash weight), when the server disconnected me.  When I logged back in and everything loaded, I got a notification that the power armor was being returned to inventory.  It hit inventory alright. Sans torso and jet pack. That all sucks for me, but oh well.  My point is that there have been many posts about people losing their armor because they had dropped them instead of placing them from their inventories then experiencing disconnect (X instead of A.) One player posted he lost all 5 sets of PA because he just wanted to see them all out in a line and snap a selfie with them.  I just wanted to warn people to be careful and vigilant when adjusting or playing around with their spare armor.  You can lose it very easily.  In your case, I think you were the beneficiary of someone who just wanted to get rid of armor they no longer wanted or needed.  I gave away a full set of Raider armor as soon as I completed my T60.  I left it in Morgantown Train Station with a full core for someone. Hope they got it.
---
Limited time Event based on a real Spring celebration. It'll probably be back next year around the same time.
---
Short version: go to Helvetia, do a couple fetch quests for some robots, then follow them as they parade around town. Protect them against enemies until they finish the parade, get some unique rewards including holiday-themed masks, recipes and plans for your CAMP.
---
Today I lost all of my Junk, Aid items and 2000 Caps but I also made a new friend who didn't greet me with a bullet to the face üòÑ
---
20-30 capacity stash that still counts toward your actual stash, kind of like the fermenter.
---
Honestly,the fast travel thing is what I'd be most interested in.
---
I'm also east coast of the US. You missed the golden age of SKS and Mosins. Pure Russian SKS's arent rare but they're not common either. It's morbid but estate sales are often a good place to get those kinda pure weapons because people normally sit on things like that. 
---
Back to adventure we go..
---
Edit, enemies 
---
No you can‚Äôt 
---
Well, thank you for letting the world know. God knows I wasn't going back.
---
But it would put him on the leader board for kills and make him a target. It‚Äôs not very much at a time
---
True I don't revolve my life around this game, but I stood there and shot him with 100x .44 ammo and meleed him until my fire axe broke. No damage. He took out a knife, stabbed me once and I died.
---
This is at level 30, handgun build. If I can't budge his health like that, wtf is the point of trying against someone who will fight back?
---
Oh, I think those guys paying big caps for the sentinel assassin's or cavalier assassin's armor with the chameleon kicker and bloodied explosive lever actions and whatnot take it real serious already.
---
Any mod that doesn't specify which armor it's for is for excavator.  
---
&gt;realism
---
Next time you survive a missle straight to the face i want you to say realism to yourself 50 times.
---
This
---
I think I only got the donut recipe on one of my characters, and it wasn't even my "main."
---
Support small business and buy them from your local vault dwellers bar*.
---
*Not available on all platforms. Supplies limited.
---
Uhh, people who rely on gear to win PVP are the carebears who need hand-holding.   
---
What a joke you are. xD
---
That‚Äôs another bug to list too and I believe you when you say 150 stimpacks because this game can prove such things lmao
---
Honestly, the masks weren't the main draw for me. It's the recipes (donuts!) and CAMP plans.
---
It‚Äôs not really grouping up in survival however when people are in a team then damage should be slightly nerfed; I see that as a way to balance things out especially if it‚Äôs 3 people in a group against 1 player all by himself.
---
And if you can hold out for Rose's Syringer negative affects to kick in...
---
West Virginia is fairly close to DC. Not a surprise if some random scavenger took one into WV on his travels.
---
It‚Äôs been up for an hour and you‚Äôre learning you shouldn‚Äôt carry more than a handful of aid items at once. 
---
I‚Äôve had 48 years of realism. I get a whole dose of realism when i wake up everydayüòé. Trust me, if they were looking for ‚Äúrealism‚Äù they better just start over. 
---
Anyone care to explain what "obys" means?
---
Yes you can. Outside the train station I kept respawning not only in the same spot but I was killed while loading each time 
---
yes you can, i still had the loading screen,  and i hear BANG BANG BANG
---
 once i can see the world, i see myself dead on the ground, with 2 lvl 200+ players teabagging me
---
plus, there are lots of other reports of this
---
and I'm saying that it's "right there in the name of the mode". 
---
So many players wanted high risk high reward (or claimed to want it), but it seems to me that a lot of those players figured it was a one way street. That "swinging dick" in vanilla Fo76 meant they were gonna be King Shit in survival.
---
This IS what the PvP players wanted. Now it seems they want rewards that outvalue their own risk. It doesn't work that way. You want a reward? it has to come from somewhere. 
---
Supposedly the "risk" was what "made the game fun" (had that argument tossed at me a lot... you can dig through my history if you wish, I'm not going back to find it) ‚Ä¶ but that comment came from the "wolves" that got off on attacking PvE players who didn't want to PvP at all; those players that justified attacking PvE players as "being part of the Fallout experience, I'm just a raider, bro".
---
So, here's the risk, by raider logic, this should be the most fun they've ever had.
---
People can camp your spawns and kill you while you load 
---
i might just buy it cos I use leather and metal, and those are exclusive to the pack, too bad they dont discount for the already owned skins
---
PA is trash for PVP. It's like wearing nothing. Wear regular armor. 
---
Up yours for mentioning Indiana Jones before I could!
---
Take my upvote!
---
Is survival as toxic as I expect it to be?
---
Make room in your stash. Stash management isn't a new issue.
---
They're likely being used both ways. 
---
I like to build around in-game content (currently my camp is built around a monorail car) which means that the only mobility is tearing it down and doing a full rebuild around another in-game object... ;(
---
with free atoms ofc
---
Wonder if tank killer perk that is supposed to  "ignore" armor actually ignores armor now. If so, I suggest that you don't get shot.
---
They have a flag system they created they could just set it to that people within a given time if they have been within X set distance and have not killed each other within X time it would flag them, If this is done over a course of a very long time period it would alert Bethesda " Hey these two users are teaming in solo only " and the only problem is it could false flag people.
---
Leader of the pack event (or similar name) near the vault,  a bunch of dogs,  three different low level legendaries
---
So, they can kill you if you haven't even spawned in yet?
---
Armor doesn't mean anything in PvP.
---
You gotta craft it lol
---
This actually happened to me last night. Two different Mothman showed up to my camp while I was AFK and destroyed my Mothman stature, but nothing else.
---
I just kinda feel like.. I need to find 5 god tier items if I want a full pvp set, ya know? And finding 5 god tier items is... hard.
---
The idea that you aren't forced to have a unique Survival character and can come and go between means I won't bother with Survival.  Crazy dupe-weapon filled characters will always be stronger.
---
Such a waste of development resources.
---
There needs to be 2 different camps because of this.
---
Neon lights and PvP don't mix well.
---
You guys rock!
---
During the latency part while your spawned but not in control 
---
A Fasnacht Beret from a vendor? Where?
---
that wouldd be cool!
---
Are camps protected in adventure mode?  Or can somebody still level my camp just to be a jerk?
---
I‚Äôve always wanted clean objects from Fallout 3 till now. It never really makes sense to me that, in the other games, you‚Äôre decades and even centuries out from the apocalypse and have the ability to build complex weapons, fusion generators, medicine, robots and more. 
---
Yet, for some reason you can‚Äôt clean up the pile of rubble in the road, cut the grass, or repaint a wall. If you‚Äôre supposed to be rebuilding the world why can‚Äôt we rebuild it with something nice if we want to put the time and caps into it? 
---
Thanks a lot, if it‚Äôs not there in my game should I just go to a new server?
---
\*sighs\*
---
Yea, I'm just gonna walk away from this mode. And probably from the feedback process, too. It's just going to be a lot of bickering and likely no major changes on Beth's end.
---
If they ever implement 'fresh chars only' I'd give it another try. Until then, I'm just gonna hope they don't ruin Nuclear Winter in the same way. :-p  
---
Some of y‚Äôall never played Minecraft and it shows 
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Just run into the little red bridge south of the station and when you come back to the station, something will randomly spawn by that little pond. Sometime super mutants or molerats and sometimes the vendor bot with his cow and stuff. GL
---
It‚Äôs Less than 15 seconds? That‚Äôs... barely enough time to get out of VATS range at a trainstation. 
---
Bethesda knows what side their bread is buttered on. When the game was at its most broken, most unplayable, there were those players farming whitesprings 20 hours a day with duped gear, they stuck it through and refused to quit (and posted a lot on reddit)
---
Far be it from them to anger those 80 or so people.
---
Gottem
---
You as one player get to use the lone wanderer perk. If you don't have it that's on you. But please don't suggest that damage be nerfed while in a team. If they try that, it'll break and no one will be able to group up for a month.
---
This was a post-patch post about survival, what are you talking about.
---
My perception points me directly to you on my compass from a incredibly long distance away since my perception is 32. For example you could be at the main white springs station and I could be at black water mine and you will still be a red dot on my compass. I‚Äôm not surprised you didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Full assassin cavalier and still don‚Äôt know basic game mechanics, you must have a generous ex-duper friend.
---
Look at your gear, look at your weapons. See what scrap you use for them and get rid of everything else.
---
Isn't there some kind of immunity during loading and briefly after?
---
I never wanted higher risks and I dont know anybody that did
---
It's from a side quest called An Organic Solution. Once you do it once you can repeat it, or just go by after someone else has done it. You'll need the quest for the recipe though
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm on PS4. 
---
Cappy from NukaWorld dances on your screen, aa you get closer to the stash the dance gets more vigorous.
---
damn, so something is wrong with my account, maybe need to relog
---
Yup. Sometimes, not always. So far, I've got a 100% success rate. 
---
And this isn't my first survival game. 
---
Hopefully every year
---
I suppose you‚Äôd be right about it breaking. We‚Äôll see what happens though
---
More powerful than a Scorchbeast Queen's screech
---
I love my spot too! Convenient, almost no enemy spawns but next door to a station ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh my!! Did you manage to put a licked door underwater ? 
---
The "Pay it Forward" player - Your inventory is packed full of goodies that, in your lower levels, would've scrapped or sold but you're not overburdened yet so you hold onto them. Then you travel to all the appropriate train stations matching item levels, find the brightest colored suitcase *(or only available container)*, and leave all the heavily modified armor, weapons, plans, ammo, commonly used junk, excess Stims, and cool clothing; sometimes legendary if your travels have been lucrative!  
---
Why? Because once upon a time you came across a container filled with various stuff, some of which you really were in need of, and now you want to continue the tradition of providing things that you could've sold for caps but opted not to. 
---
Yea, I've described myself, but it did indeed start from finding loot I needed in a suitcase. I loved that someone decided they'd leave their unneeded loot in a container for someone else to use, instead of a lunchbag which likely no player would even stumble across before it despawned. :) I also just like to help out, as that's "fun" for me.
---
Look at your ammo too. Only take ammo you use. 
---
I was just testing how bad it is. And its horrible 
---
Serendipity Perk?
---
How about, Fasnacht mask to sooth the pain?  Not a rare one though, coffee is for closers.
---
Yeah thats the best idea. 
---
Dyer Chemical is where you find the drums of chems and flushing system. Cool quest I thought
---
Your experience doesn't mean it's universal, I've had the debate with many players who claimed they did, and used the "with risk comes reward" argument to justify attacking and killing PvE players. 
---
So, I for one, am enjoying seeing those players get their shit smacked around and their stuff taken.
---
RIP Rotary engines and Hemis.
---
If all you‚Äôre gonna do is whine about survival why even go to that option.  Just stay in your adventure safe space.  
---
Nah while it would be nice to have more music I have heard that song during the beta
---
Charleston station. Someone must have sold it. Have found a VTU cap at a vendor before too. Cherry on the cake, I server hopped and got the wandering responder bot who had the hunter's longcoat and a clean straightjacket on him. After a week of pointless mask grinding that was a nice 5 minutes.
---
Counted the mole miners in uranium fever. Are the watoga bots friendly to you?
---
Luckily i got the beret the last time i played the event.
---
I did miss out on a couple of the camp items though. But i did get the 2 recipes, thats what i wanted most.
---
Oh God that's a good one, explosives are horrible on your stash, 6lb mini nukes 3 pound misses 1 pound 40mm also grenades they all weigh alot.
---
Love seeing people not paying enough attention to how the game works......this logic tells me this is your first Fallout game.....best of luck. Might want to make good use of google and figure out how many of the effects work in the game before labeling people as "cheaters" 
---
Yeah, I'm level 40, been playing since beta, and I've still never encountered him.
---
It would be thematically appropriate!
---
I think the changed that to breaking objects instead just hitting in the fastnacht patch
---
i am 90% sure the timer starts the instant you connect, even if you are just standing there loading everything and unable to move
---
Seriously, this is the only instrument I want in my camp
---
So you're someone who wants people to come to your base anyway? Stick to adventure then. 
---
Oh the lament of a generation who feels they should just get everything for showing up.  Participation ribbons all around.
---
Really? That sounds pretty awesome!
---
I don't know, you tell me what the point was. 
---
I just know walking in from Casual Mode with a good level, fully-geared PvP-build and headshotting a bunch of low level players near train stations isn't really what a "Survival Mode" is supposed to be... it's just kinda lame. 
---
What about scrap to build and what not? I Mena I have like absurd amounts of aid to. Like 220 radaway lol. I also have been hoarding for player vending 
---
Also go through your stash make sure all your junk is broken down. Sometimes I find a fan or a random typewriter in mine and those are pretty heavy.
---
I‚Äôve also noticed mine are much more perky now after the newest DLC. They fire more often and track targets better. Woohoo!
---
What aid do you never use? How many stimpaks do you regularly use and how often do you get them? And how many do you have on hand?
---
I keep 20 stims, 30 diluted, 10 super, spread between my inventory and stash, and sell any surplus. 
---
I sell any radx/diluted over 5 and radaway/diluted over 10. 
---
I keep 2 each of the chems that may help me. Sell the ones that don‚Äôt. 
---
Basically 10 dog food for when I can‚Äôt quickly go eat something that I just killed, 10 water. 
---
That‚Äôs my aid tab. 
---
I keep 200 acid, adhesive, oil, aluminum, steel, and lead. Bulked aluminum and lead because they weigh less that way. 
---
300 screws, springs, gears. 
---
Everything else under 100. 
---
It's the snap-to-floor function that needs a toggle function. Disable to clip items through environment/each other for fine detailing. ESO has this in limited spaces.
---
No, they‚Äôre marked red. Thanks for the tip about uranium fever!
---
PvP mode. Lots of butthurt whiners on there now. 
---
The Demolition Expert: Usually spotted at the nearest parking lot or traffic jam making sure no wheeled vehicles escape their fate. If a car door lands from the sky at your feet you know he's in the area. Also frequents the Fastnacht festival to drop a mini nuke or orbital strike on Old Man Winter. Always carries a Daisycutter and despite having Cola Nut uses all regular nuka cola for grenade crafting. He's the guy who takes all the 40mm you leave in the blue suitcase.
---
Adding my voice to the yes please vote
---
Sounds like you got smacked around pretty hard yourself
---
Apparently it isn‚Äôt long enough, because many of us are experiencing insta-death as soon as we can move around. 
---
I second this!
---
Because it's a lot less legit to grind gear in a cheat-laden carebear mode than trying to build up when there's an actual threat. 
---
I really hoped the snowflakes would leave survival alone for those who want a survival game that actually requires you to survive.  
---
Sadly it looks like they will just whine and bitch about it until it is merged into oblivion too.
---
Happend to me on fastnacht, people always wanted my bos jumpsuit and Forrest Camo jumpsuit 
---
I felt like that for the longest, but one by one I kept finding people willing to sell for caps and ended up getting most of the pieces I wanted.
---
Idk how the pc economy is though, honestly I would‚Äôve expected it to be much more abundant with the duped god roll items in comparison to consoles. And no matter what someone tells you, these are duped items, people wouldn‚Äôt give them up if they got them as drops.
---
So you wont bother with learning the rules of the game and cry about it when you lose. How the hell can you be this fucking entitled. 
---
Maybe you could use the time you spend complaining looking this shit up yourself.
---
Try a fucking heavy attack or any other staggering effext next time you fucking moron. 
---
No, you just don't know how to play.
---
Oof.
---
Awesome! I'll be on then
---
This. This is why I‚Äôm disappointed with survival servers. Im all for a blood bath, and I don‚Äôt care if I lose all my caps and aid to dying a ton. But let me at least get control of my character again before I‚Äôm already dead again. 
---
Sorry... had to.
---
Borderline exploiting to avoid game mechanics my dude
---
Same... Explosive weapons are the worst idea for a Fallout online, too easy kill others.
---
You have spent more time bitching on reddit about this mode today than playing it.
---
 Like really a 10 min experience and you just had to tell the internet about it 
---
Nevermind all that, scroll all the way down the album and watch that dolphin dominate that chic! LMFAO! 
---
Theres no way the perk is triggering that many times over that consistently on so many different people
---
That‚Äôs true, though at that moment, they received a lot of backlash due to it. One would‚Äôve expected something different.
---
Get legendary armor that reduces weapon or food/chems weight. Helps so much.
---
I don't get it either.  People cried out for full pvp servers, because it was "destroying adventure mode".  Now they want to complain about it?  It's a free for all chaos, wtf did you expect?  Gentlemanly duels?
---
Ok, sure. I can agree. 
---
But I also like when things are rare. Really rare. 
---
Then again, some things are rare for the wrong reason. Take the Charleston vendor (wandering responder bot). He is rare because people look for him in Charleston, were he rarely spawns. However, if you look for him at the random spawn point west down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve, he usually spawn within 5-6 server jumps. He is not rare, people just don't know where to look for him. 
---
Thanks for this post, that's a fuck tun of aid to lose to get a 20% xp boost and named legendary weapon that's already in the main game, just unnamed weapons.
---
I'd imagine everyone who is already is is just sitting at popular fast travel points waiting for people to log into the game for the first time to gank their shit.
---
*Fast travels to vault 76*
---
*Killed by level 2* 
---
Like Alt-F4?
---
ARGH. I WANTED TO PLAY TODAY, BUT THIS UPDATE HAD TO HIT RIGHT NOW?!?!?!
---
25 shots in a row? You're right
---
I had the same thought when the game came out. Who the fuck would spend real money on the atom shop?
---
Apparently, lots of people.
---
You do realize that starting on equal ground means that people who are the most successful will be the ones who get an edge down the road?  
---
This is known as being rewarded for success, rather than being rewarded for having grinded out an OP set of gear before server launch. :-p  
---
I kind of agree with your original post, Bethesda's decision may lead to more players testing initially, but it's also a recipe for disaster in the short term. If the PVP mode is simply not fun for many people they are going to leave, and the people left behind will be in this big world chasing each other's tails, which won't be fun for them either.
---
I hope it works out, but I predict this mode will fail largely because of this decision to allow OP characters in right away. Having balance at the start is a hell of a lot better than never having any balance at all!
---
Some folks just want to show off how big their "gun" is.
---
I respawned at a train station, brought up my PipBoy as soon as I could, and immediately got gunned down. Go figure. 
---
That's a deal, what platform was that on?
---
Trying to play FO76 on an Acer Switch 7, were you?
---
This answered my unspoken questions about survival mode.
---
Not going there.
---
Enjoy killing each other folks lol.
---
*psst. how do you level up &gt;fast&lt;?*
---
In my experience, so they can fast-travel to your camp and destroy it. 
---
Yeh i havent been on since it went down at midnight last night for me. So I was like this doesnt happ..ohh survival. Survival happens haha. Then i said "idiot" out loud to myself!
---
This. Over and over and over
---
What's the fastest way to level up FAST
---
are you on ps4? I have extra plans and masks.
---
Yes, please bring us your bloated inventories.  
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good idea and a good mechanic that‚Äôs why I hope they fix this loop hole. 
---
Fusion generator with arty(hope it works better now] armor, weapons, and ammo workstations. Seems to be all I need. Oh and turrets.  Lots and lots of turrets I can hide. 
---
I have a feeling people are going to get good at hiding their bases.
---
Sorry, how what works? If you mean trading then no, not at all. I genuinely found one at a vendor but my comment was more on the joking side. I actual have no idea how to work out what things are worth. I have a habit of giving things away rather than thinking about it.
---
If you say so. I thought we were having a discussion, but if you want resort to insults, feel free.
---
I agree completely. In fact we know that Ellen Santiago from the enclave came fromDC as to what weapons they have is unknown. Maybe when the rest of the enclave bunker is cleaned up we will see. 
---
I was at Whitesprings and accidentally slapped a dude in full power armor with my fireaxe, i tried to back up and holster my weapon but he immediately gunned me down and i lost half my caps (i don't usually have many)
---
I would just place as many camps as I could very far apart for cheap fast travel.
---
Your camp is now invulnerable unless you're in active combat. At least that was what they said in last issue of inside the vault. Here is a simple solution. Join, pack everything into storage, switch to survival. If not then move. Survival is not for those that want to go on adventures and make life long friends and take pretty pictures with those friends and post about how they love this community....I may have some misplaced aggression, I apologize. That is not targeted specifically at you. I don't know you and have no right to judge a stranger.
---
*Brahmin
---
They really need this even in adventure mode. You spawn in a nuke zone or are getting attacked by enemies that arent even loaded and you cant even move, on top of that my gun is always empty! No matter that it was loaded when i last quit. So now i have to wait to reload. 
---
Of all the shit people can complain about i really never expected this one. Goes to show people WILL complain about anything. 
---
Switching it in your options makes no sense. It would make you forcequit to join a new server of the other game type anyway. 
---
The endless "You can't fast travel inside of a nuke zone" would unfortunately make this a living hell if it landed on a train station. Just imagine on how long it would take to get there, too, you'd practically need to know in advance. 
---
Well, while this sub and my experiences don't accurately reflect the entire player base there seems to be an increase in "Just got the game/returning to the game" posts here.
---
And I've been helping way more new players the last few weeks that. I had previously. I am spotting them on nearly every server.
---
XBox
---
Making survival mode not force a new character roll is abysmally stupid IMO, just going to be a bunch of people with duped BIS gear and weapons pooping on everyone else. One chance to make this game fun again and they missed it. RIP.
---
The keyring feature was one of the first, once-present, missing things in FO76 that baffled me.
---
You can't even drop keys, what's the use of having them appear distinctively? Another proof of how lazy/rushed was the development of this game.
---
unless you're very comfortable with your ability to engage and win, I don't think many will choose to do any serious questing or advancing of the story in Survivor. It's basically just a big Arena map for some quick action..and that's ok, I hope it works out for those that like that sort of thing..
---
..and I'll keep looking for battered clipboards :)
---
What survival game are you playing that doesn't limit storage? 
---
Dude, if you are this new to the game I suggest you stick with adventure mode. Those survival guys will eat you alive. 
---
They might have referenced the pink image on the Slocum Joe's pipboy incorrectly. Or you might be thinking of an older data mine with the flat pink Slocum joe's image. The later might have been WIP.
---
Key word "getting there". It should have been released complete! It shouldn't be "getting there" it should BE there! The game still isn't good, and Bethesda (Sorry, "fuckwits") has done massive damage to their game and people's trust in them.
---
So someone got destroyed in Survival.
---
It could be bad because nobody would go there quickly, so if you wanted to nuke the Queen, you'd pretty much have 2-3 minutes off of time to kill her, simply because nobody can see the drop zone except the person who launched the nuke. 
---
Maybe wait to get on survival server once you‚Äôre done transferring?  
---
Dude, how the hell did you spend $400 on this game?
---
ok
---
Yea this happened to me a few times a couple days ago. I was on a server literally all day Saturday, mainly doing Frasnacht, and someone nuked near Watoga so we all went to participate. First Queen, despite me doing quite a bit of damage, ended up not providing me loot. Fudge. Well back to wandering, then someone else nukes the same area. We all go to take out the next Queen. Things are going well, but then my game starts to experience momentary pauses. Has happened before, and I know it will resume, so I leave it. This happens a number of times during the fight, sometimes lasting only 10s, sometimes over a minute. I never timed out though! Then the Queen dies and just as I get over there, my game crashes \*sigh\*
---
Happen to my level 100 character last night.  Trying to get fusion cores.  Went up to the north power plant, took over the work shop and was almost immediately contested.  Fast traveled away (hey there was 2 other unclaimed power plants and I'm willing to share).  Blocked the person who claimed the workshop.  Went to the power plant furthest  away (Posidien) and this same asshat shows up moments after I claimed this workshop.  He shot me once as I ducked for cover, then I immediately left the server.  I know this is an intended game mechanic, but this is by far the least enjoyable part of the game.
---
Or any other multiplayer survival game
---
400? How
---
They should also have a text chat. Never thought that would be a feature that one needed to request in a game like this.
---
I managed to get a furious one. Thing makes Swiss cheese of anything it comes across. I rarely even use my 50 cal anymore. But I still end up using it sparingly because I use all my ammo within a few hours of playing with it
---
Yea, I shared my first experience. That's generally an impactful one, and when the fight is so imbalanced that I deal nearly no damage and then get 1-shot, it's worth reporting. This isn't a consequence of 'whoops that happened, bad luck', it's a consequence of a decision Bethesda made that had lots of pushback against it-- letting pre-existing characters go back and forth between the modes.
---
Also, writing about experiences and leaving feedback is what forums are about. Stop being such a derpy child and go do something productive with your life. ;-)
---
Wow thanks guys!!! 
---
Yeah. I think bethesda is a bit tone deaf to their player base. 
---
Ask fortnight how much money can be made selling useless stuff in a store while giving the game away for cheap / free.
---
By some one spawn camping a station like its one thing to just lose a fight but ffs, hit him 8 times when he had no armor and it didnt even dent his health bar.
---
Also, microtransactions are no joke. 
---
Fallout shelter has made something like 98 million in revenue. 
---
It doesn't work for Survival.
---
Once I get home I'll actually tally up my loot over the entire event and give you that. I wish I had kept a fully tally of everything every 5 points of luck on Fasnacht Man, but I just kept that small amount of info I gave you before.
---
Bye Felicia
---
It's like a spawn-camp conga line.
---
Is it? I though that was intended but hadn‚Äôt been implemented yet..?
---
Not sure about apologies for misplaced aggression; I hear your points.. I‚Äôd just like to have a go at the other aspects of Survival mode but keep my CAMP intact ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Tri-centennial cosmetics you know to try to make the game playable.
---
How exactly is this bethesda's fault tho
---
I‚Äôm not bitching,it just seems like a system that wasn‚Äôt well thought out.thats all.
---
Brilliant!
---
I just wanna know how the hell a pipe wrench degrades to the point that it can't be used to smack someone with.
---
The PvP in this game has been like that since the very beginning. Does it suck? Yes. But I don't think any of us actually expected an enjoyable, balanced PvP experience from Bethesda.
---
So wait, you are shooting/hitting already dead things and finding HRF and Mass?
---
No time for bugs when there's new content and modes to add.
---
Judging only by the story he tells, the way that he writes, and the history of his posts...  Fellows, I believe it's safe to say that we have a dummy on our hands.
---
I could be wrong.
---
Doubt I will play Survival at all. Seems like all the major farm spots will become camping spots for a sniper simulator. Nice idea poor execution. Starting characters from scratch would maybe be better IMO 
---
It needs to be a solid minute of invincibility when spawning into a new game or area. The lag and inability to actually do anything cancels out whatever short timer they have.
---
They were... spawning in. The killer... knew he couldnt fight back. What is supposed to happen is that they should be given invulnerability until the game properly loads for them.
---
You literally just completely disregarded the entire issue, why did you do that? 
---
Yeah I know I commented about that already
---
I don't think this would ever happen, because I imagine a lot of the time the whole server crashes and needs a reboot, so there is no way to "go back", but they would never want to make that publicly obvious.
---
I assume you‚Äôre just perfect at the game then? 
---
I mean in ESO you could actually do something with any of the classes. Fall out it doesnt matter your play style get an automatic explosive round and it doesnt matter what level or what gear as long as you got the weapon.
---
The thing is, they deleted all the duplicates, so people only got to keep one of that item, and now people basically have 1 set of gear to use, so things are actually rare again. They did not do anything to remove caps though, and most of the dupers have 125K caps - a full account maxed out on bottlecaps. Some have 2 accounts with that. So obviously they have no need for caps. 
---
My theory whenever I see someone with a big trade list and they have a bloody explosive and bloody / fire rate of nearly every item in the game is that they get one from a trade, dupe a copy, then sell the dupe for something else until they have everything. I've never done this. I only play legit and I don't trade a ton. 
---
Honestly maybe I should just find a different game, seems like you can't keep up with the exploiters, and they weren't properly punished since they got to keep one of everything. All it really did was get rid of the people with 100,000+ of those items and screwed over the legit people. To me, the bans basically said "you can cheat a little and it's fine, you can get away with it and we condone it".
---
Why not just stick to Adventure and keep playing that?
---
Lol he probably just has dense armor and sentinel stuff...I have that stuff too and I don‚Äôt take any self dmg really from my 500 dmg rifle
---
Str should be at least 12 for:
---
Heavy Gunner 3
---
Expert heavy gunner 3
---
Master heavy gunner 3
---
bear arms 3
---
Intel 13 for the following
---
Gunsmith 5
---
Demo Expert 5 
---
Stabalized 3
---
Luck 3 for the following
---
Bloody Mess 3
---
the rest you can spread out where you want them.
---
I beat that bit the first week the game came out. 
---
I fixed my image, thanks. The flat pink one is still the image being used in the Atomic Shop right now even though the actual skin does the have the sprinkles. You're right, Bethesda most likely forgot to use the new, accurate picture (from this datamine).
---
But if advice;don‚Äôt. Power armor is currently useless in pvp, invest in strong legendary armor such as armor with the assassins or chameleon legendary effect. For heavy guns, the 50 cal is probably best. Invest in perks that boost damage and have a chance to stagger, and don‚Äôt forget damage reduction perks like blocker and fire proof.
---
He literally said he was killed as he was spawning in, it's a problem that many people are reporting. This is not something that occurs in other games, and is clearly a bug. All you guys being dicks and downvoting a serious issue? Dumbass shills. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game since beta 
---
A bit unbalanced if you ask me. I‚Äôd prolly just mule all of my aid at this point and rely on kills for food and drums if I can gain 95 off you.
---
like a menu within the menu (similar to the MISC quests)?
---
I have the Power Armor edition, I've never once used that to leverage my criticisms.  How much money you spent is on you.
---
they specifically mentioned that that wasn't going to be a problem..I'm sure the invulnerable time will get patched longer
---
World expert? I‚Äôve made over 2,000 5mm ammo but loose most of it on mothmen
---
Lol. Isn't an anti armor Fatman a misnomer? Fat man does like 5 ballistic damage. That is what your anti armor is modifying. The explosion damage is not modified if I remember correctly. Additionally, the meta pvp loadout has high resistance against fore and explosions. Thus, the Fatman does very little damage.
---
Well, unless the update is glitched in some way... the invulnerability period has been extended upon spawning, so, I didn't ignore it as much as figured the truth is slightly different than the post. Did Op start firing the second he spawned? If so. that cancels the invulnerability. 
---
Go with an instigating pipe rifle and you can double-dip on rifle and pistol perks as well.
---
Its amazing how this is a known, valid issue, but the shills continue to shill
---
Wow, I feel like a real hoarder now. I'm carrying about 20-30 weapons, armor, 200 purified water, 40 ionized meat, and around 30 fusion cores. On me. My stash is almost full of my junk. I have close to 150 bulked adhesive I've been storing. 
---
But ALL my legendary armor is geared towards weapon weight reduction. 
---
I have 2x1 shack lol
---
I don't think keys could be dropped or transferred like that. Otherwise we could do it to any world container.
---
Then why would you buy a game we‚Äôre that is literally one of the things the game is built around? 
---
That's pretty dope, of yall were on PC I might consider it just for fun
---
Am I the only one that read these with the Bud Light real men of genius music playing in the back ground?
---

---
They also need to randomize spawns
---
but the ones starting off in a month will be at the same disadvantage as someone rolling a new character today, so what's the difference?
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt even know what PVP is. The game has been a joke from the start. I‚Äôm surprised that they can even show their faces at E3 this year. üòÇ
---
The problem isn‚Äôt with quests like this. This sounds fun and has a point. 
---
The problem is gangs of assholes that surround players with chainsaws to kill them as quickly as possible with slap damage because......because?
---
Or people who jump in front of scopes. 
---
Or people who are relentless about drawing people into PvP whether they want to be there or not through any means necessary, including exploits. 
---
If less people had been dicks, removing slap damage wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. Blame the people that abused it in the name of ‚Äúbeing raiders.‚Äù 
---
Some people *were* raiders. Encountered them. Was fun, even when I died. 
---
A lot of people were just dicks.
---
Elektrisko has been killed. 
---
She gets +55k hp per player as far as i know
---
They 100 percent don‚Äôt want to do that considering how they nuke nerf every farming location once in a while
---
But who watches the watchmen ?
---
I'd say 20sec would be about enough time to run around a cornor should someone be camping the spawn with range.
---
Ya I need to start looking into this. I only use power armor. Which I think is another mistake. 
---
Gary? **Garry!**
---
No I died before I fully loaded in
---
I keep having people set me to ignore after they kill me. It‚Äôs infuriating. 
---
Levels and perks and mods and mutations make that an impossible to answer question.
---
Is it giving you the option to "find another world?"
---
You there?
---
Yup, dense and fireproof voids explosives for sure.  Spawn camping, while sucky, is nothing new for online video games in general.  Fallout 76 isn't going to re invent the wheel.
---
I just wanted the owl mask. Then I received it nearly every time. I have ten now..lol
---
Remember. Be careful what you wish for.
---
I eat one everyday. There's a spot in the world where one spawns.
---
you mean you keep spawning in the same spot? (sorry haven't tried it yet)
---
What platform are u? 
---
I agree it should have been good at launch, but you at least have to try it. There is not a single game that has been complete on launch in the last like 2 years. Almost every game comes out and needs a lot of work. That's just the industry now. It sucks, but that's how it is. Anthem was released in an even worse state
---
Then stash all your fucking meds, junk and caps? Or just accept that you'll lose stuff and stop crying.
---
I think the time limit of availability and rarity of the items made the event continuously populated. This is also an argument to keep those ~~impossible~~ rare items rare.
---
Great question, I've been wondering also. I've scrapped many of them and never learned any.
---
You still need to level and progress the story? I mean sure I could walk to WS, assuming I make it past the higher level Ghouls, I'm still low level? You can't just hide forever at WS, eventually you're gonna ya know want to play game. The cherry on top is, the various robots at WS honestly dont do nearly enough damage to kill a lvl 100+ player in full PA. They could gun you down, and even if they aggro the npc's, they can just sprint out there with no repercussions from the WS "staff". Being listed on the map just for, living, is stupid.
---
Are you guys planning on hiring maybe down the line? A PMC sounds really suitable for the story of my new main character, if not its totally fine but i thought i should go ahead and ask :P
---
At least at that location yes. So not only do they know where to camp to kill me they kill me before I can even move 
---
Still waiting for those lunch boxes...
---
They didn‚Äôt delete all of the duplicates. And I know people are still duping because I‚Äôve seen a duper with 6 three starred hunting rifles, all stacked, hunting rifles came out after duping was supposedly patched.
---
Dense and Fireproof say hi
---
Lol my friends and i didn‚Äôt realize it was repeatable and figured they came out during the heart of the swamp event (we have all done the quest you mentioned) 
---
Eh, there's no issue with how they are doing this, but I do wish they'd call it PvP Mode or some such and give us a third mode for true Survival like what is suggested in the OPs post. 
---
What about having characters duplicated in both servers on transfer and not allow swapping back and forth after that maybe? That is a solution I haven't seen suggested yet, what are people's thoughts on something like that?
---
im sure the ones who think it is awesome are spawn camping everyone else, even though they loaded in first thing after servers went live, so they never got spawn camped themselves
---
Conan Exiles does not have a stash limit.
---
Alright, I'll give that one to you. And hey, maybe it is a good game. Just after all I've heard, I have no trust in it anymore.
---
I never get the spawn. I'm holding this one close. Hopefully display soon
---
Kinda sounds similar to players claiming a workshop and being one shot without warning.
---
You did read that joining survival mode opened you up to PvP, didn't you? 
---
Then I'd say it was a full on glitch.
---
The latest changes are supposed to prevent that.
---
Am I the only one that remembers when Elder Scrolls and Fallout was about immersion? Now it is seems to be more about fast paced Fortnite style action. "Swooosh"
---
I‚Äôve had a rough few months trying to convince my friends to buy the game to play with me, all I got was instant complaints about how bad it was and how it was one of the worst games ever and when I questioned them on why it was so bad they didn‚Äôt actually have a proper answer.
---
Just goes to show the influence the media platforms and popular figures in the gaming world have on people and they don‚Äôt think to try the game out themselves or, if they don‚Äôt want to/can‚Äôt afford it, just leave their opinion in a neutral stance.
---
I‚Äôll always love a fallout game because... well it‚Äôs fallout, the foundations of this game are what I fell in love with all that time ago and as long as I can continue playing a game that feels like fallout, I‚Äôm happy.
---
Are you including the home defense perk and those heavy turrets?
---
Nah man, PC. Thanks for the offer tho.
---
pvp isn't disabled until lvl 5 in survival?
---
Well, I'm trading some fusion cores if you need some!
---
I‚Äôd welcome some more spooky extraterrestrials, especially if they and Vault 51 are related to the crashes space station!
---
Still doesn‚Äôt fix the enemy scaling? I would play it, but sucks to have to deal with a level 60 enemy when I‚Äôm level 12, JUST because there  is a level 80 player nearby. I literally can‚Äôt play the game because of that.. imean you guys do have an elder scrolls counterpart. Don‚Äôt know why this is so hard
---
Dense and Fireproof can see my ass in court :)
---
257 stimpacks, 2500 caps, 100 stimpacks, 150 radaways within 5 minutes. Thanks to people like you who do not read the notes and brings everything they have into survival. Thanks for the meds!
---
If you never wanted the higher risk, then don't enter survival? Stick to your care bear adventure servers?
---
Jus remake it so they have to make a new character. Or give player safety for like an hour or two
---
What did this area look like in a prior build??
---
I like really rare as well. And I'd be absolutely ok with these drop rates if this event was more like a daily and all year round. That's my biggest complaint besides the false advertising. 
---
There are plenty of really rare things in game now and no ones ever complained because you know, eventually, with time, you can get it  
---
I have 33 fusion cores üòÇ 
---
Dense and fireproof voids explosives.
---
I was actually looking forward to starting a new survival character, but that of course would be foolish.
---
Yeah I had 130 died once and it dropped 52, I got them back though. Then I died again and it dropped 70, got them back again, then I died a third time and it dropped 120, seems just a tad bit ridiculous it drops anywhere from50-90% of the items randomly I would say 50% of the stack Max is fair but 90% is ridiculous 
---
This is Bethesda. You really think when they said "random" in a patch note, that they meant "random with some generous RNG attached"? When they said random in the patch notes, I took that to exactly mean RANDOM. You could lose 1 Aid item, you could lose all your Aid items.
---
If they made stashes raidedable no one would ever build a camp. Defenses in this game are a joke
---
Go take your fury out on a tree.
---
Because fuck trees. Invincible pieces of shit.
---
500 bullets I wasted. It still there. Mocking me. Can't build base on tree, maybe build tree house? No support. 
---
Fuck tree. 
---
0/10. Immersion ruined.
---
Side note, I hope this was more entertaining than op. Because I felt like my time was wasted, but must commit to some good. Have a nice day y'all. 
---
Go play "Adventure" mode
---
He provided enough details. It would appear that the update is glitched in some way, this is not the only person reporting this. It makes perfect sense, it is something that can happen with this sort of game.
---
Op didnt say ANYTHING about firing or return fire, you just made that up and are speculating for no reason, because youre literally just trying to "put him in his place" and not hear out his TOTALLY VALID ISSUE. Its ridiculous how flippant you and some people on the subreddit are being.
---
"But I don't wanna be a waider anymore, where's my slap damage, waaahhhh, waahhhh!"
---
Dev room was accessible on every platform. 
---
The short answer is no, they won‚Äôt be sold, and if they are sold, they‚Äôre going to be from the dev room, and worth a stupid amount of money or a ridiculous trade. It‚Äôs survival of the best exploiter in this game.
---
Does the LMG benefit from heavy guns??
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
Also you don‚Äôt need these full sets of gear to be effective. I end 90% of my pvp encounters without them even having a clue where I am. Just like any PvP game, your strategy and getting the jump on someone are your biggest guns.
---
I used to blow myself up with tse in one shot.  Both of those brought it down to null.
---
I made it to level 5 and died as did a few others trying to do the responder missions. Once dead, You're basically fucked.
---
Even the one minute invincibility does SHIT. I tried to run. They just chased me till it ran out raining explosives.
---
You're not wrong lol.
---
Ark, rust, minecraft, etc. Name me one survival pvp game that has a stash limit besides 76
---
I was disappointed in this weapon when I tried it prior to the buff, guess I'm gonna have to dust off my build for heavy weapons again so I can try it out in all its glory. Overall, nice to see heavy weapons getting some attention.
---
Many of my ‚Äò90% weight reduced‚Äô Legendaries are still heavy as fack. Math is just not Bethesda‚Äô thing I guess. 
---
My suggestions on how to fix this:
---
1. After spawning, you STAY invulnerable for 2 minutes AND if you don't move or shoot.
---
2. While invulnerable, you can't shoot others but others can't shoot you; this should fix spawn-camping right then and there.
---
3. As soon as you move, you are vulnerable again.
---
In short, this gives you a chance to see if "the coast is clear" before moving out of a spawn point.
---
I think it's a bug.  There is suppose to be extra invincibility time but if you see someone loading you can just walk up to the them kill them before they have control of the character.
---
Ok...1, got anymore? 
---
Yup, overlooked.
---
yeah, i can still stand in full view of a missle launcher and tank hits
---
I'm sure there is but we need to know what platform ur on
---
GFY. I have explained myself to OP. You? Deserve no such response.
---
I am not putting anyone "in their place". Nor am I attempting to. 
---
+20% Xp. I wanted to level up a new character to have other options. Did not expect to have a team of no lifes hunting around the new spawn looking for new accounts to kill then keep locked down to V76
---
You're able to tame creatures and have them defend your camp...
---
Awesome. As a solo-only player who just wants to play Fallout and engage in the lore, Adventure Mode is much appreciated.
---
Oh wow ok
---
Im PS4, sorry! 
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
I feel like Quad would *almost* be bad for this weapon, if only because you'd be able to blow through huge amounts of ammo without even thinking about it.
---
Duping ended and the perpetrators were suspended for a while. You‚Äôre talking like they can still do this and it‚Äôs obfuscating the point. 
---
That does not cover the territory of killing someone while they load in, use your common sense. This is literally something that you see patched out constantly in other titles; overwatch comes to mind instantly.
---
Yeah Beth fucked up again... no surprise. Don't worry though. "Its working how it's supposed to" I'm sure
---
Dumbass, those all have storage space. Ultima Online, ALL the Diablos, PoE, Ark, Rust, Minecraft.
---
Tea baggers proud of one shoting?
---
Ok, so it finally let me login after about six weeks. Just had an update today. (march-26-19) and I'm back to getting error code. That's it F*CK Bethesda I'm out!
---
‚ÄúBroken‚Äù ‚Äú Unplayable‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm god tier but can‚Äôt kill anyone‚Äù ‚Äú muh caps‚Äù‚Äùmuh aid‚Äù 
---
Add me on titchzx45 :)
---
what?
---
Yeah, it doesn't really feel like a "survival" mode.  Just a pvp mode really. 
---
I just remembered why I left this sub...
---
Nah survival mode is a mode for pvp cheaters,duper‚Äôs and hackers to finally get caught hence the leaderboard haha they literally show themselves to Bethesda for banning
---
Why cant pvp be more about blood and glory versus caps and junk? Wouldn't people enjoy it more if you didn't have to worry about losing all ur shit?
---
Should‚Äôve been better at the game 
---
I'd say if you can get it for like $30 or less then give it a try. Or you could even wait until later this year when the Wastelanders DLC comes out because people speculate that will add human NPCs and it is confirmed to add dialogue options.
---
(Also every DLC is free which is nice)
---
That was the first thing I thought of
---
Ohhh baby, that sweet sweet FS knife....
---
Just riffing off your comment
---
It's turning Survival into deathmatch with leaderboards. What the hell is Bethesda thinking. 
---
nope as far as i know
---
Maybe the system doesnt want you to steal every item every time you kill someone. 
---
Just start poking through the bags and take what you need. It's a tad less soul crushing for them and you dont waddle around the map.
---
Same lol
---
It's almost as if there is a mode with just about everything the OP wants
---
Your post hurts me to read. Just find a way, there is always a way. Holy smokes people are always so quick to complain. 
---
If I do that, what will I have to complain about in my survival mode sucks post?
---
Get travelling pharmacy perk for chems, bandolier for ammo and batteries included if you carry fusion cores and carry it all instead of stashing it
---
Yes but the point is the mode does SUCK BALLS, I too did think the mode would be way better logged and didn't fall prey to exploit at least that I know of but did get one shot so fast that I could not even tell by whom what or where it came from. Which I am sure that is so fun for some but makes no fun nor sense to me... I am in PA they are not... I am a level 60 something they are level 200 something again I guess this makes sense and fun to some but is WTF to me... the whole fact "that in game we are all from the same VAULT and would have grown up with each other and the Overseer PLEADS with us to work with each other and we see what happen here when the last people didn't WHY IN THE HELL would we be Killing each other now is laughable at best but sure... look at the real world is ripe with nuts so it works...
---
Like... why...
---
Go to the farmers north of the vault,  hop a bit
---
It sort of is though. Who‚Äôs gonna log in to harvest razorgrain?  It‚Äôs more of a place for pvp-focused players to find a server full of ppl who actually engage. I don‚Äôt really pvp much, but i play with ppl who mostly pvp and they get frustrated when ‚Äòno one wants to play‚Äô on the server- I think this is aimed at those players. And then trade/farm/whatever on regular adventure servers
---
As much as I find your situation to be pretty unreasonable, I find the mental imagery of a level 100 in power armor launching nukes at newbies utterly hilarious. I be he's having a blast. 
---
It has muzzle brake, and prime receiver.  That's it.
---
OR GARY
---
That's the only survival game I've played recently, there may be others that have no stash limit.
---
Spawn camping needs to be fixed for sure
---
Miss runescape, I made a ton of in game money farming and selling lobsters by the 100's lol
---
Why do people keep try to get him to spawn at Charleston when it is so much faster and easier to get him to spawn west down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve? Nobody ever build there and there don't seem to be as many possible events in the points random list since it is so much quicker and to get him to spawn there.
---
Gary. GARY GARY GARY! Gary, Gary Gary Gary Gary.
---
Gary.
---
Try and find some ways around the system bud. You will eventually get yourself out of there build your camp where you think can be hidden from other players and play the survival mode. 
---
Just have fun with it. 
---
Ur good. Didn't mean to lash out at you. It's just very frustrating. I expect the survival servers will be empty by the end of the day
---
Plus the argument that no lifers will be OP in a few weeks isn't all that compelling to me.  Those players are always going to be ahead of the majority of us who can't (or moreover don't care to) devote 10 hours a day to fallout.  But those people are at end of the bell curve and most of the rest of us are in the middle, and it would have been nice to balance out most people starting off.  
---
Grenades, mines, Tesla shotgun, berry mentats are all counters to stealthboys.
---
High rof weapon with a stagger perk, vats crit headshot, grenades, mines, melee are all counters to sentinel users. 
---
Oh I dont, I just take the stuff I use on a regular basis. 
---
51 Hmmmm. Does it have a WP now too? Like the other vaults or no.
---
Thanks, I suppose the muzzle break slightly reduces range by 8 or 10 but adds stability?
---
We full right now I tell you if a opportunity arises
---
Does it include the black Camo that was data mined?
---
I like it the way it is. People who come in unprepared then cry on reddit. Just bring in 20 of each aid and be prepared to lose them. And if you do, it doesn't hurt. Because when you kill someone, you get more back
---
Lol I got pissed when it happened to me but I mean now it‚Äôll just make going back to adventure mode more challenging now that I don‚Äôt have a 130 stack of stimpacks
---
Careful you don't get a friction burn from jerkin yourself off.
---
Agreed but on a different level. Obsessing over stats is hypermiling. Sure some find it fun, but is it really worth it? Do we need to break down a video game and fun, items with no statistical advantage,to numbers and stats? Is this just addiction manifesting in a slow creep??
---
I would be super into this.  I like starting fresh, and having a reason to do so.  
---
That you were standing still and got headshot?
---
Very true, the game turned rifles into point and shoot cameras, you don‚Äôt need aim or reflex just let the camera do its thing and pew pew ‚Äòcriticals‚Äô, mom they dead üòÇ
---
My CAMP is elaborate, but built to look lived in. I actually **LOVE** The aesthetic of the place after someone has fought their way to the "stronghold" part of it in the cave. I have a 1X2 stairway connecting the top and bottom of a cliff (7 stories) that looks badass all burnt out with damaged walls. There's 1 way into the cave and when I (or anyone else) goes through the cluttered, bone charm filled entrance they lag and aggro all 9 turrets I have set there. 
---
Or who never play video games with the sound on.  :/
---
No problem, I hope this gets changed
---
I don‚Äôt like the top three showing up. Also why double the caps? At lvl 286, I‚Äôm loosing over 500 caps per death so I am not spending as much time in survival as I would like to. 
---
This reminds me of the douchebag who tried to blow up the cars in the parking lot the other day.
---
I followed him to the golf club 5 minutes later and snuck in through the back and killed a 3* legendary that spawned for him while he was upstairs........ LOL.
---
Tried for maybe 2 hours there? Zip nada
---
I still agree that all people should start off as new in survival, and that pvp should be prevented until either level ten, or have 10-24 hour safe period after getting a new character in survival. After that, let anarchy happen.
---
Fun would be them forcing all new restarts. Since all duped//Purchased gear still exists on these accounts.
---
Who the fuck just happens to have 100+ mini nukes to toss away for giggles? 
---
Yeah it's kinda bad, surprised there has not been an emergency hot fix really.
---
Ha!  Saw a post from someone bragging about getting their 100th pppie.  Hope it was them you killed.
---
I'll be fine, thanks though :) still super funny to me. Told a troll awhile back that I'd be laughing when it came out and everyone started bitching. So, this is me, laughing, cause I think it's funny
---
Oh right, good thinking.  There's always something to bitch about if you put your mind to it.  The more you know!
---
I love it when people don't read the patch notes.
---
Crying that they lost x aid x caps, it's in the damn patch notes. If they can't take losing them, go back to care bear adventure mode.
---
Fallout NV also had a keyring. I don't believe Fallout 4 did though.
---
well it makes sense teat they're excavator since that's the one set I don't need to  mod out right now  (LOL)
---
But you loose all your junk when you die. It‚Äôs the same thing 
---
I would say I'd buy them
---
But unfortunately Survival mode kicked my ass and stole all my lunch money.
---
My question is, what's the point of sneak and perception if people are hidden on the map unless top 3?
---
I would have hoped this mode was like you describe, but without the top 3 garbage and just stay hidden if you sneak. 
---
Wait what‚Äôs happening?
---
Gave it a try today.  Looked like some action happening at a train station so I thought I‚Äôd go engage.  Within seconds of spawning was basically 2-3 shotted.  Never had a chance.  Watched another spawn in same spot while I was dead.  Same thing to that person.  Apparently the invincibility timer doesn‚Äôt apply in this situation or it‚Äôs broken.  Regardless, first experience is pretty much as expected.  Stupid freaking devs.
---
Unless you kill somebody before you die first....
---
Cool. And with it coming to steam I'll be able to get it really cheap
---
Anyone else notice a drop in Camp budget? 
---
I'm wondering if this will die down eventually.  Right now everyone is just shooting at first sight.  When the novelty wears off, maybe people will treat it a little different.
---
Yeah, haha. Brainfarts are dumb
---
Unfortunately no, there's no waypoint
---
Thinking like a wasteland millionaire.  I like it.
---
I think how they have it is fine basically. Everyone has the same opportunity to level up, if they want, in relative safety in Adventure mode. Then when they feel ready, hop over to the other mode.
---
 I'd suggest, minus the duping, that new players have an easier path to growing now, now that griefing has been removed from Adventure..as long as you understand the workshop rules..
---
Won't be a surprise. Due to Whitsprings and Prime being the only viable options you won't be shocked to hear the Alarm.
---
But nice idea
---
Still no bos combat armor plans in sight . 
---
But neither does a lvl 10-15. It should be raised to 50! Wait no! Lvl 50's can't compete with lvl 100's!
---
oh good, so it is a firing squad simulator? sounds fun and engaging and i am sure it will "just work".
---
Anyone who played the fasnacht event, was easy to walk away with a dozen each run.
---
yes it does.
---
Wait there's a limit? Haven't taken that many yet but that does kinda bum me out.
---
I heard people are camping vault 76 to kill low levels
---
One of the most brutal things is crafting now. You‚Äôve really gotta make sure you are in a safe spot to craft or else you are free food. Walked up to some poor soul and beat the brakes off him while he was cooking some food lol. 
---
YES THANK YOU. I already decided awhile back that I wouldn't be playing in survival mode cause I read what they said it would be like, and I wasn't a fan, so I opted to not ever play it. It's highly amusing watching so many people cry about it. Like come on, did they really not read anything Bethesda posted?!
---
Count me in!
---
Just give us a solid 40-60 seconds of movement while being invincible unless we attack.   Spawn camping should of been addressed but we have worse devs ever.
---
Ya got me... it's an incredibly old bug (dating back to FO4) so I have no clue why it became necessary to "fix"... especially given how wonky base building already can be. If you want to go bonkers and make a cement cube or the like, go nuts...
---
Thing is, guys that think they won‚Äôt die don‚Äôt offload their caps.
---
It‚Äôs always the morons that know they are gonna die, and that‚Äôs because they will and do end up dying. 
---
I see what youre saying, but ultimately the only solution i see working is rebalance, which theyre already attempting
---
Paper isn‚Äôt practice. Reports confirm that Sneak Crit builds are less effective but melee is unchanged.
---
Im not gonna explain the game mechanics for you. Youve never had to figure out anything for yourself and thats why you run in to these seemingly unpassable obstacles. Time to start thinking stupid.
---

It‚Äôs not my photo (I couldn‚Äôt get mine to work): but here‚Äôs how it looks
---
Carry nothing but salt.
---
&gt;Lady Janets Soft Serve
---
What's the spawn initiating point? For example: in Charleston it's crossing the red bridge towards the RR station.
---
That's also another issue. No more slap damage but they can still blow up cars to kill you and they don't even get wanted. That should get you wanted.
---
Didn't think I would be spawn killed without a chance to fight
---
Oh, dude. I'll happily peel a few layers off for this. I'm with OP, 100%... I've debated with SO MANY players, swinging dick and acting like King Shit of Turd Island, while they tell PvE players to suck it up, and how "there are wolves, and there are sheep".
---
So yeah, I'll rub it raw for a while, as they bitch about being killed and losing their stuff.
---
I am hoping they do something to negate spawn camping. Just ran into it and after dying 4 times I am over that! I spawned in and was killed before I could even move. 
---
I've actually thought about this too.  It would be nice if we could have a primary camp, and we can also have an "FOB" of sorts that has about 25% of the budget of a primary camp, and can be used for when you want to mine specific resources or to have a better fast-travel network.
---
Same here. I‚Äôm on Xbox 1.
---
Bethesda will tweak it some, make it easier to get onto the map without being engaged immediately, and yes, it'll evolve into something different..
---
That‚Äôs just not okay
---
It better be there!  That‚Äôs the primary reason I bought that bundle.  
---
I enjoyed it. Participated in about 6 of them, no issues.
---
That only works for the pipe revolver rifle which you cannot obtain as a legendary. And the fact that you can not obtain it as a legendary makes the whole point he is trying to make moot, because it will never be better than a full specced out legendary weapon.
---
that was funny too!  +1
---
Yep. Network speed, ping, and comp power are making the immunity timer inadequate.
---
Fucking awesome! -firing squad simulator!
---
I see you have a BOS flair, I run around in BOS T60 and BOS Combat Armor. Lvl 211. Want to play together sometime? I run a heavy weapons build
---
This same thread will exist with people complaining that they aren't getting the Uber rare mask. 
---
The pvp is actually broken though. One shotting people isn‚Äôt pvp, that‚Äôs just stupid.
---
Survival should require a brand new character and you are fair game once you leave the vault or at the least have a safe zone around 76 or even make the entire forest a no kill zone. Though if they did this survival mode would probably be dead but it sounds like a griefers paradise now but youre literally rewarded for longest killstreak so what do we expect.
---
&gt;saw this at about 245am EST.  they just appeared and started tumbling down the hill.
---
Very nice, congratulations and welcome to the 3 digit club.
---
Yep, me too.
---
Preparation-H, anyone?
---
Does the leaderboard mark your camp?
---
If so, It‚Äôs a stash and two benches for me.
---
No but it is a half floor which would need to be shot out from underwater, which you cannot do. I place/remove the floor while underwater in the build menu. Other than doing that, it cannot be removed which means you cannot swim in.
---
I went on a photography spree where I wanted to capture a bunch of specific things, and realized quickly I‚Äôd have to delete my ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù pictures to make room for this new collection I was attempting. A big bummer for sure! 
---
For sure, I'm not so much currently wearing BOS stuff but I'm slowly switching to heavy weapons from two handed melee, I'm down, I'm lvl 90 haha
---
Well, it IS a Beta.
---
Thank you, did you grab several ? Do you know how is it possible to drop something on the ground without paper bag ?
---
I have this very same stats in assault rifle flavor. One day I'll make a junkies build just for it.
---
- Locked Survival characters
---
- No stash carried over, player starts with nothing
---
- Server Matchmaking based on player level 1- 25, 26 - 50, 51 - 75, 76 - 100, 100+
---
There is my constructive feedback
---
I like that idea, after 20 killstreak with just a AA lever, it was no fun anymore. They even said that one shot couldnt onehit anymore, well, we can 
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
Yeah. I was too young. I unfortunately don't really have the time or money to go to estate sales but maybe someday in the future 
---
I don't need you to. He spent over 25k on the armour. 
---
Or even have a percentage chart. If we knew the drop rate of different items it would make more sense. Most mobile games can manage it, ya know?
---
Maybe I will phrase it different, what‚Äôs the highest damage output build?
---
Relax buddy its called a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù for a reason. I DO NOT LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE
---
Definitely, I think either way battling with normal weapons would actually be more fun (especially black powder weapons)
---
That‚Äôs a dick move
---
Not of you add it to your quick select, much faster
---
I spent over 100k on mine.
---
Yup, Gauss Rifle Sniper here. Got my ass handed to me by someone who shot me twice with a handmade. Welp. It's fun but extremely unbalanced. Also, I killed a bunch of low levels (lvls 35-80) and got almost no caps for it. But then I get killed twice by the same dude and end up losing 600 caps....
---
I have that covered
---
Thats.... a poor excuse!
---
I am only seeing owned items in the atom shop. 
---
After I logged in it happened to me as well, followed by massive lag, more so than on adventure mode
---
I've heard that too but never tested myself.
---
never said it was, just making a joke
---
If we remove the dropping of junk, then there is no reason we should ever need to die, because game-death has no consequences any more. No, dropped junk needs to stay, no matter how annoying it can be at times.
---
Welcome to the wastelands!
---
(It doesn't help that Bethesda just floaded the market with thousands of free mini-nukes)
---
Lmaoooo upvoted
---
yessir
---
Stuck in hospital atm so missed out on this. Gutted.
---
didn't even think about that, well now I'm never going on those servers on my main, which sucks cos I am currently respeccing and the extra 20% was looking pretty good...
---
There‚Äôs a limit? I could swear I‚Äôve taken far more than 50 photos...
---
No. I don‚Äôt want to play the board game again...
---
No more boards...
---
All I see is boards...
---
AAAAH!!!!
---
If it makes you feel better, no one got the sunny mask üòÇ
---
True but on a brand new character won't have access to fireproof until level 27 unlocks. A new player probably won't be able to get a full set of armor with dense mods either. 
---
I like you guys! Didn‚Äôt you hunted people to give to!
---
........new......character........lvl........5
---
I love it hahaha
---
not only should you be forced to start a new character but there should be no legendary weapons or armor allowed. Also the weapon dmg should be the same for the lvl 5 as the lvl 50 and perk cards can't change it.
---
Personally I find it absurd that they can camp new accounts so easily per my post.
---
With no fast travel you're forced to V76 basically with a new account. If they catch you near V76 without a camp all you can do is world hop until you get to a non spawn camped world
---
 I accidentally shot at a few people at an event before I was told about "pacifist" mode...
---
I mean, if you can't one-shot with Black Powder Rifle, the weapon is basically useless... as by the time it does its ridiculously long reload, the other guy's stimpak has basically healed the whole damage. 
---
That said, if you CAN one-shot with the Black Powder Rifle, that's lame and stupid too. 
---
I don't envy Bethesda's job trying to balance this mess. lol. 
---
I'm going to go ahead and say that if you don't factor in the community presence in an opinion of an online game/service, you are not judging a game based on it's full merits/flaws. 
---
Did we just become friends?
---
There is an easy way to check. Just have someone shoot at it. And my misplaced feelings are towards specific people who you share maybe one thing in common with so trip certainly misplaced.
---
Yeah I got that impression, so weird that half the masks seemed impossible to get!
---
Well, the "Damage Cap" ISN'T beta, it's in Adventure mode PVP right now.
---
Lots of them wanted to grief PVE plyers under the guise of being a "raider". They don't want consequences.
---
Need 2 survival modes...one as is...and a second one that you create your new character in and it can never leave...you let players play both and see which is preferred.
---
I will now!
---
Everyone has free mini-nukes. Fasnatch made sure of that. I was trading bullets for mini-nukes all week. I got 50+ right now just to play around with my TS fatman. The only reason I don't have more is those bitches weigh a ton.
---
lost 670 in 30 sec. fuk me
---
I feel your pain...
---
True, dense is a chest piece mod
---
Lol. I remember memorizing the spawns and running between them with a Kar98k. 
---
Good times, if it was done right.
---
Same thing with the train stations excep easier. Live a while, camp chameleon at a train station, and profit.
---
I actually wish nuclear strikes were less up-front.  There **should** be a sense of dread whenever somebody launches one, and I'm thinking the blast radius should only be confirmed on the last minute instead of immediately.
---
A beta that is a few hours old .... .
---
Nope ? Yeah you do. I bought it and have camo for combat/leather/metal plus weapon skins 
---
They treated Fo76 as a solo game and completely missed the boat. I would have totally bought skins for my first pipe gun, then as I leveled up my revolver, my 10mm, my shotty, I would have kept dressing up the tools my character rely on for survival. But nope nada nothing, five months later and we got one wood skin for a lever action. By now at level 300+ I simply don‚Äôt care any more. All of my weapons are legendaries, the look makes no difference whatsoever and no more desire to personalize them. When survival becomes easy there‚Äôs little attachment to the tools. 
---
That's what it looks like. Such a shame. Anyways congrats. If you're on Xbox I have spares plans. 
---
I got 257 super stims from one guy in a excavator armor. I love it when people don't read patch notes. I only brought 20 of each aid and 1000 caps with me, ready to lose everything. Came out with way more than I wanted to.
---
Proof people will bitch about anything 
---
Oh I hadn't even thought about that... well, all the more reason to start a new character rather than bounce back and forth.
---
Then get dense mod or die?
---
Oh right, then yes. It's actually a good idea to check vendors, particularly at Whitespring and Watoga, as players will sell all their unwanted lengendary stuff there. One person's junk.is another's treasure. You'll normally just find 1 star stuff but occasionally you get 2 or 3 star stuff if it's not a popular effect or weapon type. Got a few nice energy weapons and pistols that way.
---
That is a lot but what are the percentages here? Is that all, half, a tenth of what you were carrying?
---
Finally a developer that keeps rare items rare.  As it should be.
---
Yes it is. That's why I dont accept friend requests from Strangers when I have a workshop. I assume people are hunting for me.
---
Created a new character and brought it in to Survival. What a nightmare. Level 150+ just roaming around in Flatwoods 1-shooting new players. 
---
Would have liked this more if it was truly about survival. Create a new character, see how long they can last. Keep servers in level ranges (new to 20, 20-40, so on). If you die. You start over again. 
---
It's just not interesting to have players with high level - absurd loadouts coming in and destroying with their duped items. 
---
Did they fix the American Hero and Fallout Forever trophies/achievements? 
---
I've been screenshotting my faves and uploading them, just to make sure I have room for when Mothman stays for more like .8 seconds
---
I'm a heavy RP guy even playing solo. I like having motivations, and a place in the wasteland. I like giving my character depth, it makes every quest/decision/camp/encounter that much more interesting.
---
What‚Äôs that thing..? Wanting all the reward and no risk?
---
yeah the kid hides in the pulovsky when you go to find out what happened with his dad (replayed a month ago xd)
---
Dont force me to make a level 65 alt, I'm okay with my current loss of 450 caps per death and I don't need to lower that so I could enter any area...
---
That does it, I'm only buying a fridge with a spall liner now
---
exp is pointless when your lvl 250 like me tho..i wouldnt care if i didnt recieve any exp from anything..got about 50 lvl ups to spend...i guess the only reason someone over lvl 150 or so would need exp is to respec.
---
Do events. If you're looking for top level gear stick to the mire and cranberry bog. Events have a higher chance to spawn legendaries than the general world, I've found.
---
Forget about uranium fever and go for AWOL Armaments, hoard events (look for super mutant and Mr handy hoards, they tend to be higher level) Monster Mash and (I'm being entirely serious) Irrational fear. I get three star honeybeasts pretty regularly doing that one.
---
If the loot generator is a casino, whitesprings and watoga would be the slot machines. You want to skip that shit and go for the blackjack tables of loot generation, hunting 3 stars.
---
ahh but before I would just attack the person looking at my bag. Now what am I supposed to do???
---
LOL. Dude, good for you, I actually think that's awesome
---
Skyrim SE has bugs that existed in the first release in 2011, and SE still receives continual content updates (Creation Clib paid mods) to this day. Just wait until mods are released for fo76, the modders will get to work on those bugs. 
---
Forcing people to make new characters in survival don't solve anything at all. It solves the problem for today and maybe for a few days, then a week down the road a lvl 30 with lvl 30 stuff is waiting for newbies and we are at the same problem, just on a lower scale.
---
What we need it that the servers place people that are at roughly in same level bracket together. Lvl 1-5 ends up on one server farm, lvl 6-10 one another server farm, 11-15 on yet another and so on, lvl 70+ can all go to the same servers because at that point levels don't means squat. 
---
youtuber tested this and no, you still die from the blast
---
Nah. It's survival mode. Survive.
---
My only critique on the mode is no Survival Locked character creation. I wanna level from 1+ on a Survival server with only other characters doing the same thing. 
---
As it always seems to happen, the next time I played after writing that comment I had a HUGE amount of help from a few random dudes.  For hours.  And met a nice guy at the same level as me to do quests. 
---
alright, I see your point... i think what im really saying is there isn't much of an easy solution or alternative that wouldnt cause more problems. Maybe just make it so you cant collect bounties from someone who's been on your friends list in the past few hours? This would also help prevent murder while trading
---
said this from day one of announcement ... so stupid you can go over fully geared and leveled.
---
Only way to make PVP mode semi balanced would be a clean slate for every one that steps into it.
---
I've played since the beta and have never seen it. Any hints as to where I could run into it? The forest I presume?
---
That‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôll get on around 7 CST to do some challenges and run some events with you
---
They choose to start over. Most people wouldnt, but yeah, its not cool
---
This post illustrates exactly why you shouldn't be able to mix survival and adventure. It totally makes resource building in survival pointless.
---
Here are some points:
---
1. You don't have to carry junk with you all the time, but you need stimpacks, food etc. to function properly so you can't just leave it in stash 
---
2. Junk (broken down) weight the same in your inventory and in stash, aid items weight 10 times more in stash when you have certain cards, which means you can't just dump 100s of stimpacks, canned dog food, water, radaway, whatever into stash. Stash is pretty small.
---
3. Junk in general is less valuable.
---
Well, the reality is that the majority of players aren‚Äôt like you and are under 150. So maybe it does matter. 
---
Like? ARE YOU FIVE YRS OLD?
---
If you have a username if anyone still in the world you can return. Check your recent players and you should be able to get back. 
---
only 1 for myself, call it selfishness.  no idea.
---
For me it is always at 8pm est no mater what time I finish the quest.
---
Well that's not good. Dont understand how a .308 had more damage then a .50 cal. 
---
I'm PST and have plans at 630 or so but afterwards I'll most likely be on, it's my great aunts 100th bday today lol
---
I completely agree that we should start with new characters. It would ensure that ur not rolled by players that got to the top by dupping
---
I hope they have more events like this. I had a great time with it, even as a fresh level 7. 
---
Yeah, why not? If I drop in a brown paper bag, then it's lost forever. At least this way I know it's going to help someone.
---
But getting one of those rare masks ***is a participation ribbon.***   Those who got them did so simply because they showed up to do the event.   Not because they were better players. 
---
I've been there on three occasions, once to visit (Snowshoe) , the others while passing through to go to other states.  I can confirm it is quite lovely and very cozy.
---
Google "fallout 76 interactive map" open categories and uncheck all. Then scroll and toggle what's important to you. Junk piles are great.
---
Is there a way to see the leaders yet? lol
---
Agreed. Maybe a timer so you can‚Äôt trade with a player you killed for a few hours. I‚Äôm also not sure why 50% is taken off your bounty. 
---
It seems half of the comment section didn‚Äôt pass the intelligence check for this post lmao.
---
100% agree op, but there are a ton of things that should behave like foundations to avoid floating.
---
Nope you did the right choice, you could have been banned for duping. Too bad, I'll just go there and see.
---
So a Fo76 get-together in Helvetia next year? :) 
---
No the wanting strangers to visit your base. With it being in a very public location. These are the people that "host" parties, role play as responders and constantly talk about how much they love the community. The type of overly friendly people that turn out to be cannibals in fallout 3. So polite it's scary and yet so naive that they still aren't intimidating. You may have seen them posing for pictures after the parade even though they had done the mission 30 times. Those people.
---
It could very well be people complaining now are different from the people asking for High Level characters.
---
I'm just confused why they didn't just go both ways with it: Bring over anything you want to Survival AND if you want to create from scratch a Survival Locked character who only gets put with other Survival Locked characters... by all means. 
---
Lmaoooo boi if you dont take this upvote
---
Lol what? What do you expect? Either out smart them or play adventure mode. 
---
went there right away as well, I Want To Believe.
---
Lol no clue, I'm choosing to not do survival mode
---
What‚Äôs the fun in that?
---
That is awesome.  How long did it take you guys to make those?  I am a crafty gal by nature, but I have seriously little patience for paper mache sometimes.
---
Never mind I misread you‚Äôre reply :)
---
1 tap with a shitty gun then switch to your sniper quick and kill them.... 
---
Pretty sure it was patched due to people using foundations to block workshop takeovers. The first changed the rules and then patched the foundations.
---
Not sure why they did the rugs/fireplaces though.
---
It‚Äôs worse in a team, my weapons can drop 200 damage for no reason. 
---
You said it!
---
On PS4; Got killed after 15 minutes of joining server. Spent whole time capturing and building a workshop. Group of 110+ levels come around and murder spree me. I‚Äôm level 83 now. Couldn‚Äôt properly defend / run / turrets did seemingly zero amounts of damage. But that was ok. 
---
I reloaded into adventure mode, and turns out from that one death I lost at least 70 gears (now have 4 left). all but 4 of my stimpacks (I had over 45) 
---
Feeling a bit frustrated now because I didn‚Äôt realize how damaging the losses would be? Or maybe I‚Äôm just doing it all wrong?
---
No OP. Your idea is as bad as not using paragraphs.
---
This is why I held onto my double capacity lmg for so long. It rips everything to hell now.
---
Then what will happen once these brand new characters become a high level and then new players start showing up? The same thing will happen, with the higher level players killing the low level ones.
---
Honestly, I have never used it for anything other than making paper mache, and I am not much of a bird guy to begin with.  The Saiga is a horribly impractical firearm for anything I would do with a shotgun.  It's pretty much a safe queen and a talking piece.  I like Antlers, so its 308 Win in the woods for me.  
---
That's really awful. Thank you for explaining.
---
Came back to the game after 3 months gone last night, had a blast. The new update this morning broke the camp system, ruining all my hard work. Not a great (re)first impression. 
---
Ahh, ok. I don‚Äôt mind people visiting my CAMP but I didn‚Äôt choose my spot for that reason. That‚Äôs not [me](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) 
---
It's worse than a Beta.  It's a #Bethesda BETA!   That's like, pre-alpha to the rest of the world :)
---
I realize that others may find this kind of thing cool, but to me this is sooooo cheesey lmao but I wish you luck and hope you guys make a killing tbh!!!
---
It didn't :(
---
Look for empty area on the map that have spawn points of critters like foxes and chickens. Generally this spots won‚Äôt have enemies spawn nearby. 
---
I did it two days ago.  It doesn't happen until the person leaves the team though.
---
The cores i usually find are pretty empty and irrc they weigh about 3 pounds each and i havent put any point into power armor perks. Whereas i have put plenty of perks into perks that require i DONT use power armor. And no as of yet i havent run into vampire armor. As for rads.. Couldnt the 6am/6pm max mixed with radx just completely counter most radgain? Im level 48 but im still at the top of the world... No idea how close i am to endgame content
---
Sigh... Platform? (how do people still not think to mention this)
---
I think the only people shown should be  wanted guys. I was questing and doing my own own thing when I ended up being the longest survivor. Not for long when a lvl 200 with power armour and a minigun showed up.
---
I wouldn't have minded but a scorchbeast was attacking my camp down the hill and he buggered off instead of helping me fight it.
---
#Shithouse.
---
Everyone here is exceedingly kind today. Must be the new survival mode?
---
&gt;The people complaining about being camp spawn killed are the same guys that have been using slap damage to kill other players that had no wish to do PVP before?
---
Are they?
---
Don't get me wrong, there are issues with fast travel protection, or that spawn camping shouldn't be fixed, or that a rebalance needs to be done.
---
Just don't go into a PvP heavy mode unprepared and complain.
---
Don't carry loads of Chems and complain they drop.
---
Survival should be for the players that have invested in the game.
---
If you don't do good in shooters you might flail.
---
Caps lost on death is relative to your level, so it makes sense.
---
Also...it might look like a cement cube on the outside, but looks like the next episode of cribs on the inside. I can deal with outside,  i just miss moving/rebuilding my base weekly to have something to do.
---
They do.  We get a lot of West Virginia people who drive down to the NC medical center I volunteer at for various  specialized treatments.  Super sweet and always polite.  I've had people who come from less than an hour away bitch about the drive more than WV folks.
---
Pretty much, that way if you die you drop the minimum, or you use them up when you are fighting. Since you can transfer between servers/worlds, you can just pick up what you need in the safety of your CAMP or whatnot then go back in.
---
Most players never saw the promotions or paid particular attention to any masks. I think people got frustrated because they kept getting the same masks despite doing the event many many times. I know I did, though not enough to be angry. I enjoyed the event because it was quirky and attracted lots of players to one place. And I think the owl mask looks the best. :)
---
No it doesn't. Anybody who hasnt tried it yet should avoid it like aids infected cancer cells.
---
Speaking from personal experience with this game, it is essentially the Destiny/Destiny 2 of the Fallout franchise in terms of substance. 
---
At least destiny didnt run at under 30fps 90% of the time like this game does.
---
Well weren‚Äôt they capable of surviving the blast, just not the radiation 
---
"edit: Sorry if the formatting is awful, on mobile. Will fix later" try reading the whole post before deciding to not consider other ideas ( :
---
Eh...itd be the same honestly. You can display character names instead of psn ids on Bloodborne, I went to do some co-op with a buddy and his characters name was Frothy Ejakulate
---
Happening to a lot of people.  It happened to me, too, but appeqrs to have resolved itself after playing for a while.  
---
How does kill the queen recommend 8+ players work out when everyone can attack everyone else not on their team? Is pacifist still going to be a thing?
---
Well it's fun for me, because i'm not losing my stuff. I'm on survival just for those challenges.
---
really do wish it would store your workstation stuff. with how often you get d/c'd...it kills my drive to build 
---
first workstation i spent an hour building concrete barriers, turret watch towers, an enclosed building for crafting.  and lights around the entire perimeter.
---
....then i left to go get some gears.
---
got d/ced.
---
returned......and felt all my motivation to keep building more and more.....gone.
---
all i got is my camp now.
---
HAH! And now people are hiding behind loading doors to places like bunkers and sitting there with shotguns. You CAN'T get someone out of there. Anyone who enters just dies the second they load in. This shit is so broken...
---
Heavy weapon builds rise up! 
---
are explosive heavy builds good yet tho?
---
I've never seen this ever, but... glad I won't have to now I guess lol
---
On Bethesda plz list. Please read it before posting suggestions. Thread reported.
---
Oh ok, was just making sure they didn‚Äôt do it on purpose and remove them permanently.
---
Who t.f. walks around with 257 of anything that's not ammo! omfg.
---
lol trolling, I made a post outlining my experience and saying I was open to hear from others. I also made several posts supporting Bethesda's efforts to improve this mode. It's hilarious that you'd talk about ignoring things that don't line up with opinions... take a look in the mirror, bud.
---
The original announcement about Survival mode resulted in one dominant reddit post that had 2k+ upvotes. That post was strongly against this decision. There were NO posts supporting it with anywhere near that much consensus. You are living a lie, and I'm not falling for it.
---
Please continue being a derpy child. Your arguments are weak. I think you need a reality check. ;-)
---
Welcome to ze club ;-)
---
Not sure why the downvotes. I love this game but a lot of it is the community not the actual gameplay which is decent st best. 
---
No it doesn't. If you're on the leaderboard and at camp, might as well lol.
---
Meds, or anything of the aid category. 
---
They said that it's seasonal, so maybe you can get back on fo76 next year to see joyous musician again
---
that was my plan as well, though I haven't gone on yet. Go into Adventure mode, stash everything, then head into Survival with my BFG and some trashy golf outfit.. just wish there was some way to stash caps as well..
---
It's PvP arena they just didn't want to call it that, most likely some marketing reasons to figure out misleading name
---
I know it sucks, I hate losing my junk (I think there is a dirty joke in that sentence), but it is the price of dying. Sometimes we have a bad day and just suck, sometimes it is an accident, as in your case, sometimes the game surprises us in a scary way with something unexpected. 
---
The alternative would be a death debuff of some kind after a death, but in most games that just makes it more likely to die over and over again.
---
What to do when someone takes your junk? Not much to do... shot them and hope they accept PvP?
---
damn now that is how you counter an argument! boom!  Pelican is right about this
---
Id recommend treating the survival server as a seperate server - your cache and camp doesnt carry over.  Players can bring an old character to survival, but there is nothing in the inventory.  
---
Also, losing caps upon death is a huge turnoff, if there is no way to bank excess caps.
---
I hope they‚Äôre not limited. Also are they going to return black bird???
---
Huh?
---
Ok cool. Why would you use your camp in survival though? Don‚Äôt show crazy people your house!
---
I have a feeling that backpacks will only become available to prestige characters and that initially their utility will be minor since characters will need them simply to help deal with gaining hundreds of lbs. of encumbrance by losing use of weight saving perk cards when they're reset to lvl.1.  Maybe I'm being pessimistic.
---
Add no trading to this and I'm fully on board
---
Paranoia would make that hard ):
---
Hmm I wonder if they say in the patch notes.
---
What if you're in the middle of a quest during those 15 minutes?
---
Working to rebalance is the way to go. I'm not optimistic for a few reasons, but they might be able to improve this a lot. They've certainly done a good job improving 76 in general over the last few months.
---
It is just to follow the road down west from Lady Janets. Spawns right after the buss. Normally I get him in 5-6 server jumps, sometimes less, on a bad day a few more.
---
Spawn camping sounds more like something that the people who were abusing slap damage mechanics would be doing.
---
I'm fairly certain that the people complaining about spawn campers were the same ones who were complaining about getting 1 shot killed in pacifist mode.
---
As expected....... survival mode is a wet dream for dupers and griefers.
---
There are literally groups of players level 200+ teamed up outside of Vault 76, camping any and all new characters coming out. And because of how the game is designed, you can only respawn at 76 because you have no train stations unlocked when you start a new character.
---
I kinda find it hilarious that there are people willing to sit there and kill low level dudes.. What a life they must live.
---
The main issue with this is some lvl 100 can just join his lvl 5 friend and the problem will be even worse. Even if it goes in the middle and both players are placed in a lvl 50 server, you still have a lvl 5 having a horrible time and a lvl 100 still beating a bunch of level 50s who dont have as much legendary gear.
---
No restriction on PVP. That's what they promised. That's what you are getting. 
---
That's a solid idea. I'm generally a PVE player but going to go home and try a new character in survival.  I think it will be interesting to see how many times I'll die in the first hour lol
---
there, now that's a balanced comment with constructive criticism..take my vote!
---
Isn't this platform specific?
---
How much would it cost? What ever the game says it's worth? Or is set by the other player?
---
Or just don‚Äôt go into the PvP server if you‚Äôre the type to get butthurt about a high level one shotting you. There is no one forcing you to go into PVP. This isn‚Äôt like the division where all the best loot was locked to the dark zone and you HAD to go In there if you were limited on time to farm otherwise 
---
I can help out if you need, GT: KnowledgeHound 
---
8000 xp sounds really good.
---
I think if I were doing Westek I'd just be careful about being too noisy with the super mutants outside. I'm camped about halfway between Westek and Fort Defiance and I can hear whenever somebody is doing something at either.
---
Why on earth would you run survival and carry 120 stimpacks? Didn't read patch notes? :D
---
I surrounded my crops with concrete barriers. They slow down the rad rats and moles but also hide the strange gap between terra firma and the C.A.M.P. plants. Only the tops are visible. :)
---
I'm not complaining, earned over 7k caps as i went there prepared for broken mess. Last week's i planned and build lvl 35 character to get profits from the new game mode that's working exactly how i expected.
---
I'm glad that slap damage is gone, but the bigger problem is people attacking your camp. If someone kills me I just lose the little bit of junk I have on me. If someone destroys my camp, it could take hours to grind for all the mats to repair it. 
---
It gets worse, I have two characters with camps in the same bombed out building.  Now it insists I can't have a camp there... on one character.  The other one's camp is still in there.   Obviously not simultaneously.  Go figure?  That's on PS4
---
Murder Hobo is the profression I always wanted but never knew existed.
---
Fred Jones approves
---
Wow. I‚Äôm gonna head on in a little bit and see if I can kill some of those campers. 
---
From what I've read, they plan to open two of the vaults this summer, and it's all supposed to be geared towards players who have higher levels. 
---
There's also the new Prestige system coming out, which has vague details but is supposed to allow you to "reset" your character, with a new legendary system that you can dispense your points in to. It's designed for higher level players to grow their perks and SPECIAL's into a more advanced stage than the average newer player. 
---
But you're right; the current system in place isn't really designed for later game play. It's almost like Fallout 76 was released prematurely...but I think this was part of the marketing strategy: release a hype game, have it fall short, then revamp the game and include a ton of content later on, thereby increasing sales during the second "revamping". That's just a theory, I don't have any fact behind that, but the rate they are releasing new content either their development team is working overtime to keep this game afloat, or this was the plan all along from Beth and they are trying a brilliant but possibly flawed new plan. 
---
Either way, the next few months should offer some good content for end game players to enjoy themselves on, even if currently none seems to exist.
---
Well, there is Adventure Mode, that is for the new players.
---
I guess I didn't expect much. 
---
I did paper mache mine, so it took a few days of applying layers and painting, most of it waiting for layers to dry. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the deathclaw is made out of cardboard, duct tape, and paint, so I don‚Äôt think it took him as long to make his. 
---
Well, I'd be more surprised if it's 'Little Johnny', fresh from the vault with a clean pair if tighty whities and a happy thought in his mind. Just that there seem to be a lot of complaints from people that have entered Survival mode knowing the conditions present. These MOST LIKELY are the people that have enjoyed the conditions presented up to today.
---
Oh believe me, these murder hobos dong give a shit about the caps. They do it for free
---
That's survival mode for ya.
---
Also, if you are one of the many that are hoarding every 3\* armour piece in your stash in the hope that it is ultimately worthwhile when the Legendary vendor comes along in May, spend some time modding them all to be Light or Ultra Light builds. Knocks 2 or 3 pounds off per every piece you have.
---
Cool stay out then the best thing about this game is that you have choice. You‚Äôre not forced into PvP anymore 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring
---
^ Umm, no. It definitely did.
---
you have been lucky...im lvl 250 and most times when i claim a workshop i get 1 shotted
---
I can confirm this issue is present for me as well.
---
Why would you try to kill the SBQ in a survival server though? The only benefit is xp boost which I doubt you NEED. 
---
i think EVERYONE who is simply trying out the new game mode is getting spawn killed, filthy casuals as well as high level griefers
---
Yeah, not going to make my eyes bleed just to be considerate when making something difficult to read is just as inconsiderate.
---
Then you have 15 minutes to reach a point where it saves your progress and server jump. Yes, the DMV would be the ultimate shitstorm to change  bracket while in the middle of. Most other quests can easily reach the next update point in a few minutes. Or just give it a longer timer? 30 minutes?
---
Of the three times the event was not interrupted by a server crash for me, I got the same mask twice and then the third time didn‚Äôt even get one.

"But now we're the ones getting killed and having our CAMPs destroyed!!!" - Every Post with PVPers Complaining About PVP
---
I agree you loose so much its not fun. Wish it was like gta where you only loose a small amount and you can just respawn down the road. Its fun to not have to worry and just kill each other a bunch of times.
---
I agree with that to an extent. If they made people start fresh than they can earn their gear like everyone else and maybe just have certain legendary effect drops. Eliminate TSEs, increase assassin drops etc. Im not a fan that you can just go back and forth between modes. At least say hey you can bring your character over now but once you do you can only use it in survival. Weapons and all. The problem is they basically only reward you for killing others nothing else matters. There's no reason to cooperate even for a few minutes. I get its a beta and blah blah but people on here have better ideas than bethesdea and the ideas of the mode arent in beta just the gameplay is.
---
I am sure there are plenty of them without the incentive, no need to reward it out of proportion imo 
---
Damn, you can't even get one to hop on for 2 minutes to help you out? ..Might need new friends
---
Sorry friend, I don‚Äôt think doughnuts and sausage will satiate your specific palette. Might wanna pack a cooler 
---
I mean, all the posts mentioned hoping all the griefers went to survival... Why would anyone be surprised?
---
Just don't buy anything, they don't deserve the money. 
---
Good to know I'm not alone in this, every other skin works for you, correct?
---
For me, everything but the pump is working.
---
Great idea! :) both modes actually  would be cool..
---
When I played this afternoon I ignored the pvp war at Whitesprings. 20 minutes later I was the player with the longest life. I continued to do my own thing but I was ready for when they came for me. After about an hour the first guy appeared. I holstered my gun, but he fired at me. I killed him because he made me. And then his friends came up and took me out. 
---
It was a lot of fun. But I think making longest lives a target is a problem. From now on as soon as I see I am in the top 3, I am stashing my junk and getting ready for the horde.
---
I do miss it quite a bit, and I'd love to get to try it with the improvements to gunplay we've seen since Fallout 4 (cause, let's be honest, guns feel way better in the newer games compared to 3 and New Vegas)
---
Doesn't everyone try doing that?
---
Totally legit way to play, now the easiest path to riches too!
---
A use for the syringer! Didn't see that coming!!
---
So you speak for everyone now?
---
In my suggestion he can't join his level 5 friend, because he don't belong in that bracket.
---
The lvl 5 plays in one bracket on a different server farm he can't join. They each stay within their bracket.
---
Limited, not exclusive.
---
They are now playing in a server where every single player is a dick  like them and they are not happy.  I love it. 
---
Not sure.
---
I didn't mean in game, I meant irl.
---
Isn't it nice to know that Bethesda prioritizes the needs of that group over the litany of other issues the game has?
---
Idk, its pretty cool. Longer you survive, the higher the chances that actions finds you.
---
Yes, this.  They need to implement something like the Keynuker mod.  Or at least note if that a set of keys you're about to pick up is one you already have, similar to the (Known) notes for plans.
---
Maybe that is the solution. Does it show your exact location or just the area that person is in? 
---
Petition for Bethesda to send Helvetia life-sized protectrons to run the parades 
---
Hi! This is a visual issue affecting the patch version displayed in the launcher that we're actively investigating. As long as you've downloaded today's update you should still be able to play. You can also confirm the current version of Fallout 76 that you have installed by entering Settings from the Main Menu and checking the lower-left corner of the screen. This should display the version of Fallout 76 that you're running (should be [1.1.1.2](https://1.1.1.2) for PC or [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) for Consoles as of today's patch.)
---
Yes. I got a quad hunting rifle, and even with the largest magazine, it was only 22 rounds per. 
---
If you didn't like it before, you're not gonna like it now. If you liked it before, you'll love it now.
---
Survival is bad though.

How the hell do your guys names say mega sloth brotherhood etc
---
Exactly what I thought when I first saw the leaderboards. Top 3 marked on map, was pretty good counter to it.
---
Good, it should be full of greifers, greifers vs greifers . Gets them out of the main game and gives them a place to be themselves without annoying non-PVP players.
---
Seems like it's working as expected üòÅ
---
Sure, but with this suggestion low levels can enjoy pvp too. I assume other peoples enjoyment don't lessens yours?
---
I've been looking for that helmet since I first saw marine armor is available in 76. Can you also help me with it?
---
I've never been able to join the server of a recent player.  Only of people on my friends list.  It lets me send friend invites, block, mute, etc.  But never gives me the Join option like it does on a friend.
---
I tried a couple times cause there was a server with an dead confederate guy that had another player next to it.  Left, then figured I could try to join that player, but it didn't give me the option.
---
I saw a xo1 set standing and when over to see if the guy was OK at a fashnat event but there was no name it looked like it was dumped so I left then I noticed a guy flying around in a costume with jet pack vapors looked mad.
---
You can just jump off a cliff or something and it resets
---
yes, you should just jump right into survival mode, youre gonna love it!
---
Well, you can still do it but I hear the consequences are way, way worse for everyone involved.
---
Yikes lol
---
Depends on your objectives.   I‚Äôve been CAMPed next to the Overseer‚Äôs Cache for a long time.
---
The CAMP offers free facilities to passing travelers, in a quiet neighborhood.   All the crafting stations, water purifiers, crops, bed, musical instruments (drums, piano and double bass).   There‚Äôs even a water pump, although the nearby stream is a faster source of Dirty Water.
---
The area near the stream is also a good source of ingredients for Healing Salve.
---
Before I go exploring, I craft quality Level 1 Armor or weapons (or both) and store them in the Overseer‚Äôs Cache and her red container.  Plus Healing Salve and ammo.
---
Very occasionally there‚Äôll be something interesting in the nearby spawn spot
---
Why do you carry so much on you? I never keep more than 5 stims on me at a time and only a few food/drink items.
---
Oh ok, thank you for the link! I was kinda scared they were starting from scratch right after I just got up to 800. Was thinking about that excavator paint.
---
I'd settle for that lol. Dreads still have a natural wastelander touch. And pretty universal too. Twisted Hairs gotta start sometime.
---
How is it bad? It seemed a little exciting but also could see it being annoying. 
---
Of course I read them. 
---
It all comes down to stash limit. And I was curious as well. But my presumption was the random amount is something like 1-6 items, maybe 1-10, but not  half of everything you have. I'm not against this mechanic, just raising awareness. And yeah, seems a bit extreme.
---
Don't panic is your name, and that's why it's called "BETA".
---
I honestly wish there was some kinda implementation of gear loss in some fashion I think that would make it more wastelandy lol. Even if it was just a 1/5 chance of 1 random item in your inventory having the option of being taken by the other player I think would be awesome for my more cutthroat raider/slaver playstyle 
---
Does anybody actually still play this game?
---
Limited does not always mean one time. 
---
I wrecked waves of robots with the lmg during awol armaments yesterday. Good Lord it was fun.
---
Thai issue isn't so much a level problem but rather a gear problem. You could be a level 200 who doesn't have or use god tier gear. Same goes for the opposite, I've seen some guys who are level 5 running full blown bloodied builds. As of late anytime I went to trade with someone on lfg sites they asked me if I'd like the weapon or armour at level 5 or 45. So having this wouldn't kelp anything. The only way it could be balanced this way is to look at the players gear and put bloodied builds with bloodied builds, but even then it would be next to impossible to achieve.
---
It doesn't always happen, and I think it's more reflective of current server condition than anything else.  If you get to the reactor phase and see that lag when you do the pipes, you should consider server hopping because it's not going to get any better.  There are little cues in the overworld that hint at a deteriorating server too, like non-existent enemy awareness, rubber banding players, vendors that take forever, etc.
---
Wow, they really did a great job or recreating Helvetia!
---
I'm a game developer.  Whenever some AI or UI thing starts using an odd location, I check if it's the origin point (0, 0).  Most of the time it is.  Uninitialized values will get you every time.  
---
I'm hopping for 30 days if Halloween new costumes events at each of the town's.candy recipes I just hope it happens
---
I hate how much sway these youtubers have on public opinions.
---
That having been said, no, this game is not in a good place, it is not and has never been close to good, and likely will remain that way.
---
It performs like pure shit, and any argument pertaining to "but the endgame is about building and interactions with other players" needs to stop. That isn't content. Thats like an author selling you a blank book and saying "write your own story".
---
My opinion is one that was 100% formed by my roughly 100 hours of play time.
---
Any defense of this game and future content is pure shilling at this point.
---
Thanks for the reply! After a couple of restarts it's showing the right patch now and I'm able to select survival mode. 
---
He meant 4. 4 didn‚Äôt have a key ring 
---
You imagined wrong bud , they‚Äôve stated weeks in advance how there will be tougher punishments for deaths as well as higher rewards for killing , pretty sure that ( as well as no pvp rules ) was one of the main reasons for the mode in the first place.
---
It‚Äôs change flair in the subreddit settings! It‚Äôs top right when you are on the subreddit on mobile
---
Good dude, good prices! Can‚Äôt wait to do business again. x
---
If you left around launch expecting it to be drastically different about 100 days later, you're going to be disappointed.  It's way too soon, most of the core functions are the same.  
---
Maybe around early Autumn things will be drastically different, but right now it's still very much the same game, just with a few more tweaks, and light additions, but nothing extraordinarily new.
---
Yeah Quad's are 4 times the base capacity. 
---
The chem loses are crazy high.  I actually got lucky and fought normal players like me and went 6-2...  I still used up 6 mines, 4 grenades, tons of .50 for my exploding machine gun,  AND lost like 30 stims and 40 purified waters.  That was when I was winning haha.  I made caps though.  Now I know to carry less aid when going for fights.
---
Those weapons are pretty garbage and pretty easy to get, even for worst PVP player. 
---
Yea... I meant 4 not NV...
---
The spawn protection was increased, but isn't working at all causing you to respawn dead. Go figure. 
---
Lol at the bads downvoting us because they're bad at the game and don't know how to farm and craft efficiently.
---
They're probably working on it still.
---
Even at killing low lvls is a cap making Enterprise. Right now you can sell 3-5 rounds of ammo per cap. Survival let's you effectively trade 1 round for 2-40 caps. 
---
Hmm. Time to wipe the dust off the TS LMG (plus one other star I can't remember) I have been ignoring in the stash.
---
Wtf did thy Nerf the rifles in adventure?
---
What system do you play on? Just checking to see if it is just contained to mine.
---
Drop junk and some aid
---
Tbh I'm surprised people still play this piece of shit game. Also I put well over 250 hours into the game before mid December. I tried to stick with the game and hoped they would fix anything but it seems like the game is still is a shit show state 3 months after I gave it up lawl. 
---
Like impossibly hard. I can't even imagine wanting to do this day one. Hopefully their account name is darwin
---
Agree! If you see the flash just "duck and cover" 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWH4tWkZpPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWH4tWkZpPU)

Skins are always released like 2 weeks later or not at all
---
Get a trusted friend to transfer the caps for you to another account. Or buy another account and run 2 76. I use another account to stash my junk and caps :D
---
Always welcome and your next purchase will have 10% off.
---
Yo if you don't want more downvotes I would make it clear that this is a joke
---
From someone else? Because indont mess with other peoples workshops 
---
But they're named. It's not something i need, i simply want to collect them and it's much easier to do so without having to worry that someone is stalking me
---
Wasn't the change allowing you to initiate a takeover from anywhere in the workshop enough?
---
If you have a slow PC you'll not load before spawn protection runs out. Also you basically get killed in seconds by everyone running around with their TSE.
---
Then don't fast travel there? Don't fast travel to popular train stations. ESPECIALLY whitesprings.
---
Same. I am having a lot of fun playing with the  various angled walls for some nice designs.
---
Well that too. 
---
Then it‚Äôs even less of a challenge and less of a reason to be there. I just wish there was something extra from it than a couple quick clicks. 
---
Ideal world this is what most of us want. Thinking about it code wise, it's quite easy to set a property (pvp) of an object (player) on an event (challenge workshop).  It's way more complicated to run a constant evaluation of whether you are in range of the workshop and constantly update the property.  However. They're already doing similar checks with rewards of events if you're in or out of the area. My guess is that those checks aren't real-time or fast enough and would simply open up the door to exploit boundary crossing during a battle. Imagine you're losing the battle but you just step out of the ring to heal up. You would have to stay locked into the zone once you defend the contest. 
---
Had an interesting bug where during Fertile Grounds we (my self and two friends) completely froze up, we couldn't move but keyboard commands still did some things (just not everything) so we could open menus but not select anything and escape out of the menus.
---
This hasn't happened before for this quest
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
I agree, but since it is hard to see and predict what gear someone will use and not from perhaps a lot of gear they carry, levels is what we have to go on.  Perhaps brackets up to 70+ at that point players start being sorted by how well they have performed on the survival servers instead. Kill/death ratio, hours survived etc, etc. 
---
Then 70+ players gets placed according to how well they have performed in the lvl 70+ Elite brackets. 
---
I consider it an upgrade for me if the douchebag sitting on the roof of Whitespring shooting cars trying to kill me has somewhere else to play.
---
..a trusted friend? do they sell those at the rail vendors? ;)
---
seriously though, that's a good idea, thanks! 
---
This seems like it creates an even bigger problem where friends wont be able to play with each other unless theyre very close in level, which is unlikely
---
That's impossible you have temporary immunity after fast traveling
---
Bethesda - a couple minor issues I'd like to throw out there.
---
1. I've noticed after Patch 6 that whenever I drop a bag, it's weirdly offset.  It's often behind and to my left instead of where I'm currently standing.  This is pretty annoying when it comes to offering items for other players, because I often have to hunt down where the bag actually went.
---
2. If the Pip-Boy Radio volume slider is turned all the way down, certain non-radio music doesn't play.  For a fact, silo music doesn't.  It also seems to apply to other "scripted" music like when you've initiated a launch and while you fight the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Interesting. I'm looking to just quest and adventure in survival for the added tension and FUN, but becoming longest life changes that up a bit. If there were more incentives for it I get it, but I'm not so sure... In any event I'm excited to try it out
---
Well what level are you and what type of gear do you have? 
---
thats not them dieing through combat, thats them dieing by becoming hostile, they also isnt your companion at the time if they attack you, are you stupid?
---
What an honor! Praise
---
&gt;  Some kid wanted to team up to do a SBQ run.  
---
LOL! You really thought that you'd be able to run missions in survival mode?  Dude, survival is a shit show with everyone shooting at each other. That's what it was always destined to be.   That's true whether everyone started out with new characters or not. 
---
I just wish they would restrict it to survival mode only and get rid of PVP completely from adventure mode.  Or if not removing it completely, at least make it so work shops can be defended and the person contesting it is at a serious disadvantage.  There's no reason someone should be able to easily waltz into a workshop with missile turrets and take it from you. But that's the current system. 
---
thats fine, but don't say my idea is bad without actually knowing what it is
---
Go For Commando/Auto Rifle because LMG will compete with 2H for STR perk assignment.  Plus, they won't need PA for armor penetration perk.
---
Leaderboard is thing that brings you the actions, makes it actually meaningful. It's like stars in GTA- you don't see much of a action when you got 2 stars, but as time passes and you get more stars, things get more interesting. Same is with leaderboards here- more times passes, more likely you are getting action.
---
You went into pvp with power armor. Obviously you were unprepared.
---
Yeah, if I hear something like 19th through 26th, I expect that all of the 26th to be playable pretty much up to midnight.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of hours in a short amount of time. I would have quit too...
---
The outage was resolved 4 hours ago, they even stated in their Twitter. https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1110607859946045443

This is a completely different thing.

no i mean unclaimed workshops..someone will.come along and kill.me..either as im setting things up or when i come back to defend it
---
My first nuke was Helvetia the other day
---
Yall MUST be trolling at this point lmaooo
---
Gotcha
---
Legitimately a good point.  You'd be swimming in Mini-Nukes if you did Fasnacht, just like how I'm swimming in Ballistic Fiber after Mothman Week.
---
Exploding cars deal slap damage as well FYI. They're just wasting bullets unless you shoot back.
---
Well done. No that's not sarcasm. 
---
I may never drop a nuke. Tipped 206 yesterday and still haven't felt like it.
---
That is a different first nuke though, I approve.
---
It's in beta still.
---
Who ya talking about?
---
Have you tried the suggested finger snapping method for it?
---
I mean they increased the range of the ‚Äúcontest‚Äù how hard could it be to make it have to have owner + contender  in same workshop = pvp
---
Obviously I‚Äôm overly simplifying it... but the game knows when it‚Äôs not your work shop and the game knows when it it‚Äôs your workshop.... I‚Äôll leave the programming up to Bethesda I‚Äôm just coming up with the idea lol
---
Bethesda please fix the nuke silo disconnecting from server
---
Ah, I can see a bit of how he did it now that you mention the cardboard.  Paper mache is fickle stuff sometimes (along with, as you mentioned, the endless waiting to dry) and I commend you for your persistence.  They both look wonderful.
---
I read enough, it is bad
---
Well now I feel kinda bad for following that douchebag to the golf club and killing that level 62 3* ghoul.
---
Take my upvote. Also youre complaining in the wrong place, most everyone here is a mindless shill willing to accept whatever train wreck they receive
---
Run the "scan and repair" tool in the Bethesda launcher
---
There are only two mods though.
---
Yeah i was being killed by 4 different people spawn killing the train station. Yes there was stagger but i was dying without it. Dont think they were able to bank criticals as i was dyinging it the first two bullets. Seems like cav isnt activating at all.
---
Ya moms
---
found it in watoga. 1588 caps, i only have 598. rip me
---
You think there is a lot of lvl 5 and lvl 100s who plan of playing together on Survival servers? I see this as a rare occurrence. Co-op is more likely on Adventure servers which won't be affected by this. In most games with battlegrounds these sort of brackets are standard and work fine.
---
It is disappointing to see the number not go up further, but it's the right choice of balance. That's plenty of ammo. I found my quad combat shotgun had 32 shots, I added a drum and got 36. That's a facepalm. A huge brick on bottom adds 4 shells.
---
You‚Äôre right dude I just imagined the whole thing. No, I didn‚Äôt have temporary immunity. I died as soon as the game loaded. It went loading screen&gt;black screen&gt;hear person swinging at me&gt;load in&gt;die&gt;respawn&gt;repeat.  Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs impossible when I literally sat through it. Who do you think you are to call me a liar?
---
I'll be ready. Already have my camp shop setup. Will be gathering supplies daily.
---
make blueprints.

I'm on PS4 so I might be right. Today I am not proud to be a Sony fan.
---
I can‚Äôt believe people are still complaining about TSE weapons. Seriously, if you still get wrecked by TSE weapons, your build must be garbage. Bloodied builds indeed do a lot of damage but are easy to counter as well. 
---
Yes the metal and leather skins work as well as the combat armor and hunting rifle(although I‚Äôve had these ones) I‚Äôve tried relogging a few times and I just assume it‚Äôs a bug and hotfix patch is probably already being worked on.
---
Its a really poorly optimized game still, almost a year in. Although there have been some improvements, Id say give jt a few more months to accrue bug fixes and QOL updates
---
Sort of brings up an interesting point though, of whether or not cards should be level-locked in Survival (and perhaps another reason why they should have been separate).  It just seems to me that any low-leveled player in Survival isn't just disadvantaged, they are *massively* disadvantaged.  They'd have no way of fighting back, retaining Stimpacks, or even maintaining a decent supply of Caps because they'll get raked over the coals wherever they go.  There's no skill to it whatsoever.
---
uhm... then please tell me how much % 980 from 1400 is.. because your math is kinda off.
---
its LESS then 50% off right now.
---
you save 420 caps (ay) of the 1400 total.
---
500
---
&gt;   Can‚Äôt the PVP of s contested workshop be limited to the confines of the work shop area? 
---
I think it should be limited to a DEFEND-ABLE area.  As is, someone can contest the workshop in a spot where there's zero defenses. 
---
And based on what I've seen, when someone contests a workshop, the defenses you built don't even fire on the person contesting it.   In fact when it happened to me, I think my turrets started firing on me before he even finished contesting it. 
---
Your desire to play. 
---
I‚Äôd love to not die from one shot. Been like this since day one pretty much.
---
This is exactly what I mean. You prepared for it. You went in expecting full anarchy, and have profited from it. That's great for the game's hardcore players, I hope the eventual 'fixes' for the mode don't impact on your gaming. Honestly I have no intention of poking my nose in it, but I'm still enjoying my gaming.
---
Did you try and attack while loading?  If you do, that cancels out the immunity.
---
You can survive a fat man explosion in them though!
---
Limited, exclusive... Ok then I'll just get it all 5 years down the road when everything is on 99% sale lol.
---
Hello duper
---
untyped power armor mods are for Excavator.  
---
All other PA have the PA designation on the mod (T series, X01, Ultracite)
---
Haha fair enough, although clearly some folks already know. Too bad two-shot is such a durability hit. Launchers still have crap durability, this doesn‚Äôt help!
---
For the life of me I don't know why Bethesda left stealth boys, magical weapons and armor and VATS in survival. For Christ sake, an invisible person can shoot you in the head without even having to aim! I've never even heard of something like that in a competitive game. Just... Remarkably poor judgement.
---
Provide evidence of this then. The patch notes say, temporary immunity after fast traveling or respawning unless you fire your gun. I am calling you a lair until you can prove it boi
---
I was able to get it for $25 2 months ago and have loved it since then. There‚Äôs still bugs and glitches but in all the hours I‚Äôve put in to it, I‚Äôve only been frustrates 3 times by a random crash or me being stuck somewhere.
---
To prepare for today, Toosalty was breaking my lowbies camp last night while I was trying to build it.
---
Can't you choose to re spawn to a different area? this would suck to constantly die lol ..
---
I got two of them how much you offering 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna keep at it. Just going to be more aware at the scoreboard, and kill my self or stash all my stuff in preparation. 
---
Using in game generated atoms is cool, but yeah I 100% agree. We shouldnt be rewarding such a poorly executed game with complacent microtransactions, thats how you make a company filthy rich and show them that youre okay with whatever theyre willing to shit into your hands
---
Thanks. I was hoping for a whopping 340 rounds total. I'm giving it a spin to see if that capacity is good enough or should I go with a perforating magazine (still 80 rounds) and +40% armor ignore on top of 36% of the tank killer perk.
---
That‚Äôs why I offer the suggestion to blueprint structures so you can quickly place them back down in case you get DC
---
I'm honestly amazed at how many times this same thing is asked daily
---
I already feel like there is no consequence in dying. Just stow your junk or free yourself of junk attachment mentality and then its cake.
---
Workshops right now, to put nicely, are bullshit. There is zero incentive for me to claim one bc of the PvP mechanic that is constantly exploited. It should be like the Wild West.... you want to fight over my workshop, I show up, and we have a shoot out.... should I even contest your contesting of my ownership.
---
I found him once in the woods outside whitespring next a weird piece of equipment.  
---
Whats your build? Im trying to make something viable 
---
Seriously? That‚Äôs a crazy amount!
---
How is max reduction achieved? I‚Äôve fought against players who seem to have reached that threshold since I can never seem to do damage against them even with something like a TS fatman. Are these armors used in tangent with perks and certain aid items?
---
In a service game like this I‚Äôd expect they want to maximize the amount of people on servers so the game can last, having a bunch of different ecosystems is probably harder to manage stability wise But it‚Äôs still beta so who knows 
---
I totally forgot you can do that. Been too long since I moved CAMP.
---
‚ÄúBoi‚Äù okay guy lol. I don‚Äôt really care if you believe me or not. I saw it happen to other players and it happened to me 10+ times. Sorry I don‚Äôt have a fucking recording setup to ‚Äúprovide evidence‚Äù of my gameplay. Again, who do you think you are? Having an ego trip are we?
---
It isn't really about levels, as it doesnt matter past 50. And as far as duped items go their pretty much just like everything else. What i find works for me at the moment is a piece of chameleon/unyielding fully specked stealth/rifle/bloodied build. All of my equipment were legitimately farmed drops. I'd take my my 3* assassins/AA/vats crit gauss any day over my tse gauss. Assassins/sentinels build they gotta move some how. My lvl 170+ with assasins/sentinel just got his rear handed to him by a lvl 38 who popped out of nowhere. Its all about tactics and build and how you implement those tactics with the gear you have. 
---
Ur just a lil late my friend
---
Well, I am NOW.
---
And honestly, with Lead Belly and Cannibal, it's not even that
---
I think it [may have been suggested before](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=decks+-officer&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
---
I was at max caps anyway and needed to get rid of some :)
---
Why is this not a thing?
---
I didn‚Äôt have a chance to. I literally loaded into me dying and the screen that says how long I lived.
---
how do i blueprint them
---
Very cool buy btw!
---
Alright so I redact my previous statement you can blueprint resource collectors with structures and be able to place them exactly where they were before
---
Fermenter = Neat idea, confusingly implemented, with unclear labeling &amp; non-intuitive interface. 
---
Perhaps Redditors can come up with some elegant suggestions for how to fix this?
---
In survival you can only fast travel to stations, vault 76, and your camp. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why these guys were circling the spawn area.
---
I miss replied.  Try the woods around the golf resort in whitesprings.   There is also a big rock near a pond on the golf course itself where I've seen his corpse. 
---
The camouflage is working! 
---
I only remember because I have blueprints for quick setup at workshops.  1 for "defense towers" and one for a crafting area.
---
I have been living next to Site Alpha for a long time (so convenient!) but I'll have to move ASAP if I check out Survival.
---
Yes we who liked Bethesdas games when they where all about a world to  immerse yourself in are really strange. Small things like this are rather proof to me that Beth have lost their touch. They need to start hiring competent people again and not brag about hiring for diversity.
---
Ah - I had searched for ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù and ‚Äúkits‚Äù but not found any.
---
i love the feeling of actually having to watch my back because there‚Äôs always the risk of someone surprising you with a bullet, it keeps things interesting. and the resticted fast traveling is great in my opinion because i like exploring and it encourages to walk and look around more often
---
I think the cap reward/penalty is fine. Before you all go assuming I'm making bank in survival, I was running on a level 30 and constantly getting merc'd. I lost about 1k caps, but its easy enough to earn it back in adventure. Give the people who want to be murder hobos (definitely using that phrase from now on) incentive to stay in survival mode, and not come back to trolling adventure.
---
No no no, make it so only new characters can go in survival mode PLEASE!
---
If your in a town should have emergency broadcast like in Grafton.
---
I'm lvl 190 or something and here is my gear on PC:
---
Armor: http://imgur.com/a/sZzEFVu
---
Weapons: http://imgur.com/a/BB4OhOg
---
The worst of the worst are camping the spawn points for aid drops like that. This one hit the jackpot.
---
I run mostly stealth melee. A non hostile player surprised me the second time I tried the run, and I managed to get on the leaderboard for survival time and was quickly found by someone hunting down leaders.  Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt last long. 
---
Unfortunately you can lose all caps with nontestrictions. I was in a server with a group of people killing each other back and forth for fun and to get those trophies for killing and healing players. 
---
Perhaps it did work yet help never came and that became their only shelter.
---
If I‚Äôm nearby you when it happens, it was probably a mistake trying to just while near you, I did this at least once during the event
---
Otherwise I‚Äôve done it to try and give workshops away before I logout, I once had a low-level guy help me defend a workshop, and I spent the next 10 minutes trying to convince him to team up so I could give it to him and go to bed! 
---
Hahaha, that's a good one!
---
Have my upvote :D
---
Please don't be salty because people don't agree with you.
---
That's right. Fusion cellü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah. I remember that now
---
Why are you so mad? All I did was not agree with you, geez
---
I‚Äôm glad they were
---
at this point, im even surprised people like you expected Bethesda to release something that would actually world and make sense. 
---
next time they release something, just say away for a month or 3 before you try it out. 
---
257?!
---
That sounds like an extreme game breaking bug. You're suppose to get a portion of the aid items from another player, but that sounds like a single death results in your ENTIRE aid inventory getting cleaned out. I was thinking it was going to be something like 1/5th of 5 different aid items would drop from their inventory. 50 stimpacks would result in 10 stimpacks dropped, same ratio for radaway, rad-x, etc. This shit makes it sound like you'll drop every single stimpack you have.
---
Why is your main character a mule
---
I don‚Äôt know about people complaining about what you stated but I get the point of it all.
---
The assholes who destroyed people‚Äôs camps and baited them into a unfair 3 or 4 v 1 matchup will now get to experience their own camps getting leveled without remorse, in a likely unfair matchup.
---
And players like myself that enjoyed actual PvP in workshops or random places on the map will already have their camps strategically placed for survival and have gained a lot more skill from participating in fair challenging matchups, and will thrive in survival.
---
Thing is, those griefer assholes will likely be right back to destroying camps and baiting people in adventure because they won‚Äôt be able to hang in survival.
---
Once camp pacifist mode is implemented they will be a thing of the past.
---
It should show you how to do it when you‚Äôre in build mode. Should show on a bottom bar something like ‚Äúblueprint selection‚Äù 
---
All hood type hats do that. I think it has to do with hoods sharing code with skin-tight hoods like the marine helmet.
---
Is this just in Survival mode?
---
This....Im in the country with shit internet. It will be done by the time I go to bed.
---
This was truly a roller coaster from start to finish
---
Meh imo it's more like: make a specific character with 0 caps and minimal aid items and have at it.  
---
You can regen rads/health with perks, just carry maybe 2 or 3 stimpacks and a couple waters/food, maybe a couple chems tops.  
---
Also, build a bare minimal camp, you don't even need to build anything at all for a camp so long as it's located near workbenches.  All it needs to be is a free travel point and stash access.  
---
But yeah heading into survival with a non pvp optimized/geared character with a ton of caps, aid, and a huge elaborate camps seems like a generally bad call.
---
Balls, I see it now...
---
No more slap damage and no damage to camp if there's still a way to troll I wanna know.
---
Yes Bethesda has lost their touch by saying who killed who in the upper top left screen in a PvP server. This isn't a singleplayer game and you have to give up immersion for information sometimes. If you don't want to then play with your hud transparent
---
Ya this is stupid, I deleted little big planet and now my kids are gonna hate me lol and the entire Witcher complete edition. I have 102 gbs of free space, and somehow I need more 
---
That‚Äôs not an awful idea so when someone goes to take your workshop they can reimburse you!
---
Missclicked and posted gear on thread instead of replying to you
---
Yall hear sumn??
---
Hey there, can you send me a message with your ticket number?
---
New fancy weapons?
---
I'd get it if it was an MMO, but the way Fallout 76 works, as long as 24 people in the world want to do it, they have the same user experience as 24 million. There should be no issues maintaining that ecosystem. 
---
Then, don't respawn there.
---
I mean I travel with a really big inventory of weapons and aids
---
I just got off a server where this was the case. 
---
Killed notifications every few seconds from five or six players killing each other en mass. 
---
Didn't know it was a heavy weapon.
---
Kinda like dark zones in the Division.
---
You know, Vault 51 IS pretty close to the TNT Domes, relatively speaking, and they WERE examining alien tech there...
---
I mean to be fair it‚Äôs been a part of the game since launch. I think the prestige option is Bethesda‚Äôs way of fixing this so I‚Äôm not too worried,  but I understand how some might see it as a punishment for enjoying the game too much and questing on one character since launch.  
---
There are arguments both ways so I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs necessarily wrong for feeling like the odds are stacked against them for using a high level character, but I also recognize the fact that having a lot of hours in a game gives you better gear and resources. It is pretty easy to level a character to 50 and transfer all your PvP gear to them and save 300 caps every time you die tho and I think that‚Äôs the point. 
---
Will do.
---
I feel ya sir...I finally perfected my B.O.S inspired camp just outside Firebase Hancock on the cliff overlooking it...O was super happy with it too...
---
Bum fuck nowhere C.A.M.P. squad for the win! I topped every leaderboard in the first life because there is nowhere you can fast travel to remotely near me. The people trying to go to my position on the map had a long walk nack after they died. (Not an E-peen stroke, C.A.M.P.s can be super broken for survival. My fast travel point is inside a big ass rock so guess where I placed all the turrets...)
---
Yeah, most people call it a "deck" or a "loadout" IME.
---
It's a wonderful idea, but people have been asking for this since BETA and I haven't seen any indication that Bethesda is gonna do it.  Unfortunately.
---
also anything that staggers is good, to hard counter sentinels
---
I can put the yellow hooded rags or the green hood on without facial hair disappearing. And wear glasses with them. Wrapped cap is the only one I‚Äôve come across.
---
Not really. One of the first things you do when you want to heal an infection is to drain the pus. This was just lancing the boil. Now they can focus on making the real game better while the pus eats itself on those other servers.
---
Whomstever downvoted me have a small p e e  p e e
---
Patch noted say that they did something with pvp damage but it said something like nerfing damage, not nerfing defence
---
More like "fancy" but yeah, if you complete a survival weekly challenge you get a named legendary.
---
I just noped out of there and went back to adventure mode for some peaceful building time hehe
---
Good on you for pushing through though. Hope you find pvp more fun than I did! And at least now you‚Äôre more prepared for what to expect!
---
Someone in another thread suggested a "season" mode similar to Diablo 3.  Basically you'd create a new survival character every season, level it/gear it up, and then at the end of the season you could transfer the seasonal character to your regular character.
---
If people can freely move adventure-mode characters to survival, there's always going to be OP characters and it won't be nearly as fun as it could be.
---
Even if characters couldn't be transferred to survival mode, someone who has been playing a survival character for 6 months is clearly going to have a major advantage over someone just deciding to start playing survival with a brand new character.  A seasonal mode would reset that advantage every few months.
---
Damn man have to shoot you in the arm. Lol. 
---
3000 cap yield lol 
---
So about you fixing one hit kills??? Or that grace period for load in???
---
I‚Äôm stuck over encumbered and can‚Äôt even respawn because a guy is using OHK on me before I can load... TWO seconds was my latest attempt at being alive...
---
Yea you are right. I just died and dropped 70 super stimpacks. That was definitely not "some aid items". 
---
I wanted to store most of those stimpack, I was thinking that something like this is going to happen, but I didn't have enough space in stash. 
---
Allow lower levels to join higher servers. You want to boost your buddies lowbie in survival, you take the risk.

They did say Survival mode is Beta folks...calm down and gov Bethesda some ideas....I'd bet they are listening.
---
I agree. I would gladly have more death consequences in this game. Makes people fight harder and grow their skills more.
---
I find it hilarious that its happening too. The get good answers seem to have turned to cries for help. 
---
I'm not calling out OP for that, but I am noticing a large amount complaining about getting killed fast by the same griefers that made pve servers shit sometimes. I'd say a feel bad about this happening but I dont. Keep them all in survival.
---
That's right my bad, I read the patch notes too and forgot. I'm assuming there might be a fix coming soon where you can fast travel to a somewhat "safe" re spawn location or a timer for you to run away lol 
---
*"The people complaining about being camp spawn killed are the same guys that have been using slap damage to kill other players"*
---
Source? or are you just making shit up because some posts offended you? 
---
I do have 5th assasins sentinel piece but I prefer to have chameleon sentinel instead
---
Welcome to the meta buddy
---
Im shook
---
... it's too unrewarding ...
---
... you are loosing quite a lot ...
---
i am lost.
---
You're not funny.
---
Make it so you can join level x-y server. Get notified at y+1, force boot at y+5.
---
No, they don't. AA lever with crit is highly sought after right now.
---
You shouldn't be forced back into adventure to support playing survival. The mode it a failure if it doesn't stand on its own.
---
Probably not, since this is text.
---
I fucking went to a fan fic site and shit my pants thinking this vault had people in it, god damn it.
---
Workshops, and being on a team with people with workshops. Nothing actually really changed, the best gank methods are still there in adventure.
---
Really didn't intend **lolfallout76username** to end up being my username... 
---
I was never able to make it work without the full set, even just missing the helmet I would lose all of the bonuses 
---
Maby that or people brought their big guns to the play ;)
---
Haha well it makes sense why you are wrecking other players. How has the damage change impacted your weapons or do you notice it's similar?
---
I think they just need to change the amount of caps that people past level 50 drop, imo.
---
Neither are typos, they are deadly.
---
This one was fairly close to Whitesprings too, around Middle Mountain Cabins.
---
The guide was probably outdated before you bought it
---
Man, the community on FFXIV was amazing a few years ago. I wasn't on long, just because I couldn't play enough to justify the cost. But while I was on there, people were so willing to help, or give you things, or jump onto a dungeon. I think that's generally what comes with people who choose to pay money to be part of the community versus those who get to play for free. WoW it's just a different community altogether. They've had their own thing going for so long.
---
Yeah there are definitely some people who know. As long as it doesn‚Äôt blow up to the point where it gets changed, I‚Äôll be happy.
---
The durability hit is very real tho. My missile launcher breaks crazy fast. Which, while annoying, is understandable as a trade off.
---
It's still in beta so it is being worked on. 
---
I wasn't using it. I got a kill and realized all the things that dropped is much more severe so I had to stash away my precious items
---
Okay.
---
Still have the workshop contesting. Even if your not taking damage, a guy circling you and hitting you is annoying. Im sure there are other things that the more devious and bored can come up with.
---
Thanks, was really hoping that it was legit and not devroom
---
There's a part of me that can get behind putting all the douchebag players in an isolated server where they can be jerks to each other all day long.
---
But at the same time, this hurts Adventure mode and the game in general.  Once more, Bethesda has thrown out a half-assed, ill-conceived, under-tested piece of work and we'll endure yet another around of critics gloating over it.  And then Bethesda will try to fix it by allocating more, precious resources to a mode that many of us never asked for and have no interest in.
---
You gotta active it 
---
The flip side to this is that in previous Fallout games, you had no option to enable/disable perks at will.
---
FO4 has no level cap, so ‚Äúgod mode‚Äù characters would eventually have all perks active all the time...this poses an obvious problem in an online game, so there needed to be a different system.
---
Prior to the release of DLCs, FO3 had a level cap of 35 (?). This meant that your Perk choices were locked in, and there were plenty that your character would never get to use.
---
FO76 has no level cap, but also no ‚Äúgod mode‚Äù characters, so it‚Äôs clear that neither of the two systems listed above were going to work, and something new was needed. 
---
I‚Äôve seen many posts from people who want some perks to be ‚Äúpassive‚Äù, so that you don‚Äôt have to have the card equipped to gain the benefit, negating the need to swap cards in and out...I believe this undermines the whole system.
---
I‚Äôve seen many more posts from people suggesting ‚Äúkits‚Äù or ‚Äúloadouts‚Äù  as a compromise, but considering that you could‚Äôve ended up being locked in to your choices as you made them, I feel that the ability to swap cards in and out at will IS the compromise.
---
Rejoin server, you gotta go to a newly gray area named ‚Äúfraternity row‚Äù or something
---
Well, that's a different company and game entirely, so I'm not sure if I see your point?
---
Thank you I'll add monstermash to my list of farming events. I already know AWOL.  Used to farm it before they dropped the legendary rate 
---
That‚Äôs some serious bullshit 
---
A lvl 38 taking out a lvl 150+
---
Yeah that‚Äôs balanced 
---
I'm down next to bridge by Sunshine Meadows. I don't think would be a good spot in Survival either. Too exposed.
---
Been thinking of moving anyway. I've been having more and more issues with the CAMP not being able to be placed. Too popular a spot.
---
Idk why your comment gets downvoted. I havent tried the survival but  i might do it later. I just dont feel like losing big amounts of caps atm. Idk why ppl would complain when they get killed in survival mode. Like its a pvp server, if u dont like to be killed just go back to adventure mode.. 
---
But you got the 20% XP bonus, right?
---
I am not sure what a QOL is, but yes I am looking for specific guides on many quests that I have read that someone around my level should be able to do without much trouble (like the mistress of mystery).  I am unsure as to why I am having the issues with completing such quests, unless I am just too low of a level to do most things
---
I did not notice any difference really. Players in power armor are still 1-2 shot with handmade and 1 shot with shotgun. Some cavalier/sentinel + assasins players were a bit harder to kill but it just takes enforcer or crit hits to get trougth that.
---
I'm off tomorrow  and on est so just let me know
---
Word dude - that‚Äôs p fucked
---
...And this is another reason why being able to jump over to Adventure mode is good- Jump there, go build a camp or unlock few train stations. Problem solved.
---
I'm not being forced. I generally dont enjoy pvp. Just doing survival to try to get the weekly gun and a little bonus xp. Hoping around events, and when they end its usually a murder spree that I lose. Did get the last laugh kill on one of them, highlight of my survival play time.
---
Duped? Probably? I‚Äôm only level 177, and have played every day since launch. I have earned/farmed every explosive weapon, every two shot, everything I have I have earned myself. I have NEVER seen, or earned an Assassins/Sentinel armor piece. What does that mean? I don‚Äôt know. Just saying. 
---
Was it a legendary without a star? It may need to be one with at least one star. I also just got 3 from uranium fever
---
Of course, all worth it.
---
I can safely say I speak for the 10 or so people I know who bought this game, and have since sold their copies.
---
I lasted longer playing than most of them, I kept telling them "it'll get better, they just need to iron out performance" over and over.
---
You can only say that sort of thing so many times before you sound like an idiot shill.
---
Hey there! [Check out this support article](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43862/kw/lag) and see if it resolves your issue. If it doesn't you [can file a ticket here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for us to further investigate.
---
Lol, absolutely no offense to you but this is why I did not have fun when I tried out the new mode. Not having the reduce damage types of armor will greatly diminish chances of kills. Time to start farming for armor again! I lost a bleep ton of caps and aid. 
---
By the way dupes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlike everything else‚Äù 
---
They are fucking dupes.  Cheaters gain major advantages for no good reason.  Sounds like fun! 
---
Separate stashes would be great too.  Weapons. Heals. Armor. Clothes. Food.
---
Because with the right perks your aid is all but weightless, letting you use your limited stash for holding Junk. And since in adventure mode you drop junk and don't drop aid, it was a better way to balance your load.
---
I'm gona have to sell or stash a ton of aid before I go survival. Maybe I'll switch my perks to lighten weapons and keep junk and aid in my stash.
---
Exactly just google what you need,  I‚Äôve never understood buying these game guides.
---
Because you‚Äôre calling me a liar that‚Äôs why. And btw, just for shits and giggles I went and recorded a video on my phone. However, I‚Äôm still pretty new to reddit and don‚Äôt know how to post it for you to see. If you know how, I‚Äôll gladly post both of them to prove you wrong. 
---
I think you answered your own question there lol. 
---
Blueprints are not very efficient. You can't blueprint much and they are hard to place down often if you have any sort of elaborate or medium- large build
---
I havent used PA for a while but i guess its aluminium  springs, screws and steel and other junk
---
how would he survive for a long time without killing the players hunting him?
---
Seems random but I‚Äôve killed players and they dropped 100+ nuka colas and super stimpacks and 20+ of other chems, I can‚Äôt imagine they were carrying a lot more than that so sometimes you drop most aid it seems.
---
Do u get money for just staying alive
---
I can see it now the ‚ÄúEverything Atom Bundle‚Äù  for 20k atoms and your left testicle. Women will be spared of the latter.

Sure. I'll be on later tonight. IGN: jchamlin

Yes let‚Äôs blame the victims instead of taking steps to prevent the douchebags taking advantage of an obvious bug. That logic is beautiful mate. I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs taken you far in life.
---
No you kill people for money. 
---
Idk about the dependability of the server though. I mean I know nothing of the future but after yesterday‚Äôs crash with Bethesda accounts on both the Web and 76 I‚Äôm just not sure how the servers will hold up if Bethesda is adding more services to that same server in the future. But again idk I‚Äôm not a Bethesda executive nor a fortune teller. But I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll put in a 2nd server for survival anytime soon. They might save it for private servers instead and just tweak survival from what they‚Äôve got now 
---
It does, can confirm.

This constant talk of a 'level playing field' is bullshit.   It was never going to be a level playing field, no matter what.  Had everyone started with new characters, within  mere hours, you would have level 20's one shotting level 2's. 
---
In a week you'd have level 100's one-shotting level 20's.   Seriously, what difference do you really think it makes?   
---
Well I just had a 3* bloated one drop a drill so that's at least one thing developers could have been working on that they obviously can't find time for.
---
I'm not much of a programmer but updating the loot pool seems like it would be fairly easy to have the isntern take care of.
---
It drops in the paper bag for someone to pick up.
---
On PC.
---
Bug: I've been killed twice now within a second of spawning, before I even got control of my character.
---
I don't know to do that either but if you got evidence then I will believe you, I would give it to Bethesda as well so they can fix the bug.
---
well i just created a new character for the new mode since i was sitting on 400 stimpaks and a couple thousand caps and losing them wasnt worth the risk, i‚Äôm really enjoying it on a new char so far. exactly, the whole point was to move pvp to another game mode and people should just deal with it since they have the choice of not playing it
---
Yup, ive had them go on for days on end
---
Exact. Big icon on map of where you are. I got 3rd today just running around doing lowbie events, not killing anyone. Don't believe that is worthy of the kill me beacon.
---
Think of it as a tourist guide book. It won't give you a walkthrough or show you everything available.  However, it will let you know what's possible for cities, locations for power armor spawn points. If you enjoy sitting back from the game, and getting prepared for what might be coming your way, then consider it. Also comes in handy when you NEED a supply of one component, I tend to open the bugger up just to see if they mention the possibility of acid, lead, or such.
---
QOL stands for Quality of Life. It may be wiser to grind some levels, tagging mobs at whitespring is a good way to skimp a level or 2 for a mission where you arent quite high enough.
---
Another good quick leveling tactic is to follow a high level player in the bog, and either make friends and kill stuff together or tag their kills, youll get some ridiculous XP that way and also feel the danger of being in one of the end game environments prematurely
---
Especially with a game that's constantly changing.
---
People need to stop telling people what they can or can't say. 
---
Haven't encountered this on Survival yet but I understand 100%. When loading into areas on Adventure, I've took damage from enemies while my screen was on the black screen right after the load screen, and if it takes to long or doesn't immediately react to your inputs you stand there and get hit. I feel a 7 sec invulnerability time when spawing into the area should exist, but at the same you shouldnt be able to attack as to (theoretically) not cannot abuse the anti spawn damage as a way to run to a post, wait for the timer to wear off,  then start firing instantly.
---
Yeah had that too but it fixed itself.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking someone was telling me silver or something? I dunno I have lots of stuff like copper/rubber/etc that I‚Äôm not sure if it would be used or not. I just need some room. 
---
Just like the simulations
---
I've talked with my so about a tent, that would be the dream! I love my camp as a base, a tent would be so great. 
---
Non taken. I grinded and traded my ass off for that gear because I knew pvp servers were coming. Without that stuff I would have been broke after tonigth.
---
This is an article refering to lag, what i'm experiencing is rubber banding. Lagging makes the game runs slow, rubberbanding teleports me back because the game thinks i'm in a different location.
---
And they can't fix it for at least a week.  Another 4Gb teabag, incoming.
---
Probably some vats crits by an AA gun 
---
i read stuff of ppl waiting at spawn points killing ppl before they are fully loaded.. I will wait till beth fixes that issue 
---
I think the best thing is to find a friend thats higher level. Especially one of those 100+ guys that literally have nothing but time and experience when playing. 
---
Are you on survival?
---
Silver and plastic maybe, 
---
I've seen posts where people in assassins and cavalier armor complaining about being one-shot killed too, after going into the game thinking that their build was the meta for survival mode.   
---
Bethesda's done some re-balancing, apparently. 
---
Someone earlier posted their screenshot, showing their last life lasted 3 seconds.
---
What are you talking about you only have to drink 76 beers in one day!
---
Seriously though, whoever set the numbers for some of the daily challenges was clearly incredibly watered.
---
Are they even still alive?
---
#BethesdaCoverUp
---
Yeah I'm not seeing a balance to Sentinels and Cavalier. The problem isn't with players being one shotted its with players not fucking dying. 
---
The only people making caps in survival are dupers 
---
I saw something about survival mode a week or two back and I didn't have time to read up at the time. Was really hoping for a more hardcore PvP experience. Am very let down.
---
I'd love to see a mode where you can make progression on your character's levels, but ultimately you need to operate out of your camp and *really* survive. Let your STASH be your safe spot and otherwise have full looting. If you're a heavy you'll find yourself hauling 2 or 3 miniguns back to camp so that you can store them for if / when you die.
---
As-is I don't think I'll bother reinstalling. I haven't really played since a couple weeks after launch; I'd be so far behind the curve I'd just get merc'ed over and over again.
---
Which is caused by lag. When the connection between your computer and the server is slow, your in-game position is not updated properly, and as a result you are moved back to the position where the server last had you located. 
---
Any chance that dodgy is draining your AP?
---
Wait, is the limb damage different from FO4? In that, that legendary didn't do more health damage, just more limb damage.
---
No it isnt that simple, this is not single player game. Fallout 76 with 24 players is nothing like fallout 76 with 24 000 players. With 24 players, you don't have markets, communities, no one really gives a sh#t what you do inside the game or what gear you have- that right there is a single player game. What people want from Online game is to progress their character, trade better gear with other player, be part of something more than just 24 players, want to show other players what gear they have.
---
It's not much but \~50 caps ain't bad. Just make sure you kill more than you die. I'm playing on a low level character but he's getting good xp in there.
---
Also the special item is awarded for 25 legendary kills a week.
---
[https://imgur.com/o4fbO7A](https://imgur.com/o4fbO7A)
---
100 is max claim cost and I can confirm that. The problem is that only works if you're low level enough. There's also no accounting for people that don't do PvP for caps.
---
I‚Äôve thought about that, but don‚Äôt like he idea of being carried through the game so I can level up faster.  I‚Äôm playing solo because I really wanted a solo fallout game, and my life schedule only allows solo play
---
Hopefully it still exists, I‚Äôm hoping they extend the debuff to anyone that‚Äôs on your team aswell when the debuff is active. 
---
Did it notify you that you made the leaderboard? Or did you have to check constantly that you were in the top 3?
---
You act like a passive-aggressive dick. Don't be mad, all I am doing is stating a fact.
---
Gimmie back my junk! 
---
I love getting one shot by a party of lvl 100 somethings who spawn camp me while they tell me I dont belong here go back to ez mode. Definitely fun 
---
I'm not blaming you, I'm telling you that their is a solution to your problem.
---
That is just one example. And it is impossible to feel any immersion when there is a message there spamming all the time. Even with HUD off there is still the "swoosh" sound. Also even the fact that you can't even choose what to turn off in the HUD is really bad, most games these days allow you to customize the HUD and turn off individual elements you don't want. 
---
What the game thinks it's worth. Charisma is your important stat here as it effects vendor prices. At least use the hard bargain perk and some grape mentats. If your char doesn't have high charisma find some unyielding armor, doesn't matter what sort, give yourself a massive radiation dose so you're nearly dead. The armor will give you a massive charisma boost which will bring prices down.
---
My current camp is right up the road from the Overseer's camp, across the street from Gauley mine. I built there expressly because I wanted to see new players, fresh from the vault, and show them my bar themed camp. I'm loving it so far, even though it's more expensive to fast travel from than the more sensibly located center of the map.
---
If you're not doing pvp, go to Adventure Mode. That's literally the whole point.
---
If you want the danger of survival mode, then don't complain about being hunted down. 
---
Ok.  I don‚Äôt want to be told what to do, but yes would like a guide that give general advice and tips.  And yes, I do like to play games like this....that whole ‚Äúfeeling remotely prepared‚Äù thing.  Thank you so much for responding 
---
It's been working , I been pairing it with concentrated fire to counter bloodied sentinel builds
---
It‚Äôs fucked. They answer puff comments and questions and have completely ignored the large majority of people voicing major concerns with being able to use your main character in Survival. It‚Äôs BS. There was a very easy fix here ‚Äî Start off new. 
---
Is there some kind of special trick to it? Do you have to line it up just right or is it something procedural like you have to select the harvester first/last in the blueprinting process?
---
As good as a dildo made out of sand
---
Maybe that could be another mode. Something similar to this, but everyone joins and pairs up in different factions
---
Can you elaborate? 
---
Honestly Ive started reporting people traah talking and spawn camping the stations 
---
Yeah I've done my fair share of grinding for armor but pvp is probably not for me, I like the unyielding build and and sentinel or caveliers is very hard to find or trade for. Good to see there's positive vibes on the new update. I've been playing since beta and experienced all the features this game has had to offer. 
---
What platform you on
---
Hey you can‚Äôt say that
---
Those armors never protected you from being 1 shot. That is not how they work. Those armors loose effectiveness as damage increases. Always thought it was a waste of caps. Pvp has always been rocket tag.
---
I would agree except they put that stupid timer that highlights you on the map if you actually survive long enough. 
---
The idea of the mode is great but the timer and no locked characters, well, and the cap bonus for killing is ridiculous.
---
No, you just have to position the blueprint to where the resource collector is in the general position it normally is in and it should work
---
Disable fast travel at all 
---
True, the drill is such a wasted new weapon. If i spit at my monitor i bet i could do more damage to an enemy, completely worthless
---
God I love all the salt of people playing a open pvp mode. Wtf did you expect was going to happen? 
---
I got 1 shot by invisible TSE marsupial griefers 
---
Thanks for telling me, dam that sucks. I comment and read comments because I still learn from people and their builds. That sucks it don't stack, I almost thought, I should be a gun runner speed demon but wouldn't of been happy if they don't stack.
---
Then let me be clear on what I meant, sorry about that.
---
I am not lagging when it occurs. It just teleports me, like if I try to stand on top of the mining machine in a "breach and clear" event. 
---
Moon jumping?
---
There is a difference between stash size and naming items, the stash size (even increased by a single pound) can hold hundreds of items (ammo, magazines etc.) while adding names to weapons would be saving a line of text applied to a weapon.
---
How many people you got? Wanna merge with protos?
---
I asked for thoughts...that means discussion.I think you have a problem with reading comprehension.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt protect direct nukes or the blast but I doubt they even stopped radiation. Not to mention how long that person would have to stay in it for the fallout to clear.
---
Big blinking dot not cool 
---
If you want, here is mine. I only know this because I am unable to hear the clip, since it already plays in my head 24/7.
---

---
Additionally, life saw fit to through eastern common kadydids in there for good measure (Fifth speaker down). 
---
https://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/buzz/141a.htm
---
Imagine the two together and you have it.
---
This feels like BS‚Ä¶ you seriously lost THAT many aid items. Damn. 
---
is AP supposed to drain if you're still moving forward in the air on a high jump? that doesn't seem right 
---
It'd probably be the hardest having a 'good guy' faction because literally any rando can stab you in the back. Meanwhile others could just shoot first and not worry if the other guys is hostile or not
---
Source? Reddit. Today. A large majority of posts here today, once Survival went live, were pretty much about being one shotted, spawn killed, unfair advantage posts. None of it offended me, if anything I found it amusing. Go back an re-read what I posted, there's no offence or beating on my chest there. Sorry if that's how you saw it.
---
On the bright side adventure is peachy
---
Man I had 7000 .50 rounds when I fought the queen and that shit was gone within minutes. I spent days making all that ammo. Real life days. I moved my camp to the ash region next to a lead deposit for 14 lead at a time. I couldn‚Äôt believe how fast I burned through it.
---
Leaping like x10 times higher than possible, and no, I do not mean jetpacking...these dudes weren't even in power armour
---
yeah i heard about that as well and i‚Äôve seen it myself, along with the huge amount of aid items you drop on death. i‚Äôll just try to completely avoid vault 76 and most popular stations like whitespring until that‚Äôs fixed. i‚Äôll still play the mode since i‚Äôve done everything there is to do in adventure
---
I think this.
---
I just make sure my junk collection is balanced.. like some materials are 0.1 lbs each so i keep it to 100 max, other materials are 0.05 each so i keep it to 200 and stuff thats 0.03 each i keep to 150. everything that gets above those limits gets bulked and is  sold to vendors. Its just managing your stash.  For example th ere is no need of keeping 2000 steel scrap because it will take alot of inventory space and steel is easy to find.  
---
I'm mixed on this. Obviously the best strategy to start is go into adventure, drop all junk &amp; aid into your stash, spend all your caps, fast travel to an out-of-the way location like the space-station or something, and then switch to survival.
---
But since the survival mode does not have fast travel but to the vault, train stations, and your camp, that means you have to hoof-it anywhere you want to be. Want to go to survival to get extra bonus XP at white springs or watoga? all the PvPers will be there. Want to nuke prime and have a queen battle with +20% on your xp? I'm sure that place will be hit by a handfull of fatmen as soon as the SBQ dies.
---
They hadn‚Äôt any stars, so that could be the difference. Thank you!
---
Marsupial perhaps?
---
Just spawn at your camp
---
I bought it assuming I could replace both types of purifiers since it pictured one and said the other. Also I can't seem to use the variant toggle while building to switch types. You have to deconstruct and reconstruct with the new skin.
---
^this. How out of touch are you in the game to label every explosive weapon as a TSE. When BEs and AAEs dominate the market ... these kids still talking about getting killed by ‚ÄúTSEs‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs like my grandma trying to explain how her and her sister had to share 2 pairs of underwear growing up, or walking 15 miles ea direction to school.
---
He's literally complaining about being put on the leaderboars for doing nothing but not die and says he doesn't fault the players, but how leaderboard players are determined.
---
It's almost like you didnt read the whole post.
---
Had a game where 3 nukes were on white springs. I killed so many ghouls that day hahah
---
This is hotfix worthy. It's way to broken and it's going to kill the new game mode before it even gets a chance to start
---
The friend thing is pretty shitty and something I thought of when the first mentioned not being able to see players and that. What's to stop people from inviting you to their team then kicking you and killing you. 
---
I know it's a beta and I'm not going to be that troll that bashes Bethesda for no good reason. But all the issues people have been having, from god builds to exploiters and now this, makes me think Bethesda has no direction for surivival
---
In 2 months time i would like an option to opt into a newer survival pool, and two months after that i would like another...
---
I manage ti get my hands on a TSE back before the nerfs, and it was my favorite, then I put it away and after many attempts of selling it, still have it and I am so glad I still have it, I will start using it again
---
At least you are not spawning on mines left by people on spawn points.  Yeah the invincibility  should be there, but nope its not.  
---
Other fun things i have seen is placing camp turrets near train stations for spawn camping by 3 to 4 people covering all exits.
---
 Do not forget to mention baiting players with bounty rewards on your friends which means its 4 against 1 when other players show up.  
---
Camping outside vault 76 is apparently the new trend.
---
Artillery strikes from camps can ignore spawn invulnerability sometimes.
---
I could go on, but hey its a beta.  It should be done by the time fallout 5 comes around.
---
Download the Xbox app on your phone and report them through there 
---
Try restarting your router and/or Xbox that usually fixes it for me
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion but....‚Äù God, you‚Äôre awful! Let people enjoy the things they like and move on 
---
Depends on the part and if it uses 1 of all crafting materials to repair.
---
Possible list is: Aluminum, Black titanium, Copper, Circuitry, Gear, Glass, Nuclear material, Oil, Rubber, screw, Silver, Spring, Steel
---
Don't knock camel toe.....
---
Geez someone came up..
---
I got one shotted by some unyielding cavalier power fist today so it was cool. My point of this post was however that there are just too many caps involved in killing and dying. I seriously felt quilty after I got maxed in caps after few hours what would have taken 3-4 days of vendoring.
---
That‚Äôs kinda on you for jumping into something that drops some aid items on death with a shit ton of aid items. What did you expect? 
---
I just keep looking for legendaries and set up shop. Somehow i dont get bored of it. Once i get all the stuff i need i might join the survival mode
---
I agree, I just wish it was another week longer as I was only able to play twice.  A+ for originality and the cool masks!
---
Probably marsupial boosted by strange in numbers. It gets ridiculous. Combined with the snowfall from bird bones, you can stay in the air for a while.
---
I was having tons of fun till I ran into a spawn point camper who kept instantly killing me as soon as I spawned in. That timer is pretty much non existent.
---
Marsupial with stranger in numbers and jacked up on chems will do it ;) this Survival mode sounds intense, gonna try it later! 
---
Well, i think OP camp design is better than mine, but watching a few of Jug Ross videos gave me a few nice tricks. 
---
Like, now what i do when i start building a new camp, i put a fondation on the higher ground, add a wall on opposite side from csmp center. Add the flat roof part again and again to make a straight line. Add wall to the last roof part until i get near the ground. Finish that with a fondation.
---
Now the fun part begin. Remove everything except the two fondations. More fondations can be added. But not really needed. I use two on the lower ground and put a normal stair in the middle. I build wall around the two fondations and begin using upperfloor from the stairs. So i build two stories that will connect to the fondation on the higher ground.
---
That's all.
---
Yea it is wild out there :D
---
I got it as a gift and at this point it's only useful for the maps of various areas. Any stats have been nerfed/patched, and some stuff in the guide isnt even applicable anymore.
---
Still, i appreciated it as a gift. It's the heardcover one so i use it for my Vault Dweller cosplay.
---
Moon jumping = marsupial and bird bones
---
"Infinite healing" = healing factor, life saving armor, stimpacks, blood packs, nuke grape, or many other things. 
---
It probably isnt hacks... you just died too quick to figure out what they were doing.
---
I'm farming for aid in survival mode. There's plenty of people testing their metal that aren't very prepared for what's waiting for them. They carry lots of aid. LOTS
---
I had to check. 
---
Marsupial with strange in numbers. Get a mutant team of 4 and you can jump 50 plus feet in the air. Not hacking 
---
This is the general response you get from the PvP fanatics. Don't get me wrong if you like PvP thats cool, I like the idea too. But these guys who think it's ok to be able to run a god build and spawn trap a noob over and over are ass holes. Plain and simple 
---
Damn I spent money on this too before reading it would be missing the only reason it was pump shotty
---
Thank you for the update! I‚Äôll probably be avoiding Survival completely. PvP isn‚Äôt something I seek out, and know that I would die too frequently
---
And it's not just armor. I'm seeing stealth/ sniper types who easily destroyed opponent in adventure mode workshop fights that are now complaining about how their damage has been nerfed.  Or that's my understanding of it. Like I said I don't play survival, I'm just reading the complaints about it here.  You say power armor in PVP is a mistake, but I'm seeing non PA builds who thought they were ready for this getting wrecked.
---
I thought it said you were immune to damage for some time after fast travel or loading in unless you attacked. Is that not true? At work still so I cannot play.
---
I had lots of fun too. Created a new character, got killed once by a high level but that was it. Afterwards I only found people my level. I got in a firefight with one guy but greeded and stayed with my claimed loot. A few minutes later he snuck up on me and got revenge!
---
Also found a friendly person who helped with an event. Very fun and tense, because you dont want to turn your back on then if they changed their mid/acting to earn my trust. Makes it more wholesome when it works too because mutual trust is needed, which is nice.
---
Thanks for this, Any idea what the respawn rate of the filing cabinets are?
---
Are you good at pvp?
---
ive been having similar issues. i find that it happens when you use a weapon that you have multiple ones in your inventory. example i use a missile launcher if i find ammo for it, but if i pick up another missile launcher  while using it i tend to rubber-band a lot. it seems to stop when i change weapons.
---
&gt;!same issue happens when i use any harpoon gun, despite not having two in my inventory!&lt;
---
Oh yeah for sure.  I was on the other end where I lost like 4k trying to compete. Lol little nerfing on caps and i would not mind trying again
---
3/4 is still "some".
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 151 with a stealth rifle build with decent dmg without using exploits, joined in survival and about 15 minutes in found a 84 player and decided to take them out, well did zero damage to them after 5 shots and got destroyed by a TSE shotty 2 shot. Still confused, anyone encounter this yet
---
Btw tried to make a new character, save y‚Äôall some time don‚Äôt do this. It becomes dark souls 2.0 
---
Yeah haha
---
Would it be better to use adventure mode for quests (adventure) and survival mode for extreme shit?
---
I started a new character joined level 2 survival. Was at white springs before hopping to survival server. Spawn camping at white springs railroad is too real. Lol. Some poor bloke lost all his aids and 2k caps
---
You lost some, which is probably based on amount. Kinda annoying honestly.
---
Hopefully not. I'm having a blast!
---
Question‚Ä¶ if you have aid items in your STASH, are they safe, is it just the ones in your active inventory? Or does it pull from your whole stash?
---
GT claycalebrissy  Still not sure about the survival server, but I am interested in potentially joining a non griefer group.
---
To the two dupers flying around using explosive harpoons calling everyone the n-word.
---
The smallest
---
Valuable stuff? Since when are aid items valuable stuff? 
---
No need. You clearly ain't even player who plays survival mode, you are adventure mode player. Survival Mode player would already have camp that is meant to be for survival mode, not some "decorative" camp in some useless location.
---
Yep, didn't work for me. Tried freakin everything, trust me. Well, except surgery.
---
Mole miners and super mutants are good sources of xp and loot. Clear out the Grafton steel mill, the dam.... scratch that. Just go hog wild in the whole toxic valley. Then head down to the ashlands and tear the place up. Welch, lewisberg, crawl through some mines.
---
And do events. Any of them. All of them. Every event has a chance to reward a 1 star legendary piece of armor. Hoard events have a 3 star boss. Plus they give you tons of supplies like ammo, stimpacks and radaway and water. You'll be stocked up in no time. Less time farming for basic supplies means more time getting xp, right? 
---
There's a debate about doing quests on the way up or waiting till level 50 so you can get the higher level rewards. I say do em as you go. By the time you hit 50 you'll be looking for better stuff than the quests give you. The rewards will be of more benefit to you on the way up. So bang out those quests, too.
---
Taking workshops has been a little sketchy with the possibility of PVP but with the new survival mode and changes to pacifist they might return as good sources of xp and supplies. Those defend events are pretty easy and happen pretty regularly. If you get a couple of workshops going you can keep busy. I wouldn't put this under how to level up quick but I include it as general advice. 
---
Once you feel comfortable, start poking your head into the savage divide. Or take your friend and trek through the big bend tunnel together. Check out whitesprings at some point.
---
Beta may mean testing but it sure as hell doesn't mean it should be a broken mess.
---
Good news all around.
---
Well what are yours?
---
I can't even sign into my Xbox account.
---
You‚Äôre all wrong, the guy was using strange in numbers with either cavaliers or sentinels armor (15% damage avoided while running / standing still per piece) and possibly assassins (8% damage avoided per piece) which makes them near impossible to kill, if you‚Äôre using explosive weapons he had a dense chest mod (I believe 45% explosive damage resistant) and fire proof max rank (45% explosion resistance) there are plenty more things you could add to this build making you indestructible, my best advice is to not go in survival till you have this + a perfect build (no charisma or QoL builds) for PvP.
---
thats not some thats most.
---
You want to head on over to a destinatiin, but you don't want to be blasted into a million pieces?
---
Exit Survival, go to Adventure, go to that destination, exit Adventure, go back into Survival
---
Did you happen to be sniping from a three at Whitespring?
---
There should be a last minute notification of the blast zone, say 30-45 seconds, you can't fast travel out of it but must seek shelter or leave the zone. The blast should be larger then the actual zone that is left
---
What exactly is good at pvp? It's just a one shot fest of whoever can have the best gimmick.
---
&gt;This provides an unnatural incentive to become a murder hobo in a setting that is supposed to just be tense when meeting others.
---
 Do you honestly think people weren't going to go to that server just to murder others? 
---
 They let everybody who is already completed every single quest in the game go over to this server where there's nothing else to do but kill other people.
---
 It's an absolute joke that they allowed mode swapping.
---
 In the age of battle Royal kiddies this is what you get when you open servers up to full on PVP.
---
I've seen people say that the amount lost is random everytime. If that's the case then that's really stupid. Imagine someone kills you and you drop 100 stimpacts, you kill him back and he only drops 10. Your feel pretty pissed 
---
Yea but you made a clear accusation that the people complaining are the 'same guys' that have been using slap damage to kill other players. That's a pretty sweeping statement to make with zero evidence. Why would you even write such a thing?
---
Counter-example, I wrote a post describing my first engagement and being 1-shot. It wasn't meant as a complaint exactly, but one little illustration of what I've expected all along-- that this mode would be a gongshow. And I have never killed anyone with slap damage or otherwise tried to screw with players. 
---
I really don't get why some people here are generalizing the shit out of the authors of critical posts.
---
Or two given my appetite 
---
lol I spawned in and #3 was waiting at the spawn point
---
So what was the outcome?  all these people banned or was it just server side errors?
---
Well put
---
peoples views are different i see some who want a gta spin off others want a call of duty then there the ones who wanted rpg.
---
To each their own. A good game is one where all players can find a common ground
---
Me run in with axe. Me smash.
---
It's a lot more fun that way, but I had to go and look online what this damn recon scope they were telling me to use was. I'd completed it 5 times before I had even known to pick up the plans for one. And I assume it weighs like 10lb or something so scope be damned I'ma smash.
---
Sshhhhhhheeeeeeiiiiiitttttt. SHOW.
---
they probably are safe. but i expected to lose maybe 1/10th or up to 1/4th of all my aid, fair enough.
---
about 3/4th is way to much for me to find any enjoyment in it though
---
My favorite part was watching everyone run ahead and leave one bot behind to get creamed by a suicider because I'm a terrible shot.
---
Dang. More like‚Ä¶ where dem Raiders at! I need a gang. 
---
Yes. With the new pvp damage limits there is going to be a meta shift. Where does damage taper off? What weapon can get us closest to it?
---
xbox itself is down
---
I have read some post about ppl getting killed before they are loaded. So maybe its bugged idk. I havent done the survival mode myself. But reading stuff like that makes me stay away from it for a while. Its still a beta. And bethesda isnt good with beta stuff XD
---
I just found this link because I found a broadsider and was wondering if it was any good. I do have to admit this stream has kept me from getting back at it. Thanks guys. Now I realize I need to get alot higher than lv 31. 
---
i took some of my higher stacks as base value, i had 39 radaways and after that one death only 9 are left.
---
so yeah thats a one-and-done deal for me.
---
No I fully expected it, but it does not need the added incentive of making it extremely profitable.
---
This didn't happen, please tell me this isn't true. 
---
Berry mentats kill them and take their stealth boys and you too can be invisible.
---
Lots of people having the issue.  Go to system and do a full restart.  
---
Not an option for everyone? For example since until today the aid tab wasn't something anyone ever had to worry about I've personally been abusing the hell out of traveling pharmacy to hold what would otherwise be over 1500lbs of chems. Since that isn't fitting in a stash box my only options if I want to play this mode are to junk thousands of meds and chems that I can otherwise still use in Adventure or lose them all on my first Survival death. 
---
thats the only problem i have right now, i knew i could lose some items on death, as bethesda has worded themselves. but losing 3/4th of all my aid carried (and i carry alot of food and such) is kind of bullshit.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll do that and see if we can hook up soon. Thanks for the assist.
---
Also I saw way too much aid items in paper bags after kills. Like seriously 100 stimpacks, 50 psycho, 10 glowing stakes and 30 buffouts in one bag. There is no way that is reasonable.
---
Place poster in camp, if you got it from the atom shop. If not, you gotta find it in the world. Just read the poster to start the quest.
---
How do you even store that much acid? If I get like 300 of any material I'm like opps better sell 150 of it.
---
&gt; virtually no recoil
---
Ah. I see you‚Äôve never met my trigger discipline.
---
...but in those survival game you can also find the max weapon in single house.
---
If you win more than you lose, survival will make you caps. If you lose a lot in pvp on survival, you need to find an "I want to work" sign and go to morgantown to beg for caps.
---
100% this. Neither aesthetically pleasing nor tactically beneficial, everything looks like toys bought from Ikea. Imagine Heckler Koch paints all their firearms red with a big logo stamped on the sides. Actually I‚Äôd rather take the HK red than this vaultech pseudo branding. 
---
Trade with players. I buy items for cheap and try to make a profit. It takes some patience but you'll make a lot of caps
---
It‚Äôs in the post 
---
^an example of someone who isn‚Äôt good at pvp
---
That‚Äôs the solution?
---
I don't think it's an awful decision, but not a particularly useful one either. It might be cooler if being in the top 3 earned some kind of bonus over time, so that maintaining that lead becomes important and a bit of a cat and mouse chase game. 
---
Cool I‚Äôll invite you 
---
Or simply require the owner to consent (fight back) to PvP. If they do not consent, they lose the workshop.
---
Not working for me as well. Already tried the good ol unplug and wait
---
Same stuff it costs to make it 
---
"I'm sorry I just threw a grenade into the train station, I thought I was looking at my stash"
---
Why am I getting "unable to connect to Bethesda.net" after upgrading game today on Xbox 1?
---
Not really, besides all duped items were removed
---
Almost all of my caps come from aid items sold to vendors so....
---
Why is everyone begging for more things to buy when we still don‚Äôt have basic functional decorations ( armor stands/gun racks etc)?
---
Searching glowing dead gives the radioactive stuff most of the time, regardsless if you killed them. The golfclub after someone has had a nukezone frenzy is a goldmine.
---
I love this idea. this would be epic.. We need 1 house settlement and a camp.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue. A full hard reset or whatever did not fix the problem for me.
---
Yup, sums it up.
---
It will likely be added when player vending is added. 
---
But no official response on when they will add it.
---
How can one be headshot, if one has no head?
---
Yea, same here. Lost like 70 of Super Stimpacks. idk, if I am mad about it. I mean I have now something to collect, but...that was not "some aid items" like they told :D
---
Here‚Äôs my criticism: there was a nuke dropped at whipesprings. Nothing out of the ordinary. However, when people tried to fast travel to the nearest point (whitesprings station) they were met by 2 people literally just aiming at the spawn point. As soon as someone loaded in, they were met with nothing but hellfire from tse automatic weapons. Dead within mere seconds. This is an obvious bug. Maybe make stations safe zones? But ONLY the train stations.
---
Nobody believes you, go away.
---
I know is my problem, never said the opposite. I just thought you could lose a few, not that crazy amount.
---
Same as above, Live seems to be down, and FO76 isn‚Äôt installed anymore on mine.
---
It would also be nice to know where the top 3 guys with kills were cause then we know where not to go
---
I hope you realize PvP is not the same thing as griefing. Griefing is I follow you from server to server, destroy your camp, and whack you with a buzz blade so you can't fast travel. PvP can be those things, but it could also just be people going to PvP events and PvP zones.
---
But I guess you can have your moment and think the guys that caused you trouble are gone. I guarantee you there's still going to be people trolling on adventure mode because that's who their original targets were to begin with - people that want to be left alone.
---
Xbox servers are down. Only affected some people.
---
I like mythbusters but haven't seen that episode
---
Mythbusters set off a nuke?
---
Okay...thanks!
---
No, just the vast majority of the people complaining.
---
It‚Äôs dissapointing how fast this game turned into gta online. 
---
All part of the brutality of survival mode
---
Not everyone that PvPs is a douche on the mic. (Some are,  inevitably)
---
If you're getting spawn camped, spawn somewhere else. 
---
There is a poster at train stations and big Al's tattoo shop 
---
Yeah I made a post about that. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. You die before you even spawn in. Some guy called me a lair and was demanding proof. Glad to see others are giving it exposure.
---
It just started, so the horde wants blood. I imagine it will calm down in a bit.
---
If youre going to ask that, youre basically asking why would you even make a new character period, and the answer is to experience the content again but in a different mode. The question I would be more interested in is Why would anyone bring their level 200+ into a new mode, and the only answer I can come up with is to camp noobs and troll people. Theres literally nothing else for them to do, which is why it should have been locked to new characters. 
---
Good ideas that could help PvP.
---
Remove stacking of primary legendary effects.  No more +15 STR on a set of unyielding or huge sentinel reduction. Encourage gear variety.
---
Remove Adrenal stacking with Bloodied effects
---
Buff Furious to 60 percent from 30.
---
Instigating doesn‚Äôt stack with sneak or nerf to first hit on an enemy in general.
---
Prevent armor penetration from adding, A.A. would go primary, perks would affect the number remaining, then mods last.
---
Buff assassin to 50 percent on players.
---
Make mutants stack up to 5 mutations.
---
All creature specifics go up to 100 percent more damage to that creature.
---
20 point damage buff to ranged weapons across the board.
---
Energy weapons are affected by A.A. perks and attachments.
---
Critical shots don‚Äôt ignore armor.
---
Perks would exist to prevent cap loss or minimize aid reduction, replace serendipity with this perk. (45 percent to take 0 damage is bs, no matter which way you slice it)
---
Well its good that you can't shoot 1 hit kill from Dragon with VATS. That is stupid. I'd understand you get one shot kill with sniper rifle without VATS to head, what is one hell of a shot.
---
Dang,  I figured it was a mutual understanding that it's kill on sight.  That's cool that you actually got to do an event!
---

---
No I don't think so.
---
If you have to quote half of what I said to extrapolate information to fit your narrative, you're the one with the problem.
---
Max 5 random aid items to drop would be okay imo. There was also magazines and stealth boys etc in the bags...
---
Somebody went to test to see if they work. They don't 
---
Back when I used to grow a garden I would spend hours every time I moved camps making sure my crops ether didn‚Äôt float or I put them down in such a way I couldn‚Äôt notice it. I have a problem and i know it. Whenever I go to other peoples camp I want to rearrange their stuff, and I‚Äôll even take over peoples workshops if I don‚Äôt like how they have it set up.  
---
&gt;Most players never saw the promotions or paid particular attention to any masks.  
---
The people complaining on here obviously did see them and were obviously paying attention.  They wouldn't complain about not getting something that they didn't know was in the game. 
---
That pic made the rounds on the internet, and 3/4 of the masks featured were virtually impossible to get.   It think it would have been different if the pic had featured all of the masks, the common ones alongside the rare ones.  Instead, Bethesda promoted the rarest masks as the main ones associated with the quest. 
---
Scully, you're not going to believe this...
---
Does berry mentats show invisible players?
---
Thank you! I have so many questions. First, how was the encounter? Epic battle or a near-one-shot shitshow? Also, how much aid did the opponent drop? I‚Äôm wondering how much I should bother putting away.
---
Your not the only one who thinks it was a bad idea to let people bring their characters in 
---
Yes to teams, yes to fast travel, no to friendly fire.
---
I realize that there will still be a ton of killing, thus the incentive not really being necessary.
---
And I disagree. Without added incentive there will be people who band together and don't just kill everything on sight.
---
I just want to know its lore.
---
Simple, start in Adventure Mode, spawn where ever you want, switch to survival mode...boom problem solved. Or it doesn't work like that?
---
my problem isnt that it "isnt fair" or that i lost items.
---
but when the game literaly says SOME items i dont expect MOST my items on a single death.
---
YES PLEASE! BETHESDA DO THIS AND ILL SUCK UR \*\*\*\*!
---
As a murder hobo myself I can tell you I only do it for the caps and not to listen to your anguish. I am a broke boy after all
---
Sold a bloodied version to WS bot when it was so pathetic and stash limit was only 400 lbs. Luckily found a BE version later and didn‚Äôt sell it this time lol 
---
That's why I made Survivor Sam, has nothing and is intended to only be used in survival mode.
---
For sure.  Incentives to loot and also carry what you need rather than deposit all items
---
I was just like you at first so I refunded the game. Haven‚Äôt rebought it yet, but when it‚Äôs released on steam I‚Äôm definitely going to.
---
Cool, good to know! :)
---
Ahh makes sense. I don't think I'd commit the points just for that, but different strokes.

Dont worry, if I see it, I'll just admire your handiwork, use your benches, sleep in your bed before cleaning off in the rad arch, then play a tune for a buff and I'll be on my way. 
---
Why? Because I enjoy PvP, but I'm not a total dick and destroying your work serves no purpose in the mode. Unless you're my target and for some reason my beef with you goes beyond kill trading and gets vindictive. But hey, if we get to that level of rivalry, maybe you deserved a little tit for tat and a little damage would be a part of the PvP experience.
---
Leveling camps in the past was ideal for cap farming. I think the fact that there WONT be bounties will make it a less common occurence (at least as time goes on and people settle down about their lessened boundaries). 
---
I don‚Äôt think you even understand what ‚Äúcondescending ‚Äú means, here let me help you.

---
I think I do. I'll check as soon as the xbox servers come back on and let me download the update
---
You will find one eventually. If you haven‚Äôt been killed for your crimes yet that is 
---
It‚Äôs no fun at all, losers with that jumping stuff and all that shit, op and all... 
---
Iv lost 2,000 caps because of it 
---
After I get that gun I‚Äôm out 
---
Hmmm.  Maybe.  I killed a random 3* ghoul after the patch and got a 3* weapon.  Small sample size I know but I‚Äôm so used to getting 1* stuff it was nice to see.  I hope you are right.  
---
Because carry weight perks don't apply to stashes? People have had no reason until now to shash their aid items and you were better off just using perks like Traveling Pharmacy and Thru Hiker to hold all their chems and food and saving stash space for more important stuff.
---
I'm personally holding over two hundred pounds of chems and non perishable food WITH both of those perks.
---
If I ever wanted to play survival I would either have to junk thousands of items I could still hold onto no problem in Adventure or lose thousands of items the first time I die in survival.
---
Survival mode is broken. Right now as I speak there are four people with incredible builds fighting around Vault 76. I died there and they all 1-shot me. Each one. And they are fighting each other. Should've been NEW characters for Survival Mode. 
---
Nahh
---
I just wish they'd introduce a game mode with no legendaries, and have everyone start from scratch
---
Sounds like rust all over again.
---
Yea, if you go and loot now every bag you find it is insta overweight...
---
Use a stealthboy and sneak by it,it worked with me
---
yep it's just southeast of the super duper mart which moira brown of megaton sends you to do for part of her questline (writing the wasteland survival guide). he'll usually come running toward you when you get close enough though; it's when you turn the quest in that he's hiding in the shelter.
---
Cool, had a similar scenario
---
they fled when they heard humans coming, remembering that they are not supposed to be seen yet.
---
Wouldn't they be extremely limited now with Slap Damage gone? Basically relegated to destroying one's camp which at worst is what 40 caps to "move" &amp; have everything fixed? 
---
Seems a lot better than some of the greifing we've read about the past months. 
---
That said my camp was nuked once about a month ago &amp; I was kind of like "hey, it finally happened!" Hasn't been as much of an issue for some. 
---
Ok, going back and reading what I posted, I would have to add two words to the start of my post.  'Is it' that is all I would change, but the sentiment is the same. 
---
I'm not using any mods. Plain old vanilla.
---
Just the op crit build
---
Well if someone play like that, then why is he even playing in Survival Mode? Survival mode is all about getting into exciting situations with other player while on the road.
---
Okay, I added you. I'm gonna try to be as long as I can but I might not be here depending when you re gonna be on
---
How much?
---
Because it‚Äôs not their fight. The sub has been divided since the duping ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs just taken multiple forms, but it‚Äôs White Knights VS dupers, again, and again.
---
It would be stupid to have a "longest lived" leaderboard if you could get to the top of it by leaving your character in sneak in an out-of-the-way location.
---
Yeah I was trying to get to whitesprings where there was a nuke zone and a group of asshats were spawn killing everyone like it was cod or some shit. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have ANYTHING but my guns on me when I fast traveled because as soon as the game loaded I was killed instantly. I‚Äôll just stick to adventure because it seems survival has already turned into gta online.
---
Sometimes it will be most of it if it's random (and they said it would be last Thursday.) That's the risk you take in Survival. Leave most of it at home next time. 
---
Im 6 and only 6 because I'm really bad at all other aspects of this game
---
I'm still over here having fun destroying people's camps.
---
Adventure mode forever!
---
Suggestions:
---
_____________________
---
Aid items dropped should have a cap.
---
For example:
---
 ‚Ä¢ No more than 6 types of aid items 
---
 ‚Ä¢ No more than 12 of each
---
 ‚Ä¢ And never more than half of what you are carrying 
---
New crafting items:
---
**EMP mines and grenades**
---
Essentially a method for preventing players from stealthing.
---
**Smoke grenades**
---
For avoiding gunfire and for fleeing.
---
**bear traps**
---
For rooting enemies in place for a brief period 
---
I may be wrong to say this but I feel the most important thing that needs to change first his spawn killing. 
---
Would be nice if they implemented something like a two minute timer that begins once you‚Äôre connected to a server that will prevent any outgoing and incoming player damage until said timer completes. 
---
How can anyone expect a play at all if every time they login another players are able to kill them before they even have control of their character on the server.
---
Would also help handle where people are going abuse combat logging. Nothing stops them from immediately logging out as they know their death is incoming, and  then reconnect a server through a friend to get the jump on people when they think they‚Äôre gone from server for good or just completely undetectable. 
---
I knew something like that could happened on my main character. I had to move a lot of stuff to my secondary characters before I even tried the new mode. After I died, I only lost some unimportant junk and 3 Stimpaks out of 5. Interestingly, I was able to keep my stealboy and all the radaway and rad X I had before I got killed by a purple pussycat. 
---
PS. Careful with snipers. There are already a lot of organized groups that are easily taking over the new mode. Unless you like to play the game of hide and seek, you will die very quickly if you are not very experienced on PVP like me.
---
20% boost to 11 XP would be 13.2 XP. 
---
It‚Äôs a random number of aid items you just got unlucky 
---
i would if my stash wasnt at 798-800.
---
PvP hobo here, and I do it for the thrill and the challenge. Level 180 is pretty mundane without it.
---
Yeah. If their actual intent of the percentage that we are seeing is legit, that‚Äôs fucked.
---
What's your ps4 name I forgot to ask earlier
---
The lowest players should be shown on the map, now THAT would be interesting 
---
yeah i got one shot aswel. in full vanguard + 305 hp.
---
so that really is a one time deal for me.
---
I was thinking around 500 caps. Is that acceptable? I know its limited to get but it isn't really a powerful recipe. 
---
Theoretically, yes. But I'm not one to want to leave the server every time i want to leave an area
---
11exp/100% 0,11 exp
---
0.11exp \*20% = 2.2 exp bonus
---
You should lose everything thing.
---
I actually quite like the shape of this, reminds me of an old domed shaped barracks or something (I can't think of the proper name). 
---
I thought I could make a bunch of Handmade and scrap them to unlock all mods, nope didn‚Äôt work. I could only unlock a certain mod when the unit I scrap had that mod or accessories attached. 
---
Time to clean out if you wanna keep going in Survival without risking losing 3/4 of a stack of aid :) 
---
Or alternatively, and this is up to you of course, stay in Adventure mode. 
---
If you do how much caps would you want for it? I was thinking around 500. 
---
I do not disagree with this type of situation because it is pretty crazy and I high-level players able to transfer into survival mode, especially knowing that they are going to of course bringing in their power armor and everything else. I honestly do agree that survival mode should be a fresh start for everybody which will make things very fun and interesting, but as for legendary weapons and stuff like that I think it should be rewarded and both sides in survival mode and adventure mode so people don't have to complain about why this legendary weapon is on one side and not the other.
---
I did try out my new character in survival mode to give it a try and see how survival mode was and I tried using my level 23 character and basically, a level 8 defeated my character with two shots with a shotgun which was pretty crazy but it's nice to see that players can at least get a fighting chance but up against a 100+ Player is impossible and considering how they ALL have Power armor on ALL the time which makes it an unfair fight. Power armor shouldn't be allowed to be honest in survival mode. It isn't that hard for players to defeat high-level monsters with just normal armor so I do not see the problem at all. 
---
Well when you‚Äôre getting killed before you even spawn in it‚Äôs kind of a problem my dude. I died before my game even loaded after fast travel. I spawned into me dying 10+ times. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt make you good at the game. It makes you someone who abuses a bug. 
---
theres a fix where players have 10 times more of all stats and math except their damage done, one shot game play isnt fun but neither is an infinite stalemate.
---
ive been recommending the 10 times boost for everything but damage the competitiors are dealing for a while to a variety of games trying to make pvp areas or minigames within their MMOs
---
Yes, it would be much better if the way you got to the top of the "longest lived" leaderboard was to park your character somewhere obscure and stay in sneak while you watch Netflix and occasionally jiggle the mouse.
---
Its Blueberry_Blitzz
---
i dont mind the occasional pvp, but when people can still 1 shot you and now also take 3/4th of all my aid, ill forgo the 20% exp bonus and just stick to adventure.
---
its still random, so the more mods you get the lower the % to get a new mod. but thats weird because i did this with western revolvers and it worked perfectly.
---
I'm glad we lose SOMETHING when we die. Junk is both extremely painful to lose, and still not so valuable that it makes you angry enough to rage.
---
If that works best for you, great. That's why there are two modes. :)
---
Hopefully with time they‚Äôll make it so that when you connect a survival it is just automatically disabled.
---
In the meantime people should be sure to disable the pacifist mode when on adventure mode before switching over to survival beta.
---
‚Äú...marzipan didlos‚Äù
---
Found my new character name!
---
The vast majority of people complaining are making extremely valid points. Being killed by invisible enemies that haven't loaded yet was bad enough when it was just ghouls and scorched but now people have to worry about players and losing hundreds of caps and all of their chems and food. 
---
aah ok.  I tend to check every corpse and meat pile I run across, but rarely find any mass and/or HRF on them.  I do sometimes - more often than not it'll be hardened mass (which I already have a lot of...)
---
because it's a beta?
---
Nope 
---
I just discovered that to.
---
I hope someone can see this:
---
The plasma gatling dosnt show the proyectile upon firing it, you can see the the target bein hit but not the proyectil,  its something that happens when the gun has a explosive effect that is now affecting all non explosive plasma gatlings. 
---
Yeah I hope they take out all the legendary shit. Just give us a semi realistic survival mode.
---
The problem was/is BGS really didn‚Äôt see what the community wanted from this new mode.  Other than we needed it. 
---
If you join survival with new character to try it and form an opinion you‚Äôll have a bad one as everyone is going with their Sunday best and whatnot. 
---
If you join with your best character and lose 2k caps. You should have seen what we are dealing with in adventure pre survival and seen what it is like with the rules turned off. 
---
I'm also easily getting caps by selling looted aid items. I'm not carrying any chems with me while I kill others from a safe distance with my lever action rifle.
---
Yeah but what after 3 weeks when some are high level with good gear ? Should everyone restart as new chars again ? 
---
I‚Äôm on board with that. 
---
Same on mine
---
Query: Were you in Survival or Adventure?
---
Makes me wonder if we do need a tamer version of adventure mode...where there is absolutely no likelihood of PVP...survival mode was made for PVP folks (so that subset of folks are having their needs catered to)...adventure mode is in the so called middle and then "peace mode" for those of us that want to focus on everything but any likelihood of PVP...a mode that all the griefers would not even enter as they would be utterly bored.
---
Power armor is garbage in PvP though. 
---
Ok crafting it now just let me know when you will be on next 
---
It was the first thing I looked for when I booted up the game, luckily the map is a different segment altogether but I‚Äôm not a fan of looking at green so much, it‚Äôs not the most appealing or visible colour to have.
---
I‚Äôm 3 secs away from making this a new post and get this idea out there. It‚Äôs too good. 
---
Yes for some weapons I could scrap a bunch of basic units and unlock many mods, such as combat shotgun and double barrels, but some other ones I had to scrap that specific components in order to learn it. It‚Äôs really weird indeed. 
---
Honestly it just soundsike you're bad. 
---
i personally think they should have locked survival mode to new characters. or copies of current ones, your current special setup, no gear (spawn inside the vault, no PVP until you exit) you also can spawn as level 50 and start off from there. you also start off with 0 caps and 0 junk.  
---
I want the camo shotgun, but not the PA paint ;~;
---
Hopefully I can buy separate and not in the bundle
---
yeah, i know that, i was curious, figured, i dont mind the occasional pvp if i just farm some ghouls n stuff for the 20% extra xp, and i wouldnt mind losing some aid, they also said they adressed 1 shotting and stuff.
---
load into world, collect a group of ghouls, guy jumps up behind a wall, instakills me and takes 3/4th of my aid items.
---
they basicly bullshitted with the patchnote update
---
Thanks I‚Äôll hopefully be on within the hour or the next. My update is installing.
---
I think that would help clarify your intentions. :-p
---
You can sudo fly without hacking. Bird bones and stranger in numbers with a full team. Now jump off a high place.
---
They have that, just look at Elder Scrolls Online. Entire nation wide PvP with sieges , large deployments and advanced roles in combat. They just need time to implement it in a way that fits Fallout. What they should not do is this Battle Royale, what would fit the style would be Faction PvP instead.
---
Lol strategy coming about carrying un broken down junk and the looter quickly picking up and encumbered 
---
I may have to start finding higher level players that fit into my schedule.  I‚Äôve been playing since day 1, and leveling up has taken forever.  Thank you for taking the time to respond and giving advice.
---
Hells yeah. I was afraid survival wasnt going to be extreme enough.
---
yup same here, i didnt lose ALL items (like, 39 radaway went to 9) but its still BS that you lose over 3/4th of your aid.
---
For the 20% xp boost, legendary boost.
---
Sleep, eat cranberry relish, join a group, use perk card. Go farm with 50% xp boost.
---
Go to adventure, find group set up camp near where you want to farm, switch to survival and get a xp and legendary boost. Got it? Avoid whitesprings because of PKers. Enjoy.
---
I would love to go but it's 18hrs away and I hate driving so probably not unless I know someone who is going and ride with them lol
---
It would take way longer than 3 weeks to get there, without the duped weapons in, and hardly any fast travel. Have you tried the PVP in Survival?
---
How about no map? That would really be intense.
---
You kill them by getting them to stagger.  That drops the sentinel effect and they die.  There are a variety of ways to trigger a stagger, depending on your build and/or equipment.
---
Or if you're a sniper build, headshot crit used to work.  Haven't tried in the latest version with the PVP damage nerf.
---
Fresh start ? And then after a few weeks ? When some are high level and with good gear ? Should everyone restart again then when new players are coming ? It‚Äôs an endless lope 
---
Then you need a friend like me that will stand idly by while a deathclaw has its way with you til you beg for mercy while i loot fans and tell you that they're a great source of metal and screws. I don't believe in carrying, just education. I dont have issues dropping the stupid hard stuff for someone, but they best be putting in the work too.
---
That sounds good to me, I was able to sign in so my game is updating now. I'll let you know once I get on.
---
That is true, there are some weird situations where if you do log in you apparently respond into a different location and survival mode I think because I spawned in a different location and I didn't know why so I assume that's happening with everybody. But I think it would make the experience more fair for everybody if experience XP was boosted up a little bit more as well as no power armor and it would require people to make a new character for a fresh start. But I think train stations should be a safe Zone area so it would make things Fair.  
---
They do, but that's another studio inside Bethesda.
---
The guys on this one clearly don't know much about Player vs. Player balance.
---
Evil :D it is also weard that it shows in the map every players paper bags
---
I feel the community can be a little too forgiving sometimes but they make up for it by being merciless when something is wrong. I gotta respect them for that, I love you guys! 
---
How can you move stuff to other characters? With a friend's help? Yeah, I'm not experienced with PvP at all and not like that hide and seek stuff, just wanted to try it... Just realized lost all nuka cola quantum I had found since game release :(. But thanks for the advice
---
This sub is dedicated to the game. What do you think? Oh wait... you're just trying to be edgy on the internet.
---
Yeah but then a couple weeks later, there's gonna be a bunch of level 30s camping at Vault 76 for any of the new characters. Starting new again won't solve shit.
---
Did you think it wasn't going to be exactly like that? 
---
OMG, it‚Äôs amazing
---
You might be thinking of Fallout NV with the Wacky Wasteland trait. There's an easter egg of a fridge with a whip and a fedora. A reference to Indiana Jones.
---
Or more likely, we don't have level 57 twinks losing battles but winning wars by only losing 114 caps per death. I think your solution is actually *THE* best one I've seen for the leveling power/caps disparity issue.
---
Seems like it prioritizes stims.  Started with 40, got 100ish after one kill, 140 after a second and dropped to 8 after dying.  I lost other things too, mainly food and water in large stacks.  Not hard to get back, just annoying to lose caps, especially when the survival challenge isn't counting legendary kills. 
---
You got to be in survival mode  
---
Yeah, I would think it should be free to move but in addition to possibly costing hunger/thirst (all that effort setting up the tent!) should only last for 60 minutes or something.
---
Designed as a quick and easy free way to refresh. A permanent fast travel point would be loved, but I don't think beth wants use to fast travel free all the time.
---
That would be plain ridiculous since my idea of making the experience XP boost would be fairer.
---
Hey yo Dave what‚Äôs that loud ass sound....oh shit!
---
I want this so bad ...just think of the panic that would ensue when you hear all the noises of a nuke but had no indication where it was headed.
---
Thanks so much.
---
What build have you got?
---
I don't do PvP but it makes sense the longest living people are highlighted- Bethesda has made a king of the hill scenario that forces PvP in survival mode.
---
You cannot run around in there doing what you want indefinitely for extra xp &amp; rewards, Bethesda wants conflict &amp; PvP.
---
I'm not really quite sure how the calculations and percentage works in Fallout 76 but I do know for a fact that making it times together would make it more fair.
---
This is true, but at the same time it's so easy to make your character a Nuka-Cola fan given that they almost held a monopoly in the universe.
---
Seriously tho just encountered a team of 3, I killed them 4 times each but they all had no caps. They still had full ass/cav gear so it was easy for them to close the gap and eventually one was able to take me out. Please explain to me how this isn‚Äôt an exploit when I lose 400 caps for gettin killed once and they lose nothing for being killed repeatedly. A downvote proves nothing except a love for exploiting the system. I‚Äôm happy to engage in a discussion if you want, I mean why make the post if you won‚Äôt respond?
---
How about no game?
---
I saw this as a horde event. I had to do a double take. Got excited, joined, then it turned out to be a scorched one heh. 
---
Bulked on a retired character lol. 
---
Yeah I thought that,  not like I have time to search for bags in high traffic area.  Hard enough finding my own sometimes
---
If you don't put them on the map, the way to get things like "longest lived" is to park yourself in an obscure location and wait.  You'd be on top of the longest lived forever.
---
He said he was in survival. I think it resets on death. I'm at 0 after killing 2 legendaries and I died before I checked the challenge.
---
I started survival with 1.5 caps. In 3 hours I got to 5.5k caps. Never used a stealth boy. Just walking around with a bloodied non-explosive handmade and a tesla rifle. The game's PvP mechanics are pretty involved and I feel like not understanding them puts you at more of a disadvantage than not being correctly geared out. If the fan base put as much time into figuring out PvP as they did SBQ landing mechanics, then this would probably be muce more enjoyable for them. It's certainly not for everybody, and I'm not asking others to like what I like.
---
That said, the brief invulnerability period just doesn't work. If two people travel to a train station, someone's going to get stuck in a spawn kill cycle and someone's going to get stuck killing spawns in an endless loop. You might think someone's camping it, but in reality whoever's pulling the trigger can't take their eyes off the spawn point without risking getting killed and stuck in the same position. 
---
Actually, no. It was a legitimate question, Mr. EdgeLord. Everybody I've seen that has played the game hasn't touched it in ages. Haven't seen many videos on it either. 
---
I would rather the survival track most kills in the top three rather than longest life so I can root-toot around in my hardcore game mode without becoming a target every 30 minutes. If I want the rewards for killing the most players, I can choose to do that, but if I just want to game I can do that as well with the added difficulty of pvp and limited fast travel.
---
Same here with me on xbox. I literally have to rely on the spinning animation and hit markers to see if im on target. My tse minigun is like tracer fire. Drives me nuts.
---
I would really like a cap loss limit. After level 50, well more like 65 or so. Since you still need a few levels to round out most builds, anyways after around that level, there isn't really a gameplay advantage, its mostly about gear. I'm only 83 right now, but as I climb and get higher and higher it'll just get more painful. 
---
Like at level 200 you drop what 400 caps? Thats two whole daily vendors. The aid items and junk are easy to lower, just bring less. 
---
I don't have a ton of use for caps right now just buying expensive recipes for powerarmor and the like, but I would want to pvp for fun and I'm willing to lose aid and junk but beforehand I'm pretty much forced to clear out my cap stash if I don't want to lose tons of caps overtime. (As many have pointed out, there are plenty of strong builds) 
---
I don't have a pvp focused build and the adjust system of moving one point at a time is just painfully slow to adjust that. I'm very competent in pvp, but I would like a form of limited liability. Even if the cap is relatively high like 150-200caps per death.
---
You‚Äôre giving them a bad rep for trying to fix their mistakes? I hate seeing this as it seems to be commonplace now but come on dude, at least they are trying right? I mean Pete Hines took a nose dive off of existing and they still have a lot to make up for but better late than never. 
---
They cost a lot to move frequently, and it's hard even with blueprints to "copy paste" your previous layout.
---
A tent with a sleeping bag, a stash box and one other item of the player‚Äôs choosing. It could be a crafting bench, for example, or a musical instrument.
---
Let's say you didn't show up on the map if you're sneaking.
---
How does anyone knock you off the longest lived?
---
Go find somewhere obscure, go into sneak, watch Netflix and jiggle the mouse occasionally.  Permanent #1 on longest lived.
---
I know it seems crazy, but this is exactly the "season" model many games use. It doesn't have to be this frequent, and it doesn't have to negatively impact players who aren't interested in it at all. 
---
I tried to explain it in another thread, if you're interested:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/ej2w10y/
---
TL;DR:  Totally optional, migrate old characters into the existing pool over time, good way to replay the game with culmination for changes made over time, and good way to introduce new players. 
---
Agreed. I sat at Watoga and killed a dozen half loaded characters. Temporary invulnerability on fast travel doesn't seem to be working right.
---
Yup. Killed literally before my screen loaded. 
---
Never played it. Wasnt spawn ranfom in rust?
---
i did. 
---
got one shot as usual and lost 3/4th of all my aid items (dropped from 215 to 164 weight) so i really dont care what happends to that shit show anymore as i dont care about it.
---
Thanks this is exactly what I was looking for. This is my 3rd character and will be the first to get to 50 so I have 3 characters worth of junk I‚Äôm trying to organize haha. 
---
Thank you,
---
 but ‚Äòtis already known
---
I'm still waiting for an apology.
---
 Come on Bethseda - we're here for you.
---
Why have levels at all? :) think about it..
---
I read this in Mathew McConaughey‚Äôs voice from Dazed and Confused.
---
Interesting, using the extractor as a basepoint. I may just have to try this.
---
Although you have to pay to claim every time AND spend all the building materials every time you log in/switch server.
---
It's playing up today. Try again later on. Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Considering people place them next to spawns and you nearly die just spawning in I think turrets should be switched off in survival mode
---
How is it ridiculous? 
---
It's math. 11 + 20% = 13.2 
---
I'm not really quite sure what do you mean by that quote, but I do know for sure that it gives extra resistance that makes it a bit harder to take down a player that has power armor considering what type of power armor it is. I remember I was I took over to factories while walking on foot throughout the forest area and a level 100 guy with a xo1 power armor comes out of nowhere it starts taking my two factories and other extra Factory and also happen to find out that his house was nearby the second factory that I took over. I tried going against them since I was around level 20 but sadly I couldn't do a lot of damage to him since he had power armor on but if he didn't then I'm sure I could have defeated him. Power armor shouldn't be common to find, to be honest.
---
Glad to see your eyes work, mr. Holmes
---
I won‚Äôt do a nuke run anymore unless I‚Äôm teamed up with someone. 
---
I'm going to pull my walls down to the foundation. My house was a pain in the ass to get right, and had been rebuilt multiple times. It's just going to be a foundation and a stash box
---
Only Bethesda calls it a beta when your existing character can freely transition to and from the "test" environment, permanently suffering all the consequences therein.
---
Oh well that's the full crafting list so all the repair items should be in there
---
Beautiful. I wish more players enjoyed the CAMP system enough to make things like this. I'm slowly working my way there!
---
Seriously?  That sucks.  You should not be allowed to die instantly upon spawning in.  Perhaps build in a safe spawn zone or allow a 5-10 second buffer.  Until that‚Äôs fixed I‚Äôll never set foot in survival mode.  Why bother if you get killed instantly? 
---
Maybe the real phat lewtz were the friends we made along the way...
---
Makes sense to me. Highlighting the three players with the most player kills gives anyone who doesnt wanna get killed a chance to avoid these players, while allowing those who are playing survival to hunt other players a target to go for. Plus IRC the more players you kill the more rewards you get so this is a way to make it more and more challenging for players that have been racking up the kills. If you dont want to get hunted down once you are at the top of the leaderboard then you should just switch to survival. No one is going to unintentionally get to the top of the leaderboard. Anyone up there will be wanting the PVP combat.
---
It took me a while to get over my expectations of a FO4 style experience. I only blame myself for that, because they did say at the outset it would be different. But I put on the vault suit and suddenly forgot all that and was bewildered why everything was not Diamond City and Goodneighbor all over again. I think the similarities in some of the atmosphere made it more jarring when you encounter something like VATS or bobbleheads of whatever that was completely reworked for 76.
---
I have several. Won't be on until later.
---
Gt same as ID
---
Very nice! My CAMP has been in this spot forever, I‚Äôm sure it will be ok there :) 
---
Never heard of him.
---
Everything you are talking about was bound to happen sooner or later. If everyone had began with new characters, it would have happened later. 
---
I might need to do that at some point, but honestly I like the idea of limiting myself to only one characters worth of storage. I've been storaging a ton of legendaries for when the vendor drops. I've been forced to sell/drop many of them that arent 3pounds per star. I think I have roughly 450 pounds so far.
---
here is a mechanic it could be replaced with - make rare equipment spawn at specific locations, an example would be the whitespring golf clubhouse, as people already have the trend of going there to spawn rare finds.
---
isntead of placing PLAYERS on the map you now have repeatable player path crossing for a purpose, rare material needed to maintain and hold the powerful weapons, where this a slight chance a  weapon spawns if no one is wielding it already on the server.
---
they want a king of the hill aesthetic but a leaderboard and map braodcast cant accomplish that, the way to accomplish that is to have worthwhile areas that players reliably cross paths with higher drama and incentive to organize, compete, or cooperate (karma system deepens the drama yes or yes?)
---
True that. Anyhow, It was fun to play same game but with different mechanics. I was seriously afraid when people had put 600c bounty on me and I was waiting for them in one spot. The thing that they know where you are but not the other way around is spooky
---
This map is awesome. Great work. There is one I've found, near Robco, west of that circular raider camp. Half way between the rail line and the road to watoga. 
---
I remember finding a grave site there.
---
&gt;So if you made people roll a new character, what will you do in 4 weeks when everyone has all that gear from farming?
---
Well, to start, I wouldnt get camped coming straight out of the vault on every server I joined. Then, after dispersing into the map away from the vault, the 4 weeks would be alot of fun having fairly balanced pvp fights with the people I happen to come across while questing. After that, assuming you are correct and people would be exactly as OP as they are now after a mere 4 weeks of grinding (which i REALLY dont think you are), I would be better able to avoid griefers having established my camp and discovered other spawn point options. 
---
Just switch to adventure*
---
On the main menu, it‚Äôll be one of the options. 
---
Start menu. Not sure what platform you‚Äôre on but on Xbox it‚Äôs map key then LB, scroll down to atom store :)
---
It's more likely, but if there is no power armor in Survival Mode then there is a chance for a little of a player to have a Fighting Chance since Bethesda did say they have adjusted and balance out the damage between players so I do not think level really matters.
---
Could you please give achievements some love and attention next update ?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5alyl/can_we_talk_about_broken_achievements_in_76/
---
Done
---
so far everything with a limited availability timer has been gone-gone as soon as the timer runs out.  Haven't seen any item reappear in the shop later on, and I'm really hoping that some do
---
Ok. I won't be on until 11pm MT
---
a little off topic but how did you get so many stimpacks ? is it easier to get them in survival ? 
---
Seriously. I'm so happy they have a place to go and that the incentive is higher for them to kill other people who enjoy pvp. Now the rest of us can rebuild the wasteland in peace.
---
The funny thing is I‚Äôm almost level 200 and I have yet to see the Flatwoods Monster.
---
I understand, but the real issue is the people spawn killing at train stations
---
On PS4 Load up the map then press L1
---
Ill make sausages and donuts for everyone 
---
This is great! I really love it when people share their camps
---
Democracy is non-negotiable 
---
That's my second largest gripe, I'm a huge PvPer but game sanctioned Aimbot is a no go.
---
we are going to have a hard time trying to not to slip with the tears of all everyone that gets killed in survival and comes to cry at the subreddit.
---
That would be quite a stretch, and removes a huge factor from he game. Trading is a must
---
Brings excitement for sure.  Good talking bro. Too bad your on PC, I'd def add you otherwise.  
---
Happy hunting!
---
11 + 20% = 31. That's the type of math that should be used in Video Games but as for stats and weapons that's a different story.
---
What do YOU mean, you people??
---
Plasma mine, stealth boy, cavalier kamikaze
---
Leveled worlds would be helpful but it won‚Äôt fix the bigger problems. 
---
Level 1-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60
---
At level 60 you should have all special points allocated and have most of your build completed. 
---
Are drop rates higher in survival?
---
Not after the recent balance change. I saw a stealth sniper complaining that he shot a guy in power armor and it took a smaller amount of his health than it did in PVP mode previously.
---
You too! :)
---
Mothmen represent!
---
Oh, wow. I'm on EST, I'll prob be out by then.
---
Yeah i dont know what the guy's build is but mine wasn't really specced for what i was doing either ( i run bloodied/stealth build, effective at a distance but a paper bag that dies often) , i wanted to see how viable assassins/sentinels build would be in an open pvp mode. So i stand there and spam fire the dude with a tse handmade while not moving? Well the guy ran around me in circles shooting me with a lever action, just me trying to see where he went i had to break the sentinels effects to find him and bam. This is me trying to see what a noob with moms credit card and bought duped gear would be doing against any other. Seeing how everyone is raving about it being unbalanced,  i wanted to see if they are actually that OP. Based on my very limited experiment, they can be disposed off quite easily. Or maybe i just didnt really try, i don't know. 
---
I see a lot of people posting similar things so I will stick with what I've said before.  This quoted from Bethesda's patch notes today.
---
" 
---
##### HIGH-STAKES DEATH MECHANICS
---
* On death, players will drop a random amount of the Aid items that were in their inventory in addition to all their Junk.
---
* Cap rewards for player kills, and Cap deductions on death, have been doubled in Survival Mode.
---
* The Seek Revenge respawn option has been disabled and will not appear when attempting to respawn.
---
* When killed during PVP combat, players can choose to spend a portion of their Caps to place a Bounty on their killer.
---
   * This will mark that player as Wanted and display the Bounty amount on all other players‚Äô Maps.
---
   * Half of the Caps spent by the slain player will appear as the Bounty reward, and the minimum cost to place a Bounty is 200 Caps.
---
First bullet point states that the aid items dropped will be a "random" amount.  So if you have 300 stimpaks or radaway, a random amount can be 1-300.  Everyone has access to these patch notes.  Everyone was made aware of this from the start.  And everyone (maybe not everyone) seems to have problems with this.  Doesn't make sense to me.  You can have your version of "some" and compare it to "most" but Bethesda clearly said it's a "random" amount.  
---
The reason PA isn't that great is because when you get higher level you can get gear with modifiers (i.e. -8% Dmg taken from players), on all of you gear. On PA you can't get legendary affixes and can only mod some slots. So later on you can become more powerful by having a non PA gear set. 
---
But as a level 20 it seems strong because it does reduce damage taken, just relative to other gear it's only meh. At level 25 I believe you can get a whole set of Raider Power Armor. I'm sure if you search the sub you can find the spawn locations.
---
HELL√ñ BR√ñTHER, HAVE S√ñME FREE KARMA
---
I have an odd schedule with work and school. Weekends are best for me.
---
I'm at work right now. My Gamertag is the same as my name here. I should be on tonight in about 4ish hours, if not I'm on almost every Wednesday night.
---
It's called game balanced, you do realize some complaints are valid don't you? People bitching about being ganked by level 100s whilst they are level fives aren't valid. Spawn Camping and VATs are big issues.
---
So once it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs never coming back?
---
Wow lol Nice job senior dictionary.
---
I said condescending because you state you wanted a discussion. Yet start off speaking negative and bitching on something, at the time, just came out and you hadnt played.
---
Now that youve had some time in it do you feel its still poorly thought out?
---
Apparently it‚Äôs also people camping out at the train stations to gank people and one shot them when they spawn in.  If true, that‚Äôs fucking weak.  
---
If it's caps you want there are far easier, and less morally questionable ways
---
Okay.  I‚Äôm sorry, I think I misunderstood a bit.  I‚Äôm here because I am in need of a lot of help from people who understand the game better.  (I‚Äôm also in need of screws, thanks for that information).  I just didn‚Äôt want to give the impression that I wanted people to just tell me what to do or just watch them kill big things and I take the credit for it.  That would be fair or much fun...
---
Momma didn‚Äôt raise no fool. 
---
This is nothing more that a peepee measuring contest. 
---
if VATS is so broken why don't you use it then
---
Could it be, the suspected vault dungeon as seen in the wild Appalachia trailer? Intriguing, can‚Äôt wait to see where this goes 
---
Didn't work for him either according to New Vegas 
---
That doesn't change my point though. The reason PA is bad in PvP is because there are better alternatives. The fact they nerfed the equivalent of bolt-action rifles has nothing to do with how good it is in PvP. I guess it's slightly better now, but a PA wearer will always lose to a non PA wearer if he has the right equipment.
---
So not from in game at all?
---
Exactly. Anyone going into PVP before clearing their aid and caps is a fat goose wanting to be cooked. 
---
Perfect, I'll def be on
---
Because I'm a melee build and AP is required for literally living and wasting it on fucking VATs is literally the worst thing someone could do.
---
Same for me. Two disconnects and two infinite load screens in about in hour and a half.
---
Stealth boys and Chameleon armor should help with the VATS issue.
---
Not much can be done about spawn campers, unless you start hunting them, since you know where they will camp.
---
What other problems are there?
---
Np, I have a lot. If you don't get one somewhere else, you can hit me up if I'm on. I might be on late later in the week, and on the weekend.
---
Lol good thing I don't pvp in this game u use the chem weight reduction perk have about 600 regular stims and about 250 supers on me at all times
---
This is a Beta, this is the feedback they  need. My suggestion is 5 level + or - match making on survival servers.
---
Armor piercing explosive double barrel shotgun with max shotgun SPECIAL perks and a perk that cripples
---
Except you DO show up on the map if you are one of the longest surviving people on the server. And it doesn't take long. Within 15 MI utes of joining a server, I was the longest surviving person, and then I was chased down by a level 268 with a knife that I couldn't outrun. 
---
I‚Äôm on pc, so you can‚Äôt do it in game? Have to log out?
---
I sort of know what you mean but I do not care about power armor whatsoever because of the fact I like to go in raw into the battle and face a real challenge using tactic and maneuver! But using a Power Armor against a low level is cowardly. Fight fair and square or pick a fight with somebody else that's the same level as you!
---
The extractor was somewhere else in reddit. I can't take full credit. The idea is since the resources are tied t the world and extractors always appear in the same spot, everything else will.
---
As for cost, ususally there is a quest to clear the workshop which could cover the cost to take and then I believe each shop has resources upon capture. I would also recommend the Contractor perk. Makes everything dirt cheap.
---
It cant be helped i suppose. Hopefully adventure will be more friendly now lol
---
Weapon, armour, perk, and mechanical balances. 
---
I would straight up buy the blackbird skin if it came out lol
---
I was thinking just make the train stations safe areas. But only the train station building itself. You spawn into the building. If you step out of the building you‚Äôre able to die. That would make it so you can‚Äôt be shot yo while trading (unless that‚Äôs already impossible. I wasn‚Äôt able to even try and trade anything. It just blows my mind how fast this beta turned into gta online
---
Power armor sucks for pvp 
---
Ok, I'm on right now, I'll add you, then whenever we're both online we could figure something out
---
agree - or just hide all the keys altogether... hahah can't think of a good reason to ever look at them - either you have the one you need when you try and open something or you don't 
---
I am still waiting on the four horsemen armor skins so I can get the pestilence skin so I can get my plague marine role play on. 
---
The same except the 51 was a purple bar instead.
---
Ok, I'll add you right now, then whenever we are both on, we can figure something out
---
I do not disagree with that.
---
I don't want to be rude but with your build you should be the last one complaining about other builds being broken. You choose higher damage and no ammo cost instead of range and accuracy, that's what you got
---
Guess nobody needed it! Hope someone shows up and gets some use out of it. 
---
Yep that's where I die lol
---
That is why you go and play first 50 levels in Adventure Mode. If you decide you want to do boxing, you don't go and fight right away with Tyson.
---
I'm rocking a single piece of Chameleon but since I'm melee build and actually have to move, it appears the only viable build is guns unless you start breathing heavily and sit in corners hoping someone walks by.
---
Yeah, that was essentially the final straw that made me quit. Spent 100 hours and 113 levels getting my rifle build right, and they nerfed it to shit in the wake of the TSE nerf.
---
Bethesda didn't respect my time as a player, so I stopped giving them my time. I wasnt going to grind out another 35-40 levels to fix what they fucking broke.
---
Is that all jean outfit in game or not cause....I kinda need it.
---
So the paints will disappear and not become a individual item?
---
That game was such a success for them, for real.
---
Yup, so all they need it some internal help from within the company. Should be easy.
---
omg... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
8k this morning spawn farming watoga station fast travel spot. There really isn't unless you're ridiculously lucky farming legendaries.
---
My mom didnt love me either. 
---
How come?
---
wish i could meet some people like that in game
---
Thankfully we got it, but that was a good idea
---
The guys who killed you have all your stuff :|
---
Bethesda fucked up, well done, you didn't take any items from the dupers and now they rule survival mode 1 hitting anyone and having 1000+ armour 
---
Sad mortem inimicus :(
---
Yes ,I think if they would have done the leveling system better in the first place I.e a real exp curve and made levels matter,this would be a much better system.
---
As it stands now,being higher level just means you drop more loot.
---
We now Nukashine for those toasts.
---
Nope, exactly what I expected and I plan on staying well clear, except for earlier today when I joined a friend I wanted to trade with and found myself in a Survival server without warning. Anyway, turns out he was there alone so for about 10 minutes I was the 2nd longest surviving player. Felt good.
---
To be fair yes generally bloodied builds are low HP, but still got one shotted at full HP by a single shot because someone VATs
---
Honestly I can't imagine the amount willpower someone has to do to convince themselves that aimbot is somehow okay in competitive play.
---
Go play the lottery you have the same exact odds but you could actually win money with the lottery.
---
Yeah... we can only hope.
---
They better not be.
---
Dupers cheated the game to get the gear they have and Bethesda rewards them by making a game mode for them to dominate with their duped gear.......and get better drops?
---
Its pretty easy to get 50+ stimpaks from farming the 3(?) Medical places along with tick blood and the chemist perk.
---
I honestly find it ridiculous that they would allow players to transfer their characters into so Viva mode and I am pretty sure the majority of the community knew exactly the high-level players will take advantage of other players, especially with their power armor they use mostly as well as legendary weapons that could just one shot you.
---
¬Ø\ \_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
That's why I asked
---
Legendary aint boosted, only exp is boosted and that boost aint worth it. I mean, do you go and do "feed the people" everytime it is up, always be in group and always have well rested up. If you don't, this 20% boost aint worth it.
---
I expected it to be a bloodbath.  Skulls for the skull throne.
---
To be fair, this is survival mode BETA. If they take the communities suggestions to heart, they can improve it.
---
Too much of a pansy to take on someone who can retaliate?
---
Maybe it doesn‚Äôt count the starless legendaries? I haven‚Äôt been able to test it definitively yet, but I‚Äôve definitely gotten credit for 1 star and a 2 Star I killed.
---
Lol...Power Armor...
---
How come what?
---
&gt; The reason PA is bad in PvP is because there are better alternatives
---
Maybe. But based on the posts I'm reading, the alternatives are not longer better. They are close to being about the same. Some guy was complaining about getting killed in his assassin/ cavalier armor (or something like that) equipped with serendipity perks, etc.   I could tell he'd gotten used to being indestructible and one-shot killing everyone in PVP but today he was getting killed. 
---
what planet are you from where 11 + 20% = 31? 
---
Agreed, survival shouldn't be holding hands for warnings on other players actions.
---
This right here! Just make a large "search" circle near the players location. One gold circle, a silver , and a bronze. This would actually give these players a chance to set up ambushes and such on people actively looking for them.
---
I just bought this game a little under a month ago and have been playing it since
---
There's an auto doc in a basement of Harper's Ferry just begging for this...
---
GOLD THIS MAN
---
No superstes!
---
It makes a sound as it falls currently
---
That would be pretty cool if you could do that and get a throne made of skulls! Maybe Bethesda will do it! lol
---
I saw someone with a sun mask. it's just a dice roll.
---
Pacifist mode! I just got the jump on 3 guys, 2 were incredibly low health and I did nothing to them. One guy was charging me while I was lighting him up and nothing! Then they just rinsed me! I was wondering wtf but now it makes sense, I still had pacifist on!
---
Its ok, i enjoy watching big things try and kill you! But i also like showing people how to craft things or improve their camps, things to watch out for, cool locations to visit and so on. You dont need a carry,  you need a spirit guide lol
---
Perception should help detect sneaking players.
---
Agility should help stay sneaking.
---
Standing players should be visible on map and screen.
---
These are mechanics built into the core of the game, I don't know why they decided to abandon them. 
---
they sure can and with the right weapons it only takes a brief moment.
---
store your valuable shit and only bring it out when u need it
---
Bethesda has already proven they don't understand how coding percentages works.
---
People will keep playing so they can get a 3* legendary...like rats in a skinner box 
---
somehow the one for indy did.
---
No, you can still do it in game, go to the map and hit Z, the menu will come up with Atom store
---
They actually will save you from the blast just not the radiation
---
So you want to punish people who team up?
---
There is nothing stopping you from doing the same.
---
Though I believe you can see a yellow or red arrow in-game that indicates a player location, the majority of the time I have been killed either by someone using chameleon or by some disconcertingly high level player. It's definitely still a tactic, but not full-proof.
---
It's been great fun, to be honest. I'm pleased, however, that adventure and survival are two separate entities.
---
Did you hit play? Patch doesn't start until then.
---
I see you are a man of culture.
---
That is why there is Adventure Mode. Play adventure mode till you are stronger. This mode is like WRC of Rally, you don't just come into WRC because you want to be in WRC. You start from lower league and work yourself up.
---
And in a few weeks you won‚Äôt be able to do that anymore. 
---
Hopefully that will be enough to make you go away. 
---
Yeah. We know. Even then, your not indestructible. Max armor penetration does a good job of negating enough of a sent/cav assassin set to make a dent in health and make crits Painful / deadly.
---
I started a new char and I'm having a blast. I got lucky and looted a invisble when crouching which has been a life saver. 
---
I recon chem loss on death needs to be toned down but if you play steAlthy its not a problem. 
---
I thought by creating a new character that has to start from scratch it would literally even the field out and also prevent any duped items from making it onto the servers... guess that was wishful thinking...
---
I forgot how exhilarating it was being spawn camped by people with one hit guns, pure excitement 
---
Then spawn elsewhere? If you know they are spawn camping, and you keep spawning there knowing they will kill you, it's just retarded isn't it?
---
Seriously? How old are you?
---
I suspect it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll do a bit in a game week but it‚Äôs too much of a resource sink to be my main place.  Plus I do things like pacify animals Im not very meta. My build is ‚Äúoh I got a new special weapon now I‚Äôm gonna get perks for that!‚Äù  Not very strategic for pvp.  
---
I think eventually I‚Äôll just make a pvp alt,  and be careful about stuff, and play survival couple hours a week. Adventure still my jam.
---
This. Only legendaries with stars.
---
So many camp spots will be taken. You would have to place one in a obscure area to not have to server hop until you find a server with both your camp spots not being taken. 
---
Would be a cool idea, or maybe just a portable scrapping table. That‚Äôs all we really need. 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to PvP in survival mode if you don‚Äôt have any caps. Or if you get killed by someone with no caps you should also lose no caps. 
---
It‚Äôs a tricky thing with VATS because it‚Äôs an integral part of the fallout series, I don‚Äôt think it would be the same with out it and I doubt they change it tbh. I understand your complaint tho with auto aim, but survival mode seems less geared around PvP in the traditional sense like COD but more about heightened sense of danger while playing. It definitely could use some tweaks in certain areas tho I‚Äôll give you that, but it‚Äôs a beta ig.
---
This was a very sad attempt at a battle royale.
---
Bgs saw other games make billions so this is what they gave us.
---
Don't worry, I have plan B already set up for that!
---
Ever had a player train a group of Super Mutants directly to your base? I do it some times, and boy, is it fun!
---
I am not quite sure why everyone is complaining about V.A.T.S in survival mode when everybody mostly uses melee builds or they use explosive weapons and not everybody is it going to get a 100% hitmarker with V.A.T.S.
---
Lol why have you not talked about the aid. I heard that shit is messed the fuck up.
---
With the lack of fast travel, I'd agree.
---
Have to head over and "stalk" the enemy, listen for firefights, footsteps, etc.
---
You have to go into the emote section of the Atom Shop and select them all again (they'll have a small checkmark when equipped). 
---
I have to do it constantly, don't know if it's Xbox doing it, or if they'r screwing with the Atom shop.
---
Serious question: What is Bethesda's motivation for rolling out this Survival Mode the way it is now? Is it a concern daily players heavily invested in current characters would not stick around to build new characters? And there aren't enough players who are vocal about starting new characters to make it worthwhile for Bethesda in terms of a business decision? I'm trying to think about the company and what motivates them to continue investing resources into this game to get some kind of pay off for them.
---
Luck of a saint üôè
---
Standing players should never be on the map if Bethesda wants this to be a true survival game. That isn't even fun being able to see everyone if there's PvP enabled. Other survival games wouldn't work with that mindset. 
---
After playing a bit today, I'd say everything you said plus removing everyone but people with a bounty from the map makes sense. And people with a bounty should just be a large area where they could be in, not a pinpoint location.
---
&gt; Standing players should be visible on map 
---
Hell no. All players should be invisible on the map in survival unless someone puts a large bounty on your head. 
---
No.  The game will let you know if your camp is being attacked but it's not very in your face about it.  You have to pay attention to the messages that appear.
---
Because VATs turns competitive play from skill to 95% chance to hit.
---
I can jump around all I want and dodge but it won't matter if that person hits Q and hits me.
---
Idk if this is a bug or not, so I'm not sure if it goes under bugs or QoL, but here goes:
---
The Ballistic Bock beer, that gives you +15% extra damage ballistic weapons, does not work with heavy guns. In my example, it gave extra damage to my 10mm SMG but not the minigun, MG42, and 50.cal machine gun. 
---
I just thought if you were making a list, that I might be able to add something. 
---
Legendaries with no stars don't count
---
please, *please* make a twitter bot
---
Wow!  I love the analogy. Take an upvote.  
---
I shot at him once and saw hit markers but no corpse
---
ohh, no I didn't I was expecting the launcher to update the game like it usually does. weird? I'm reinstalling the game now and then I'll try hitting play.
---
Nm, sorry was skimming
---
 *the high-level players will take advantage of other players, especially with their power armor they use mostly*  
---
Almost no one uses PA in PVP. It's basically useless compared to decently rolled legendary armor pieces.
---
Same.
---
I worked in a munitions factory. One of our machines made a component of the 30 mm. 4800 pcs in 8 hours. Or almost enough ammo for two and a half minutes of firing the chain gun.
---
I got like 6 of them. I can give one to you
---
Did you forget about Stealth boys or what?
---
It's called Normal Math.
---
11 + 21 = 32.
---
50 + 21 = 71.
---
450 - 350 = 100!?!?!
---
Is that how you change which emotes appear in your wheel as well? Been wondering..
---
I run Watoga, whitesprings (not just the golf club, but also the houses to the left), harpers ferry, and generals steakhouse.  I also do awol armaments, hode missions, and uranium fever. I know utanium fever only drops gear up to level 40, but if a piece has the right perks it could be better than what you already have.
---
Problem is that in the moment where you are invincible you are also stuck for the map loading. Ahahah pretty funny
---
Should I call the FBI?
---
If someone with zero caps kills you then you should also drop zero caps. I know there‚Äôs a debuff when you die with zero caps but when it comes to teams of players they can still manage to kill you and take 400+ caps (I‚Äôm lvl 207) and they lose nothing even after being killed 4+ times. 
---
not as much as someone who things that its build has to be the best in every field and gamemode
---
Yeah I just did a Protecteron Horde event and it told me to find the Sheepsquatches. I was amused. 
---
This one does not spark joy 
---
Yall threw a fit and demanded pvp on a fallout game, welcome to reality
---
I won't even be trying it out because of the non locked characters
---
Well expect Wes Tek to be a gathering spot now for a few days, since it‚Äôs posted on reddit.
---
It's a you've been playing on this server too long mechanics lol
---
Free to "speech" whatever you want, just in the sticked thread.
---
Don't need 50 "omg this r bad" titles when scrolling the front page. Slap them into a megathread.
---
&gt;My opinion is one that was 100% formed by my roughly 100 hours of play time.
---
&gt;Any defense of this game and future content is pure shilling at this point.
---
So YOU get to decide what's a valid opinion and anyone that disagrees with you is a shill? Nice. How are you any better than the toxic youtubers? 
---
No, when you scroll around your wheel, any emotes you have differnet ones will highlight the "replace" key under the wheel. It's RB on XBox, not sure about pc or ps
---
I mean, why do you think that?
---
There's people that enjoy fighting other players and the challenge it brings, and that doesn't have to involve egos or anything like that.
---
Exactly. 
---
Stimpacks are free in survival mode
---
Enjoy it while you can.
---
I mean it's anecdotal evidence so I'm not going to make any assumptions off what someone claims happened. He also said 4 players were shooting at him, so I'm not sure what to think about that situation.
---
You know at first I like the idea of a train station safety zone but I‚Äôm afraid people would just abuse the shit out of that when PVPing. If they choose to do something like this I hope they also include a system where if you‚Äôre already in combat, and you or the other person is already attacking, that you cannot abuse the train station safety zone by retreating into it, to but instead have to finish your fight before the safety zone would enable.
---
I had someone follow me around while I was trying to level up. He wanted PvP. I wanted to level up. He kept running in front of me and killing everything before I could tag it hoping it‚Äôd piss me off and draw me into PvP. 
---
It‚Äôs not that they enjoy leveling your camp. They enjoy aggravating you. They‚Äôll find a way to do that. I guess it‚Äôs nice that slap damage is gone, but that was relatively harmless unless you were bloodied. Same thing with camp destruction. Inconvenient, but generally without too much consequence
---
I foresee a mass expansion of stealth/sniper builds, and campers stalking valult 76...
---
Hey, people can retaliate and come for my bounty. Thing is, they don't ;)
---
&gt; Ballistic Bock does not increase ballistic Heavy Weapon damage, such as .50cal Machine Gun, Minigun or LMG
---
Literally on my list :P
---
Thanks! I will!
---
In order to effectively use stealth boys I would need to spec into the perks to make them last longer else I'll be burning through them.
---
I haven't forgotten about them it's just annoying that I will absolutely need them in future play.
---
It will be much easier to just power level a character to snipe build than play melee when VATs removes aiming.
---
More like T.E.N.T
---
I tried to do that with a deathclaw one time and it was very anticlimactic, super mutants could be better tho since they actually have guns.
---
Have the fixed the flamer ammo crafting quantity yet? 
---
Survival Extreme allows players to drop legendary weapons and armor! 
---
I've been playing since launch on PS4. I have hundreds of hours of play time. I've been disconnected from the server maybe 6 times total and not once since late February. 
---
The game is significantly more fun than YouTube pundits would have you believe. It's also NOT a good competitive FPS, so managing expectations is important. 
---
If I gave them away, it wouldn't be spiteful... ;)
---
You do realise how percentages work ? 
---
This is so fucking disappointing. I was so excited for this mode too...
---
Try your parents first, they‚Äôre more likely to know how old you are. Either way, if you‚Äôre old enough I do recommend watching Dazed &amp; Confused, great film, plus you‚Äôll understand the reference.
---
Just checked and it‚Äôs a R - whatever that means in the US.
---
Oh so the god-geared people are now in a giant conspiracy to prevent fighting between themselves and to grief noobs.
---
Where?
---
https://imgur.com/a/87nRwPN
---
hehe pun
---
It isn't wishful thinking but it's actually a good decision because you want to start fresh and be fair against other players but it just seems Bethesda made a mistake when they gave the option to allow transferring characters.
---
Well, they are pouring resources into this still, considering all the content planned for many, many months ahead, so lending a few hands from another studio would not be too much to a leap for them at this point. 
---
That's spot on.
---
Ah on PC and don‚Äôt get that option..
---
I do see the "free" resources, but go over in gears/screws/aluminium, etc almost immediately.
---
That perk probably does make a huge difference, need to get me some levels for various QoL perks.
---
Yeah, it is much better, trust me. Especially if they are carrying missile launchers or miniguns!
---
I was wondering if that would affect Vats targeting, or only cosmetic?
---
I said VATs shouldn't be allowed in competitive PvP and you somehow think I just don't want to die? I could give two shits if someone kills me, but dying to someone because they can hit Q and instantly hit me is rather annoying.
---
You're probably one of those kids calling for bloodied nerfs because it's OP when actually it's quite balanced.
---
This would bring me back to the game.
---
We already departed far enough from the lore in this game, I remember those posts from months ago about how based on some terminals in the whitesprings bunker the whole game might be a military simulation. I hope they go all out with future updates and add the craziest shit imaginable
---
Uh, should be there, but now you‚Äôve got me doubting my memory. Maybe you do have to quit, but I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt. Sorry, don‚Äôt know now :)
---
Yup, but I think PvP is still something they don't plan to pay much attention to. 
---
Nope dying with full ap
---
I'm not quite sure why people are complaining about literal aim bot in a PvP mode? 
---
Heard that! I really hope to see more of this in the future. Meeting, seeing, playing, trading and socializing with random‚Äôs in the community is great. I‚Äôm hopefully Beth learned from this like we did and include more content styles to bring us to all together.
---
What about full pvp mode made you think a level 16 would survive? I'm not being sarcastic here. If you're not prepared for a fight every time you log in, then don't go survival. Also check your aid, you lost more than just caps.
---
&gt; Well, to start, I wouldnt get camped coming straight out of the vault on every server I joined. 
---
Fixes it just for you for the time it takes everyone to get powered up again.
---
Doesn't do fuck for people 6 months from now.
---
As someone who has hearing issues anything like this is helpful also I wish there were different pitches of sound effects in games as I have high frequency hearing loss so high pitch dialogue or noises are hard to pickup.
---
GUESS WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A TWO SHOT LMG HOARDED UP
---
No parents, sadly.
---
Dazed and Confused sounds like one of those silly american movies that try to be funny but only manage to be embarrassing, though.
---
You're not wrong, but there is a potentially interesting and rewarding survival rpg game underneath all of the mistakes they've made. They just need to do it correctly. 
---
The concussive force alone would kill you in a fridge. If you're far enough away from the blast, it's fallout you have to worry about.
---
Biggest issue I‚Äôve encountered is groups of players running around with zero caps. You kill them multiple times and receive no reward and yet I get killed once and lose 400+ caps (I‚Äôm lvl 207). Come on Bethesda! If I die to someone with no caps I should lose no caps, have this scale up to their level so if they‚Äôre lvl 70 and only have 130 caps then I only lose 130 caps. If they have the full 140 caps then I‚Äôm fine with losing 400+ as it‚Äôs a GG but otherwise it‚Äôs an exploit that needs attention imo.
---
Sure, that is obvious NOW.
---
But first thing when you read you lose "some" you don't think losing 99/100 items is "some", I'd think losing 10-30/100 is "some".
---
the point of you disliking VATS is because you can't benefit from it as someone with a long range weapon, because you are running a melee build, as you said. Everyone has VATS, and melee builds are already the strongest in PVE
---
I love the top3 stuff where it works. All the map action is concentrated around them. Kinda silly the right way to exp on survival is to make sure you die in safe spot every half an hour, but thats the way it is and survival is definitely the right place to exp if you take precautions.
---
As someone who has a character witha VATS Critical build. Vats is very unreliable at a far. And if you use a build that isnt vats reliant vats is even more unreliable. The only way vats is accurate is if you use half your AP so increase its accuracy or be within sniffing distance of some one. However the train Camping has got to go. Its super toxic and unfair. I now travel carrying no Aid to make sure people only get caps if they get me.
---
Well the aid sucks too, but that‚Äôs another matter.Thats a decision Bethesda made but not really related to game design ,if you see what I‚Äôm trying to say.
---
I mean,I get it.I see why they want deaths to matter.id just like to have some benefit for my levels I‚Äôve earned,instead of them just being a liability.Because that‚Äôs all they are right now.
---
Well, you would think wrong...
---
I guess you have to have complete assassin's armor. Need to reduce damage from players as well as deal more damage to them. Level 50 would be best before you try. 
---
Well this is interesting to discover. 
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs bullshit ! And that reply ? It‚Äôs crap behavior 
---
I'm pretty sure that every LMG in the game (both crafted and looted) comes with a muzzle break, but you can learn to make one through scrapping anyway. This might have changed in the past few months but I don't see why it would
---
It would be griefers paradise times three in a fresh start ^^
---
Much appreciated and very understanding of you!
---
Those idiotic youtube speedrunners, Takes the enjoyment out of the game for likes and views. And suddenly they‚Äôre the what kids these days listen to when it comes to what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs not. 
---
What‚Äôs funny is I watched one speedrun Resident evil 2 remake,  thinking he was a horror fan, apparently he never heard of the Aliens franchise. 
---
It just shows that most of these ‚Äúcontent streamers‚Äù have no idea or actual interest in the games they play. They just ride whatever‚Äôs new and speedrun it, I doubt they even bothered with the lore or understood the story.
---
Enter FO76, I wonder how they tried to speedrun it? Worlds first to 50? 100? No wonder they didn‚Äôt like it. Shits and giggles pissing contest..
---
I mean it's 3 points in agility and if you use it right effectively counters their whole build. You are going to have to be resourceful, use food, chems, anything to gain a slight advantage. 
---
You are 100% invisible:ish when in chameleon/stealth boy, no markers what so ever unless you holster your weapon which I guess is bugged?
---
Well the worst thing is I went to the nearest train station to avoid the cost of caps respawning too far away however spawning and seeing a player camp built with a turret wall facing the station, sitting there with an explosive sniper rifle that kills in two hits through power armour, costing a chunk of caps and dropping all my food and water is not okay. This isn't survival, it's a hot messy of toxicity. I joined because I thought it might be fun to add a bit of risk, not to get cheesed to death. Back to "adventure" mode I go.
---
I‚Äôm not really into griefing people‚Äôs bases for the hell of it but there are definitely toxic people in the PvE community aswell and they shouldn‚Äôt be safe to troll just by pressing a button. There‚Äôs consequences for everything.
---
And it‚Äôs missing for me as well 
---
&gt; He also said 4 players were shooting at him
---
No, not the post I'm talking about. He said nothing of 4 players.  He said he was invincible last night but today 5 bullets from a handmade killed him. And going by what I read, he was fully spec'd for PVP, or what most people thought was the meta for PVP. 
---
But I don't think a meta has been established because PVP itself is still in Beta. For all intents and purposes, there has been no real PVP in this game until today.
---
Like cool? but why? 
---
Long Range isn't the problem. Getting sniped will happen.
---
When I'm six feet away from someone and I hit them for 90% of their HP and they jump and instantly snap and one shot me it's when I have an issue. I lose this scenario not because I'm bad, not because they are better.. I lose because they have VATs.
---
Bugout76 always making me lul. üëåüèº
---
I agree for the nukes. I however think survival mode should remain on the map. As to keep players who don't want any part of it out of it. Yes I know that only those who volunteered to participate in it would be the only ones who could hurt each other but it would be confusing if a random pedestrian wandered through the middle of it. As for the nukes, I see no reason they need to be shown on the map. The sounds and warning make sense but after a nuke hits the radiation zone has large clouded walls on the edge of the zone. That means it would be obvious ly a nuke zone.
---
Besides some food and repairing my armor I found, I do zero crafting.  And my camp is.....there?  It‚Äôs there, and it has a pretty view.  I had friends to play with on day 1, but all have quit.  So while I prefer playing solo, I‚Äôm all alone when it comes to advice or going into any quest with help.  A spirit guide would be much better than my current situation 
---
I think that survival has to be really more hard. So no legendaries in it, this could solves many problems
---
Aint that nice? I mean you are setting ambush to them. I was in top 3 too and then I saw how other from top 3 started to hunt me, but what he didn't realize, he was the prey. So I took my step off the path and set ambush in the gas station and killed who ever tried to claim my position. Its pretty cool to be in top 3 and get paranoia of someone coming for you every moment. 
---
Sadly tho things like VATS and Berry Mentas, kill the atmosphere.
---
The dang glitches doing a nuke run will kill you... One night I had to recreate the ID card 3 times... Got all the way to opening the control room door... Blue Screened... I think they heard me screaming in Europe. 
---
&gt;This was a very sad attempt at a battle royale style.  
---
&gt;Bgs saw other games make billions so this is what they gave us.
---
What a dumb comment. I, and many others, have been waiting for PvP servers since "slap damage" was announced. This is nothing like a battle royale at all. 
---
Except you can't one shot through slap damage. It's not possible. Why are people still claiming this nonsense. 
---
This is a terrible idea. 
---
You‚Äôre playing survival mode to fight other players. That‚Äôs it. 
---
Say it with me! Level based matchmaking for survival! More equal power and caps payouts is the best solution.
---
Imagine any other pvp game with vats, broken
---
No, it‚Äôs not a zany comedy, it‚Äôs a moment in time (1976/77 I think) piece with humour, lots of drugs and great, great music (if you like music from that era), and Matt Mahogany in one of his best roles ever. 
---
Just by one shot?!
---
Go for it
---
Oof.  Guess that's pretty Bethesda.  Any tips on not getting killed while finding stars?
---
It is a good concept, though dialogue the Sole Survivor can have with Danse, Maxson and other BoS members paint (to me) Danse as being with the Brotherhood for quite a while. That and Maxson's realignment of BoS doctrines would have made recruiting Danse from Rivet City unlikely (I.e. no external recruitment until the Sole Survivor due to SS showing off certain skillsets helping Recon Team Gladius drive off the Cambridge ghouls and Danse recover the deep-space transmitter from ArcJet Systems).
---
I would have absolutely played survival if we had to start characters over and they were locked to that server. I am lvl 150 and would have no qualms about starting a new character on a survival mode.
---
 The whole swapping back-and-forth between game modes is beyond silly in my opinion.  Not sure how you can even call that a survival mode.
---
Let's put thousands of level 100+ people who finished every quest on a game mode with no PVP restrictions.
---
 It's not survival thats battle Royal.
---
can anyone dig new exp formula? looks like smthing not match
---
from 185 to 186 level i killed near 26 vertibots 1000 EXP for each
---
so its not 15880 per level but MORE
---
If I can ask, where are those terminals? I want to know everything of the Bunker and what happened to the previous Enclave members but I can't find anything 
---
Well in my opinion the dupes floating around arent really all that great post nerf, thats why i stated " there just like everything else"  I've found more useful 2* weapons that i used more than those things, i got one of each of those bad gear pre ban/nerf when i was a low lvl constantly dying farming at whitesprings when a lvl 300+ waved me to come over and i just kept running they followed and whacked me with a sledge, me being me i fought back and died but when i came to recover my loot, there were one of each of those in the bag.  
---
So yes i used them, enough to where i know how to use em and not die. But are they good enough to give me an advantage in PvP? Not really, because with all the perk points you have to spend for fire proof and dense mods to keep you from dying from it could have been spent else where, not to mention they are inaccurate and the explosive effects makes you less stealthy to other players. 
---
I can see where TSE's would be good in PvE where tagging mobs is a priority. But in PvP, unless you're specced for it and know how to use it your better off with assassins/AA. This though is just based upon my build and play style. 
---
Simple. Yeah people will enjoy fighting others. But when the odds are even on both combatants. People are moan and complain about the balance until BGS Austin nerfs and attempts to give said balance which will alway piss people off.  All we will get is the same 50+ people always in the same position. And everyone will just keep trying to brute force theirs way and when that fails they‚Äôll rage and the devs to step and that‚Äôll just repeat the same actions that are soon to come. 
---
Yeah. I've also noticed a rise in people going "I hate games with plot and story, I just want action." I've even see videos of YouTubers whinging because they were forced to watch a cutscene that explains the plot. 
---
A game like Fallout is like a weird layer cake of lore and exploration. The story and depth unfolds over time as you dig into the lore, holotapes, and other bits and pieces left around. For people who want action or to just go, go, go they're not going to get rewarded at all.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
I sold all my stimpaks yesterday ;~;
---
I don't see the problem. As a certified tuba player, I can assure you I am the only wind instrument there is
---
I dont think you understand how percentages work
---
I respect your opinion but disagree completely.
---
Yea. Maybe they want it so that wen you are in group or big event, you can swap it on and don't have to worry about shooting your friends.
---
That works too.
---
Yeah, forgot to add that part to, anyways I was in flatwoods, which is a place where most high levels wouldn't be in, I was prepared and all, but to find a team of 100s? I was ready to fight people, had my own black rifle, which could of dealt a lot of damage, pretty sure they were camping low levels 
---
I'm not complaining about far away VATs because I find that useless, I'm talking about snipers in close range with VATs. If someone sniped me from far away I wouldn't even know if they used VATs.
---
That‚Äôs crazy to think about. All that work for so little.
---
I tried.
---
Green hood will do it too
---
Nope.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs all right there. Claiming someone is entitled to their own opinion then dismissing it and saying their opinion is wrong 
---
I‚Äôve seen less than five confirmed rare masks across all platforms, but I‚Äôm sure just a few more than that might be floating around. Drops were just beyond being ridiculously rare.
---
Yes they said "we've removed it so you can't get one shot any more" 
---
But I have one shotted and been one shotted.
---
I feel like if you're 1st 2nd or 3rd on the leaderboards you should have some effect that reduces cap loss by %. 10% cap reduction on death for 3rd. 20% Cap reduction on death for 2nd and 30% cap reduction if you were in first. Just some type of incentive I think would be good especially since you're a walking target.
---
1st place: 30% Cap reduction on death.
---
These dudes were just shooting blindly at the spot people spawn and I would die in 2 bullets.
---
Dont think I was being vats crit.
---
Man, I hate to tell you... You can't. You only learn mods by scrapping. You have to find or buy the base plan. 
---
I have gotten credit for all legendary kills in events. Just get ready for a fight when event ends.
---
I wouldn't really consider it an Aimbot since it does take some skills to use the V.a.t.s.
---
So asking for balance in an online game is wrong. Gotcha.
---
This is why Snake from MGS stays in a cardboard box. 
---
Literally why would you go to Whitesprings? I don't even like PvP and I know better than to effectively take my underwear off and sit on an anthill. 
---
This is absolutely beautiful.
---
Good thing I had a two shot saved up in my stash box I can whip out and give a try! 
---
I might play survival if they were to get rid of vats and make a couple of other changes.
---
No, in survival there are less legendaries
---
Pretty much the same here. 
---
I started again this morning, actually. I am in the middle of finding the kidnapped kid and had to use a terminal. Unfortunately, the scorched decided to try to recreate D-Day and a random person held them off long enough for me to find the information. Of course, I did the same for him. 
---
Afterwards we exchanged thumbs up and went our separate ways. All in all, it was a pretty good experience. I‚Äôm glad that the douche bags appear to have left. 
---
So....
---
You had the duped stealth boys?
---
Orrrrr
---
You're just assuming that people were using duped stealth boys?
---
I have probably close to three dozen of them.... I'm not a duper. 
---
It‚Äôs this way for Xbox. Can‚Äôt speak for the rest. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong. 
---
Just get rid of the fucking legendary weapons, stealth boys, and VATS for survival mode. 
---
They are the sole purpose the imbalances exist. 
---
You can still have it be a loot grinder, but the ‚Äústars‚Äù for weapons should indicate ‚Äúrolls‚Äù for the weapons. So a 3* sledgehammer does more damage than a regular sledgehammer. 
---
That way you can flush out all the magical effect bullshit and we can fight on fairly balanced terms. 
---
Yeah, you‚Äôll need to tweak some numbers and PA might be a bit OP, but Doing the above would fix 90% of the problems. 
---
Jes√∫s. It‚Äôs not that fucking hard. 
---
I wanna see you spawn killing me when I spawn middle of the mire. Because as I told you can go into adventure mode, walk away from spawn point and then play survival mode like you would. 
---
They had me at ‚ÄúKing Shit of Turd Island‚Äù. 
---
This! 
---
I'm not talking about range only. As you get your damage from your perks and from bloodied and you make your build around that, some people do the same with VATS and its related perks. Hitting someone at melee range requires as much aim as a VATS shot, and same with damage multipliers. You get bonuses having low hp, but you can go with power armor. Rifle builds get the dmg from going with shitty light armor but having a better stealth, etc.
---
I'm sorry, that's my bad for skimming it, should have used CTRL+F to search for it :) Thank you!
---
At the very least make event items and other repeatedly earnable stuff be droppable or destroyable. It‚Äôs silly that we can‚Äôt get rid of those Battle Bot keycards...
---
This is how it should be done. New characters for survival, and no legendary weapons. Give survival mode a sense of realism this way. If you have a sledgehammer in survival it should just be a sledgehammer. Not some legendary sledgehammer that does double the damage.
---
My camp has no locks. Its an open fortress for all to use. If you want to rest and gear up to kill me there, so be it. Just do not destroy needlessly.
---
Just know i know where the hidden entrance is.
---
I dont understand the idea with letting your character go back and forth between modes. 
---
How many times did you die? It might depend on how much you have. 
---
So where does the ego come into play, then? 
---
Let people enjoy fighting each other. I don't think anyone has criticized your playstyle in the game.
---
No problem thanks anyway!
---
Enclave just hides in a bunker and does nothing.
---
Or maybe they do something cool, I dunno.
---
**When you go to the bathroom and come back as a top player on the leaderboards.**
---
handmade plans are static on watoga train station vendor. just keep one of the combat rifles that drop no big difrence while leveling compared to the handmade.
---
The only solution is that if a player takes down another player that has lost a fight would not lose caps but the player that has won the fight will be rewarded with caps by the system in the game instead because no one likes it when you take stuff from other people that have earned it.
---
No... V.a.t.s is an Aimbot. All you have to do is hit the bumper, target whatever is near you, hit trigger button. That takes no skill what-so-ever 
---
I can agree that spawn killing is completely, utterly fucked. There is absolutely zero room for argument or debate about this, it‚Äôs literally a broken feature.
---
There's some terminals you can access in the Enclave bunker as a part of the I Am Become Death quest line. In them there's entries from an Enclave Officer who believes that the world is a simulation and the only way to escape is by nuking an "exit" site in China. 
---
Really?  I could have sworn I saw someone selling the service to craft marine helmets until you could learn it from scrapping it...
---
Damn... what a waste... :|
---
I wouldn't come off so strong if it actually was an opinion though. 
---
FO76 survival has nothing in common with BR games aside from unrestricted PvP. There are certain elements that make a BR game, that are no where present in this game. 
---
I would argue there are even more toxic people in the PvE community, in fact.
---
But the gear they have would be legit. If they took the time to earn that gear and I know it wasn't duped it's not as frustrating. 
---
Sunnytop Station isn't that far from Abbie' Bunker.
---
Complaints have been out for less than a day. People need to stop complaining about people complaining about the Survival Mode BETA.
---
&gt;Bring on the downvotes for my honesty.
---
Not for your honesty but for your holier than thou attitude and narsistic view of the world... 'If I don't like it, nobody should'. Sorry, but a lot of us just dont seem to have the same issues as you do...nor did we level up at ~30 levels a week. Maybe, just maybe, you plowed through without actually playing the game, just farming XP?  
---
Cool.  Any suggestions on where to mine combat rifles for mods then?
---
Who thought binge drinking would save my life.
---
Did you do anything to get this?
---
this should be in the base game 
---
I'll have to test that lol
---
Most importantly if you flirt and they are uncomfortable, don't flirt back, or ask you to stop you've gotta full stop right there.
---
Don't be a creeper üåà‚≠êÔ∏è
---
Top players killed and wanted players being visible makes more sense than longest life for sure. 
---
I hope in this round of balancing assassin's sentinel/cav gets a massive nerf
---
It's fun. But it isn't simple to use, to be honest. Depending what you're using. It's really the weapons that are taking you down easily, V.A.T.S. only help aim at fast hostile.
---
Shit. I've been busy with work, I haven't had a chance to check it out.
---
You do realize that VATs literally auto aims for you and as long as they don't go out of your field of view it tracks them right?
---
The scenario I'm purposing happened, I nearly one shot someone and they jumped with marsupial (which gets them out of my melee range) and instantly snapped and dropped me with one shot. Had that person not press Q the chances of them dying were a lot higher.
---
I understand VATs is a staple of Fallout and that's fine but auto aiming has never been good in video games.
---
The only other game that I know that has it in competitive play is Overwatch and that only lasts for roughly 10 seconds every 2-3 minutes. 
---
So you're saying that power armor isn't useful in survival mode on?
---
With Grape Mentats and the Rank 3 Barter perk, I think the plans were around 1500 caps. It uses 5.56 and hits pretty hard. Might weigh less than a .308 rifle after all is said and done depending on perks. Also the Handmade can't use the Recon Scope so if you're set on that it might be a deal breaker.
---
Ah yeah hadn't considered that dick move. Only a server hop away but still a pain in the arse regardless. 
---
Now would probably be a good time to put this Assassin's Explosive pump shotgun on the market.
---
H: Assassin's Explosive Pump Shotgun
---
W: 25k 
---
scorched or mutants on higher lvl drops them alot unlike handmade that is basicly only from SB's
---
FYI there's no PVP debuff for being broke on caps in survival!
---
The same thing happened to me but when I removed my Owl mask my actual head disappeared lol
---
[https://i.imgur.com/bzoHxhC.png](https://i.imgur.com/bzoHxhC.png)
---
Glad I'm not the only one that was like "Damn that S#*t is loud"
---
I got a rock.
---
&gt; It's the same load on the server
---
You can't say that with any degree of certainty.  Computers are complicated.
---
Only the combat and metal helmets work that way as far as I know. Weapons and armor you have to learn to craft from a plan. You got him a few mods unlocked though I‚Äôm sure lol
---
So essentially features that the game needed from launch. 
---
Work on the phsyics, story and NPC's instead. Yikes.
---
Is it still possible to return this game? 80 euros? Whatta joke.
---
Make way for the drama queen.
---
Well, my guess, since this is Fallout, people would naturally get blood thirsty when given a weapon and a target. Plus, since the vault dwellers of Vault 76 are competitive people (so competitive that they would fight over a trophy of having the best dental hygiene, don't remember if it was physical or not), after being in a vault for 25 years or their whole lifetime (depending on the character), they would go out and hunt down their rivals and eventually become blood thirsty and create an unofficial contest of (insert random thing here).
---
That's my take on it, anyway.
---
They said well before release items can't be passed between characters, could always get a mutual 3rd party to trade though i spose 
---
For Xbox, yes.
---
I just killed my 2nd 3* 
---
It flat out disappeared....... nothing.
---
way to turn your criticism into casual bigotry
---
Did you try applying it? I know for CAMP items as long as you have the mats it seems like you can craft something from the shop even if you don't have it unlocked. But if you click it, it takes you to the shop to purchase it. 
---
Didn't realize about the scope.  Loved that scope in past games.
---
Big bend tunnel is my go to spot.
---
They said all the griefers would stay in Adventure because they wouldn‚Äôt want the stand-up challenge in Survival.  
---
Turns out, griefing is easier when you can do damage. 
---
Wait, did I say griefing?  I mean my ‚ÄúRoleplaying as a raider‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a legitimate strategy within the rules‚Äù.  You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have remembered that with how many times people schooled me on how there‚Äôs no griefing in 76.  
---
I walked in with 5 stims, 0 caps and a lead pipe. Nobody even bothered with me because im just a lvl 2 who ran around butt naked trying to pipe whack everybody. Came out with 30 stims, and some brotherhood under armour and a decked out brotherhood rifle along with ammo. 
---
Why not? 
---
And suddenly spawn killing is gone? My apologies how could I be so dumb! Of course! My bad friend I didn‚Äôt realise it was as simple as j u s t walk away. In all seriousness this doesn‚Äôt solve the fact that spawn killing can be done and ruin the experience.
---
I mean in survival you shouldn't have more than 12 on you tbh. You can lose anything so it makes you travel like your life savings depends on it. I have no issue with that loss rate.
---
tbh someone getting sucker punched by a melee build, jumping above and killing its attacker is what I call someone playing better than you.
---
No, I was just modding my PA and there it was
---
How do you people have budget for all of this!?! I feel like if I put build one wall I take up half my goddamn budget. TEACH ME
---
Same thing happens on regular servers! People get wanted and if they don't have caps it doesn't matter. I stopped going after wanted for that very reason. 
---
Wow I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, I actually just made a post dedicated to zero cap PvP exploiting in the hopes of getting a response from a community manager. I‚Äôd really like to hear from Bethesda on if this is something they‚Äôre actively working on or not. Thanks for dropping some knowledge on me tho!
---
So even without knowing the base plan, he would still have gotten mod unlocks?
---
I pity you...going through life like that must really suck. A word of advice, not that you'll take it most likely, but instead of stoking your hate find something you enjoy and do that for a while. All that hate is going to burn you up kid.
---
I'm not saying it's exactly like a Battle Royal, this is bethesdas version of the battle Royal in a fallout universe.
---
 If they didn't want it to be a complete free-for-all kill everybody they would have never put a longest living leader board.  So basically you have a target painted on your back because you haven't been killed the longest.
---
 So if you're the sneaky type of player who tries to avoid pvp but wanted added danger of other players in the world you are basically screwed because the game will show you on the map. 
---
 Any kind of leader board is going to have that happen.
---
The also wouldn't have put everybody who has already over level 100 and completed every single quest on a server with unrespected PVP. Honestly what else is there to do besides kill other players when you have done everything else in the game?
---
I‚Äôd gladly compensate ur troubles with caps ;)
---
Yea
---
Sounds like a challenge to overcome.
---
Oh, lucky :)
---
Why did the rich people in Pleasant Valley start killing one another? The vast majority of the Pleasant Valley Raiders used to be extremely wealthy, civilized men and women. 
---
Easy; base instincts kick in. Survival of the fittest. Frightened and hungry, the need for self preservation overrides all existing beliefs and ideals. The human form becomes a machine, its only goal to continue its existence no matter what.
---
It makes sense, really. These people lived in automated comfort for half a lifetime. Some were born in the Vault and had perfect upbringings. When inserted into hell on Earth, they can't mentally cope, so they pick up a sharp rock and start doing whatever they can to survive. Working together would logically get them back to their lives of ease and comfort, but these people aren't thinking logically.
---
Duh.
---
I hope so. I killed 3 random 3* legendaries yesterday while looking for plans, and no joke, got 3 1* wood pieces.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs different in Survival imo because you can‚Äôt opt out of PvP. 
---
Super off topic, but I'm curious about your mention of deployment. How do they determine who in a.. platoon/fire team/squad(?) carries the SAW, and did you get specific training with it before you deployed or did they just kinda hand it to you there and be like "Hey... youre using this now"
---
I hope you can too.
---
Seriously, whoever still gets wrecked by TSE weapons does something wrong. I can‚Äôt believe this is still an issue for some players. 
---
I did, and it got applied like normal. I walked around the PA station a little to check if it actually works (and it did) then I instantly removed it from my chasis
---
No, not really because that's literally just a natural reflex as soon as he would've landed I would have killed him unless he had the reflexes of Shroud. Well I suppose he did since the only thing better than Shroud is aimbot.
---
B-b-b-b-b-but they're raiders! For ***IMMERSION***. GOD!! Quit being whiny!! 
---
(Btw, that was sarcasm, in my honest opinion, that was fucked up of them to do that to low level players and they're probably the same type of people who would make that excuse that I mocked.)
---
It's not an exploit. It's an intended game mechanic. PVP is supposed to come with dangers and risks. There's risk that you'll lose caps if you die in PVP, there's risk that you gain very little if you win if the person you killed is broke. 
---
Main issue is trust.
---
Yeah its a death match. Battle Royale implies other game mechanics that aren't present i.e. no character progression, spawning/dropping in, spawning in with no weapons and looting, etc. This is just a deathmatch server with a leaderboard. 
---
Yeah but it would be the same situation after like two days if they had required people to make new characters.  Unless you don't have a life it's impossible to be "competitive" in that way.  They need a proper player-matching system, and not just for survival mode.
---
To be fair i think it might be intentional so melee ppl can get a kill somehow ;)=
---
99.99% is still technically some.
---
Look on the bright side, after you lose 99.99% of your aid items on the first death, what do you really have to lose on the second?
---
Only 99.99% of 0.01%!
---
No turrets! Also having my base flat against the dam let me have it flat and featureless on one side which saved build budget.
---
Not worth it to buy the plan. Just find a legendary, they don‚Äôt have anything worth learning from scrapping
---
V.a.t.s is simple and on any other competitive platform v.a.t.s or anything like it would be considered cheating. 
---
Big facts
---
Why 
---
When you complete the Enclave quests you eventually get access to some computers in the Whitespring bunker that will allow you to track a Vertibot carrying a card. You need to blow it out of the sky which can be a massive pain if you‚Äôre a melee build. 
---
Well its not working. Cause this guy would be easily out of arms reach. 
---
Idk, I'm not gonna use it anyway since I didn't buy it and it feels ( And is tbh ) cheating
---
Nah I'm just going to level up a sniper. No reason to try to melee build when both spawn camping is a thing and VATs in close range is a thing.
---
I don't have the energy to redo my build for constant stealth boys.
---
Why would a true fallout player want to bother with pvp to start with ? It is the province of call of duty and fortnight rejects. Cast offs that couldent have it and want to still be internet tough guys. Frankly it makes me slightly ill. Fallout was never meant to be a pvp game. The fact that 76 was turned into such is a commentary on the current world today. People who cant act out in reality, sociopaths that, if not for the punishments dolled out by society would act on their need to be bullies, and thieves. Argue all you want, it wont change my opinion. Fallout was never meant to be this way and is only so cause so many people jumped from other sandbox games to this one and abused the actual intention of the game
---
Nothing wrong with not knowing and perusing the world. Glad you‚Äôre enjoying the game!
---
I like how they add locations without telling anybody. It feels like it was always there but you never found it before.
---
Yes. I have a stack of 60 of one key, and a separate stack of one of the same key that I can‚Äôt drop any of. It was a keycard from the mayor for a day questline, pretty sure the server was lagging when I picked them up
---
Aliens SHOULD be at the crashed spaceship 
---
No, the limited traveling is great, it makes you walk more around the world and see more things. It gives game much better taste than this teleport here, teleport there, teleport back. 
---
&gt; Why not mark the people who are killing the most on the server? 
---
Because then top 3 people would be always the same players. Right now it is nice. You are doing quests or events, walking around the world and then you get to top 3 and things get interesting. Now you aren't just walking around, now you are walking around with target on your back and you never know when someone might jump on you and that makes interesting situations. Also player who are actively seeking to kill other player wont have any loot. They know they are going to be in PVP asap, means they might lose the loot, so there is no point them to pick up the loot along the way. And when they score the kill, they just gonna go back to camp and empty their inventory and start looking for kill again. 
---
OK then yes you are correct. They should have named it death match server, not survival.
---
 Had they just left the game alone with unrestricted PVP and made you start a new character I would have been all for it.
---
 This death match type mode as you call it  Is just not my thing.
---
My idea of a survival game compared to this are miles apart.
---
I had always hoped they would adopt a system that would increase rare drop probability on harder to pick locked containers. So bizarre no Bethesda game has had that up until now.
---
3 points in agility would require me to remake my build.
---
That or get rid of White Knight and actually have to farm fiber.
---
this feature should have been possible from day 1. instead, bethesda encourages players to pass them in game through 2 accounts. or a friend to hold while you swap characters. i use my friends disc who stopped playing to pass items between accounts to get them on my 2nd main acct character. encouraging players to use 2 accounts is encouraging mule's for storage. not sure how that makes any sense.
---
static spawn points if melee just sits and swings anyone that spawns will get killed b4 they can move just like many both range and melee are abusing right now. In world pvp though a melee will never be able to kill me.
---
oh god did you not read the patch notes before you loaded in? Why would you carry 1k stims?!
---
I'm not against teaming but maybe look into how to balance the scenario where you are going up against 3-4 people while you are on your own. I would prefer the teaming aspect to come from things like Faction wars, where Raiders/Brotherhood/Enclave people can team up with people that chose the same faction as you. 
---
&gt;I hope in this round of balancing assassin's sentinel/cav gets a massive nerf
---
I saw someone today complaining that they died quickly in assassin's cav after being invincible last night.  Probably not because of an armor nerf but increased weapon damage in PVP which Bethesda described in the patch notes. I don't play survival, just been reading the comments on here. 
---
Seems some people who went into this thinking they had a meta build for PVP discovered otherwise. 
---
For some I could see it being a matter of being broke, especially lower levels. But multiple lvl 70+ with no caps seems a little far fetched. If Betheda wants to make it to where everyone just dumps their caps on mules then they‚Äôre doing a great job with the current rules. I know Bethesda doesn‚Äôt like the concept of mule characters tho so this issue needs addressing imo. 
---
Like I said I‚Äôm fine with risking my caps aid and junk upon death, but when others aren‚Äôt doing the same then there‚Äôs something wrong with the system imo.
---
Other V.A.T.S??
---
Yeah the real question is why carry that many stims.
---
Rule of thumb: if you don't see a treasure map, plan or technical data in a 3 tier safe. Walk away dont take anything out of it. When you server hop pick it again to reroll the loot.
---
Nukashine is great for low level players - a lvl 15 finding themselves in the cranberry bog while overloaded with junk? what could be more fun!
---
I thought for sure I had accidentally chosen survival or something. That noise really made me jump! Now I have to remember to not put headphones on until I‚Äôve logged in. (PS4 here as well) 
---
Did the mission as a team, and only one of us got the ultracite power armor as a reward.  I'm level 100+ now, and not having this armor is irritating.  Today Bethesda advertises a new ultracite armor skin in the Atomic Shop and it's absolutely useless to me.  Even though I enjoy the game, it is hard to believe that a professional game developer feels proud about their (sometimes functional) accomplishments.  There is more to accomplish than just making money, a fully functional product is an accomplishment. 
---
Oh shit. I didnt even think about this aspect. Clearly OP is a true entrepreneur. Set up C.A.M.P with vending machines near one of the train stations for players who switch to adventure mode after being killed.
---
Try making both the Launcher and the Updater (I believe, it's two of the four .exe functions) have the Vista SP2 compatability and set to run as admin.  Doing only the launcher didn't work for me, but doing both did.
---
The more mule accounts you have, the more "players" they can claim to be playing the game.
---
It's a game mechanic that Bethesda is currently testing, possibly for potential abuse, and could be changed, like everything in the BETA. If everyone starts doing it, you can bet it will be changed. 
---
share your platform and username.
---
They hit hard, but ammo is too rare/expensive/heavy, launchers break much too fast to be useable as primary. I bust them out when there‚Äôs a good cluster of enemies, but it‚Äôs a massive waste to use them on single targets. 
---
However, you can make a very solid heavy/explosive combo build, they synergize very well, use heavies for most targets and bust out explosives when there‚Äôs groups of enemies. 
---
Also it synegizes fantastically if you get your hands on a furious/bloody/aa/TS + explosive heavy gun.
---
Thanks, I guess I‚Äôll see how much it is. What do you reckon the chances of finding a legendary are?
---
I'd always use two guns for a pure rifle build. One slower-firing and high damage for the stealth headshot sniping, plus a pure dpm rifle for emergencies. The handmade's ideal for the latter, so if you're going in that direction then there's no reason not to buy the plan as soon as you have the grape mentats.
---
&gt;Somebody disagrees with my completely subjective opinion, and thus, must be a shill for a corporation!
---
Oi i forgot to put it in thx
---
I‚Äôm on now
---
I read all of them...but first I didnt get killed by a person.  Second: over 1k! I just wanted to try it, and didnt think losing 40+ would be a big deal. If it happens on any death, then again my bad, but  WOW.
---
Yeah but 90% of the map was taken by people so you would spawn near a person.
---
I am just saying, that there is solution to avoid spawn killing, but if one is so stupid not to use it, its is your own fault for being so stupid.
---
Tried the beta.  Got one shotted repeatedly at my camp.  Returned to adventure mode, and my Furious Explosive Handmade was missing.  The beta ate my favorite, probably irreplaceable, gun.  
---
Well it is not as easy as just killing random players not set up for pvp and then thinking your badassüòÄ
---
well they're not getting those numbers out of me. all my friends quit anyway so using their accounts to pass my items isn't giving them any increase in user numbers lol
---
I agree with you, everyone should have had to start over. Also I didn't mean to be a pedantic dick, I just don't think this is a money grab attempt but something that players actually wanted. 
---
It's actually fragmentation, not shrapnel. Shrapnel is a type of projectile shell.
---
I can understand the complaints about the train station camping, but I agree with OP on this one. When I saw limited spawn locations, I instantly knew that I could ONLY spawn at my camp. Every pvp game I have ever played has spawn campers, why would this be different? Main suggestion I see on the numerous posts on here is make it a safe zone. Won't work. You will have campers waiting for you to exit, and you will have people sitting in the safe zone waiting for you to leave so they can murder you.
---
Nooo! Go into "manage game and applications" option for FO76, and clear **only** your reserved data. You'll be able to pog in right after.
---
You're "saved data" holds your photos, so don't use the "delete all" option unless you're ok losing pics
---
Excellent. I love the interior place. Looks really livable. 
---
Assassin Sentinal Armor. 
---
Orbital Strike Beacons are weapons, but aren't affected by Ordnance Express, or legendary armour's weapon weight reductions.
---
Ummm, actually, the handmade is more of an AK74 than the AK47. (5.56vs7.62x39x5.45 for the real AK74) 
---
My favorite part was the pvp war RIGHT when it ended  after you look thru bags of course.
---
Gosh that was  fun. Had about 13 people shooting each other once.
---
I got the beret on my first try and then when I went back to play my character was deleted somehow and I lost hours an hours of gameplay
---
Check it now you can return to vault faster. 
---
Yeah I get that.
---
 If someone betrays your trust and kills you you only have to die once then you never have the team up with that person again.  On the other hand maybe you'll meet a teammate for life.
---
About 80-90%
---
Just the tip
---
Yeah I am not sure what tweaks was made to the damage but my game seemed to be first to fire wins.
---
In Fallout 76 there are fully in-tact buildings a mere mile away from a leveled city. Trees large enough to be hundreds of years old, which is understandable given how they don't so much as sway a as if caught in a breeze when nuked over and over and over again...
---
I‚Äôm level 90 and got destroyed when I spawned at whitesprings, lost 800 caps before I said fuck it and left without my junk, just people hiding with chameleon and TSE shotguns. I guess I just gotta got Gud 
---
It would eliminate any chance whatsoever of any duped items being brought into the new world. 
---
Match making with 10+/- levels would be ideal.
---
Yeah I get the Beta aspect of it and I‚Äôm more interested in them working on fixing server stability and game performance before smaller issues, I really just wanted to make a post to bring it to light for any that didn‚Äôt know and also hopefully to get a response from one of the community managers that this is something they‚Äôre looking into. I can appreciate the idea of patience tho and this ain‚Äôt game breaking by any means, still needs addressing tho imo.
---
Based on posts I'm seeing, it looks like people who went into this thinking they were built for PVP are getting slaughtered.  A guy was complaining that he got killed in assassin's cavalier armor and last night he was invincible.    This patch included re-balancing he wasn't ready for lol.
---
I don‚Äôt need it
---
I NEED IT
---
That looks great. My biggest problem with the camp is I can‚Äôt find any wall plans and I hate the wood ones. 
---
I bet somebody fat fingered the percentage and put 100 instead of 1.00.
---
It was a rare night all around, I spawned in to a cargobot flying around over my camp right when I was in need of a shiny new keycard, then the Flatwoods alien showed up as I was looting the cargo, leaving behind his lingering ghost after being killed by myself and another player, and while all this was happening, I had seven high level honeybeasts attacking my base. I came out of that whole thing with a day's worth of loot .
---
It could just be me but I would argue it is simple to use. I don't have any perks for vats but lately when I hit vats for a very split second i have always had a 95% to hit. So long as I hit both triggers on my controller within a split second of one another I'm guaranteed a hit (sometimes even through a wall or dirt). It's not even about timing either i literally just click one trigger then the other and I've hit, players, bots, and mobs even if they are fairly far away.
---
Because I played low health, and so want just a little boost...I have weight reduction on all chems but not in my stash...no room. I simply collected over time and used them a lot.
---
The broadsider made it here after all 
---
Yeah, I used to have a lot of fun building at workshops... I even would build resource extractors even though I never use them myself.
---
It's a shame.
---
No worries.   I would play survival if they changed the leader board.
---
 I played earlier made my way to 3rd because I was exploring places for legendaries.  I don't actively search for PvP and logged off because I didn't feel like being hunted with the map target.
---
FYI, that debuff does not exist in survival!
---
It‚Äôs so fun 
---
Wow this is well done
---
If anyone needs stimpaks on PS4 please let me know.
---
This has always urked me. Has no one at bethesda ever built a fence? A fence post goes at least a couple feet into the ground normally, just like the way the foundations do.
---
I've bought the pack and I ain't got the shotgun camo...Nice one Bethesda üëèüëè
---
Institute chatter
---
They should ban all legendary weapons and armor on survival mode. The goal was to make it survival-y and it would do that.
---
Just a thought but to make weapons not over powered, make it so that every time they are repaired they go down in durablility until they don‚Äôt last forever. This makes having a single overpowered weapon less overpowered
---
Don't know if you needed to add the "Duh." Anyway, I wouldn't correlate the two scenarios. The dwellers are pretty fresh out. They were supplied and prepared to some small degree for the surface, versus the shock and trauma of the surface dwellers.
---
Also, reading their memos, many people banded together and functioned with a managable livelihood, pre-scorch. It wasn't until overwhelming odds or enviromental factors washed over their progress thst many broke apart. Dwellers in control vaults are the ultimate cohabittors.
---
Timewise, the dwellers wrists haven't been twisted to pure pychotic breaks. Our glorious overseer is a great example. Despair, confusion sure but a tenacity and moral foundation through  and through.
---
Solution: A scorchbeast flies down and picks up high level players and carries them off to the great unknown.
---
Well yes, you don't need White Knight for PvP. The fact you have white knight actually worries me. The people you will be fighting in survival servers are fully min maxed. If all of your SPECIAL points are optimized you will be at a disadvantage. For example, every skill point I have directly affects my damage or defenses, which a few towards sneak. No crafting skills, no QoL skills, strictly damage/defenses.
---
It can take a hot minute to load but it is in that menu you screenshot.
---
Still, if a player grinds the parade event every day it is available, they ought to have had a high chance to end up with every item made available through that event. I actually had this week off, grinded the event every day until it ended, and still couldn‚Äôt get even the beret or a donut recipe, let alone a rare mask. I personally don‚Äôt mind so much as I think the masks are just kind of a waste of space, but I just feel bad for buddies of mine who actually lost sleep trying to get the rare masks and got nothing from it, and more so for those who would have liked to try but couldn‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt have the time to take off like I do. 
---
&gt; Existing characters can go into survival mode
---
Oh look exactly what everyone did NOT want to happen... welp looks like I'll never play that shitty game mode... I was looking forward to getting back into the game after a few months of not playing. Looks like Bethesda is still making shitty decisions so I'll wait til it's dead and gone and wait for the modders to actually make a decent game since Bethesda cant.
---
Oh, what a good idea for a new character...
---
That sounds like a bug. Apparently, people complain about 0% when using V.A.T.S. but given a few seconds and it locks on to enemies. I do not know why they even make it like that.
---
I know they had some kind of issue with the Mothman headlamp before so I wouldn't be surprised if it's just another bug.
---
Yeah, that would be a much better change.
---
Lol, yeah. I mean you dont find those things when rummaging through abandoned buildings all the time.
---
I'm amazed this is so much stuff implemented  on this rather small update.
---
Being on the bugs!
---
If you got the wild wasteland perk, you found his dead skeleton body in a refrigerator shortly outside of good springs. His hat gives you +1 luck
---
Glad It's Fallout &amp; Not the Lottery, but Thank You for the Input !
---
You got that backwards friend... projectiles and explosives that are designed to cause shrapnel are generally referred to as fragmentation munitions and are designed to fragment I to shrapnel. Shrapnel is also what things that get blown apart turn into 
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shrapnel
---
The best runs were always the ones where people were dressed up and participating in the parade itself. 
---
I really hope we get morr events like these.
---
I feel bad people think spawn killing and using exploits to stay top 3 on the leader board is fun! I found this one rez killer hiding safely under his concrete foundation like a lilttle bitch... ran into a well known cheater / expoliter Uber something that sells dev. room stuff in the bazaar etc. his ass was cheating like he always does! LOL
---
When the community is small and desperate enough they'll be nice to anyone to who shows up to try and convince them to stay. You see it a lot in dying mmos.
---
PS4 is limited to under 50
---
Constructive criticism: Survival Mode is fantastic in theory (I actually enjoyed it) but the main issue is the players still using Assassin/Sentinel builds along with multiple mutations all at once. Two Shot Explosive weapons are OP as hell. I'm starting to come to the conclusion that an Assassin's Combat Armor build should be a definite use for Survival Mode. But until Bethesda fixes some things (Water/Food meter going down way to fast/Food rotting to quickly) I'll stay in Adventure Mode.
---
Slight rant: Currently when you die you drop nearly everything Aid wise. I lost over 3,000 caps due to 3 grifers assaulting my C.A.M.P. with bullshit builds. I was actually assisting a few Responders/Brotherhood soldiers with protecting low level players.
---
All in all I like the concept of Survival Mode but it needs a lot tweaking.
---
I sent you a friend request
---
Yes Drop Rate I Read Was 0.03%
---
This post has me QUAKING 
---
I love showing up for those and lobbing Molotovs into the crowds. 
---
they worked for the blast itself but the shelter never gave the all clear, their flesh boiled off their bones due to the radiation.
---
Or so I've been told, I don't know if that has been retconned. 
---
Me too, I think that they want us to make speculations on this new locations
---
Agreed they nerfed tse into the groud learn counters instead of complaining to bethesda start with flame proof perk.
---
I Did See a Pic of Someone Wearing It, But After Being In the Event at Least 150 Times I Have Not Personally Seen One.

---
White Knight was solely for 3 points of agility for AP.
---
I suck  I always need stims lol
---
Yeah, that almost sounds like New Vegas, IIRC. 
---
I just used the taunt  then slashed someone. If they got their weapon out I'd get close and vats them. 
---
Honestly that pvp was a lot of fun. Idk how I feel about survival
---
It's the choice I've made to be stealth. I have sacrificed other beneficial elements in this endeavor. 
---
Im just glad that i got the donut and sausages from the event
---
I used a newish character for survival. Was basically left alone until I became #3 on the board and after that was left alone again to do events and the main quest. Even teamed up with a level 40 to do Feed the People, and helped him take down a level 68. I agree that having the markers be for longest living is silly, it really should be for most kills or something, but so far survival hasn't been as nightmarish as people made it out to be.
---
700 plastic in bulked form on another. Seven. Hundred.
---
It triples the time you're under the influence.
---
I figured it was a bug but that just shows that vats needs some fixing up too:\
---
When I go into the Bethesda launcher, it says I'm up to date. I hit "PLAY" and it tries to start Fallout, loads part of the first intro screen, then crashes back to my desktop completely. Multiple restarts. Sigh.
---
This is why everyone should have started survival at 0 level. 
---
The tense atmosphere and increased inventory management you get from the threat of other players is actually really cool, this really feels like a survival mode. Unfortunately playing normally I got top survival time twice, and both times someone in power armor 100+ came by to kill me. Discouraging as a new character to tackle larger "dungeons" knowing ill likely end up top 3/marked on the map before I can realistically complete some bigger locations. Not to mention there are vultures picking off the new characters at most popular stations making it pretty hard to get back to what you were doing 
---
I forgot that was even a possibility! That's so kind of you. If no one has the plans I will dm you about doing this :) 
---
I was more talking to the guy who responded to you. He sounded like a zero caps guy. Too many of them, and it gets patched out. Everyone's so smart. 
---
No. That chem fiend. Party boy increases benefits thats why nukashine does 300% unarmed
---
Completely agree with this! I noticed an event popup for Fasnacht wherever I was on the map during that event, so even just something like that when SBQ event is activated would be good.
---
Sadly all the whiners will move back to adventure because they can't handle real pvp... 
---
It's pvp mode and people kill to lead the score board. It's safe to assume no where is safe. 
---
Thank you for this post, I didn‚Äôt even think about that. I went out earlier with all my stuff on me. 
---
New game mode, hide and seek.
---
My vote goes for option number 1. Personally I'd be fine if neither player lost any caps until both players have enough to pay the full price.
---
I went there to grind out legendaries today. I got killed by a stealth sniper.
---
Then it might be time to change your play style. Instead of rushing people pop a stealth boy to get rid of their vats use. Stealthboys dont affect your AP and they cant target you.
---
It just needs to go back to 0% and you'll be fine.
---
Ah yes, at work today I wish I had a big bucket...like 5 gallon size, of popcorn as I watched all the whine threads. It reminded me of just after the exploit fix, any of them, I keep getting one shot by a [insert uneducated insult attempt] while I own a settlement, and of the current I want end game items for 1k caps mindset. The notes were great and spelled it out for anyone who had brain cells that read them. This mode was meant for people to be, for lack of better words, asshats so that adventure mode could be more of PVE. 
---
With that being said I have yet to play the new mode but I dont see myself spending most of my time in survival. It is nice to have a break stuff server though for when I feel the need to go against human intelligence. It will be interesting to see what changes unfold as the beta becomes non-beta. 
---
PS I was shaking my head yes as I read this whole post. 
---
Then shouldn't it read is triples the duration?
---
Time isn't an effect 
---
Well, I started in pacifist mode so people got used to me spamming them. Then I switched pac off and went crazy.
---
I'm on if you want to play. I can't join you because of your settings. 
---
I have one...500 Caps 
---
i agree it would have been better if everyone started again and if that character was survival only
---
You misunderstand. I killed several players and we were evenly matched. Then I died and respawned in at white springs train station. The guy I was fighting was standing on the spawn point, and melee killed me the second I loaded in. 
---
The developers intended players to be invincible for some amount of time when respawning to prevent exactly that from happening. It‚Äôs in the patch notes. That feature is not working. I had no period of invulnerability, and got repeatedly spawn killed. 
---
Ha that's great.
---
One time the pvp got so 'bad' or went on for 40 min lol
---
Exactly this man said it. Restarting doesn‚Äôt solve the problem if you can‚Äôt handle survival don‚Äôt play it. Bot only that its not fair to force players to restart if they dont want too
---
Honestly it should be the top 3 kill leaders so people kinda expect pvp
---
Which is fine, I can either make room in my current build for stealth boy perks or just make a sniper build but that doesn't remove the problem with autoaim regardless.
---
Auto aim has never been a good thing in games.
---
But, but, I thought we were supposed to whine that it was *fundamentally broken* like we usually do,
---
Please don't. The new mode is a lot of fun (if you're prepared!) but I honestly feel like I just killed someone's enjoyment of the game and it feels icky. I didn't even catch the username before they quit out.
---
I can't think of anything more terrifying than that event in survival...team up to kill the queen....then cheese it like mad to get the stable flux and other loot to safety in case the comraderie suddenly switches off üòÇ
---
Didnt seem to matter before the server split. Hmmmmmm, interesting the hypocrisy that arises when the shoe is placed on the other foot. Exactly how many, "how to farm other player," videos were made????
---
Seriously do you want some?
---
He...
---
He, "shit" you with a laser?
---
I hope you weren't too traumatized, it sounds terrible.
---
I did that, still got it though
---
Oh these sweet beautiful idiots.
---
I'm not playing now Ill be on soon
---
But why would i **want** it to?
---
I don't have some big fancy pvp build (heck I started a new boy for survival) but when I can guarantee ill hit stuff, even through walls, why would I want it fixed?
---
Don't get me wrong I would love for any bugs to get fixed, but if Im getting this *problem* why wouldn't others get it and use it to their advantage?
---
Thanks.  At least it wasn't a complete waste then... he'll oneday find he has the mod plans... and maybe work out where they came from. :)
---
Nonetheless, they were forced out with one can of water, one packet of food and no weapons. Seeing how awful the world is would logically drive at least _some_ dwellers to the point of killing for provisions. Similar to island madness, it doesn't take long. As the Overseer said, they _weren't_ prepared for most of this. The Scorched, the haywire robots. Seeing a world where people better equipped than you, with better weapons and such, would be enough to make a man snap.
---
And if a few of your neighbors are willing to kill you, then maybe they all are. Maybe everyone is out to get you. It becomes a matter of threat assessment; this person could kill you and would benefit from your death. Maybe it's smart to kill them first, just in case.
---
In real world disaster scenarios, people lose their civility FAST. And being kicked out of Vault 76 into a world such as this is far worse than those scenarios. It would have a similar shock to actually experiencing the Great War, too. The videos and posters promised Reclamation Day to be this great thing where they stroll out and help the survivors rebuild America, reclaim the Wasteland for the US of A. But there's nobody alive up there, nothing to reclaim, nothing to help rebuild. Reclamation Day was accidentally a lie. The dwellers weren't prepared for this, and that shock could be all it takes.
---
It only takes a few people snapping to break apart any semblance of civility in a situation such as that.
---
Right here

No matter how long it takes it wont solve the problem because new players will always be behind stacked duped gear was removed not only that but all the duped gear is counterable stop complaining if you cant handle survival dont do it
---
It was insane!! Hopefully it will slow down a bit after a few weeks when the novelty wears off.  
---
No problem. I usually play every evening. Just let me know. 
---
What's the reasoning for lvl 60+ players being worth less caps than lvl 100/200/300/etc? Everyone has the same hard cap on special points/perk card slots so it's not like a fully built lvl 60/70 character is weaker than other higher lvl players. 
---
That combined with the spawn camping and immunity not working all the time got old really fast.
---
The best thing to do is try to move on. One time, on an old raider character, I was stalking another player as they ran through a forest. Suddenly, they fell of cliff. I ran to them and stimpacked him. It‚Äôs funny to imagine what it would be like to just be stimpacked out of nowhere. 
---
I left him alone after that. It felt like destiny.  
---
It's any death and it scales based on how much your holding. Tested it with a fee friends if you carry alot you drop alot. 
---
Jimmies rustled
---
We should have a H.O.M.E. and a C.A.M.P.
---
&gt; Another proof of how lazy/rushed was the development of this game.
---
There are certain bugs that reveal their crazy lack of QA. Like, when you get too many holotapes in your inventory and can no longer use holotapes on terminals; that's the sort of bug you can't miss if you're actually testing the game. The unusably-long list of miscellaneous items that you can't drop is another.
---
Yeah, the amount of complaining is hilarious.  Reminds me of the dummies who complain about an online game not having mods.
---
I brought it up about a month ago actually, I get your point that there were definitely a lot of people using the workshop mechanics to ‚Äúfarm‚Äù caps from players, but I think this is a separate issue and shouldn‚Äôt be conflated. And honestly if you don‚Äôt want PvP players to ‚Äúfarm‚Äù in Adventure mode then why be a negative voice towards positive changes?
---
In rust you would get spawn killed by a dude who spawned in a couple of mins ahead of you out of fear that you might want to take his rock 
---
which is a good thing cause i was after his rock
---
As I mostly play solo, it can be frustrating to loose all my caps in just a few deaths. Removing this restriction allows players to get back into the game.
---
With a team like the one you encountered I would have left the server to find one that isn‚Äôt dry. 
---
That would be.  Maybe the mod community can make something.  Did an edit. :-)
---
are you trying to say that the 100 super stimpacks i gathered in survival are worthless because someone else in adventure also got some?
---
That's hilarious
---
Yes there are other aimbot programs people use in games? 
---
U just click play now and it then tells u if u want to go in adventure or survival 
---
I also have extra plans and masks and would like to trade. I need both recipes, branch garland, Helvetia garland and the pole lantern.

Why should players who don‚Äôt want to start again be forced too just because you want too? 
---
i'd love a mobile mini camp so i can have my main base but have a smaller spot to take care of repairs or cooking without having to run all the way home. not to mention i'm never going to complete the build a camp challenges if I always have to move my main one. I like the idea of calling it a **T.E.N.T**
---
**T**actical

**E**mergency

**T**erritory
---
I was hoping for people to go more roleplaying vibe but I guess not. It was pvp all out war..
---
Happened to me, spawned in and just as my screen loaded I see the player take aim.  One shot.
---
spawned 10 times, lost 10k caps and 670 stims. why bathesda? 
---
I logged in yesterday and saw that the Fasnact parade was starting up, so I fast travelled there and discovered that a nuke had detonated in Helvetia while I was traveling there. The scorched in town were 68th level, and the honey beasts were glowing. Unfortunately the small critters we needed to harvest for intestines never materialized in town so the parade never started and the event failed. At least I got to harvest a lot of nuked flora!
---
or he had 999 items which seems more likely

I luckily have not encountered exploiters! Spawn killing sucks. I admit I tired it for a bit to understand what they could do to fix it but I have also been on the receiving end. It seems the invulnerability on spawn is FAR too short. I have noticed some other serious design flaws too. Generally I see more promise than anything though so I am staying positive.
---
Surprised not more people are agreeing with this, imagine how much server stability when I only carry one mama dolces key card instead 42 of them. And yes I keep forgetting I already have it and pick it up anyways.
---
I get your point, that to me is a bit of grey area. I think there should be a hard cap around lvl 150 where you don‚Äôt lose more caps but I think Bethesda has actually addressed this through prestige mode among other things. I haven‚Äôt heard any word on changes to the zero cap system and that‚Äôs why I felt the need to bring it up. Appreciate your feedback tho!
---
what do the greek letters stand for.  Great build btw!
---
I killed some random chick at a train station and she turned her mic on and was quite obviously upset yelling at me as  I ran away saying things like "I'm probably the only girl that ever talked to you etc." She probably doesn't know my fiance. After she said that I just giggled to myself and preceded to run. Like if it was me in the situation I would be a little upset too BUT I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES. So.... yeah.
---
spawn kills
---
You farmed players? I've made 10s of thousands just buying and selling stuff 
---
&gt; It weared down quickly,
---
FFS,  *wore* down.
---
Wait. You dont have to make a new character for survival? Hahahahahah what fucking garbage is this?!
---
With all due respect, if Bethesda really was monitoring what the community says, he would not let the pve characters go to the pvp and vice versa. Start with a new character and a person of level 200 kill you at one stroke is not funny and was already warning in the forum for some time.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my preferred method aswell. The second option does seem a bit harsh in retrospect but sometimes you have to start at 100 and wind down to a happy medium. Thanks for your input!
---
I usually just throw stuff in a random container and then rejoin the server and pick the items back up. Not the safest method but I don‚Äôt have any items that I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose. It‚Äôs never failed for me.
---
how can someone that is marked and hunted and is camp killing players that are hunting him not also be the player with the most kills?
---
They made a decision. Move on.
---
No sir! Survival Mode is about finding every possible exploit you can to turn the game to your advantage,  no matter what.  It was misinterpreted by honest PVP players as a way to fairly engage in PVP, but guess what?  It's a Beta.  At least we got that acknowledgement.  There are millions of honest PVP players out there, they will come into this mode expecting a fair shake, but guess what.  Griefers!  As long as game dev's allow the opportunity for the few to harass the many, they will ! Just glad they are in survival now and as soon as Bethesda implements No Camp Damage in Adventure, I'll call it as perfect in the human to human interaction. Enjoy what you begged for.
---
What's all in your camp to make it look like a bos camp? I would love to do something like that
---
Yes, went to change the paint on my shotty and there was no new option, don't know know why but I'm disappointed.
---
i seem to get 1 shotted by a TSE shotgun when i spawn in yet i thought all TSE weapons became shit :)
---
If it isnt, i dont see any point in playing it tbh. People will just farm and boost on pve and then transfer to pvp and wreck. 
---
New account? You mean new character?
---
ahh yeh i got it..cos i just joined a friend i missed that lol
---
Yeah and in situations where people are just broke I get it, it seems to be a fairly widespread phenomenon for now tho and there are ways to address it that are fair for everyone. I just made a post about it if you wanna check it out.
---
got it!
---
yep, this.
---
I don't know about chameleon armor, but I don't think crouching does anything if you've been alive the longest
---
Source: twice after being alive the longest and not killing any players Iguess some kinda beacon got put on me because both times players instafound me and killed me.
---
These three people achieved what 100,000 couldn‚Äôt do 20 times each with some chances to get two mask drops per an event. Smh
---
Why because you didn‚Äôt prepare for pvp? You knew for months didnt prepare thats your fault
---
It‚Äôs on the way to Quincy 
---
&gt; It's the choice I've made to be stealth. I have sacrificed other beneficial elements in this endeavor.
---
You do realize that every build requires some sacrifices, right?
---
Also, that doesn‚Äôt change that if sneak kept you off the map, it would not be possible to knock you off the leaderboard.
---
i'm enjoying the buff, but I have literally never found a mod for one and no matter how many I scrap I never learn it....do they even exist? 
---
(drops into sneak, moves away as fast as possible).
---
Then don‚Äôt play on survival. 
---
I played for an hour or so, but I was smart and put all my meds away except a very limited number just in case so when I died I didn‚Äôt lose much. 
---
The PvP patch notes were clear. You‚Äôre going to lose double the caps and a random assortment of med items. 
---
You‚Äôre just complaining to complain. 
---
From the patch notes, I don't get how this isn't clear:
---
 ‚ÄúSlap‚Äù Damage Has Been Removed from Adventure Mode
---
* All  incoming damage from players you are not hostile with (A.K.A. ‚Äúslap‚Äù  damage) will now be automatically reduced to zero, effectively removing  slap damage from Adventure Mode. 
---
   * Returning fire against another player will still mark you as  hostile toward them and will cause you to take full damage from their  attacks.
---
   * Contesting an owned Workshop is still considered a  hostile action. If a player attempts to contest a Workshop you own, or  you attempt to contest another player‚Äôs Workshop, you will be open to  taking full damage from their attacks.
---
None of the new brews are affected by the perks.
---
Those machine noises were really a pain in the neck. Sexy and quiet, eh? I'll give it a try, thanks:)
---
So when you gonna get on?
