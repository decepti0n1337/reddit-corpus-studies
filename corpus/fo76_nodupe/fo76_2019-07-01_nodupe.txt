Yeah, i was looking over the challenges. They replaced the atom rewards with.. a board game of rewards??? I havent looked over them yet.
---

---
This is disappointing.
---
---
---
Your maths is correct, however you have added an extra level in as we start at level 1 so there are only 99 progressions. 
---
So the total would be 223,750.
---
The maths is here: https://mathforyou.net/en/online/calculus/series/sum/?e0=MQAwADAAMAArADIANQAqAHgA0&amp;e1=MAA1&amp;e2=OQA5AA2&amp;v0=x&amp;s=108&amp;i=0&amp;h=855D5DD46BA8E815DADB57E5EE477C7D
---
10k XP per week is pretty low.
---
Bear in mind, in addition to normal XP boosts (sleeping/canned meat), the addition of public teams boosts the XP a lot.
---
A public team (building) that is bonded (takes about 2 mins) gives +4 INT which affects your XP gain.
---
Alternatively, if maxed on INT, the events team will give double XP for completing events, or the hunters will give double XP for legendary kills.
---
Because of being able to run a public team, you can use the inspiring perk card for +15% XP
---
You can also use the herd mentality mutation for +2 INT increasing your XP gain.
---
Given most players have a mutation of some sort, you can also use the strange in numbers perk to increase your INT further.
---
Lastly, some of the rewards are those lunch boxes that give +25% xp (1hr). Description says to friends nearby. Tested with someone on team stood next to them - we both got the bonus. Dont know if being on a team is required, or if theres a radius. So if you're playing with someone you actually know, you can stagger out who activates one so you both get the benefit.
---
Played this evening for ~ 2.5hrs (15 INT, herd mentality, 1x lunch box) and hit 10k xp three times (300 score).
---
Thats assuming there isnt a double xp weekend at some point in the next 10 weeks.
---
I am so disappointed.
---
It just works
---
I did some research, apparently the NW items are from past events that you aren’t supposed to be able to get. The jumpsuit drop is a very rare drop from Uranium Fever I think.
---
Yeah we noticed since the patch was live. Another patch, another bug i suppose. I hope they fix this fast and not in a month or more.
---
There must be something I’m missing. They have to cap the score interest at some point and it won’t keep adding right?
---
Umm...
---
As per the title, you can't zoom ALL the way out to see the WHOLE board.
---
You know, so you don't have to use your mouse to move the board around.
---
Um...no.
---
The thing that shows the devs don't play the game is the fact that the gameplay and events are designed like shit.
---
The devs think everyone has crappy weapons and no ammo, so they create events where like 10 enemies spawn and you have to beat 5 waves.
---
When in reality every fucker in this game has some bullshit overpowered build/legendary that will one shot anything in the game so every event is just some guy waiting on the spawn point for those enemies, one shotting all of them instantly, and then waiting afk for a minute for the next wave to respawn.
---
If the game was designed with them in mind, if the devs actually knew how fucking powerful most players were - we'd have events with 100+ enemies at this point that are actually fun and challenging.
---
#Legendaries. Ruined. This. Game.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
There's been a datamined t65-maybe skin that's got a BoS emblem on. Search datamined here, recent
---
You get over 2000 for doing the super quick faction dailies. Then do a couple events, the easy dailies, and do your legendary/loot/xp/ runs like normal. Seems pretty easy to get to 10k
---
If you’re quick enough to press escape when the level reward pops up, you can still get to the board game to claim your rewards. I’ve only been able to do that once today, but that’s also after only playing for an hour or two.
---
Thanks, thats good to know. Seems my piggy banks will need to do some work on the days I'm in a pinch with time.
---
Do you also throw sucker punches,beside calling your bros to a 1v1?
---
I’ll give that a try next time
---
its gaudy af in my humble opinion
---
Should have just let us chuck a huge heap of 1 ammo type into the converter, set it to what we want out of it and than we could come back later to see how much has been made.
---
Well, now you have something to spend them on. It’s not until later on in the season that you can buy the levels, though.
---
It's not designed for people that have been hoarding ammo for two years. It's meant as a way to get rid of the handful of crap you pick up while out and about. I mean it's the 5th (of 100) prize on the first ever free season. It's not an endgame, meta machine. 
---
It would absolutely be nice if it would do more and do it faster but as it stands it's about on par with making ammo or cooking or any other bench. Well minus the two extra button pushes.
---
I go one step further: it's not that they dont play it - they clearly dont even *like* it.
---
I think it’s because it’s a “space race” themed season that they went for a more futuristic / out landish kinda vibe with the HUD. Doesn’t quite sit well with the rest of the UI and HUD tho I agree.
---
The daily cap is never an even amount for any bullets. You want to turn in 100 .38 rounds? Sorry, your daily limit caps out at 97
---
Exactly what's happening lol
---
Isn’t it supposed to be from a kids comic book?
---
This sadly makes no sense to me
---
Uranium fever is where I got them, but I’m guessing they all don’t drop at once though
---
Doubt it’s intentional. After every patch we get more bugs. It’s Bethesda’s reverse psychology. That’s their way of fixing their games. “It just works”.
---
They should just implement a popular UI mod that's already out and pay/credit the mod author. They would probably just have to tweak it and bugfix. It would save them lots of time and make fans happy
---
And this Season is based around Captain Cosmos, which was a children’s show. So, it fits.

I might get one level during 3-4 hours of normal play, but I’m also lvl 500+.  If I log in with a low xp bar, I might not gain a level that day.
---
Oh okay. That might be it. I’ll try. Thanks a lot
---
After over 1000 hours in the game, I still don't have the 10 atom challenge done for finishing an event in a team. Is this about to change? Am I willing to throw away this achievement for a mere 1000 score points?
---
Getting thru 20k+ of .44 at 15 rounds a transaction will take years irl
---
&gt;  I truly believe this deserves more attention then it’s actually receiving
---
youll have to fight your way past the outrage
---
My bad then. I’ll go back and search. Thanks
---
"Percussive Information Technology Technician"
---
90% of the rewards are pretty bad, even the best sellers (ammo converter for example) is trash.  
---
You get 150 atoms for each 10 levels, so 1500 atoms in 3 months, instead of 7000 atoms in the same time span.
---
Sorry, but I don't think there's enough ammo converter posts. This is just taking up valuable space for ammo converter posts.
---
That's the sad part about it. The design, the art, all of it is good. The idea behind it has potential. But in the usual f76 fashion, something behind the scenes craps it all up and you can smell it very clearly
---
Are you not getting the points or did you get them early?  
---
I first noticed it with my camp upgrades and then hunting robots, that I received the points after completing 3 of the targets rather than 5.  
---
Getting them to 5 didn't award me any additional points, so it seems like the target value might be incorrect.
---
No, they do, it’s just very rare.
---
Do the Level up challenges with a lower level/new character.
---
And if you put 2 or more, you an use only one until its animation is finished, so no placing 10 and getting all the water in short time
---
Ha! Maybe if we had 65 inch screens
---
Oh lucky me then
---
My "W" key is starting to go out. Might as well add my SPACE bar to the mix based on how the ammo converter currently works lol...
---
Even still, the time it takes you is crazy... Would be ok if there was a max out option for each choice so we can get back to, you know, playing the game?
---
I guess I shouldn't complain too much, it's an ok addition, just could be so much better.
---
It’s been pretty widely discussed now, you’re getting the points when you get to 3/5 of the challenge requirements for some reason. Then when it’s complete it looks like you didn’t get them. It’s confusing but at least for me, I did the math, didn’t miss anything.
---
Help! Me too. I’m so sad. I was stoked.

If it works properly then yay! But only time will tell as it was always a little inconsistent. Meanwhile on one of my standard jumps from A-B it still took multiple attempts so it's not perfect yet.

It's probably faster to go to the forest and punch level 1 scorched to death to farm ammo rather than turn in what you have

It will count when you load into adventure mode?

Hey, thank you.

i actually paid for that monthly 1st thingy, just to get on a private server because i was constantly getting killed by others.

So i have no clue how that works with my server being laggy.

While you're here, could i ask if the events are soloable? or am i better off on a normal server?

i captured 2 and it was free travel

I love the fact that it's repeatable and not that hard to get. I've already done it about 10 times. Every little bit helps

Press and hold B or your respective close option on your choice of console to close out of it no matter what screen your on.

For the love of Chuck-ee Cheese!! I was pretty pissed about the tap too. Kinda fucking useless. I have a lake at the back of my house for collecting dirty water why would I want a sink that just takes up CAMP Budget for the same thing.

T65 works with Reskins though right? I know paints are restricted to the armor, but we could get a BOS Skin that would apply and that would make sense.

Burned through over 200 ECM ammo in two events and decided to call it quits.

the helmets are a redo, as is everything else that wasn’t the flyboy stuff. No new camp items at all, especially the much desired red rocket.
---
And the flyboy stuff is pretty ugly
---
Why the hell couldn’t they just have featured a “breakdown ammo” mechanic, similar to fallout NV.
---
This smells of a SCRUM master forcing delivery of a minimum viable product... the feature is there but the UI/UX is for the next Sprint/Epic to worry about.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
edit: except the UI improvement never leaves backlog....
---
Lucky. At least for me on console (but again mighta been a bug cause not seen many others talk about the backing out part) I had to go back through every single page I’d opened individually. Took me like two whole minutes just to close the damn terminal.
---
With XP bonuses from multiple sources, even at 300+ you can level up in about an hour or two, if you go to certain spots. 
---
One level up per day isn’t that difficult if you choose to focus accordingly. 
---
At least now you don’t have to worry about changing outfits or making sure you’re well fed, on chems, etc.
---
And now put on the power armour and your main bonus is that you won't sit on every chair by accident, no bonus 15 int that gives you +30% experience just from unyielding armour
---
So? It's a season not a "day". It's meant to keep people playing everyday for 100 days. I'm really glad xp is worth less than half a normal challenge.
---
Unyielding players already have a 30% xp buff over all other builds all the the time.
---
I was able to turn off team notices using settings &gt; display. I'm not sure if it affects everything you're seeing but it turned off the messages about people making groups.

cool, thanks!

oh snap.. were gonna get fucked on double xp weekends...
---
no way they are gonna keep dropping those as frequently as they have in the past..

shit...

We shouldn't need to create a new character every day though just for a challenge....
---
It’s actually 31780265

Its not a bug its a feature

This was always just a reworking of the challenge system, there was a lot more made of it than there should’ve been—mostly by players.
---
It does seem so, this is really strange.
---
Just to let you know the skin is bugged. I got it on Xbox and none of the parts on the gun will change for the skin. So I have a drum mag on but it won’t show it but the animation still acts as though it’s the drum mag if that makes sense. Pretty much your hands look terrible reloading.
---
Not a lot of flat areas with water, and when you find one it usually looks like a dump.
---
I used to be on the golf course too but you get constantly attacked, it gets annoying.
---
There's a cute little lake in between Gilman Lumber Mill and Isolated Cabin you might check...it is flat-ish on one side. I was there until a couple of days ago, now moved on a hill in forest, no water (can still run basic purifiers anyway), but a great view from my balcony... 🤷🏻‍♂️

---
Sounds like a good youtube video. Now you just gotta clickbait it and put arrows all over the thumbnail for all the views
---
haha. They put a flash hider on the flash hider. It's like a meme or something.
---
They’re bugged, like the rest of the game is. They have UI people but they’re glitched and not working.
---
What's wrong with teams?
---
Are you on PS4 if so I’ll buy some fusion and plasma cores from you
---
I mean like let’s say I converted ammo 4 times (with three new screens every time), when I was backing out I didn’t just have to close 3 screens, I had to close 3 for every 4 times I converted ammo. So I had to close like (4x3) 16 screens. But that’s just for this example I actually scrapped enough to get me 2000 Ammo Points, it was like 80 screens just to back out and close the terminal when I’d finished.
---
You’re telling me that’s an intended feature?
---
Nothing on that front, that’s probably one of the best updates they’ve done in the past months.
---
It's a great means to tactically gain free fast travel too!

Why do you lock your generator room, out of curiosity?

Explosive energy guns aren't "hacked" you just cant get them anymore

Well I haven't seen my current dad for the past 25+ years. He went to go buy milk late one night and never came back.

Yeah just rebuilt it recently
---
Yea I quite like it, I'm not really a group player but I joined one for the xp boost and noticed LOADS more people participating in the events
---
I have a theory they had the initial A Team build the world but then brought in a C Team to finish the game while A worked on Elder Scrolls or Star Field.
---
High ranked players are selling plasma cores now for 15 caps a piece. Baffles me when I see lvl 50s selling theirs for 150 a pop.
---
[removed]
---
I may pace em out. Depends on how much I’m gonna play this summer
---
I’m not talking about the legacy ?E? rolls. Those are powerful but totally ok. I’m talking about the hacked guns that absolutely break PVP and shouldn’t be allowed to exist
---
I'd wager one of the hardest balances in game design is trying to accommodate casual play and dedicated players. Especially when they are fundamentally opposites. People ask for more to do, more to grind, and at the same time other people are asking for more streamlined.  
---
Edit: I'd accept this season since it is Free, but I certainly feel like if you pay for a season pass then you are entitled to its contents even if you don't finish the progression. If you are paying for it then the Progression should only exist as a way to get the content early. End of the season, all of what you paid for is given to you, but I can also see how others may see that as a way to unincentivies playtime.
---
It doesn’t take that long if you just click to get the points and then click back immediately instead of going through the whole menu again, I went through thousands of rounds fairly quickly actually
---
Oh no i noticed the problem aswell and was just joking i understand your point
---
Boost up your INT. Berry Mentats, Unyielding Armor, use XP boosting foods. I get around 290 per level 68 super mutant. Scorchbeasts at fissure sites are even better. Honestly, I hit that repeatable at least 3 times in just a couple hours after the update. Add in events, dailies, etc and it’s really not as bad as it sounds.
---

Yes! I love just how much you can scroll around the board too! There's a lot of lovely little details and the pop-ups in-game are so crisp.
---
Annnnnd im done playing.
---
add another 0 to that and you have my problem, i been hording every bullet i have gotten on an alt to sell one day until this came along. i have 40k of each of the ammo i actually use save for the 50 cal ultracite, thats hard to find for sale lol
---
Oh. Well hopefully Bethesda was just joking too and they’re changing that shit rn
---
when i found the ammo press in the armory in the north (forgot its name) i thought it would be like the fallout 3 ammo press where you put in scrap metal or other ammo, choose the ammo you want, and bam you get huge amounts of that ammo. is the ammo converter like this i havent played in a while
---
Have you used the ammo converter?
---
Apparently it was a glitch and you need the special fallout edition to “own” it, lost mine too, fucking asshole Bethesda
---
"Or other hacked weapons"  makes it seem like you're lumping in explosive gatling plasmas as hacked.  Removing the spawned weapons is harder than it seems which is why they are still in wide cirulation.  If being killed in a PVP zone though to even legitmate weapons bothers you  maybe you should avoid them.
---
Im going to have to change my camp build around this mind set now. I have been killed once at a trap camp, i laughed, went back and bought what I wanted. 
---
I always have my shops inside with the decoration and benches available. Just seemed more like how i would want them. I also keep the purifiers and junk collectors unlocked. Someone else wants to scrounge through and find a few screws or nuclear waste they really need, I think they are welcome to take it. Water and food always available at my camp.
---
Go away.
---
Plays a little song too which the gif doesn't capture. I think it is a Top Gun reference maybe?
---
Very much a Fanboy vs Hater topic. I like the concept but the massive drop in potential atoms outweighs the items you can earn by a good margin, especially if you aren't heavily in to armour/weapon skins. Wish they had also done something like +20 atoms per level to take away some of the pain. Might have satiated some of the blood lust.
---
No surprise they screwed the pooch again. It was obvious that they want players to buy more atoms with gutting the daily/weeklies. But this is another layer.
---
Sounds like a great way to get low levels to do a quest for you. “Convert this ammo into this ammo and I’ll reward you with x”
---
You're a Hoarder,  it's ok. There are others like you... I'm like you... we love you

You wait and claim them later

Only 999 other things left to go.

And 3 seperate pickaxe skin packs!
---
I take it you have the Carnivore mutation?
---
&gt; The burrows being a supposed tough challenge for a team of 50+ players?
---
Are you kidding me? Really?  If they thought that, the devs play this game with their eyes closed.
---
BTW that Harpoon Gun is probably better than a 3 star lead pipe. &lt;rolls eyes&gt;
---
But, you specifically mentioned explosive energy weapons. Those used to be legitimate drops.
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Because we need more inventory management
---
Explosive "?E?" Rolls (?) are still going to ruin your day in pvp.  You are still fine with them being in the game though so I'm just preaching to the choir here.
---
Fair point. The most recent one happened to be a Gatling plasma. I have nothing against that weapon/roll when it’s legit and not doing 80,000,000 base dmg. Fair PVP is a blast! I recognize being killed because I was outplayed - that’s why PVP is fun
---
The American salute was only supposed to be available to people that bought the tricentennial edition of the game, and a bug a while ago allowed everyone to have it. So you not having it isn’t a glitch; it’s a patch to fix a glitch.
---
Did something recently change with the Carnivore mutation?
---
The problem is he included the word "other" which makes it seem like he is correlating the two.  If he removes that he will get what he may have meant to say.
---
I agree, the moment they can do better themselfs then they can complain.
---
I’ve got bandolier 2 and batteries included 3, and it lets me carry 20k .308, 20k .50 cal, 20k 10mm, 20k 5.56, 20k fusion cells, 20k 2mm ec, and currently sitting at 42 fusion cores. That on top of the multiple weighted weapons clothing and aid I carry I still can hold 11 pounds worth of junk. Shits CRAZY
---
Just downloading patch now.. Says 3 hours.
---
Yep, got em from scorched mobs during sbq, I’ve heard they were buggy before the patch so maybe this is their way of trying to get people to use em and maybe get the plans. Haven’t tried them post patch though maybe they work now. All I know is when you drop em it destroys em. Not sure why
---
Who doesn't have bubble gum? Lol.. I guess most people sell or drop it.
---
Given its low weight I always stash it.
---
Sometimes sneak breaks and I have to re-equip it. Have you tried that? I’ll be keeping a closer eye on my adrenaline effect now.
---
Ammo converter? I have never heard anyone speak about this, and especially not in the last few hours in 1000 posts covering the topic.
---
priorities are fucked yo
---
I’m getting a very different bug where in adventure it will just award me with anywhere between 100-1000 score so I’m already at rank 11
---
With how this game has always been, whatever you’re complaining about is more vague than Valve’s definition of the word “soon.”
---
It doesn't give hp,but i'm wondering if it gives extra sprinting efficiency from END.
---
Anyway a direct upgrade of the enclave undie,so must have for many builds.
---
It's really laggey for me and I'm on a one x
---
Same here. Three of my weeklies awarded the score points after only completing 3/5 requirements.
---
Is that the one you buy from crater, or something different? Idk why but I feel lost
---
That's weird. You might wanna check the math, just to be sure, but otherwise I'd fire off a ticket so they can look into it.
---
at least they are consistent..
---
As someone who has not played yet since the update, that's so disappointing. I thought it was going to be like an armor table or weapon table. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
---
Yes, I do have Carnivore. Is there something new that I missed from the release notes?
---
Looks like double effect now affects everything. Try eating vegetables &amp; see if it gives you zero buffs. That's what people have been reporting
---
My strength is only +3 so I’m afraid I cannot do it solo.
---
It was reported earlier today, and Bethesda replied. Hopefully it is able to be hotfixed, and not wait for the next patch.
---
Sounds like you and u/Lonley-PopTart are a good match.
---
They certainly make PVP challenging, but that’s part of the game. I have an AAE Harpoon that’s my favorite gun. Legacies add value and reward people for keeping up the grind. What is NOT ok is being able to give a .50 cal energy damage and then make copies for your friends or profit
---
Pretty sure it was deigned for new players. Pretty sure they purposely made it tedious to keep end game players from just having all the ammo in the world. Artificial gating type stuff. I haven't used it yet but honestly I don't really pick up ammo I don't need.
---
the only suggestion I have is I found a shortcut that at least speeds it up.
---
say you want to sell a bunch of 1 type of ammo.  go through the process of selling 1 batch, wait for the next screen, then go "back" (on pc it's the tab button) and you can repeat without going through the entire menu again.
---
Saves multiple steps depending on how much/different types of ammo you have on you.
---
It's an unreported change
---
Teach me exactly how easy it is, because it's taken me two full hours to go up from 84 to 85, and that's killing everything I come across and eight events.
---
Watoga you’ll find 10 in half an hour
---
Oh man... hope I didn’t lose my asylum outfit
---
If you want to do the teams challenges solo, start up a private server and create a public team. It should count. If you don't have 1st you can always just join a random public team and leave once you finish the team-specific challenges
---
Mine did too. Gotta wait another 36 hours
---
Yeah, I have 140 fusion cores, 140+ Ultracite fusion cores and 70 plasma cores.  
---
It's been weeks since I took Poseidon power plant or crafted any Ultracite cores.  I still can't burn them fast enough.  There's just...nothing to use them on.  
---
I'll be damned if I drop them on the ground, though.
---
Then avoid playing it first! 
---
Do you still put your hand on the stove to see if it's hot?
---
Are you talking about my biological father, or one of the step dad's I've had along the way. Please clarify so I can judge how many shrug emojis to use.
---
Don't forget PVP has damage caps so base damage is not as much a factor.  If you really enjoy PVP you should probably mess around in Nuclear Winter right now.  Since a new patch came out most of hacks are outdated currently so it will be more likely to get a fair experience.
---
Wow just wow!!
---
Sounds like Bethesda
---
You said " I don't get all the hate". So don't tell me you understand when you said you don't. 
---
It's like 4 clicks to sell and 4 more to buy. I call BS on you being able to get 1000s quickly. That's the problem with it. I have 10 of thousands of rounds to convert and it would take hours and 100s of thousands of clicks. That's not cool. 
---
Also ammo is already worthless. Fixing this ammo converter isn't going to change anything for the economy. Only ammo worth anything is ultracite and you can't convert that.
---
The Daily Events one got stuck on 4 for quite a while then finally ticked over to 5, but I've just completed the Robots one and got nothing awarded for it.
---
So I'm missing 2k already because two of my weeklies completed due to a bug they were supposed to have fixed with this patch. This is really disheartening to hear. https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
Nice! I know it gives 2x benefits of eating meat, so it makes sense. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Looks good but If you're not having inventory weight issues I'd put 2 pts of Bandolier instead Sturdy Frame unless you carry more armor than guns and ammo. But for me I'd get very bored of using just one gun haha. 
---
I'd also take 3 point out of INT since they look like they're unused atm and put them in PER for Concentrated Fire since it's good for shooting more healthier enemies from a distance because stealth. Unless you just like to aim down sights for everything which defeats the purpose for Bloodied Unyielding Rifle  builds (because they have so much AP!)
---
Also maybe replace Action Boy/Girl for Mister Sandman since it's more damage if it's night. Just make sure to equip Mister Sandman BEFORE Covert Operative to get the full 3.75 sneak crit damage.
---
Edit: forgot to say, put on Escape Artist since you're missing one point in AGI if you do go for Mister Sandman
---
But if it worked where you put in an amount of one and got out an amount of another in one go it would work for both endgame players who are sitting on thousands of unused ammo and those who got a hundred or so from exploring the world.
---
I came here to say this very thing. Why is it not like a crafting bench? Yuck.
---
I’m really hoping I’m wrong or that it gets tweaked
---
Hilarious but soooo true! Lol! I laugh at these people. Ran into a player that had a trap camp that was complaining noone was buying anything from his machines....Gotta just laugh at impressively low IQ of some people....Lol
---
I’m getting reeeaaaaallllll sick of it
---
Same. Building up the Workshop and killing robots awarded early.
---
But just imagine if they had decided to make it good by just using the UI of the legendary scrip machine (or any other vendor).  Drag your stuff over- how many?  OK!  Drag what you want back- how many?  Done!  That would have served everyone equally, no matter how much you want to trade in, be it a little or a lot.  And it would have been easy to do.
---
Great, my one week vacation starting today is going to sting when I return.
---
It happened to me with the same two challenges.
---
That's the standard stuff, seems pretty set. If you wanna do extra you better clear Westtek a thousand times tho,they don't want you getting ahead at all
---
This is awful. I just got home from work. While waiting to download the excruciatingly long update I  jump on here to find the first 6 posts stating the only thing I really wanted is trash. Looks like I’ll just wait till tomorrow to play.
---
You know what would have been really straight forward? Using the existing Armco machine for this - dump all of your ammo in it, then select what flavour you want it to convert to and Bingo Bango Bongo it just slowly converts it all while you're off grinding for bullion... How easy would that have been!
---
Levelling up at lvl 630 takes me almost a week playing between 1 and 2 hours daily with a non unyielding build.
---
So yeah i'm not mad if a have to make a new character.
---
Could you be more specific? What’s the problem that made you want to post?
---
&gt; we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result
---
Quick question, can you make Ultracite ammo with the converter?
---
I got an idea better than Bethesda's ammo crapper!  Make an attachment to the tinkers workbench that will craft 5.56, with ammo Smith on, at a rate of 36 rounds at a cost of 38 rounds of .38.  72 rounds at a cost of 80 rounds of .38.  144 rounds of 5.56 at a cost of 180 rounds of .38.
---
I was really looking forward to getting this till I got it was vastly disappointed. 
---
All devs had to do was give us something to breakdown unwanted ammo but instead thought it would be good to leave us with that contraption
---
Quite the opposite actually team C made the game and borked it so team A had to come in and fix it
---
resources, once you claim it
---
Season is 12 weeks long, but yeah, its a tight fit.
---
Like the ammo collection bit?
---
It looks like the limited time rewards are available even though they shouldn't be, if you go to this page:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
Under Limited Time Rewards you'll see that wreath is the first limited time reward from the Christmas event
---
Same. I don’t see workshops owned by myself or anyone else and I can’t fast travel to a workshop I own.
---
Sounds like a great bonus.
---
this means we can keep the rewards, once they're unlocked?
---
Both?
---
So if you start playing after a month you are screwd.  
---
Also if you decide to not log in a few days on the entire summer (because you are on vacation or something) you are also screwd and you wont be able to reach 100.  
---
This is intentional so you will spend atoms if you want to finish  the board or miss on the late rewards.
---
They did this to ensure people have to buy tiers with real cash if they want everything. Greed disguised as "free stuff"
---
food yo
---
You can
---
I was looking forward to it, but for $5 i can buy a spoon so that they can eat my ass.
---
Season pass?
---
This is both good and bad. On the upside you won't be able to get ganged up on by a team of players if you are solo. However, it means that if there is a level 300 player with an explosive Gatling plasma and a full set of assassins sentinel armor you won't be able to call your friends to help.
---
Does the leveling curve getting higher and higher with each level or does it stop somewhere?
---
You thought they would just GIVE you an easy way to convert your ammo. Pretty naive if you ask me.
---
It would also bear the vendor market for people selling ammo.
---
Actually my bad, lower bound was 0 so needed an upper bound of 98 not 99. So the total would be 220,275. 
---
https://mathforyou.net/en/online/calculus/series/sum/?e0=MQAwADAAMAArADIANQAqAHgA0&amp;e1=MAA1&amp;e2=OQA4AA2&amp;v0=x&amp;s=108&amp;i=0&amp;h=D91098
---
Assuming the daily/weekly totals stick at 2000/7500 that would indeed be 215,000 over 10 weeks. So there's a ~5000 SCORE shortfall if the +25 per level is maintained.
---
On the face of it, it seems undoable with solely Dailys and Weeklies (especially considering one of the dailies was NW only). SCORE is available from public events apparently, although I didn't notice how much, and you also have the 10,000 xp SCORE to add as well. So it will be doable.
---
There are some interesting parts of the board game too.. maybe the +25 resets when the tile colours change or something. Only time will tell I suppose. (Unless someone datamines it).
---
You mean like a regular party? That would defeat the purpose.
---
to be fair.. it is almost july..
---
rudolph and frosty are down with the christmas in july...
---
Sounds like I'm not even going to worry about climbing the ladder as I don't have the ability to play every day. Cyberpunk is looking so good right now.
---
I’m missing today’s and tomorrow’s dailies... welp my thoughts of hitting top rank just drove off a cliff. Bethesda really screwed the pooch
---
There is a thing called VATS that is pretty nifty to not worry about recoil.
---
I had it pop up after two conditions were met when it looked like five need to be completed.
---
I wonder if this UI monstrosity functions this way so as to be dupe proof?  That’s the only explanation I can come up with.
---
Happened to me too. I could be wrong but I think a level in adventure = a pack in NW
---
That's not a theory, that's just the way the industry works. Maintenance teams are tiny compared to in development teams.
---
It’s the rank of the perk being shared.  When you’re in a group you can share a perk that equals 1 ranks for every 3 points of CHA you have.
---
leader of the pack?
---
The constant broken updates over the last few months, just confusing to me how the game always seems to have a huge broken element to it. 
---
They’ve removed the best way to get atoms for example and replaced with the season score which is a shame. But then you’re getting bugged out dailies where people aren’t getting any score despite finishing a challenge. 
---
If I think back the animal spawns that set back Faschnact was another broken update that then had to be pushed back. I’m just confused on how they get things wrong so often or let things get so bad until all the community end up ranting about it.
---
Shared Perks. Players can share certain perks with a team so they all benefit
---
19k 5mm? 118k 5mm here, get on my level.
---
Workshop one didn't count for me as well.
---
whitespring can have up to 5 sometimes for me. Go to the golfcourse building and theres normally 2-3 in there and then along the rows of houses I can sometimes find 1-2 more
---
Unless they change it, no, I have 180 On my NW character and he does not have that many
---
Turn on pacifist mode so it doesn't happen.
---
Look out for Horde Events. Unsure if leader of the pack would also be great to farm as that’ll spawn 3 wolves that drop 1* items but I don’t know if those counts as legendaries. If not you have about a week to do that
---
It honestly baffles me why this isn’t the case. It works like this in every other trading scenario in the game
---
It cost cash not atoms. You would remember.
---
But getting the chicken coop is still possible right?
---
Is the reload animation still broken, ie does your character's hand still clip into the magwell? I'd bet money it is but I want to know for sure.
---
They need to just give this game to zenimax online. Eso isat least popular, its got its own problems but at least they are pushing content that makes some sense
---
Pretty much sums up Fallout 76...
---
Yeah it was painfully long to scrap 3500 fusion cells
---
It’s an AR they slapped a giant knob on so that they can reuse the handmade’s animation.
---
That being said, it looks like a Portuguese pattern AR-10.
---
It should be able to work with a slider and still be dupe-proof if the devs actually fixed the damn game
---
No idea how that works, have never grouped up before tonight.
---
You have to get to rank 5.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons
---
Yup nets you 3 easy bois
---
And Uranium Fever
---
I’m a solo player too but it was so nice to finally get the Complete Events While on a Team challenge done for the first time in like forever.
---
Praise him!
---
LoL those noobs at that farm in the early wayward quest line, I was disappointed that I couldn't school them
---
might as well play some Nuclear Winter to get some of the stuff I missed out on
---
This is BGS we’re talking about.
---
How terrible is the conversion rates you lose 18 .38 rounds for what like 20 points they for what 150 points you cab get like 12 .45 rounds or whatever I know my numbers aren't exactly right but they are close how does this make people want to use this
---
Don’t worry, those Vertibird PA skins that were datamined have BOS logos on the them. Bet they are coming soon too.
---
One of my first mods in Fallout New Vegas was to make 100x recipes for all the ammo crafting and breakdown. Wish I could do that here.
---
Ooof, i have the the little wooden ice box that holds 15.  I was considering getting the RR one hoping it would hold more considering its size.  Looks awesome though
---
Glad it's working for you I'm paying 13 caps a time travel to mine right now, which sucks as I only started 2 days ago so trying to save caps.
---
There's always heading back to modded 4 or NV. NV's even had some great mod advancements lately with the soft plugin limit at 130 finally being broken, and NVSE is being freshly updated again!
---
If only...
---
Thanks guyYeah tried reloading everything and nothing.  My crossbow is garbage now.  If I switch weaponj to handmade, kill, then switch back the damge increase is immediate.  Crossbows (for sure) are busted with Adrenaline.
---
So this game will never be more than a tired, mindless grind with a garbage payout or i should say no payout. Can't be done with 100% completion of challenges on top of that some of these challenges will still remain broken or auto complete taking away score. 
---
The chances of someone completing 100% of the challenges over 10 weeks is already insanely difficult and time consuming and that is still not enough??
---
If that's true than glowing meat+ hound meat+sheepsquatch meat+yao guay meat =80% extra melee damage now? 
---
The queen is about to have a reeallly hard time ahead.
---
Opinions!
---
I'm checking this out for sure.  Wasn't playing the game back then, lol.
---
How much Dadpoints would I need to spend?
---
People seems to be correct. :-)
---
With Carnivore meat buffs are doubled, e.g., Scorchbeast meat now has a +6 buff, Ribeye +40 to carry weight
---
With Carnivore corn soup buffs is 0.
---
This is legit going backwards from Fo3's Ammo Press and Nv's crafting system. Tedious as fuck.
---
[It just works!](https://youtu.be/YPN0qhSyWy8)
---
Don’t worry. The next season will be the same rewards, just reordered!
---
Well, to be fair, it has only been 26 years since the bombs fell. And if I remember right, West Virginia didn't even take a direct hit. It very well could have been pulled out of a factory's storage building, right out of the crate.
---
Beat me to the mark but yes I’d rather not waste my free time after work exchanging ammo at a sluggish pace. Hopefully they rework the scrap amount soon.
---
As i started to open the packs and get xp from the duplicates, i started unlocking Halloween and Christmas event rewards. So im 99% sure im just bugged.
---
Seriously this game is built with the bones of Fallout New Vegas but that game had a more user friendly ammo conversion and crafting system.
---
"did they change the weight of something?"
---
...only my expectations.
---
Very true
---
I have done a bit now. 
---
Started with about 3000 fusion cells. 30 of them gets me 60 points. So 6000 points for all of that. 
---
The only ammo I want that I can craft with this is 2mmec. You need 300 for 15 new ammos. For my 3000 cells I got about... 300 2mm. So about a 10% of those cells is used
---
Well 2mm is more valuable that's still a lost of about 90%. 
---
That's 2600 cells that will not not get fired.  For a base no bonus teams rifle it will hit for 78 dmg. About 234k dmg that you could use if you don't switch.
---
A blank gauss rifle hits for 140. For the ammo you get. You can now do 42k total.
---
And well you don't use all that at once and armor will play into how effective that dmg is on what it hits; that still a big lose of useable power someone had before they converted.
---
For me: I used heavy guns and shotguns. I never can or will used cells,10mm, .45, or .38. Meaning for me that's not a lose at all. Ammo can only ever be sold but let me tell you. I've been trying to sell that shit for a month and no one was buying it even for one cap an ammo. So it either needed to go on the floor or become something useful.
---
The issue more over is how long it takes to get the ammo swapped. And that should be changed. Cause a terminal takes ages of me slapping enter more then what I see a lusty deathclaw maid.
---
don't complain they will kick you 5 times in a roll and shut you out
---
Not a visual bug, they're unlocked. The ghillie suit and items are also available again.
---
Just to add I edited my maths and found the total to be 220,275.
---
Assuming the +25 is consistent throughout.
---
Also, SCORE is awarded for public events, but I'm not sure how much.
---
Nope, we get the one that shocks us.
---
I have not been getting a legendary mob for the boss of the wolf horde that procs when you complete leader of the pack..
---
also.. leader of the pack always has 3 legendary mobs
---
I got 250 from Free Range but I might have just done a daily
---
I linked to the post but then realized it had a Spoiler tag, so I deleted it. Sorry about that...
---
The password is always “SWORDFISH.”
---
Damn that partially solved the problem but I’m still about 40 over what I usually am
---
Well crap, I was planning to grind nuclear winter all night since the Christmas rewards are glitched i didnt earn them previously. Figured I could knock out that xp challenge 5+ times
---
Actually the ammo converter is from Fallout 3 The Pitt
---
I had no issues on Xbox. I only have the kill 3 more legandary and I will be done with daily and weekly.
---
The Christmas/Halloween rewards is definitely a bug and has been addressed by a community manager earlier. They just said enjoy the free presents while we look into things. The perk cards this was a while back. This is a great time to open them all and get those free rewards
---
But they didn't.  We can complain all day about what they didn't do or we can make the best of what they did. I plan to make the best of it.
---
I'm a pretty new player, how does gum effect this?
---
Well I like this bug i didnt get to do it last year
---
"Well Rested" gives 5% XP gain for 2 hours. Earned from using a bed.
---
"Well Tuned" is AP Regeneration. Earned from playing an instrument. 
---
"Lover's Embrace" is the same as the bed, but requires a romanced companion and is active for 3 hours I believe.
---
i didnt actually test it but people were saying that food weight buffs were not working..
---
have not seen that in a few hours tho.. ammo machine and the score not updating properly has kinda taken over the focus for the time being..
---
update: i played nuclear winter all day today and unlocked the 10mm pumpkin skin, the bats minigun skin and the jack o lantern skins!!
---
Why are you scrapping 308? You could have traded that for 556 in a 1:1 ratio.
---
Yeah. That's how I've interpreted the game as well.
---
It Never stops.
---
Or we can do both!  Use it as is it, and give them the feedback they need to make it better.  It's not one or the other.
---
shut up before the fix it, time to grind again for these rewards!
---
I got 999 problems but a water wheel ain't one.
---
Fait accompli, dad can I have the keys for the car.
---
I can live without the Planetarium Lamp at L100. That reduces my 'must reach' to just L85 for the Space Explorerr Jangkes Backpack - easy!
---
&gt;Unless they do bonus points or double points or have an unannounced interest cap (like at 2,500 instead of every level adding 25 more points),
---
I’m going to withhold judgement until we know for sure that it’s not capped.  I’ll let a week go by and see what people are seeing, I hit 10 today but expect the progress to slow down greatly since the weeklies are done
---
All we asked for was a way of breaking down unused ammo in to crafting components
---
For a while now my terminals have been almost impossible to read. I don't know what prompted it, but when I activate a terminal, my view doesn't "zoom in" all the way, and what I see is what you'd see if you were standing about 5 feet away from the screen. The text is barely legible as well. So this new device is really giving me a hard time.
---
Is there a button to change the view on a terminal, like there is between the PipBoy's skinned view and power armor view, that I've possibly accidentally activated?
---
It's a bug, but as a guy who loves CAMPs, it's actually really useful because now I don't have to grind  for like 2 weeks straight at  the end of the year.
---
Honestly just a good reason to play NW.
---
And no raspberry beret...
---
I removed everything on that floor, even the roof and what not. Didn't work 😂 I just build a new camp.
---
Rank 78, but do I have room for Bessie the Brahmin &amp; Chickens???
---
Fuck man, I’m gonna hop on and get those rewards! Thanks for letting me know!
---
You don't get any, at least I didn't. I think the post meant you get score when they are part of challenges.  Pretty weak since the only way outside of challenges is 10k per 100 points of score.
---
So to be fair I didn’t read a lot about it other then bits here and there, but I also thought the same as you. The line “earns score points just playing how you normally would” gave me the impression I could level up just by killing things. I did see someone post today’s daily challenges and they are super easy but it does seem like I’ll need to log in daily. It is what it is
---
&gt; "Well Rested" gives **100% XP** gain for **1 hour**. Earned from using a bed.
---
I’m about ***99.99%*** sure that’s not correct.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s +5% XP for two hours.
---
Just an ugly room and ugly objects. I generally try to make it so it seems like there are no generators at all.
---
It's under junk.  Scrap it to get the rewards.
---
That’s what I was assuming. At first I thought it was a way to gain boosted score rates if your pass him.
---
You don’t dial it down when you group up? Huh
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
seems weird it is charging some people. It must only be a small problem as i'd expect more posts about it
---
The Backwoods Bungalow, previously available in the Atomic Shop, no longer has collision on the windows or rear of the structure, meaning that Patch 19/20 has broken existing paid content.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Awe rats, that does make sense. Still, what silly thing to focus efforts on patching out.
---
Level 50 players, not 50 players.
---
I noticed how crisp the sounds and pop ups for the reward are too, kinda unusual for beth to be honest lol
---
It was delayed because people weren't happy with the perks, it's now coming at a future date and will hopefully be a lot better
---
Today we got the season, public teams, and a crapload of bug fixes
---
And some new bugs
---
&gt;Q: ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
It should be getting awarded for public events outside of challenges according to the FAQ. Hopefully it's not another bug.
---
Well it's much better than the Armco vending machine, it isn't meant to replace ammo crafting though hence the caveat.
---
Not that I can see.
---
Have you adjusted  your FoV sliders? If you have it dragged all the way up, it affects the terminals also. Unfortunately.
---
You get a stick of gum every 5 levels and that gum can be chewed to complete a daily task when it comes up.
---
I'm thinking something along the lines of a system where you can deposit a limited number of caps per day with no long term limit within the bank. So carried would be capped at 30k, daily deposit would be capped at like 10k for instance, but all money in excess to 30k on the character would automatically be deposited into the bank if generated by player vendors. Would save people from losing 9ut on so many caps.
---
I wish but I'm going to guess you're just getting lucky lol I have to imagine if they did that it'd be in the patch notes, if for no reason other than the good will it would bring
---
Ikr? It's all complaining
---
You can always just not engage people.  Turn on pacifist and turn it off again if you think it's a fair fight you want to participate in.
---
It’s what’s kept me from doing some of the public events in adventure mode. Sometimes I don’t feel like finding a stash and grabbing a crap weapon, so I don’t even bother attending.
---
I put my survaval tent close to the corpse just to ft to a fissure site. Try to kill her a little bit away from respawn area. Today i did the quest being a part of the team and everyone else got like 25% of caps reward every time i complete the quest. Grab ur friends to do same thing and I guess it will be the win win win stratergy.
---
Radiation Rumble spawns a lot aswell, found around 5 or 6 there
---
Yea what a waste of time... like come on Bethesda 
---
Why is it that every single thing added to fallout 76 is so Horrible 
---
We can only convert 12 ammo per click and it cap at 2000 point per day? We got people with thousands of unless ammo
---
If this shit was on PTS it probably wouldn’t have release
---
Shhh!...don't curse it.
---
FO76 Reddit Rule #1 - never talk good of the game.
---
My very first session post update my food and drink weight reductions were not working at all. Thankfully hoping to a different server fixed it for me.
---
I don't think Inspirational works with Public Teams... May be wrong.
---
The queen
---
SHE NEVER LANDS
---
BAHHHHH!!!
---
You’re welcome!
---
They are probably the ones following people. Do vault dwellers really like leashing dead schorchbeasts?
---
No worries. It sounds more like it may be related to the new patch and its a bit chaotic and hard to tell if things are new bugs, or just a fluke. Normal servers are generally pretty stable, but its not uncommon to need to switch every so often. Might just need to wait a couple of days. 
---
Most events are soloable with the exception of the ones with an exclamation point such as Scorched earth, project paradise, and radiation rumble. Otherwise once you get a decent build and good gear you shouldn't have issues with just about anything.
---
Stealth rifles with silencers or Power Armor heavy gunner are both solid options.
---
Tesla rifles are amazing for tagging, every time someone is one shotting stuff I wish I had a spare to drop at their feet
---
Mirelurk Kings loud yelling spam, and feral ghouls giving me rad worms by just looking in my direction.
---
Sounds like someone has your password.
---
You got awarded the 1000 score at 3/5.
---
I suppose but honestly where does that get us? How much have they really fixed based on player feedback?
---
True enough.
---
Hmm possibly, I'll have to look at that next time I get on. Thanks.
---
Upvoting hard for shield reference!
---
I already knew all the rested benefits but this new status says very well rested and it gives 50% exp boost.
---
Oh that the game play of Mr. Dean "26 minutes" Takahashi, thx for that I was in need of a good laughter.
---
Why is our patience always rewarded with disappointment.
---
Over it.
---
Well I mean you could always just have some ribeye for dinner... there should be plenty of room for chickens after that.
---
Pero yo instale ingles y anduvo 10 puntos. Después tuve que descargar español de vuelta porque se me complico con perks y todas las cosas del inventario tienen otros nombres. A parte en español las frases son mucho mas divertidas. Especialmente de los calcinados y sr. manoso. 600 horas en el juego y todavía me divierto como por la primera vez.
---
Ok, makes sense, you make use of the fusion gen and conduits? Could make a really "clean" look. I have a fusion gen and sparingly use use the conduits, but if trying to go for very clean look, it could be brought to fruition
---
It’s super cute
---
Lol it’s Bethesda’s way to drip feed very minor content that most don’t want while forcing you to buy atoms on the things you do
---
Hard to say, because challenges in the next week's might offer more points. Reaching 100 without doing all weekly and daily challenges seems kind of impossible right now imo. Even if they increase the number of points granted by challenges, you'll probably have to do a lot of them, so you'd need to use some time to do things you normally might not do. The daily challenges today at least were less time consuming than the ones for atoms.
---
The daily challenges are the ones that award score, from your map menu. 
---
You did 8 daily missions from your pip boy.
---
I just shuddered thinking about how the server performance would tank if 50 players were all in the burrows at the same time
---
Did about 25 events today in a public team and no extra Score at all.  So hopefully it's a bug because then time gating a season pass is ridiculous.
---
It's from one of the lunchboxes. It's a score reward
---
I’m getting the Halloween rewards right now.
---
It's 10 weeks according to the [splash screen in the game.](https://i.imgur.com/VBnk8Hu.jpg)
---
Yeah OP this is studio level stuff, I’d def watch more of these!  Would be pretty bad ass to create a short story with some action, but I can’t imagine how long it takes to write, develop, and direct.  Mucho respect!
---
An the categories that is broken down into makes no sense either, should just be the exact same as it is on the crafting bench.
---
Ammo,
---
Energy ammo,

Explosive ammo.
---
How is it that hard to make a quick slider aswell, fine they have to be in quantities I get that, but let me trade as much as I can all at once.
---
WHY TF are the Blackbird paints so damn expensive?!?!? They're just black with a little bit of red striping and some alpha-numerics and they want to charge 1440?!?!! The American Patriot paints have more going on with them and yet they're only 700?!?! The pricing on a lot of these Atom Shop items is absurd.
---
If anything they will raise them. To fuck players even more.
---
But the Ammo Converter's menu is well made, I would even say its very well made.....  
---
....... to make people hate it and stop using it.
---
Mods should create a vent post.... seriously, how many are we up to now?
---
Same. It's been a huge help finding groups to play with. Some of us arent stuck grinding for legendaries yet. If they're bored they should play something else. I still can't wrap my head around the mentality of playing something for hundreds if not thousands of hours and complaining it isn't enough...its delusional and unhealthy.
---
Ah ok that makes sense then. I remember one of those lunchbox symbols pop up in the top left. Kind of weird naming it very well rested. Should have named it something else. Thx for the reply.
---
Eh, I honestly couldn't give a damn about the late tier rewards. PA reskins don't interest me, and even then the whole space asthetic doesn't stick with me. I'll just grab what I can, the camp items in the early and mid tiers seem much more achievable.
---
Must have year 10 gally and destiny 15 preordered. Send pic to confirm!
---
I can confirm this. Got a christmas reward when I wanted to test if Nuclear Winter can finally be started without having to change the game language to english as mentioned in the patch notes. Not sure if I should grind for the missed rewards.
---
For me it’s assaultrons and any high ranking mister gutsy.
---
I'm sorry to ask and I think I know the answer, but were they the exclamation mark public events as apposed to the events without the exclamation mark. The same ones that give you treasury notes.
---
Sorry if I sound like I think you're thick, I'm just trying to figure out if it's even worth trying for rank 100.
---
I run a two shot exp gat as my main and a two shot ffr prime light machine gun.   SS armor or excavator power armor.    I can go anywhere and do anything I want.    Absolutely nothing fancy about my build.    
---
Been rocking this for over 300 levels.   I am 570 now.
---
Just play how you want to play and have fun.    Anything can work with a little tuning.
---
Actually had people at project paradise and 2 survivors for once
---
I mean, we just got it...
---
I'd say do it that way you can farm the rare apparels in the upcoming holidays
---
It's not, I'm in a FB group and they confirmed it works
---
I got some from an explosives box.  PC
---
It still works?
---
Cave crickets.  Freaky little bastards.
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
Skill, practice, and experience.
---
Yeah it's just harder
---
Both but 90% ! Events
---
Gonna have to grind a bunch then pay to play with those atoms gained during the grind...
---
Stingy bois wit their fuckin poison damage over time.
---
https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/xfi-port-forwarding
---
Do you happen to know what the difference is?
---
Instigating sneak build sounds fun. I’ve never personally done it but I’ve wanted to try. Seems like it would be shit for the queen though.
---
My experience today. Two legendary enemies, both 3 star, completely disappeared after I killed them. The sheepsquatch dropped a one star instigating lead pipe. Pretty regular day.
---
I hope it’s not just me getting lucky lol, they’ve done silent buff before so if they did it again this time, they deserve a big THANK YOU. I don’t mind if the three star drops are all ghoul slayers, but guaranteed three star drop brings the boss fights to new heights and will make more players participate.
---
sounds like it might be time for me to hug some bushes
---
Yes they tested it. It's working for their purposes. You're not here to have fun. YOU'RE HERE TO GRIND.
---
not sure about most annoying but mole rats because every time you go to kill them they just dig underground
---
lol
---
I spent so much tedious time drawing dirty water  before I figured out you can just spam X and get 50 dirty waters in a few seconds without waiting for the prompt to refresh.  This sounds like that.
---
Okay thanks. I'm pretty much screwed for level 100 then if each rank adds 25 SCORE to the total. I don't do NW and can't guarantee I'll get on long enough to do every daily challenge every single day.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help.
---
Love the idea!
---
I have the same issue :(
---
God I really don’t understand why people expect things to be made well in a Bethesda game anymore.
---
Sheepsquatch or the imposter assaultron? Sheepsquatch in the wild always drop one star, I’ve only seen higher loot in Project Paradise event.
---
wait, sorry, how do you get these?
---
Sorry. Imposter.
---
Exactly. Make it like the barter UI where we can just scroll down our ammo list and click-confirm a transfer. It's so painfully obvious. They already built the damn UI for it, they just chose to go with the worst possible iteration of it in the game. 
---
Everyone should be pissed. This is a shining example of how inept they apparently are at implementing elements from a game/engine that already exists. There's no excuse!
---
i got them from playing nuclear winter. i read earlier on here today that people were getting christmas and halloween rewards, and they definitely werent lying.
---
It is tradeable and the only other way
---
I was wondering about this too. I've killed 9 3-star enemies today and all 9 have dropped 3-star legendaries. Don't know if I've been really lucky or if something changed?
---
holy moly - just by playing!?
---
Lmao, then I found out I could just "go back to main menu"
---
Nope, when I was referring to voice chat it was actually another group in area chat. Personally I rarely use it, so it feels like these teams were made for me. Just join up and have fun!
---
Escape will get you out if you’re on PC.
---
To establish a network connection we need the ip address and tcp or udp port#
---
TCP/ port 80 is for web or http
---
TCP / port 443 is for secure web or https.
---
Port forwarding is telling your router that any connections coming into my address and this specific port, forward that connection to this internal Ip address.
---
Depending on the firewall or router it could be set up in different ways.
---
You will need to find out which port or ports need to be forwarded to your console.    Also your console would need a static ip address as the port forwarding will point at an ip address.   If your console rebooted and got another address then this would not work.
---
You have reached your max budged, you need to delete something first to add more objects
---
Nice thanks. 
---
I’m off looking for one then. Or maybe an alt account. Then I can also get that radicals mask
---
yepp!! i played one character to overseer rank 6, then switched to another to get easy levels and had them all unlocked by rank 6 and rank 3 on the other toon.
---
I'm not sure, the latest patch was supposed to help with this I think.
---
I've just read the FAQ again and it's possible that this season is 11 weeks. They said "Season 1 begins June 30 and runs through mid-September." 15th Sept is 11 weeks from now.
---
woah, thats insane. thank you so much for the heads up... how did you know they were unlocked? just checking in your camp?
---
I also noticed this, but the weird thing its only doubled when in a team.
---
When playing solo ribeye still has +20 carry weight and scorchbeast brain +3 INT. 
---
But in a team (even when you are alone in a public team) it jumps to +40 carry weight and +6 INT.
---
And with "Strange in Numbers" perk this can be pushed to +50 carry weight and +7.5 INT.
---
There is also some inside of Morgantown Highschool right after you enter the building. Go down the stairs to the right when you walk in and it should be on a small table at the bottom.
---
&gt; Do devs actually play this game? 
---
No. I think that has been pretty obvious since launch.
---
Why didn't they just do it like the legendary exchange smh
---
This games bias against PvP is exactly why you get griefed. No other reasonable outlet. Nuclear Winter isn’t what people asked for.
---
Thanks in part to the damn terminal the thing is also so fucking wide that I had nowhere to permanently place it in my camp and just threw it down in the middle of my garage with the intent or storing it and plopping it out on an as needed basis.
---
I know that feeling. My main character has well over 1k screws, my 2nd character is lvl 60 something &amp; I don't even have 50. Can't figure why since I've not been crafting anything like guns or power armor.
---
Wow that’s impressive. Maybe not specifically the bosses but they buffed the chance for three star to actually drop three star.
---
Team play and solo play are really different beasts of the same game. The differences make it better to be capable in both.
---
69 caps. All my bulks are flat rate of 69 except for steel, that's 49.
---
I just got this thing and I cannot say how awful it is.
---
It's slow.
---
It's clunky.
---
It has a point buy limit, for no reason.
---
It involves me hitting enter on the keyboard for 3 minutes just to hit point cap. Then, finding ammo I want to buy is hidden by terrible menus. 
---
I know the terminals are qwirky and cute, and it was what people in this universe had to use. Don't impose that horrible "OS" on us, unnessisarily. There is a trade function built into the game. Trade my ammo for points, fine, but not 24 at a time for an hour.
---
Who designed this? why? I want someone to answer for their work, like, explain the working out. Why did this become the solution to the problem of having too much ammo.
---
Thank you! Judging from how quickly you found this, I assume I need to explain that I did indeed Google how to do this, but there are so many abbreviations and unexplained technical jargon that I could not make heads or tails. I'll give this a look.
---
got that and AC Valhalla waiting to go.
---
ah damn, i was looking forward to the radiation perk and getting rid of radaway.   
---
thanks!
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
It's almost like the development team is very small and there's limited collaboration between members so ideas aren't discussed and refined. Like 1 person has an idea and that initial implementation is what makes it to the final game with no discussion or revision.
---
You saw what happened with Legendary Perks. They were released to the PTS and unanimously criticised, justifiably as 95% of them were useless. So they are going back to drawing board to fix them. Which is how game development should be.
---
Jumping on top comment but:
---
I edited my maths (link lower down) and found the total to be 220,275. And it's possible this season is 11 weeks rather than 10 as Beth said "Season 1 begins June 30 and runs through mid-September" and 15th Sept is 11 weeks away. 
---
Also, SCORE is meant to be awarded for public events, but I'm not sure how much.
---
The ammo converter... and out of joke i would say Ghouls at low levels, they were a pain because they are rather OP dealing a ton of radiation damage, at high level probably Yao Guai, not because of the damage, but they stagger me way too much and prevents me from doing anything lol
---
Thank you. Is there a way to set a static IP address for the PS4? Does my router have a static IP? Are these ports actually physical objects like an Ethernet port, or are they internet thingies. My knowledge of computers is abysmal for a 30 year old.
---
Yep. I already deleted it from my camp. Not to mention I can only get 600 5mm ammo from the ridiculous cap they put on it. So 30 minutes to traverse the terrible interface for enough ammo to last about 30 seconds. No thanks.
---
*Mr. Pebbles liked that.*
---
You're a good man.
---
Why they didn't float that or have a key press toggle for that UI on the board is a total overlook. It's like they literally don't care or employ anyone in regards to UX. The pipboy menus certainly *look* good, but everything about using them is a bloody nightmare.
---
It’sHORRIBLE!!!
---
Yeah, but honestly I'm not really a fan of the appearance of any of the generators. Maybe if they released a nukacola skin for the fusion or something.
---
If you're xb1 I wouldn't mind showing off a build or 2.
---
Hmm I’ll play some more and report back. I’ve done so many SBQs it has NEVER happened before for them to drop three-star items back to back in a row four times. Never before.
---
they came up as rewards in the lower left of my screen. youre very welcome and i hope you get some. i missed the halloween stuff and im so happy right now haha.
---
I noticed that too.
---
Ya, your head goes into the keyboard when you try to use in PA lol
---
What system?
---
Great thank you
---
Yeah, I'll give 'em credit for this, it's a gorgeous menu.
---
Just tried now, no luck
---
They have time gated everything in the game and I was still shocked they time gated a season pass.  Super ridiculous in my opinion. Not a great way to appease the new player /casual player base.
---
I saw people over 12, and someone claimed to be level 20, though that sounded more like second hand rumors.
---
It does get harder with each level (need more xp from 99-100 than from 9-10), not sure what that will do to the effort.
---
Doesn't appear huge for me, are you using a monitor?
---
I'm using a TV but it's not that big and its not in the way nor a problem
---
You can hold down the cancel button to leave the screen it helps some.
---
It's definitely meant to. 
---
Can't confirm right now, although I didn't notice it on screen when I did Campfire Tales a while ago.
---
The exchange rate is crap anyway. I set one up by my vendors if anyone actually feels like using it.
---
Anything with disease
---
Ps4 :)
---
Name is the same as here, add me and we can join up.
---
I started saving ammo for this thing, meaning I have several thousands of rounds saved up, and it's telling me I have to trade them in *15 at a time*, and I have to go through *three* terminal screens every single time? And then once you hit the arbitrary limit of 2000 points, you have to switch to *buying* ammo - which has the same 12 at a time, three screens per transaction bullshit - before you can go back to spamming the fucking sell button. And the exchange rate is not even 1:1 for the exact same ammo - selling .45s gets you 30 points, but buying back the *exact* same ammo in the *exact* same quantity costs you *150* points??
---
What. The. Actual. FUCK. Bethesda.
---
There's even a fucking *typo* in the first screen, just to really drive home how fucking little thought was put into this travesty.
---
i dunno, soundboards can be insanely funny. I'm a sucker for that stuff.
---
I hope its just a bug. If we can get points from public events ill show up to every event lol
---
Exactly
---
#Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Was just there and all the ghouls were really low level, aren't they usually high level?
---
Ticks.
---
In the FAQ on the info page about seasons it says they should.
---
Q: ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events.
---
But at the moment it seems they don't. I'm gonna wait to see whether it's a bug that they don't give SCORE or if the info page is giving an incorrect statement, before I draw a conclusion on how hard it will be to get rank 100.
---
Unfortunately I have already seen posts claiming that this still happens.
---
Need to spread this like wildfire so they hopefully change it
---
So grind as much as possible while holding onto my FO1st atoms to get through the rest of the way if needs be. Got it.
---
"Kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume"
---
Okay. But ***why***...?
---
Use a lunch box, +25% xp, eat cranberry cobbler +5% xp, well rested is +5% xp, and if you use the event team by yourself it's +25% xp for events.
---
So completing an event at this point would give you +60% more XP.
---
The higher your INT the more XP you earn too. So unyielding builds will always make this easier.
---
Haha
---
Fucking mole rats. They aren't even worth the bullet but they will follow you til the end of time so you have to kill em.
---
Back to main menu or hold B if your on Xbox to completely exit
---
I only wanted to gring for the Ghillie armors, BUT THEY FORGOT THE RAIDER AND THE TRAPPER VERSIONS
---
I’ve run into this weird infinite tunneling often while owning a workshop ...I have the same problem but not as often with the scorpions...soooo annoying
---
Ahhh XB1 but happy trails and happy hunting
---
The real enemy there is dumbasses on the fence.
---
When you convert the ammo you can press (B on Xbox) to return to the previous screen to skip all the main menu crap.
---
For instance "Convert 12 rounds of .308" then you go into the next screen and press B so you'll be back at the "Convert 12 rounds of .308"
---
It does, after all they are all copy/pasted from FO4 and they are. not exactly attractive
---
radical mask is worthless now, since their legendary effects are removed - it's just a ordinary mask without any benefits.
---
you won't need an alt account, just create a new char - you can have up to 5 on one account.
---
I still haven't joined because I'm only like level 75 or something with a plain non bloodied non junkies build and everyone else is level 100-300. I worry that I'd slow people down. And I don't know how long I can stay on each time and it takes awhile to bond, so that's another downside if I join them and then have to leave.
---
As someone who never cared about any of the challenges, I don’t see myself making it very far. I can barely bring myself to log on to do events for treasury notes, let alone daily and weekly challenges. This is just a distraction from lack of good content. My 2c.
---
Sounds like my ex
---
So I did it an now I have a few Halloween and Xmas exclusives
---
Using an xbox one controller on PC to navigate the board. Wayyyyy too sensitive and impossible to hover over a space. Anybody else?
---
Hmm well I’m a collector... lol 
---
But yeah that’s also what I meant. My bad
---
this kind of discussion is not allowed here.
---
just a quick reminder, this topic is a reason to get banned in this sub.
---
That’s the enemy I died the most to, charred ghouls second place
---
I got downvoted to oblivion when I questioned that little gem after they posted it..
---
absolutely decimated...
---
1. Adrenaline is broken
---
2. You can't craft any mods to the secret service under armor.
---
Uh it's not 2000 per day, just fill your points up. Buy ammo and you can fill it up again
---
Ask your mother.
---
bethesda is literaly our worst enemy.
---
Ooh okay I didn’t last long I only converted 3 times before I dip out
---
I thought I heard it was delayed.
---
Can confirm. I love my instigating plasma rifle for stealth rifleman. Easily one shot anything within reason. Anything boss related and you might as well tickle it instead.
---
Why should I? In no online game have I ever needed to say "hey guys remember to use a crappy weapon so we can all get a hit in" that's just dumb.
---
This is why I only solo. I get all the loot and XP, problem solved. I made this post so Bethesda could hopefully see what's wrong here and change it.
---
judging from some of the numbers ive seen people throwing around.. they should be bi-annual...
---
I don't have any lunch boxes, no cobbler either. Tried using the team function but the other members kept coming to me and getting in my way killing stuff. I play solo so having people come by me getting in my way is a huge pain in the ass. I'm usually well rested but don't really keep track of it. I'm also low Int, haven't had the need for it before. So yeah...not gonna work lol.
---
Posts like this made me quit long ago and when I still see posts like this over a year later I wonder what the heck the devs and Bethesda are thinking. It’s like they have idea people and devs but no gamers on their staff roster.
---
Let your ammo producer work on 5mm or .44 that way you'll get more profit in points compared to the bullets you gotta give
---
I thought it was the service rifle.from.new Vegas.
---
It honestly looks like they tacked the terminal on as a complete afterthought
---
I don't recall there being one, my point is more that the mechanics of making, breaking down and making seperate ammo types are things that can and have been coded into the engine.
---
I converted 300 rounds of 5.56, 100 railway spikes and 1300 .308 then turned all of it into 2mm so that's how i found out
---
All I have is Glowing meat steak and it is +20%
---
The cook stove text under the crafting menu says 10%, but the pipboy says 20%
---
For other meats the Item Stat box shows the increased value.
---
yeah.. its fuckin borked yo.. no doubt
---
And they even pushed back the event because it was too buggy....so this stuff counted as 'stable' in comparison? Don#t even want to know what could've happened if they pushed the event and legendary perks anyway
---
I do not have a console so I can’t say with any certainty.    You can look in the network section of the settings.   
---
Your router likely has a static address on the inside but dhcp on the outside.
---
You can try googling you router manufacturer and port forwarding and you should find some links on how to do it.
---
&lt;stares nervously at almost 5,000 rounds of .44 in stash&gt;
---
Yeah it got Bethesda'd.
---
The menu completely lags out for me and I'm on XboneX and run an external SSD
---
Definitely more time went into that than the ammo converter
---
You can set up a static IP in the network settings of the PS4. Your router has one, it is the default gateway of your network and generally 192.168.0.1 as default. The ports are not physical ports, it's just a destination for traffic. 
---
So:
---
First set your ps4 to a static ip with the same first set of digits as your router, for example 192.168.0.5. (If that is your routers range).
---
Login to your router.
---
Find your routers port forwarding section.
---
Put the IP address of your computer or gaming console in the appropriate box in your router.
---
Put the TCP and UDP ports for your game in the corresponding boxes in your router
---
For fallout the ports are:
---
TCP: 1935,3478-3480
---
UDP: 3000-3010,3074,3478-3479
---
Honestly though, I think it's more to do with the powerline set up. Is there no way you could connect it direct to your outer by WiFi/Cable? I've never had an issue on a much slower connection than you and I didn't set up forwarding.
---
They just need to hand the entire franchise over to obsidian at this point
---
I wonder why dromedary never breaks...
---
A perfect example of Butthesda making a system, not testing it out or fleshing it out, and abandoning it. 
---
The whole game system is now a relic, a skeleton, and the bones are all of these abandoned, half developed systems. It's a like a human body but the lungs work at 25% capacity, the bones constantly break and need resetting, only to break again before fully healing. The liver is shot so there is no security and bugs and dupes run rampant and break the body down further. The brain has a hard time keeping all the malfunctioning body parts working in harmony y so the body stutters and stalls constantly. Nobody excercises or gives proper TLC to the body so when it IS put under stress it completely crumbles under the pressure. 
---
It's got a kind of pretty face and was a cute kid though, so we keep it around.
---
I lost the gift emote 2 weeks ago
---
The obsidian you want, isn't the same obsidian that made New Vegas.
---
This logic is akin to a king distributing rotten food to his starving subjects, and you're standing in the corner going "Look all we asked for was some food we didn't say we wanted fresh unspoiled food".
---
Oh yea I forgot how good those are for that. I've been using a flame thrower to tag mobs but ammo isn't easy to make/find.
---
you would think by now people would have learned to be careful what you ask these derps for..
---
was obvious that they made the cap tight.
---
if someone reach a higher rank, but miss some days he probably buy the missing levels to finish it  since he already put so much work into it.
---
it's a psychological trick so players are buying the last few ranks.
---
um
---
Its possible this season is 11 weeks. 
---
&gt;Season 1 begins June 30 and runs through mid-September.
---
15th Sept is 11 weeks away.
---
Why does Bethesda not want us to use .308?
---
Yea I’ve seen the numbers, and though some of them make a fair amount of assumptions it sure seems like even a fairly dedicated player will have difficulty finishing the Legendary Run w/o using atoms
---
It was pushed to another due to multiple issues.
---
I have the same problem
---
leave some room for the adrenaline perk will ya?
---
That's ridiculous, they're a bunch of fucking morons.
---
So much shit, every new update comes a wave of shit.
---
Bethesda project manager: “does it work?”
---
Programmer: “yes but...”
---
Project manager: “cool release it and move onto more atom shop skins”
---
Of course it was. Alright thanks. I’m gonna delete this post now
---
I had a red asylum dress and a traveling leather coat disappear. And no telling what else.
---
As someone will next to no free time to play lately, meh. 
---
The rewards for the season aren't even that enticing. I don't think any of the paints look cool, and I have no interest in any of the camp items or skins. The theme of Season 1 is really lame overall. 
---
And if season 2 or beyond actually has stuff that I do want, then I really won't mind playing to unlock or even paying to get it. I work hard for my money and if I want to treat myself to some in game purchases then that's my right to do so. 
---
If anyone saw seasons as endgame type content or anything other that another grind for cosmetics, then you fantasized something that didn't exist to begin with. Bethesda merely gave atomic shop items that you have the option to either pay or play to earn. And of course they're going to make it easier and convenient to pay vs play. The grind heavy players can spend their days gaining levels while the whales can buy their way through. No promises were ever made that everyone would make it to the end and get all the rewards, just that everyone has the option to if they want it bad enough.
---
How are you having trouble finding crater and foundation?
---
Well here’s a big 🤞🏻 for that, but if the cutoff for the 11th week is before new weekly challenges come out it won’t be too much of a cushion
---
If you turn ultracite ammo in normal ammo they have to give you flux so they won't do that
---
It was pushed to another update due to multiple issues.
---
I ran into the same thing.
---
Yes. It's a simple thing for sure. But in my experience as a pen tester and security analyst you'd be amazed how simple logic can wreck a person while coding. Lol.
---
They do. I've got two sets of Unyielding armor. One Trapper, the other Marine. Helps a lot with rad management, though the rad resistance is a +/- kinda deal. (Need dirty water/toxic goo to build rads.)
---
I have FO1ST, just to preface, so i can make a public team in my private lobby and enjoy at least a bit of benefit without needing anyone else.
---
But im on Rank 9 of the season after about 6 hours of play today. A lot of the weekly challenges are really simple to complete, like building stuff in a workshop.  Just build so much then scrap then rebuild and youre done.
---
Killing certain robots.. go to watoga. 
---
I'm not defending bethesda seemingly pulling it so close to the chest to complete the season, but i am saying the dailies and weeklies are not hard to pull off. Within a few hours I had completed almost all of them.
---
I want an Esc button on my controller now
---
Mathh is hourd
---
Seems like a job for autohotkey, not that we should have to be doing that at all in the first place.
---
Have they said when it could possibly release?
---
they probably realized it isn't advertised as decoration and just strapped it together with the personal terminal prop in order to give it a interface in the very last seconds.
---
Reminds me of Fallout 3
---
Last bit I heard was possibly update 21.
---
It’s made by Bethesda, how the fuck can anything they do actually shock us?
---
They're all using the various exploits to one shot everything so yeah, thirteen .38s lasted them a good long while, I'm *sure*.
---
Speaking of that anyone have suggestions for 3 points in agi for a heavy gunner?
---
Great, hopefully its soon
---
You have the option of booting people from the team, though.
---
I think he ment to get to level 5 on the board and get the converter but I think both were faster
---
The whole staff because they plan on releasing the ammo converter MK II on the atom shop?
---
"If you're tryna convert ammo, I feel bad for you, son..."
---
When I was grinding to 100, I dedicated my characters special to use all the DMG Perks in NW. So I was running Master Commando, Bloody Mess, Tenderiser, Adrenaline and Tank Killer. It was glorious,  like players were made out of paper. That's how I'd guess. That and skill.
---
Same, fingers crossed. Along with them making it so public events give SCORE as intended. 
---
15th Sept would be a Tuesday so in line with the refresh, giving you 11 weeks of challenges to complete.
---
5 here
---
Unfortunately this has been around since Update 19. Maybe earlier.
---
Scrapping too fast AND selling to a vendor too fast, can cause it to bug out and pull things from other categories.
---
Didn’t know VATS doesn’t work with the Handmade ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I'm tempted to move them because I dont think it will be anytime soon.
---
Fuck that guy, he never leaves his supply store.
---
&lt;pulls up a chair for you&gt; Here ya go, its gonna be a while bud..
---
Atleast the challenges are bugged and give you the score at 3/5 progress already.
---
I know what they meant and I meant what I said too
---
Still wish I could have seperate special for NW
---
While at the same time gladly paying the king's increased taxes.
---
They were probably just cheating if you are on pc. NW belongs to the cheaters on pc. At least he wasn't flying in your description. Even former csgo pros aren't that accurate, source shroud was streaming NW when it came out. Maybe Simple is secretly playing the game and you met him
---
I totally agree!!! I hate those things for the exact same reason.
---
It looks like it adds 50 or so xp each level from what I have noticed so it would more than likely just progress in increments that size.
---
Action Boy/Girl 3?
---
Foundation is a big green blob it's not the problem. Crater is a little blue dot in the toxic valley that I mistake for the five blue dots next to it.
---
What I'm pissed about is i use to find things by there proximity to workshops and fissures, but workshops and fissures don't stand out anymore. 😔
---
Did the same with camp fires
---
It's beautiful.
---
I thing this is the proof that they do play the game... what else in the game doesn’t require spamming buttons?  Ever cooked 100 corn soups?  I have. Was it fun?  Nope. But I needed that soup!
---
If the +25 each level is maintained, level 99-100 would need 3425.
---
How were people not finding the rusty pick?
---
Foundation and Crater are cities, they should stand out more.
---
i dig them for sure, how do you leave the group though? the only way i could do it was by leaving the server and i hope theres a better way. please enlighten me
---
Got bunch of powdered vanguard so I only run 1.  Mabye bump it to 2 and move the other 2 to luck.
---
Scorched
---
Oh havent seen that, thanks for the update, i just looked at my calender and counted full weeks till mid september. 10 weeks ist beginning september \~6th
---
I was making a joke about one the other options for the Power Cycle 1000. But, you're also right.
---
For crater you just go to the top right of toxic valley
---
*too
---
My thoughts exactly I spent close to ten mins spamming A to convert 2,000 points of ten mill just to release that I was going to have to spam again to convert to 5mm and said f it. Based on how my mini eats ammo I guess it will take an hour to fire my mini for 2 min. Hopefully they’ll fix but...
---
Don't forget to share a perk!
---
It's fantastic, I agree. I have been playing the game with friends so I have 9 charisma so I can share out a rank 3 perk. I typically share out through-hiker since I refuse to play without it, frees up people to use other agi perks.
---
Focus on sharing things that are universally handy and not build-specific. Even sharing a 1 star perk can be immensely helpful!
---
Yeah, I feel this. I guess it pushes people to get FO1st but.... for what..? The same dailies and events we've been doing since launch?
---
I think this is a bit disingenuous. Before FO76, they constantly released critically acclaimed excellent titles. The only one that was truly "not consensus excellent" was FO4 and that game still is pretty beloved and sold/still sells insanely well.
---
The modding community is wonderful but dont act like BGS releases games that arent finished on purpose so random people can fix it for them. There are a multitude of reasons why their games are buggy (pre-76) and "they do it on purpose" isnt one of them.
---
The (main) development team in Texas for 76 is not big either, relatively speaking, from what I gather. Doesnt excuse the issues per se, but it explains them in a correct way that doesnt demean them. Makes more sense to say "they made a mistake because of a lack of refinement/revision, and itll likely be fixed later" and not "these morons dont play the game!!!" lol. The ammo converter thing is a mistake but dont equate mistakes with "they misunderstand the basics". Feels like a very armchair game developer attitude.
---
Its under the avr medical building
---
Eventually the thousands of rounds will be gone and people will start using it as intended; to trade in the handful of rounds you inadvertently pick up in your travels and it won't be a big deal anymore.
---
Obviously. They want you to live on the game, as is the object of any battle pass style mechanic.
---
Haven't logged in tonight since my download is 2.5 hours.  Isn't the matchmaker pairing ppl with some sort of level range? I'm only a lvl 22...
---
Kind of disappointing considering I used them to protect the workshop claim station from other players though to be fair it didn't work much lmao.
---
Thing is spending hours to complete these is keeping me from playing as I want. It's a hassle I don't enjoy. I'm majority pissed about the removal of the Atoms. I'm ten short of buying something time limited in the shop. That's ten I would have earned from the dailies before before they fucked it up with this bullshit. So now I have to spend cash, which I will not do, or wait however long it takes me to get to step 9 and possibly miss the bundle. I'm on step five after about five hours of playing only to complete the new dailies. Five Hours for dailies.
---
Yeah thats best case scenario for sure. Is there a reason why this wasnt added to the PTS first?
---
From experience, it should be fine. Had this a few times after cutting power while it was on sleep mode. Rebuilt and everything was exactly as it was before.
---
You say that but two of my easy weekly challenges bugged so I can complete them...
---
Yeah, it borked my character in Adventure mode for a while. Worth it though for NW. If I got a kill-streak going with Adrenaline, I just had to look at players and they would drop dead.
---
I don't get this thing. Why is this so hard? Give it an input and output bin. The input bin works like the legendary scrip machines.  When you close the interface to that bin it makes a funny noise (or the same one if they want to be lazy). Then open the output bin.  Gunpowder, lead and steel - how much depends on what you put in.  Take that crap over to the tinker bench and make new ammo.
---
This thing is WAY over-engineered.  We just want some value for ammo we don't use.
---
I had something similar happen with my legendary armor while running Feed the People. Instead of dumping the veggies and fake meat it dropped two pieces of my armor. Sucked then too, I was only level 20-ish at the time.
---
You only get the 250 points for your first event?
---
yes.. and when you do complete it you dont get them because you got them early
---
I believe OP was being a little sarcastic.
---
Wait, what did they change about fissure sites?
---
tysm for the info!!
---
I agree. An exchange system like that of vendors indicating the total would be much easier. Anyway, once used a few times, it is not as slow as it seems, there are three clicks for each exchange, but you can do them without stopping because it automatically always repeats the one that is selected and only shows the bullets that you have and in each group already shows the bullets that are part of it. Once understood not complicated and not too slow, at first with thousands of bullets it can be, but then with doing it once per session, I think that in a few minutes everything is
---
Did you even read that? 🤔
---
I noticed it too.
---
Quick question from a lvl 50 who still feels like a noob - why do people do Feed the People over other quests? It takes forever and the enemies are typically low level. I always see that quest being done, but other level 40+ quests just completely not being tried at all. Have no clue why.
---
you dont get atoms anymore.. and adrenaline is definitely borked
---
Yeah before you edited it
---
Assaultron dominator are a pain In the ass
---
The main issue that I find is that this is a feature that should of been in the game a long time ago. I look forward to trying it tonight but seriously... this shouldn't have taken this long.
---
Yeah, this is like going around the block to cross the street.  Even a handful of .45 ammo have (1000 or so)  isn't worth the hassle.  I'll stick to scrounging lead and steel.
---
Vendor?
---
I just completed gather building supplies... and it gave zero score. I was at 950 before finishing it and 950 after finishing it. Is this a known bug?
---
They use to be gold. I'm assuming they changed them because they looked like vaults. 🤔
---
oops my b op if thats the case, my ragedar is causing interference at the moment.
---
I meant atoms from survival combat and social tabs and such. I received the atoms to my total, it just didn’t notify me.
---
Thanks took on the scorchbeast Queen with about 10 other people today and I was getting some damage with my railway rifle
---
Well that makes perfect sense
---
I just got an Instigating LVC fixer today and even though I’m bloodied sneak, I really like it.
---
First event I did was unwanted guests. 15 some people, it was crazy!
---
I can put flamer fuel in but can't get any out ? So disappointing, can't see me using it again and it was one of the few things I was actually interested in.
---
Idd say you deserve all the Christmas presents in the world for actually playing that garbage pile of a game mode
---
oh those.. 
---
well.. seeing how everything else is going today.. it doesnt surprise me one bit..
---
at least you got them.. lol
---
I added a sentence, I didn't change anything. 😂
---
I like that it’s gonna be a terminal. Feels like the right choice, terminals are pretty iconic to fallout. Also kinda makes sense if they have a limit to it. Can prob thank the dupers for cheating their way to having millions of ammo.
---
Probably possible to use it to steal or duplicate items.
---
Scrap it at a workbench maybe?
---
Checked today after the update was over and it’s just the level 30...sigh.
---
This is not how it should be or how it was described.
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YES... this needs streamlining SO BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
What? Am I reading right, I'm VERY new to the game, bought it 2 weeks ago and only been able to play a couple of times, I'm level 7. Could you please clarify this to me, I'm I going to stay on the lover levels for the eternity of this game?
---
hi daddy
---
Some people use an exploited gun like the SMG which benefits from pistol and rifle perks. It also works with the Gauss Shotgun, which benefits from shotguns and explosive. Exploits in NW (not hacks) are actually kind of tight-lipped because the tryhards don't like people sharing their advantages
---
Draining Tower of Pisa
---
I know just saying I typed it when you did it 🤣
---
Not an easy task if done without nukacrypt.com and/or wall glitch.  I did the first without... not sure about thre future though.  :)
---
Reach Score level 5
---
Anybody have a video of what the flyboy salute looks like?
---
(Also does that skin work for Handmades? Looks cool but if it can’t be attached to my B3325 Handmade I’ve got no use for it.)
---
That would seriously break my heart if that's something they "fixed". I'll test after this smoke.
---
This has been a thing since launch. With how broken this game is, it's no surprise that the garbage UIs and spamming don't go well together. Fun fact, in the past you used to be able to scrap your legendary gear by spamming
---
I came to the subreddit for the first time in like.. a month. With this post, I've counted 11.
---
Yea, makes lots of sense. I couldn't figure out why 10mm was on it twice, one of those times being energy ammo.
---
Thank you!!
---
Not bugs at all, just features. I hope they fix them cause i really would like this skin.
---
As a bloodied, full unyielding-wearing heavy weapons user, I agree. There’s no point to me touching armor that isn’t unyielding. A weapon has to be pretty good if it isn’t bloodied, but I used a bloodied 1 * assault rifle as my backup for ages because it did such more damage. 
---
I can make a ton of weapons and armor but I don’t because they are simply worse than anything else I have with a star. Only the new secret service stuff is worth making and that is such a grind to get the different mods I’ve just about given up. If there weren’t legendaries in the game, it would be such a different game.
---
I have not been receiving for public events, but also haven't been receiving for weekly challenges either.
---
I am almost wondering if the weekly challenge will rotate between xp and public events
---
I’m not even going to place it. I did, however, make a stack of 10 clean sinks.
---
As an old time modder for NV I have one insight:    
---
       
---
Terminal menus are quicker/easier to build than crafting menus (for work benches).       
---
      
---
Its not insanely harder. Its like the difference between sending a text message versus an email.      
---
I smell lazy :’(
---
I haven’t got the under armour yet (I haven’t done the wastelanders quest line yet).
---
Does it protect against water born diseases like the wetsuit?
---
Yeah I was looking forward to the 30% damage reduction myself before they delayed it, but none of the others really interested me so I'm hoping they have more, and better, perks when they do release
---
What the heck is a jawn, anyway?
---
*send PC to confirm
---
Turn the top one on so you get a waterfall from sink to sink.
---
I had that happen inside a free states bunker.
---
I fast travelled there and it was really cramped and they didn’t practice social distancing
---
Bonds aren't with teams. They're with individual players, so for instance if theres 1 other player in your team you can only get 1 bond. So you wont be able to do bonds solo unfortunately
---
Honestly either the devs never play or the management forces them to do this shit just to save time. Example first run through hey so this is the generic idea but we where thinking to put it on this other thing and change up the options management does it work? Well yeah sorta but we would like to give it some additional tweaking. Oh really on who's tab if it works like we said it would to any degree then put it out you got other shit to work on. 
---
Management can be beautiful when they manage a workforce for quality and ability to move products or updates but can also be the most God forsaken thing there ever was
---
I'm not getting any reward from the weekly ones just finished 3 and nothing. 3k score in the bin
---
Riding shotgun has a guarantee legendary spawn half way through.
---
I have yet to actually use a flamer in 76 lol but they seem like a lot of fun
---
The tesla is nice because as long as you shoot in their general direction you get the tag
---
Yeah, took me all of a minute to figure the clicks involved, the limits, the process, and the lack of Ultracite to determine it is yet another piece of shit they’ve given us.  To the person or group in the meeting that decided this was the way to go, please do a picture search for middle finger.  Stupid stupid Bethesda management.
---
Just around the overseers camp across from the wayward there are plenty of logs
---
5 Gums spawn in the building southside of tyler county fairgrounds in baskets in the trick or treat building.
---
Pretty sure it just takes time. We switched out one friend for another and I watched her bar crank up after just a few minutes. We were set to Event and weren't even doing any
---
Seems okay so far, they estimated about an hour per rank at the beginning but it's no where near that bad. I do appreciate the new range of challenges involved too, hell, with the "Complete 5 events in a team" even the regular ass events had multiple people doing them. I guess it just depends how it scales from here. I do think it has to be accepted though - this is designed to provide extra motivation to play the game over months. This is not designed to be content you bang out over the weekend. That's not to say there isn't going to be room for improvement of course.
---
It actually can affect you. These guns allow people to insta-kill the scorchbeast queen. If you don't immediately get to the area, or can't put enough damage on her before this happens then you lose out on loot and experience.
---
Wow, did not know that about the SMG. It doesn't use both perks in Adventure though does it?
---
I trust Bethesda and religion more than mathematics nerds. They said the season will be free and they never disappoint, never.
---
No, not in adventure. Not sure why tbh. But the Gauss in Adventure does use Explosive
---
That happens to me sometimes too where they're like level 9's. But most of the time they're level 30 or higher
---
It might have randomly unequipped the emote, check in the atom shop :)
---
It’s 5 minutes from when each person joins. 1 bond per person
---
That's super lame. I've run into problems before but I can usually fix it. Moving camp is the last resort, at least you have more experience.
---
Very much so for me.
---
Score is meant to be awarded for public events, seems like it's bugged. You will be getting score for the 0/5 challengss when they hit 3/5, but won't get it again at 5/5. I wonder who tests these updates because those two things would be blatantly obvious.
---
I assume Ward didn't get the memo that he's supposed to be fixed to his location now? Still saw him wandering around complaining about Raiders
---
Is that the 10mm or the Tommy Gun?
---
The more mistakes they make the more I think they have a very lax drug policy at BGS.
---
I think they did it because it’s like moving on to a new story but that’s just what I think
---
My Route: NIR Array - West Tek - Huntersville - Flooded Trainyard - Abandoned Bogtown - Generals Steakhouse - Harpers Ferry - Dyer Chemical - Braxsons Medical - Crevasse Damn - then finish off at Whitesprings.  More legendaries than you will know what to do with
---
&gt;Is it me or is it kinda dumb that public teams can’t build at their teammates camp? 
---
nah, cause then morons will put up some stupid words with letter signs, then the unknowing player gets reported.
---
as far as the team, id say the +4 int is probably the best bonus of all the non event teams, its a constant source of +% exp for kills, so teams can use the bonus to farm mobs for exp
---
big intelligence boost
---
more intelligence = more xp
---
The Thunder Pipe is mine!
---
I only use gun runner which affects pistols, and they both actually make me run faster even though they're labelled rifles
---
Still works fine for me. You out of wood maybe?
---
I wouldnt want to boot people though as its abit rude.
---
And yeah does defeat the purpose. But that's the point of the OP. Getting the challenge done without being forced to team, if you're antisocial
---
It serves the same purpose as the previous challenges, it gives the people who can play this game all day something interesting (?questionably) to do and gives everybody else an incentive to play at least a little bit every day. It's a bit more grindy than I would have liked, but tbh it's not bad. In terms of the rewards, maxing the battle pass puts you at a "deficit" of 3500 atoms as opposed to spending 10 weeks doing every single possible challenge. Realistically it would be less than 3000 because it's unlikely you would have been able to log in every single day and get every single challenge done for 10 weeks straight. 
---
Obviously it's a negative that it removes the choice associated with it, but overall you're getting a lot more for your grind. Even if we ignore the filler like icons/photo frames, there are plenty of decent armor/weapon/PA paints and camp items for the people who like them. Each of those items would have cost 400-1800 atoms individually. If you like two of the PA paints you get, you're already at a net profit compared to the old system by the time you finish the season. Sure it's overall an obvious way to put yet another mind game into trying to get people to buy more atoms, but if their method of getting me to buy things is to throw more free things than usual at me, I'm fine with it
---
Not for me. In or out of a team shows the same buff in the cook stove.
---
It's definitely could use some work, but at least for PC after you either convert/buy ammo the menu selection will stay on the same option u first selected, so you can spam "E" to get the ammo or conversion you need. just need to be careful when u use up all the ammo u are converting since it will go to the next selection.
---
Build up workshops and defend them
---
After every single update The servers start reacting very wonky and unstable for a day and then it starts getting better. 
---
Usually there’s tons of bugs and a couple days later they release a patch for the newest update that will fix most of those bugs. 
---
I don’t recall a single update so far that was every spot on perfect with no bugs. It’s like Bethesda codes the stuff and tests it for like 1 min and says LETS GO NO BUGS IT JUST WORKS WOO. when developers like rockstar take months just on bug fixing even just for content updates
---
Just wait for the patch for now it will prob be a bit buggy there’s prob dupes out there right now that no one knows about.
---
We're building up bonus experience from the intelligence boost.
---
I hadn’t heard that public events were supposed to reward score, that would be helpful indeed
---
Thank you, I need to try this. I felt bad missing out on the combat rifle/minigun skins from those events, now I can hopefully get one to tide me over until I get that dark matter combat rifle paint from seasons
---
It's actually a pain in the ass when you join a team and people on the team all start showing up where you are trying to get stuff done. They keep getting in the way. I won't be using teams again unless absolutely necessary.
---
So, if I never play NW I’m just out of luck? There are still rewards along the way right? It’s not an all or nothing thing, right?
---
8 today still got 2 weeklies left, but I am not getting score for gaining xp or events like stated so seems broken as hell right fingers crossed its patch quickly or were at least given something for wasting all the score we should have accumulated playing.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Selling 12 .45s gets you 30 points.
---
Buying 12 .45s costs you 150 points.
---
What even is this logic. Like, I get it, .45s should cost more than .38s, 5.56 should cost more than .45s, but why the fuck do .45s skyrocket by *500%* in the ten minutes it took to sell them and then buy then back?
---
By that logic, they should be 13 weeks long (13x4=52).
---
This is absolute bullsh*t... So I can’t skip the daily level up or nuclear winter challenges if I’m going to make it to level 100?
---
I hate everything about this new system, it’s not bad enough they replaced our daily atoms with this shite,  but there isn’t enough points to finish it? F*ck everything about this.
---
If your "interaction" with players mean puting punji tables over and over and then just spawn them out of nowere just to take all the things you could carry...well...thats not precisely a "Raider" thing...but an exploit...and someone who takes advantage on those things...HERE AN IN CHINA is the same thing, a fucking shit troll...
---
Now...the pvp in this game was bad from the very begining...why? because there is a lvl 200 taking advantage on a lvl 40...or less...so, for the very least...thats no even close to "fair"...let me se, what else do we have in this game besides a duchebag just taking advantage on exploits??...o yea! the one who basically have MODED weapon that one shot any player...not literaly thanks to caps...but they will do either way...
---
I hate pvprs couse they are nothing but a bunch of cunts who doesnt have the pants to fight someone else on fair circunstances...they use tricks, or take advantage...
---
Theres one of them...the motherfucker came to my camp...kill my cow...shot my stuff with his explosive stupid weapon...and what could a lvl 30 could do against a fucking 200andsomething...NOTHING...
---
I swear to god i will take my revenge...i swear it...and as long as something trows shit into the pvprs face...i will suport it...and i give a fuck about pvpr...they better dead
---
Yeah, that UI man, it needs to change...
---
for sure! i wish you much luck. i got 4 skins so far today over probably 30 matches. i have only played one match ever before today haha
---
You didn't mention the SCORE is meant to be awarded when completing public events, which could also offset the timegate. I believe that's bugged though as many people have reported not receiving it.
---
So, it's not worth picking up the ammo convertor huh?
---
They're delayed no idea when coming now
---
Every single insect
---
Because the decision makers for this game have proven to be mentally unstable again and again.
---
I don't have a trap camp or want one, but my camp is built very high up the side of a cliff (with a staircase) because there are minable resources at the bottom.  A guy stopped by yesterday and I thought he was there to check out my vending machines.  Nope, he pulled out his minigun and started shooting me and my stuff, attempting to provoke me into pvp.  I've been around long enough and knew that although I could take him, he probably had two or three buddies nearby waiting to destroy my camp the moment I confirmed pvp, so I gave him the thumbs-down sign and carried on about my business.  Immediately afterwards, he starts running around and picking the locks on my resource collectors to make himself wanted, all the while shooting up my camp.  I figured, "Fine, you asked for it." and chuckled a little as I swapped servers, knowing that without power armor or a jet pack he was falling to his certain death.
---
Yep. Same thing here after today's update. Can't fast travel  in order to defend the workshop and if I ignore the Event it asks me for caps in order to "participate". Well done Bethesda.
---
Thanks for the feedback.  I was thinking about putting Concentrated Fire, but my hold up was that it would not be as good if I was not using Gun Fu along with it.  This was helpful.
---
Ok that makes sense. I joined a team earlier and noticed I got max bond probably within the first 10 min. But I just made a team and theres only been 1 other person for 30+ min. and I'm still at 1 bond. Thx!
---
Was at a few of this places and no legendaries. I'm having zero luck.
---
They're redoing them as well, I'm hoping we'll have a larger variety of better perks when they do release
---
Admittedly I used nukacrypt for the Bravo code, but I soloed all the rest. I keep pestering my friends to grind out some levels so we can Queen hunt
---
They really hate those two armors.
---
They've removed different variations in the past, forcing it to change in your inventory as well.
---
It's starting to feel like the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
Anyone else have an issue building in team's camps? Am I an idiot?
---
Well, if you're are worried about not completing it, don't. Because im sure they will add some kind of double xp weekend for sure. But its definetely gonna hurt you getting to a nice level soon.
---
The game is so boring right now the developers don’t even play it. Seriously, I always want to play this game, but whenever I play it, I just walk around and basically do nothing. Peak video game experience: zen mode.
---
I thought we knew this game was trolling us from day 1? We just play it because we can’t help ourselves
---
People here do that every time. It's like weaponised enthusiasm and naivety. Until the disaster arrives and explodes in their faces, most people will welcome it with open arms and expect the best, despite how many times the ball gets dropped.
---
If you raise a concern too early it's downvote city, you have to let people be shocked first, which in itself is vaguely disheartening at this point given Bethesda's track record the last few years. And everyone is so excited for One Wasteland.
---
Some fucking spastic.
---
Thanks for this. I was about to waste my atoms on it...
---
Same issue here, I have the free states &amp; hello emotes but lost the original salute.
---
It’s leveraging on how much xp you get. Someone said the Seasons are 11 weeks. If so you can skip almost all NW challenges but you could not skip any others. You’d lose 1,750 score per week or 17,500 by the end. 
---
You can still unlock most levels without that. You earn vastly more through adventure mode than through NW so you’ll get plenty of levels, just maybe not everything
---
I mean, as a decoration, sure.
---
agreed the others were pretty lackluster
---
Ty for the info!!
---
Exactly I'm not trying to state that this is purely bad. More of pve players I feel have now pushed so far that realistically the system now is much worse for them if a high geared pvp player decides to monopolise the workshops.
---
I believe that i read on here that a majority of the players were on console hence the no text.
---
I got downvoted to the threshold just this morning for saying SCORE was monetized exp. points. It feels bittersweet.
---
Only down side to this is when you do it alone you can complete the challenges but you dont get the exp boost ( get multiplied by the number of team members)
---
The Iron sights are also super off and the glowing sights dont work.  
---
I assume this is because the gun is using the default iron sights which are about half as tall as the iron sights on the skin
---
Well I discovered that Adrenaline was busticated.  It also seems that someone turned up Bird Bones to 11.  I seem to be floating WAY more than before.  VATS which is usually wonkey seems to have been turned up to 11 also.
---
Yeah I've given up on whitespings. Server jumped several times and either they were all already dead or low level. I'm giving up on this tonight, spent five hours playing and not getting anywhere with this new "content".
---
Does everyone have two Assaultrons spawn or am I just incredibly fucked?
---
I found it easier to see the rewards on this page:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
If you scroll down it lets you filter them by each 10 ranks
---
Chicken Coop is Rank 78
---
Wow that is abysmal. I haven't played for a long time now and this season pass may have brought me back but... I don't think so. Not like i used to play, maybe I'll pop in for a few mins every other week.
---
My CAMP is at max budget...I'm so glad I don't have to build this dissater of a system.😆
---
I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to troubleshoot my voice chat. I press my hotkey and nothing happens 🤷‍♀️
---
Nope, have tons of all needed crafting supplies.
---
They need people who just test the game, like beta testers, but also for not beta. Imagine if they thought these things through before implementing them
---
Ye that's where I first saw it but couldn't fined it in game
---
I've only started playing again after getting rid of my xbone last year and recently buying it again on Steam. I've created my C.a.m.p across from the Billings Homestead like I did before but I can't scavenge any of the logs near my camp, is this intended?
---
T-shirt and slacks, patrolman sunglasses, and the maroon beret. You know why. We all know why. 
---
And for my personal outfit for my mercenary gang, I use the treasure hunter outfit, settler flatcap, black-rimmed sunglasses, blue bandana, and raider backpack.
---
It's because this community is the definition of a battered spouse. They might get upset and go to their mothers after the beating, but they always go back, because Bethesda isn't really all that bad and they love us really and want to give us a wonderful game. *They just make mistakes sometimes.* That's all.
---
The reality is that sensible players left for more fulfilling relationships a long time ago.
---
It also uses the Handmade's default mount for the reflex sights. Which clip through the skin and ejection port.
---
This is correct!  Aside from it looking cool and it having an option where you can spin one of the trays its really worthless.  Its like 3 or 4 clicks to convert 1 set of ammo.  So if you have 30 syringer ammo you are click between 15 and 20 times to covert that 30 rounds (its 6 per round I believe).  The UI feels like someone in the office played No Man's Sky a few years ago and was like "THIS IS AMAZING, WE SHOULD USE THIS."
---
Fair enough :) hope it's there lol or might be bug report time
---
well..on the bright side..
---
fake internet points are fake..
---
They are in the fo1st section. You have to click on them to equip them.
---
Literally just happened to me to. Says it’s complete but no score
---
It's a bug, enjoy the extra rewards while it's happening
---
meh.. fake internet points are fake.. anyone who doesnt know that is in for a world of hurt.. lol
---
i just thought it was funny
---
I hope it is lol. That was prob one of the things I was most looking forward too lol. Beside the converter lol.
---
Very nice
---
It's there.
---
I warn you in advance.  You are heading towards a bucket of hot sadness.
---
No private games, no tent, and box is withdraw only, after sub exp date.
---
New to Fallout First in November, the Ammo Case! Convert all ammo in case to another type with One Click!
---
very laggy
---
That’s just it they just do not show up in the fo1st
---
Kill some insects, animals, and repair weapons.  There's still some challenges on the menu.
---
I do about ten West Tek runs a day for fun but now that I have to do it for experience it sounds draining.
---
Amen brother, nice reply.
---
I know the feeling, I'm dying to get the Fireplace Secret Door but Rank 100 feels so far away
---
Granted I haven't played yet so idk how the system really feels so far
---
are you sure you didnt get it early? count up your score
---
There is sometimes bit if there isn’t, there is one just yet the west of it.
---
Ok thanks lol. I must have overlooked it when I spent 10minutes looking for it. In my defence it was 1am. Lol thnx
---
Anytime!  Hope it worked!
---
Agreed, it's more the implied sentiment behind it, like you are some meanie for upsetting the corporate entity and not trusting that they want to do right by you. It honestly makes me feel slightly ill that people can be so naive, especially two years deep into the shenanigans.
---
Does the standard one?
---
Can i still level up decently just through general XP? Or am i pretty much forced to do challenges which i just don't care about?
---
It's not that hard to level up but I feel once we finish our weekly challenges that will change. I got to rank 7 or 8 tonight
---
That emote was for the tricentennial edition of the game. An older bug gave it to everyone.
---
I'm worried about not getting the score points for the completed ones, is almost 3 score lvl that I will need to grind.
---
I don’t like any progression systems tied to how much I log in and chase dailies/weeklies/monthlies. That’s simply the furthest from what I like to do in a game. Still, I’m human so I’ll naturally feel like I’m “missing out” if I don’t push myself to pursue them. I’ll alternately feel guilty if I buy my way through them. So no real win-win for my play-style other than to try and ignore it as noise.
---
I’m just super happy I’m 90% of the way through the main story missions otherwise I would have never pursued them, or spent the hours I did consuming all of the lore and admiring the impressive amount of small details. I really would have felt like I didn’t have time for any of that. 
---
Don’t like it at all, but it is what it is. It won’t make me uninstall, but may lend towards engaging less and less over time. Sucks, because I think the game supports a pretty damn good community here.
---
I think it's pretty obvious this never hit the PTS, so it never got any testing.  I doubt anyone internally did anything but console command their way through it to make sure the unlocks actually worked.  Also known as the literal bare minimum.  I dunno why I'm even upset.. should have expected this.
---
I know this has been brought up a lot but i’ll say it again, it’s not even like the ammo converter really is good, you have to trade in so much ammo to get like 10 of the ammo you want. It’s like Gamestop made a vending machine for ammo. It had so much potential bur they messed it up, I really hope they make it a little better. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
---
Same here, but the points randomly awarded later while progressing other weeklies.
---
Try working on more weeklies and see if the points suddenly trickle in.
---
Yes it's a bug and I'm trying to run through and get the ghillie suitbefore they realize they messed up. I wonder how far down the rabbit hole these skins go
---
It most likely rewarded you at 3/5. Known bug.
---
I am a bit of a shitbird at times.. 
---
I can dish it out as well as I can take it.. lol
---
You're right that's not bad really, doing the challenges regularly should make it pretty easy to finish it then
---
I expected people to be getting like rank 3 tonight
---
I'm only interested in the Clean Sink, Chicken Coop, and Fireplace Door. The latter two I'm probably not going to ever reach because it would require logging in every single day for the next 10/11 weeks, and still earning hundreds of thousands of XP for the repeatable or spending Atoms.
---
Ah a man of class. Hey, ever heard of something called bitter springs?
---
Definitely a lot more activity at events. Even dead ones. Lots of fun.
---
Good to know I'm not alone, someone accused me of lying about it, said I could've done them before. I mean the screenshot is pretty cut and dry there.
---
Yep. GM isn't dead yet
---
I had something listed in my vending machine for 15 caps that i know i never ever listed. It was in my stash but not anything i wantrd to sell.
---
No actually that doesn’t either
---
I cant even play since I fast traveled to the lode baring area and it made my game crash in an infinite loop
---
Sure
---
I could’ve sworn I bought it from the atomic shop at some point. I haven’t had it for that long.
---
Hi son
---
Alright thank you!
---
Confirmed for me as well on PS4 - can’t see workshop icons on map, can’t see if anyone owns the workshop, when you do own a workshop you cannot fast travel to it.
---
Agree.  It's loading a bit faster and that's a plus.
---
Idk, both?
---
they changed the drop rate?
---
Yw
---
This. The hopeis they will be improved as the initial perks were lackluster.
---
Where do i find what score is on Bethesdas site??
---
Totally agree. For the first time I did the zen event (whatever it's called) and there were like 5 or 7 people there. I wasn't even on a team, I just joined the event because I saw a bunch of dots there already. It felt like a real MMO!
---
Think you've misunderstood this. This is about the new 'Season' system they implemented today in which you rank up from 1 to eventually 100 by doing dailies/challenges and get rewards at every rank. This has nothing to do with player level.
---
hug a bush while you can
---
Gotta love patch day on fallout 76. Never know what’s going to go wrong lol
---
On pc here.
---
Can confirm.  Workshops no longer show resources available.
---
Owned workshops no longer allow fast travel to them.
---
\[edited to show game system\]
---
Why am I all of a sudden fat and unable to do damage?
---
They did mention about a week ago that they were getting delayed, as well as A Colossal Problem quest.
---
Beautiful. I just purchased the flight helmet to wear with the same outfit. I dig it. Lately I’ve been going with the enclave outfit and the deathclaw mask. I image it’s what the nazis saw themselves as when fighting the allied forces. Some kind of super human creature.
---
Old respawn bug caused by Ash piles, I'm starting to think that it will never be fixed
---
hug a bush while you can before they fix it..
---
also.. check the hot and or new tab before you post something like this..
---
Ah dammit Bethesda. All 3 of my toons use Adrenaline to some extent. Hope its a quick hot fix.
---
I always use the desert ranger outfit with my raider half-gas-mask. Makes me feel like I'm playing my character from New Vegas, IF BETHESDA WOULD GIVE ME MY HALF SHAVED HAIRSTYLE 
---
I like this though, mothmen helmets look good with it
---
Does the other fo1st stuff show?
---
Cool story. I got to lvl6 by doing dinner weeklies and dailies in like 2 hrs.
---
So yeah maybe the idea is to get there via dailies/weeklies more than repeatables.  So long as you can hit it before the season ends who cares?
---
Almost as bad as when I’m in a queen &amp; join a random inv to realize he’s stealing all my damage 😂
---
I actually know a guy in QA at bethesda and he does play the game.
---
I have everything else on the menu
---
the bleating minority wins again..
---
I think it's just more incentive when doing dailies this week, it's nice to feel like your ALWAYS progressing, even though it's very minor
---
Ooooh does this mean i get to be a boy today, daddy?
---
This made me laugh out loud. Take my upvote.
---
Thanks for that. Helpful.
---
Back when the game first released, high rad fluids would drop just as much and often as glowing mass and hardened mass. You could get plenty of stable flux to keep a gun stocked without much worry as long as you farmed nukes once or twice a week.   
---
Not sure when, since I took a long break before Wastelanders, but they changed it to where High Rad Fluids drop rarely, so you always have a huge stock of glowing mass and hardened mass but no hrf.   
---
I've been having to get rid of GM and HM because I have so much of it taking up space, and can't craft stable flux because i never get any hrf.
---
Its the first day. Chill. 10k xp isnt all that much and over 10 weeks youll hit it plenty of times just faffin about. I imagine with events itll be a lot easier. I believe meat week is coming back sometime soon and if they do double xp then youll probably get it at least 20+ times and much more if you play in a team.
---
bush wookie it and get rewards?
---
 https://imgur.com/Uhi0aMW
---
But if you look through this you can see very well they are ignoring blaring flaws in systems. It only takes trying to smelt 40 ore to show you some of these downfalls and that's not making you go through 3-4 menu screens constantly into tedium.
---
PSA: fake internet points are fake
---
Aha. Thanks for the info.
---
this was datamined?
---
Problems with retired sailors, everything comes out bad.
---
There are fish in Solomon's pond, and I believe there are some in the river on the west side of the map as well
---
That said, RuneScape made me hate fishing in video games lmao
---
So did I, funnily enough, however if you cared to check the maths people have already done instead of trying to be witty and dismissive you'll see the problem. Doing every daily and every weekly across the entire Season may well not be enough to reach Rank 100, so it's then down to the sole repeatable or purchasing a buttload of Atoms. 
---
400 SCORE is 40,000xp. Forty. Thousand. Experience. For less than half of what Rank 1 cost.
---
Part of the issue thats involved other elements. Wanna craft grenades, chems, ammo etc? Rapidly tap that button! Want to find an item? Scroll to the bottom of vendor and displayed items! Want to go to to radio from stats or vise versa? Scroll through all tabs instead of having the tab cycle like a cellphone screen!
---
Want to go to the bottom of a list? Scroll instead of clicking up to cycle to the bottom! The mechanics are so dated they feel like greedy mobile mechanics that were made for Oblivion.
---
PSA: how many times are you gonna comment to hide in a bush before you realize you AFK a video game just for fun
---
So that explains the brotherhood broadcast that you can find on your pip boy
---
The quest reward (5 cans of stew) give you a nice 5% XP bonus for an hour.   I try to do this every few days for that reason.
---
I would do it.
---
I'm not sure you know what the word "[Intuitive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuitive)" actually means.
---
Your not alone pal. Notifications not showing indeed but you still get credited.
---
-Create a container that only accepts ammo.(Player puts ammo there)
---
-Create a terminal that tells how much ammo there is and where you select what ammo you want (it tells that everything you deposited will be converted in X quantity of the ammo you want)
---
-Create a container where the player picks the ammo
---
Was it that hard?
---
(Yes they could just let people to disassemble ammo but that would be too easy)
---
Xbox
---
Yes text chat would be pretty useless on console... plus we already kind of have it on xbox
---
This is what the atom shop looks like, it dosn't exist  https://imgur.com/iWKggW1
---
They should look at how Dead by Daylight does it. This system is a joke.
---
Same thing on PC. My brother and I just completed the robot one and neither of us got 1000 score points added to what we already have. Or is there something to this they're not telling us? 🤔
---
Wtf
---
Mans it’s the BUGS, man. The BUGS.
---
SCORE is meant to be awarded for public events in the same way treasury notes are.
---
&gt;Its the first day. Chill.
---
I'm sure you'll be saying that when you are still forty/fifty ranks off the end when time runs out?
---
Play in a team for added bonus. Completing scorched earth was adding over 3k xp just for completion not including the xp from the kills
---
People will argue that it doesn't require you to earn the windmill plan lol
---
Here's this time grindy solution, you mean. I don't think the devs are allowed to add anything to this game unless it artificially drags out play time.
---
Needz fishing!
---
I figured it out what happens is they wanted to not be more profitable or faster than any other way it's just their I'm specially good when you're low level but you can't profit from it and fuck up the economy like everybody's doing with these high-level farking merchant build. Make a new character in play the game if you don't mind could suck a duck
---
Yikes. They're really shoving this game into the ground, huh. Damn. Just when i thought it was turning around.
---
It does fall into the map.
---
Runescape had agreeably the worst fishing, but if it were like Far Cry 5 or even basic methods like Terraria or Animal crossing it would be better than hoping I find a squirrel around.
---
We've seen fish along the way, and there's no way someone pulled up a haul, died and became a skeleton just before we got there.  
---
They'd be the same as basically any other meat we find: radioactive, but better for you if cooked.  
---
And yeah, I'd be totally game for a fishing mechanic. Lean back, set the line, put on the radio and just breathe for a while.
---
I think I was picking up 1k for SBQ.
---
Imho you're better off priming it and making the prime ammo for it. Higher yield of ammo per resource, plus bonuses from ammosmith and super duper.
---
The "A " team helped,  but this isnt really Betheada Marylands game. Theyve always been on starfield or ES6.
---
This still happens!
---
it's also missing on alternate characters  https://imgur.com/undefined
---
You're the first person I've seen that's said they got any at all from public events. But that is anpretty decent amount.
---
yeah, at least there's that. I appreciate your help and time though! Thank you! 😊
---
Brother you might not want to consider missing some digital rewards for a vacation as “screwed”. I’ll use my fallout 1st atoms to buy levels if I want. But who knows
---
Exactly! I love sitting on my porch in my base thats located in the mountains. Fishing would add so much more realism.
---
Hey Brian! Messaging you directly, but I would love to feature this on an upcoming show. Extremely well done!
---
Thank you so much for this thorough, understandable, and helpful instruction! This is great. I had the same problem over WiFi with a mesh network set up over the whole house. No other device in the house has issues like this. At first I thought it was client server instability, but I doubt it now. 
---
I honestly think it is the way Comcast Xfinity sets up their routers, because I have had similar issues with Comcast on PS3. Comcast issues their own routers to customers (I dont know if they are proprietary, but I wouldn't be surprised), and their routers have some configuration that messes with consoles. The way the Comcast rep explained it to me (back in 2010, so ten years have passed), is that the router firewall basically thinks the console is a foreign device that shouldn't be connected so it shuts it out, and basically you need to force the router to identify the console as part of the network through port forwarding (if this sounds idiotic, that gives you an idea of my technological ability).
---
Adding content that takes way longer to complete than is actually fun is like the bulk of the non-story content in this game.
---
Or not even spoilt meat - just random offcuts of meat. I don't mind eating dog food, but I want it fresh! I don't know how realistic it would be to have a home-cannery though - is that something that people do? Is that a way to preserve food so that it doesn't spoil (with salt?)?
---
Are you blaming the devs for not hiring a QA Team? Like Idk if thats their job.
---
Something nice and simple I could get behind :) I've been looking for a cheap copy of far cry 5 lol but I think everyone that got it must love it cuz I never see any lmao
---
I think it is a bug. Get them while you can
---
Hmm... At first I was like "Well, this ain't so bad. What's everyone complaining about?"🤷
---
Then I finished converting and tried to exit...
---
"Ohhhhhhh" 🤦
---
Had Beckett show up and kill a bear near me two days ago.
---
Why is this game still worse than New Vegas when it comes to ammo systems.
---
Honestly sounds about right. Hope you get it set up and it helps out in the end.
---
thanks for the info
---
Thanks, friend. Really appreciate your help. If fo76 ever supports crossplay, I'll add you.
---
&gt; Im done and wont be coming back
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Yeah it's a bug.  I have been playing Nw all night and have gotten 4 old skins.
---
If they dedicated the time and energy into bug fixes and logical implementation that they did into an interactive cash grab board game the community would be a lot happier. At this point I think they are outsourcing a lot of this stuff.
---
I believe it was for sale on the ps4 not too long ago, but I 100% suggest it. Fun as hell!
---
Hold down the back button. Circle or B or [don't know what PC equivalent is].
---
If they do that it might end up being mildly less impossible, but increments of 100 Score when we need hundreds of thousands by the end is still far too much.
---
He still wanders around! So they failed there!
---
Speaking as a lvl 200+, just level 1 Born Survivor is incredibly underrated if you don't have auto stim or life saving armor pieces. Saved my ass many a time before and is perfectly fine at its basic rank.
---
If you have a keyboard that allows macros...... I mean I just made a macar on my keyboard for F1 that was enter 20 times.
---
it's still stupid that I have to spend 15 minutes to convert ammow like this, but at least I don't have to destroy my keyboard Enter key.
---
Someone just replied to a comment of mine saying SBQ gave 1000 SCORE.
---
I was in a public (event xp) team the entire time. The issue is that running through high levels instances is far more efficient than a 10 minute event unless a 'good' one happens. Campfire Tales, for example, doesn't compare to the number of West Tek runs you can do in that time.
---
you’re probably right I made like $3K from RMT on gameflip, only reason i kept the game even downloaded
---
I dunno for sure.. Ill shoot you an update when I am finished 
---
I assume your just quitting the game not reddit..?
---
also.. I didnt mention the bush in this thread.. 
---
-ETA: so far its been 3 times in approximately the last hour or so..
---
I looked on the board as jm almost level 3 on it, there isnt an option to buy ranks with atoms or hard cash on the interface at all
---
Im on pc btw
---
Yeah I'm going to just go for it next time Xbox has a sale, the season pass version comes with far cry 3 as well, I have 2, 4, and primal (which a lot of reviews complained about but I absolutely loved) so I'd have all but new dawn and 1, and I'm sure there's another coming soon enough
---
I think that you probably got it when 3/5 and didnt notice. Then when 5/5 you wont get any cause you already did.
---
I’ve been playing NW allllllll day lmao
---
The legendary perks and wendigo colossus event was supposed to be added this update but were delayed based on player feedback.
---
Here's hoping. Higher tier events giving decent sums would soften the blow.
---
Lol ok buddy. I highly doubt thatll be the case tho bc just doing dailies/weeklies get you to high 90s but by all means keep whining about a system that gets you most of the way there by doing easy as cake challenges you cud knock out in under an hr each day.
---
Such an easy fix. This is what we need, not some random machine to add to my build limit.
---
At this point I think they are just outsourcing a lot of the work on this game.
---
Also want to add that they weigh nothing until opened so store them for later if you've already done the challenge!
---
But don't worry, you can spend atoms to go up.. oh but you don't get atoms as a reward as often anymore... OH BUT YOU CAN BUY THEM!
---
see, problem solved
---
If u ever get ant meat, I can make for u...u start the biv quest at the university...read the poster at the tattoo parlour
---
Not everyone has no life and can log in every day 'pal'.
---
On PC NW is dead, how the fuck am I meant to even play it if I wanted too?
---
Sadly the meat and potatoes were held back due to poor reception and to be 'fixed'
---
I agree with you about exploits being bad. But separate pvp from the exploits and glitches. I advocate not for what you described. I just want less focus on making this into a board game and more of a rpg with substance and freedom to utilize stuff in the game without it being gimped before addressing the real issues within the games code. 
---
If they loaded the environments first and loaded the character last for example properly that would resolve a lot of issues. The problems come from how they put the code together. Half of it contradicts the other half or agrees with it in a way that alters something else... 
---
Fallout first members should have a voice what the subscription goes towards when implementing fixes to the game. What are we paying for if you are slowly transforming the game into a version you can eventually play on a mobile device?
---
I just answered my question. All these fixes and changes are to prepare 76 to survive off of consoles and hang on lower performing devices like tablets or phones. The model resembles mobile gaming too much to be a coincidence.
---
/s?
---
Don't be a clown.   
---
Lets start with 'fix it'.
---
Try un in stalling the game and play something that’s actually worth your time bro
---
Probably something to do with the Cannibal couldn't eat a Clown joke
---
Allow us to super charge our turrets into higher levels or something. Bulk plasma grenades or plasmatic molotav, over pressurized plasma grenades that are just basically a step up. Plasma slugs for shotguns etc
---
This is a great bug but is there a way to block people from joining my group because I definitely don’t want to play with other people.
---
This is genius and I love your design. Well done!
---
Lol an hr a day is hardly a “no lifer” and if thats too much for u than ya, i dont think u should be able to get all the rewards ‘mate’. Tuff.
---
They are still negotiating a price for IGN to give it a 8.0 review score.
---
So do you get the reward everytime you level or only when you complete the daily challenge?
---
However a good old tip is to drink and then spam collect while the animation runs. Lets you collect a lot of water. This actually means the well is very fast at collecting water as the animation is soooo long.
---
I had the same issues a week or so ago. Lingered around the last SBQ event after it was done and got the XP and drops from the SBQ suuuper late, took almost a whole 5 minutes. As if i had just now completed it. I assumed it was just seriously bad server lag so i stay a while longer and kill scorched while i wait. This seems to have worked for me. Maaaybe thats going on for you aswell? Not honestly sure though. 
---
Although i have heard of having to do a certain amount of damage for it to drop anything. But if you already have Gauss weapons id assume youre putting in a decent amount of damage to the SBQ, especially a bloodied build.
---
How much xp did it take?  I missed those
---
Lol yep I also missed it. Killing robots and building stuff in my camp both rewarded nothing
---
Thank you! Yeah I’m really starting to dig it. Glad to see more love for the desert ranger armor. Seems like all the folks in NW can’t stand any type of ranger armor. Hope you get that half shaven haircut soon haha!
---
They seemed genuinely shocked that almost nobody wanted to do PVP. This is in spite of PVP being a massive joke where the battle is getting one-shot by a player with OP gear and then vowing to never try it again. 
---
So I definitely agree that they're going to come out genuinely surprised that nobody wants to shift through the same 4 menus several dozen times just to convert ammo.
---
They are becoming self-aware.
---
I missed camp building too, as well as robots. I'll be curious to see if you miss that and if I miss the scavenging one
---
just doesnt make sense how they found time to polish seasons and public teams but not actual content. legendary perks would have added a great bit of content for veteran players to keep working towards.
---
So many "fixes" are actually still broken this patch!
---
Looks great! I’m rocking the Silver Shroud coat with the Marine Tactical Helmet. It kinda looks like Spider-Man Noir. Helmet also looks good on the Desert Armor.
---
I love those moments when you are like "Its not that...oh...damn..."
---
The option to buy ranks with Atoms is being added in like two weeks I believe.
---
That bug has never been fixed afaik
---
Damn I missed the NW reward today as I couldn't find any stimpacks!
---
Yeah.  So I really wonder if they are ever going to add it.
---
Yeah lol just need to make so you throw what you don’t want in and get the points. Everything in the game shows none of the devs actually play the game lol.
---
Why I used the word “roughly” up there if you happened to catch it 🤪
---
Both the robot and CAMP building challenges award SCORE at 3/5
---
Known bug, just roll with it
---
If I could give gold, I would for this
---
adrenaline is fucked too.. could  that be contributing also?
---
Public events (!) are meant to.
---
Shady tactics to make you pay for atoms. Guess I HAVE to save my fallout 1st atoms to make up the difference when we can use those. So even my 1st subscription doesn't even get me the stuff I want anymore. GG.
---
The option to use atoms to unlock a rank is available after two weeks into the season.
---
This guy hasn’t gotten the ammo converter yet lol
---
It gets us no worse off, and maybe better off in the future.  Probably not, but maybe.  Why not take the chance, when it costs us nothing?
---
Public Teams don't give the ability to build in / modify team mates camps
---
There is absolutely no part of me or my experience playing this game since beta that believes this team is capable of implementing fishing into the game with this engine. Unless it’s magically grab them out of the water like Skyrim or a black box pop up.
---
I currently cant even use VATs for some reason.. i think VATs got fucked up with the new patch for some people. Not too sure yet though.
---
You can do the same thing on console. I was expecting something horrible from what everyone said but it wasn’t thaaat bad. Just exchange, back, exchange, back, etc until you’ve exchanged it all
---
Is it wrong to just pick up all ammo?  Yes I have dumping sessions but I find it really profitable to sell .45, etc to players as well as hoarding ammo knowing the converter was coming.   
---
I need to get my 2mm somehow.
---
I'm not a bloodied/junkies. I actually run Vanguard full Heath with a VATs crit setup.
---
Escape
---
Thank you.
---
Agreed.
---
There's too many sub menus on this terminal for its use to actually be worth the hassle. The terminal's screen animations doesn't help much either.
---
Or daughter
---
So can these team people go to my camp and mess with it?
---
Played on an event team but kept checking to see if anyone was near my camp as read alot about regular team people doing bad stuff
---
It does seem to be a huge ask, given how simple items as the Ammo Converter were bungled. But you never know!
---
Actually your my biological dog chid
---
I wonder if it’s a bug OR what will happen is next week xp is no longer a weekly repeatable and instead it’s public events.
---
Bethesda was probably way further along with public teams and seasons that's why they finished those two features and delayed the other two. I do agree to an extent and i think seasons would be better received if it had some content tied too it. And honestly playing devil's advocate here seasons was a higher priority because stuff like legendary perks and colossus event don't generate money like reduced ATOM rewards and time-sensitive grind with a pay to advance option (coming in 2 weeks).
---
Yikes
---
That sounds obscene
---
not adrenal reaction the mutation.. adrenaline the perk card I mean.. which I am assuming you do not run then
---
Adrenaline is an agility perk that increases your damage output as you kill enemies, yielding a 30 second buff per kill, withbscaling effects up to a point.
---
Currently, it is bugged and does nothing.
---
I believe you are thinking of adrenal reaction, which I have heard no issues with, and I am sure that we would here almost immediately from all the bloodies.
---
I'd probably fish off my front awning, as I'm built into a river in the Bog.
---
Assuming the Cultist neighbours who recently moved in don't make trouble!
---
It would add an interesting form of relation to a game that just randomly kind of generates that peaceful awe when you catch the right sun or just get a scene that's really picturesque.
---
My guess is it’s easier for them to do this and more profitable to put it out before game content.
---
It’s just a decoration now lol
---
Try these steps in order until something works:
---
1) If in a private server log into a public server and try. 
---
2) Try a total restart of your system re-logging into the game from scratch then try. 
---
3) Put all fusion cores in your stash box. Deplete what’s left of the one powering your armor, should spit you out.
---
4) Press F.
---
Honestly i only have 2 things i dislike about it. One, ofcourse, the UI. And two, the conversions. I feel like it should give you a tad bit more for every stack you convert. But thats just me.
---
East short term fix, just make it convert *alot* more at a time.
---
They say the last man that tried to contain Ward 
---
disappeared...mysteriously...
---
Honestly. You are a perfect example of the beaten spouse mentality that happens here. The idea that you can't conceive of being unable to log in for periods across the season is honestly a little concerning.
---
There needs to be change to this, someone needs to raise awareness.  BP should not be borderline impossible.
---
I just want to be able to break ammo down back to its components on a workbench (with a small amount of loss which would be understandable).  You can't tell me I can craft an entire rifle on a bench out of wood and steel but I can't knock the lead out of the end of a 308 round and make a different caliber.  Somehow this requires a terminal whereas scrapping or crafting an entire suit of armor can be done on a bench; this just boggles my mind.
---
Ghouls because of the rads at this point. Used to be assaultrons before I started taking advantage of auto stim effects and crippling their legs.
---
No you can join any team that’s public and has room
---
And why is there no option for "take all" of a certain ammo type?
---
You still got the score it unlocked after 3 instead of 5.
---
First thoughts in an hour of gameplay.... They made the game easier and I don’t see anything I want in all the levels except maybe the secret service Guilie armor
---
Can you add to the list: operative under armor clips through treasure hunter outfit.  
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/394evJg](https://imgur.com/gallery/394evJg)
---
No I only run Adrenaline perk, sorry for the confusion.
---
I killed at least one of all robot types. Only got credit for 2 out of 5. 
---
Also, what does build up a camp mean? Does that mean add something to your camp or move it? Instructions could be better.
---
I think we’re getting points before the challenge completes. I have complete 7k worth of challenges today from daily and weeklies and I’m at level 7 on the board so it’s adding up right even though I thought the same thing as you
---
A simple addition to the tinker bench that lets us break ammo down back to its components with a slight loss of material would have been enough and honestly significantly more realistic and intuitive. This is the most "Bethesda" solution to a need/request I have ever seen.  I can't tell if this is design laziness, design ignorance, or if there's some convoluted back and reason that has to do with their take on the game economy.  Damn it I really want to like this game but I don't understand why Bethesda treats it like a challenge to see what it will take to drive me away.
---
Kinda poked around a bit.
---
Saw the level 99 prize is a fireplace secret door.
---
Wondering if its possible to get to 99.
---
Made it to 5 in a couple hours tonight but did most of the challenges to get that
---
And some people are already plugging their ears. It's mildly infuriating.
---
I traded in 99 bullets and got back just 1...
---
:(
---
well.. your losing damage there.. because its broken.. so it might not be the instigating then
---
I definitely missed something. Haha. I saw that pop up for weeks and was very confused. Must have been late when I found that location.
---
That’s awesome! Yeah I love the marine armor to death. So much that I needed a good long break from it after fallout 4 haha
---
My experience so far joining teams is that no one has a mic, everyone is dicking around at their camp or just soloing.
---
Great...exactly what I wanted to hear :/
---
I would like to add to this that I've read that dying with no power left can also fix this if all above fails, though I've always been fine after the re logging stage.
---
Huh? How do you make a team if you're alone on a private server...because please tell me...I don't like teaming with randos.
---
Does this count as a "team" for the purposes of the inspirational perk card?
---
I agree with you and I respect your opinion on it. 
---
Who knows they might adjust it in the future possibly.
---
I rechecked my Railway Rifle tonight just to verify what I told you. Adrenaline is broken since the update, but even without that extra 60% damage I was still hitting for 2600+ tonight with a little Gun Fu.  With adrenaline I'd hit for much more.  Base damage on my BE90 is running just over 500 with my build, 271 on the instigating.  Good luck.
---
Just let us break ammo down to its components at a workbench, problem solved no terminal required.  But wait that would not be an opportunity to make a ridiculous new item.  Just updating how an existing bench works is not a good way to push a reward system that you just rolled out.  But even if they had just made an ammo bench which allows you to craft and break down ammo at whatever ratios they think works for their economy would have been a better solution and still could have been giving away as a perk for progression.
---
Because it's a half-assed port of a console game. Bethesda's been doing this for awhile now. It's why so many keys have multiple functions bound to them.
---
Naw, even before kills I am doing significantly less damage. Think I VATs a radtoad for like 300 and was like...WTF.
---
Is it me or 1 of those photo frames had a minutemen fallout guy on it...
---
I'd rather sell my ammo for 1c each and then buy ammo for 1c each
---
I had that happen for the challenges, collecting building materials and a few others.  They completed when I was about 2/3 of the way to actual completion.  Or rather, they didn't show as being fully completed until I actually hit all the objectives, but I got the points early.  I was also tracking all of those challenges, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.
---
I reinstalled works fine now
---
Did they take his stapler then move him to the basement?
---
Ammo converter, should dump ammo you don't want in and either get resources to craft ammo you want or how it sounded. Dump ammo in, each round equals a new currency, that currency then buys ammo from your converter or ammo vendors lol
---
I've killed dozens in the last week with my gauss and had no problems
---
The entire game board and it's rewards are a joke. Most of it can be had by what we already do each day. The skins and paints are lame too. What a waste of an update. I'll be back when BOS  are in game.
---
Or do away with the teriminal and make it like a container
---
You've missed the hundred other posts tonight saying the same thing?
---
Learn from thier mistakes? Thats asking WAY too much. /s
---
Something weird happened where I think I got rewarded for two of the challenges when I got 3/5.
---
Anyone else?
---
Didn’t say it wasn’t just curious why you had that much. Thought maybe you bought it lol
---
There's also 2 inside the building😁
---
&gt;To put it into perspective, you will unlock 10,000 xp by killing about 50 max level super mutants.
---
I've been doing XP runs for awhile now, I did the calculations two weeks ago, where I was making almost 20,000 XP per 5~8 minutes.
---
Each WestTec run.
---
Private servers spawn a few more super mutants.
---
I was getting 704 XP per max level super mutant.
---
This is what I think happened to me. I got a thousand for each at 3.
---
damn really? havent seen it in a while so i figured it was
---
I didn't even look.. Normally I do. This time  I just wanted to rant!
---
Yeah one would hope so. Balancing is definitely a must for a lot of features in the game. Regardless of how irritating this game can be sometimes though, i still lovenit and have a blast playing.
---
As they are classed as Atom Store items most likely not.
---
Unyielding with maxed intelligence right? The higher your int the more xp
---
It's a nerf and a buff. Sure meat and meat products will give you a double buff, but soups and juices will give nothing now. And vice versa.
---
I feel that man. I was so hyped for the converter but it's just suck a pain to use and at such low turn around... But man the sink sure looks great
---
Public teams are awesome. It was great hopping on a team when doing a queen battle and getting extra XP and shared perks. This could really be a game changer if people embrace it. 
---
The season is a more fun way to reward doing the same things over and over. Whether the rewards are worth it will vary from player to player. 
---
The ammo converter is hot trash and Bethesda should be ashamed of it. To take such a low hanging fruit that was much requested and put absolutely zero effort into it. They shouldn't have even bothered. I likely won't be using it again after spending far too long pushing circle and then triangle to convert 6 stupid stringer ammo at a time to points.
---
Noice
---
It doesn't even need power despite being an obviously electrical machine.
---
I don’t see any problem officer
---
That is something else. I didn't receive anything, it was already completed when I first logged into adventure because I logged into NW first. (something that was supposed to be fixed with this update)
---
Really? Huh. Can you ask him about what their idea for the interface was? What went wrong here?
---
I dont believe it was datamined, but personally I've seen numbers all over the place from update to update.  
---
In several runs just before wastelanders (about 20 ish) I would on average net about a quarter as many HRF as GM or HM.  Consistently.   
---
After wastelanders (the first or second week), this number changed a bit, seemming to net me around 50 to 75 percent as much HRF as HM or GM, which is better, but far too broad a range and I only made like 5 runs, so no really conclusive info.
---
I have yet to run any nukes as my supplies are fine for the time being.  So I have no info on current numbers.  But I do recall in the past, June 2019 ish, that I used to find more than I knew what to do with.  But that was too long ago to recall specifics and I took a several month hiatus shortly afterward.
---
I'm at 10 now halfway thru 11
---
Correct, fungus soup +2 INT &amp; tasty squirrel stew +10% EXP
---
Well rested bonus disappears after joining a new server or two, for me.
---
Thank you! I got drunk and forgot how to turn on my Xbox so I couldn’t check.
---
you are a disgrace to Mr. Fuzzy, but i do hope you are aware of the hypocrisy of calling others "carebears" while your own fragility in the face of the game not catering to your every whim is on full display with your post and comments.
---
Are we ever gonna have the eso dev cycle of nonstop improvements over the first few years to absolute popularity.  Like every patch was something positive and was consistent and they never had a smol team stay smol.
---
I don’t understand? A terminal? I thought it converted ammo? Do you have to take tests or something? 
---
Or is it useless? It’s just cosmetic? I’m so lost.
---
Same here, guess we are the lucky few
---
Im not a noob but if you dump a bunch of fusion cores im takin a few jic.
---
Pretty good, havent experienced any bugs beside 2 SCORE challenges *completing* early
---
The new public teams add small benefits that make teams a little more viable and worthwhile. A bunch of bugs are fixed, but never experienced them before so they dont affect me
---
Word around town is there is a new dupe, but it's straight BS, only dupe is on PC with a 3rd party application
---
No, but I did notice that my camp is now being attacked by level 65 bloated ghouls lately. They don't usually spawn in the area that I am at. I did not think it had anything to do with the raider punk that I have with me. I used to only get attacked by low-level mole rats. You're lucky that you get aliens
---
gotcha, if that's the case then its an obvious ploy to get people to pay for the last bunch of ranks once they become super expensive.  if so I'll just decide not to care about the new system.
---
There's a lot wrong with the game before this new seasons thing, so yeah it's a shame all we get is more and more grind and scant new actual content.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/gsbMU
---
It gets broken lol. When you doubled unyielding you could get some fantastic numbers
---
So basically you're saying for even a regular play of this game, it'd nigh on impossible for them to get to Rank 100 without paying something to cover the gap?
---
Even worse for people who are mostly solo players or don't ever engage with NW?
---
That's pretty fucking predatory if that's the case. It's not enough that rep grind and bullion grind are overbearing as it it. Now add this to the equation too.
---
Excuse me? I’m sorry I don’t mean to be rude but I legitimately don’t understand what you just said.
---
I know your pain very well and same here I will have faith in this game forever!
---
Has anyone mentioned how horrible it is to use the ammo converter yet? A terminal? Really? It’s gonna take you the whole season to trade it unused/unwanted ammo.
---
You can triple it aha
---
I can't wait till double XP comes back lol
---
Ye because the people who are complaining about how tedious and not worth it the pass is were **definitely** doing every single one of their dailies and weeklys which requires you to skin a dragon whilst wearing a clown outfit, blindfolded whilst covered in unicorn shit... 
---
 
---
It’s 2000 atoms if you complete the pass and you get cosmetics too. The reward payout isn’t as bad as people make out.
---
*Perspective*
---
This game is a monkey paw situation.
---
That sucks
---
This should be the default assault rifle look and not the elephant dong looking thing...
---
We all do m8, this thing is crap shit.
---
Im dead LOL
---
I seem to have slightly longer load times on my X, but I might just need to restart my console.
---
No crashes and events pop up, so far so good.
---
Yeah! I don’t see why people are getting so mad over this. It’s just an option in the game. Just cuz you got yourself so hyped for this thing doesn’t mean you need to trash on it because it’s not meant for you.
---
You just started getting lag and framerate drops?  Lucky you!  Many of us (most of us?) have had that for at least a year.  Which is amazing because no other game I own has that.  The game has shit optimization.  It's like they use some custom pagefile for a cache that fills up and the game lags while there is some cleanup.
---
Honestly I was looking forward to this item the most. I am disappointed.
---
Theres a long delay sometime
---
Dunno why i’m constantly amazed about the amount of complaining on the internet. Nobody has a gun to anybodys head making them play something if they don’t enjoy it. Clearly we all enjoy this game despite some of its imperfections. Like a marriage 🤣.
---
I think its rewarded from the Collossul event, or it will be a atmoic shop item when the event drops somtime in the next couple weekly resets
---
How is the fortnite one way more forgiving that this lol
---
Some one did the math on here and apprently no even if you log on and do every daily and weekly, you will still not hit 99, you would max out at 94.
---
 so unless they give some extra rewards, double score or some other way to gain score, you will need to spend atoms to do it and not miss a day between now and September.
---
Indeed.
---
&gt; I think it's pretty obvious this never hit the PTS, so it never got any testing. 
---
This seems intentional. Especially given the generally negative response to the system and especially the ammo converter. Get their money maker out untested cause who the fuck cares so long as it makes money. 
---
If it was released to the PTS with enough time for people to test it, there would have been a massive backlash to push Bethesda to fix it before launch. Now they have a few months until the next season rather than a few weeks to work on the next one to "listen to and respond to player feedback".
---
Once again, who the hell cares because they're making money all the same.
---
I haven't really wanted to buy anything in the Atom Shop for months, so not an issue for me.
---
If you want an annoying camp just build a bunch of sirens behind walls so no one can turn them off. I hooked one up to the switch that turns on my rad shower so anyone who uses it gets a surprise. :P
---
I run herbivore too.  I'll have to test this.  I've been eating brain fungus soup for intelligence, it does still work.  Personally I think it would be a dick move if they removed the special perks from all meat for herbivores.  I can understand not allowing it to give us food, but geez.
---
Adrenal Reaction is broken, maybe this is just broken too.
---
Yes it still clips a bit
---
All the nuke zones I've done in months only yield a few high rad fluids l.
---
I thought part of the problem was when you fight the queen outside of the nuke zone they don't drop any of the masses or anything.  However even in other locations the fluids just don't drop.
---
Huh okay. hopefully it hits the next time I log in
---
Thanks! I noticed it says in your CAMP workshop to find the plans which is interesting since so many others are atomic shop items?
---
You can put the clean sink right next to your broken, dirty toilet lol.
---
Yeah. Public teams promises to be one of the best additions to the game. And taking the risk out of it by fixing the PvP and base editing aspects of teams was the right choice, otherwise it would be DOA. Now there is no reason to not use them. And they work really well. 
---
But the bugs are awful and considering we didn't see this type of outcry on the PTS, they are likely because of the seasons. And the ammo converter is a slap in the face to players. I really hope Bethesda can put some development dollars behind this game because this is the worst it's been in a long time and after starting on the right foot for Wastelanders this is a huge misstep.
---
Has anyone had any VTU stuff unlock? 
---
I have gotten the wreath through snowflakes paint so far in the christmas items and Bats through Jack 'o' lantern combat rifle from the Halloween.
---
No VTU and I already had all the Ghillie suit unlocked.
---
I think I have carpal tunnel now... or dislocated my thumb from rapid clicking...
---
Can we harass them until they make it so it has a slider like a vendor or is a workbench?
---
Yeah, and when we complained about not being able to earn atoms din a daily basic people came to defend Bethesda like they were White Knights saying "OH BUT BETHESDA SAID WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EARN SCORE JUST BY PLAYING NORMALLY"...
---
Beaten spouse mentality? Lol what r u on about? If i dont login, i dont login, aint the end of the world. Besides, if i think the end rewards r of enough value to me then all the atom you make up until then in the season id just use to get there. I can fully see missing a few days here and there and still making the 90s and once youve made it that far buying ranks with atom has more value since theyre the slowest ranks. And u get 500 for finishing so if its last day and youre like 2-3 away u hav no reason not to if theres no other way. I think youre blowing this whole “theres not enough score chances for non daily players to reach the end” nonsense completely out of proportions. 
---
Bethesda needs daily logins, its important to show higher ups the game has a healthy and sustainable playerbase. The game also needs a steady influx of microtransactions to fund additional content and pay the overhead on keeping the game alive. This system addresses both. The previous ‘challenges for atoms’ system was too generous (its true, you can hate all you want) ppl were setting on thousands of atoms and never needed to buy any but for those that didnt hoard atom from daily/weekly challenges there wasnt much to keep them as daily players and theyd just do new content when it came out and then wait till the next one as if it was dlc for a single player game. MMOs dont survive that way. This was NEEDED to keep the game alive, simple as that. If they made it too easy to reach top rank without daily logins it doesnt achieve that goal. A player that plays 24hrs over a weekend once or twice a month does less for the longevity of this game than someone that gets on for an hr or less before bed everyday. Sure its not an easy thing to do for everyone but they gave plenty of avenues for ppl to reach that end goal even if they cant login every day. If i fall short of 100 by the end i will certainly use some atom i hav to reach it. If a season comes where those end rewards are not worth it to me then i wont. Simple.
---
I need the Fireplace Secret Door, it's like the only thing I care about lmao, Rank 100 -.-
---
Edit: Rank 99, such a large difference, I'm totally not going to die from the grind anymore :P
---
So disappointed in the ammo convertor as it stands. However, I spent the time to sell enough .38 ammo to get the max 2000 credits. That will net me just 600 5mm if I recall. The useful thing is, as you can use a convertor in anyone's camp, if we are out and about and one of us is short of ammo, I know I have 2000 credits to spend and can get any ammo that it'll produce. That's kinda handy? Maybe? 🤓
---
Your a madlad. Im gonna steal your idea and out thembehind the doorways next to my vendors
---
Still wish the menus were intuitive and not six(think 3 actual steps removed), seriously who hits escape to go to a new menu??  but this was a problem with grouping before. 
---
AND 
---
we still need text chat - especially for groups.
---
I do this whenever I find a lv 10 or less, hazmat suit, fully upgraded weapon and a bottle of nukashine, every single time a lv 10 or less is on. 
---
Once gave a lv 2 a nukashine and then 2 min latter he was in the bog, best play session in months
---
Just did back on tue beat with like 15 guys... the map was full of camps. For all the shit people are back in the game
---
The gather 10k xp is surprisingly faster than i expected so may not be as screwed as we would expect
---
The menu is clunky and cumbersome, the prices to buy ammo are insanely high.  Fail.  I'd almost just scrap the damn thing.  If I have for example 300 rounds of 10mm, why not just let me cash in the whole thing at once instead of having to slowly bang my way through menus to sell 24 at a time? And then get back 75 rounds of 5.56 for my 5 minutes of effort.  I could get more just running Westek and get XP to boot.  What a turd.
---
[Me too, managed to get in and screenshot it.](https://i.imgur.com/3kMxKqk.jpg)
---
Lmao! Same
---
Holy wall of text, Batman!
---
Agreed, you can just be in a group and doing an event all the way across the map to get credit - very nice.
---
It happens.  It’s happened to me. 
---
Just use the max contractor perk and the camp thing to repair all. 
---
I’ve read you can just move your camp (even a small amount) and if it can be placed then all is rebuilt with no resources.
---
Linings where added, shielded is about 200 bullion, have fun
---
Mine seems like I get awarded before I complete them. The one for building things in ur camp awarded me before I did the last step. But I did get the correct amount.
---
The rifle skin is a definite purchase if i get a good handmade
---
only everyone
---
My bloody unarmed stealth build can hit 30k a swing on the SBQ. Plus i can punch her midair with my secret service jetpack. So much fucking fun 🤣🤣🤣
---
So disappointed in this item.  I was really looking forward to as I'm sure a lot of others were as well.  Guess Bethesda enjoys creating items the community wants and hitting them in the jimmies with them.
---
How about instead of wasting your player's time with the f'king console menu and minuscule conversion amounts,  you allow us to dump as many rounds as we like in the ammo converter side (which appears to do nothing productive), and use the console to select the rounds we want and have it take *n* number of real hours to convert the amount. 
---
As it is now, it's camp decoration.  I'm not going to waste my game time with it.  
---
Legendary reward... pffft.
---
Because the same people who complain the devs don't play the game, obviously haven't played this game much themselves.
---
let me exchange some .38 ammo, a few thousand times....via a terminal... FFS, who designed and implemented this steaming pile of cow dung. 
---
1) Open input bin and transfer junk ammo
---
2) Select desired ammo and press convert
---
3) Open output bin
---
But let me guess, something something something item space, system crash, something something something . Sigh.
---
I didn't crash once today in my play session for the 1st time since Wastelanders.  I'm happy about that.
---
I'd still do them if I was you. I've personally been doing them and I'm only 14k XP away from the final reward (Winter jacket)
---
What about vats? Is it still broke to the point all my vats perks and builds are junk? My main is broken... Missing multiple 50% makes sense, missing all 80-95% shots missing especially when just shooting would have hit is bs.
---
I think a lot has to be the learning curve of the menus took me 2 minutes of fishing to find how to even go to the group. Never joined a group and I'm level 76.
---
Ill have to check. Didnt get a chance to :)
---
Everything's subjective I guess. I think the the new flyboy stuff is at least interesting, with new addition to all the categories of items I listed above.
---
I think you've got to grant objectively at least, that this week isn't disappointing to a lot of people.
---
Disappointing is when they trot out the "Greatest Hits" weeks when they've got stacks in reserve to release. Like the RED ROCKET GARAGE!
---
the circle-jerk in this sub is real. Bethesda has lowered my expectations from them as a company in a way I never though possible with the release of 76, and if I'm being honest some design choices in Fallout 4. I'm also upset they are releasing all of this content for 76 with no intent to back port to Fallout 4, which could be a huge with for the single player community and help Bethesda revenue. Is what it is I guess.
---
As a PSA, if you have a higher end logitech keyboard or mouse(has to be G series for mouse) you can create a macro in like 2 min and it works great. I used macros constantly when I play gw2
---
I've had all of my weeklies with multiple subtasks give me SCORE points after 3/5 completions. So, this was consistent for me across Gather Building Supplies, Destroy Assorted Robots, and Build up a Workshop or CAMP. Everything else, so far, has tracked correctly.
---
I don't use Adrenaline, so something else must be up because I took on 3 scorchbeasts in Abandoned Bog Town. Usually I can wipe them out in a minute or two, but my damage was pathetic tonight and the battle went on for over 10 minutes. Nothing changed with my build, so I don't understand what's up.
---
Yes, I'm on PS4 and I also have very long load times and have been experiencing an exceptional anount of lag
---
No, these teammates can't affect your camp and you would have to start a new private team with them to allow/enable that.
---
Sounds like Bethesda's third attempt to monetise FO76 has failed again. Who wants to drop a few hundred real dollars on Seasons? Lmao
---
You already got the 1000 when building supplies was at 3/5. Its bugged. The 100 probably came from the repeatable xp, just so happened it was at a similar time to hitting 5/5 on building.
---
They are legacy now, if you have them they will stay. You cannot replace them though
---
also i notices that you could complete challenges without doing them all like i killed an assaultron and got the points but didnt have them all done yet
---
Nope, just a box o' junk for you to scrap
---
People brainwashed into thinking this game is worth a damn still?
---
That makes a lot of sense on paper, but if ever implemented, it cause a whole load of legal paperwork. Creation club or adding mod support and simplifying like with fo4 or skyrim would be the easiest and smartest way to do all this without any issues
---
THANK YOU
---
The bones you grab should always have a shovel right next to it.
---
The problem with repair all is even if one structure (radiation archway) doesnt have the resources, i cant do it. If I scrap it, it will take more to rebuild. I only lacked one freaking yellow flux to rebuild. Sucks man. Had to scrap it to save the rest of my camp.
---
We don't even have batch crafting for boiled water, it's unlikely we'll ever get it on an ammo convertor.
---
Interesting, this is worthy of further research.
---
Toight
---
I have a feeling that the game is turning out to be financially nonviable, especially with free content updates meaning they can't charge for 'DLC'. Since year one they have been cutting into Atom rewards, introducing new things to tempt Atom purchases, and the Seasons are just the latest example. Someone high up is pushing them to make more money.
---
Sure, the Seasons are free, but to have any hope of getting to the final rewards you'll likely need to buy Atoms to spend on progression, likely working out more expensive than other games purchased seasons.
---
It's insane, I was disconnected twice within a half hour
---
Yes! This machine is very confusing I don't know the difference between ballistics high and low level ammo
---
Yea it happened to me i went and did some other stuff and was rewarded with it after some time
---
I joined a server just to get discu
---
Holy crap thats a lot of wood bro. You are a true lumberjack.  
---
Good to know that we get the score at 3/5.  I'll cater my gathering of supplies accordingly.
---
The same way you do it on a public one. Social menu &gt; tab over to public teams &gt; create team.
---
Does the amount required increase per level? I'm already about level 10 so I just assumed it was smooth soaring
---
I'm sure it will come back in a few weeks since otherwise new atom shop items has been slim.
---
I'm busy with work most of the time. I must've missed it
---
&gt; I assume your just quitting the game not reddit..?
---
Do any of the butt hurt people who hate this game actually quit reddit? Nope, for some strange reason they never do. They just stick around crying and upvoting each other while everyone else enjoys the game lol.
---
Why, what happened?
---
So far I have earned 7300 nuclear winter xp today and unlocked:
---
Holiday Wreath, Wrapped Presents, Holiday Tree, Wrapped Presents Paint, Snowflakes paint from the Christmas challenges
---
Bats Paint AR, Halloween Paint, Bats Paint Minigun, Jack o Lantern Paint CR
---
Other people have said the xp stacks for them unlocking multiple items at each level. For me it is alternating between the 2 lists going in order.
---
Yeah, seemed like there was a TON of legendary loot tonight, and seemed like the events were popping up a lot more often as well.
---
Ok thanks! I worried I would scrap this and end up finding out later that you need this to build a certain item.
---
It is so fucking bad. What’s with needing to back out seven hundred times after converting a bunch of ammo.
---
Unfortunately not. I've gotten almost all the rewards for Christmas and Halloween (just missing the last Christmas one) and haven't had any VTU stuff
---
&gt; To put it into perspective...
---
Okay... as shit as this system is your "perspective" here is just as shit.
---
You're treating that 875000 exp as something that needs to be grinded out separately in it's entirety rather than as something you're just clearing through while doing other challenges or just playing the game.  
---
Based on a quick googling if you're over level 100 it takes 15880 exp to gain a single level.  That means it would take roughly fifty five levels worth of exp to clear your 875000 requirement.  If the season lasts for ten weeks that is seventy days, meaning that if you're doing the "level up" challenge every day anyway you're already going to have hit your goal for experience with a couple weeks to spare and that's assuming you're only getting one levels worth of exp a day and not any more.
---
You also get stuff from doing some other stuff.
---
Then they need to put more resources and man-power towards this game if they are truly understaffed. This "benefit-of-the-doubt" mindset can only go so far. Bethesda can get more people to work on this game if they tried. 
---
There are no excuses for what Bethesda is doing.
---
I can 1v1 any SB easily as an unarmed build, provided they land.
---
For the SBQ specifically, it's the rads that wreck me more than anything. Even when fighting outside the nuke zone, she seems to spray the area immediately around her with rads every time she lands, and it chews through my healthbar rather quickly (in contrast, the actual damage she does is barely noticeable).  
---
Obviously this 'rad cloud' she has around her affects melee/unarmed builds a lot more than snipers sitting on tents/fences.
---
As you stay in the public team you'll bond with them, and will get a bonus depending on what the team's goal is
---
I spent 10 minutes maxing out the machine, then 5 more buying what I wanted.  In the end, I could have gotten much more just running Westek in 8 minutes.  The only good point is that it gives me somewhere other than the ground to put all those 40mm grenades that the game wants me to have.
---
Correction: you don't get the max exp boost, only +1 INT for a building team, but then +25% exp for events is not so shabby...
---
Then will just have to deal with the crap conversion rates. 3 missiles and 3 mini nukes and it wasnt enough for 20 bullets of 5.56
---
My last 3 SBQ I haven't received anything.
---
Somehow I'm at 975/1000, at rank 2.  So far, I've only seen 100, 250, 500 and 1000 points listed.  How did I end up here?
---
the rewards trigger early.. so when you complete one it looks like you didnt get it.. but I think if you add up your score it should be correct
---
I realized that in the meantime, yes, unfortunately.
---
This was fixed today and Angry Turtle says the lining is +4 Strength, +4 End, and +2 Precep
---
Lol ain’t gonna be no “devs reply” flair on this shit. I have no idea why I play this fuckin game.
---
It took me 45 minutes to get 1500 plasma cartridges. I already had all the scrap ammo and my inventory but it takes ages.
---
I burn through them crafting armor for new players, hahaha
---
Alright thanks for letting me know. I've got 2 Christmas and 2 Halloween left to go then.
---
Not a bug, it's a feature
---
Don't say anything. Bethesda might try to fix it
---
I really want the Chicken Coop and the Fireplace door, but I don't want them enough to commit that hard for two items, and certainly not enough to spend 40 bucks or more to make up for any shortfall if I were to try.
---
An hour a day sounds reasonable, until you get sick, have an internet outage, the servers go down, or any number of life events that can make logging in \*every single day\* difficult to impossible, and the fact that every day missed is Atoms to catch up of which it's harder to earn.
---
I thought a level after 200 was like 10k
---
It gives me a place to wash off all the tears from my disappointment with another reward that shall remain nameless.
---
Really hoping they add more ways to gain SCORE...
---
Even the level 5 mutants near my camp that got shot up by my turrets put out a legendary item. Never seen that before.
---
yeah I think you just need to do 5 of the sub challenges usually
---
I've never had problems with the game until this update. I played for maybe 45 minutes today and then just gave up
---
How long does it take to even start?
---
I have only just joined the game within the last two months. Some if the stuff is pretty cool but I was taking a picture of the item for someone and went to close out when my son started talking to me. &gt;.&lt;
---
🤐
---
I didn’t get any score after a certain point , the only thing actually giving me any is the repeatable. It doesn’t even show the xp bar appear when I do the weeklies
---
That makes sense. They're dragging their reputation through the mud, and now that they're in it so far they couldn't just take 76 offline now. It feels like they got too ambitious, and now it's distracting everyone from the real reason we all loved Bethesda. the detailed worlds, the fun narratives they create to run through, the interesting characters that make the world alive. We didn't mind waiting years for games, as long as we could play those games for years. But 76 seemed like middle ground. So they wouldn't get forgotten while they worked on those games... They sure didn't get forgotten. They went into the negatives. At this point, they would have benefitted from being forgotten.
---
It seems that herbivore isn't getting food buffs from meat anymore.  I haven't verified this though.
---
Which ones you get? =]
---
Yeah I still see it semi-regularly, I'm guessing its something hard-coded or they'd have fixed it by now
---
It likely was a combination of this and minimal development dollars being thrown at it. The logical solution would have been a machine like the ammo generator where you throw some ammo in, pick what type to convert it to, then come back in an hour and pick up your ammo. But if they couldn't figure out how to not make it succeptable to duping, they would have to make a custom UI for it. Since it was a free item meant to get people to do the seasons, they decided it wasn't worth putting any money into and just went with an annoying terminal.
---
Oh I forgot, you don't see your own bar so as long as it says you're getting 100% bonus you're good to go. Can't bond with yourself. The bar is your bond with the other players
---
They're really leinent about refunding Atoms. Usually they even let you keep the purchase too. Just send a ticket in.
---
Was happening to me earlier, playing on PS4, and every time the match ended we had to reform our team.
---
There is a few bugs out there that are rather annoying. But what else is new with a new patch dropping? Its to be expexted. Only bug ive gotten is a VATs bug. Other than that its good IMO. Seems to be a lot more legendary spawns amd drops. But that might just be good rng for me.
---
The ammo coverter was a big dissapointment.
---
Yeah def noticed an increase in legendaries today. I like it
---
I think this is it.  My railway went from 4k headshots to 2500.

Now I can get 15 2mm rounds.
---
I already did that. Thank you :) I still think it needs to be more than one click to buy. A prompt to make sure we really wanna buy the item.
---
I found as a solo player, public teams an interesting addition. I started a team. Building, the one that increases intelligence. Bonded with two players.  
---
Intelligence jumped to over 26. It help me to receive loads of XP just doing anything from cooking, bulking, kills and events. I think if you want the boost of XP. Building teams plus food/drinks is the way to go.
---
That's actually why I want more of them! Fortunately there is that travelling merchant that sells that bulk ammo box that contains a bunch of rare stuff including ballistic fiber. I buy that when he comes around. Ofcourse consuming a grape mentats first, boost that Charisma n all. Coz woof, that thing is nearly 500 caps O_o
---
Probably some anti griefing measure or something stupid lol
---
It takes months if you have over a million of .50 or 5mm.
---
I’ve been playing and just got the ammo converter and oh boy it sucks
---
I didn't know brain fungus soup gave Intelligence too geuss I'll use that.
---
I'm pretty sure I got something like 2k score for a perfect Radiation Rumble.
---
At least the same category stays selected to speed up the process.
---
*I* sure am...
---
To be honest, he's not wrong about how tedious the ammo conversion process is. If I had to guess, this was the original the method, but they didn't have enough time to come up with a more efficient way for us to convert ammo. So they had to go with the functioning but slow method.
---
Equip Pharma Farmer so you can get extra meds out of every crate and spawn yourself in proximity to as many consoles as possible to request aid packages.  I got six stimpaks before the first ring even started moving and then had to wait for it to come and kill me.
---
oh.. I dunno then..
---
I thought it might be what everyones been posting about all day.. this sounds different then
---
I would def use radshield. Getting close to the SBQ, you take on rads pretty quick
---
Yep this is what happened to me, didn’t receive 1000 SCORE for the camp weekly but went to do Radiation Rumble and levelled up in there and got 2000 SCORE instead of the 1000 for levelling up. It saved me from having to do that math lol.
---
If you can get her to land, absolutely. I run underneath her when she’s flying and it often works. Not always though. If you’re thinking about it, you’re probably ready to try.
---
Yeah actually I’m not sure about VTU stuff but I just unlocked Halloween skins and Christmas stuff didn’t really get a good look at it tho saw a 10mm skin definitely for Halloween
---
I was looking forward to that too! What the heck!
---
I'm rushing through them as fast as I can. Almost 14k in 6 hours was damaging lmao
---
Imagine still trying to justify paying for sellout first.... the devs obviously don’t play or don’t care about this game.
---
go hug a bush yo.. before they patch that shit out
---
Thanks!
---
It was a team of 3 with similar names, and they also went and broke a bunch of shit at my wife's house somehow. It was a very frustrating evening.
---
How do you know they’re junkies? 😱
---
Chem or grocer backpack, deep pockets on all armor pieces, bear arms and bandolier and all the carry weight armor pieces and +1str pieces you can find. A lot of the weight reduction perks aren't worth the perk points, you're better off focusing on gear.
---
Was just doing that:)
---
Honestly, I expected it to suck.  After seeing the legendary perk system, I thought this is Bethesda's approach to all the new and upcoming systems: an excruciating, back breaking grind for minimal reward.  Actually that has already been like that to a degree.  To me the ammo converter is just the newest manifestation of a horrible, yet very well established pattern.
---
Noticed when I put perforating mag on i do more damage to sbq with my gauss
---
I’m having this issue too
---
I feel like it might be intended change because all non meat foods have almost double or more boost like cranberry relish was 10% now it says 25% xp.
---
Without reading, I'm going to guess that that's the materials bug.
---
Edit: And it was, shocker.
---
right on brother
---
.
---
or sister.. or something neutral as the case may be..
---
You will miss out on 1 lot of daily’s which is like 2 levels if you do them all. The weekly’s give you a level each.
---
Add as many lawn flamingos as you can and FILL all 4 of your vendors with overpriced white wolf fedoras 😁 I'm definitely not trying to do that.... 🤥 80+ fedoras and counting 😁😁
---
It seems that you are still *fishing.*
---
yes you can I'm one, I use pa on the sbq to not bother using radway
---
My theory is seasons was just rewritten code from the nuclear winter challenges with a pretty game board on top. Except in true Bethesda fashion they forgot to remove the nuclear winter part of the code. Expect a patch to fix this very soon.
---
What's even better? Ever since I installed it, my ArmCo ammo generator won't generate .45 ammo. I've switched it over to .556 since and that works but not a single .45 bullet since I put in the converter. I'm still testing to see if it coincides with the .38 ammo I converted to .45.
---
Why is it a problem that the icon changed?
---
My bar jumped two ranks after a perfect Radiation Rumble run, this after doing all the dailies and most of the weeklies already.
---
maybe he is sleeping on all the adrenaline perk cards...
---
What do you need to do to get the rewards.
---
Is it just finishing matches or do you need to earn XP?
---
I am happy with the Christmas stuff but if I manage to get the skeleton outfit before they fix it that would be great.
---
That emote has vanished for me as well.
---
Correction...it’s shows that the devs don’t test anything
---
I’m saving mine to easily complete daily’s. Just a heads up.
---
Come on guys. There was a bunch of other signs they don’t play this game. Like day one always on mics.
---
Omgsh switching weapons via the favorites wheel gives me a 10sec spike lag on Xbox, and a good 5sec stuttering on PC...
---
If this is accurate then I'm terrified.
---
Mine works fine, but I do have occasions where I simply cannot lock onto an enemy even when I am close to them and there are no obstructions between us.
---
I know this is going against the grain and people will downvote me but it just sounds like a smart business plan to me. Don't forget the developers have to make a living making this game.
---
Unless you want to either a) play the game obsessively day in day out b) spend a little bit of money on atoms you are just going to accept the fact you might not unlock absolutely everything.
---
People think they are owed everything in this game if they log in for half an hour a few times a week. The same thing happened with the NW challenges. People wanted all the rewards without having to actually earn them. Everything in life comes with tradeoffs.
---
Loving the ammo machine fuckwits
---
how long usually it takes for bethesda to fix stuff after an update? do wee need to wait another full update like this one?
---
No, it sounds like the fo76 development team
---
When you people pin it on "bethesda" (the entire company) or "todd howard" (he doesn't even work on 76) you're letting the guys in charge of 76 get off scott free.
---
You know, those guys who proudly stood on stage at E3 and said "FUCK YEAH WE'RE DOING A BATTLE ROYALE" as if **anyone** asked for it.
---
Well this make me happy. Thanx everyone for the info
---
Comparing the ammo converter with something worse doesn't suddenly make the ammo converter any better. It's just less worse by comparison.
---
May i remind you of the shitty conversion rate 250 points for 12 308 roumds
---
The glitches. They always win
---
So have had time with it and have a 3 story “L” shape with a dormer. 22 porch sections on the perimeter 2nd and 3rd floors are one leg of the “L” with 2nd being a total loft 3rd partial. Added a balcony off the 3rd too. All benches 3 vendors piano instruments couches dinning table bunch of tables and accessories plus curtains on the many windows. 100k gen with 2 water and a scavenger bot. Still have some room in the budget so porches and curtains didnt destroy it but did make me scrap my stored stuff. Its a substantial building and furnished with workbenches and a ton of other stuff so i will say its not the budget buster I was worried about. I give it a 7/8 thumbs up. The inside posts should not be there and would like to stack the porches new Orleans style or 2nd floor but its worth the grind for atoms overall. Was thinking of making a small western town kind of thing on a road. Few small buildings vendor shop, workshop, jail, saloon and a couple facades for the illusion if i can stretch them out of bounds. Seems all I do is build now and sbq.

Yeah I am trying to crush it out tonight as well on Xbox with a broken controller. Sticks drift like crazy I have to enter photomode to stand still. It has been a trying experience. I may cry when my new controller arrives tomorrow.
---
A free thing has made you quit the game?
---
Jumping on the top comment since I know my reply below is likely to get nuked or ignored.  
---
Their numbers are correct but they're not looking at ANY of this with actual context.  This isn't a massive chunk of EXP you have to grind all on it's own separate of everything else, it's exp you're earning while you're doing all of your other challenges and just generally playing the game.  
---
If you're over level 100 it takes 15880 exp to gain a single level, that means it would take fifty five levels worth of exp over the next ten weeks to totally clear this chunk.  If there's seventy days in this season that means that if you're doing the daily challenge to level up anyway then you're going to already have cleared this with weeks to spare and that's just if you're doing the exact bare minimum of earning a single level and not playing more past that.
---
I would assume a while.. The more we talk about it the better. They decoded to change the legendary perks because it for a lot of negative feedback.
---
This is my experience lately as well.  It drops a comically low amount of the most important components.  Plenty of raw flux, nothing to stabilize it with.
---
xp - hence why most would rather camp since placement is number 1 xp factor
---
Damn now we're gonna need a shovel
---
Ok so you want to last it’s not worth joining and dying really quick right?
---
My Ward was outside his office sitting over the fence kind of floating in air and he’d do his opening line but I couldn’t turn in the quest. Came back a few times within the hour and he was still there. He finally got his act together though.
---
Cheers
---
Bethesda did say you'd find Ward at his desk. Just not that he'd be there as you'd expect him to be.
---
I have almost 30k 45 roumds i dont even use them...  Send help
---
Yeah, u should either camp or just play the game. Kill and time survived is the best way to earn xp
---
HAHA man the damn missing shovel.  I hope one day to find a raider thief carrying one.
---
"Luckily, we put tracking devices on our lost shovels"  Tuning radio beacon ASAP.
---
I hope they change this shit soon, like you I ranted here after 5 mim using that thing, is just bad
---
People are posting like they won't hotfix this yesterday. The community while great typically, has little patience.
---
I got a wreath and it confused the Brahmin pile out of me.
---
Well damn. That was my favorite one!
---
I haven't gotten score points either for the robot one and the building/scrapping. My 2 friends who play this, they got theirs.
---
I can't speak to whether or not it's a bug or intended effect but this is what people are experiencing. Looks like you can't have it both ways now.
---
The quest content they add is good and has been turning the game around.
---
It's the end game they don't know what to do with. They keep fucking it up.
---
nice, ill hafta get a few nw games tonight before they patch it out
---
No, they're not wrong at all. Of course it's an incredibly tedious process but based off how scripting workshop items works in the game, I'm unsure how else they would do it other than terminals.
---
I also agree that some sort of bulk crafting option would be more ideal but for whatever reason they're obviously not willing to do bulk craft because we've wanted that for cooking and chemistry and fermenter and everything else. Maybe time sink, maybe just some other issue in the backend. 
---
The Armco works better since that is based off the workshop production script for manufacturing but the conversion process has to be terminals, a less clunky interface would have been ideal but this definitely feels similar to something relatively hobbled together by a single dev, it just feels functional but unpolished more like something you'd get from a nexus mod than from a final product, even cc.
---
That all being said, this obviously was also not designed with end game 100+ lvl players who have been sitting on 200k 38 for some reason. It's designed for early to mid game players who otherwise are needing to run around looting or scrapping to hopefully craft out a few hundred rounds. For that 15-40 grind this could actually be pretty useful. For a lvl 300, this is marginally better than just dumping the 38 in a paper bag outside the vault entrance.
---
Yeah, it's a shame that all these missiles and mini nukes we've been throwing away are suddenly worth something.
---
I got the same issue, I completed 2 of my weekly challenges and didn't get any score.
---
It does to show that the people who make the decisions don't actually play the game and just don't care about the player experience.
---
One of the daily goals was to do a single event.  That is probably why you got it on one and not the others.  I thought we were supposed to get SCORE from all of them though... ugh.
---
naw.. I made that mistake earlier today.. since its atx stuff it wasnt PTS'd
---
Couldn't agree more
---
You gain some SCORE for doing events
---
Because more people play it and they make way more money so they aren't desperately trying to break even
---
I just think "ignoring" is very much the wrong word in this case, and its more that they are prioritizing other issues, or are working on new content. Just feels sensational to me. Thats obviously an issue but I think it not being fixed as quick as possible means theyre "ignoring it". Some of these things, if fixed, could throw many other systems out of whack, so its not exactly a simple fix. 
---
Im sure other issues can be fixed simply and easily though, they just havent dedicated the time to do so for various reasons. The fact that we've gotten the ammo converter in the first place is super cool - even if it is super tedious and not worth using (mainly) for the folks who play this game a ton and have thousands and thousands of rounds of specific ammo types. 
---
We'll complain (as we've seen on this sub today), itll get remedied, and the game will be better for it. They cant do everything at once. And they also cant stop making *anything* new just to fix a boatload of things anymore. They have a lot of work to do all over the place.

I went to Morgantown station, the poster about the sheepsquatch start the chain of similar quests, but I don't know if this one is part of that, I'll go through them

I never got those since I thought they would be like a storage box like the ice cooler machine you get in game is just storage (unless I didn't know it actually works)
---
i think this is what we're going to get from here on out.  these seasons are just like developer cruise control.  no new tasks for players to complete, just the same sets of hoops, the only variation being the digital tchotchkes
---
I knew that.  I forgot I jumped into a group doing "line in the sand" earlier.  That must be it.  Thank you!
---
I preferred being able to see at a glance which icons are workshops (I'm visually impaired) and which workshops are taken (so I don't bumble into somebody else's and look like a griefer).
---
Is it ATX though? On the datamine wasn't there a separate SCORE section?
---
Surely the can give it a revamp through a hotfix though
---
How do you tripple it? I heard about double stacking but never tripple.
---
I think they can easily make the ammo converter less tedious by adding an option that is 10 times the normal rate. It would still be tedious for people like me with over 1000 syringer syringes, but it will be less of a hassle.

Am i the only one whose **only** problem with the ammo converter is that I can't convert paddle ball string?
---
Wasn't the A team busy with making the new Doom games as good as they are?
---
You have to buy the plans from crater for gold bullion after you get to a certain rep rank
---
Same, I think it looks cool visually as I love 50s aesthetics to begin with and I think it makes a nice addition to Beckett’s bar area but I never actually use it lol
---
This.  Pharmafarmer perk will have you rolling in meds.  Don't forget it even works on already looted crates!
---
I think they're new, or they must have made them a more common find? Today is the first day I've found them as well.
---
I got a guess pistol from mumbles before I learned the plan. Still can't sell either though so I guess its fair
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but the score is shared across characters, right?  Couldn't you just roll some level 1 noob characters and knock out the "level up" challenges easy vs. trying to do it on your level 300 main?
---
I just did my dailies, ran some public events, did all of the minor dailies (looking at you, Jack) and focused on killing as many enemies as possible.  Did what I could to increase my Intelligence and get more XP.  I finished the SCORE daily challenges except the NW one and did about half of the weekly ones.  Ended up unlocking 10 spaces, and went from level 210 to 218 on my alt.   Granted, I played about 6 hours, but I felt like the ranks came pretty quickly when I stopped worrying about it.
---
It would indeed be less tedious but for whatever reason they have decided against any sort of bulk crafting. 
---
You'd have to ask them for whatever legitimate reason they might have for why that is but it's been requested since launch but hey so was ammo conversion and while it's definitely not ideal a year plus later it's at least in the game so hopefully improving it takes less time than creating it.
---
My reward didn't show up at all for that one.
---
100% agree. I now own a fisherman outfit that i really did not want to purchase lol
---
im fairly sure i had bought that. was a damn long time ago but gerr lol
---
This. This exact reason.
---
The first part is note for note the same as the main theme from Tron: Legacy
---
You can have mine.
---
I thought I saw it close to the end of the legendary run board
---
Infuriating is watching some people that aren't bothering to look at this in actual context and are just jumping on the "bethesda sux" bandwagon because of their blind  faith in someone's math.
---
This isn't a chunk of experience you need to spend the next ten weeks mindlessly grinding away at after you've finished all of your other challenges, this is experience you're going to be constantly earning all the while while you're playing the damn game.  Just by doing the daily "level up" challenge you can finish this extra chunk of over 800k exp in fifty five days, even sooner if you're gaining more than a single level every day.
---
complaining has been going on for like 9+ hours.. what are you talking about begin?
---
but i dont care about those solo old games. i will keep playing 76
---
I know... I’m ally with the raiders. I just don’t have them and they dropped
---
Yeah pretty crappy. Just tell me what I need. Not 200 transactions to get 200 bullets.
---
They are gold bullion rewards
---
YUP! You are correct. I simply help my tongue but can no longer.
---
Oh bethesda
---
I still can't see a certain friend on my social menu on PS4. He hasn't started the game up since this update but I don't think that will fix me not being able to see him listed.
---
Same, I was really enjoying the daily sale items they were bringing back around Fasnacht &amp; even up to this last week.
---
I picked up a ton of outfits &amp; camp items I wanted but either didnt think were worth the price or missed out on. 
---
I really want more of the Raider/Settler &amp; Wastelander style outfits to return.
---
happened to me on just about all of them, got the completion when i was half done with the challenge
---
soooo, 'craft all' still not do-able for corn soups, eh?
---
probably meth yo..
---
Ohhhh ok cool
---
I had a similar bug. My problem was it gave me the 1000 SCORE before I had finished all five items on the list. For example, it gave me the 1000 score when I only had 3/5 on Destroy Assorted Robots, and then when I finished the list and got 5/5, it didn't give me anything. Same thing happened on "Build Up A Workshop or CAMP".
---
I love looking at the reddit and seeing 8 posts complaining about the exact same thing. /s
---
It was so small to begin with it didn't even look fun...
---
They should give us something cool like Fallout 4's Sanctuary RR w rooms, not a dinky hut w a garage door.
---
Do you feel like you could level up at a decent pace just playing for XP? Or are you pretty much stuck having to do the challenges?
---
I gave up on Destiny 2 due to it being so focussed on bounties. Challenges don’t sound much different.
---
What platform, I probably have a spare. PS4
---
I want it to tell me how many I have of a type and give me the option to trade as many as possible
---
Haha! This game has become more entertaining just by sheer ridiculousness.
---
Just imagine if it was a later rank reward....
---
I don't know what I did, but I had like 67 INT.
---
Maybe I should try it again...
---
Too real
---
Hangin' pictures on my wall
---
If all you care about is the level up challenge, yes that works.
---
However if you care about reaching the higher ranks you're going to need to be earning a lot of exp anyway so you may as well be doing it on your main.
---
Zetans got him.
---
Your character now has a chosen profession for them!
---
The issue is that now you've done the Weeklies, and as the SCORE points required get higher, you are currently locked into a certain speed of progression by Daily quests. The vast majority of players won't succeed in playing that hour every single day, because life gets in the way. A lot of those that intend to will burn out. In the end it's just another grind to try and push Atom purchases. 150 Atoms a rank adds up pretty fast.
---
I got presents as a reward
---
That's exactly what happened. I was also under the impression we would get score from all events. Seems like that was the point of seasons, to provide incentive for a wider variety of activities. I'm loving the resurgence in participation in events of all kinds. We should at least get like 100 SCORE.
---
You shouldn’t be able to get them...
---
I highly doubt a hotfix but maybe patch 37 will improve it.
---
maybe they just spelled bed wrong?
---
It goes both ways. No more buffs from the opposite food source.
---
Yep had it happen to me since I started playing so about 2 months after launch one of the reasons I don't bother with PA
---
I like the new season stuff. Only issue I have is that I missed 2,000 Score points on completing the weekly tasks. That and a new PA glitch where no matter where you are you can’t leave your PA.
---
Poor guy is never gonna get his 18 hours of sleep in.
---
Also had the weekly bug. Had to do one last weekly to level to 10. Did it and nothing budged. But randomly at times I'm getting one after another so there may be some redundant checking built in. We'll have to see. I have faith.
---
I found some as well.
---
k bye seeya tomorrow!
---
I quit and re-entered the game to fix it. First time it happened during Fasnacht.
---
I have a hard time believing that's the reason considering they let you key in numbers for number pad locks.  And is something that was in multiple previous Fallout games.
---
Hmm...shitpost confirmed.
---
How do you get it ?
---
My camp as well as my character for a new build is all about pre 1900 tech. So now energy weapons or even most grenades, and of course no power armor. So a water wheel for power is very helpful for a vendor as it is quite and does better than a small generator. That being said i did go modern and add 2 water purifiers to use some of the power budget.
---
Weird. Maybe somebody is leaving them in containers? Thats how I found them
---
I did a couple of events including that and didn't get any score from them.
---
I got 10 ranks tonight in about 6 hours, so I'd say that it is likely that you can get 100 pretty easily before the end of the season.  It remains to be seen what kind of roadblocks Bethesda has in store for us though.
---
guided meditation has always been good for legendary mobs.. never understood why it was undervalued in that regard..
---
even the times there is only a couple its still a great event for the sheer amount of mobs it throws at you.. great XP
---
8?  Seems underrated.
---
It feels so empty. I'm hoping they do what they did last week w adding a discounted item each day. 
---
Flyboy is nice, but better on sale. 
---
Also
---
Bring back the Raider and Settler fits 
---
I need that culinary raider
---
I run a restaurant for fuck's sake
---
Although I am a shitposter, this isn’t a shitpost. My meat hook was awesome and I had to retire it. I want to bring it back with the help of the gladiator perks
---
That was my strategy and it seemed to pay off.
---
I noticed high legendary spawns on Guided Meditation prior to the patch.
---
The food buffs are currently broken (in a good way) and give double what they're supposed to, so that is why you're seeing the difference in the pepperoni roll numbers.
---
Luckily, it's not too hard to just run to the Wayward and finish that quest really quick. You may have to also go to the Overseer's camp to do some short errands there, too, but nothing crazy.
---
Although not super thrilled if it's every day...
---
and adrenaline is broken.. also by some reports instigating...
---
I think the pepperoni roll change is part of a stealth buff to the carnivore mutation. Every meat dish with side effects got better. I hope it was on purpose, and they don’t remove it in a patch.
---
I finished more rewards from the weekly and did not get 2 k from the CAMP or the Crafting Materials tasks.
---
I've subbed to division 2 and red dead online Reddits. They complain more. (Well division not so much after latest update)
---
Why oh why didn't they just update the tinkerer's workbench so you could just convert your ammo there...
---
As someone who did 11 Seasons of Fortnite all to level 100 this grind somehow seems worse? Like in Fortnite I missed a bunch of daily challenges and still reached level 100 with a couple weeks to spare usually before the end. This seems like I'll have to do everything religiously and then some to progress. I'm just gonna play normally and see what happens.
---
And here comes Todd’s batty boys downvoting me because they only read the title.
---
you can add. CTD if your character is FT or logging to the purveyor. all my character s are there now. and i can't play any of them. was playing one that was not there, but FT there and now CTD.
---
The patch messed up loot tables among many other things.  Expect bugs like this.  I'd recommend searching this subreddit for "bug list" and sort by last 24 hours.  There's a good thread with many of the bugs that have been found so far listed out.
---
I was gonna explaing to you, but have too many differents modems out there so each one is different, call an I.T friend and say that you need help couse you meseed up your modem and now you are getting 1gb of internet probably he's gonna rise his eyebrow and come over out of curiosity and fix it for you, I did that and works every single time. they are curious creatures and I'm an lazy I.T.
---
So does my wife....
---
Still kinda sucks to have to do every day, though, instead of just playing the game.
---
I mean, sure, I don't HAVE to do it, but that doesn't satisfy my crazy brain.
---
Between the numerous dupes of stackable you’re much better off simply trading for Ultracite ammo on one of the marketplace subs, can easily get thousands of ammo for reasonable rates
---
Take my fake internet point!
---
I hope its not a bug, its pretty logical after all.  As carnivore i get no buffs from herbs and soups, but my meat buffs are doubled. Why dont you complain about getting double buffs from herbs as herbivore then.
---
PC. Damn you Sony!
---
I also could not use them today. Thought somehow I forgot which button triggers it...
---
Debilitating tumors from radiation exposure.
---
assaltron, that red bean makes me cry
---
Hahaha. I appreciate the sentiment. I didn't alter anything on the modem. Apparently it's a known problem with Xfinity router/modems, so I will open ports when I get home from work at 7am
---
"why are you complaining because a certain other game is also awfully tweaked".
---
this is what you are saying. it's ok since in a different game it's the same problem. go use your brain and manage to get a sense of what's common and why so many people are complaining, yet you are one of the few who think this should be ok.
---
welcome to reddit..
---
also.. to be fair.. that is a huge wall of text.. I only read the bold myself...
---
I’m sure there are ways to grind and focus on only specific locations to level up, however, I enjoy exploring the wasteland and choosing where to go. I don’t grind or farm when I play, I play to just enjoy the game. But maybe that will have to change, at least for now until season 2 comes out or I will just bite the bullet and try NW and hope I can at least live long enough to complete those challenges lol.
---
I spent over an hour converting old ammo I don't use into ammo I'll actually use :)
---
I love spending all that time not having fun just to ditch 120 pounds of .38, .308, .44, .45, arrows, bolts, railspikes, harpoons, and then a few pounds of missiles.
---
You in turn have narrowed the context you think it should be viewed in down to microscopic size. I can't speak for everyone, but I play for RP and at a pretty casual pace, sometimes not even logging in for a week at a time, and that was fine before. Unless I actively burn myself out for the cosmetics and camp items, gaining levels I don't even want because I'm happy with my characters, it would be impossible for me to reach even the half-way mark. Further, the sum of xp isn't the issue, the paltry 100 SCORE you get for that 10k is the problem.
---
The fact you label being upset about not being realistically able to finish Seasons, the biggest gameplay addition/incentive added in a long while, being part of the "bethesda sux bandwagon" says enough. I've got over 600 hours in game since year one. I'm pretty far from some hater who just likes to complain. Hell, I was one of the last of a handful of testers on the PTS still putting in bug reports a day before the Patch landed. The fact no one got to test Seasons and the time/progress is pretty telling all by itself.
---
All that said, this post is too early. 90% of the playerbase haven't failed to hit even the half way mark of this Season and aren't burnt out on trying to grinding the 100 SCORE repeatable yet. This community only gets upset when they start feeling issues effecting them personally. If you highlight an issue too early you get downvoted into oblivion. A week later and it can be 1k+ likes.
---
Two words: ammo converter.
---
Ha that’s all you’re really gonna hear about from this patch.
---
I did try to break it down into paragraphs but I’m not exactly a professional at formatting.
---
Edit: ooooooweeeeeee, some of that would make Trump green with envy!
---
I would argue that people posting frantically is what will bring attention to this. It's an intended feature they thought was good enough to release. Our job as a community is to let them know that it is in fact, not.
---
Well, there is always XP to get me extra score and it seemed to come fairly quickly.  If I had to rely on the dailies and weeklies, I'd say it would be nearly impossible to reach max rank in a season.
---
Public teams without text channels and shared experience/looting is a tragedy.
---
Which problem are you having? No new quests given?  Did you check your quests to make sure you don't already have one loaded and it didn't inform you, it will auto reset locations for former raider or vacuum tubes if left inactive and may not allow second quest to load.
---
One question. What is this"10000xp SCORE"? I keep reading about it here but cannot find any official info.
---
Upvoted.
---
&gt;	I miss the days when the meat hook was glitched
---
&gt;I don’t know why they had to fix it 
---
&gt;It makes no sense to fix the glitch •
---
&gt;Please, Bethesda, make the meat hook glitched again
---
O.k.
---
Doubt it'll be a thing.
---
meat hooks were fun
---
The problem is not the us telling them about the issue, it's the way many are going about it, it's gotten childish from some.
---
Bethesda published Doom, they didn't make it. Bethesda couldn't put something like that together if their fucking lives depended on it.
---
The wolf you kill at the end isn't a legendary.
---
I’ve never noticed it before today honestly, I remember when it would just throw super mutants or scorched at you but I barely got more than a legendary or two then but that was also months ago so I haven’t been paying that much attention to it. I’ve definitely never had this much consistency with so many 3 star legendary enemies before though, maybe I was just lucky today.
---
no one uses that
---
Yeah, i played wastelanders for about a week before i was over it
---
Man, that bug with adrenaline is killing me.  I hope they fix that ASAP.
---
100,000 xp for 1000 Score/the equivalent of a single Weekly challenge. That's a whole lot of West Tek runs.
---
I hope this was on purpose as well, I craft pepperoni rolls a lot and this makes them even more worth to grind out the pepper for lol.
---
lol I didn't bother asking for a refund... i figured that i live on the river... i have a fishermen hat in my stash... so its obviously a sign
---
I think its bugged somehow.. ive server hopped a few times, logged out and not gotten on for a bit, just to come back and it still happen. Hopefully i can find out some more info sometime soon. Good thing is it doesnt REALLY break the game or anything. Just a tad annoying.
---
My reputation bar just doesn't move. I can complete quests and get new ones just fine. I haven't gotten any rep for at least a month now from Raiders.  
---
Edit: I talked to Bethesda support back when I first encountered the issue, but they told me it was a new issue (which others had been having for over a month by that point) and that I should submit the bug through feedback, which I did.
---
Definitely can't do it by level up alone, just doesn't reward enough score
---
Crota wasn’t even hard either lmao, you could easily solo it with blade dancer. Those guys were ridiculous.
---
Man. Thats the gigantic, throbbing tip of the iceberg.
---
Dont forget the tedious:
---
Trade 3 Missiles for 70 points.
---
Trade 3 missiles for 70 points.

Come on devs. Prove to us you arent scattered corpses or holotapes, please. 
---
We do enough micromanaging and other tedious crap in this game.
---
It. Just. Works.
---
be awere to open only those listed in the other comment and make sure to put static IP on the ps4 you can do it is usually like 192.168.1(depends on the modem mine for example is 15).x(where x is the number between 0-255 ) and keep one eye on the last digit make sure isn't the same on your PC/tablet/phone etc  if it is the same, change to other.
---
thats not leader of the pack.. that is wolf horde that often procs immediately after you complete LotP but not always..
---
Leader Of The Pack definitely always has 3 legendary mobs.. Ive done it hundreds of times
---
**I was not wondering this.**
---
I'm fairly new, where can I do that? Thanks :)
---
Dang, I might have to re-think my choice of herbivore.  I'd probably be better off going carnivore and eating scorchbeast brains for intelligence.  Wonder if cranberry stuff still boosts XP with carnivore? If not, they need to add something equivalent for carnivores.
---
It's because it is worse, it's just people are high on getting ten ranks on day one because of how front-loaded the SCORE points are, and they had the Weekly rewards. The maths have been done. You can't actually even hit Rank 100 by doing every single Daily/Weekly for 10 Weeks. You'll still have to kill thousands upon thousands of max level enemies or paypig it.
---
Right! I thought i had somehow remapped the button or something.. has yours gone back to normal?
---
The fact that people still play this shitty ass game surprises me.
---
I think it does have something to do with carnivore being buffed then, whether it was intended or not I don’t know but I definitely enjoy the change and I hope it was intentional. I haven’t done guided meditation that frequently before patch so I could be wrong but they definitely were very consistent with spawns today.
---
I'm on rank 8, finished all the daily and weekly challenges in one day to maximize it...now it's just xp grinding which I don't want to do.
---
But my question is how is the evil dude so far ahead? I mean going off of the explanation of what the board game is...we have to beat the evil dude and it looks like he's rank 32 right now. And if he moves over time...how the hell is that going to happen?
---
And they still haven't fixed the bug with Sophia not continuing the recruitment quest after you bring back the flight recorder. Ugh.
---
New item that was added just today that you can unlock at Rank 4 of the new challenge system.
---
Have to be public events if that makes a difference
---
yea.. youre telling me.. I do not run a meta build so I am completely fucked without that card in high level areas
---
I kept getting a bunch randomly when I was doing public events. I didn't correlate these two things together as quickly as I should've.
---
The new challenges are bugged. Just completed two weekly challenges ("kill assorted robots" and "gather building supplies") Both were supposed to give me 1000 points - I received 0 (ZERO).
---
Thanks for nothing. :-|
---
My excess ammo used to go in a bag on the side of the road. I dunno but I'm happy about this... Progress is progress.
---
I can wish in one hand and shit in the other.
---
Was able to get the game to load with a bit of tweaking. I launched the BGS launcher as an admin before I selected Play. Seems there were some missing updates for DirectX that weren't installing properly. Whatever you do don't try to run the Launcher's Help, Diagnostics,  Launcher Repair Tool. For me this one when launched as an admin runs for a bit then hangs the system. Don't Alt-Tab from the very first Fallout 76 screen with the Play, Atomic Shop, etc. choices. For me that also causes the system to hang. Not a good sign to say the least. What's a wastelander to do when the launcher doesn't launch?
---
My uncle's roommate's third cousin's next door neighbor works at Bethesda, and they told me the level 100 reward for season 2 is they mail you a lifelike latex replica of Todd's erect member to suck on.
---
Yeah so people have to rely on a glitch to get maximum efficiency out of a terribly inefficient system. No hate to you - if it works great tip but really they should have just allowed you to select the amount of bullets you want to insert that will yield you the maximum ammo points.
---
BGS prepping for wave two... damnit and I JUST got a new job!
---
Edit: dyslexic
---
Were you doing public events?
---
Perfect! Now you can spend that extra money buying your way to victory!
---
Run through any of the hoard events, including leader of the pack. If none of those are currently available on your world you'll need to go to the White springs golf club, and then run through those shops and houses beside it. I did that and I managed to get all of mine day one.
---
That has happened to me before the update
---
Just go to the steakhouse! Always tons of veggies behind there
---
What happens if you do one of the raider side quests that increase reputation like the raider vs creature or send person to the crater random encounters?
---
I've never finished all the dailies, and today it felt good to do them all, and about 1/3 of the weekly ones too
---
I thought they would share technologies and employees between Bethesda and id, but I have heard that they aren't like that. More than likely all the A team from making Fallout 76 went on to work on Starfield.
---
(repeatedly yells the command word "Ba-Shing!" into mic)
---
doesn't help 
---
/s
---
The reputation bar doesn't change. It pops up, but doesn't move.
---
Or a sadist
---
also, ADS with iron sight does not line up with the reticle. you are looking in the middle of the sight
---
Colonel Gutsies, without a **doubt**.
---
While I disagree with you on that point, I do think that if you own a workshop while in pacifist mode it should instantly give them the workshop instead of instigating combat. That way they're still risk towards taking a workshop if you want to defend it while also allowing you an easy way out if you don't want to fight for it.
---
Good. Then you now get to hear about my ruined roast, steamed clams, Dr. McCoy, and TF2 stuff.
---
And what does the "spin" feature do exactly
---
Oh no I 100% agree, I cannot stand the way they implemented the Ammo Converter it could have been a such a useful addition to the game (now it's an annoying kinda useful one), but I know some people have tens of thousands of ammo and if this can help them out even a little I felt like I should share tbh.
---
**\[ DANGER \]**
---
I was doing all sorts of events including SBQ which people have said gives points and I have no points from any of the events that I completed.
---
I actually forgot about that. That is a good point. It begs the question why they don't make the effort. Really annoying.
---
For real it was my most used emote. Where the hell did it go?
---
What makes you say that? Too hard to implement, too overpowered or just following the theme of not introducing useful items lol
---
Odd. I'm assuming you completed the main quest already so that rules that one out too. 
---
But yeah, that sucks, probably going to require a new character cause I don't see how that would get fixed without some major investigation into how your reputation system is borked
---
I've had the same problem.  Is it supposed to be random?  I mean, I can understand if they don't want you to earn points for every daily or weekly or side mission you complete, but if this is the pace we're going to have for the foreseeable future, I'm not even going to get a quarter of the way through this board and I'm not going to feel very inclined to try.
---
Personally i farm Hawke's Refuge, The Burrows,  Crevasse Dam and some other times i also do Power Up events, most of the time there's 2 to 3 stars legendaries in the plants for me at least.
---
I cant believe Ive never seen that suggestion before..
---
Im sure its come up.. I just never noticed.. thats good...
---
therefore almost certainly will never happen
---
It didn't. I am done for today
---
How much xp do you need to unlock all those?
---
Idk I've played for about an hour and I have gotten 7 rewards
---
Yeah, apparently it's an issue that a lot of people have been having with either Settler or Raider rep, sometimes both, since like April and I've tried everything that people have suggested in various threads. I'd really like to have access to those rewards, but I guess I'm SOL.
---
I wasn't watching that closely I guess, I just know finishing some events definitely gave me points
---
Wait, you’re telling me I can just buy atoms with my mom’s credit card instead of the one that I have myself? Well fuck, this is gonna make my paychecks look better for other things.
---
Monster mash event is a really good spot
---
I dunno about trump.. but reddit is definitely not happy with you.. lol
---
Holy mother of RNG that’s very nice 👍
---
Update:  they've made the game a lot more stable.  Sure it might have been Windows Updates or driver updates, but the problems I was experiencing was only in Fallout and nowhere else.  I haven't had blue screens in game for 3 or 4 months now.
---
The design decision with the pass itself is baffling to me. In practically every other game, you can come back at any point during the season and complete the challenges that you missed. With this pass, it seems like you're forced to play every single day or you'll miss out in the end.
---
That's why they're *Dominators*.
---
I didn't get those either. I'm wondering if it's something to do with being in a menu screen that stops it worked Ng and fails to reward you.
---
It’s a terminal interface. That takes items out/adds to  your inventory and then the terminal shows and increase/decrease of points.
---
Day 1 and I'm Rank 10 without really trying.
---
I'm on the PS4 and I keep getting disconnected from the server from the main game and in the middle of Nuclear Winter matches too. Everything freezes and then I get the blue error screen (and lose my progress too ha ha...). 
---
It must be happening to a lot of PS4 users too because the one guy on his mic in my fifth NW match that froze started angrily screaming "Todd Howard"  over and over again until I got the blue screen of death.
---
Based on the fact that you are making this post, I dare to speculate that your vision and/or you ability to search for things are severely lacking. Both of these are valuable assets, especially when you're trying to find things! I'd definitely start there. Or, you know, the **hundreds** of other posts asking for locations for finding/farming legendary enemies 🤷‍♂️

---
No, it came exclusively with the Tricentennial edition.
---
Fixing it would make sense and not money - Bethesda.
---
I am convinced Bethesda has a CHAD type who's job is to add his own unique flavor of dick move to everything they release to the playerbase.
---
My sense right now is that if you want the rewards from the season pass at a reasonable rate, or if you want a lot of them, you'll have to complete challenges. XP alone doesn't seem able to unlock much (unless you have some OP build and a ton of enemies to farm haha).
---
That said, today's dailies and weeklies are super basic. If you play a typical loop of explore/scavenge/kill, you're likely to complete a lot of the challenges without thinking about it.
---
Probs the first one mostly, a tad of the second, aaaaaand a bit more of the third ;) 
---
I don't see them patching in or offering anything over the lockpick or hacker perks. 
---
If there WAS a change maybe remove the perks all together and sweet spot and word hints are affected solely on the *base* resting Perception and Intelligence rating? Saves the need to change and it's reliant on skill/logic alone with benefits to the special allocation. 
---
But yeah I don't diss your idea I just don't feel it'll become a reality. A shiny skin or food converter, well, hey.... Put three pumpkins in and get a tato...
---
Thank you!!!
---
I dunno.. I assume theyre all full of shit and alt accounts anyway..
---
but hey, I gave it an extra quarter of an hour but it looks like I was only able to get a total of 4 hug a trees out there today..
---
maybe Ill have better luck tomorrow
---
the only reason they would release something so seemingly fundamentally flawed is if they were trying to deter exploits. i loaded in various ammo to get to the cap of 2000 ammo points then bought how ever many .50 rounds that afforded me. immediately went into workshop build mode and deleted the damn thing... not worth it for me to ever go through that again. maybe low levels will find it useful, but i mainly use ultracite ammo anyway.
---
Hoard Events, AWOL armaments, free range
---
Go through west tek. Huntersville, white springs, distand thunder has legendary scorchbeasts a lot. Bounce between different fissure sights for legendary SBs also
---
The secret service armor is regular armor, not power armor. It should be at the armorers bench under “Secret Service”. I think T-65 is the only power armor you can get at Vault 79
---
My bet is soon you will see them very rarely in camps since it is really just wasting camp budget.
---
Look at Challenges in the menu. Atom point challenges have been replaced.
---
You really think it'll take that long? Day one I am already rank 6 or 7. I'd imagine tomorrow I'll hit at least 10.
---
For the plants, can't you just scrap the broken plants which returns both the plant and the fertilizer?
---
Well sure, you can buy your way to the top, instead of work for it.
---
I haven't seen anything about that so far, but if it's meant to be then I'm sure a lot of folks will be happy.
---
hope you didn't buy the whole set thinking it was the t-65
---
I've seen several posts suggesting weeklies are bugged, but I'm not sure how widespread it is. I believe I also saw a Bethesda post saying they're looking into it.
---
I noticed the same! All current weeklies with 5 ranks awarded score after the 3rd one actually. Double checked it every time. After completing said weeklies no additional score had been awarded.
---
It's not designed at all. It's cobbled together horseshit.
---
8 on the top page, I mean. I know there's several more coming in by the minute.
---
public teams yo.. its all the rage these days
---
No, of course they’re not. I just trash talked their game and gave valid reasoning for it. But they give people who do the same thing awards, so yeah. It seems it’s just me they don’t like.
---
Oof. Well hopefully it gets fixed sometime soon. Best of luck friend
---
Damn, here I thought maybe this was the reason fallout 76 had disaster after disaster.
---
There’s only one man who would do such a thing
---
So, the converter remembers where you put it. You can spamclick like you do at water pumps and blitz through it.
---
I did around 10 public events (Queen Nuked 4 times) and did not receive SCORE.
---
Gotta agree.  The Ammo work bench in FO Vegas was easy.  If they had used the same mechanic (break down into gunpowder, steel, and lead - build like a tinker bench) it would have made sense. 
---
FO Vegas is what, 15 years old?  And is smarter?
---
FINALLY someone with **HUGE GUTS!!!!!**
---
I bought it at vualt 79 though
---
for me I'm a hoarder in games so I pick up everything and I do mean everything, so I'm using to lighten my load from all the useless ammo I have but yeah I can see why people would delete it and I don't blame em.
---
FYI, I just used the converter, and it remembers where you put it(I had to adjust once). You can spamclick through the screens and fly through excess ammo.
---
oh for sure, I will prob only keep it while I have room but if something needs to go that's first.
---
But I've tried looking for them and it's all people who are either way into the 200s of levels or people trying to sell me stuff. In low on caps and supplies and I cant find anything good ;-; literally just started the game a few weeks ago.
---
Just as a random aside, the food buffs increase seems to be new (and the math is actually bugged, so let's hope it was intentional)
---
Also, if you're *really* trying to squeeze out XP, look into Herbivore. Brain Fungus Soup will get you +5 INT (w/ Strange in Numbers), but you can also add Cranberry Cobbler which will now (as of Patch 20) be +25% XP across the board.
---
Which hey, I'm pretty happy with but even if intended, they bungled the math slightly. Strange in Numbers is effectively giving Herbivore/Carnivore +50% effectiveness instead of +25%, since it's acting on the *total* food buff.
---
or just treat it like any other trader with the same "currency" system it has. Sell: .50 ball, Buy: shotgun shells. done.
---
Yeah I got a whole bunch today as well, weird thing is I got it from opening perk card packs while waiting in the vault.
---
army of Fasnacht Collectrons in the far distance...
---
i don't think you'd get xp from sbq at that low level. you'd get a little for the event... but you wouldn't have dealt any real damage to queen. level 8, just go to white springs and farm ghouls.. until you're at least level 25.
---
So the game is now a daily grind simulator just like a Corean MMO ? Great.
---
And we can't even just ignore the existence of the battle pass, as now Daily and Weekly challenge does not give us atoms anymore, thank you Bethesda, you did it again.
---
Ok my screen, I still have a full list of Atom point challenges :o
---
There must be a problem.
---
Hmmm
---
Does the jack o lantern combat rifle skin work on the fixer ?
---
I always find this stuff funny. 
---
“*I* can’t do it that way, so anybody else that does is a bad shill whale person!!!”
---
I mean it was but it was so unexpected
---
I don’t think there’s any correlation man lol I think BGS just puts very little thought into things &amp; doesn’t quite understand what it’s fan base wants (look at legendary perks)
---
You should xpost to r/VaultDwellerCouture !
---
Easier to farm gunpowder, lead, and steel .... and craft.  Much easier.  It's one of the dumbest game designs I've seen in 2 decades.
---
Daily and weekly challenges.
---
When you can give out a massive wall of valid criticism they don’t like it.
---
Did you buy the tricentennial edition of the game?
---
Maybe. Might just be in a bad mood. But I’ll put a few caps on the fact that duping had something do do with this.
---
What, so paying real life money isn’t whaling? And I never called you a shill either.
---
generally that's how i am in games too... but just been playing this one a bit too long and can't store any more ammo. i think i have like 30k of 5mm which i was hoping this machine would help me burn through... but honestly i'd rather drop it then go through the menu system trying to get rid of that much.
---
lol I got upvotes for adding to your list of complaints
---
but hey, I just noticed this bit..
---
&gt; Perk card packs. Do you know how completely and utterly useless they are to most of your playerbase? 
---
naw dog.. you got it all wrong.. those are some of the best non currency rewards you can get..
---
you can spend them on legendary perks.. depending on the RNG that could translate quite well upgrading animated perks for max perk coins
---
Honestly I just want the power armor but I’m betting they will sell it later. Cause why wouldn’t they it’s profit for Bethesda they know people will buy it.
---
Just to clarify, have you been getting the *secret service* armor, or the T-65 armor?
---
I hit 10 today. As I’ve pretty much done all the weekly I doubt I’ll be back on there game until next week though with all this xp boost may roll another character
---
You're naive to think the people complaining are dupers. Do you really think a duper or someone who has benefited from a dupe is sitting there switching ammo types?
---
Nah, you can buy it for atoms, just wait 2 weeks. Each level will cost 150 atoms if you want to buy it.
---
Of you play, you get it free or cheaper (you have to buy less levels). Thats all.
---
No, I don’t remember how I got the emote I’ve been using it for a while but now it’s gone
---
Im certain they did it this way because the obvious way was exploitable likely.
---
Under daily and weekly quests there should be quests with a different reward icon
---
Lol the salt is it was max rank
---
Yes it does increase at every level
---
Ticks are terrifying! I HATE them!!
---
I was just excited I know it’s only the first day, I could be completely wrong and I’m sure there’s other people who could do a much better job I just wanted to share lol.
---
if you want XP.. dont carry any junk and go hang with those guys and just try to stay alive.. youll level up quick.. like the SBQ
---
This could be true *if* they add it. But that’s been pushed back some more so at the moment it is indeed useless. And if the legendary perks are gonna be as shitty as they were when they first came out then they remain useless. You know their track record just as well as I do for actually listening to us.
---
I don't have the plans but had floater grenades drop from 3 scorchbeasts today.
---
Aren’t they shutting down the pts? Isn’t that all the hints we need about how they feel about it
---
Funny you mention Guided Meditation, I hadn't done it in forever but did it today because why not. Not a single legendary for me today, usually when I do it the parking lot is a glorious bounty of worthless 1* legendaries.
---
If you bought any armor that says Secret Service, it is regular armor. The power armor is listed under T-65. Secret Service armor is like 750 gb each I think and the power armor is at least 1000 each. So if you paid less than 1000gb you got the regular armor not power armor.
---
It won’t. They’ve said it won’t. They’re counting on people to not want to play for the later-game stuff to just buy atoms to get everything. Instead of spending $15-20 in the store for it, you’re gonna be spending a lot more buying atoms just for that one paint, and then a bunch of extra stuff you didn’t want.
---
Yeah, I doubt dupers are the ones complaining. 
---
Should have wrote that differently.
---
I’m complaining because of the dupers.
---
I tend to deal in witty remarks and shitbirding...
---
Then that’s why. It was explosive to that version of the game, and was given to everybody as a bug.
---
Yeah, with the new changes to the food mutations, I have to rethink my food buffs
---
I could never of imagined the dumpster fire this ammo converter is... how did this get past PTS or was everyone so bent over the legendary perks no one bothered to look this pile of bantha poodoo. No one who plays this game would envision this piece of junk and think my fellow players are going to love this!
---
Considering at the last major exploits I could find involved speed changing some thing to glitch out the server response ya a speedbump UI seems like there fault.
---
Commented this on a post I saw a little ways up it just seems BGS is out of touch with its community. If they’d be more open &amp; give us in-depth videos of how these new features work BEFORE we get them live so we can give feedback &amp; it can be applied it’d result in a lot more happy players. If they showed us in-depth how this thing worked before today we would’ve told them to keep it..
---
I mean if the person is complaining about how long it will take to convert 200k ammo then kinda yeah
---
Maybe I was just really lucky then lol, the other things were definitely new though. Carnivore seems to be buffed and floater grenades spawn on enemies sometimes, I’ve gotten six grenades today and I never bought the plans for them.
---
Yeah that’s pretty terrible. Tbh, this update just made the game that much more easier. I didn’t use one mele perk and had zero trouble doing anything in the hour I played. Barely take any damage as well. I turned it off.
---
I’ve missed out on 2000 weekly ... ☹️
---
You can get them as drops now. No weird glitch or anything just they’re in the loot pool for body drops
---
Ah ok thanks, I actually passed by there on the way to a friends camp but they left before I could get there, but they did give me a power armor frme so that was nice. Cant use it sadly
---
even if there is only one card worth having.. (there was only one shown card I wanted) youre still gonna want to max it and packs will make that easy peasy
---
They fixed fast traveling after contesting a workshop and keeping agro/PvP enabled months ago. But, if your camp is close enough to the workshop, the PvP initiation sticks and your camp is fair game. Workshops are PvP zones, and PvP sticks, it is what it is. Don’t put your camp so close to a workshop and it won’t be a problem.
---
I like to deal on straight up “it’s like this, and this is why I think that”
---
It’s the way you’re wording everything, man. My first impression on that entire point of your post is that anybody that uses money that they went to a job to earn is just an entitled kid that thinks spending other’s money is fine. I’m going to buy my way up, because I don’t always have time to play this, and I have other games to play. But because of that, I’m just a 12-year-old with mommy card.
---
I farm the stupid mutants outside and inside of West Tek Research and National Isolated Radio for XP and usually get 2-4 legendarys per run.   As Ellenwood already pointed out, Leader of the Pack is great too, especially if you're on a private.
---
Do you know if similar happened with the CAMP build one? I've not had chance to double check my points tally vs what I should have, but thought I missed it.
---
&gt;  I haven't had blue screens in game for 3 or 4 months now.
---
That's good news!
---
Thank you for answering that for me
---
Yeah, salute was part of launch tri edition, people just had accidentally been able to use it for a while.
---
If you read care you can still buy the tri edition bundle upgrade but it's regularly half off every few weeks it seems.
---
Yeah me too re: floater grenades. Got a bunch off wendigos. I'm good with it, as long as it doesn't mean SBQ starts dropping lvl 1 drills again.
---
Okay, it still gives 10 for carnivore(relish) 20 for herbivore.
---
Cobbler still gives 5, and gives 10 for herbivore.
---
If only they had used what they had for the ammo press in the Pitt DLC for Fallout 3....
---
Ah ok, cause I was recognized as a noob right as I joined, and some dude even said "hey there's a level 7 here neat" and he helped me up when I went down which was 2 or 3 times, but I died a lot. I was hoping it would be like I would get a crop tone of xp for helping kill a lvl 95 sbq, but I was wrong
---
I’m just amazed that the reflex sights and scopes still use the handmade’s system of mount instead of the rail that’s clearly there.
---
Before this update any meat gave 0 food to herbivores  but you could get the bonuses (same applied to carnivores with vegetables and fruit). Ribeye steaks would give +20 carry weight to any herbivore but now it's a +0, also you don't get any other bonus from food now like for example canned meat stew that gave a +5% exp before this update and now it's a +0% exp. It would be quite unfair if carnivores can get a free item that does not rot and gives an exp bonus too just for doing that event but herbivores can't get anything like that in the game.
---
Also they didn't say anything about this change in patch notes and it's a very drastic change to not mention it so it must be unintended.
---
Definitely not.
---
Alright, maybe that is a little stereotypical, and sure, there are people who’re buying their way up because they don’t got the time. But there’s a reason it’s a stereotype.
---
Great idea!!!! Thanks :D
---
yeah... that's what i did when i was brand new. in fact, i needed to level up for the daily today and that's still what i did. you won't have good gear, but you can exploit pathing when you have endless ghouls coming at you, by getting up on something then just picking them off. but other than that... events are probably key for ya as well.
---
I'm not one to bash peoples hard work, but this damn thing is a joke.  Don't get why its a terminal either..  Make it a stinking workbench...  Fail....
---
There aren’t enough perk packs as rewards to do anything significant...
---
I wouldnt leave you hanging out to dry like that if i opened a public team..
---
of course.. I would never start the team.. but if I did...
---
A duper is likely to have hundred's of thousand's of every ammo type so converting is not really on their to do list. Especially since the value of ammo tanked anyways.
---
They did do that. That's how we got Creation Club for Fallout 4 and Skyrim....
---
The worst part is I do love the modeling on this skin. The AR body, the little details on the painting and the Nato. Cal size. The guys who modeled it did a good job... the guys who implemented either needed to send it back to be changed to fit the limitations of the handmade animation, or just spend more time changing it. 
---
I love the skin.... but the rush feel of the implementation is a huge turn off
---
You’re not but the rest are... It got up to 5 upvotes then it was killed by more Todd boys.
---
As the guy who stands on the power pole with a guass shot gun on line in the sand... you are not wrong.
---
Lol true, didnt think about that but now I cant unsee it
---
Yeah I honestly never wanted to invest gold in those plans but I’m okay with finding them, definitely adds a bit more variety and I can confirm I haven’t been getting any drills from SBQ today lol.
---
I've found some challenges glitch are reward early (at completion of 3/5) than do not reward when fully completed (5/5). I did all the daily and weekly challenges today and this happened on 2-3 of them total
---
This is worse than BFV's Tides of War (Season equivalent)
---
You're probably right, i'm just concerned about the future S.C.O.R.E rewards if all they can muster up is shitty skins and more effort than reward utilities.
---
You see, the solo part is what kills me. Even though 76 is mediocre and generally fucked, I would play this thing more if I had friends to play this with but with it being broken at launch and currently mediocre, no one plays it. It's a vicious loop
---
I dunno about that.. they very well could make the difference in full upgrading a animated perk card to get you over the top for the next * on your LP.. not to mention the new animated cards you get..
---
I aint saying its great.. but its better than cosmetics IMO.. of course at the end of the day I would still rather just have straight up currency...
---
Yeah, pay me for being the bug tester lol
---
This is ridiculous.
---
This game shouldn’t be designed around what the fucking hackers are going to do, it should be designed around the actual players and add I dunno maybe a security team to worry about that aspect of things? This is some c team bullshit. They only brought the A team back to fix wastelanders and then put it right back in the hands of these useless chucklefucks.
---
Thanks
---
You have to buy that one at a secondhand store
---
The 1 for 1 trade? I thought the machine was way worse ratio.
---
its not but fortunately the real money trading definitely is
---
Yeah I feel ya. I was kinda hoping to start making enough revenue and find enough food and drinks and stuff and open a little restaurant or something, but sadly only 4 per team which sucks. And I cant invite me people ya know. I was thinking I could be a traveling merchant when the game first came out but I never got it in time.
---
All they needed to do was set a system where you could tag on the machine what types of ammo you want to convert, then just give you an option to convert all, every time... so easy!  But they made this instead... it's really mindboggling.
---
Gotta have that Ratatat even if it puts me in the poor house.
---
Early days yet, Im gonna have faith that we see some good shit in there. Suggestions can never hurt and I know they're reading these.
---
2 one 5
---
what bug?
---
U can't be poor when u look this cool
---
I think time gating it is truly ridiculous given the fact they gave no indication it would be and basically promoted it as you can earn score every hour to two hours. They said you'll get SCORE for doing events which is technically true but a major slap in the face.
---
I mean it's a damn weekly challenge to doing 5 events in a group, that is very different from how they promoted it. That is my main issue with this. Also I feel I lost out on a 1000 SCORE for the gather building supplies, think I'm level 6 or 7 now, not sure how much SCORE I should have, having done every daily and still having 3 weekly's left I think. I know I got Level up 3 times to do and Kill 10 Legendaries. Not sure about the 3rd, unless I only have 2.
---
I do feel this is feasible to do without spending atoms and without dedicating your life to it. The day they reset Weekly Challenges (assuming Tuesdays) is the day you need to put the most work in. The next several days you can hop on, play for maybe an hour and get off. Sure it's more than I do now but shouldn't be too bad, least I hope not.
---
I like it but...
---
I am impressed that bethesda managed to delete the mechanic that provides atoms for free and spin it as a good thing.  This is why they went over the top with the bells and whistles, to distract from this fact.  This new system is literally rigged so you need to spend atoms to complete it, eating into any you pick up along the way.
---
A few rewards are really neat, but you could have bought all that and much more from the atom store if instead you spent till september grinding challenges for atoms.  Now you just get caps and boxes of junk with the occasional real reward.  Most these skins would have been sold as sets but must be earned separately, you also dont have the benefit of buying them when discounted.  Numerous big wins for bethesda while we are left chugging a pool's worth of snake oil through a shiny straw.
---
Despite being a very raw deal for players, this reward system does feel more gratifying and contributes to a richer experience.. Just hate how they got stingy and pulled cards off the table.
---
When you still have to boil water one at a time...
---
Its hilarious you guys upvote hiding in a bush , imagine playing a 20-30 minute Nuclear Winter match just to hide in a bush, “for fun”
---
You’re welcome! Thanks for sharing your cool outfit! :)
---
how dare the people that want to make choices about their teammates... /s
---
if i was bloodied, i would absolutely HATE IT if someone on my team would run rad sponge
---
Yes, I had heard about there sometimes being a lag, so I tried to loot from time to time over 10 or 15 min, but nothing developed. It’s all very strange. I’ve received nothing from a legendary SB or SBQ all day.
---
I was more so referring to the ammo machine and the broken rewards we will receive
---
Where do i get them? I have one gifted to me but im keeping that one for myself
---
Lol
---
Sometime this fall
---
When I said 1:1 trade I meant trading to other people.
---
There is also the fact the class freak does not reduce the penalty. Would not mind this change one bit (and actually like it now that I know it's not a bug) if Class Freak was fixed/updated as well.
---
No wonder this game is boring you find enjoyment in counting your comments
---
Assuming you get to rank 90, they give you the equivalent of 1500 atoms if you don't spend any on anything, add this to a fallout 1st subscription if you have one, and thats 20 or so levels you can skip. Sucks because you have to have patience but it won't be that bad. The grind isn't necessary but just the fact you can't even get it all with the base challenges is insane.
---
my money would be on after patch 20 however it will be before patch 22 if i had to guess.
---
I'd like to know how this broke any rules?  The only thing I think could be argued is meme content but I've seen posts WAY more meme-y than this that have stayed on the sub.
---
Yes, I have perforating mags on both of my Gauss shotguns.  I think I’ll go back to standard paint, as that is the last change I’ve made. Can’t hurt.
---
i completed the reputable 4 times today by just playing and i leveled up once so pretty standard to my regular playthroughs
---
You can't have Furious and Anti-Armor on 1 gun.
---
No promotional images of the R91 skin for the Handmade means we probably aren't getting it for a very long time. Shame considering it works a hell of a lot better with the animations than any of the Screaming Eagle variants do. All I want out of this set is the Bog Wanderer outfit and the mixed wood walls/flooring.
---
You must not know how mtx works
---
Mtx?
---
It’s too good to use. It eats 308 in a blink.
---
If you are vats heavy build go with armor pen if not go tse I dont use bullet hoses my self I like to aim and kill in 1 shot
---
Still good
---
Sometimes I don’t get any but then I’ll server hop, compete an activity and then get double or triple. I don’t know if it’s catching up or giving me more than I should get. Give it a try, maybe you’ll recoup your lost SCORE
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
good luck with this... it’s micro transactions galore now. they took the COD seasons way out to make more money (cod has the seasons too)
---
This is still a thing yes. It’s not a bug so it won’t be patched
---
https://youtu.be/vmqTygGx25Y at ~2:02:50
---
It wasn’t a trailer, just an interview with Jeff and Ferret about Update 20. This was clearly recorded a while ago for that original June 18th date, as Jeff talks about Legendary Perks coming in Update 20 which they didn’t, and targeting release for the end of June which already happened. They briefly talked about One Wasteland at the end, but no trailer and nothing much more about the rest of summer or any other DLC down the road.
---
If we get just 100 score from events, I'd be pleased.
---
I just want to say I think it’s awesome your Grandfather plays, and is a bloodied build!
---
They still haven’t made an attempt to accommodate ultra wide monitors and resolutions. I gotta wait for a single guy on nexus mods to run his scripts and update his ultra wide mod to make it easier on the eyes.
---
Micro transactions?
---
You're right, sorry I misread it in my inventory. It's actually a Furious 50% LD 10mm smg
---
I updated with a build i did and didnt have the budget issues i thought. Your budget is determined by rank so its relative.
---
they should apply this logic to the enclave scout masks
---
I would choose the tse because of the explosive effect. Does good against groups.
---
&gt; PSA: how many times are you gonna comment to hide in a bush before you realize you AFK a video game just for fun
---
remember? I promised to answer you and I am a man of my word..
---
also I dont play that game mode derpy.. but I do post redundant replies to redundant threads..
---
the other thing I do is draw out long conversations clowning on fools.. its kind of a hobby of mine
---
Weird, I had no idea. I didn’t have it for the longest time, it wasn’t until I completed the main quest line and launched my first nuke was when it showed up for me. It even appeared in the top left corner as it unlocked.
---
I had 3 done at the time though.
---
&gt;maybe just some other issue in the backend
---
This would be my guess for most such unnecessarily convoluted crap. Probably something in the background that either doesn't allow anything simpler at all, or just not in a safe way (see displays, vending, storage in general). I'd say this is a very good guess indeed.
---
You just described the crafting system for prey
---
Only those who are worthy may wield it
---
Looks like it doesn't.
---
The missing SCORE rewards definitely need to be fixed asap. The ammo machine is a bit of a pain, no doubt. However at the same time, we didn't even have this option before. More options sounds good to me.
---
What do you buy with your fake internet points?
---
No they aren’t, please delete this comment, nothing to see here.  Start bitching about the ammo converter like everyone else.
---
I’m astonished at the stupidity of this comment. I tip my hat to you.
---
Yeah I played a single one and got the wreath as well.
---
Yeah, he got me into the game, I got him into Bloodied when one day I found a Bloodied ski sword and decided I wanted to do more research on Bloodied because I was actually deliberately running half health for the Bloodied bonus. I’m a big Bloodied now, and my commando runs at about 4% health except during PvP. My melee runs at 19%.
---
Tse will break alot 
---
Smg s are not really accurate enough to get full furious effect.
---
I would pick furious
---
also yeah i'm like 2 days behind my apex events too if i want everything i should play more, why they would give me everything by no compromise?
---
Nope they took the fortnite way out because of the item shop or the atom shop the only difference is the battlepasses are free. 
---
Cod has bundles and codpoints and I wouldn’t really say it’s like an item shop.
---
Yup not getting any holiday items either on my end 😅
---
Good question. Maybe the more internet points something has, the more likely it is to be seen. I have plenty of internet points, just not on this post. *I say with 5 post karma and 1k comment karma.*
---
It still made tons of money now it’s the people who didn’t want to spend tons of money to get skins or the collectrons or the outfits or the other stuff now the non cash cows will suffer because we can’t get the free cents of atoms now
---
how long it keeps the effect?
---
Wasn’t too worried about it just curious what happened
---
The music is pretty good
---
I wish all of the dailies could be started and turned in from the terminals in our CAMP.
---
This is the reason why I got rid of my mutations, and bought them individually.
---
Yea lol the whole point of the atomic shop is to make money. The more free ways you can get points in game the less real money gets spent. Thus restrict the amount of free points you get.
---
I maaaay have an extra... I'm not at home right but I'll check when i get home in about 5 hours
---
Same for me
---
I bet it was better than you thought too! :)
---
They messed up and has it so you only need to complete 3 of the 5 challenges. Your not missing any score because you’ve already gotten it and there is no need to complete the other 2 unless you want to for whatever reason.
---
It’s a bug that works in our favor
---
Let me spend 10 minutes converting 160 10mm to 20 whole 556 .... uhggg. I’ll just go do a lead run again
---
That makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up, then-
---
I'm down to join, I'm ZcriptureZ on PSN.
---
If they only let us scrap ammo in batches, I fail to see why we can't do that at a workbench
---
There was a comment I saw that said to buy all ranks it’s around 15k atoms?! Ouch that’s like 120 bucks!
---
It’s important to remember it’s a 1.50 cents perk level so that adds up quickly
---
until you run out of that ammo and it starts to eat away at your good ammo
---
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
The amount of times I’ve killed people for not taking off rad sponge despite me telling them it’ll fuck with my build... Then they have the audacity to complain when I due! My weapons and armor work at low health dip shits, want me to quit team and show you?
---
I don't care that it's a terminal.  The fact that you have to click 3 menus to trade in 18 rounds of .38 ammo, then 4 to spend it... They couldn't use something like a stash that's already working?
---
Not like there is anything worth looking at in a player vender to be honest. This is low on the list of things to fix
---
Had even worse case where Queen only had Rad-X on her. Go figure. It was minutes before the beginning of the yesterday's update though.
---
The clean sink is fucking useless too. It gives me dirty water and I can't spam it like I can spam the river I live on. I can get like 50 dirty waters in a few seconds from a river.
---
Id be hugging bushes not posting on reddit if I were you
---
I just wished they had made it a simple black skin, like in new vegas. I saw everyone on the sub call is a service rifle skin, then when I get in game it's sort of shaped like one but miscolored all over with random scribbles on it. So gut wrenchingly let down.
---
Downvote just to be on the safe side (:
---
Thank you!! Not very exciting or interesting, but I guess that's why Bethesda never advertised it on any of their platforms.
---
I should also add that turning the medical scanner in was a mission in itself.
---
Honestly just by doing the main quest is going to give you a ton of xp also another tip is the higher your intelligence the more do you get from things
---
I like what the division 2 does with their seasons where payment can only be made for levels in the last few weeks. It would be nice if competing the race normally was feasible before paying for it
---
until you run out of that ammo type and it starts to eat your good ammo
---
it's a horrible interface.  You shouldn't have to spam click it.  I'd rather just be crafting ammo.  Why not just say: take 723 pieces of this for credit.  Great.  Now, let me buy 200 of that.  Cool.  Done.  Back to gameplay.
---
I too am enjoying Nuclear Winter the currently not bugged reward game mode  
---
just business as usual yep
---
It does! Was on two separate teams and it worked both times.
---
its kinda their MO.. not really surprising
---
Now the non pay pigs will suffer because the greed of devs will make us people who don’t want to pay 10’s of 100’s of Irl dollars to get pixels just to get cool looking stuff in a game
---
thank you so much!
---
Yes
---
It's a repeatable weekly challenge that nets you 100 score for every 10000xp you get (seemingly indefinitely atm) from anywhere.
---
I thought it was with all rep? At least for me... :(
---
Well congratulations on your fake internet points. You sound very successful. 
---
Also, your post was likely downvoted because it was, approximately, the 150,000th post today complaining about this stuff. So, regardless of whether you are right or wrong in your statement, people have hit their limit on these posts for today and are exhausted with them.
---
I'm literally flying across places, it's great.
---
Yeah like they send us a message, maybe at crater and foundation they have deposits for the items similar to the red rocket fusion cores daily.
---
I had a rash of alien encounters the other day. Killed 4 or 5 (2 together at one point, arguing over a crashed satellite), saw 3 more all within a few hours play at various places around the map. I don't have the punk though, so perhaps it was just your turn for being targeted by aliens.
---
Yeah it appears to be fixed.
---
25 i think
---
Lmao a bit sad. Having so many willing people spending time testing yet the company doesn’t use this to their advantage. This company’s testing sounds like a start up company not a full blow gaming studio.
---
I wouldn’t call it greed. It’s a business. They gotta make money. I feel like they would make more if the game was f2p though since the player base could go up
---
No, I’m sorry but it really isn’t. The last post I made complaining about this crap was a while ago and I haven’t even made that many posts.
---
Edit: I totally misread that, my apologies.
---
Fixing  it would make sense and increase player enjoyment, but potentially reduce the time they engage with the game, and thus potential Atom shop sales - Bethesda.
---
They were makeing tons of money still
---
My friend said he got the 1000 points for the weekly robot challenge after only doing 3/5 challenges in it. It still says he can finish the last two and he's wondering if he'll get the 1000 points again.
---
Not your 150,000th, THE 150,000th post. Made by anyone in this sub today. All saying the same stuff.
---
Do events. Other than that good luck. Everything else is up to chance (rng). Angry turtle has some legendary runs on YouTube but I feel those have been nerfed. Either way all the legendaries are pretty much scrip.
---
If I could sell my 30k 5.56 &amp; 30k 5mm any cheaper I would.
---
This converting method via terminal sounds shocking.
---
Lmao
---
You on ps4?
---
Huh? I was with you until you started saying unnecessary remakes like trash and garbage and broken....????
---
I don’t know if your a troll or not but this is one of the best updates they’ve put out to date and believe it not the community so far has been enjoying it😊.
---
Are you okay or do you just like to hate on bethesda for no reason. Or maybe this is just because you like ranting online about successful things that bethesda worked hard for many years on. 
---
Maybe you should take a step back and live life a little before ranting online. This is not okay and there are people that can help with these issues. 
---
Bethesda is the best game company that has ever existed and the fact that they keep giving us amazing 10/10 quality updates is a work of art and I love it with a passion. 
---
So please for gods sake and for the community because people like you tend to fall into the toxicity group... please for all living humans that love this amazing perfected game... delete this mediocre of a post and move on in life. 
---
Thanks and I hope you get the help you need 😀😀😅
---
You didn't do enough damage. If you have damage numbers on you'll see most weapons barely scratch her. Plus you have to take into account accuracy which is also affected by latency.
---
Same here. I still finished them fully as not to break anything, but as you as your hit over 50 percent,  the game gives you the score
---
Think about it this way if you knew you could make money doing this why wouldn’t you
---
Get those lottery tickets while your luck is good!
---
It needs a complete overhaul and it's only been out for a day. That's got to be some kind of record.
---
Because the backlash
---
Lmao your the one who needs help bud. This game and this company are absolute trash. Period.
---
like getting hit by lightening yo.. congrats!
---
There is nothing good happening in the mode at this time. Move along and focus on other things, like the terrible Screamimg Eagle skin
---
He's that one guidance counsellor who thinks he's cool because he sits backwards on a chair :P
---
They should give sone alternatives to herbivore for weight for sure, BUT herbs and soups should not give any benefits to carnivore AS mutation description says (meat bonuses  are doubled and you cant eat plants). Same for herbivore, double all bonuses and no benefit from meat period AS mutation description says. Just need tuning to be fair for both mutation (yes, i miss energy, int and health regen from soups as carnivore)
---
Fr? I was doing 14+ dmg per hit and was lasering her...
---
I run shotguns exclusively... couple things outside the obvious like shotgun perk cards.  Enforcer is great... cripples all enemies, great for charging enemies n crowd control. Vats to select limbs is great. I also run the luck cards for vats to fill crit bar n grim reaper card. Vats is broken with shotguns n in vats do great dmg. I one shot almost everything with a headshot or torso. Other then that,  whatever that will increase dmg,  n cards u feel u need as everyone plays differ. I use gauss shotgun, and a great double barrel.  Plus another great one I have is a medic pump. Which when I hit a critical, it fills my health
---
ultrashite ammo is not possible in any machine, 1 less problem for me.
---
Yes, but not your problem; mine did not change with p20. Moreoever, it sucks just as much, but no more than it did...
---
Wow that's a lot of changes. What % of it functions at the moment? Also, yay,  transformation from a full price Fallout game to a  free to play/freemium mmofps to proper modern Live Services Shooter has been fully completed.
---
It's not that I want my money back because I feel cheated; I don't. I just wish I could take it back so as not to encourage this type of shenanigans... WTF Bethesda...
---
it visually appeals me more :/
---
Nope you need to stop. This company is amazing Period. You are the one who needs help and limited access to the internet for issues that you cannot resist. Stop ranting and start loving the amazing triple a title.
---
Or be a loser for the rest of your life.
---
EA does it every year and people shit on them. And then they go on to buy the games anyway. Gamers have no resolve.
---
In all likeliness it will come around the same time Season 1 ends in preparation for the Season 2 update whatever that may bring. I say in about 12 weeks
---
I’m still dumping .38, .44, middles and mini nukes.
---
context? i literally havent played in so long
---
Haven’t played patch 20 yet and this is not a good sign
---
I will never buy a ea game and never have so your point?
---
I wasn’t even aware seasons had started.
---
After taking his quest, when I returned I found him with the band listening to the music.
---
And refusing to talk to me properly so I can give him his damn watercooled bone saw.
---
Honestly don't even want to bother playing the game. They cut the number of atoms received by 85% and over half the spaces on the board are either garbage consumables or ingame currency. Now to find out you can't even hit 100 without turning the game into a full time job.
---
By point of comparison I've maxed the mission pass for Phantasy Star Online halfway through the season, only really putting effort into the game on weekends.
---
Lmao okay internet hero. This game sucks. That’s the truth.
---
I have a theory that they made it the way that it is so that they can maintain server stability and/or prevent exploits because the engine itself is garbage.
---
But I know nothing.
---
And instead of falling within the “hurr durr bugthesda doesn’t know anything and neither do people that give them money because they’re stupid kids” stereotype, you could just be a bit more mature. Have your own reason for not agreeing with buying atoms instead of “cod fortnite csgo kid spends dad’s bank account.”
---
Somebody else, literally anybody else at all: *makes a bitch post like this one*
---
All of r/fo76: *awards and thousands of internet points*
---
Me: *adds my $0.02*
---
ERROR! EEROR! THE PIGGY BANK CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE COINS. REJECTED.
---
Even CDProjeKtRED is shitting on them for that and CDProjeKtRED is one of the most trusted dev teams because they never fucked over their customers
---
Lmao okay loser that will never understand a work of art when they see it because there too busy ranting on there ass on the internet. 
---
This game is a work of art and that is the FINAL truth:
---
I must be old if i don't understand most of that statement
---
So basically we have to live with mediocrity if we want to see anything new?  I beg to differ.  They simply have no external QA or user acceptance testing.  If they actually pushed this stuff out to selected individuals first to see how it would be received and how user-friendly it was, these issues could be avoided.  At best this is a half-hearted attempt to be able to point and say "see, we listen to the community!"
---
Wrong
---
The fuck kind of stupid ass post it this lol
---
Correct
---
*"The ammo converter isn't garbage, it's outright disrespectful to the player base."*
---
Sadly, that applies to most elements of this game, which is why so much of it is still broken and so many issues continue to go unaddressed. 
---
Fallout 76 is about making the most amount of money while putting in the least amount of work. 
---
And that sucks, because as a Fallout fan, this game had so much potential. Instead, it's a gimmicky, broken, cash grab. 
---
Breaks my heart.
---
You’re one person. Most will. That’s why I said Gamers have no resolve. That’s why games like cod can sell a dot.
---
Nobody is quite sure what the minimum damage is but it's at least 1000. The issue I've found is it's so laggy at that event shots that are showing as hits on screen aren't registering on server. I've hit her for 1200 a couple of times on my rifleman and still got nothing.
---
god that skin, yes bethesda should divert all resources to fixing that and not look anywhere else for like a week or two  
---
for reasons
---
CoD is absolut trash
---
I tried it once to see, instantly scrapped it. I’d rather drop the ammo
---
do you have it maxed ranked? if so, why? i personally use rank 2 and have 1 on gun fu
---
Why ruin the disappointm... err, surprise?
---
Silly me, my mistake. Since everything is working as intended I will delete this. Obviously.
---
Beth's letting us VATS users know our days are numbered...being that they can't fix it and all...
---
CoD is childerens online daycare
---
What do you say now, Proventus? Should we trust in the strength of our walls? Against a NUKE?
---
The season Thing is clearly a cash grab, even if you did every daily challenge and weekly challenge, for 10 weeks not missing a single one, you still wouldn’t have enough score to reach the end of the season’s rewards; meaning that spending atoms is a mandatory to get all rewards. Oh did I mention that now we can only get 2,000 free atoms in the 10 weeks
---
It's OK they are gonna sell you some $10 S.C.O.R.E. boosters for seasonal FOMO.  
---
You think I'm joking but just wait, you might be surprised and frankly I wouldn't be...
---
You can have whatever opinion you want but the numbers don’t lie. MTX exists because they work.
---
I’m a little disappointed that public events aren’t awarding points like they said—but, the XP bonus on a fully bonded team when you’re juicing up your INT is major. So it’s not all bad.
---
They also make single player games don’t they
---
Somewhere in Bethseda's HQ a middle manager is preparing a PowerPoint slide that shows a spike in popularity thus meeting the goals for the year.
---
He\\She is cackling with glee...
---
Rip
---
Bethesda mislead us. You don't get score per event. You have the option to earn score by completing the even challenge.
---
It's a real weasel way of not telling an outright lie but hiding what the actual truth is.
---
For me, public teams are a means to an end. So far I like that event turn out is higher than I normally see but I get the sense that this might just be the honeymoon period. Not sure if it'll stay that way by the end of the season or even the start of the following one.
---
Now, I did learn something new.  I wasn't aware 10mm ammo was energy.
---
No, my reason for not agreeing with people buying atoms is because it supports bad behaviour (ignoring game breaking bugs and not listening to their community, as well as cosmetic glitches with atom store items.) I couldn’t give less of a fuck who spends the money, but that’s who the main culprits are.
---
I thought they were perfect 😔
---
I never play NW but jumped on due to this stuff. Can somebody explain the significance of what is going on?  I’m guessing these unlocks were limited before?  And is there any way to see what I’ve unlocked afterwards?  They pop up and away so fast.
---
AAA games that have all been nominated for GOTY and they don’t produce bug and glitch attled games unlike 90% of the other company’s out their
---
Wait does that include the nuclear winter challenges? Fuck that
---
Welcome to battle passes. It truly is a shitty practice in any game and is there literally to take what currency you have and attempt to get you to buy more.
---
Well at least you had the guts to help
---
“Bethesda get better” so you make no sense, and contradict yourself trying to be an internet hero. your an idiot.
---
I've supported this game from the beginning but a time gated season pass is fucking awful.  Pure Greed.
---
Yah instead I'm just going to uninstall. It's been fun guys o/
---
FNV plug-in limit has been broken??
---
New California mod is fantastic
---
Update - the mountain scout with the brown flight helmet 10/10
---
Ofc it does
---
It’s honestly bullshit. I enjoy collecting everything in the game but for me to have to grind every single challenge to get to lvl 100 on the Score is some true Scumbag developing.
---
the kind that go along with a stupid ass comment like yours
---
See? Now there’s an actual reason. And while I may not share the same view as you, I can respect that a lot more than just being called a little kid with my parent’s card.
---
Almost like the system is designed to make people pay for levels towards the end of the season... 🤷🏻‍♂️ Who would have guessed....
---
Tbh this update did nothing to the games replay ability, hopped on this game after 3 weeks of not playing and nothing has changed apart from boring challenge grind
---
Tagging /u/ladydevann
---
First off that is not me that is my brother second off you are the hater here I am not. Your the only hypocrite here when your obviously still playing. Stop trying to act like a a hater and start loving the triple a title that bethesda has made. 
---
Also Bethesda had there servers offline for nearly 8 hours because of ddoss attacks. saying bethesda get better is like telling your best friend to get better when there sick.
---
Oh right you wouldn’t do that because you hate and despise the game you toxic prick go get off the internet and go play roblox where you belong.
---
I'm glad I used the Rocksy glitch to get my ammo machine, fuck the devs. Ward's glitch still works too but I'm done with those grinds. I hope others are using the glitches too. We deserve a break like that.
---
I think I read someone said that remember back in the ikd days that legendary something?
---
Yeah I'm already rank 10 it doesn't seem all that bad.
---
You realize the Fallout 76 developed aren't fully in charge of the development of the game though?
---
There are vehicles in use in 76 also. Look at Crater, where a lot of construction trucks were used to dig up the space station and build up the area
---
Fridgegate quitters gang assemble!
---
1. I didn’t notice a change in my bloody characters. Actually, everything in the game is easier to kill and I take way less damage. 
---
2. You were never able to fast travel to workshops. 
---
3. I agree the patch/update is garbage. There is nothing I want to grind for other than the SS Guillie 
---
4. What did you expect. This is entirely what I expected. Guess I’ll wait for the next patch/update
---
5. I have saved all my atoms since I started playing and now won’t still use them. No mommies credit card needed.
---
Are ya winning son?
---
That must really vary by platform. On PS4 today most of the events I attended which would normally have one player (if any) had 8-12+ people there. Every server I joined had at least 2-3 active teams of 3-4. I s'pose what I'm trying to say is that the new system for advertising teams &amp; offering XP boosts to people who join seems to be working on console... well, until everyone gets bored of the new shiny thing, at any rate ;)
---
There are two other variants still in the files, and one of them is just plain wood trim. I'd suggest refunding the current one based on all the issues it has and saving those 500 atoms for that variant - especially since the issues will hopefully be fixed by then. There's no telling how long you'll have to wait for them to release it, though.
---
Ammo has no value, it can't be sold to vendors. I pick up ammo when ever I see it, if it's ammo I don't use I drop it cause it takes up space in my stash or weighs me down and when players visit your vending machine there is no guarantee they buy the ammo you sell even if your selling 1000 .308 ammo @ 1 cap
---
I think I have my camp at the same place as yours and I've got the exact same problem. There's a tent practically blocking my doors lol.
---
If I had to guess, it's probably because they want to keep parity between the PC and console interfaces, and so making a separate numpad section just for the PC version is outside their scope.  Which, frankly, is kinda stupid.  I could've saved SO much time being able to manually put in how much I want to sell my vendor items for rather than finicking with a slider and then using the arrow keys to move it up or down those last few...
---
You were calling me a loser? And I’m the only hater? You continue to look foolish child.
---
I gotta admit that response of yours was gangsta. Should have dropped the mic after that one. 
---
K.O.
---
Oh no! I'm not saying that no one is playing it. I'm just personally really hard pressed to find any friend to play this with who isn't disinterested in it within a day or two of an update. Wastelanders was an exception with maybe a week of interest. (I'm on PC, which from what I know is the only place that can have mods to make it better albeit only client side)
---
I have a packed garden, so that's just annoying. It's not hard, it's just the work required is annoying.
---
The tutorial literally holds your hand and tells you how to view them all. It's just another menu, it's not rocket science.
---
I had the wallpaper already but the floors curtains and the porch are worth it. Here is my first one outside. [first new house](https://i.imgur.com/WG3mgFj.jpg)
---
Your the only foolish one on the internet here. I am starting to wonder if you have negative iq in your iq balance. That is correct you are a loser and will never be a winner. You are still continuing to  hate on bethesda most ambitious triple a title yet you still don’t understand that you are the hater. Maybe you should go read the dictionary before fooling yourself with constant lies.
---
For 4 days into the game you're sure dreaming big. You need the plan for it from the Encryptid event, then you need to have better luck than winning the lottery to get a Fixer from the Purveyor and then have it roll as a bloody one.
---
Guided only gave me one today and I did it solo.
---
You should get some sleep. Everyone can see your on chems.
---
Got to complete the event called Encrypitide to get the plan "the fixer" or trade for it. Then go to Murg in the Rusty Pick and roll for it
---
You need to know the plan for The Fixer, which drops from the imposter sheepsquatch assaultron
---
Then you spend legendary scrip to roll for random ranged weapons and hope you get a bloodied fixer
---
Yikes, did you have a skin on it?
---
They only made Witcher Games and they’ve all been nominated for GOTY? Idk about that. Maybe my opinion on them is jaded because I didn’t like their games but like I said they make single player games so of course they don’t do mtx. Single player games usually don’t have that.
---
Thats a kind offer but I am really kind of enjoying the hunt for it. Just trying to find out if anyone knows the drop rate for it. If its super rare like the fixer and bear arms or if I’m just having really crap luck right now thanks anyways
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
No. My camp is South of Foundation. They contested the processed food plant. They put a tent outside my CAMP to attack me.
---
I will don’t worry mister settler.
---
Or the Herd Mentality mutation? I'm guessing not as well?
---
Didn't see this post when I was making mine.
---
Yeah, this is pretty stupid. /u/ladydevann we PC players still exist...
---
I think he means the fucked up free thing that shouldn't be fucked up this far into the game's lifecycle. 
---
I have absolutely no confidence in BGS to do something the right way, even though they're probably had months upon months to get this shit done right.
---
When last I had this SAME PROBLEM AND PEOPLE TOLD ME IT WAS FIXED, I suggested an option to "surrender" a workshop without having to fight.
---
Lmao I’ll believe it when I see it. That was patched very long ago
---
Jesus Christ dude post that in its own thread!!!!! That's epic and so proportionate.
---
I have played many games with a seasonal battlepass. Never have one of them has made it nearly impossible for me to get all the rewards unless I played everyday. I can understand locking a secondary reward tier with the standard tier to paid or in game currency only. COD, RDR online, PUBG, Fortnite and Doom and many other games all have some type of Series/Season/Battlepass but I’ve never not seen them make it like this. Yes a grind is part of it and that’s some of the fun but they get generous that if you start late you’ll still have time to catch up and sometimes even award Double Xp towards these rewards. So you think Bethesda will reward double points towards rewards? In my opinion I would say no
---
That’s like saying I miss the days when TSE was awesome
---
The Kleenex box must be just out of view 🤘
---
😌 music my child. Your reee is music to my ears.
---
Spend some hard earned $$$$$
---
Same here as well as with the one for gathering crafting material, once I’ve completed three of them I got the points.
---
Consoles could get buttons too, it would be similar to the method of putting in numbers using a remote on some devices. I mean d-pad selection sucks but better than the scroll bar. But for PC  we don't even have a scroll bar, just a convoluted menu tree.
---
I didn’t even know there was Tesla skins. I dropped it for a friend to use and then he dropped it back after and it was gone
---
alright thank you, i had the the plan for it but had no idea how to get a legendary variant.
---
All Bethesda’s previous games were single player to? Plus cyberpunk will be multi player eventually to
---
Thanks for the kind words but you must learn to love and appreciate and not hate. Also this does show that your a little delusional because I have no hatred in me I am not REEEEEEE. I am very pleased with the update that this triple a title has accomplished.
---
Go to bed child it is past your bedtime
---
Just logged in after being Mia for a while. What do I have to do to get started on this event?
---
Does anyone know if these will proc if purchased from a player or vendor?
---
Also you need +/- half a year or more if you are extra lucky :D  
---
I have been scripping 4 chars for over half a year. Got one blodied and one nocturnal :) RNG is friend with me :(
---
I had so much fun today. 12-14+ people at every event where usually there's one player, if any. New sink that fits in my bathroom below the giant radtoad with the spinning red light in his mouth while still leaving room for the decon shower.
---
UwU 😘
---
Yuck yuck 🤢
---
Yeah I played for two hours and got to 8 just doing unspec’d mele. Did the same runs Charleston, WS, Westek, Harpers, and the Burrows rinse and repeat. Got bored and shut it off.
---
Facepaints. Atleast add all the ones from fo4. I mean why not? Whats stopping them?
---
Check the grimoire, bruh.
---
I’m not sure what point you’re trying to say is. This Bethesda game is online so it has mtx like other online games.
---
I am a funny chap.. clearly
---
its not my fault youre bad at reddit...
---
I feel you though.. honestly.. Id be mad too if I got totally clowned by multiple people in my own snowflake thread...
---
I should also mention fixers can't drop from normal enemies, but do have a very, very, very small chance to drop from Ally side quests
---
Yes you were, don’t lie to us...
---
Considering I’ve seen a few other games with it, no I won’t be the least surprised
---
I haven’t noticed a difference in how much damage I take from mobs. But even other Bloodied builds aren’t doing the damage I expect. When I encounter a fellow BE laser user, I usually shit my pants and hope I pulled the trigger first. Now I’m tanking it with ease. And actually, before this patch if you owned it then it was always a free fast travel point for you and your team. I know this for a fact because guess what? Pretty much the only reason I took them was for fast travel at higher levels and the resources for low level. And to add to the entire shebang, the fast travel mat was the second most important thing in a workshop I’m actually using.
---
White wolf fedoras? From the Encryptid event. If you're trying to get the fixer plan you'll probably end up with 50 before you get the plan 😅
---
At lease now I know not to cash out for the ammo converter. Too bad its as my most coveted item. Before I stopped playing that is.
---
Ya to post some random fallout 4 mod screenshot
---
I mean that's exactly what happened.
---
Todd and his team created Fallout 76 and other helped but Austin Bethesda got stuck with the clean up and continuation of it. Todd's team royally fucked up and then put it on another team to fix it.
---
Never worked for a team. Only the person who owned it
---
Y'all wanted end-game content right? Right? Here you go! Lol. But for real tho, that's nuts. Good thing I don't care about skins or completing every single thing. Sucks for those that work all day. This on top of reputation grind for Ward. Damn.
---
Agree with others - two of my weekly challenges were awarded SCORE points after only completely 3 or so of the 5 challenges.  Not complaining mind you, I wasn't looking forward to searching 100 logs.....
---
Things can be "military" and post apocalyptic and still be cute.
---
Ran Project Paradise this afternoon and actually had 7 or 8 people show up. Managed to keep 2 of the animals alive, which hasn't happened in months.
---
Using any mods?
---
Thank you for being real. When did video games become this pool of "I bought this game so I i have the the rights to everything in it". Lots of peeps lives are poop so they take it put on games. Funny because lots of people who have cried about an atom shop in the first place are the ones crying about the atoms being taken away hahaha ha the irony.
---
What’s the nerf?
---
I crafted ammo earlier and it seemed to be working normally for me? What makes you think it was nerfed?
---
With my camp, that tent covers my crops.....
---
How will my corn get any sunlight now?
---
Grenades suck. I’d sell em to the vendor. I got them too.
---
I think the biggest issue for people is there isn’t anything else to do so this is their main focus. We need dungeons or raids or something to invest time in. This is a passive system we are treating as the main point because there’s nothing else to do.
---
I have the plan...PS4. Also have a B FFr 25%LVC too......( the the offers poor in! )
---
Everyone wears hats and helmets becuse the hairstyles are meh.
---
Well yes, actually I had forgotten that I installed some. Mostly "glow" mods
---
Open the map, select the social menu, go to team, select your name and then leave team. People have tended to come and go constantly, so hopefully no one takes it too personally if you leave.
---
Found it works with a Auto clicker so priase the gods I'm ...neutral about it now but your 1000% right it's a terrible process
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png yup, already bugged. 250 points from a daily, lost out on 2k on the weeklies.
---
Haha all good, I feel ya
---
What’s that gonna do?
---
Can you drop in/drop out from the teams ? Like, what if you only have a limited time, and the other teammates want to do a bunch of stuff ?
---
c'mon man.. 
---
did you even stop for 1 second to think of how much shit thats going to break before posting this?
---
I put it in and deleted it two seconds after I installed it - the worst interface ever.  Thanks for the build-up and excitement on an actual useful update item and then not letting us down buy screwing it up... again.
---
Here's a hit, customer-centric design.  Will people ACTUALLY use this thing?  NOPE
---
[Yep! With this you can load up to 255 plugins like all the other games without the game shitting itself in the 130 range.](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68714)
---
wait a while. it will slowly appear one by one on her corpse
---
K
---
But how will it break things?
---
seriously tho.. I agree.. it should stack at least 3X
---
Is the game on its last leg
---
That isn't a reason to hate the score system though. If people are treating it like the main game then that is entirely on them. Yes, bethesda could do more to make the game better, I 100% agree. But this was never meant to be a forefront main game feature, more or less something on the side while you play the actual game. I am just trying to shed some light on potential options that people may or may not have thought about.
---
The fact that The Pitt DLC did this properly and Fallout 76 cannot is telling.
---
Where do the rewards go? I don’t see where they went
---
Best to disable the mod mods (non texture replacers) until they get updated. Like SFE was just updated, so chat works. But PLM, IHB, EN, SE, BI and others might need an update.
---
You sure? Because to be totally honest I’m not 100% certain, but I do have a vague memory of all my squad fast travelling to the Hemlock Holes workshop and all ending up on the fast travel mat to defend it...
---
youre new here arent you? lol
---
They appear in the atomic shop
---
Chill. Patch 20 has only been out for a few hours... lol.
---
I don’t really care for the ghillie armor textures till I saw one for the scout armor (Which my main armor is full unyielding urban scout.) and a ghillie skin for the backpack. (Which is basically my black shovel backpack but matches the ghillie armor.)
---
I love new scout skins, I’m waiting for an all black one or chrome one.
---
How else is my garden ruined?
---
just crafted 556 ammo, with ammosmith its still 36 rounds each, amount of ressources looks like before. super duper triggered also. cant see a nerf.
---
Yeah I’m positive. I could never fast travel to my friends workshops unless they were there. If they are there you can travel to them but if they are not there no luck
---
Why are you on this sub?
---
You can do it in the menu on the map, “change appearance “
---
I have lime 100 cards to open...should I open them all?
---
That’s.... not proof of anything
---
You forgot to include another common requirement that people would put down: 
---
'Hot chicks only! - Must have mic and send pics (clothing optional)'
---
'
---
What have you got for trades? I think I’m in the market for a a fairly good fixer, I’d trade the mini gun and all the ammo for something good.
---
To this subreddit yea but I’ve been playing since the b.e.t.a.
---
Now if it’s a “defend” event you can travel there or if a friend is there. But you can’t just travel there whenever you want
---
You can still tame them.
---
Hope that makes sense
---
I just pulled a AA-%33Hc- I think 250 drwa
---
Then pulled a Junkies %33Hc +1 Perception 
---
And got a two shot/ limb damage That . Will. Anileate !
---
I have suddenly stopped  getting SCORE after rank 7.   2 weekly challenges were complete and not S.C.O.R.E. points.  2 ppl i know who did the exact challenges and got their points. If this keeps up, I wont continue until this is fixed. 
---
I love this so far, but bummed out about this bug.
---
Did it by accident during a fight not long after the patch went down.
---
In this case, rolling is referring to them crafting the Secret Service set. The set uses legendary modules from the purveyor giving them legendary effects/stars. It's randomized tho so people often have to rectify/reroll them
---
This sounds a lot like post rationalisation or like the kind of shit buyers remorse people do to justify a bad purchase.
---
Not that we bought the season pass (thank god!) but giving up atoms that Bethesda has now nerfed I believe for the 2nd or 3rd time, saying that you can spend those precious few atoms on making up the missing ranks is not only not helpful but precisely what Bethesda wants. 
---
There will be a time, no matter the player's circumstances, that they will have to spend extra money if they want to consistently hit the Rank 100 rewards.
---
That's not great but it would have been a tad more palatable if Bethesda just upfront said you can only get the highest rewards if you paid us. At least we could respect them for telling the truth and not try to mislead us.
---
You’re right but people psychologically need a purpose in the game and without a new main quest or raids this is it so it’s bring extra attention. Look at CoD. They got a battle pass but you know what they also are constantly adding things in the game to keep people actively engaged. It’s not just the same game since launch but now with a battle pass.
---
Your convinced that Fallout 76 is actually a good game when every hour or so you disconnect. Your the special one here when you keep going on about how you find joy about this update when clearly they using atoms shops stuff.
---
Not all online games HAVE MTX dumb ass
---
I’m curious to see what it’s revenue looks like. I can’t imagine it’s being bought by new players much.
---
When they charge people for stuff this, i lose my sympathy. No other industry could get away with such consistently lazy work and still make money
---
it shouldnt really unless youve got designs on being full health in which case there are some perks you probably have that you may not need so much anymore
---
There was some debate about that... Last I checked the initial placement of the camp sets your spawn for you and for visitors. Changing the location of the camp unit does change the spawn location but I believe it only changes it for you and not for visitors, they still use the original spawn point. I could be wrong on that last part though.
---
Can confirm it’s fake. Saw it on Facebook, and as a result instantly knew it was fake news.
---
Dude, you expect me to just video this when I have no idea it's about to happen? I don't have friends who play the game so I can't get a proper test going. What else would have caused my garden to be destroyed? What would I have to gain by claiming an allegedly "fixed" "bug" is actually not fixed? I just want to play the game and not worry about this happening.
---
This. You might want to let us know what was actually nerfed about it.
---
If you mean you don't get double the full ammosmith perk rank ammo with the duped stuff, it's been that way as long as I could remember.
---
Ok, disabled the mods, still did not work.
---
Tried to scan and repair, did not work.
---
Thought it might be better to delete the whole game folder and load the game again. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Magic heavy guns still work as in patch 19. Tested it
---
I have had buyer's remorse since I bought the collector's edition. (Big oof) As for what this is, it's just to show people some options they have. I personally am just going to sink my extra atoms into the board because atom shop items are either buggy or not worth the purchase. I am basically paying to have the scrapbox and whatever else I get is just bonus.
---
Nah you can run low or high health on junkies. I switched to junkies and run vanguards I never die lol.
---
solo? GL
---
in a public server.. hit it enough for drops and hope someone else melts it after a while..
---
if youre bloodied stealth rifleman.. you ought to be able to do it quickly if youre built out correctly
---
You might want to read a few hot posts before posting something like this.
---
You'll see what I mean when you do.
---
Name 3. I didn’t mean that in the literal sense btw lol but it’s a standard thing to see
---
A river is 100 times better than the clean sink. You can't spam the sink for 50 dirty waters in a few seconds. I'm glad I live on a river.
---
For armor half the time the names are so friggin long you cant even read if it's a leg/ arm/ chest!? I completely disagree its something that definitely needs attention.
---
I doubt people start spending atoms for these rewards. Hell I haven’t spent any atoms since I started playing in 2018 and have amassed 25k. Was happy I had something to spend them on but after seeing the rewards, I doubt I spend them to progress through this crap. I’ve been on my exit for awhile.
---
Sure I do! And technically it is a black market because RMTs for ingame currency and ingame items is against Bethesda’s ToS.
---
yeah, i did 6/5 assorted robots, challenge is grayed out, no score awarded
---
There has to be a reason they haven't added text chat, but they haven't said why.
---
I’m not convinced....I know that this game is the best game I’ve ever played. The only person that’s disconnecting from reality is you let alone the game. Bethesda probably doesn’t want you playing there triple a title since your very hateful and disgusted at there perfect art form of a game. Bethesda thinks themselves that you are the only one who is special and should get some help. I find joy in this game because it is a masterpiece and clearly you are delusional. There also not using atom shop stuff they even said that on the website. Like it’s pretty easy to comprehend not that hard
---
I would have to go threw over 300+ games to find ones that dont
---
Keep the bloodied shell and just change weapons. When you're lower health, you get stronger and hit harder but you have the flexibility to go full health (e.g. rad zones) and not worry about your damage getting nerfed in the process, relatively speaking.
---
Oh good. So I'm not the only one. I was wondering why I suddenly got 1000 score when a 3/5 popped up.
---
Your hurting your case and proving mine but ok
---
Thanks its a first try. Ive got so many ideas right now lol
---
Like they fixed the bugged RedRocket garage door when it released (and removed again a few days later) more than a month ago! (its still broken) 
---
They don't test, and fixing anything takes forever, if they even will.
---
Need to test that more but looks right so far glad they did that
---
It's pretty rare... The 3 safes in cemetery by lewisburg is where i found them a couple of times... I think i ended up with 2 plans out of 40+ times checking the safes
---
I was thinking of combining the two honestly
---
I think it’s more of a thing where people find one little thing and grab onto it like a blood sucking parasite.
---
thank you! was feeling super stoopy this morning cause i couldnt figure it out
---
Had to scroll about twenty posts down. My point still stand that they should be able to add content without fucking with things that have existed since the beginning.
---
To be fair, wastelanders changed the game a lot. If they keep on this track of updates with more people, interesting stories, and things to do, the game can be very good. I feel like it's just in a weird spot where it's just beginning to be good but it's too early to say it is, if that makes sense. I want to have faith that this game will turn around, we all will just will have to wait and see.
---
Well, I guess that makes sense... Ish. Unless I’ve just been lucky this whole entire time and whenever I’ve assisted defend a workshop, usually from people that either totally kicked our asses or got flattened (with PvP in this game there’s no middle ground unlike GTA or some other games that have PvP) and always FTd on the mat even when it wasn’t mine, but a teammate’s perhaps.
---
The only time I buy something from a vendor is to get rid of caps. Could care less what it is and it’s always scrip. I’d buy the most expensive item even if it wasn’t legendary. No one puts good stuff in there for caps.
---
Not. Its for sale inside whitesprings easily missable though
---
From my perspective, what you're doing is saying the very thing we already know about - you can buy your way to Rank 100. 
---
It may not cost you any actual money upfront but it will eventually, to every player.
---
Even if you're a 1st sub. I mean you're already paying but now you're removing precious atoms you could have put to Atomic Shop items which you now can't because they're going to Rank 100 instead, possibly even pushing these people to spend more.
---
This isn't something to look at with relief. It's still a pretty bad situation if you care enough to have Rank 100 rewards.
---
You realize who hired them?
---
Lol. Damned. Thought I had something. Thanks friend.
---
Nah, I've gotten more than 1 1 star shit from a 3 star monster.
---
How disappointing.
---
I mean 90 percent of those the 300+ MTX is pay to win so I have to find the ones that have no cash shop
---
Guess it’s a mute point if it doesn’t work for you anymore lol. Just offering my experience ya know. With this game nothing surprises me
---
The best thing you could do with that kind of build is to act as support for the people who are hard carrying the event. Get your hits in to secure your SBQ loot but after that keep the trash mobs away from these players and revive anyone that needs it.
---
You'll actually be more useful and it'll be more fulfilling without wasting ammo on a target that you won't have all that much of an impact on.
---
Jokes on you, this character never had adrenaline in the first place :D
---
My commando Bloodied character is angry though.
---
I'm a little frightened the seasonal method is going to get boring really quickly.  It ended Destiny 2 for me, which up until that point was my favorite game.  I know creating new story material and locations and missions is resource intensive, but it is the most enjoyable for me.... maybe I'm not cut out for MMOs....
---
They should do it like Warframe. You have to be within a certain radius of a team member for the XP they get to also go to you. Maybe they're worried about vets power leveling new characters?
---
Wastelanders was a ok update that certainly made the game tolerable imo but it’s held back by just bad design. Between the pointless factions and the bullion it left a meh taste to me. But meh is better than eww which is what the game was before
---
I will keep checking there then. Thank you.
---
Are these all games you own
---
Do you remember Halloween NW reward system? The same person did this.
---
Coulda just been from the experience one been trying that one but the 50 xp from it's a slow build unless u run activities by yourself to get all the kills you can private server pry be the best bet so ur not competing with others or atleast a small group I'm considering posting tommarow to see if anyone would like to join me on with 2 or 3 people
---
I'm not saying your point is invalid but you'd already have the answer to your question.
---
I play a lot of games?
---
I haven’t played workshops with friends, but having to pay to go to your own workshop? Like, daaayyyymmmm that’s a low blow. I have to pay to use ammo to defend it (unless I’m playing my melee low level, already outdamages legacy yielding commando), I have to pay to take it and now I have to pay to fast travel there.
---
Can't it be both? :)
---
I wouldn't call it stupid. You just didn't know. Now you do.
---
You could say this post is just for people like me, which i'm sure i'm not alone. Atoms are precious maybe once a month, if that, if something amazing comes to the atom store. But lately, it's just buggy item after buggy item that doesn't look like it will ever get fixed. Looking at you PA helmets lamps. Maybe what I am doing is exactly what Bethesda wants but honestly it's my choice to do so and it's my choice to put the atoms in the board. This is why my post said "may" not be as bad as you think. For people like you, maybe it is that bad, but for me, i'll be skipping 30+ levels and enjoying that tier 100 items for as long this game holds my interest.
---
Bunch of people left and move on.
---
But why? Atom shop is lame.
---
Wait... you now have to pay to go to your own workshop? That’s definitely new
---
I had this exact feeling on an Encryptid earlier. Everyone actually worked together, we waited for a big crowed to start it, whole event was wrapped in under 5 minutes and probably closer to 3.  It ruled
---
Ah right right right, I forget what one was at but its low oof
---
Secure Choice One-Hundred percent Refined Events
---
I am strongly disagree with u. I used to leave all ammo I dont use in the shoping area and now I can put it close to machine so people can stay at my CAMP for hours to play with this converter!!!
---
Same. Probably the code was put in. I’m hoping Beth doesn’t take them back.
---
Yep! I did say that in my post. It’s batshit crazy. “But no. My main issue is they’re no longer free fast travel points!”
---
Is that a yes lol I ask because you say you don’t and won’t ever buy a EA game for its mtx issues but you also seem to have access to 300 games that’s you yourself said are p2w so I’m confused
---
If you can buy it from a robot vendor, it ain't rare. Now crafting and selling rolls at a good price? Well that's different. Maybe I open myself a fallout cinnabon....lol
---
Problem is, does it factor in the problem of getting kills on a high populated server, without being the jackass who kills everything on one shot?
---
I mean, INT should be globally better, but if I cannot tag almost any mob on an event, and wes tek and golf club are being farmed... Is still better than + event exp? Please show me the difference.
---
You get a bunch of cosmetics from the season, but you don't get to make choices. :(
---
Like you take the workshop, then go about your game. Then to go back you have to pay to travel there? Am I understanding this correctly? I may have to see this
---
Yeah, I logged in after maintenance to take a look at the board. At a glance I would say I won't get half way through it, let alone finish the whole thing. Shame too, the gatling skin is the only thing I wanted and it's too far in.
---
You certainly are reading that correctly, and I’m hoping you’ll sign the petition to change it back... My melee needs more quants too.
---
I guess I could just be a different breed but I didn't find the bullion grind that bad. Managed to get full T-65 and both gauss weapons, ammo maker, etc. I wasn't exclusively playing 76 though, switching between other games I enjoy and only hopping on for 2 hours or so for rep and notes. I know everyone doesn't have that time or is like me though.
---
Which weapon were you using?
---
Why didn't they make it more like a scrip machine?
---
- e) Scrap ammo
---
- r) Buy ammo
---
Also why in the freaking universe does it have that ugly terminal stuck to it?!
---
I must have misread. My bad. Once you take a workshop you were always able to travel back there
---
Oh yeah I forgot camps are indestructible except for players engaged in PvP. Creatures can’t do anything!
---
You’re making a ridiculous claim with a screenshot of some ruined crops as your proof. Fuck outta here
---
I have gotten three today and two were actually really good so that’s cool
---
Not anymore you can’t. It’s a real shame too.
---
I agree. I don't feel guilty at all about the Rocksy glitch. In order to max reputation it would take months of rinse and repeat mindless quests. It's just their way to force me to play, but it isn't playing. It's just boring grinding.
---
Actually the posts are all questions. That’s the opposite of an answer if you didn’t know.
---
Wow. Now I understand your post. My bad.
---
I haven't played in a few months because it feels like what you said - a chore. It's not fun anymore. There's little to nothing to do as an end game player and all the crashing and bugginess has gotten harder and harder to ignore. :/
---
I stopped playing before Wastelanders came out but hopped back on when it did for a few hours. Most of my gripes with the game are still there. It's not necessarily the content but the goddamn engine. This game should have been built from the ground up. A multiplayer game needs speed and QoL adjustments. You can't get that when the engine used is slow and clunky. Like seriously, we STILL have to get out of power armor to craft/use terminals? Some things don't need an animation. 
---
Fallout 4 was tolerable because it was single player. It can be paused. It can be modded too. Ya can't do that with 76. It's just a miserable experience. It bums me out because I was so hyped for this game. Convinced a group of friends to get it. We played a few sessions and they uninstalled. I kept going but it felt like a slow chore. It's a shame.
---
But still it would be helpful
---
Seems as 4 extra from the team isn't worth it with a high int. if you enjoy events more. But to each their own.
---
Who needs text chat when you can communicate by shooting at things?
---
Honestly, this is along the lines of what I was expecting. Not exactly but close.
---
I do UX and UI design for a living and if I would have given what they gave us to a client as a final product, they would have refused to pay and probably broke contract. That’s how bad it is.
---
Creatures dont spawn anywhere near my CAMP. Not a single one in the weeks I've been set up there. Even if one did, I have turrets that would've shredded them. Fuck outta here with your bullshit idea that bugs can't re-emerge.
---
I get what you're saying but how did you not understand that you could "buy" your way to Rank 100? That's the bit that's hard to understand. It wasn't like Bethesda was hiding this fact.
---
It is amazing how people familiar with computers could design an interface so badly. At one point I thought I was stuck in the interface without a way out, as Back was just taking me round in circles. I have both the ammo maker and converter and both have gone back in the box. Credit that they made the converter so easy to obtain though.
---
Yea good job Beth. So far all drops from bosses are three star ranged weapons (five queens two sheeps), this is unheard of in the past.
---
Workshops not being free fast travel points is my second biggest gripe here. The ammo machine is third (didn’t have to grind for that, took me what thirty minutes?) but the rewards for the whole legendary run system is my 100% biggest annoyance.
---
A lot of the "5" rewards are awarded at "3" instead, you may just not have noticed it. The robot one is one of those.
---
I'd rather have the Atoms than 100 pieces of crap I'll never actually use. They can keep the sink, the power armor skins (bought the RR skin), the backpack skin, the ufo playground thing, etc. I won't use any of it. I'm forced into this Just to get a few Atoms. It's participate or don't get any free Atoms anymore.
---
You have my support... especially with GOD mode. Can’t believe they haven’t fixed that for damn sake
---
Never sayed I did PTW did I?
---
I can say the same with my camp, but guess what, I’ve had weeks where nothing spawns and then out of nowhere a group of mirelurks spawn and get past my turrets.
---
Such a shame you’re so fueled with rage over some destroyed crops that you’re making a bogus claim with no solid proof. Fuck outta here salty boi
---
I don’t mind the bullion I hated the cap. I don’t want to feel like I have to play daily. And then I wanted the SS set but a good set. That’s a whole separate time gate. If I got a piece that one character couldn’t use but another could? Too bad. I gave up.
---
Maybe there’s still a chance but it’s way lower than before.
---
I’m a buy the game grind for everything person
---
I didn't know they were craftable. What are the ingredients?
---
It didn't for me. I both had it and shared it out and someone else shared with team. In both instances, I saw no change.
---
Make it do what it showed in the data mines, the animation showed ammo being dropped into it, not being feed into it a little at a time Smh
---
“I mean 90 percent of those the 300+ MTX is pay to win so I have to find the ones that have no cash shop”
---
Unless I misunderstood
---
God mode? Pfffttttt
---
I’ll take being called trash because I can’t kill a god mode PvPer over this PvE crap any day. I’m one of those rare people who appreciate both for what they are and enjoy both. I created a new character specifically for PvE, and respecced my main into a PvP monster.
---
That sounds like a plan, so if you’re not a Heavy user, you’re basically just being carried?  Are there any non-heavy builds that have any real impact on killing SBQ?
---
You could buy your way there, but as I also stated, I am pretty sure doing all dailies and weeklies until rank 90 will award you with 1500 atoms cumulatively from the whole board. If you were patient enough to do this, you would get the last 10 levels free with rank up and not even have to spend a dime. Would it take a lot of time, sure, but it's possible. For those people who don't want to wait, your fallout 1st atoms come into play.
---
Nope, tried, unkillable.
---
I haven't played yet, but according to the seasons site you can gain score outside challenges. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
I guess I'll find out when I get on.
---
&gt;Q: Aside from Challenges, what other activities will increase my S.C.O.R.E.?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;A:  In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by  gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily  Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other  rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other  methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
One: everyone pls quiet down about the converter. We get it, its tedious, it sucks, please move on.
---
Two: yea remove leveling up, once you hit higher lvls it takes ages longer than before.
---
Doesent mean I spend money to pay to win does it?
---
I dunno what luck you got, but maybe I've been rewarded with 1 to many GS2525 Gamma Guns for me to eligible for that.
---
God mode would be mine. But I quit doing pvp after wastelanders. Now there is a new weapons dupe out so this game is about to be really trash. Those BE plasmas are coming on Xbox. Watch
---
Some handmade with increased damage with mutations.
---
Oh no, not solo.
---
Thanks for the confirmation! The seasons site has the correct information about this, odd the patch notes are worded confusingly. Get ready for the "I got to rank 100 in 24 hours and now there's nothing to do" posts.
---
2. Is absolutely not an issue. We want to keep that.
---
&gt; There are fewer Atoms overall up for grabs in this new system, but you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges. As a result, you will still be able to save up Atoms for Atomic Shop items, but you will now also directly unlock lots of new items, including cosmetics for your characters, like Power Armor Paints, Weapon Skins, C.A.M.P. items, and more by ranking up. This wasn’t possible with the existing Challenge system, and **we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.**
---
It’s a cash grab
---
I know but damn let me actually be able to do it all day. Anthem had a huge grind too full of shitty legendary drops but you could constantly work at it. Here if you don’t get what you wanted within the daily caps you are literally fucked into the next day.
---
Bethesda gave the all clear, I wanted to see if they actually were being honest, they weren't.
---
Not everyone knows about that bug,  bethesda doesn't exactly warn people and besides if I crash apon log in,  how do I fix that on ps4? Not play? Rub Todd?
---
Were you engaged in PvP? If not they’ve got a new and even better griefing method :\
---
I understand that, didn't even bother with SS for that reason. Lucky for me I was a heavy weapons build and PA was the better option.
---
or this
---
Because it's a public team anybody can join you without your permission. It would be way to griefable if public teammates can build at your CAMP.
---
"if you pay the subscription every month and spend all your atoms in leveling score its easier"
---
at that point score its like buying atom shop bundles with extra steps, what a shitty take
---
&gt;Nope you need to stop. This company is amazing Period.
---
 Huh? I was with you until you started saying unnecessary remakes like Bethesda is amazing Period.
---
Come on dude. We all know that's just not the truth. You can like the game, like that the game is fun for you but no one -&gt; in their right mind &lt;- would say that Bethesda is amazing, period.
---
Weightless Shovel and Weightless Shishkebab are like the 2 must haves
---
A handmade is a good auto weapon but a poor rifleman one, use a lever action or hunting rifle instead. I would recommend a Gauss but they broke it in vats even more in yesterday's patch.
---
Um they can't. Every single patch has always screwed something up. Both minor and major. Even wastelanders wasn't perfect nor even the backpack update.
---
*JE
---
But they’re already here. Haven’t you seen them?
---
But the thing is it’s months of being fucked if you don’t get what you want atom shop waise
---
Ofc its a cash grab, more people people canselling 1st when boored with no content and all bugs that remain from release! They need to get money. 
---
There is 0 chance for a working family man/woman to get to 100 without atoms. 
---
Maybe if ya dont anything but the challenges but rewards are hardly worth it imo
---
Dude, nice.
---
Just switch to junkies and use your unyielding you’ll love it
---
get a fixer, handmade, lever or other fast shooting rifle
---
bolt action stuff is not ideal
---
This sounds very cool. I wish legendaries were more scifi and not just "magic". For instance FFR could be precision machined to allow faster mechanism movements. Explosive could be special explosive rounds. We could overcharge ammo like in FNV instead of 2 shot. Unyielding could inject more adrenaline and other chems the lower your health.
---
But you’re clearly fine with those games having that kind of mtx model but when EA does it it’s a problem?
---
I only seen the 10 BE plasmas tonight on a guy I used to play with
---
“As it is now, it's camp decoration.”
---
Nope. I won’t even let this dumpster fire take up camp budget. Already scrapped it. Useless.
---
I see, so instead of saving atoms for 2 weeks to buy a bundle, we now may have to wait 2 months and that is if it will even be enough to get one...
---
Holy mother of god
---
Can I have one? XD
---
That’s very doable ... I ran with a bloody and a junkies DCG just switched around 50% health ..
---
Have you looked for a discord server to join?
---
Sorry to hear, but its not faraway for me either to return to eso. Atleast theres endgame in there
---
I think the ammo convertor looks cool, but my god when I realised how it worked, I knew it was over.
---
Guess I'll just keep selling ammo or chucking it.
---
He wanted to sell me one for $300. Not my thing
---
I was told there would be no math...
---
More like more value for the corp bottom line, less free atoms means more likely people will buy atoms to get what they want.
---
You are free to think this, I have no interest in most atom shop items. For people who may not have thought of this, it's an option. For people who don't want to do that, just progress to rank 90, don't spend any atoms earned off the board, and boom, easy free 10 levels if your patient enough.
---
Welp I am already a day behind now. (What's the point.)
---
Games almost 2 years old and while WL added some new and interesting stuff its essentially a 1 and done piece of content built around a grind that revolves around the same exact pattern of events. Score leads us right back to it not to mention daily and weekly tasks still can bug out 2 years later and they are currently bugged right now. How many more times do we need to run west tek or the same 5 events? Theres just zero substance and on top of it they keep breaking things or the new stuff is broke. Its just exhausting. Its all just pointless tedious xp farming with no real payout in the end. How can we care when from the outside it looks like they dont give a shit either. 
---
Honestly WL put this game on a high note and than it immediately crashed to its lowest point with the grind, the duping, pails and fasnacht alot of people are over the mindless grind and now to see even if you managed to do every challenge all season you still wont hit 100 like wtf is that?
---
dont shoot the messenger...
---
I did say “used to play with” lol
---
Well shit, hell no. That’s a third of my savings. An entire god damned third. Not happening...
---
Can you get the payed currency in this game without have to buy it with rl money? No can you get the skins and stuff like that without the rl currency now? No
---
if it keeps increasing and you are at level 10 then you are 5% of the way to the end.
---
He’s gonna kill the market I’m sure. I’d wait it out. Soon we may all have one lol
---
Yep, same here. I think it's bugged somehow, but you don't get points at the end so I guess it's not a huge deal. Just helps us out by only needing 3/5 😂
---
Wish you could do that on public. Having group members come to your location is annoying.
---
In wow you can get sub for a month threw AH in runescape you can get a sub threw the AH
---
Mines been working just fine today. Did you check the atom shop under emotes and see if it needs to be reequipped for some reason?  If I remember right emotes need to be equipped from the atom shop. 
---
Also might want to mention which system your on.
---
Have you bought the tricentennial edition?
---
Are you stupid, high, or drunk ? Or one of Todds boyfriends?
---
This is called boredom. A phenomenon that can actually get to anyone. In such cases people look for another occupation or go to work. I know this is hard to imagine. "How can it be that I'm getting a little bored right now? I always had so much fun doing the same thing every day..." The sad truth is... you can get rid of boredom so easily. But you have to be the actor. I believe in you. You can defeat Boredom. 
---
Don't forget to wear a mask. Boredom is contagious.
---
I’m hoping so, my melee will go melee/heavy PvP and grind for Strangler Heart (again but with bullion instead of Vault 94.) Now as much of an absolute cunt the Vault was, I’d rather do that for three months than the bullion.
---
does explosive bait still destroy camps?
---
it's a cash grab yes. but also, with unlocks we now get a lot more stuff for free. i have like 8k atoms right now and it's been a while since anything in the atomic shop interested me enough to buy. the free stuff we'll get probably would cost more atoms then we could earn in that time to get it...(granted, most of the stuff we probably wouldn't have wanted badly enough to spend atoms on) but, they're putting more things behind a grind and tweaking their business model, presumably to increase subscription numbers or very likely even more pay to win elements down the road, like purchasing score points and maybe even purchasing gold at some point. but ultimately, i don't see it as any more cash grab then it has been... just tweaked a bit. nature of gaming in general right now. if they didn't think they could milk more out of the game then we wouldn't be getting any more updates tho... so...pros and cons.
---
Pacifist life for me.
---
They tried to murder my frozen ass with Explosive Bait afterwards, but they somehow failed to blow up a frozen target.. Then I left. They were not the brightest bunch I guess.
---
Btw some perk card aren’t working such as adrenaline rush I don’t know if it’s only for me it’s not working
---
If you hold the back button on whatever system your playing on you'll leave the terminal all together. Completely avoids the near endless clicking.
---
I just make sure I claimed it when I see it trigger. I got to 8 in two hours doing the same mele runs.
---
It was for the tricentennial edition of the game, a bug gave it to everyone else. They fixed it.
---
Well they’re bright enough to use a cryolator! Just not bright enough to realise you need to shoot the bait.
---
I kinda liked the vault raids. It was actually challenging
---
What? You don’t have to pay for the atoms.
---
yeah man you right, I'm just bad at the game
---
at the end of the day I would rather still be getting atoms to buy what I chose than accepting what they decide to give me...
---
What’s AH
---
Yes you do my dude
---
There’s challenging because it’s genuinely challenging then there’s challenging because it was an unstable timed raid where it was almost impossible without a good, not janky server, and precise squad manoeuvres.
---
That was a big, only people who bought the tricentennial edition of the game but a bug allowed everyone to get it.
---
Not much. Imposter suits a little more but they arent very valuable anymore.
---
Are you dumb? Auction House
---
its borked..
---
also...
---
PRO TIP: check the hot tab before posting
---
Did you try to search this first?
---
lol you need a truckload of wood leg pieces to qualify
---
Yeah. The ones I've found have been a mix of people already holding a group they play with often, or rude or inactive
---
Oh no, they knew to shoot it.. They just fucked up the placement and it blew up behind me :D
---
I just got a 150 for doing some board challenge. You don’t get much but you do get them.
---
No, I got the emote from the Atomic Shop at some point. But still. If things people buy there tend to disappear, then that may start to discourage people to use it further.
---
*Sad trombone noises*
---
i agree with ya. i also suspect the atomic shop will just have less stuff now too, in that they'll be planning for future seasons and saving stuff for the grind instead of just throwing it in the atomic shop.
---
Fixed it???
---
Yeah you needed a squad for sure. But I think that’s what made it fun. If you didn’t have a good squad, you were F’d. But that was the most fun we had in the game. After that left, my squad left.
---
I still have mine because I bought the Tricentennial.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1\_bWy1qpQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1_bWy1qpQA)
---
Yous sure about that?
---
Now I’m solo again
---
When the daily’s and weeklys were still atoms you got per day around 70-80 and weekly we’re about 70-80 per week
---
O thank god. Appreciate it. It’s already time consuming enough. They need to adjust that thing. Badly.
---
I think the whole SCORE thing was done on purpose to irritate players.
---
I could do Novice solo, but anything else was a nope from me... Almost managed to do the normal difficulty solo too, but I was 3 seconds away from finishing and it failed.
---
Is this confirmed? And I agree that it’s a honeymoon period. I wouldn’t be surprised if even within the next few days numbers start to drop.
---
It took me about 25 cemetary runs to find it.
---
It's more like if you're not an auto weapons user. 
---
Stealth commandos can still do some work but anyone with a low DPS just can't, no matter how hard your 1 single shot does. You don't do enough of them to make any real difference.
---
On the otherhand, you could probably single headshot a lot of scorched, animals etc.
---
It's the kind of thing I did when playing with lower levelled character and it felt pretty good because you're actually helping.
---
I tried but I couldn’t find anything related
---
So, you can reach lvl100 in 10 weeks without real effort. Thanks, you made my day better :)
---
They're are almost forcing you to become a slave or pay to unlock the last 10+ ranks using Atoms. Bethesda is really milking it good.
---
Teams don't aggro each other anymore tho. This is interesting. Gonna have to test it out.
---
None of the above. I just love the triple a title that these wonderful devs have given us.
---
Are you ignorant dumb stupid or not intelligent or do you just need a brain transplant
---
Yeah noc/lp/breathing wood left? Thats god roll right?
---
If you’re Xbox and looking for a teammate, well there’s no harm in breaking a new one in... I usually play solo or with my grandad, occasionally with a BoS cult.
---
Np, i didn't see this anywhere else but really wanted to know so while I was bored I wrote this up
---
Can say Gauss Shotgun still works in VATS. Whether 99% or 1% it still kills.
---
I never had to to it solo but I could imagine
---
Gonna make one everytime I log in!
---
To be honest I did the relatable earn 10000 xp one 4 times but only lvled up once... I'm only lvl 228 idk. I guess 40000 xp can only lvl up a lvl 227 once
---
I understand had I to replace my camp and delete the whole thing which was really annoying.
---
I also love this game. I thought I would hate it, talked shit about it for over a year. Finally tried it after Wastelanders, and I love it. And what I thought I would hate the most, the mmo aspect, has turned out to be my favorite thing. I don't like all the people all the time, I don't like all the atom shop stuff all the time, but I like far more about this game than I dislike.
---
But you’re still getting them. You’re blatantly lying to say you’re not.
---
Three god damned seconds, and I would have had it. If only that door didn’t get stuck forcing me to use the PA clip glitch.
---
Yup, mine is missing as well, no trace of it in the Atom Shop.
---
This is the truth and it will always be the truth. Bethesda is not only amazing but they are the top quality in regards to making video games and that can be proven with factual evidence like today’s update patch 20. 
---
Best triple a title ever
---
If SBQ fight gave 1k SCORE every time and every event have 200-500 ? That would make sense and very acceptable to reach lvl 100 before 10 weeks instead of grinding like crazy for that crap 100 SCORE repeatable.
---
I really don't feel like replacing my whole camp but I guess if I want it gone it has to be done. :/
---
It's not doubling ammosmith just the original amount. I've crafted from empty ammo to make sure
---
I’m not familiar with mmo lingo lol. What point were you making about it
---
Yea I agree there’s definitely some nice little bonuses like being able to fast travel to all team members camps and what not to incentivize people.
---
The exchange rate is stupid and the interface is one of the dumbest things ever.   How about you just enter how many of an item you have and then select what you want to convert it too?   Is that so hard?
---
I just wanted a damn machine to slowly transform ammo from one to another. Not some ammo pawnshop
---
Anyone that plays with grandad is a good dude in my book. I’m almost a grandad now lol. I am on Xbox. I was the guy giving away legendaries last week. I don’t play too often anymore but I’m not biased from playing with a new player. GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
I was expecting/hoping it was similar to Red Dead Online Outlaw Pass where any XP earned counts as S.C.O.R.E. It’s disappointing hearing how long/difficult current estimates are for reaching rank 100.
---
Yeah I understand I was rather upset when dealing with this and all I wanted to do was move the cabin like 5 feet over so that was depressing lol
---
In the auction house you can buy non PTW items to PTW items with money you grind in game
---
Do drugs maaaan
---
Why would you want to lie about it... of all things lol. 
---
It sucks and I know I didn’t get the points later because my boyfriend is higher rank than I am and he’s done less than I have. Makes no sense.
---
I’m not exactly new, I have a level 176 character. My alt is 48, and in 2 more levels I’ll be able to use my good gear :D
---
That's what i hate. I want to choose what i buy so i know I'll use it. I hate when games do this "we'll pick for you" bs
---
I couldn’t imagine doing the raids without the PA door glitch. It would be impossible
---
Must have touch of malice for kings fall. Fuck I need to catch up on some d2 raids...
---
In the auction house you can buy anything from PTW to non PTW with just in game money
---
Keep going while you're on a hot streak. I am still getting 1, sometimes 2 star pipes and pins from the Queen... BUT.....I almost fell off my chair when I got a 3* bloodied plasma from Uranium Fever tonight. I felt like I got stolen goods and just kind of quietly exited stage left...
---
I can tell you’re not new
---
On Novice it was alright, because you had the time to wait. On the other difficulties, no. Not a prayer.
---
So, were you at your camp when this happened? Cuz they were so successful fixing camp destruction that survival server camp turrets couldn't even be destroyed by players if the owner wasn't in the area. 
---
And team PvP is no longer a thing.
---
On the bright side, when the enemy gets stuck in a AI-less god state where they just stand there without reaction, it does open the doors for some fun photo opportunities.
---

---
What does that have to do with fallout 76
---
Thanks for the tip. I have edited the post accordingly.
---
the tricenennial pack says it has the vault boy salute, the one thats missing is different than that one
---
😂 
---
Mine is BlackClock69#660. I was drunk when I did that :/
---
You didn’t but it, that’s why it disappeared.
---
Oh then nevermind that, it was glitxh and no one was actually meant to have it in the first place.
---
I think they will probably add really good stuff to the atom shop, so we have to buy atoms to get the stuff we ‘really’ want. Otherwise this isn’t a cash grab at all since nobody will spend cash on anything.
---
I usually got a few legendaries on GM. Like, 2... rarely 3, sometimes 1, rarely none.
---
I just did it tonight and I had 5 on my side alone (I was only covering one side). Two spawned together on a single wave (that actually crossed from my side to the other side, first time I'd seen that too). 
---
So, yeah, from that 1 experience, it sure FELT like a lot more.
---
Same I though it was just me?
---
All you mention rather than having Todds dick 2 inches up my ass like you have ;)
---
Don't let the corn die haha. Hopefully this bug will be fixed as soon as possible lol.
---
For fucks sake. The thing isn’t meant for trading thousands of rounds. It’s the first day of release, it’s going to take forever to use it. It’s meant for small amounts of ammo you get from events and enemies, not hoards of it from your entire play through. It’s sad I even have to say this
---
Ooohhhh yes! Scalp ammo... Scalp Todd... SCALP THE SHAREHOLDERS!
---
We tried it to test it a few times. It was impossible even tho we knew what we were doing. Had it set up even. No freaking chance.
---
I was wondering what the hell was happening. Happened to me twice.
---
I’m sorry but you’re WAY off. It’s 220,275 total. Each level increases by 25 right? So in reality it goes (2-5) 25, 50, 75, 100, then (6-9) 125, 150, 175, 200. I did it the hard way by manually adding. The end result is not fun. The final level is about 3,500. With it constantly adding it gets out of hand fast. The numbers are bad. Really fucking bad
---
For balance reasons, it makes sense. I support it.
---
Omg. Holy cow that is one GT I’ve never seen lol
---
I’m not responding to you anymore your started by to give me a headach
---
This isn't r/atheism mate
---
That’s fucking gay and nobody needs to know about Todd sticking his pp up your ass. I have never done that and will never do that I am not gay like your 0 iq looking ass bitch
---
Fallout 1st and a fresh private server was essential if you wanted half a chance.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Yep agreed. We only did it on a private server
---
no
---
That’s because it’s not original but almost everybody else who had that name has been snitched, and either name scrambled or banned 😂
---
I'm glad I don't care about ANY of the rewards .
---
*spoiler* 
---
It doesn't. Ward was wandering around for me.
---
I hate to be the one to bust your bubble, but his math was off. Take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hizp05/you_can_not_afford_to_miss_any_score_challenges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Well, West Tek is not the only place to farm XP, as you can see in my SS scorched beast give a lot more XP than super mutants, and they have a fast respawn rate. Plus they seem to have a higher legendary spawn than super mutants. Personally, I no longer farm West Tek. Also, instead of White Spring, you may want to try The Burrows. 
---
Also, it factors in when you do your dailies and when you craft; any time you are getting XP, it is giving a bonus.
---
i wish they would actually. but, what 'really good stuff' is left to add to the game? just skins at this point isn't it? i mean the ammo converter is probably the most pined after potential atomic shop addition that players have been talking about/asking for since day 1.... and well, look how that turned out...lol
---
this was a different salute than the vault boy salute that the centennial pack says it has
---
This is why I go crazy when people say "Secret service power armor". Its so flipping confusing. There is secret service armor. And there is T65 power armor. Very different. Im sorry for your gold loss.
---
I made a post about this but don't forget the 1500 atoms they throw in the board that if you saved allows you to skip the last 10 levels for free. Also if your fallout 1st and don't care for the atoms thats another 10+ levels you can skip. And something else someone brought up underneath another post about this is most people doing this are high levels and if you have to level 3 times everyday anyway for challenges, the experience needed to make it to 100 will be made up through the repeatable.
---
Thank you...Gun Fu is on my list as well.
---
The servers are more stable now, although I don’t think they can handle a 94 style raid. It could barely do 79.
---
Thanks, sounds tedious but then again I'm not surprised.
---
This does not account for 25 more xp per tier. This calculates if all tiers cost 1025 except the first tier, which cost 1000. 
---
The correct calculation would be  Σ(n=1)-&gt;99(25 (n - 1) + 1000) = 220275
---
Sorry to break the news, but even if you did every daily and weekly challenge, you will still come up short on the last tier.
---
\+1 I saw this too and laughed. At Bethesda [/u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/)
---
Compared to how it was at launch you could consider its current state as fixed lol
---
I bought it. Even though I went through more steps to buy it than other, it doesn't make it any less valid.
---
Ever heard of these atom packs that come in 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 (+bonuses)? Yeah, those are also purchases.
---
Hm, I'll just open the front page of this subreddit and see how well this item worked.
---
I don't know, this is kind of like unlocking Nuclear Winter cosmetics. The stuff I care most about can actually  be unlocked before level 100.
---
150 gigs free, not enough space for the patch....
---
shit never ends.
---
Or ya know, make perk loadouts a thing already.
---
Oof! I thought I had it hard wanting the SS ghillie...
---
Thank you very much, I just got tired of seeing it and logged off .
---
When I did those I got em early when only 3/5 done with em
---
This post aged well.
---
If you didn't buy the Tricentennial edition you were never meant to have the emote, a bug caused everyone to receive the emote, this has now been fixed.
---
I didn’t have a problem with 79 at all. Game worked pretty fluid. All my issues came after. I think I’ve only been able to buy gold twice on two characters since it came out.
---
I have a feeling you're mixing up score with XP.
---
Also, you would have failed your math exam.
---
If what you said was true i.e. that you can complete the challenge in 4.766 weeks (let's round up to 5 weeks), by your own numbers
---
Daily = 2000 (per day) x 7 x 5 = 70k
---
Weekly = 7500 x 5 = 37.5k
---
Total = 107.5k
---
However, you got your original formula wrong. Y isn't 102,475. Y is 220275.
---
So by week 5, you're actually short 112,775.
---
Check the math. Who knows, I could be as much of a dumbass as you were.
---
I know you’re lying because a bug temporarily gave everyone access to the emote for free. Update 20 intentionally corrected that bug.
---
No matter what they add for someone with bloodied build will kill fucking everything they need the nerf tons of shit or add damage reduction to every enemy
---
Ward is still walking around Foundation for me lol
---
Ouch! At least I’ve been able to do *that...*
---
In the two hours I was able to play before work I made it to rank 7. It wasn't much fun, because I was JUST doing challenges. I know the rank requirements increase, so if this game is going to be "grind gold, scrip, score, grind grind grind" then I might be on my way out. I'll see how it plays out, but this looks like it was a good idea that was executed badly. Also the ammo converter isn't worth the build budget.
---
The only thing I care about as far as rewards go at 100 is the WILSON!!! mask. The main point however is this is much more grindy than a lot of other games with similar models. Hell, a few of them have a system where your missed challenges are retroactive and will loop back in if you miss them, aside from allowing more leniency on how much you have to do before you fall behind
---
what could it mean?
---
I always see shotgun users complaining about lack of shells, but I've had 1000 up for sale at 1 cap each for over a month now and no takers.  Are shotgun users all skint?
---
Unfortunately the season legendary run only added on to the chore list instead of lessened it. It's actually a small step in the wrong direction to fight off the lack of end game content. 
---
The worst part is its geared towards paying to complete the pass because if you miss a couple of days you essentially can not complete it.
---
Come on dude. This is terrible trolling. Have more respect for yourself. This is just embarrassing.
---
It’s always been that way
---
They brought out a machine that turns your useless ammo into ammo points that you can spend on ammo you do want. But they made it have a computer terminal and singular ammo box trading, meaning 1000 ammo will take an hour to trade in.
---
You do indirectly, they probably worded it bad. You earn extra score every 10000XP, which you mainly get from doing events
---
Yeah I’m still locked out. Tried it tonight. Last one I did it was several weeks ago. Submitted a ticket but no response as usual. Not that I care anymore. I have what I want now
---
Patch notes said nothing about this, so no offence but I don't buy it.
---
Private servers are the main draw.
---
Not that hard. I always did my daily an weeklies every single week since the game can out.
---
They need to lock him in an electrified cage problem is some1 would probly steal that too
---
Come on dude. Don't give Bethesda any ideas. They're liable to listen to our feedback and implement it but make it worse than what we requested.
---
Day 1 and I reached rank 10. 
---
Two weeks max before rank 100.
---
I was under the impression you can buy the mods now with the undate. You may need to go buy them.
---
Yep this. Haven't been able to bring myself to log in much. Super burned out on current content. Even the next DLC drop sounds like its only gonna be one new event..
---
Most of my IRL friends aren't gamers at all so getting them to play any game in the first place often requires a significant amount of intoxicants which is not cheap ;( And that's even if it wasn't the middle of covid-19 where hosting a party is not gonna happen, sigh.  
---
I'll be curious to see whether this new system helps... it seems like a +100% XP boost would potentially be a significant motivating factor. It's definitely much more motivating to me than the previous +15% XP boost you could get from being on a team with level 3 inspirational perk. Especially since it's now +115% XP with that perk enabled, if I'm understanding the system correctly.   
---
There seem to be some good people who are on PC at

---
Assuming not, but haven't tested.  Tried it was squad maneuvers as well and it didn't work.
---
Come on man lighten up a little. This is not good to hate on another studios art work. Have more respect for there piece of art. This is utterly dumb stupid embarrassing and idiotic and shouldn’t be excused. Bethesda lived up to there name with this magnificent update and will keep getting stronger.
---
Same here. Popped early.
---
The skins for the armor seem to be monthly, and they're not every month- This one's is some wood/leather/etc skins. Sometimes they're tent skins.
---
You know it's bad when I'm ready to go back to playing Final Fantasy XIV xD
---
Was about to post its not working but it seems known it isnt. Yea ur buff page was the dead indicator then a easy test was the confirmation
---
Sucks they broke this cuz honestly I use it in all my builds. I think any high.dps chaser does
---
Things I never knew I needed in my CAMP 😂😂
---
Fortunately if we are sure to let them know they screwed it up they will change it. I get putting some sort of limit on script and bullion (though I wish those were raised too) but common just 12 at a time? You know how many of us are overflowing with other ammo right now because we don’t like to waste stuff. It seems like they are worried that people buying the game a year from now will be at a disadvantage. That being said there are more current players than there will be new players at that time. So screw your potential future players. Worry about us not them.
---
Ive been getting 5-10k exp from scorched earth with all lunchboxes active and full bonded team. ive gotten 16 levels today.
---
Adding my name to the list of "this thing sucks."  What a horribly thought out idea all around.  This shouldn't even be its own thing.  It should just be another tab on the tinkering table.
---
Skins and camp items most likely, similar to the new hm skin quality. The gatling gun skin is great, I won’t hesitate to buy it with atoms right now instead of grinding weeks for it. I haven’t tried the ammo converter yet, sounds like it’s a disaster lol
---
I finished it anyway just so when it fnially stops being a broken mess ill get those points
---
Is that possible? Can they make it worse than it is? Lol
---
Bethesda: hold my beer
---
No one is seriously gonna use this. It will be another landmark in your camp like the fermenter. Just something that will sit there and do nothing
---
I lost 2,000 for the week.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
I didn’t receive the 1000 from killing various robots either. It’s marked as “complete” in my challenges, but it also remains tracked.
---
That’s nice, i haven’t got anything i can use yet from the drops, just the high percentage of three-star drops got my attention, there’s no way it’s just my luck or a good server, since it’s many servers and different creature types.
---
Hope the vertiguard skin comes out next atom shop refresh
---
I hope you are kidding, at higher levels you have so much valuable material to store. ( I have 1k of each flux) and 1st gives you UNLIMITED STORAGE!!!! The fast travel tent can be placed basically anywhere allowing you to store said junk. You get a bunch of atoms monthly, and finally the big one. Completely private worlds that are less buggy and prone to crash, places you can nuke and farm to your hearts content. All this for like $10 a month. It’s the deal of the century and completely worth it.....
---
I did all the daily and weekly and I’m at 10. I don’t think it’ll take that long unless when u get to the higher tiers it requires a fuck lot more exp which im not sure yet but yeah.
---
I've done this daily many, many times. There has never been a shovel there. Never. This person who was yelling at you is a douche and most likely always takes the shovel. May he waste an eternity of hours converting ammunition.
---
In other news, my tse handmade seems a little weaker than before.......anyone notice this?
---
I'm just pissed that you can't earn atoms anymore wtf Bethesda I'm losing faith in ya
---
The scrap box is such a clutch I honestly think I’d play without it.
---
So there's no weekly catch-up feature like litterally every other pass?  You have to play every day?  If so I'm def out.
---
I had a dream last night I was hand feeding a family of raccoons Doritos if that counts for anything. But yeah good idea
---
Lmao like why are they trolling soooooo hard wtf it’s like they like the taste of our tears
---
That mean the challenges given to you by the season (the previously none as atom-chalanges ones). The pop boy ones you are talking about are called daily quests. 
---
As for aluminium; I”be found that cafetaria are good (for the dinner trays), think about the cafetaria in the Charleston medical center (forgot the name, not in game right now..)
---
This character only wants one thing - Shielded SS underarmor.
---
Lol silly creation engine has no ladders
---
I keep forgetting about that. Thank you.
---
That they spend time on random junk and not releasing completed skins to the atom shop, The *screaming eagle* is atrocious
---
For some reason which I find extremely frustrating, hearing other people on voice chat is disabled by default AND on PS4 I have to manually enable hearing other people Every Single Time I start the game.   
---
It's under settings &gt; audio &gt; chat.
---
\+40 carry weith from Grilled Radstag. It was +20 before this patch.
---
I Used to buy atoms when needed... Then I took an Season to the knee
---
Did they give us mods. I bought that first but couldn’t mod it
---
Yeah.. by the junk yard across from poseidon, this sucks.
---
This execution is actually more stressful on the servers than a single transaction barter window
---
I think it is so you can fast travel there now even if you dont own it...
---
In Patch 20, for sure. But that’s locked behind more bullion. 200 for the underarmor plan, 250 for shielded.
---
Yup, I crash by poseidon, and since it loads you where you last were, I can't play the game basically. 1 character main, lvl 1310, can't play..
---
Goddamn kettle in Tea Time was swarming with people. I think there was at least two dudes for one spawned creature. Otoh, I've done like 5 server swaps in a row just to have my CAMP.
---
Use TAB to go back to the previous menu, it can help a bit, but interface is horrible. Looks like they don't have UX specialist
---
I went and fetched those paper targets for that darn robot for nothing.
---
He got 8 legendaries, the best are Bloodied Tesla Rifle and Explosive LMG.
---
I completed it but I never got the 1000 points
---
Lol they just immediately leave after they get a kill pathetic as fuck also there's always someone willing to pvp at scorched earth
---
Oh I have a ton of bullion to get rid of lol. Guess I need to get it now
---
Funny, all my friends were laughing at me cause I don’t spend atoms. Buy some wallpaper they said, maybe a silly hat. Never bought any or specifically did the daily’s. I do have 1st though. Just checked and I have almost 30k atoms. Who’s laughing now.....
---
It's difficult for teammates to have much of a negative impact on camps at this point even in private teams. The ability to delete stuff was removed, which is annoying for the group of people who liked to be "hired" to do camp remodels for other people and etc, but also protects other people from the rare griefer. I've been teaming up with random people on private teams for a really long time on PS4 though and maybe every 1/1000 of those times was a person who wanted to try to mess with me (and usually failed for one reason or another, heh)
---
450 billion well spent if you want 15 DR ER RR and 4 strength, 2 perception, and 4 endurance
---
Get a lever and prime it. Get your hits in for rewards.  And spend the interim time murdering the mobs with head shots.
---
They really made the world map harder to read. I can’t hardly find my camp anymore
---
Well shit. I’m in
---
Someone prove me wrong but this isnt a thing. You had a visual glitch or somethung.
---
Anytime, happy hunting!
---
Always been that way super duper doubles the base recipe amount not affected by perk cards that increase this. Disappointing I know but by no means anything new.
---
Most of the weekly pop up early, so at 3/5, so you did not lose points, you got it early and it will not give it a second time if you finish the task.
---
Challenge vs quest
---
In addition to all this, the Purveyor has a ranged pool of 44-51 weapons depending on which plans you know. There are 22 prefix effects. So you have, at best, a 1/990 chance of getting a Bloodied Fixer from her. Start saving your caps and scrip now so you can make a package deal on one of the trading markets.
---
Do you have film for the camera?
---
I don't think you can sell items for scrips in player vendors, script would be a lot more of a popular of a currency If that were the case. Might be some sort of new exploit
---
Do you have chat audio enabled + are you stopping by their location and then saying hi on the mic? Cuz I always have a mic but I may or may not speak if not spoken to first, depending on my mood ;)
---
Honestly the 100 score per 10k XP isn’t that bad, most high level enemies offer 100 to 200xp each, I’ve gotten 100 score about 5 times so far tonight and I’ve only been playing for a few hours.
---
Yea more than enough
---
It's showing scrip as currency in my vendor machine too. Maybe I'm getting an extremely weird glitch.
---
the front sight isn't even functional, your bullets hit waaay under it
---
Yeah, that is kinda why I made the post. It kinda annoyed me that the workshops now all have a unique icon and it makes fast identification harder. But I know why they did it *To Kill The PVP community,* It no longer shows what workshops are owned so people cannot use them to force PVP anymore.
---
Yea, it's been this way since 2018 :)
---
Yea I am not even gonna bother with the thing for this reason, let alone place it and waste budget on it lol. Crafting ammo with max level ammo smith and super duper is 1000x more efficient and faster
---
If the stairs are connected to anything else you'll have to remove that first. You may want to try placing a ramp flooring to the porch so it's connecting to the ground, remove the stairs, then rotate the ramp so that can then be removed. If the stairs are alone you'll have to move camp :(
---
I did. All posts are either ammo converter feedback and overall SCORE EXP issues.
---
Let's hope it's a glitch because that would be a dangerous explains/hack
---
I didn't know that. I only started playing in February.
---
Keep it.
---
The Ammo converter is terrible! How did they manage to screw up with something so simple!
---
The transition to Fortnite is progressing well.
---
Oh shit I didn’t even notice I just thought no one was taking them anymore lol. Interesting.
---
I noticed when I ran RR and didn't get any damage increase. I had to try it a couple of times during the event to make sure it was indeed a bug. Hope they fix this soon as it may not be limited to that specific perk...
---
I needed this laugh
---
Why would you drop that? The patch has nothing to do with this. Search the sub for examples of paper sack drops gone bad. Always transfer important things in a container or f2f.
---
Not as good as the shielded raider underarmors for a rifleman/commando stealth build, because they give +3 perception and +3 agility. Although for a melee character you won’t get anything better than that, specially if you use Nuka Dark with Cola Nut and Party Girl... +6 str and end just off the Dark. +3 str and end from psychobuff, then +4 str and end from the underarmor is + 13 of each. Broken.
---
as someone who’s main is a high level stealth rifleman I can definitely say we have a huge impact on the SBQ fight. Just not in a noticeable way compared to the harder hitting builds. We keep the big suits of steel alive and kicking. The less they have to turn their attention to the mobs, the better they can do in the fight. 
---
Some tips:
---
Once you get your damage in on the queen. Start dropping the mobs. Shoot whatever you can find but your biggest target should be mirelurk kings/queens,  feral ghouls and scorched. 
---
Scorched are annoying but not as big a priority.  mirelurk kings and ghouls hit like tanks and can really screw up the heavy gunners. so those should allways be high priority targets. 
---
Looking at some of the comments it would appear your using a handmade. Don’t ditch it. Semi auto versions of the handmade are great for clearing out weaker enemies and saving the better ammo for harder enemies. your main should be a lever action, a fixer or a hunting rifle using .50 cal receiver and one of the armor piercing magazines.  
---
If you don’t have the Chinese stealth suit. Get it as soon as you can. Its not a necessity but it definitely gives stealth rifleman some extra protection during the the queen fight. 
---
Your long term goal should be to get you an instigating legendary rifle preferably lever action but anti armor is good as well. I ran around with an explosive lever action for a long time and when i landed my instigating lever action  i was blown away. 
---
Definitely don’t give up. Its easy to get discouraged because the queen is a bullet sponge and it feels like your not doing anything. I felt like that when i started playing  stealth rifleman . with enough practice you’ll find yourself having a blast during the fight.
---
Switched servers, same thing. It also looks like it pulled from my scrip, not caps, when I bought the items.
---
Are there finally mods for the under armor? What do the mods do?
---
Agreed. The ammo converter is a really bad joke at this point. We should be able to scrap ammunition, like we've fucking asked for, for over a year now.
---
Yup, Bethesda seems very interested in wiping out *PVPers,* Not that i'm complaining not I can actually use workshops
---
It was implemented this way to stop dupers from using it as a tool for duping.
---
It is also simple and easy to understand. Find the ingredients. Start the machines. Protect the machines by shooting everything. When the alarm goes off fix the issue and go back to shooting things.
---
eyyyup, gotta move camp then.
---
Nope, took from caps. Sorry for the scare haha
---
I don’t know how any one not heavy weapons build does SB. I certainly don’t even waste my time
---
Loadouts or no loadouts i'd still like to see this introduced
---
That scares me a bit, I have to get script daily because if modules for armor and that's not a good glitch
---
On PS4 they do. I sell most of my ammo for 1c with the exception of .45 and 5.56 which I sell for 2c. They fly off the shelves at 2c. I can't keep 'em in stock unless I wanted to devote the entirety of my gaming to manufacturing ammo.   
---
Ammo is the most reliable source of "income" from my vending machines in general. Nothing else sells as quickly and reliably. I assume people are terribly bored of everything related to crafting ammo. I know I am -- I ditched both my characters who used guns and have been playing my unarmed character for quite some time now.
---
Got that same as well. But since it didn't clear out the challenge I proceeded to complete it and got nothing... now I'm scared to verify if this might bug out challenges down the line while actually trying to complete them...
---
I have challenges checked off, but the score points aren't being given to me. At this rate, even if I do all the challenges I still won't reach level 100
---
Fortnite apex legends and modern warfare do battle passes right. 
---
I can finish warzone with almost an entire month to spare and the exact same thing for apex legends. I have so much of a gap in these two battle passes that I can do them both at the same time.
---
Not to mention warzone gives out free pass tiers when the battle pass is ending just if you're struggling. P
---
The terminal is the ultimate device that never was. I installed it so I can look at it and shake my head as I walk out my camp door to battle. It's not as if we couldn't get an active list of events or quests or anything.... 
---
It implies I have no friends other than two boyloving scout leaders and a drunk frat robot who can't admit he has a problem.
---
No
---
Gave me a heart attack lol, looks like a visual glitch. It displays my scrip count where caps should be, and then all the vendor items in scrip instead of caps. But then buying with the 'scrip' pulls from caps.
---
Also need to mention it’s just an M16...
---
The community is right here, quite obviously not enjoying it.
---
Happy cake day!!
---
They could introduce a new currency based on a new metal “Tedium”.
---
Yeah you can join and drop as you will. I created a team and a minute later it was full. Then people dropped as they swapped servers or jumped to other teams, but somebody else would quickly take their place.
---
I feel like it needs to be made less tedious- I just ended up dumping all the excess ammo I have been picking up the last few weeks for this. It’s not worth the time fiddling with the menus. I’d rather buy ammo at this point
---
This game gets a lot of deserved criticism. However, one thing that is consistently great is the sound design. You're right about those tokens. Perfect! Eating ancient moldy hotdogs? So gross! Little muffled words and scratchy legs in a cave? Scary! 
---
Big kudos to the sound team.
---
Can’t say it did. I got SCORE for every challenge I completed. Only one I didn’t get was the NW challenge and didn’t level up three times for the weekly.
---
I'm not familiar with Xbox but can't you guys get in a party or something.
---
solution:
---
build another foundation and connect it with floors to the unremovable stairs
---
It is a visual glitch from nw
---
Well they certainly could invest that energy in making BR actually something that’s not a joke.
---
I actually got my camp reward half way through doing it.  I’m wondering if you take over a camp that already has things built if that screws up tracking.
---
Except you don't have to worry about friends fucking around in your camp now
---
Had the same problem, moved my camp somewhere else then dropped the bugged foundation with stairs and was able to scrap, then moved back to my original location and had to rebuild everything, sigh...
---
We know from what they said in the new IGN sog interview that patch 22 with the one wasteland rebalance will be in the fall, so the earliest September. Then patch 21 will likely be one to one a half months away from today if it slots inbetween the patches.
---
I Dunno, it was doing that before patch 20 for me.
---
Started around patch 19, screen all blurry like the distance blur is wrong
---
Or just add a not BR pvp mode, Like team deathmatch with prechosen non legendary weapons
---
Yes they are. Your just hating on a a perfect game. You don’t know a work of art when you see it. Stop complaining and start loving
---
I've noticed it too. It feels like it ain't the only booster that's broken.
---
.50 cal with 50% ignore armor and extra damage. Adrenaline, bloody mess and everything maxed on heavy guns + booster drugs and I did 2 in damage on scorched queen 🤬
---
He "dropped it back"
---
My favorite part
---
Oh that's not to bad
---
I don't think we can. My fallout 1st was going to charge today and I just cancelled my sub. I'll keep it cancelled until we get Survival mode back.
---
Crazy right lol 
---
You know I think a moba style mode could be fun.
---
Not per week  in a month is I was doing them all I was makeing a few thousand now every month and a half I’m gonna get 500
---
Dropped it right into oblivion
---
When you look at the weekly challenge, click on it and it opens up a sub menu telling you what you need to complete the week. You only need to take one workshop and then build what's required, I remember some of the tasks were build 10 water/food sources, 20 lights and a generator, 10 containers, build a door. Sorry can't remember them all
---
hahah i enjoy that a bit tho, i build very practically and my friends make it colorful
---
Did anyone really expect this wouldn't be a massive grind and cashgrab?
---
Just Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
If you have a stack of aluminum you can make bulk aluminum at a tinkers bench. From there you can scrap the bulk aluminum and rinse repeat to complete quest.
---
Pretty sure it was one of the secondary teams that did a lot of the work, Todd’s team was just kinda there
---
Please no, make it 1000 to make events even more worthwhile. Somebody reported getting 1000 SCORE from SBQ but due to the glitchy state of challenges it's not confirmed.
---
Lucky you. I've jumped in Encryptid just to find a bunch of high-levels (200+) doing pew-pew from the roof and one guy who tried to activate the pylons, so I had to take two other pylons (full stealth perks + chinese costume makes wonders here, btw). The imposter was put down really fast but I still don't get the fact that out of 20 guys ONE dude and I had to activate pylons.
---
He was trade menu glitched and had to get off soon. Bad call on my part for sure. Luckily I have extras.
---
I’m gonna go ahead and agree with you AND say my girl (me) likes https://youtu.be/iWa-6g-TbgI
---
I couldn't mod the under armour I'd previously crafted, so I crafted a new under armour and modded that which worked for me.
---
If they could just give us:
---
- A better interface for this
---
- **Fucking sliders**
---
- And a better trading window
---
We’d be set.
---
I would recommend submitting a ticket to Bethesda customer is support then. They should be able to look up which version you had of the game and hopefully restore your salute.
---
lol you even get christmas stuff unlocked...
---
It is okay, but on an overpopulated server, it is difficult to farm any location.
---
And the exp getting from crafting is negible. I agree with you that in the case that I am focusing on just killing it is much better... But not for a lot of the playerbase, that they do not push as hard as you.
---
And it is not our fault, it is devs that designed the exp gaining and looting this way. Because I am not getting exp, not even a percentage on my teammates kills unless I could tag efficiently, nothing you can do on a public team of randoms. 
---
So building groups are the antisystem, because you create them just to go alone to a location and farm by yourself or with another reliable peer and forget about the rest of the ppl on your group. Does that sound as a team?
---
I think that events are more team focused and well designed, allowing a more relaxed gameplay.
---
I am hoping it's for something new, like that old scorchbeast design that was recently found in game stuck to a giant wall. If you don't know what it looks like, here's the link.
---
[Here](https://external-preview.redd.it/JjsI1IXVQT7tufcT14s_p8g3ItBLGvO__1j8wLuGAxw.png?auto=webp&amp;s=87a3efb7e6501194ab0f1119a853ca1819f94890)
---
Honestly this looks pretty cool to me and I'd like to see an alive one added as a new boss, one that doesn't require a nuke zone and one that has steps similar to the Imposter Sheepsquatch. I mean the real Sheepsquatch is cool and all and I love seeing it randomly in the Wasteland and this creature should appear randomly as well but I'd love to see an event for it.
---
Like maybe don't make it spawn in the world until the player has attempted the event, success or failure doesn't matter.
---
All I have gotten all day was 1 Star
---
Not from what the interviews mentioned. If you go back and watch interviews with Todd and Pete they'll talk about how they were play testing in house and having little games of it every day.
---
Either I'm not catching what you're saying or it's not working properly
---
Just noticed this but annoyingly you cannot fast travel to workshops for free anymore
---
Mirelurk Kings and ballistic Mr Gutsys. By far.
---
Upvote for visibility!
---
Should a casual player get every reward? What would be there for the more serious players? There are quite a few games I don't have everything unlocked because I play casually. Why does everyone want everything? Just be happy you have something to do.
---
And yet we still don’t have and new hairstyles
---
Yeah that’s what I mean the higher people were testing but it was some secondary studio that actually developed the game
---
I thought you were done talking
---
Precursor messages to the upcoming return of the Brotherhood of Steel and they are 5 messages in totally all coded differently but the PTS dataminer community already decipher all of them. Watch this video if you feel like it you know what the messages mean or say note potential spoilers got upcoming Fall/Winter DLC:  https://youtu.be/l43kBf8b4fw
---
That’s great but what about poor nocturnal in the corner crying
---
I've been getting a small amount of points from events like 200 or so - hard to tell. Don't know if this is part of the calculations. I was on an events public team.
---
See I think the opposite, I think Bethesda will start pushing some amazing items eventually in the atom shop once our free supply of atoms start to run out or have run out.
---
Knowing we can't easily replenish them now because daily/weekly have gone in favour of the seasons, our only option is to buy atoms to get them.
---
This was the whole point of the seasons, yeah we'll get some cosmetics doing them but all the nice stuff will be still behind the atom shop and they have took away the majority of the free atoms so it increases bought ones
---
If they allowed everyone to get 1000 SCORE from every event completed, everyone would finish the whole thing in a week.
---
The ammo converter is absolute trash unfortunately. 
---
Casuals will NOT be able to just casually hit rank 100 without spending $$$, actually no one will with how the points are working currently. 
---
Idk about others but I’ve lost most of my emotes? Like I no longer have my salute and some others.
---
The Screaming eagle paint is literally just an M16, and instead of making a new weapon instead they went with the cheap route and made it a skin.
---
No new content (because legendary perks and the wendigo boss fight got delayed).
---
Half finished, abandoned systems and partially re-inventing the wheel are Bethesda's MO
---
Worst part is that people will actually do it and Bethesda knows it. These people would suck Todd Howard's dick for a chance to show off something unique in game because they think it makes them special.
---
This absolutely. 
---
 Its yet another way theyve nerfed the good bits of the game into the ground. 
---
We lose 5000 atoms and are now forced to be rewarded with whatever they decide to give us. I dont need scrap kits or armor cosmetic or caps. I liked earning my atoms, usually enough to get one bundle a month or so, and being able to pick what I wanted. 
---
Theyve pretty much taken every benefit weve had in this game and nerfed it or monetized it.
---
Hahah, hilarious :D thanks
---
Yes, oh my good Lord, this thing is trash.  They need to shit-can the terminal and change it to an ammo scrapper with the same interface as everything else in the game.
---
I agree that ganking a single player with a full team needed to be stopped, there needs to be a way for teams that want to fight to be agro against each other
---
Not super rare. Worth maybe 4-5k caps for the set
---
I forgot Bethesda levitates above the rest of us .. I'm so glad they are choosing what's valuable for me now ...
---
Before this I was earning atoms just casually playing .. slowly over time they built up and I chose my reward from the atom shop
---
Now to earn them or move through the season I have to open and check dailies/weeklies to get a reward Bethesda now chooses for me
---
Their feels are not my feels, I liked it the way it was
---
Where do you find it?
---
I claimed it but didnt see it in my inventory
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards
---
Don't know what's available with this bug. But there are more Xmas rewards
---
When I do this daily - I usually do use the shovel next to the grave. However, when I am done I just drop it in a bag for the next person.
---
Let me put it this way.. At least a do not need to delete anything in my C.A.M.P in order or build this useless piece of junk. That’s as much positivity as I can muster.
---
U get them from regs
---
Just now? Where the fuck have you been the 2 years?
---
Constantly rechecking the challenge menu is tedious indeed. Great idea!
---
Which bot sells sweet rolls?
---
Shielded and from regs
---
Ty dude
---
I’ve read
---
4 s
---
2 p
---
4 e
---
From three star enemies?
---
PREACH. Can't wait to see CM chiming in on someone sharing a \*totally real\* feel good story about how they love building CAMPS
---
Uh, yes you can?
---
Yep just got em
---
I think you’re confused
---
Awww, it's sad to think that many people might not venture into the camp I spent many hours carefully creating &amp; decorating because of a few people who made boring punji board trap camps. (I love well designed trap camps.)   
---
Would having a visible stash box next to the door make any difference? I typically never use the normal stash box because I dislike how it looks and it ruins the aesthetic... but if having an ugly generic stash box out front would decrease the chances that someone would leave, I'd do it, heh.   
---
There's no way I'm leaving my vendors outside in the rain. I didn't spend all that time grinding for atoms to get themed decorations so that I could just slap a few things on the ground. The food vendor goes in the bar, the gun vendor goes in the weapons room, etc. Or, y'know, whatever other roleplay equivalent for the camp's theme.
---
Both are pretty well junk imo. Fat man's are garbage no matter what. And a 1* pip isn't worth much. Some people like the bolt/revolver since they can double dip pistol and rifle perks. But most people want a bloodied or junkies with explosive or ffr
---
And now again in English…
---
Devs play this game by starting a new character in each play session. They spend the first half of their playtest designing their character.
---
I've learned that on 3/5 of the weekly, it automatically activates and gives you score.
---
What do you mean? I thought u could gain xp for the bored by playing public events
---
What, you don't want eight ghilli suits??
---
No level 100 for me then. Oh well no loss is it. Thanks Todd.
---
FASCHNAT COLLECTRON P2W PLS NERF
---
This game is why I took up drinking
---
When I logged in the under armor in my inventory was already modded but I didn’t know the plans for the upgrades and the modded under armor didn’t have me any buffs. So I just scrapped it bought the plans and modded a new one
---
Stop being part of the problem.
---
Higher tier rewards
---
The little cafe right next to the toy store.
---
You can,  but its random.  Also say xp or score but stop using then interchangeably.
---
Yeah, all the 0/5 awarded the 1000 at 3/5 instead.
---
I carry a second set of legendary armor which I use when I need to fast travel. It all has weight reductions for various things and ends up being a bigger benefit than the +200lb excavator boost. Switching armor is faster / easier than switching perk cards...
---
I'm sorry but between 1st and the ATX this is how the game lives. I don't know shit about a lot of things in this world, but the minute I saw how easy it was to earn atoms in-game I knew a day would come where the tap would be turned off, or turned down. 
---
With the measures taken to bring the game up, those costs are passed to the consumer sometimes in subtle and slow ways. We got wastelanders free after all. A lot of work to this point has been for only like a $12 base game... 
---
From here forward I believe you'll see a rash of packs and bundles of shit you'll want- and truthfully you'll probs be chipping in your own cash. I really think the atom store is gonna see some drastic shit within 12 months, and yes it'll be while atoms can barely be earned in game. 
---
I came from ESO and you can't earn fucking any crown store credit AT ALL. 
---
I can't fault Beth and they're doing what it takes to keep the product alive and growing. Nothing comes free sadly. 
---
Just earn what you can, where you can. Remember--these are all optional cosmetics and won't impact your ability to play (fuck i hope they stay cosmetic).
---
Sweet!
---
Yeah. No. For one, I had to quit a server mid fight to cancel god mode post patch.
---
Still riding the high from Oblivion.
---
I got better when will patch 23 be out .
---
Its giving them out early for me. Once i did 3 of the 5 i got the points. Check your score maybe you already got it.
---
This should absolutely be a vending machine with currency, not this disaster.
---
Man, if only there were a machine that could create ammo out of thin air for us that we could then convert!
---
Because consoles.
---
I had this too. Some say it's paying out mid challenge. Others say not at all. My thought is there may be some newly built redundancy that checks against what you've done and what is needed. It may catch up. But I did notice some oddities myself.
---
Take screenshots of each set of daily and weeklies finished. Just in case we need to prove it.
---
Wait a minute, the SCORE you need is increased by 25 every time? I thought it was 1,000 SCORE every level to 90 and then the last 10 levels was 2,000 SCORE.
---
Surely this can not be how they did it. I mean Rockstar's Outlaw Pass for RDR2 in like 1200XP every single level, never with an increase. I thought Bethesda was doing the same thing except doubling the SCORE needed towards the end.
---
Ultracite .308 gang 😎
---
Open it near other players and gives them a 25% XP boost.
---
You can see it while leveling. At this moment I’m aware of no cap off though I’m desperately hoping there is
---
They also stack. 3 of those clustered together is like infinite stimpaks.
---
I did :/
---
missing the thousand. Should be most of the way through lvl5
---
...Apparently. Who woulda thunk? What's the next thing we should mass report about that they will likely get to? I know that's a hard question to ask, but...ya know. Might as well try.
---
Something is definitely off. I've noticed too.
---
thank you sir,  
---
\*sigh\*  
---
Skyrim, here we go again.  
---
:D
---
It really surprises me that there aren't more generator skins. I have one of the few options available and they still look pretty crappy. Even with the fusion generator, I still typically hide it behind walls for aesthetic reasons even when that isn't necessary to protect it from harm.
---
I believe the old adage that says, "if it sounds too good to be true than it probably is" applies here.
---
I have no proof but sounds like it to me. No one should have any reason to refuse a courier..
---
Being linked into a team just offers a team wide perk. Don't really need to do anything together just need to be together to get the additional perk.
---
There has to be a cap very early on. That would be absolutely ludicrous, if not.
---
It dosent make it to 100% no matter how much of it you stack. I've tried a fair few ways.
---
The only way to get to 100% fall damage reduction is from x2 50% reduced fall damage legendary effect.
---
Yeah but it looks cool and allows you to build things other than tons of water pumps on a river! :D
---
You got it when you crafted three out of the five.
---
Or give us a companion app with them on, if nothing else.
---
I've never heard of them (XB1). Sounds like they are to me. Tell them to put up first, if they still won't, block them.
---
Shhhh theyll fix this if we talk about it lol
---
Not sure... But what about the atom points??
---
Yknow, a placeable on-fire dumpster for your camp would actually be a great
---
I think the armor takes off 50% of the remaining 15% after the goat legs kicks in. So really it's only 92.5% reductions? Or it's a "feature"...
---
I mean, christ give them some credit they gave us an ammo converter.
---
Pro tip - stop being the reddit police ,nobody but you enjoys it
---
will do
---
You 100% got it at 3/5 and the atoms is a visual glitch. They got added to your total without showing the pop-up.
---
LOL, I carry a lvl 45 3* iFSSrw shovel just for BwH... Knocks out those lvl 12 mongrels like the dog catcher!!!
---
alternatively, it may have caught up on before.....i dunno
---
This happened to my friend
---
"It's not so bad.  With enough effort we could turn this place into a piece of crap." -Louis Griffin
---
All the 0/5 challenges awarded score at 3/5 for some reason.
---
Dang thats rough haha, I'll have to hope RNG favors me with the next few SS pieces I craft! Thanks for clarifying, its never a lot of damage but it'd be nice to not have to worry about any at all :)
---
Gameboard/season is fine, imo. But the converter is trash and I don’t even have that much ammo to spare.
---
I’ve shown up to it a couple times recently and there’s been a shovel in a paper sack on the ground right next to the grave... There’s always one resting across the flower pot right outside of the Morgantown train station if anyone ever needs it
---
If they added them to your pip boy boy as an extra thing after events and then tracking yea that would save time 👍
---
So the fact that the building supply one bugged on me and went to my completed list after completing 5/8 tasks but the game labeled it as 5/5 has totally fucked me then. Neat. 
---
To be fair, the kill robots one gave me a reward and moved to completed when I had three eyebots left....so neat?
---
I purchased it for atoms on it's own as I didn't have and was jealous. Now it's gone.
---
🤣🤣
---
Tbh I'm not even bothered with the terminal... what I am bothered about is the horribly small bundles we can scrap for ammo points.... I mean like 18 10mm rounds.. really??? Why can't we bulk it in steps of 100/250/500/1000 depending on the conversion rate.... 
---
Other than that it will take a week to convert all the ammo.... I'm actually sort of glad we finally have a better purpose for our ammo than dropping it in front of vault 76 or at the whitesprings xD
---
I purchased on it's own as well.
---
this is why all those items value has dropped a little recently, still the drop chance of the jumpsuits, like you're supposed to get one jumpsuit but you get all of them and both masks
---
I'm a new player and I used to hear it was rare from streamers and youtubers. I completed Encryptid like 5 times and I got 2x Imposter sheepsquatch outfit 1x  Sheepsquatch mascot outfit and 1x Imposter sheepsquatch helmet.
---
Do not be fooled by this new account. This "new" Redditor is a blacklisted scammer with the PSN tag SeCXtual\_Snorlax. AND is also very good friends with this TenPenny fellow mentioned.. who happens to be blacklisted on FB trading hubs.
---
Most people I played with have been sitting on atoms and not using them. Atom grinding became tedious and boring and many have stopped doing them entirely (I know some still did and sure will see many yell at me saying they did). The new system skips atoms all together and gives you something for the work. I've seen a huge increase in people grinding events as a result.
---
I like the new daily/weekly incentive. Feels like I'm actually getting something for the work vs 10 cents worth of atoms.
---
That could totally be it too! Dang, I'll have to grind out another piece of reduced fall damage armor!
---
It is a one in a million drop chance. Count yourself lucky. Has always been like this.
---
Only if they made it so that bulk scrap isn't classed junk.
---
At first when I was sitting there spamming X converting .38 rounds to points I thought “Well this isn’t that bad, spam X for 2 minutes to get max 2000 points.” Then I turned it in for 556 rounds... 200 points for 20 bullets. 
---
I give the machine 1800 .38 rounds and get 200 556 rounds back. That just doesn’t seem right...
---
But I guess now there’s a use for the useless mini nukes, grenades, and missiles that gets forced on me during quests.
---
(Honestly the start of this comment I was going to complain about the converter like everyone else, then halfway through I realized I can turn in explosive ammo and the arrows and crossbow bolts I often get but don’t use into 556, now I’m actually pretty happy over this thing, so disregard my whinging at the beginning.)
---
I was watching the public teams all day today, and I would see 2 to 3 event teams in a lot of the servers, and yet when I checked the map for events, I saw very few to none doing the events. Sometimes for certain public events people showed up, but for the most part people just seem to be using the public teams for the group bonus you get from mutations and charisma perks. So, I don't feel your "antisystem" concern is isolated to any one public team type.
---
Told ya, don't hype over bethesdas updates you'll probably get disappointed, start with low expectations and either you'll prove them right or get a happy surprise. I started with low expectations and in all fairness the ammo converter is far from useless in my opinion, the UI a bit annoying but better than having a ton of unused ammo for whatever reason
---
i noticed this too...but it is the first day.
---
Joined a few events teams...no team chat but we split into two groups of two...after three worlds finally met a good group dropped a nuke traded stuff...
---
Think your forgetting about the repeatable score award for getting xp too. they’re giving everyone team xp bonuses of 100% for a full team which has been easy to find and it’s really easy to get enough Co to unlock score. I did 3/4 daily challenges so far and 2-4 weekly and I’m level 12
---
I had not gone herbivore until I saw this was added today. Herbie all the way, and meat for vendors only. bye bye butcher perk.
---
Half the time when I do this it goes into completely random menus, often buying instead of selling. I haven't tried on a controller though.
---
No one, and I mean no one, is buying 40mm grenades or .38, among others.  There is no vendor market for half of the ammo in this game.
---
It's because after 2 weeks u can just buy the score with atoms
---
Or just give us a slider like when we sell to vendors
---
Nope.
---
They could easily make money on this game by actually making it fun.
---
Been experiencing issues too all day.
---
Had to restart Xbox everytime to fix the problem.
---
I did lucky mucker today, dross toss and chow line yesterday... Different toons obviously
---
Ps4 here...Mine is working. Curious how others arent
---
Yeah was super stoked for it until I got it. Very disappointed. Figured I could just got hey take my 200 shotgun shells and give me my points. Then let me buy 100 .45 rounds or something. Hell the conversion rate sucks too. Not even a 2:1 ration. Best to sell it at my vendor or just start dropping/not picking it up again
---
Actually at some point holding the back button is also an endless loop. You actually have to select “return to main menu”. You can’t make this up.
---
I only do that when his dumb ass gets trapped on some rocks.
---
Do they know how to make a game fun? Did they major in grinding at university?
---
But traps aren’t gay though
---
You on Xbox? If you are I will bug those off you
---
Because you shot back
---
In VATs? They fixed the fully charged bug for it.
---
Oh no. If only someone had seen this coming.
---
Then don't go to camps.
---
I don’t think it a question of whether the Devs play the game. 
---
There’s a business model for this game that doesn’t involve producing the best game possible. The arbitrary limits in weight, script, caps, bullion are there to ensure players play little and often. This helps control the load on Servers and stretches out the FO1st subscriptions. 
---
Were they to introduce a system that easily converts (or sells) ammo this would impact Bethesda’s expected playing style. Overnight playing weight would change potentially losing FO1st members. 
---
I believe the Devs are walking a line between the game the players want and the business model that the investors want. So in this example the Devs give the community something that they have requested but make it so tedious and laborious so to reduce its impact on the business model.
---
Il be honest I didn't even know there was a VATS bug for it, I'm just running from the base damage you see in the pipboy
---
What platform you on? Would love to get those .45 rounds. What do you use?
---
My guess....
---
confuse players xD xD xD 
---
It is nothing but a weird novelty animation.... and does absolutely nothing but confuse us xD
---
Pc sorry otherwise It'd be good
---
Can confirm!
---
Plus you get XP - and you need as much of that as you can get to level up your SCORE
---
I know, thx tho
---
Or someone who was ordered to waste as much of the player's time as possible, which is probably what happened here.
---
Really should be heavy and non heavy. High ballistic are mostly .50 cal 5mm and such
---
How do you buy levels with atoms? So if i have a large wad of atoms I can be at level 100 today, is that how it works? I didn’t find a ‘buy level with atoms’ Button anywhere.
---
Same, though I should of known it was too good to be true being such an early unlock.
---
It does make me wary about grinding for other items now.
---
Rock and a hard place.
---
Yeahhhhhhhhh I’m done with this game...
---
We got a reply for one thread on a cosmetic item from the Atom Shop when we've always known that the skins are a disaster, yet the whole sub is full of people telling Bethesda that the person who designed the ammo converter is some kind of Jigsaw level sadist and nothing.
---
Yeah would be nice or if have to make it be it’s own bench but it should work better,faster and a little bit for efficient too the ration for ammo sucks
---
I'd say dropped it straight into his stash box.
---
Not really give it a cap and make it 5% per mutation and make it go up to 50% BAM, insta buff and now mutants is a good prefix again
---
There is a thread where they are compiling all the bugs and this has been confirmed, the Challenge still requires 5/5 to clear from the challenges screen, but the reward is given at 3/5. I only noticed coz I put all the SCORE Challenges on Tracked, so saw it popping SCRore at 3/5 on side of screen.
---
I noticed that now it takes me more shots to kill anything with gauss shotty, i thought it was just me.
---
Not gonna lie, a lot of people really seem to be overreacting. Eat relish, inspirational, and well rested alone are a ~30% exp boost. Then factor in charisma (supposedly event quest exp multiplier) and intelligence and you’re well on your way. Heck, you don’t even need to hard grind because in the events you do you probably are looking for legendaries anyway lmao. 
---
Tl;dr: catch you at 100 in a month?
---
I spent what felt like 1/2 an hour (probably 10 minutes in actuality) scrapping over 7000 credits worth of ammo, and got about 2000 .50 cal back. The menu UI is absolutely horrible. For reference, I can craft over 12,000 .50 cal in about a minute, and that includes crafting gun powder at a chem station of the opposite side of my camp.
---
Levelled once and 3 Score.  Only did a couple of hours after the update.  All good though, like the teaming up thing.
---
My main account was banned from the whole Xbox live service so...
---
Bad I haven't gotten even 1 lvl up
---
Sorry this is off topic. Why the hell would they give us points for bullets, give us lead, gunpowder and copper. I know it's a game and games aren't realistic, but the more unrealistic they make it the harder it becomes to suspend your disbelieve. It's like they are trying to make it more like one of those FTP mobile games.
---
It seems like all the good looking skins are this way because they don't mesh with just how ugly and odd the models for many of the guns in this game are. I mean, the assault rifle alone must be almost impossible to make a basic skin for that actually looks good on it and works with the existing animations. 
---
For Bethesda, I mean. I'm sure a modder could do it tomorrow.
---
That option won't be available until mid July
---
From what I've noticed it starts at 1000 and always will be 25 XP more with each level
---
But we did not have to buy atoms before seasons.
---
I'm not sure how it worked in the past but currently changing the location of the camp unit does change the spawn location for visitors. I only sometimes spawn in at the same location as visitors though so it requires some testing to figure out what works.
---
I like testing different locations to avoid people arriving in an inconvenient location like standing in water, stuck under a foundation, etc.  
---
On the topic of trap camps, a recent person who would've enjoyed taking my junk failed at their mission because they had not fully tested the location where a player might spawn in. I arrived on a basement ladder which led to a bunch of boxes underneath the house and although it was walled-in, I immediately thought "Hm. This is a long way down and the boxes appear to be open at the top. That looks unusual and suspicious." =P
---
Oh i see, thanks! Many probably already reached 100 by then.
---
And I want a wall that is just an open frame so I can put the half walls on it for better roofs.
---
Also just more roof options.
---
I know, but I bought then when I wanted, now I refuse to buy :)
---
Are we sure there isn't a bonus modifer? Like if Zorbo gets ahead of you on the board you get a score bonus?
---
Nothing in Seasons was included in the PTS.
---
Not sure then. Probably was nerfed. Got the plans for them, but too expensive for me to crafta real good one.
---
I agree with you on that one, I have over 2,000 10mm, you think I really want to spend the time to sell all those to that machine? I think not. I may leave mine in my camp for couple of days and then scrap it because I don't have much camp budget left. For stuff like this they should have raised the camp budget.
---
Plenty of time to complete it. Just spend real money. Simple eh.
---
It honestly feels so fresh. Wastelanders added a lot of grind to the game, which isn't bad. 
---
This update brought in a new grind that kind of brought me back to some of the more fun areas of the game, as well things to do. 
---
Day 1 landed me at level 9 on seasons, and 4 character levels. A huge increase compared to my normal play sessions.
---
So we've got some machine that'll convert the 10 40mm quest reward grenades into 4 .38 bullets as inefficiently as possible? _Great, thanks. So useful. Such an incredible addition to the game. Good job Bethesda_.
---
U is has stronk? Stronk no do goo for brain jello, lake eye go wonky
---
I’m not too sure of anything. I’m primarily hoping Bethesda will respond and clear up any missing pieces we might not have, but these are the numbers we currently have to work with
---
I didn't say one way or the other. Just a tldr update
---
Yup same here, score stayed as 750/1025 at rank 2. So excited for the update and should not be surprised it’s bugged. OFFS Bethesda go back to school and learn how to release code that works.
---
Trust me, unless they're the 1% with a stick up their ass the rest of your team doesn't care.
---
It unequipped all my emotes. Just re-equip in atom shop.
---
I was in saloon having a drink one day in this settlement called Megaton and this weird fucking guy tried to pay me to blow up the town, said this guy "Tenpenny" would pay good money. Didn't even hesitate and blew his head clean off. Turns out he worked for this old prick named Allistair Tenpenny. Had this joint "Tenpenny Tower" decided to pay it a visit. What do ya know? Another prick.
---
There was a ghoul called himself Roy out at the main gate trying to get in, I gave him an alternative route to get in. Last I heard from my pal Three Dog is that he and his pals massacred the joint.
---
Well said Potato
---
I love NW (lvl 107) and logged for a second to finish this as well. What's nice about NW is there is no wrong way to play. I've rolled with heavy players and sent tons of lead down range and also hid in the dirty water outside of mama dulce's for a victory. It's great for afk play XP or for some intense moments.
---
I've even dressed up as santa for passive play. There were times a team adopted me as Santa and took me to victory!
---
F for your account. What happened?
---
I think the big problem is, they can't focus all their attention on 76 because they're trying to get starfield out the door.
---
They have to prioritize either 76 (which is still openly mocked but still considered an ok game with major problems that it has) or starfield which will most likely end up being a huge financial success as their games have been in the past. 
---
It's hard to look at something that is technically failing and gets shit on in every way and say "We should fix that." Instead of looking at starfield and going "We should get that out the door and cover up 76 as much as possible.". 
---
Even then, it's not about covering up past mistakes so much as it is that its their next big title that they're obviously gonna want to prioritize. My personal opinion is that the Austin studio is trash and never should have been handed this game. They don't know the engine and the last game they tried to release was an absolute commercial failure. They are doing what they can, but it's not enough. They miss the most obvious things and don't seem to ACTUALLY care. Just my opinion though.
---
It was in the files but it wasn't activated and tested. Like we knew what the item looked like and the ammo conversion rates weeks ago thanks to the PTS Dataminers but nobody could get access to it.
---
That'll teach Bethesda
---
Good for people that dont play NW, and the people who cant play the NW game mode even if they want to because Bethesda is fucked up and it works only in a few languages.
---
They should make it it into a mini-game or little side quest or something. Most likely is just visual though.
---
If you click back after each sell or buy transaction, it returns to the last menu item selected, making it easier to repeat multiple times. Then you only have to press back a couple of times to exit.
---
I was banned for "cheating" but a joke is a perm ban I guess
---
I like seeing people liking seeing it
---
I also love it. Im eager to do some math now to figure out my trajectory but I am really enjoying it.
---
Agreed, would be so much easier. Tried it last night and was a ball ache keep pressing the button all the time.
---
And the sinks stack :D
---
My concern it has been always there, long before public teams, I thought they were going to do something about with this release. 
---
But returning to the topic, ppl is just lazy. It is easier to leech an event on the last second here and there, than to go farm alone. Depends on the mood I suppose.
---
I cannot say it is better to get more exp completing events overall, because it is not. But without seeing the comparison between the completion of an event with +4 int and the bonus on events with the same base int, I do not know what I personally prefer, going back to the things about solo farming I exposed above.
---
If the difference it is not big, well, then ofc we should be creating building teams. But I can feel those ppl without even unyielding armor that cannot get real advantage of the +4. And their only resource is participating with other ppl on events and pseudoafk till the next event pops up.
---
My guess was more something along the lines of the guidestones or the interloper battle. It would kind of make sense if you looked at the name of each chapter.
---
Nice! So long as we do the dailies, the weeklies will just work themselves out.
---
Starting to sound like a big oversight from Bethesda then. That's unfortunate. Could also be this tedious on purpose then by the sound of it.
---
alright
---
Sorry to here. Now's the time to climb back up. A lot of good chances for heavy xp gains.
---
Oh yeah, that's pretty silly aswell.
---
Ladydevvan says she runs deep pocket on her armor
---
Well... Did you cheat? Some guy I know were perm banned for insulting people, I've read some of these messages and there was some racist stuff in there so I distanced from them.
---
Ah ok ty!
---
I did Project Paradise last night and the frame rate was in the single digits whenever an enemy was on screen.
---
Same here, I created one and only one person joined and left immediately after joining.
---
They have a great system already for vending and script machines. It only makes sense that they use the same format for the ammo converter.
---
It's possible that the gap will rise once a higher level, I'm only level 4 on the pass.
---
At this point are the FO1st subscribers not the investors though? 🤔
---
If the real A team helped, the game would've ascended beyond reality by now.
---
Well, that makes the issue I had today even more annoying. I just completed two weeklies (kill assorted robots and "gather building supplies) and got ZERO reward.
---
Eh I lost alot of progress i haven't played the game in about 2 weeks
---
RIP the ghillie suit, rip the Vang Sent SS armor i had rip my VE laser, rip my awesome underground bar
---
Well without the bloodied weapon you are going to suffer big time regardless of what you do.
---
uuuh, my psn is Beetlebugs
---
all i feel is pain after reading this
---
You got the reward at 3/5 for some reason.
---
I've got my eye on you
---
Nope no cheating all I did was say " Totally LegIt woking Gliyhc dupe on YT!!!! ???? 100%, works" and bop next day bye bye acocunt so now I've been playing sea of thieves and rdr2 on a new account and
---
I forgot to add, but also how do you keep from dying so easily? I will still get two tapped by ghouls and scorched, as well as shouted to death by a SB.
---
While at the same time, coincidentally im sure, nerfing how many atoms you can earn!
---
I said this, I said this when it was announced, it was nothing but an anti consumer move.
---
This game's practices and its state in general are nothing more then toxic.
---
To me it seems to double the amount less often.
---
Honestly, I dig this seasons thing for now because it has revived events (give us score for completing them please) and the dailies. Now do one focused on the scouts and fix how tedious and overly specific the badge challenges are.
---
We will see where it ends up at the end of the season and if you can actually finish it to level 100. The only complaints I have are UI related (ammo converter and challenge menu) and the bugs with actually finishing the challenges. 
---
Not to mention, the cosmetics are kinda cool. I'm not always a fan of the really over the top stuff, so the cosmetics in this are interesting to me.
---
A bit confused, is this a handmade rifle skin or a skin for a completely new weapon?
---
There are repeatable events you didn’t add up
---
With fo1st, I'm honestly not concerned with getting to 100 on the season. You'll be able to use atoms to gain roughly 20 levels if needed from the monthly atoms, yeah? People have done the math saying you can't miss a day, I'm not worried one bit about it.
---
Same here. I’d probably only be able to realistically do a few daily challenges but that could be 30-40 atoms a day and I’d rarely spend them. It’s ridiculous Bethesda is selling every 100 Atoms at a rate of $1.
---
Hydrogen bomb 🤔
---
I just looked it up. PSN Beetlebugs does not exist.
---
Did you notice that if you try to use the terminal in PA that you can't see the screen, they've used the animation for a lower terminal on a desk. You crouch down staring at the pedestal and can't see what options you're choosing
---
😆
---
I haven't tried because I'm still at work but a workaround that somebody posted to make mass ammo conversion less tedious is withdraw all of the ammo you want to keep except the ammo you DO want to convert and when you go convert some ammo ONLY that ammo will be listed as an option to convert so you can spam the X/A/Enter button to quickly convert ammo instead of fiddling with the menu so much.
---
I dont mind it if you are getting a decent amount of score from public events to help those who cant play every day, definitely gonna do every event tonight when I get home tonight to see what you actually get from each one. If it works out like difficulty setting matches the reward I reckon the heart of the swamp is going to be real popular, one of the fastest public events to finish and gives 3 treasury notes do hopefully more score, well if it actually gives you score I dont know
---
Does the weapon really make that much of a difference? That’s insane. I can get my zealots exploding prime .50 cal up to around 220 dps, but against the queen it only does 40 to body and 65 to the head. I thought i was doing really good until everyone around me stopped shooting and i got to see just how little i was hurting it.
---
yeah trippin
---
They dont kill the queen so fast because of their  bloodied weapons, they use weapons with bugged effects, like 50% limb damage, 33% vats and so on.
---
But playing bloodied without a bloodied weapon wont work obviously. :) just get yourself a 1star bloodied weapon from a player vendor. A little server hopping and you should find one.
---
yeah just use all the atoms you gain and you need like 20.000 SCORE less. Then you can skip loke 20 daylies
---
This was announced ages ago. Why do you seem shocked?
---
Spolier. You wont
---
Hot burning trash.
---

---
I have absolutely no idea what you mean by lengthy grind. Even "hard to get" materials like lead or nuked flora take maybe an hour to get, max.
---
I had the issue that after buying 2000 pts with 5.56 ammo i had to press the "back" button for each time I selected to sell ammo.
---
Seems like a decent work around. I personally don't understand the fuss, certainly not for those with a scrap box. It'll just be faster to make ammo, rather than convert. It seems honestly like a QoL feature for those without unlimited scrap space. 100% planning on keeping most unused ammo at 0 caps in my vendor, maybe they'll actually move.
---
That is what they are banking on.
---
We were earning to many atoms and that is just unacceptable. Paying £11.99 a month for 1st is just not enough money for them.
---
I earned 1500 (15 x 100) from the 10,000 xp challenge, and a large chunk of that came from doing One Violent Night event, once. The key is to keep the wendigo alive and run out the clock. Ghouls keep coming as long as the wendigo lives.
---
It's in "junk" for me.
---
Make sure you got it set up so it won’t auto charge you for next month. I made that mistake...
---
I know right? Instead of being downvoted to hell for the few that did.....
---
I just did the math myself having learned it's 25 SCORE more per level. My math shows without doing anything BUT the challenges (not including leveling up score amount). It would take 10.5 weeks. That number drops considerably with simply playing and leveling. 
---
I'm not worried either as I too am 1st and if need be will use the atoms. Still will be fun to try without using them.
---
I mean, even if you are in the building team, you only get, what +4 INT with four bonds? I still feel like teams focusing on events would still be better served by the events group. To be fair you are kind of at stratospheric levels of INT, and only a fraction is from the team. So assuming you had only the +4 and no other major buffs you would only be getting +8% XP Flat from the team. That's by no means bad, but I feel like double xp from events would be better if you are doing events frequently (like my team does).
---
Perhaps there is a licensing issue - iirc Oblivion through 76 all use ScaleForm for the UI and AutoDesk has completely killed it off.
---
That's for the legendary perks which was meant to be released yesterday and got delayed.
---
This has happened to me before try the following: 
---
Get out of the PA
---
Fast Travel a few times somewhere (Like between your camp and Vault 76)
---
Switch servers
---
Close the game and re open the game
---
I only like the sink because now I have a 20ft tall tower made of sinks.
---
Devs don’t need ammo at this point (if they still play at all) so it’s not something they would use. It was just a suggestion over a year ago that they finally read. Obviously f’d it up thinking they were doing something the community wanted.
---
Sorry, I'm just really tired of people wanting these people work for free. I'm really tired of "I can't have everything unless I pay for it!" That sounds completely irrational when people have mortgages to pay.
---
I'm curious if we're getting typical apocalypse Nazi BoS or something more interesting.
---
I know, I should've wrote that on the post.
---
I unlocked yesterday 5 of them just did 3 encrypted events solo
---
Right there with you! I'll be hoarding some atoms off to the side just in case week 10 hits and I'm a few levels shy. That jetpack is going to look great on our backs!
---
Well I think a base handmade with a powerful automatic receiver (and I may be slightly off because it's been a while since I used one) does just over 100 base damage whereas my bloodied handmade does 285 base. So the weapons do matter a lot.
---
You use fire proof to combat the scorchbeast's sonic attacks. I did not see you list bloody mess as a perk you use so make sure you use that. Getting killed in a few punching attacks will always be a problem that's what serendipity is for.
---
2 of my weekly's didn't give me any SCORE credit, so a little annoyed currently. I'm 1 or 2 weeklys away from everything done (for the opening day), but with those 2 glitched, I'm still at only SCORE 7. Hoping there will be a hot fix that'll retroactively give me my missing SCORE exp.
---
This is so cool. It's surprising to what length devs at Bethesda will go for these little snippets of hidden lore.
---
Why did you not queue up solo?
---
I’ve noticed the ceiling appears to be lower, for sure.
---
If I had to guess and this is literally JUST SPECULATION, but I reckon it's possible they got a Weekly completed at the same time as Killing the SQB (Maybe level up 3 times perhaps) and didn't realise, I've heard the "SQB giving 1000 SCORE" story multiple times but it all seems to track back to the one source, which is no offence to that person, it's just I think they made a mistake.
---
I hope I'm wrong though coz it would help a ton to get 1000 SCORE for SQB, even if it's a DR and you get 1000 first time, 800 second time, 600 third time and o forth till you just get 100 each SQB it will still help a ton.
---
3 of my weekly challenges were completed and didn't offer me the points so I still don't have the trash converter, I mean, ammo converter.
---
All I want is to see the Service Rifle from NV return :(
---
About 30% of the people on this sub do. And if you played I’d kick your ass like the bully did your cunt.
---
So did I go through some sort of time warp last night trading my 6k + of useless ammo cos I’m pretty sure I wasn’t doing that for over 6 hours
---
I leveled up once a day before this update, least now I don’t have to carry around a bunch of different goofy ass outfits for the challenge now... I dislike the nuclear winter challenge even more, I hate that shite battle royal game mode.
---
(Still a bit upset we no longer get daily and weekly atoms though...)
---
Yeah, I can finally wash my hands holy sh*t
---
For me it's a way to convert the .38 Ammo that nobody buys and convert a of the Grenades and Explosive ammo that nobody uses but outside of that I will continue to sell and craft ammo as usual.
---
Hahaha you nailed it! Yeah and lode barring isn’t working for some reason. I second the points delay though. They eventually come but they lag for sure.
---
It’s awesome. I’m usually the random on the server sending team invites to everyone through the social menu. Makes it so much easier and faster now, plus the teams I’ve been in have filled straight away. 
---
Does anyone know if it’s more beneficial to have the building or event team for overall xp levelling up?
---
Well hopefully I get them after I wake up tomorrow because after I got the nice sink nothing counted anymore.
---
I’m not sure it’s broken, because my main has herbivore, gets no benefit from it. My melee character has carnivore and gets the “broken” benefit from it.
---
Yeah, you did, because it wasn't out last night.
---
How much score do I need to get rank 5 (aka the ammo converter)? 
---
Unless I'm missing something, I can't see it in game.
---
(I logged in last night but then something came up and I had to turn it off)
---
I never encountered that, I stopped playing I think April or before then. My biggest issue since launch is colorblind support. The Night Vision scope is red on green. I would love to customize it so it is white or another color to have better contrast and therefore more visible to me.
---
I really want the 9mm Pistol from FONV too...it’s so much better looking than the 10mm pistol.
---
Umm yes it was, I got to level 5 around 11 pm pal
---
Good idea, poor execution. Was really hoping to get rid of some nukes and missiles.
---
You probably will. Be ready for a new patch in the near future. It’s got some bugs which we’re all used to and I’ve become accustomed to them to be honest.
---
That looks nice. I may pinch that idea myself at some point
---
Wait, what timezone are you in? Where i am it was released about 12 hours ago and it's night here.
---
OP, I have a 3* legendary bloodied gauss rifle in my inventory I would love to just give to ya. My IGN is HotMessMandy, come visit sometime. I set up in the bog north of Watoga. 
---
The other commentors are right though. There are glitched weapons that basically melt thru anything in seconds regardless of perks or builds.
---
I have bloodied mess maxed out too, sorry i forgot to mention. I don’t have fireproof though. That’s a good one. I’ve been saving my level ups for a week just in case i had to move things around or max a new perk. So i will definitely pick that one up. Thanks for the tip :)
---
B is back, A is go.
---
Well I just did my kill robots weekly and it awarded me no score at all but says I completed it 😎😎
---
your stairs are connected to a foundation right now and it keeps saying it cannot me removed, right?
---
so build another foundation elsewhere and connect that foundation to the unremovable stairs with floors or whatever and then remove the stairs
---
Not sure, but it does count for herd mentally mutation.
---
I can picture the team announcing it weeks ago having a great laugh at the community rejoicing over its addition knowing that it would be hated immediately. The devs are trolls.
---
I enjoy just trying to stay in trees now, find a way to hop up, move from branch to branch without falling to your death or being spotted. Only weapon allowed is the bow and see how long you can last. If you run out of trees and the circle closes in you accept your fate
---
I have a B/25/25 lever for sale on pc for 20k if you need a sniper
---
What a time to be alive
---
Not everyone, just the absolute grinders. For the player who plays every day but not as hardcore as the top grinders, they'll finish this after a few weeks given the increase in EXP required per level. 
---
I wish they went the route of RDR2's Outlaw Pass. Static EXP per level and the abundance of EXP gained, but it was balanced enough that the deadline was doable even after starting late.
---
Well yeah, because this definitely has P2W written all over it if it’s not the way it is now. Ghillie marine armor? Practically invisible already, that’ll just compound the issue.
---
No they/we are the customers/consumers. The investors ploughed in the big bucks at the beginning for the Server hardware and game Development and expect a financial return, FO1st members expect a level of service from the game, Devs are having to walk the line between the two.
---
It's great. We had two public teams doing the mission through Big Bend Tunnel last night. Brilliant addition.
---
I never play NW either and only played for the daily. I didn’t think about going in the nuke zone and then stimming. I found a hazmat suit so was running around looking for someone to shoot me. Managed to make it to 4th but so glad I did as got the wreath and Christmas gifts as a reward. Might actually play again as it’s quite fun.
---
Something to listen to that sets the right tone while you struggle with the ammo converter.
---
I am not sure why you are so upset for potentially not being able to max out a time-gated reward when playing casually anyway. And then you don't want levels you don't need? What does that even mean? Casual players should expect casual rewards. If you want the best, you should be expected to no get it casually.
---
Well, Im doing my part.
---
Its garbage. It converts ammo but you have to go through a billion menus to do anything. Keep making a ruckus until the Austin studio changes it.
---
I wonder what new currency the Brotherhood will bring to the game?
---
It's such a stupid reward for the amount of effort. 100 SCORE for 10,000 EXP is an insult. Unless you absolutely play every day and grind for EXP for a lot of those days, you won't get to 100.
---
I’m on PS4 but i appreciate the offer though.
---
They did add a few kill 76 creatures challenges with the patch worth 40 atoms each. Doesn't make up for the loss of dailies or weeklies, but it's better than nothing.
---
Im pretty sure Bethesda doesnt test ANY of their weapon skins, and i will have a hard time being convinced otherwise, considering that at least 5 of the weapon skins ive bought have non-functioning ironsights, this one, the red rocket pump shotty, and a few others i cant remember off the top of my head. Its a consistant issue tho with SOOOO many of the cosmetics, where its very obvious they didnt test to see if it actually works, or conflicts with existing models heavily, as a few Atom shop items have for a while now.
---
Put the well on top of it. Maybe that would make it better. 😃
---
No you can't. I tried thinking the same.
---
The naivety in your response is astounding.
---
   
---
‘We’ll complain... It’ll get remedied’ - how often does that actually happen? There are bugs and issues which date back to initial release...
---
Also, a new item cannot be both ‘super cool’ and ‘not worth using’ - either it’s simply ‘cool’ aesthetically and somehow that’s supposed to be enough, or you stop hiding the fact that this is supposed to be a functional ammo converter which is not fit for purpose.
---
How are those effects bugged? A genuine question, i don’t really get how that works.
---
Your weeklies gave you score at 3/5 completed.
---
Yup. They found an even dumber way to set things up. Amazing to see.
---
As far as I understand the patch notes, you can convert a private team to a public one. Im not sure where the buttons are or how you do it but i imagine it would be apparent when active
---
yes but do you keep the suff in your scrapboxes as well?
---
Same bro. Bethesda has jokes it seems.
---
Not to mention the fact that if you charge up the Gauss Pistol in first person, the "hand shaking" animation causes the reticle to move WAY above the actual center of the screen, making it REALLY hard to aim a charged Gauss pistol shot, kinda defeating the purpose.
---
They simply deal insane and damage. Google “fallout 76 magic effects”
---
Like what was mentioned earlier, having fireproof perk will help against sb screech. Either that or dense mod added to chest armor.
---
Just add stuff. You could store the items that you already have down (from the list in the Daily challenges) and just place them right back where they were and it should count.
---
Well who knew there was a whole world with different time zones to the place you live. That’s a shocker
---
I have always been lenient towards the Austin studio because they're new and learning the engine or whatever nonsense I tell myself while sober. We need to keep making a ruckus until they fix it because that's the only way they seem to fix things.
---
The Ammo converter doesn't need to be even close to as complicated as it is. If they wanted to go the route they did that they should have made a new currency that can be used at the Ammo vending machines. Then they could have done the same with medicine etc. Fix a big problem while giving people what they want.
---
Did you notice if the public events were giving Score?
---
Despite it likely being an error that they're available, I can't imagine it looking good for their image to take away an unintended (and harmless) benefit as fast as possible when the general reaction to Update 20 has been rather negative. If I were in their shoes, I'd just own up to the error, and say "the items are available to be earned for the next 7 days".
---
What'll likely happen, though, is the bug will catch their attention after a day or two, and they'll release a hotfix to address an unintended bug in Nuclear Winter, which will fix the item availability.
---
Having building improves XP overall. Think about it. (pun)
---
Now seriously...with my 5 piece unyielding, under armour a team of four and food/drink  bonus. It's is like Triple XP weekends. And don't need to do events together.
---
Yeah it is, it’s only practical use right now is to get rid of missles and grenade rounds for something. 
---
Other than that it’s not worth the time flaffing through laborious menus
---
So I’m using the dense mod, it’d be better to not be in power armor during the fight?
---
Everyone keeps saying that, but how else is the OP at SCORE 10 (if truthful), when I'm behind him only by 1 or 2 weeklys, so 1-2k exp. I don't think 2k exp is 3 score levels worth, right?
---
More pistols would def be welcome, I gotta give cred to 76 because of the great variety of weapons like in NV, something 4 lacked in my opinion, but something about the Service Rifle just tickles my pickle
---
The rewards are pretty casual, mostly cosmetics that would be nice to have, gated behind a pretty severe grind. Being a casual player shouldn't gate you from the better/later rewards of an entire new system replacing daily and weekly Atom rewards. And what I mean by "don't need levels" is that I'm happy with my various characters builds and the Legendary Perks are terrible (I tested them in the PTS), so grinding xp just for Seasons is incredibly dull. 
---
"the best"? Seriously? Some cosmetics? I never expected to get the Vault Raider Gear and I don't expect to ever hit max Rep with the factions, but this isn't (or shouldn't be) anything like those things. They are/were long term goals and not time-limited content.
---
Really though, read the room. Even outside my personal grips, very few people are welcoming this news.
---
Time to get making some cranberry relish then lol. Which type of underarmor do you use?
---
Dense mod on armor doesn't apply when in power armor. If you use PA, then fireproof perk works better.
---
Np happy hunting! B fixers have been getting duped a lot so hopfully theyll become more accessible
---
What are you missing?  We'll still hook you up.
---
or how many resurface
---
Agree
---
You would think.
---
You ever acquire the Survivalist’s Rifle in NV? One of my favorite guns in all the games.
---
Is there a reason you're being such a cunt over nothing or what?
---
Endless tab key spamming
---
Don't forget the stingy conversion rate. 2000 points converts to about maybe 400 5.56 that i can craft faster even with having to swap perks before hand
---
You ever require the Survivalists Rifle in NV? One of my favorite weapons in all the games.
---
I hear ya. No worries. Everyone gets a trophy or I will literally cry. EVERYONE! lol
---
Vault 76 shielding...if I recall. 2 intelligence.
---
You can buy two whole battle passes with that many atoms at 200 levels you can purchase with 30k atoms or $120 for 100 SCORE levels... at 150 atoms a Level so you heard it here first $[
---
You were boosted by the weekly challenge rewards. It won't go as fast for the rest.
---
\&gt;  Don't forget the developers have to make a living making this game. 
---
I am sorry but this is such a foolish response. 
---
If they were gonna rely so much on this monetization scheme they should've made FO76 free to play. The grind is absurd for a player who paid for a 30-60 dollar game, it's like Warframe except it's bad because of the entry price. 
---
Since they sold this as a AAA game and this Season concept is timed (for only 10 weeks!) they should absolutely make it unlockable for the standard player. Not someone who either buys the whole journey to max rank or plays the game religiously 10 hours a day, 7 days a week until the Season ends.
---
I couldn't even interact with him earlier, ended up crouching and crept up on him then stood up.
---
I could get the daily from him after that so maybe I startled him.
---
Well it depends what kind of build you are..commando, heavy, melee? You’re gonna need a bloodied weapon that fits your category. I’m pretty sure you can find a cheap bloodied. It’s not gonna have god roles and it may be a one star, but you shouldn’t have trouble finding one.
---
I just want to be able to add ammo to it like a stash or a vendor and have it grind that ammo into points over time while I'm off doing something
---
Okay, that’s what i was curious about. Which one would be better, honestly? Or at least in your opinion.
---
Scope too small, the entire game is horribly out of balance.
---
Now look at the Carnivore/Herbivore + Strange In Numbers ramping AID numbers sky high.
---
I get +60 AP from Angler Steak now.
---
I like it, but it does seem like one still needs to tag everything for exp? Any experience on this? I tried to look, if it had changed when I was in a public team in white spring. Someone was killing the mobs and got 0 exp for being in the same building.
---
Definitely a classic I used as my standard weapon often, I also had plenty of fun with the Mercy grenade launcher
---
You do realise some players don't actively try to gain levels past the point of getting their builds and bonus (Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper for example) perks and getting their godrolls? Some days I kill a few lowbie Scorched in the Forest because that's where I'm hanging out and taking screenshots. Others I spend time doing the easier events with friends, barely landing any hits on additional enemies because they melt instantly.
---
It's not quite so 'in context' to act like it is constantly raining xp in everyones day-to-day play.
---
Does it give purified water at all? Guessing it would be too easy to farm purified and sell at npc vendors huh?
---
AFAIK the reason was they gave a fresh team with mostly mobile experience (Bethesda Studios Austin) the task to put multiplayer into their engine from literally 1997 AND come up with a fun and financially stable service game.
---
Just a working service game is almost a miracle when you look at the market.
---
Even if I assume a budget of TES6, which clearly wasn't the case, that whole idea is completely bonkers and I find it more plausible that this is just a test balloon for testing the waters (and customers) for a future Elder Scrolls 76.
---
Thanks for the heads up on this. I id 2 x matches today and ended up with the xmas wreath, presents and the ratty little xmas tree Ive been wanting ever since I saw it in a players camp. Plus some skins I think but I have no idea what. Gonna jump in later and do a few more.
---
psn: Owl_No
---
The Ammo converter is a honey pot to lure casual players away from SCORE challenges and into converting neglible amounts of ammo for 10-30 minutes at a time.
---
These players who can't complete every challenge every day will still want the Black Cosmos PA, and will PayPig hard to get it.
---
Agree with previous poster about the handmade suggestion - you should be able to buy a one star handmade, max level, for 10-15k easily.
---
Concentrate on grinding some caps for that and you’ll notice a big diff. You won’t be taking out the SBQ in two mins with it, but it’ll be significant better than your 50cal.
---
If you were playing once a week you were still missing 6 days of daily challenges anyway. You were missing atoms then, you are missing score now. Personally I prefer to have a more structured goal and more "exclusive" rewards for my grind than everyone being able to have everything. Some rewards deserve to be more exclusive and based on your skill and dedication to the game. Perhaps you feel that the rewards are casual (mostly they are) but I still think that it is good to be able to show off an exclusive reward based on actually playing the game and not mindlessly grinding to appease RNG gods. I will take this over gifts and pails any day of the week.
---
Right now since you're just starting a bloodied build, it'd be better to run PA with fireproof until you get better weps and if you decided which bloody build to go. You got bloodied heavy, bloody rifleman, bloody commando( both of which can go stealthed for better damage output) or bloodied melee. It sounds confusing and like alot of work but just hang in there, ask questions when you got em and you'll get there.
---
It seems to be really good at pissing people off.
---
Guess I’m not getting the fireplace door then :(
---
Why does everything they implement have to have such strict limitations? Is it really that bad to let you exchange any amount of ammo you want in one go? Nope, 2000 ammo points is the limit. Deal with it nerd.
---
Welcome to Pennsylvania!
---
Press and hold back button
---
New Vegas had the the best weapons for sure. So much variety, especially with the Gun Runner’s Arsenal.
---
I’ve been doing a heavy build since about level 30, but I’m pretty much able to swap around when i need to between heavy, rifleman, shotgunner, and commando. Only thing i don’t have ready to swap to is basically anything melee. 
---
Honestly it’s been just a nightmare for me to find one. I keep getting absolutely crappy weapons from purveyor like trouble shooters pipe pistol and other bs. I’ve tried making a plasma caster about 6 times now and wouldn’t get anything good out of it, which isn’t a total loss i guess since i have the grounded mutation. Idk man, I’m just soul searching for the right one, i guess. Lol
---
Weird, I bought the most expensive plan, shielded, for 200g, then learned it.  It seemed to apply itself to the underarmor I had in inventory but it applied the treated version.  I couldn't apply a different lining at the workbench after.
---
Umm, you’re the one who told me I couldn’t have done something last night that I definitely did. How does that make me the cunt? Is someone feeling tired, do you need a feed or hasn’t you had your nappy changed for bed yet?
---
That is what I do. Spam three buttons. Reminds me of Fallout 4 before I discovered console commands on PC. Spam for XP.
---
I guess it's not so bad if you run a macro for 30 minutes
---
At least the ammo converter is easy to get. Imagine it was the Level 100 reward, and you grind away to get it, only to find this. I would totally loose it.
---
Weapons are cheap to repair, so while you *may* want 5 INT to be able to equip those perks, you'd probably be better off ignoring them and just using the **Improved Repair Kits** you get from SBQ and Encryptid. And either pay people to mod the weapon for you, buy the Mods rather than crafting them, or craft it on an alt until you get to the Gold Bullion weapons, and then it'll be worth dumping a few banked levels to move points around temporarily.
---
Personally, I would also get rid of Class Freak. Plenty of more beneficial perks - especially in Luck, and *especially* for a hybrid build. I honestly doubt the gun accuracy penalty from Twisted Muscles would be noticed.
---
I'd replace Rad Resistant without a doubt. Just make/use Rad Shield! Twice as strong as RadX, and it doesn't suppress mutations.
---
Is nobody gonna talk about how vats is still a broken mess?
---
Not only do crit shots still miss (at least 75% of the time) but damage numbers will show without the enemy taking any actual damage. I've had this happen with several different enemy types and both in and out of vats.
---
Just yesterday I registered about 10k damage over several shots in vats... on a bloatfly... yet it still had a full healthbar. Suddenly after a dozen or so shots it finally died when I switched weapons and shot it once for 800ish damage.
---
This happens ALL the time. I've wasted hundreds of rounds of ammo because of this glitch/bug.
---
That's an amazing idea, but I doubt Bethesda would deliver.
---
What part if any of my post told you it was 6 hours to trade your ammo?
---
What part of an update not being brought at the same time worldwide like they said it would, is my fault?
---
What part of you being a cunt and then behaving more like a cunt isn't making you aware of your cunty behaviour?
---
Season pass/legendary run whatever you want to call it should not ever be end game content. It should be additional content that gives you more incentive to play. 
---
When your core mechanic on the legendary run is fundamentally seeming to be stacked against you then players have a reasonable right to be discouraged by it and outraged even if the content is free.
---
Personally I think it was dumb to give free atoms in the first place and I never saw a reason to buy atoms anyways. But when you take that away same thing, of course people are gonna be outraged. 
---
This was a hard-core cash grab but hey games gotta make money. The main complaint is if theyre gonna cash grab at least give decent ammo converters and make the quests track and work correctly.
---
Pardon?
---
Can't wait to find some outfit using the Indian language name
---
Caps aren’t really an issue for me, i do a ton of vendor trading and price just fairly enough to keep people coming back, as well as making power armor sets for lower levels for a few thousand. It’s like i have a job in this damn game but i still love it, lol. 
---
That’s crazy though, i never would have even imagined a handmade would do more than a .50. Than you for the advice, my friend. Now i can’t wait to hop on in a few hours.
---
Call the support, maybe they help you get your account back.
---
Ngl, but the atom rewards for completing most of the in game challenges aren't worth the effort. 20 Atoms for sinking 7600 hours into the game is a fucking joke on Bethesda's part. Whereas collecting all copies of say 'The Unstoppables' gives you 80 Atoms, it's a bit of a pisstake.
---
Sure, some people may end up completing the legendary run very quickly, but it's not nice to refer to these people as 'No life 1% players'. I share their complaints that the game has a serious lack of content. Once you've completed all of the story quests, side quests, that's it. Theres literally nothing to do after that except grind out public events and daily events.
---
Chill out and just enjoy the new content for as long as you can until it's completed, and if you're bored of reading all the complaining posts, don't go on reddit.
---
Kek yeah that's the only real issue with it
---
it is as if the devs dont fucking know their own game 
---
fucking ridiculous how they developed this shitty ammo converter which encourages you even more to use .38 ammo rather than using that piece of shit device
---
All the scrap, Caps, Scrip, GB and fireworks rewards are insulting
---
With less free atoms they thankfully removed that annoying hassle called choice. So now we get... a wood armor ghillie suit. Sweet...
---
Guy got early access lmao
---
Heyyy, was that you in my NW match just a bit ago? A lvl 1 on Xbox? Lmao. 
---
I enjoy NW and honestly, I’m not annoyed seeing that. I just thought “You idiot” and went about my bush wookie-ing.
---
www.falloutfirst.com explains it all
---
I honestly cant play it without Gun Runners Arsenal, it adds so much, honestly New Vegas had the best DLC of all Fallout games imo
---
God I wish this was Prey Online
---
it aint rare, i sell it for 7caps
---
which means u stupid
---
The season pass thing is going to be a long grind, even if you do every daily, and every weekly challenge, without missing a single one, you still won’t have earned enough score to get all the season rewards, making it a requirement for players to spend atoms to get the rewards
---
Yeah it's bad, needs a "convert all" button, rather dump all the ammo I had saved taking up space in my stash. Because it will take a few hours to convert and the gain will be pretty low. Will rather spend the time farming flux.
---
Now i know exactly what I’m doing when i get home. Thanks man, i appreciate the help. :)
---
I stopped supporting it when fallout 1st came out
---
No. The loot pool is already too bloated. I get that some players would be content with a shitty prefix or even a non-legendary because it’s a new gun, but I would much rather put a skin on my handmade and call it a day.
---
Did you miss the OP? Even if we did dedicate an hour a day, just this Season for the later items, it's not enough. There doesn't seem to be enough SCORE points without either changing to a heavy xp grind playstyle for the repeatable or spending Atoms. If it turns out to be possible by doing 'only' two thirds of the total sum of dailies, because there is a cap on how high each rank costs, then I'll be the first to voice my appreciation. But I don't see it, because they want people to buy Atoms and skip. 
---
Also, you are trading mindlessly grinding the RNG to just mindlessly grinding. That's like saying getting punched in the face and getting a black eye is a vastly superior experience to getting whacked around the head with a baseball bat. Neither is desirable.
---
Seems to be more efficient at stressing everyone out than actually converting ammo
---
3000+ hours into this game and I'm done. Just nah. Bethesda just have no idea what they're doing. 
---
To get score you do nothing different we've already been doing for 18 months. It is not content. It's just more and more useless skins.
---
And a bottle of Nuka Dark Rum.
---
Not sure if the PTS is still 'Private' or has gone public but I'm pretty sure that the majority of people who have access to it are content creators and YouTubers and they seem to be okay with whatever shit is given to them on the PTS. Plus Bethesda rarely listen to what they say as well.
---
Would be nice if it worked like a Vendor, where you can sell the ammo for points, and buy what you want with it, or at least set it to make that ammo type over time.
---
But I guess that would require another currency to be implemented, and also make some way to only sell ammo in batches. Guess that's to hard to do...
---
Not gonna lie, apparently Pennsylvania sucks.
---
If you go to place your CAMP is it green (placeable) or red (not placeable)? Could be cool to have some new camp locations 😂
---
Aye me too last night, though it usually completes for me. Did Radiation rumble with no issues as well. THAT was a nice change.
---
So why you gotta call me stupid for a simple question?
---
Nah, there's a trick where you place the item on top of whatever you want to clip it into, then move the item it's on top of to terrain where it clips in but will let you place it. Upon placing, it jumps up to the proper height but the item on top stays at the level it was. It's tricky to make small adjustments since you have to start over from scratch if you go too far (I had to do it about 15 times to get the sink in as far as possible without the top of the table clipping through the bottom of it) but it's pretty much the most valuable CAMP trick imo.
---
How do you skip levels with atoms? I didn’t even see that option. I know it’s supposed to be there. Did they make it so you can only skip later levels?
---
Np. This is a great sub for questions and there's alot of people willing to give advice. Like I said, you'll get there.
---
But they made it have a computer terminal and singular ammo box trading, meaning your thousands of ammo will take an hour to trade in.
---
1k takes an hour you said, therefore with some fairly basic sums that I’m sure mummy will teach you in time 6k + would take 6 + hours.
---
No, it's that every QOL feature they put in creates need for another QOL feature.
---
Disrespectful is the right word.
---
It's hot garbage and you can't change my mind otherwise.
---
The UI is trash, the Ratios are trash, the entire process to use the item itself is trash.
---
Who thought such small input and ONLY SMALL INPUTS was a good idea?
---
What kind of ass backward thinking went I to the implementation of this?
---
Did you target the fissure site prime?
---
I’m not really complaining, it’s what I wanted
---
Our roads look an awful lot like the Fo76 Flatwood roads.  Broken down cars on the side, dead one-headed ragstags....
---
"Thousands of ammo will take an hour" i think you misread that one.
---
It was brought out at the same time worldwide.
---
The more item lines in your inventory (notes keys etc), the longer it takes for you to perform any action.
---
It also lags out other players too
---
Points have no weight...you can trade in at a later date.
---
I can see that, it seems like a pretty generous community. It saddens me a little that someone’s been downvoting me for asking for help. But oh well, it’s worth it for all the advice I’ve received.
---
Despite my attempts at checking for updates, mine wasn't available until about 12 hours ago, that ain't on me.
---
But just doing a few West-Tek runs (with server hopping) is still giving faster and more XP. I only played 3 hours yesterday, but it got me to SCORE rank 12.
---
I just did my daily quests, the daily/weekly challenges and then did West-Tek until my food buffs ran out.
---
I’ll just continue to give my ammo away. I’ve never had trouble getting what I need through the tinker bench. I believe being able to scrap for resources would have been the best approach and not break the economy of the game.
---
From what I have read, for the first 2 weeks, you can only gain SCORE by playing in game. After that, you can buy progress on your seasons board. I believe it's 150 atoms per level. We should see that as an available option in a couple weeks!
---
Ssshhhhhhhhhh
---
Ah im with you now
---
Fridge would have been fine if the base version was free and all the reskins were atom shop. But damn
---
What are you even on?
---
I just offered the quickest solution.
---
I also despise having to lvl up because it takes forever when you're really high level and you are forced to wear unyielding. Not as easy and natural as when you're lvl 100.
---
Can't remember how long this has been a thing. Did it come in with Wastelanders? So disappointed Patch 20 didn't fix this.
---
Take my angry upvote. I'm still salty over the one time I used it. Once was enough for me, I'd rather try ringing my ISP than do that shit again.
---
The pip-boy interface is hot garbage for an online game as well. What were you expecting?
---
I did, I guess I forgot to mention that the quest did start. I've done it many times and knows it basically tells everyone on the server which is why I was so confused.
---
👍🏻
---
Lower your expectations
---
I leveled up three times as well, only got to rank 8 I think? My last reward for ranking up was the pip-boy paint.
---
Honestly, I like this grind a bit. Though with the math I may not get to 100 since I’m not FO1st, but no biggie since all I want is to hit 94 for that Gatling Gun skin.
---
We're getting downvoted by someone who wants this to stay hidden apaprently. Can't deny i'd like it as well...
---
Or instead of only buying everything with free atoms you throw five bucks at the game for once. The entire point of the atom shop was supposed to be people paying cash for cosmetics in exchange for getting free story content, not people never spending a dime because it's so easy to earn free atoms.
---
Dont expect a fallout game and just enjoy the game, i love it
---
I always drop mine in front of the grave when I'm done, just in case someone needs it.
---
Still waiting on a -90% weight one I can lug around all the time.
---
How many u got?
---
Hard SAME
---
Hahaha yeah no. Vats is still broken in so many ways...
---
I've had that happen with me before. You spend ages going through a silo, launch a nuke at the site and then nobody bothers to show up.
---
Bethesda updated the "furious" effect incorrectly and it now applies on many weapons with a high fire rate, except it's an unlimited damage stack. Follow the youtuber angry turtle for more info. He calls them "magic weapons".
---
It gives dirty water, unfortunately.
---
Rewards are for doing "something". If you do not enjoy the something (playing the game to me/mindlessly grinding to you) then nothing is desirable. It is normal for any game dev to try to create incentives for engaging players frequently and regularly. Anyway, public events award score points, so it is not even just the daily/weekly challenges to do for progress.
---
It was my favorite Fallout game by far. Wish they’d do a remaster with the current engine.
---
I had a good laugh at all the replies. But yeah the user interface is really, really unfriendly. 
---
The exchange rate would not be such a problem if a "convert all [enter name of ammo]" option was available. So basically, if they fix the interface, it will be ok.
---
Sounds like the part of the community that has access to PTS shat the bed if the ammo conversion station was available to them. Or, Bethesda was so set on it the way it was, that they didn't have time to change it (or whatever excuse you want to use). 
---
From another comment, they said even PTS players didn't have access to it. Kind of a shame, really. It seems like it would help a lot of low/mid level players out. Specially those without fallout 1st.
---
It just works. Almost... after a year and a half...
---
The settee
---
It's the most atrociously stupid interface i've seen in a while.
---
Hi again. I see there is a pop-up from the new SCORE thing that obstructs my view. I think I have nailed that but will keep testing tomorrow. I'll update a new one if all good.
---
80% of the time it works 50% of the time
---
0.15% drop chance from events in the Savage Divide, and currently the only way to get those Scout Masks, so congratulations!
---
Unfortunately, when I tried it told me I wasn't allowed to place my CAMP outside the legal area, and no amount of jostling it got it to set down.  
---
Kind of a shame, that would have been pretty awesome.
---
Bethesda: Have I got a solution for you! Pay 150 atoms per level!!!
---
You don't share XP, still need to tag. My guess is only private teams.
---
[Related](https://i.redd.it/0zsnjsphxob21.jpg)
---
I'll have the team take a look! Certainly not ideal...
---
This is only partially true. I had two different score challenges auto complete today (post-patch). Granted, they still provided the reward but I wasn't even halfway done with them when they "completed"
---
I’m stealth commando but as soon as the SBQ is nuked I switch out what strength cards I can spare for Heavy Gunner, break out my bloodied Gauss Mini Gun &amp; hop into my emergency protocol/carry weight excavator PA. 
---
Just because your build is set one way, it doesn’t kill the option to quickly switch to heavy gunner power armor if you choose.
---
Failing that, as other have pointed out, keeping the mobs off the heavy gunners is not slacking, it’s a massive help to the whole server 👍
---
There is a combination of perks that auto heals you at low health, basically refreshing your health by 45 points when you get low. Use the perk life giver max rank, and adrenal reaction, and speed demon. You can find this on the angry turtle YouTube channel
---
yes, you can use points from dupes to unlock cards you don't get.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Be civil and trade ammo to eachother and stop doing the seasons as a collective until Bethesda gets scared.
---
I don’t mind spending money for ranks, but the current cost of 150 atoms per rank is too much. Especially after nerfing atoms you can earn.
---
I’ll check him out. Thanks man
---
Also a solo player turned huge fan of the public teams, because I love doing events and it’s awesome to have folks to do them with. I’m just hoping this enthusiasm lasts, and it’s not just because today was the first day!
---
Well the no weight part is nice.
---
Yeah I’m not receiving any score for the weekly challenges...??? Somethings not right!
---
Stick to the forest for awhile. Don't rush the quest lines. Do events to level up. Don't get to attached to a weapon, if it breaks kill something and take theirs.
---
Google nukes and dragons and somewhat pick a build early on, it'll save you time later
---
. 
---
Make sure to sleep do the well rested xp boost
---
Shovel
---
Locations on the map. Memorized! I just fast travel if it isn’t there. No biggie. And come back
---
You actually can tag them, then they'll be shown when you open the map.
---
Make sure you have adrenal reaction running too and that you’re commando (not rifleman) so that your crits proc quicker 👍
---
Haha just like the other things they've changed
---
I think the main issue is, the main ammo I'm trying to break down? noone wants.  
---
I had tens of thousands of rounds of .38, .44, 10mm and fusion cells in my vendor at 0 caps since like may. Never went anywhere because noone uses those guns past like level ten.  
---
People want/need .45, .308, 5mm, 50cal
---
How do you get/use the converter?
---
If only it was 2012 and this meme was still even remotely funny
---
&gt; Anyway, public events award score points, so it is not even just the daily/weekly challenges to do for progress.
---
I did plenty earlier and didn't get a single point. Are you sure you aren't mistaking completing Daily/Weekly challenges whilst doing the events with the reward? Because if you are right then that's awesome, but also bugged.
---
I've spent 10minutes selling unwanted ammo to be able to buy 200 or so .45 rounds... I scrapped the ammo converter after that. What a letdown 😕
---
Me and my buddy were able to use the public teams on the private server to get the rewards.
---
That is what the shitty return rate is for.
---
I didn’t know that perk sharing was a thing because I’ve always played solo. I noticed my teammates had perks next to their name and thought “huh that’s weird, wonder what that’s for,” so this is good to know.
---
You can create a "1 person team" on a private server too. Still get the team reward (25% more xp) and everything
---
I’ve never gotten to the point of grinding daily atoms before anyway, so this setup is better for me! I’d like to draw attention to the fact that I could’ve sworn I read in the patch notes Ward is standing still now.. logged in just now and he’s fucking walking around like nothings happened... he really deserves his Meme like status. I just think Bethesda are so funny it’s like they’re all guys with great ideas but just get baked at the office all day.
---
Nobody likes spamming the activate button. That's our whole beef. It's not fun, it can't even be considered "playing".
---
And how about the random cap drops when your teammate completes a quest? It’s very nice.
---
I had to make room in my camp for this bulky thing. Then I actually tried using it... yikes. It's a bulky and ugly, inefficient, convoluted time consuming piece of crap and I'm probably gonna scrap it.
---
Imagine.. never again joining a world where your camp couldn't be placed 🤯
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Ah Ok. Im familiar with that trick too. Saw a clip on you tube recently.  Thanks for the info!
---
It's not just while sneaking, unfortunately. Vats crits consistently miss more than they hit... even though theoretically they should never miss. Regular vats shots will also register damage numbers without the enemy taking actual damage.
---
Vats is still a hot mess 😔
---
Watched the ~12 min interview that was recorded weeks ago.  Pretty disappointing.  Falsely advertised as a DLC Roadmap ... they showed a screenshot of the roadmap but didn't actually talk about it.
---
U dun have to pay this much just COMPLETE ur daily n weekly challenge pal
---
I can trade ammo I don't need for ammo I don't need.
---
The Captain Cosmos stuff is literally just copy-paste assets from a FO4 quest that was part of the DLC store. It WAS a 3-4 hour long quest in that game.
---
The only useful thing u can buy for atoms is a protectron collector. I have no idea how it is ever possible to sell them for this amount of money. It is worse than some players who sell free2take crap like they spend 10 hours to get it.
---
\&gt; But you don’t have to actually do anything your teams doing. 
---
And that, my friend, is the whole point, at least for me. They are a low-pressure entry to social gaming - kinda the "casual acquaintance" to the traditional team's "best buddies". And being a rather introverted person with some low-grade social anxieties, I am profoundly grateful and happy they exist.
---
I'll release a mod tomorrow removing the terminal from the mesh, bricking the function.
---
It's better off as a cute activate object with no purpose.
---
Yeah I would love too but it’s just not Fun at all I’ve done every daily at least 100+ times and it’s just not something anyone enjoys anymore
---
Nothing. Just drop it.
---
You can't trade any gold bullion stuff.
---
The game failed at launch, theyve been deaperatwly trying to monetize the shit out of it and exploit their still somehow loyal player base to milk their wallets and meet financial expectations. It's baffling how many people defend them and actually enjoy being milked. The amount of content this game has received since launch is nothing short of a joke.
---
That is exactly why my motivation for this game is gone. Too much grinding, too many problems, too many bugs, too much P2W. I am sadly done with this game. I was thinking about doing a new character and doing this season to level 100 but after reading some information about it, I lost my will... I rather play something else.
---
Exactly my point kudos
---
I last minute jumped into 2 events where i basically just collected the reward, and got score points. Could be bugs. We will know more the coming days.   
---
My point remains that if you do not like playing, you will not enjoy any reward system.
---
I played through fallout 4 and just remembered that 😂
---
Thanks. Good to know.
---
Will do brother, thanks. :)
---
They have changed most of them i think they are more enjoyable
---
You don't have to buy them now. It's  a very optional thing.
---
But when you’ve came back to play wastelanders grinding some extra levels and stuff after that finished it was just too repetitive I took a long break and now I’m ready for another probably won’t come back
---
If possible, find someone to play with or give you a bit of a hand early in. Some of the systems can be a bit unintuitive to start off.  
---
Once you get going though, it's fun, if a little slow/grindy around level 20-30
---
They're literally just recycling and reselling DLC they didn't even make. It was something made by a fan n sold through their store.
---
Tbh I'm just going to aim for rank 39
---
Probably the best advice anyone could give is to get on YouTube and search for a streamer called ‘Angry Turtle’ - he does FO76 videos where he tests different builds and kit.
---
If you search through his output he’ll definitely have a guide to a bloodied build and he’ll talk about the perk cards, mutations etc, all covered in about 20mins 👍
---
He’s a genuinely great resource for stuff like that
---
they will, for $20 USD, and it won't work.
---
Is there a limited reserve of gold (as in real life) ?
---
This game smells like big foot's taint.
---
Who are you to dictate anything?
---
Newly converted solo guy, was expecting a very buggy system with ridiculous team challenges but so far so good. Really easy to group up and events like you said are definitely more lively. Couldn't complain with just complete 3 events with a group. Hopefully they stay reasonable like that
---
Buy it back? Lol
---
is this not enough for you?
---
https://i.imgur.com/rttVLL3.jpg
---
I think they outsourced the job to someone that was paid for every time one of us had to click, it's the only thing that makes sense.
---
I came here to write the exact same thing,  I like to play with a wide POV and this is what I have to deal with if I want to  use the ammo converter  [https://imgur.com/a/dnzLOlC](https://imgur.com/a/dnzLOlC) .  They could at the very least fix this issue
---
Really? I must of not noticed because I was completing other challenges at the same time. 
---
Thanks for clarifying this for me.
---
I got 250 for killing an enraged Grafton monster for the mayor 👍
---
Yea, I’ve been getting him recommended to me a lot here, lol. I’ve only been watching captain noob, i think. Maybe not super informative but entertaining and pretty funny. Thanks man, i get off in 2 hours and that’s top of my to-do list.
---
Herbivore and Carnivore is broken, now all effects on food are affected, so meat food gives no benefits to herbivore but plant foods are double effect, the same with carnivore with meat vs plant foods.
---
Hmm let me browse the sub Reddit .... yep others are :)
---
He probably already exited the vendor.
---
Ammo is such a great earner isn’t it. 
---
It’s funding my mutation serum purchasing so I don’t have to use up points for class freak any more 😅
---
I have about 300k to convert
---
You legend :) it's the usual suspects for me- Protective lining raider,
---
Healing salve CB,
---
Healing salve mire,
---
Walking cane spiked, and the heavy searing sharp rocket sledgehammer.
---
I'm sure there will be more pre-wastelanders plans Im missing bit these are my definite unknowns. I'd love to meet up with the plan mule one day to x-ref!
---
I agree, the actual use of the machine is stupidly complicated. Why can’t this work like a scrip machine?
---
Imagine how good this game could have been if every design aspect wasn't fuled by greed
---
I think they are, I played for a couple of hours and onto level 6 
---
I don’t doubt it will be a grind though but at least there is a bit of structure now
---
For sure would love a remaster for 3 and New Vegas, too bad Bethesda isnt too keen on remasters (unless its a way to resell skyrim for the 8th time) and well I'd rather they focus on fixing all the messes still present in 76 lol
---
Yeah I mean I would love a exchange all or alike a box you can out your ammo in a and click a button but it's early days maybe they will change it maybe not it's been a day and all the hate so they will probably do something about it
---
Just went to reddit to post something like that, but instead just upvoted your post. It's quite bad for gamepad users, but a real fkin nightmare for kb/m users. How could Bethesda come up with literally the worst possible interface for this damned thing!? Why not use the usual trader/stash interface where you can set an amount with a slider?
---
I played about 3 hours yesterday and didn't even grind just finished the Wastelanders quest line on my second char and leveled up to level 4 (clean sink) I think it's pretty easy to level up.
---
I scrapped all junk before i looked, maybe thats why i didn't see it
---
Yea but what about later?
---
How get up to that many intelligence points? I have Unyielding on every piece except helmet and at 20 percent health I'm at around 36 int without any chems? You're talking about almost double that?
---
So upset I spent caps on that mirror and it doesn't reflect, nice game engine.
---
I want to check myself out when I'm in the shitter.
---
Kinda makes me wonder what Fo5 is gonna be like.
---
Okay I tried it with chemist just now instead of ammosmith. It is doing the same thing.i know chemist worked before.  I crafted one stim this morning and got 4. Just now it gave me 3. Bug?
---
It is unlocked at level 5 of the season pass and added to your camp to be built.
---
I already think they did, but in a very trolling way. Because the complaint was that people have way to much ammo in their stash boxes that no one buys, or they don't use, and god dammit give us a way to use it, scrap it, sell it or convert it. 
---
I mean literally they are complaining because they can't stop themselves from picking up something they literally do not need. 
---
So they got something they can do about it. I hope Bethesda never changes it. But they will.
---
your build is fine, sadly shotguns are not (except the bugged ones that one shot everything in vats)
---
.38, .44, .45, and 5mm isn't weightless it's just that it takes 10,000 rds to equal 1 pound.
---
No its not that.Icould have bought it back and also i didnt want it but its a bug im reporting
---
&gt; Anyone else deeply disappointed with the ammo converter? 
---
So you just post here, and don't read anything?
---
The sbq mount was in the menu for like a year before it was released. I also don't think the standered keg is in game yet and that's been out since biv game to game
---
Isnt fo76 before the BOS went from helping people to fanatic tech hoarders
---
Did the download actually show 60GB? It should've been just under 12 GB. Due to the way playstation updates work let's say a game takes 70GB of space... This means that whenever you download an update for said game, the hard drive needs an additional 70GB of space.
---
This space is only used temporarily until the "copying" part of the download is completed.
---
So basically the update can be just 1GB but you still need the 70GB of extra free space for it to download.
---
This is why so many people hate the new CoD. It's a 150GB game that actually needs 300GB of free space any time it updates.
---
Hope this makes sense... just google "ps4 how download copying works" if you're still confused.
---
I learned a little Mandarin (chinese) so i could buy fallout ammo for cheap. Like 200k ultracite rounds for 1usd, i have mules loaded, its just not worth stressing on games like this, i dont have the time to make another character and deal with unrewarding leveling after i've experienced 102% of the game twice
---
You only need 25 more score points per level compared to the previous, if I'm not wrong. I think this works well regarding the things you get and the score Points you recive
---
The wall of posts on the front page not a big enough clue?
---
I honestly dont mind it. I had reservations from comments here and it certainly is a long way from being a well designed interface. I only had to deal with quantities of ammo in the 100s rather than 1000's. Its tedious sure, and I think I will go back to ignoring .44 and .38 ammo and not picking it up, but where it will remain useful to me is for the other shit ammo that gets rewarded like arrows, bolts, .40mm, missiles etc. Those actually stack the points up pretty quickly for low quantities and beats dropping it on the ground. I only unlocked it late in the session though and didnt spend a lot of time with it but Im not as horrified as I thought id be tbh
---
hahahahaha
---
Yeah I was a bit apprehensive too but I am really impressed with how great public teams are being implemented. I like that you can choose categories based on what you want to do. It’s so low-pressure but you all get good rewards for being on a team. This was the fastest I’ve leveled up since double XP. I might always keep myself on a team now, just for those benefits.
---
Even the 3D artist didn't model a functional bolt carrier on the low poly mesh, you could argue that it allows for more space for the other UV islands, but still, it feels really off when you move the charging handle and the bolt carrier is completely static on both sides.
---
The response to this is basically what i’ve become accustomed to as a fallout fan nowadays.
---
There is no winning this. It's not a competition. OMG. please I wish people would open their brains. THERE IS NO WINNING. There is just playing till you don't like it anymore. That's it.
---
Probably won't even bother building mine then...
---
The crafting one seems pretty bad imo. If super duper has a chance to trigger per craft, I‘d rather have 30 chances to get an extra rather than making a batch of 30 and getting only one extra if I’m lucky 🤔
---
You've been missing out on a bunch of atoms my dude, once you do that more team event challenges unlock:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_challenges
---
Complete an Event while in a Group 1 	10 Atoms
---
Complete Events while in a Group 76 	20 Atoms
---
Complete Events in a Group while Wearing Clothing 76 	40  Atoms
---
Complete Events in a Group while Wearing Power Armor 76 	40  Atoms
---
Complete Events in a Group with a Melee Weapon 76 	40  Atoms
---
Complete Events in a Group with a Ranged Weapon 76 	40  Atoms
---
If I remember right complete an event changes to complete 76 events in group, which when completed opens the rest of the - 76 events in a group while x - open simultaneously.
---
Yup you can, it’s really helpful.
---
Ridicolossus
---
You lucky so and so, the drop chance for that reward is literally tiny. 
---
I know how you feel though, I got the responders firemans uniform from tea time last night, and thought it was my birthday!
---
They have trains as hats.
---
One of the new ones is a skin what changed the look of the gun into a ar
---
These fucking clowns.
---
To be fair mirrors working in games is a hard thing to do and for a multiplayer game that lets you place it wherever you want it's basically impossible without causing so many issues. It's not even the engine's fault tbh it's how games are in general when it comes to rendering a mirror's reflections.
---
U complete the world challenge which still give free atoms
---
that sounds great  
---
  
---
waiting for something like this happens to me. i had two dutch 10 years old yelling in their mics. wasnt that nice 😉
---
1 step forward, 20 backwards. That seems to be Bethesda's motto relating to practically everything Fallout.
---
Also, I wish we could trade in some of these rewards for atoms. Like I'm never going to use the Captain Cosmos outfits because they look ridiculous.
---
Tbh if they turned the atoms down to 5 per one challenge I wouldent of mineded
---
Well they can’t all be winners
---
It's called business logic!
---
[https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/architecture/](https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/architecture/)
---
It's classed as a rare drop from the event, along with the helmet, as is the fixer plan. The costume set is classed as uncommon and the white fedora is common.
---
Fairly slow for me unfortunately being high level. Makes me wonder if you could just spam creating a new character as you level up to lv 2 whilst walking through the vault
---
Once again? People have been complaining about numerous issues and bugs from the launch of the game and **they just do no care**.
---
They tend to activate one at a time for me, when I go to Ash Heap. I do once per day, so I don’t know if they can all be activated in the same day.
---
I already completed them all
---
Not really, new players get shafted with ridiculous conversion ratio ....
---
Because events and quests don't give you ammo, right?
---
Ayyyy I know this guy
---
Fair enough, but it should be half the caps then! lol.
---
Think the Plans needs a preview of the item when pressing the inspect key at the vendor.
---
Perhaps he burned down the building? That would explain why they are having so much trouble fixing this game...
---
*after holy sh*t
---
Nah you get it if you played nuclear winter before logging into adventure. It's just a visual bug.
---
What I love about them is how events are filling better but more importantly the fact that even in a one man team, the "Complete events whilst in a group" challenges actually complete. No more waiting around for other people if I don't have time.
---
Yeah, I will never buy them.
---
Yeah I go to ash heap 3 days in a row and all I get is dross toss and chow line. Didn't do them to see if mucker would show on the 3rd day. It didn't. So hence my irritation.
---
They added some locations and events to a couple of them. Could be that it gives you the atoms again once you do those.
---
What i dont understand is that there was a PTS, didnt they get any negative data about it?.
---
full hp
---
I should have stated that...sorry
---
How does it look like with a suppressor?
---
It's the way it is to counter dupers, fuck them.
---
Where did you hit it? If you don't leave one of the nearby sites like v2 or station delta clear no-one will come.
---
You shouldn't even be allowed to put a lock on it, lol.
---
Not really. On Xbox when getting 1000 score but you only got the space for 250 then it doesn't give the score until you complete a smaller challenge to rank up. Only then will it count the additional score that you unlocked.
---
Shop never loads for me anyway. Just spins or says it is offline all of the time 
---
The shop is totally pointless and I don’t understand how they do such a bad job of programming the thing that is supposed to make money.  
---
I live in China as an expat and I’m not sure where more mind boggling stupid things happen, daily China life or Fallout 76 HQ
---
Like in fucking nv dlc.  Or Fallout 3s ammo converter in the dlc
---
Wait does herbivore increase the stats you gain from   food? 0_o well time to change to herbivore if so
---
Op must be new to the game
---
Honestly, as far as I remember there was a machine that did exactly this in Fallout 3‘s The Pitt DLC - except it was actually designed to be usable. 
---
Like, they should know how this is supposed to be - they literally did it already.
---
Never knew, all those wasted caps to pick up globes or clipboard XD thanks
---
I think it's more of a thing where the straw broke the camel's back.
---
This! You should eventually get your rewards. I had this happen to me today and was about to lose my shit when it finally popped at some random moment later on.
---
I find Kit's Killer strings better, also they're updated for patch 20.
---
Your calculations ignore the xp gain and even SCOREs. For around 90 mins of play I got 3000 SCORE from those.
---
You sold something you didn't want to keep, but will be reporting it as a bug?
---
I think you're  confused.
---
You are correct, but that's what the drop button is for. 😄
---
Until then, vending the surplus remains an option.
---
Oh boy, this is going to be fun.
---
Starting with your first point, this is the only one I agree with you on. Many players don't pay attention (and to be fair the game isn't 100% accurate with the notifications) so a lot don't realize they got their points. It doesn't help that instead of taking a moment to look and see if anyone else has the same issue they all immediately make their own thread.
---
Now on the Ammo Converter. You're right that players shouldn't be surprised that they managed to make this item next to worthless, but should we excuse the dev team for it? It's not like it just has low conversion rates. It's UI is absolutely horrendous and deserves to be criticized. Even if it has to be locked into a terminal for whatever reason, it's still designed in the most unintuitive way they could go about it. It's annoying seeing all these posts, yes. But you should be annoyed with Bethesda for screwing this up so bad.
---
I don't know what your issues are but just because you play this game enough to realize there is next to zero meaningful end-game content doesn't mean you have no life. It's not unreasonable to ask that a live service game that they ask people to pay an optional subscription for should at least have something for high level players to do that they actually find engaging and fun. The new Seasons system is just a crappy extension and rework of the original challenge system. It has some good elements sure, but overall nothing was really added except for maybe a reason to grind for exp outside of the future Legendary Perk system. It's just a way to reduce total free Atoms so that the can more aggressively push their FOMO marketing strategy and drive more Atom sales. I'm sure FO1st is looking a lot more attractive to players that don't have a stockpile of Atoms, but still like to buy stuff from the shop.
---
Which brings me to my final point. No one reasonable is mad that they nerfed the quantity of Atoms we receive. The issue that everyone has is how drastic it is. We went from a system that allowed you to easily choose whatever YOU wanted for free provided you put in the work and saved. Now most of what we get for free is chosen for us and we are extremely limited in choosing our own items now; unless we want to shell out real money. If there was a better balance, say weeklys still rewarded their usual Atoms, I think a lot less people would be upset. 
---
Using the argument that global challenges provide plenty of Atoms is terrible considering they never reset and so they provide a very finite amount of atoms and they often require far more effort than what they are actually worth. Yeah, I could kill thousands of robots for a few hundred Atoms with multiple weapon types that I have no interest in and I don't have a build for. I could spend dozens (if not hundreds) of hours searching for each collectable magazine I don't care about for a few hundred more. But the time investment is high and it's simply not fun or engaging. I could go to work for an hour and pay for more Atoms than I'd earn by doing some sets of challenges that would take me far longer than an hour to complete.
---
Clearly, there are literally dozens of other threads bitching, and rightly so as it sucks donkey balls.
---
Hmmm i do remember that Lucky Mucker seemed to be activated less often than usual, now that you mention it. Weird indeed
---
I did a lot of testing in this. so, what one guy said before is true, only having two armor pieces with ‘reduced fall damage’ will make you invincible to fall damage.
---
I managed to avoid death with 1 piece of reduced fall damage armor/rank 2 in goat legs/ bird bones mutation. BUT I still take a lot of damage when falling from really high olaces like the monorail elevator or the flatwoods bridge, but no death. 
---
beware that events that gather lots of players like fasnacht or scorched earth causes a ‘bug’ that makes jet packs incredibly powerful. the excess of players creates some sort of lag that makes your jet pack launch you REALLY high up. I died during fasnacht using it. (but it was fun though)
---
:)
---
I personally don't see the point in trap CAMP's, my CAMP is primarily my home, I don't need it to be a trap for anyone, and I don't need to waste CAMP build limit to add "traps". WTF.
---
Same here, she is still sitting in that bunker.. just.. why? :D
---
Not that I am aware of.
---
No, there isn't.
---
incorrect, heck just a couple of weeks back someone bought over 1000 shotgun shells from me, a few weeks before that my Plasma Cartridges. To say that there is 0 market for buying ammo is just plain ignorant.
---
A random temporary bonus for you and everyone around you. As well as +5% xp.
---
what a shame, but i suppose i'll still get it for the helmet. thanks!
---
What is up with an ammo converter? seems like a great addition.
---
damn shame, but i guess i'll still get it for the helmet. thank you!
---
How did you manage that, ive only managed to get all the dailies done and i think one or two weeklys
---
Did you just level grinding or something?
---
imagine if we actually  had this or  text chat since launch
---
Maybe it was originally intended to be sold on the atom shop (being first announced in [this article](https://bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019) where the paid for QoL items were introduced), similarly to the fridge and collectron bot, so it was made more of a gimmick than something that allows for easily converting huge quantities of ammo to reduce the "pay to win" backlash.
---
You are going to want serendipity, maybe adrenaline and gun fu. You also have things like dodgy to consider. 
---
It looks pretty good though.
---
no i was selling a bunch of different things in a different tab and it sold a weapon
---
Updated my original comment for more clarity.
---
let me guess,
---
you’re an engineer and they are decorators?
---
Wait till you run out of dailies and weeklies, you will see the problem soon enough.
---
It's the first day of the Season. Chill, you have time to finish it
---
Well if they actually made all the ammo useful we wouldn't need a converter.. Seriously like 75% of ammo is useless because the guns are all crap.
---
I played for a few hours and hit lvl 5.  It was day one and I don’t know if I’ll have the same motivation on day 10 to spam these awful events.  I almost finished the weekly’s in the few hours I played which is not hard.  I think the problem with the battle pass, is there’s not enough content in game.  Everything they came up with daily’s and weeklys was stupid easy because well that’s all they could do.  It was nice seeing people at the shitty events but how long will that honestly last before we just group up for do and play solo again
---
Thanks! Not interested in the weapon/armor skins, so got what I wanted already!
---
Can't wait to see all the people running around with the wood ghi... Oh never mind.
---
Could always make your ally wear it lol xD
---
Some are icons other ones are place able in your camp. In the same category as all the other chests are
---
Lucky you for getting them, but I seriously hope that if this is real that it gets patched soon. Allowing players to get these items at anytime now would be a slap in the face to everyone that grinded them out when they were limited rewards.
---
I read the first comment in normal voice. all the others, in a whispering voice.
---
Most people are lazy and don't want to do the queen fight slap bang in the middle of a nuke zone. I think I did my first one there, for lore reasons, but next time leave drop site 9 just outside the nuke zone. 
---
That's what most people seem to prefer. And it's usually busy down there when you do that.
---
Bethesda in a nutshell..
---
Might have bust happened to me actually was checking and swapping perks at WS when I heard the exp sound and it gave me 1k and progressed me on board. Went to check and and no new challenge completion
---
The only thing i cant do is track the xp of anything other than the survivors challenge or w/e the last one was called
---
Yep, you’ll see...
---
Where is the sub reddit?
---
Oh I'm jelly...still working on mine
---
It doesn't seem as though the VTU set is avaliable, but I have gotten about half of the halloween / christmas ones. I can't tell if you can still get them though since I'm at the point it takes a couple of thousand to get the next upgrade and I'm honestly no good at NW, lol.
---
So I find them all in my pip boy in adventure mode?
---
I played, off &amp; on (mostly on except for dinner and a smoke run) since 5pm, it's now 5am and I just completed rank 10. It's definitely not time friendly.
---
The people grinding events is only gonna last for a week or two before people get bored or realize how scummy the whole system is.
---
Um one of the challenges is bubblegum.
---
aaaaand 14 to DR 14 to ER and 14 RR.
---
op underarmor.
---
Back....back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back!!!
---
Are you new here? Papa Todd bathes in our tears like a modern-day Elizabeth Bathory - only twice as sadistic.
---
I finished two of the weekly challenges, got the check marks for both sets of 1000 SCORE points, but haven’t received any score or progress for them. I logged out and back in twice.
---
No, you unlocked plans to build them in your camp and Player icons you can see in the atom shop
---
So they added more world challenges...
---
I didnt know there was a vtu event, cant track anything but the latest one but the xp counting must be messed up because i got 2 of the christmas items over 2 low scoring rounds
---
Stop down voting this comment he’s correct definitely not grindy stop bitching about everything
---
I have noticed these daily limits seem to promote 'come back again later'.  Otherwise I'm carrying around tons of weapon scrip, items that need to be offloaded for caps at a vendor.
---
I'd prefer a bit more information on it. For example, the level at which each unlock is available isn't listed on the board - you have to physically count how far down the board it is. It would also be nice if the game showed the cumulative SCORE you need to reach a certain reward when you hovered over it too.
---
Short answer, no.  
---
Longer answer, no you cannot take a platform specific game disc and use it on a different gaming platform, it's like asking, "Can I play a PS4 game on my mobile phone, if I cut up the disc small enough to insert into the SD card slot.". Duh!
---
Please keep making repeated threads about this topic. I've become addicted and will suffer withdrawal symptoms if I don't see at least 15 threads about the ammo converter on my start page at any time.
---
/s obviously
---
Not sure if the update fixed them or not (it's supposed to be getting fixed soon or already is maybe??) but it all happens in the background with the effects.  With damage numbers turned on my bugged limb damage minigun did 2 damage for each bullet that hit the queen in the HEAD.  That's not good at all....but it could kill her in seconds because the effects were bugging out in the background.
---
Even though I had 2 of these weapons I still used normal guns for public queens because I'm not trying to be a dick and screw other people out of xp/loot lol
---
Meh; for me anything after lvl 5 is extra 😂🤷‍♂️
---
Please elaborate, the quotations killed me
---
No. The season items is gonna be everything that wasnt good enough to make it into the atomic shop.
---
I don't think it's borderline impossible, the guy ignored event SCORE and they are huge (500-1000 per piece). I got around 6k score without weeklies yesterday in 90 mins of normal play (doing the 3 daily missions on 2 characters and doing events for   200 bullions). 
---
That should be around 50k SCORE a week, so done with the whole thing in about 1/3rd of the time available.
---
Its just trash
---
Yes, but now you only need one piece instead of five. It makes it a whole lot more painless when I don't have to hope and pray that I get multiple spawns of it.
---
If only lazy reskins or shit packs were 5 to 12 bucks each. 
---
Fucking 5 dollars for a virtual doormat, stop beeing so blind.
---
I guess it was the level 90 reward. some boss saw it working and order to switch it with the chicken coop
---
It took me a total of about 3 hours to complete every challenge INCLUDING the weekly ones (about an hour for dailies). This is without any cheating/exploiting. For new and/or very casual players I can understand the headache... but anyone with at least a few dozen hours of playtime has no reason to whine. These challenges are incredibly easy to complete albeit having buggy triggers and delayed rewards. Only time will tell if 10 weeks is enough time for the majority of people to reach tier 100.
---
Just remember that these tiered systems aren't necessarily designed so that every single player can easily get every reward... in that case the rewards lose their exclusivity and therefore their value/luster.
---
All that being said, shame on you Bethesda for screwing people out of thousands of free atoms. That's a real dick slap in the face especially for roleplayers/builders.
---
They recycled the ammo manufacturing terminal from fallout 4. Simples
---
I’m all for it as I have some xbox buddies that play and I’m on pc,  but it’ll never happen.  I mean we still can get txt chat which is ridiculous.
---
Cant you turn that off by toggling UI mode while youve got the pip boy open? When I interact with terminals it just opens a square overlay, not the screen itself. Also happens automatically if you try to use a terminal someone else is using.
---
Is that what you are referring to?
---
People dont realize that just because its a "Building Team" it doesnt mean that you HAVE to build. You just reap the benefits from the team and play however you normally would otherwise.
---
Those Vault-Tec junk supply caches count too.
---
There is only loosing, and you can only loose by not getting to 100. No Cake For You.
---
I thought we were supposed to get two other skins for this gun?
---
Lol casuals. Someone's done the math and literally doing all the simple dailies every day and weeklys every week will get you almost the entire way there by the end of the Season. Actually play the game throughout that time and earn exp and the rest of the SCORE will come easily and naturally. If you can't log in everyday you can either A) work harder getting exp on the days you do play. B) spend some Atoms to rank up. Or C) suck it up because if you can't put in the effort you aren't entitled to every single limited time reward. It's not like any of this is hidden behind some bullshit ridiculous RNG or insane time-gate. You put in the work and grind and you get the rewards.
---
Possible? Maybe. But you'll have to gain like 7000 levels.
---
In a weird way this is a relief for me. I wasn't expecting to make it to 100, which would mean I wouldn't feel obliged to be logging in every single day. Then early after the update it looked like it might be possible with the rate SCORE built up, which caused me to start feeling pressure, and a little bit of stress, to get log in every day and try to get everything done (which is probably Bethesda's intention). But now I know that I almost certainly wouldn't make 100 anyway - I may have already screwed myself by not doing the nuclear winter challenge yesterday - so I can relax and go back to trundling up the SCOREboard and seeing how high I get.
---
Look up the word 'Irony'. You are literally complaining about complaining. I would rather see complaint posts that contain some level of constructive criticism than posts like this.
---
this is pretty much the truth. I for example play some other games alongside F76, so I won't lose the will to play F76. I think it's a great game and if bgs keeps it up it stays a great game.
---
Ah so the crates themselves have nothing in them? Cos I just saw one called epic crate
---
Been playing since roughly 5pm, turned my Xbox off at 5am. Only took a dinner break, did a few NW matches to get some of the Christmas stuff, and ran for cigs. Just reached rank 10 and finally completed all the daily/weekly requirements. Not looking forward at all to how bad this grind is going to suck if day one took me 10 hours to complete.
---
I laughed with my fist in my mouth
---
Daily challenge =/= daily event. 
---
You need to do 5 SCORE challenges (used to be the atom challenges) from the map menu. You probably did 8 daily events from the pip boy menu.
---
These are basically the crates you find in NW, just as a placeable camp item
---
Had a guy at  two straight events explaining how to still do it.  It’s still there
---
Hold b down to exit all the endless menus
---
Not looking likely, no. The scaling is such that you basically have to do every single daily (minus NW), every single weekly, and still grind 250ish levels (at level 100+) over the next 10 weeks to wrap the season.
---
Now of course, the board has 9 spots which give 150 Atoms, and you could burn those on the last 9 SCORE ranks too, which would be the best bang-for-buck.
---
Either way, I think mid-July is doubtful for the vast majority of people.
---
I can't say with 100% certainty but I think the exp requirements for the first two Holiday Season rewards were really low. I know at least one of the past events had such low requirements for the first couple items it basically amounted to "join a match and don't be the very first person to die".
---
It's also bugged, you can't use it while in power armour.
---
Ah ty
---
They’ve fixed loads of stuff. Some people just like to moan and whine and are never happy🥳🥳
---
It is. Assuming it does end up scaling linearly for the whole thing then doing all the challenges will put you ~5k short but you'll more than make up for it through the xp you get just while doing them. Throw in events as well (might be bugged currently, some give score others don't) and if you play consistently you should make it pretty comfortably. Still pretty grindy but it's far from impossible without paying.
---
I just found out dont use the mouse but the keyboard and you can spam it. I do agree to the post though. I dont blame them either tbh. If you get home from a bad day at work you dont want to spend more time or effort on it, lol.
---
#ChangeMyMind
---
Dodgy perk in agility helps with that, or serendipity in luck.  Just depends where you have points to spare.  Also as someone else mentioned the endurance perk lifegiver will bug out and regenerate your health.  Using lifegiver and dodgy the only times I die are due to me fumbling around and failing to stim myself when poison damage is draining my health bar.
---
And also just being generally stupid and getting myself nuked gets me killed too lol.
---
Not just being a terminal. The sheer amount of ammo you can convert is ridiculous 😂 would be there forever if I actually used the thing properly as intended.
---
The problem is with the challenges that have multiple requirements, you only get the main line on the map and not the individual requirements.
---
Yea now imagine doing it on console
---
That could be it
---
Why do I picture Team America World Police
---
the mascot set I usually sell for 100 caps each, outfit and head.
---
the imposter one for 1000 caps each.
---
fair enough.

The current alternative is just a small screen   like so  [https://imgur.com/a/aEtkGAL](https://imgur.com/a/aEtkGAL) .  I am talking about actually using the whole screen  to provide us a better ui experience, with  more categories  and sorting options like skyUI , which you can  check how it works here:  [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863)  . I started replaying skyrim a few days  ago and was astonished at how a simple mod can vastly improve my whole gaming experience.   I frankly don't understand how bethesda didn't adopt that UI system themselves.
---
because you only gave me 2 options, read your own title
---
u actually are fucking stupid
---
I would say yes.
---
I got about 3 or 4 items for winning a match. It was quite funny as I only intended to spam stins in the fire but everyone else died while I waited.
---
Don't forget to put on the inspirational perk (+15% xp), get the herd mentality mutation (+2 to all special if grouped), stack with strange in numbers.
---
You also get some of those lunchboxes which give +25% XP for an hour - if you open one near other people they all get the bonus too
---
I like how everyone is complaining about a free, somewhat useful object the day after release.
---
not really doing nothing but i got score twice while cooking some meat. didnt see any cooking related challenges, quite strange.
---
Yes. Every 1 int is about 2% XP buff on every XP reward.
---
Maan I'm going on vacation for 2 weeks, I can say goodbye to the level 100? :(
---
What I'm saying is that if everyone can make their own 5.56 or whatever out of 10mm and .38 then why are they going to buy the 5.56 in my vending machine. As a melee, I make a ton of money off selling those.
---
This whole thing just feels like a chore
---
Was my intent to but my fire plan didnt work so i switched to fall damage and grenades, was able to launch an fu nuke on my second round too
---
Once we claim them, where do we go to scrap them? Where is it in our inventory
---
The atoms reward usually works itself out in a couple of days. Whereas the other rewards, I just reset my fallout and the atom shop took a while to load then it showed 1st rewards
---
It gives score points before you actually complete the challenge. Check your total score
---
I was shocked too dude. Seriously right ? They expect us to convert 18 .38 then it throws you back to the main screen lol we would be there all damn day at that rate
---
Okay so its a style of helmet that when you wear the combat armor helmet it changes the look of it to a leather pilot helmet? i dont know whats its called but it looks nothing like what a 'mountain scout' would wear, the icon needs fixing but im just going to put that out there
---
since you already opened all three: does the +xp stack? did you get +15%? i dont think it works like that but as you did it already....
---
I'm using mine as decoration.
---
While it would be cool if they add new guns, I’ve already got the perfect B3325 handmade for my build. I’m fully convinced I’m never going to get the  b3325 effect on any other weapon (Had to trade for the one I got.) so I’d much rather new rifles be skins for the handmade so I don’t have to get these perfect rolls on another weapon.
---
Where did you enter from??
---
Same for me, it took a while to load but now even when I go on the atom shop normally it just says it’s gone down. I assume it’s due to the fact It’s the first day of seasons so a lot of people are accessing it
---
What is this glitch for ward? Asking for a friend.
---
Its free. People are acting like they wasted £20 on it
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge.
---
The ones we're allowed to talk about here without getting moderated are the kind of fun bugs that bethesda would take out of the game so my lips are sealed. My advice is to join a public team with high level people &amp; go to all the events you can, I'm sure you'll come across some.
---
Yeah, probably. The whole game has been quite laggy since seasons.
---
The issue wasn't that we were getting too many free Atoms or that the items were to expensive. The issue is that the quality of the Atom shop items are usually low and most players have no interest in them anyway. The items that people do want are so few and far between that the average player would easily be able to stockpile enough Atoms for what they really want. 
---
If they bombarded us with great items every week or at the very least the things people have actually been asking for, players would on average have much fewer Atoms and would be much more likely to shell out real money when another amazing item comes out that they really want.
---
Its worse until people not join this team at all)
---
From memory (logged out and no longer have it), it goes in the junk menu but doesn't auto-scrap when you use the scrap all function at a workbench.
---
i’d say more common the chances of you just getting that lucky are slim
---
So... in batches every 27 years? 🤔
---
i get the need to vent. but can you elaborate a bit? what happened?
---
There's a wendigo colossus plushie. I want one :/
---
Apparently most people estimate it to be some 10 years to go for FO5, if thats the case I dont think I could imagine what its gonna be like lol!
---
Ah, thank you for your help!
---
Not as I'm aware however under combat there is a new set of KILL challenges.
---
If that was their intend I don't even want to see their next steps...can't wait for Patch 21 with vendors requiring you to wait for 2hrs for every sell/buy transaction.
---
There's a limit between stopping dupers and harrassing/inconveniencing players...the machine has clearly crossed the line
---
Yeah that's what I presumed. Unfortunate for all the people who have paid a fortune for them
---
They double their respective reward and nullify the opposite.
---
I agree its annoying but honestly its the only way Bethesda will even pay attention to an issue
---
This post exploded.
---
I don't know the sales numbers, but I wouldn't be too surprised if they had less to lose doing Fallout 76 than Elder Scrolls 76. It appears they may have felt that branching out into online/multiplayer/games-as-a-service was risky (it was) and could damage the reputation of the studio and/or the franchise the game was set in (it did), so they might have felt that if they were to make some mistakes like they did, it would be the lesser of two evils to damage Fallout than to damage The Elder Scrolls. You don't fuck with the golden goose. Fallout is good, but I'm guessing it's not quite as lucrative as TES.
---
Once you've gone through the wastelanders story arc, you start acquiring treasury notes which can be exchanged for gold bullion. Feed the people is one of the events that gives treasury notes (so does tea time, which is why that suddenly now had lots of high levels).
---
Combine the fact that feed the people is pretty much unfailable, gives treasury notes, doesnt require any real resources (you can just punch everything) AND gives +XP canned stew which doesnt go off (cranberry juice/cobbler gives similar effect but you cant stockpile it due to decaying condition)
---
Under junk
---
There's so many examples I could give for this unfortunately. After every patch we get one or two bugs ironed out and fixed, and then we get two or three news ones that come along when the patch releases. It's like one step forward, two steps back. 
---
If I was bothered I could go back through all the patches and find the bugs that cropped up afterwards but it'd take too long.
---
they are rewarded in a bundle. the jumpsuits and the masks. they can be rewarded in events in the savage divide or any the messenger. but when you get them they dont show up in the reward list for completing the event. 
---
you are extremely lucky, m8! 
---
I used dodgy for a bit on my heavy. It killed my AP when fighting scorchbeast or large groups. I was told to swap bloody mess instead of serendipity, but without emergency protocols, seems like I need it.
---
Are you sure about what you're saying? I'm a bit worried because I'll lose like 10 day worth of daylies because I'm going on vacation
---
You're lucky. That's a rare reward for the savage divide events,  only place you can get it now since they fucked up the spawns at the enclave vendor and at enclave events.
---
Publix events should be giving SCORE. Someone said they got 1000 just from Scorched Earth.
---
Yeah I stopped playing this game religiously a few weeks ago and thank god I did. This game has so much bugs compared to other games. It’s still a good game though.
---
Press „X“ to doubt
---
Yeah they HAVE to!
---
And yeah I read that. Could have been one of the other rewards tho... but we will have to wait and see i guess.
---
I think I get what you mean, sorting options that work I especially feel you on.
---
Currently the UI to me seems fine for a console, but for players on PC I understand the current setup is pretty poor.
---
Are PC players allowed to install UI mods or does the game spaz out at them for playing with that?
---
Now do it about 10-25 times to earn one rank
---
Why? It is very easy to gain a new reward and at least is something new.
---
Now try tasty squirrel stew for a nice 20% xp buff
---
Naw man
---
Still
---
Gunna use raider for me 3 p 3 a
---
Ah, that is interesting tip, thanks!
---
Im guessing he moves once a day, there is 70 days in 10 weeks yadda yadda he starts at thirty... Two....
---
I'm shocked how we can have a 'trading' interface for most stuff even the gold bullion machine....but THIS machine...nope they had to choose the most annoying way possible as if they had no idea what other interfaces they already had in use...
---
Yeah Im not going to even bother to hard. The fireplace door is neat. But after the pip boy paint I don't really care about anything
---
Thanks for all the advice!
---
There is a trash can on fire already ;)
---
Maybe I am stupid but how do I create an "empty" group?
---
That makes more sense, I didn't realise they came in a bundle. Thanks for the info :)
---
Having to do the same limited things everyday isn't fun and WILL become a chore.
---
Doesn't give points at all
---
I have only used it once and it's way to slow to process
---
How ridiculous. You don't need to be able to make a video game yourself to recognize unbelievable tedium and an utter lack of understanding of how a game feature should be designed. The ammo converter is undeniably hot garbage.
---
Idk i think you can tighten it up in addition to loosening it. Just remember, Lefty loosey, righty tighty
---
Criticism of companies is necessary in order to influence quality of products being released. If customers don’t like something, I think they should absolutely try to let the producer know, that way it can be fixed or future releases will be better. Just think about how bad 76 would be today if it hadn’t received any criticism since launch and people just accepted it because they didn’t want to seem “entitled”
---
Are these separate score gains from repeatable 10k exp challenge?
---
How much score exp do you get from events?
---
A ammo converter converter - Coming in season 2!
---
I knew they were rare but I didn't realise they got rewarded in a bundle. I just thought they were multiple strokes of luck haha.
---
I have an instigating handmade, but after a mob is below full hp, doesn’t it become sort of useless?  I could see using it to pick off the spawned adds, but after that, wouldn’t something else be better?
---
The developers never did listen to the community in the first place, it's evident in what we're experiencing playing this game. But let us for the sake of the argument and give you the benefit of doubt, say that they actually did read posts frequently posted in here, how likely would you be to open for feedback if they mainly consisted of a 1000 posts made within an hour with little to no constructive feedback, but literally only trashing of entirely FREE content?   
---
Let's say that you put a lot of time and effort into making and baking apple pies and gave it to a community center, just for the sake of being friendly and nice, without expecting anything in return for your time and inconvenience, only to be receiving a lot of hateful letters of how they didn't like your apple pie, none of these letters would of couyrse be constructive and tell you how'd you might improve the apple pie, but just literally trash talk about it, and then further complaints on why you didn't bring them steaks and wine either? How would you receive those letters?
---
No, we can complain whenever we want. The ammo converter is essentially the developer trolling us. It could be a simple, streamlined interface but instead it's utter madness.
---
And we still know nothing about either of these projects, right? It seems like whiplash since with Fallout 4 and 76 they made the true announcements much closer to release, but with ES6 and Starfield we literally have no clue.
---
I get not wanting to misplace expectations, but when they know people are growing extremely skeptical it may be in their best interest to reassure us with evidence. Unless both games really are that early in development, in which case they might be in a deeper hole than they want to admit.
---
i think the only way to get this changed is to talk to the bethesda people in this subred and KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT 
---
when they ignore, and yes that will happen, we must stay strong and let our keyboard smashes be heard where we all express our frustration at this so called ammo converter where it's like hacking a lvl 3 computer before you can actually convert ammo 
---
pls lets get the ammo we all deserve
---
I'm level 9 now and did 3 or 4 weeklies, so yeah, I got 6k SCORE from dailies and events.
---
That's the one I go get in a pinch!
---
Because it’s Christmas and Santa is here. Jingle bells fallout is great Todd Howard laid a nuka Christmas special cola. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Not all of them are xp some of them are perks like confetti mess enemies will blow up with confetti pieces.
---
I spent 35mins with that janky menu then dumped the rest of my ammo next to it &amp; deleted the machine. I wanted this so badly &amp; it is unusable unless you are under lvl 20 &amp; desperate for ammo
---
From which events? I did a bunch of events today and didn’t get score from any of them.
---
Not if nobody will join your team (Most don't know how Int works). Herd mentality with strange in numbers gives +3 Int combined with egg head the bonus of just having teammates out weighs the 4 Int until people know.
---
Because bethesda dosent know how to bug test stuff properly.
---
Yeah, I have 8000 10mm ammo and I'm able to convert it 24 pieces at a time, which is BS. 
---
Main menu.
---
Click.
---
Convert.
---
Yo I hate the grind and rng in FO76 with a passion but if every legendary was a home run there would be no point. It would completely crash and ruin the in game economy and everyone will be a variable god. Beth has no interest in making it easier to get good legendaries. The perfect example of this is the Stalker effect dropping on melee weapons. More vats accuracy with more vats cost if not in combat? Absolutely useless on a melee weapon, yet is has remained unchanged since beta. Where as we see weapons such as the criminally underpowered energy weapon line up, harpoons and dragons get the explosive effect removed and TSE weapons nerfed into oblivion becoming worse than Anti armour weapons. Beth is unfortunately a AAA company run by FFF accountants with an unfortunately undermined dev team. They want goin to keep chasing that perfect legendary roll, legendary farming, logging on daily for the purveyor and bullion and hopefully buying some atoms along the way.
---
Because the update added a ton of weird bugs to the game and just flat out broke other stuff.  You can also get Halloween rewards from nuclear winter right now from what I understand.
---
But seriously was it a nw event
---
Oh thanks, good luck in the wastelands
---
This reply as been the best thing about the ammo converter 😁 lol thanks bud
---
But are they from a previous event
---
Really woweewow. No I did it from the map and no its stuck
---
Damn weird
---
Didnt realise this from release state lol?
---
I run a stealth commando atm and it saves me too often for me to consider dropping it. I hear you on dodgy, and i don't run it currently, bear in mind that with full uny armor though you will have shed loads of AP compared to PA.
---
Ok? You had to participate in daily weekly challenges before. 
---
What kind of things did you buy with atoms before?
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll swap some 308 for some* of your 38 / 10mm.....I use these types in BFFR pipe and 10mm SMG respectively and they work well. 308 I don’t use at all these days outside of my heavy gunner and then only Ultracite 308
---
*some as character in question has 3 strength and doesn’t use weight perks
---
They give 25% XP to you and everyone around you
---
The gap between offering constructive feedback and trash talking is huge.   
---
Basically ALL of the posts so far about ENTIRELY FREE CONTENT consists of "this is shit, it doesn't pamper my baby needs nailed down to an exact tee, and I don't care about the free content, I HATE IT"   
---
Everyone expects perfection and everything to be free all at once, or they'll riot and trash talk like kids. You can still offer constructive feedback without being self-entitled, but 99,99% of this community couldn't tell by the looks of it.
---
I just got it and didn't think it would be as bad as most say it is, but the interface is terrible.
---
It needs a slider or something that allows multiple deposits.
---
I enjoyed the free ammo I converted, but it's almost not worth the time to use it.
---
Depends on the event, for the easy ones I got 200, 500 for the medium ones and 1000 for the hards. I also read somewhere that a guy got 2000 from radiation rumble.
---
Also, since we are talking about bethesda I'm fairly sure someone will find a way to glitch SCORE and complete the whole thing in a week.
---
Build up your camp is different than take 1 workshop
---
If you look in my post history this exact things happened to me.
---
I completely agree with you. All these people do is cry. My kid pays $10 every time a new season drops in Fortnite just to unlock things. In the two and a half hours I played last night I was able to get 600 rounds of .50 cal out of the ammo machine. I was pretty happy with that.
---
I like this, people are whining about the ammo converter which I get but atleast we have it now. I like the skins and lunchboxes and stuff we get, I think it’s cool to finally do challenges that give you stuff. I’m personally excited for the coveted planetarium at the 100 spot
---
You really expect they add working ammo converter and we should convert millions of ammo? Still there will be daily cap to make it basically useless. Even when they fix UI still useless. 
---
They never make collecting Atoms like before, because for mine experience, just casual playing i can get previously basically one bundle every month for free because you play the game and somehow you get atoms to buy it. Nerfing ATOMS is logical step.  As soon as players complete missions and step into "end-game" they should have enough atoms to buy multiple bundles and they stop playing anyway = no money for Bugesda. 
---
yes there is no real end game content but making content easier doesn't fix it. 
---
As soon as they start adding OP items, game changing items for ATOMS, then will be problem. But now with textures and useless items for camp, come on...
---
The glare is on ps4 as well. Most of the purchased floors from the Atomic store have significant glare on them...almost white looking.
---
Yep I have ammosmith maxed and super duper, I literally never run out of ammo and I just chuck the .38 and .308 on the floor. A run in luckyhole mine gives so much lead I can make ammo that will last for days.
---
You can hit things with vats with the gauss shotgun? Since the new patch came out I can't hit anything at all now
---
The criticism is warranted as its a decent enough idea ruined by poor ui design. 
---
But there's a difference between a disappointing grain and a 'death threat' post, and sadly Reddit is know for the extreme Fanboy vs Hater community and so balanced criticism is rare.
---
FYI I'm one of the 'oldies' (not old, just not a teen anymore either) and I guarantee in earlier days it was just as bad except no/younger Internet to voice dissatisfaction.
---
In that case if you screenshot your daily "atom" challenges, showing 5 complete but only 4 showing on the Gold Medal challenge and send it to Beth they will sort it out.
---
I'd be interested to see it too.
---
Ah, so probably 250 SCORE exp per level of the event, with level 4 being the SBQ, Encryptid and Radiation Rumble (1 Banknote per level)
---
Speaking of Encryptid... =)
---
Its very much drop in and out. You can join, and drop out at any time. Anyone can join a team as long as there's a spare slot.
---
You get the base bonus from simply being on a team. That goes up to x4 if everyone is "bonded"
---
Becoming requires you to simply be on the team for a certain amount of time (you dont need to do anything else). Becoming bonded doesnt take very long at all; 2-3 mins at a guestimate.
---
You also dont even need to do anything with the other members if you dont want. The "events" team, since the bonus is for completing events, are probably likely to go to events, but otherwise its do what you want really
---
honestly this was predictable, make the full season impossible to finish without paying.... that s ridiculous. 
---
No atoms from the dailies now and low atoms from the season rewards so guaranted paywall for end season yaaay! --'
---
Yeah just had a skyrim glitch of falling from the sky scorchbeast at my camp that I killed in the SBQ event but Yup I'm ungrateful
---
Honest question: how many of you that really hate the converter are high-level/endgame players? How many are on PC? Maybe I'm just on at weird times (9am-1pm), but I never see any return on the hundreds of rounds in my vendor machine, and if I can spend ten minutes converting my 700 or so syringes to 5.56 or 10mm, it's worth it to me. Not to mention my 1500 shotgun shells...
---
Right? They used the same system for the gold bullion system but apparently already forgot what they coded a few months ago.
---
Somebody suggested it could be a attempt for them to stop duping which if true I would call one of the worst ways, that's like putting a whole city under police lockdown because there's a jewelry store in town that 'could' be robbed. Dupers already have their ways of duping ammo anyway they don't need the burden of a ammo machine for it.
---
That bundle is like rocking horse shit mate, very lucky indeed.
---
You are very delusional.  
---
Lets say I Promise you to give you OREO, but I replace creamy filling with toothpaste.   
---
You are fed up, right ? You expected tasty and edible OREO but you get something with toothpaste.   
---
I tried my best, I spend whole weekend making toothpaste OREO for everyone and you start bashing me ... nobody said it would be edible, but you somehow expected it wrong  
---
Think about it mate :)
---
I am also way beyond being a teen myself, and I guarantee you even in earlier days it was never this bad and people were not at all close to feeling entitled to everything as we see in recent years, and this is coming from over 2 decades worth of experience.
---
Dude you probably just have that one serum
---
Could always use more. Not every gun irl looks exactly the same. What’s wrong with variety?
---
Ok so how do i get one / is it from raiders cos im
---
Only neighbourly atm
---
Yeah, most definitely. Has the best DR/ER/RR in the game outside power armour.
---
U can generate a lot of ammo withing seconds. The ammo converter is a useless toy. I understand if u can change 5mm to .50  as 1 for 1. But no. So, no matter how the UI is implemented the changing rate tells u everything about uselessness of this garbage.
---
Imagine how good this company could have been if they weren't fueled by greed
---
ahahah
---
No. 8% bonus is NOTHING compared to serverhopping Westtek.. good luck coordinating that with a full team.
---
Rank 5. I was rank 4 yesterday and it didn't unlock.
---
$$$ it could be a sign that they are desperate for income and being pressured by Zenimax, trying to force players to buy Atoms with $$$
---
Ok thank you. Can you get legendary versions?
---
You’re the one that’s completely delusional.
---
First of all, they promised you no more than Fallout 76, at release they never said anything that should lead you on to believe NOR expect that anything in the future would be free, nothing. 
---
You then get additional free content, more than what’s originally was promised, and you still feel the strong sense of self entitlement and being wronged for not catering to your exact needs and wants?
---
Son, you need to grow up and see how the real world works.
---
I was looking forward to this but now I cant even bring myself to start the fucking game
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug. Didn’t see anything in patch notes saying it changed.
---
Wtf Bethesda i don't have time to play 5 hours a day just to complete the dailies
---
If you think it's just *one* little thing, you've not been paying attention.
---
thats true, what an exciting functionnality! pretty glad we have that now
---
Indeed, you need to buy legendary modules from the purveyor to make them, so they are all legendary. Sadly the aren't tradeable though, but you can scrip them.
---
Trying to bury the bones without a shovel equipped spawns one behind the tree that's right there if there's no shovel beside the grave.
---
Making bulk junk also works.
---
Saved up the free Atoms for camp bundles, bought the Contemporary House set, bought the Vault-Tek set, and the Red Rocket Ranger set. One wallpaper set, forget the name but it's vintage wallpapers. And bought the light wood floor. Now I'm saving for the set that's in there right now that has the vault stairs, only want it for those clean stairs and the globe.
---
No you’re just a moaner.
---
oh ok. thanks!
---
I like the way you think! :)
---
hey atleast those guys were honest enough to acknowledge they fucked up at launch, remade the game and relaunched it, similar to ESO back then.
---
Fo76's team is more like chef Sunny's "Oh no I fucked up....No it gets sold anyway!"
---
Yup! Makes challenges super easy
---
Any workbench. They are under junk
---
Also the seasons\*
---
If someone mails a box of dog shit to your front porch,  are you gonna receive it and say "might as well accept muh free stuff"? I would go on but I cant see how this isnt a troll or bait post...
---
Which Pip boy skin do you mean?
---
Damn straight there's TONS on the board easily worth a chunk of atoms.
---
personally i havent had any issues this patch. even though i've been online since it released until about 40 minutes ago.
---
Pepperoni Roll also doubled to +60 carry weight.
---
The word “season” signifies a limited even that will be a month or two. Every other game charges $25 a season to participate.
---
Ultimately designed to generate more micro-transactions. It's not really free, it's free-mium. If you want to complete it you gotta buy atoms.
---
Pretty sure it's a glitch, but some people have said they did get some for Encryptid and Scprched Earth. Do you remember which you did?
---
Wouldnt have ascended that high because mr T hates flyin'
---
Where do you find the bullion to put in your stash???
---
So, I wasn't expecting to get to 100 on this, (I definitely wasn't intending to play every single day for the next 10 weeks,) and hearing that that is indeed the case is a relief in a strange way. It's like there's no stress or pressure if getting to 100 is going to be difficult even for those who'll be putting in multiple hours daily.
---
There is still a level I'd like to get to - 56 for that funky wallpaper, though if I do get that high I'll probably try to get to 58 for the X-01 skin - but I'll just see how I go. Just level 6 so far on a couple of hours play last night.
---
Judging by those things I’m surprised you didn’t like anything in the season. 
---
Anyway everyone has their own tastes. Maybe you’ll like more things in the next season?
---
At least challenges are easier now so you don’t need to spend as much time doing them.
---
im selling my acc i agree with you but this game is ass and i regret the 500 hours ive put into it
---
Seems like every single thing in this patch was botched and while the ammo converter was the most sought for item in the season rewards list I don't even want to see how little time they invested in the rest of the rewards.
---
You can clearly see the motivation of Bethesda's devs if they give up at the 3rd/4th item in a list of hundreds
---
Hmm. Maybe switching team type between hunting events and building depending on your circumstances
---
Funny those are two I've been doing all day, so I had no idea what people were talking about. That explains it. Thank you.
---
Not on PC because the cursor jumps about
---
Literally developing RSI in their player's fingers.
---
They really don't give a shit, that much is clear, it's all about the $$$
---
Could have just been delay from something earlier. Are you tracking your challenges?
---
Public Events.
---
Your example doesn't even make sense in this instance.   
---
No one forces you to make use of the ammo converter, you were not even promised free season rewards nor additional items / content beyond what you got from the original FO76. Yet you're still think you're entitled to be crying over it?   
---
I know this is  beyond your comprehension despite the level of this topic isn't being overtly complex.
---
I really hate this mentality. You lose literally nothing if other people can have those skins.
---
I like the ammo converter, but the menu is clunky and cumbersome.  Perhaps they can add more ammo trade in options, like 100 rounds at a time
---
Yeah it sucks, I've been proclaiming Beth is more likely to lose players to the grind rather than boosts daily engagement for the longest time but stopped cos it was karma suicide lol
---
This is not planned. It's a bug. There's double buffs for both carnivore and herbivore on their respective mutations but doesn't register any special/xp buffs on the other side
---
Wait i have that machine...
---
Totally, I'll not reinstall it unless they completely overhaul it. Back to dumping ammo multiple times a day
---
I'm on PC I use the activate button to select menu items and haven't had an issue. I also only hold one ammo type at a time while doing it (sorry didn't specify)
---
I actually think it’s because of Obsidian. They are the ones that made it in Fallout New Vegas. That’s the only reason i could see
---
FALSE ALARM. STANDING DOWN.
---
\*rollingeyes\*
---
killed the client, startet it new... everythings ok. sorry for spreading panic ;)
---
or maybe let a useless build-limited machine like that consume no camp budget at all in order to get people to build it.
---
same it is awful
---
I havent played this game in a while, since TSE meta. Whats actually the problem with dupers? Its not like what they do affects other players, right? I mean if they dupe god rolled items and you want to farm for those items instead of getting them from dupers, you can. Why does them having duped stuff affect you?
---
Bethesdas actions against dupers in a game that doesn't need action against dupers seems to be the issue. Its not like the dupers have an advantage over me, I play in pacifist. I dont do PvP. Hell, Bethesda doesn't even make money off of items that people dupe. Its not like in GTA when someone dupes a car and sells it, that affects shark card sales. What the big deal? Am I missing something?
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHH!! They're watching!
---
I wanted to spend some time getting the Xmas and Halloween stuff I missed before they fix it 😜
---
To confirm I didn't get any of the stuff last year and so far I've been getting everything from both as I gain xp! Woohoo!
---
Imagine if epic games gave away the fortnite battle pass for free every season, they would have to rely on the store to make money from the game. Its the same with fo76, people don't realise that store and fo1st purchases keep the game going.
---
Oh shit yeah lemmie delete the post
---
Hows that Fallout 1st treating ya? 🤣
---
They did say beforehand that all the seasons will be completely free in the future, so there's that at least.
---
The first one. It's at like r8bor something. It'll go well with my outcast pa paint
---
Messing with new perks because they somehow broke the adrenaline perk.  
---
Leveling up in the new system quickly because you don't even need to complete the whole challenge before it gives you the points....
---
 When I hear a major update is coming this is pretty much what I expect now lol.
---
oh wait was that the one with the factory conveyor belts and other stuff?
---
What’s Fallout 1st got to do with it?
---
Bingo
---
Online since it released until 40 minutes ago? Considering it released yesterday (or, the servers came back online) at about 19:00 GMT, and it's now 11:15 AM... You're telling me you played for 15 hours straight? AND you encountered no bugs?
---
There's plenty of other people who are having issues. Personally, since the patch, I'm having more rubberbanding problems than before, and also have noticed issues with my Stimpak perks, which was an issue I didn't have prior to the patch.
---
I just want to farm my way to the secret service camo skin, then id have all i wanted out of season 1
---
When you are burned out you can go buy some cool relaxing retail therapy in the Atom store mmmm! 😋 Atom store toot so delicious.
---
2 of my weeklies are done.... Without giving xp... Already sent a ticket to bethesda support with the screenshot... Have a bad feeling that means an extra 20 times doing the 10k xp
---
Happy Cake day fellow dweller!
---
You've got some time too. Heck I'll be happy with just the blue completed! Ghillie Rifle and Backpack in just the first section.
---
We're lucky they even give us atoms in the season pass.
---
Wtf, why do they let you buy it again?
---
No one understands that microtransaction shops are there to keep the game running. If no one pays, the game will eventually be shutdown.
---
You sure you’re not just completing challenges or hitting the 10K experience while doing them? Because I’ve done Project Paradise, Uranium Fever and Free Range twice and got zero score from any of them.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/9i7z8lc
---
i got no score for running these yesterday:
---
- 2 scorched earth
---
- 1 encrypted
---
- 1 feed the people
---
- 1 swarm of suitors 
---
- 2 lode bearing
---
Cant really help with the toilet unless you wanna fuck with mods, but usually when I do showers, I stick a bathtub inside of a decon shower.
---
Just have fun in Appalachia, hope you‘ve brought some patience along.
---
They’ve appeared now, to anyone else who has the same problem you just have to wait a bit.
---
Honestly even the quality of the armor aside I'd get it just for the jetpack on non-powered armor.
---
Fair point!
---
People enjoy complaining.  I havent tried it yet but if you did 10k ammo in that time it doesn't seem all that bad!  
---
Maybe now I can get rid of all that 38 I have laying around.
---
Yah dude. I already went through this once with Archage. Never again.
---
That just sounds like picking up ammo you don't need, with extra steps.
---
Who pissed in your razorgrain soup
---
I noticed earlier today that they had fast travel icons instead of the usual workshop ones. Might have something to do with that- Pretty sure it's back to normal now on the icons/being able to fast travel there without owning them tho.
---
Still. The point stands. The people who play the PTS probably get big ups from. Bethesda etc or are ass-lickers who will never say a bad word about the game
---
Laughs in 40mm ec, .50 Cal ball and cannonballs
---
Bethesda... 🤷‍♂️
---
That’s the first thing I tried when I got on I was like I’m not going to go around and fine things that have 35 aluminum
---
Are they perhaps pulling in devs from exactly that part of the industry?
---
Definitely room for massive improvement, but it's only sooo bad now because people have thousands of ammo. Once it's all cleared and we're using it daily it'll hundreds max.
---
Check the helmet for mold before displaying it.
---
this sounds oddly specific. did something happen to your helmet?
---
If you put 500 hours into a game then you must of enjoyed it at some point. Only a lunatic would put that much time into a game they hate.
---
Can someone elaborate this i am a little confused.
---
THANK YOU!!!! once you figure out how to use it without going through the whole menu every time it’s super quick and easy. I converted thousands of rounds in no time, you just click convert and then the back button, rinse and repeat. People just love bitching but I’m liking mine
---
smelting my lead ore, e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e etc
---
RSI incoming!
---
no like i said the people i have friends that really enjoy the game that kinda made me forget the awful game
---
I agree. Its clear from the simply asinine limits, long standing ignored frustrations such as camp bugs, vending issues nw hackers etc that their primary sole concern is monetization and nothing more. The developers care but are enslaved to a system of excessive monetization.
---
Yes. Which was a confusing thing to use.....
---
lol no its nothing in particular except im just tired of getting shit on by bethesda
---
Agreed. The grind was already ridiculous. Now this. Make Fallout fun again please!
---
Definitely Fallout 76 HQ
---
I honestly thought it was going to be select what ammo you wanted then throw all your trash ammo in  nice and simple, wtf were they thinking
---
Cant take your words seriously since you pulled out that unoriginal and brainless complaint about the "1997 engine".
---
Yeah everyone at high level most likely would. I run that many these days I don't even care when I occasionally die and someone steals my flux from the queen.
---
Yes just for the fact you can roll quite a few chances at the piece of armour you need. Looking for a chest piece? 100% guarantee you get a chest piece rather than a chance of a limb at purveyor.
---
Space + e +enter + pinky finger on numpad enter. Enjoy te pain.
---
Without disagreeing with any of the points brought up here, I would like to point out though, that XP gained from finishing quests and events does seem to count for the "gain 10000 XP" -repeatable, so you don't just have to farm kills for it.
---
Whether that puts any real dent into any of this, I don't know, but at least that's some more XP, and a tiny bit more S.C.O.R.E. that we gain just by doing the events and quests that we'd be doing anyway.
---
There are weekly and daily changes that require you to scrap junk to produce materials. However, if you craft bulk scrap and scrap it, the materials gained from scrapping it count towards those challenges.
---
Wait till you try the ammo converter mate.
---
I took one yesterday and was able to fast travel for free and still have the same icons as before. A lot of people have said different though.
---
So you would rather not be rewarded for completing an event than to drop something that has uses, but you choose not to use?
---
The conversion rates are trash though, I'm only likely to ever use it to get rid of 40m, missiles and nukes.
---
yeah I remember building it once and never bothering with it ever again xD
---
How do you drop bullion into your stash???
---
I bet there’s more players who love it than hate it. Just on here the haters are louder and aren’t happy about anything. Who doesn’t love free stuff and yes it’s a grind but isn’t that what Fallouts about.
---
Which game?  
---
Because it aint this one
---
Y-E-S, Y.E.S., SEY, YeS, SeY, yes, sey
---
You have a bathroom? Here's me living in my log cabin and crapping in the outside bog. 
---
What luxuries you guys have.
---
It should be as bad as the numbers people are throwing around. Public events with (!) should be giving SCORE as well.
---
yeah thats true. 
---
i tried fast traveling to one without owning it and it said i couldn’t.
---
I spent 10 hours tonight doing them. I started at 5pm, finished at 5am with a few short breaks in there. Completed to rank 10 to get the Atoms. 10 hours to finish the dailies/weekly. That's not a grind I want to do each week all summer long. I can see myself uninstalling the game over this. It's not worth the time needed to do this.
---
As far as the rewards...I have the power armor skin I want, so don't need or even really want the cosmos one. The decor in this isn't to my taste, I don't have anything space themed in my camp. It's a clean vintage home theme (no bathroom so the clean sink is not something I'll use) I don't wear armor (stealth suit only) so those armor skins don't interest me, and their matching weapon skins don't either. I'm only doing it for the Atoms because now I'm forced to.
---
Breh 😂
---
can you link me to the stream?
---
Every game with a battle pass has some free tiers and bethesda could go down that same path were there's the items normal players unlock but fallout 1st players unlock extra items.
---
Sorry, my bad. I couldn't find his vendor.
---
Oh, now should I write : No, no, no, I am absolutely sure that you are the one.
---
Please DO NOT mention word PROMISE with FALLOUT 76 and BETHESDA, we know how things work there, still waiting for some of my promised features. ( TBH I support this game monthly - 1st, I bought wastelanders settlers and raiders pack, I do not want this game to die .)  
---
Dad, you need to get educated and see how the real word works NOW. :)
---
Suffering 'burn out' and that's understandable. Go play/enjoy another game for a bit and chill, that's what I do when I get pissy at FO:76.
---
Yes it does. The 0/5 challenges are awarding 1000 points at 3/5 then none at 5/5. It's a bug. I'm just completing to 5/5 anyway in case it makes something go wrong on refresh day.
---
I mean they could keep it free, they might just add other tiers for the fallout 1st players.
---
Not in this update. Pushed back to update 21.
---
Fuck this, why is everything Bethesda adds into their game just completely dogshit and an inferior system to other games with similar things, ridiculous.
---
That’s because legendary perks haven’t been added yet they were delayed along with the new collosal problem event. 
---
Only things added are public teams and seasons
---
Ahhh wow that is pretty cool thanks!
---
Oh thanks I thought they came out a while ago my bad
---
How do u get the converter?
---
Didn't they remove the need for water? I read that was going to happen at some point
---
They seem to be as buggy as the challenges themselves and not always reward score. The current challenges reward their score halfway through at 3/5 progression
---
Eh, i'll just grind atom from dailies and weeklies to skip the majority of the ru....wait
---
It's only worth anything if it's something you'd actually spend Atoms on if it was in the store. There's not one thing on the board that I'd spend any atoms on, not one. So since they removed atoms from the dailies/weeklies I have to participate in this or I get zero atoms now. Spent 10 hours going from rank 1 to rank 10. 10 hours to get 150 atoms. Not happy with this at all.
---
LOL~ See, you still can't admit that you can't stop yourself from picking up literally everything.
---
Let's say he paid 40$ for it, so he paid 8 cents per hour for entertainment. Looks like he got ripped off for sure, someone call the BBB....
---
/s in case it isn't obvious
---
Got the ammo converter yet. Surely someone could sue for RSI off things like that?
---
It's mad when one studio is making a whole game that can be played by blind people, while another is getting people to button mash repetitively where it is avoidable.
---
I started a legendary hi t when I nuked Whitespring. It filled up.
---
I didn't say it doesn't suck. I'm pointing out the stupidity of asking if anyone else is disappointed when there is literally dozens of threads.
---
Why cant the content be accessible for all instead of exclusive to those playing the game as a job? You'll ruin the game with that attitude, as is already happening.
---
Only if you use radex and radaway...
---
i didn’t get it for events, but i got it for CP in the form of the 100 for 10k a few times
---
Sod off! How dare you enjoy new content and post about it in r/fo76 Leave this sub right now and hang you head in shame.
---
Bloody come in this sub spouting positivity (spelt right - ffs saying that 'spelt' wrong now).
---
Oh fuck it - enjoy 😜
---
Just FYI of you decide to cancel (I don't how to live without my scrap box) you get to keep what you have in your scrap box, you just can't add to it.
---
This shitty menu has nothing to do with Fo1st
---
The quantity is not the problem the bad UI is the problem, you can't put a lot in because you would go cazy from the menu.
---
It’s not impossible to unlock. It’s super easy.
---
It was in one of the atom shops bundles when I got mine.
---
my problem is it needs running water and I’m currently parked on an acid node.
---
Is there outrage? The only real complaints I've seen were people somehow surprised that a free item that took about an hour, if that, to obtain isn't all that good. Oh, and about a shitty weapon skin but that one is understandable.
---
Oh my you'll actually have to play the game? But that's what I was doing anyways!
---
That's why we gotta bring the positive vibes in! :)
---
That's the only serum i don't have otherwise i would test it on an alt
---
I agree with you. Hence the "Clearly" at the start of my post. 
---
I never did understand why people feel the need to restate what has already been posted on the front page a hundred times in the last day.
---
Right?? :) I musta forgot it's not permitted in here... I'll skulk off now....
---
thank you the only thing that kept me on this game is the community just about everyone is super sweet
---
none of the other team based perks work solo in public group, so i’d be surprised if that one did as well.
---
the only thing i’ve been able to do solo in a public group is get credit for doing events
---
How can Building Team be better if you're only getting +4 INT max compared to +100% XP via Event Team? Am I missing something here?
---
Huh, is too. Thanks. :)
---
Upvoted as I respect everyone's take. Sorry my friend. Maybe next board it'll have some gear you like! Persevere :)
---
I’m not sure I don’t use a suppressor
---
That's not what I'm saying at all.
---
The guy I originally replied to was bleating on about people picking up stuff they didn't want, and then you mentioned people dropping stuff they had been given that they didn't want, and I merely mentioned that getting items given and then dropping them, was the same as not picking up things you didn't want, but with extra steps.
---
Which it is.
---
It was more a dig at the guy I replied to originally than a dig at you.
---
Yes thank you.
---
Why the hell would they give us points for bullets. I know it's a game and games aren't realistic, but the more unrealistic they make it the harder it becomes to suspend your disbelieve. It's like they are trying to make it more like one of those FTP mobile games.
---
I suspect you have to u lock the 10 power generator. One of my alts is right next to a creek but she can’t deploy the powered version
---
unless there was a datamine of the rank costs, we don’t know for sure yet that the math people did was right
---
Preaching to the choir. There must be some other reason they haven't done it yet. Surely it isn't that they *can't* do it, along with a basic trade window. 
---
Hell if they tendered the job to the community they would both be done in a matter of days, if not hours. There are plenty of awesome modders in the community who would jump at the chance to do it, and for free.
---
I missed yesterday’s daily challenges. Will I still be able to get to 100 if I miss no more, or will I have to grind for 10k xp a few times to get there?
---
You can unlock it once you reach S.C.O.R.E rank 5. Once unlocked, you'll find it in your C.A.M.P menu under "resources."
---
ugh i just completed 3 1000 score challenges and got nothing at all.
---
I know... I feel it too.
---
I can agree to that.
---
Well I’m loving. I like to do lots of events and usually it’s just me but last night it seemed like everyone was joining in every event. Makes it much more fun.
---
There is also a plethora of *Complete 76 Events [with X weapon / while wearing clothing etc.]* challenges, too, and I got one additional *Repair 76 [weapon type]*  challenge. I'm just hoping they'll cycle in more of those once I've finished all of them.
---
Kinda loving that they do these additions under the hood without boasting about them in the patch notes.
---
they also said this game works
---
Bethesda said from the Beginning that fallout 76 was going to be used to trial new features, seasons are the current way most online games are going so it makes sense for then to "jump on the band wagon"
---
didnt say no bugs. i said no issues. a ghoul inside a wall is a bug. but its not an issue. 
---
did the line in the sand event. ALL ghouls spawned in a massive blob right on top of the players at the SAM, rather than storming it from outside as they should. another bug, still not an issue.
---
spent a few hours just hopping around player vendors looking for deals too  
---
im not saying the game is perfect. far from even decent imo.. but in my experience so far, there has not really been any &gt;worsening&lt; of the game since update 20. its been pretty much business as usual, and actually impressed with how fluently the legendary run system has worked so far.  
---
the ammo converter was truly a legendary bummer.. its faster and more effecient to farm materials and just craft the ammo you want..  
---
rubberbanding is the same as always i think. its a serious problem which should have been adressed at the very latest with this patch. and im not using any perks regarding stims, so i dont know about that.  
---
the game is a mess. im not denying that.. all im saying is that in my EXPERIENCE it hasnt gotten worse with this update. obviously thats subjective :)
---
How many of them did you complete in a **group**? The event challenge specifies that.
---
thanks to the "do 5 of these" challenges bugging out and giving the score points at 3/5, scraping the first kit they gave me cleared the "gather building materials" challenge.
---
which was neat.
---
I am not sure about 1000, maybe that is the first time. I tried to check how much I got by doing the event. It might have been 100. And encryptid 100. But don't quote me on that. I need to check a few times more to see if that is so.
---
When doing Encryptid, I checked my rank (10) and current score (1100), and it seemed to have gone up to 1200 after event. But as said, I would like to check it a few more times just to be sure.
---

---
Yeah I plowed through all the solo stuff tonight and most of the weeks requirements. I cant wait to team up and get a stack more gear across this board.
---
About your damage output. You may want to try removing all your perk cards and putting them back. I also notice something was off on my side and my fixer went from 288 to 363 damage by doing that. I guess some cards was not applying properly after the update.
---
Wow, you got 500 hours out of it? I think that´s an amazing value, even if you paid the full original price, before the price dropped.   
---
I know it has many flaws, but it kept you going for 500 hours. I would say that's pretty decent. Maybe just take a brake from it and come back? Or do like i´m doing. A new character with a few rules. 34 hours and 15 levels into that play through now and i'm discovering so many things.   
---
* No fast travel (this is amazing, there are so many random spawns and events going on there. Also i´m enjoying my time much more, strategically deciding where to go next and what i want to accomplish. Also i´m just having fun going to supply missions. Walking all the way down to Charleston hospital to get my supplies and back to my base. Solid Hour of fun for me there.)  
---
* Read/listen to every terminal/holotape/note
---
* One star legendary's only and no Bloodied or Junkies (Trying not to get OP) 
---
* Im not chasing any META build. Just want to make a build i can have fun with, Going with full health Rifleman/Heavy guns hybrid 
---
* And only in private world (I know you need Fallout 1st but its not neccesary) 
---
Then whenever i just want to dick around, i can hop on my level 169 Bloodied Commando build with my legacy laser and feel OP.   
---
But these 34 hours and 15 levels have brought me more joy then the past 100 levels and 300 hours on my main.
---
I hate to see it. It feels/seems like it’s going the route of destiny.
---
They orobably did more events before that, or did Scorched Earth 5 times. The challenge says to complete 5 events in a group for 1000 SCORE points.
---
Well then I really hope there’s something that we haven’t noticed yet. 
---
Because this is not motivating in any way imo
---
May add under armour +2 and legendary gear. I run a full unyielding set, it puts it at 30 intelligence. Before food buffs or perk cards.
---
The generator version makes windmill noises whereas the decorative one does not. If they removed that noise from the generator I would probably try and run my camp on water power alone but as it is, it's far too annoying to consider.
---
So is it possible to get score just by getting XP? Or doing public events?
---
see the people are great thank you alot for the recommendation but im selling my acc today i hope you have a good day
---
Well why put effort into the game people buy FO1st anyways.
---
If you are on PC it's probably some hacked crap.  Sure sounds like it is based on your description of what it shoots.
---
That's a hacked weapon on PC. The hackers found a way to basically spawn in weapons with custom parts. They sell them on eBay for mega bucks.
---
Haven't got mine yet, but from the descriptions I've heard, you're spot on. Also sounds like it's best for lower-level players who really need a certain type but keep getting other stuff.
---
Oh well todd gave us another way to get to 100, buy it! It just works!
---
Yeah, that supply pack was basically a free rank for me. :D
---
Naivety? I disagree, and thats not very kind. We're talking about video games pal, no need for rudeness. Guess I was dumb for expecting any different on reddit. Oh well.
---
Of course it can be cool and not worth it (for some!) at the moment. The idea is cool, its great that its in there. Its just not as functional as it can be now, making its usefulness drop a lot for mainly the most dedicated folks. And yes, this issue can be remedied. Which is why the issue isnt hot-and-cold. Its a cool and good addition, it just isnt great right now functionally. But that can change, so its not something to get too bent out of shape about yet, since it released so recently. All we can do is give feedback, and wait. Complaining more than that is unnecessary.
---
Some stuff gets fixed quick, some take a long time, some are still not fixed. Its how it is. The folks ironing out this stuff arent made up of 200 people. Im sure they wish they could fix it all ASAP, but they cant of course. So they have to prioritize, and discuss what is worth the effort and what isnt. And what is even *possible* and what isnt.
---
Actually it genius.
---
See Bethesda didn't like people being sad about throwing away ammo.
---
So they make another option, one so awful and stupid that people will be happy to throw away their ammo so as to avoid such a dumb game mechanic.
---
Sixteen times the genius.
---
Could be from the XP challenge.
---
It’s not been there for me a couple of times... That’s when I head to DC island
---
the Nuka Cola helmet sold exclusively at gamestop had to be recalled to to a mold issue with the manufacturer. as far as i am aware, all helmets were sent back, had the foam linings on the inside replaced, and were disinfected. i myself bought one afterwards since they were super-discounted, and the inside smelled like cleaning chemicals (which i woll take over mold, personally).
---
the helmets included with the Power Armor edition of 76 had no such issues but asshats who will jump at any chance to trash the game "spread the warning" about the regular helmets without fact-checking, leading many to think the PA edition helmets also had mold. they do not.
---
Team Bush Wookie!
---
You don't have to have a full time job to get to rank 100. That's pure hyperbole. You're attitude makes it sound like you don't have much experience with online games.
---
Pandering too hard to casuals will drive away the hardcore audience (which often is your prime whale demographic), but pandering too hard to the hardcore players will drive away your casual players and make your game too niche. 
---
This trick is to find a balance. Most of the content of 76 is easily done by a casual player. Sometimes though, there's limited time content that rewards those that can put in more time and effort. You aren't automatically entitled to everything in an online game just because you bought it. So, yeah, sometimes you might also miss out on content you didn't have the time for or didn't put in the work for.
---
I'm not trying to say the new Seasons are perfect (it's far from it), but I don't think it's such a bad thing that you actually have to put in effort to get to the final rank.
---
Right, check [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hizp05/you\_can\_not\_afford\_to\_miss\_any\_score\_challenges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hizp05/you_can_not_afford_to_miss_any_score_challenges/)

There was a daily challenge, 100 atoms for 10,000 xp and it's repeatable. 
---
As long as this challenge reoccurs, you can get those 100 atoms. 
---
I think I did that maybe 3 times today but I wasn't playing aggressively not doing too many events.
---
Yeah, a hacked weapon
---
You get a little kick of score for every 10k exp.
---
In 3 hours of play I cleared 6 levels and thats because about 45 mins of that was converting all my spare ammo in the machine. 
---
Scrubs just want something to complain about
---
Pc yes.
---
Ahh. No wonder it was so good then. If Bethesda was able to fix anything ever that would be nice....
---
It does trigger even if alone on a public team. However people stating empathy works are wrong. Empath needs another Empath to gain benifits and doesn't work solo.
---
You get 100 score for every 10k exp. Events give EXP.
---
I wished Beth could do seasons better than rest of the industry, but at the moment it feels they were able to do them even worse. Such a shame, but thankfully the ammo machine is the only reward I want.
---
Changing dailys and weeklys to be the way to grind the season was not a good decision.
---
Per some comments, you also get score exp for public events,
---
it seems to be 250 per level of the event, _probably_ toping at 2000 for events like Scorched Earth, Encryptid and Radiation Rumble
---
Iw would be nice to have a decon show skin that's an actual shower
---
This'll be far less of an issue if the only events giving SCORE being encryptid and scorched earth ends up being a bug and not something that was intended and poorly communicated. I know I did at least 15 or so events today just because public groups make them a lot easier.
---
But then again with the weekly/dailies being event-related that might be the only reason people were so active with them. Who knows.
---
Why tf can't we attach it to a water purifier with pipes.
---
Better than nothing aptly describes this whole fucking game half the time.
---
Havnt noticed it yet, but I think its a deterent for the op greedys taking over like 6 shops and just resource running them for hours while players that aren't good at pvp can't take them
---
I posted about this last night and bethesda replied to say they'll fix it but to enjoy the rewards in the meantime.
---
I swear this is how it was at launch. Carnivore giving double benefit and none from plants and vice-versa. When i took a break and came back a few months after launch it was different. I like this better. Could be remembering wrong.
---
Thanks, if I'm still playing by then. I'm thinking about how much time this is going to take away from playing anything else. Doesn't look good.
---
Don't hold your breath lmao
---
We gotta a Nobel prize here
---
Not a bug. Your just misunderstanding the English. It only gives you 100 Score for getting 10k exp.  you get exp from pubic events.  Your digging into this way too much.  The answer is clear.  Xp gives u points. Challenges give you points. That’s it
---
Rank 39 will probs be where I stop
---
Honestly feel the same.  I was very excited for this and.. well after a couple hours I logged and ... really don't have any motivation to do it.
---
I haven't even gotten to the ammo converter, because doing public events doesn't award score like they said it would.  
---
I'm really mad that I convinced another friend to play yesterday.. now I'm like.. uhh sorry want me to cover the 20 you spent on this😕
---
If you are on PC, hit the ESC key to exit out of the terminal completely. Much better than the TAB key spamming.
---
At this point there is so much hacked stuff in circulation that some of the people using them don't even know it's not a legit weapon.  They may have found it in a vending machine or inside a suitcase and just think they hit the jackpot and found a really powerful weapon.
---
Like it hasn't already? These challenges are easier versions of the already easier versions of the same challenges we've been doing for over a year. If you played daily before these challenges aren't any more interesting than they were before. About the only plus is it feels like earning exp matters a little more.
---
They absolutely should do more to make the challenges and methods of obtaining SCORE more engaging. But that doesn't change the fact that the system is also designed to reward players that play more, which is pretty much what every decent online game tries to do. 76 could just use some more work to get it right.
---
Might wanna edit or delete this post since you know its misleading to leave as is
---
Havent got it yet, but bulk making ammo needs to be a thing as well so we dont flood the servers with repeated requests
---
I never bothered with doing daily and weekly challenges before cause i didn't really care for atoms. I like this system better and the blub blub blub sound from leveling blast me with dopamine... maybe i should try gambling... anyways, i know a lot of people will want the old way back. I know people who religiously went after daily and weekly atoms. I feel sorry for them cause they really are getting screwed out of what they wanted.
---
Ok I didn't notice that. As I said, I only did 3 events so I missed score being awarded. 
---
I thought I must've been missing something.
---
Nothing can be done the guns gone only way you can get that back now is if he or she returns it to you
---
No witch huntinf
---
Why does everyone bitch about "they are only in it for the money"? OF COURSE THEY ARE. The problem is that they would have a better fan base if they kept doing more new content and fixed bugs instead of dreaming up new grinds with dubious pay-offs. I played pretty much every day for 18 months, enjoying the good bits and gritting my teeth at the bad. I took a break two weeks ago to wait for the new patch. I came back and it looks like ASSHOLES (and there are way too many in this game) can still kill the queen in 20 seconds with magic weapons, wreck your base with explosive bait, steal things through the un-fixed vendor glitch, dupe using 3rd party programs, etc. No surprise, the ammo machine is a drag by all accounts. 
---
When is the next patch?
---
I am sorry. I deleted their name
---
Yeah but the previous challenges gave atoms and you could choose what you wanted to spend those atoms on.
---
The challenges should've been used as extra XP and you should be able to gain XP from doing Public events etc.
---
Hmmm so I´m already behind. Guess i just skip it then, no need to invest the time and get disappointed anyways.
---
Agreed. This happens on a lot of the enemies I come across. Really annoys me.
---
Public Event award SCORE too. I made it to rank 10 on my first night.
---
No fucking way, dude he legit messaged me the other day asking if I had any decent Handmade's he wanted my quad explosive but I declined.
---
 then today I get another message saying he knows how to dupe but it requires 2 people and he's trying to help me lmfao I shut that down real quick.
---
Can't Bethesda just send my profile back a few days like the victims of the inventory steal?
---
I was thinking about this principle:
---
Worth = amount x resources * 0.66
---
But problem is that different types of ammo require different resources, so that won't work to match the ammo one to one one way or the other
---
Maybe just restart the console/PC and try again. Should still be there, if not on your wheel then in the atom shop. Mine is.
---
I was a victim of it. I fell victim to it since I was tired of getting bad luck and wanted something I could trade for something really good.
---
I agree with you on the concept of “slowing down”. I feel the same way.  Right now I use unarmed. Which is always one hit.  So I just hope others tag as I’m running up on enemy. If I get there before your bullets then idk what to say...unarmed is hard as hell to dial down in the first place. 
---
Game needs to be harder. More hordes in events.  I want to die more often  I’ve spent too many hours on this game to not play with my god tier equipment
---
the public teams should have a PvP type, just like the "roleplayers" and "builders" types. if in a public PvP team, then an attack on one is an attack on all.
---
also bonus XP from killing players.
---
Still need to verify that myself, but there are comments about this, so there have to be some truth to it
---
anyone who expects a corporation to be interested in anything but their income is a fool. they want to please us just enough to keep us going. duh. that's how businesses work. it's like being mad at a fish for swimming. it's what they do, man.
---
Looks pretty solid. Point distribution looks good.
---
I’d consider:
---
swapping Tank Killer for Glow Sight.
---
Use a dense torso, and swap in rejuvenated for Fireproof and Revenant
---
You say that like you've been grinding the same dailies for SCORE rank over the last two weeks. Seasons literally came out yesterday, and it's way too early to make those kinds of remarks. 
---
Then again, some prople live to whine...
---
You get 1000 per 10k xp, plus 500 per level up.  Average level up is about 15k xp (at level 100), so that is approximately a 650 score average per level-up.  With the xp buff changes to carnivore and herbivore, level ups come much easier.  For me, approximately 30 super mutant kills will give me 100 score, plus a bonus 500 at 300 kills.  I can live with that, even if no other challenges existed I could make level 100 easily this season.
---
No. They 100% will not do that
---
Sounds like they want you to spend some real money buying the rest of it then
---
Shoot. Well, thanks for telling me
---
Would be great if I could put a recon scoop on my handmade though 🤔
---
Having to actively mess with things constantly, rather than having the process occur passively? We've never had this conversation before... (perk cards)
---
regarding your edit: I already had 2 weekly challenges of 1000 pts a piece not award the score. FML
---
Yeah exactly, if they were doing it for the pleasure of the people buying their stuff, they would have both given it to them and given them exactly what they wanted.
---
Even just casually doing a farming run can get you more EXP in the same time you spend doing (most) single events.  I see the appeal of event hopping, but in general each event is 10-15 mins, the 100% only applies to the final exp reward (I think), not any of the enemies you are fighting throughout, plus you will probably have 5-10mins between events.  It probably depends on how much time you're playing for, but if you're spending the day doing events, crafting, killing every on sight, the +4 INT bonus to EVERYTHING you do will add up over time.  It really depends on what you plan to do with your game session and for how long.
---
I didnt see any front page. Im fairly new to this forum thing as it is, and im of advance years and not very savvy with forums etc.  Sorry for reaching out.
---
Yeh 25% is a better number than 10
---
I had no costs yesterday doesn't matter which scenario my workshop had.
---
Whether you did it from the map or pip boy, it's still not for doing 5 daily events it's for doing 5 daily challenges.
---
You're really missing the point about the Ammo Converter. No one was expecting it to be this OP thing, especially since the conversion rates were datamined before the patch. I'll point out again that the problem is how horrible the UI is. It should not be such a chore to convert your ammo. They could make the returns on ammo 10x what they are now and I bet you the majority of players would still avoid using it because of how awful the UI is. Fix the UI and you have a semi-useful item. It'd supplement high level players in between crafting ammo and may be very useful to the low-mid level player struggling to find their specific ammo type early on.
---
I honestly don't even know what your point is for the rest of your argument. I never said make anything easier. My point was that global Atoms are finite and many challenges are not worth the effort for the reward. Once the easier challenges run out, sure you might have enough for a few bundles, but that's it. Now you're limited to 1, maybe 2 bundles every 3 months. 
---
It sounds like you think it's a good thing that players stop being able to earn things they want. If anything, being able to earn more of the things they wanted kept more players around than if they were strictly limited to a very small number of items of their choice. If Bethesda wants players to spend more Atoms so they'll be more driven to buy more Atoms they should work on adding more AND better items to the shop.
---
Give in 40 i say and will sandman ur weapon hits hard
---
I don't have any bloodied fixers but I do have a two shot fixer +50 limb damage, Two shot explosive handmade and a two shot 25ffr if you want any of those?
---
Are you aware you can expand the section of the wheel you want to use to see alternatives?
---
and in different colors! Nuka Cola colored Ghillie Items!
---
That's exactly it. They're not our friends that are here to listen to our every beckoned call, they're a company and that means that they'll make decisions that sometimes we don't agree with. I'm the same as you though, I tend to just play and enjoy the good, deal with the bad. Just blows my mind how many posts there are, all complaining about every little thing. This post was intended as a "please shut up about it". 😅
---
You don't have to give me those. I will just get it back through the rng system or Bethesda doing something. Both sound have a really low chance of working.
---
Yeah there's two ways yo do business though. DO fuck all and milk cash cows who just throw their wallet at anything OR create good content and foster a large player base through good will who will want to support the game. Unfortunately most companies seem to take the easy rote these days, you can guess what BGS is doing.
---
Laserbeam splitter on a handmade lol
---
Thanks for the reply
---
 On pc, I just restarted, checked, nothing. Not even under emotes in the atomic shop. Everything else is there but the raider salute. I was using it until yesterday. Im so confused. Should I try contact besthesda.net  support ?
---
I’d rather sell the ammo I have and get the caps and buy the ammo I need.
---
I also have had to pay for fast travel to my workshop. My workshop ocons had changed too. 
---
I hope it is a bug.
---
Yes. I noticed it because the Q)expand option was greyed out on my hot wheel. Went to check the shop and I only have the default wave and then I bought the fly boy salute today.
---
In that case ya, about all you can do. Hopefully they get back to you in a timely manor
---
The conversion rates are trash and the UI is insulting.
---
Of course it's possible to spam click your way thru the whole ordeal but we shouldn't have to brute force this thing just because the devs made it in the most tedious way possible.
---
Could have worked like a vendor.
---
Could have allowed us to set a quantity slider.
---
Heck, could have been like the bloody workbenches from New Vegas.
---
What we got instead is yet another thing that seems extremely half assed.
---
That kinda goes both ways..
---
Z team
---
Thank you  for the incredibly kind offer though.
---
my icons keep changing back and forth it’s super weird
---
Hahaha! This is so funny. Donyou realy think bethesda will do such thing? Its your own fault and lesson learned i think.
---
Well, shit! I guess it’s a bug. 🤷‍♂️
---
Support duping, and you deserve to lose your shit.
---
I know.
---
Oh boy that's nice.I always craft it for double xp and had 10 left.
---
Let alone I know easily get around with +200% melee damage ahah
---
Yeah well sorry to tell you but that's sadly not how it works. There probably isn't even any bgs employee reading this. 
---
The best you can try is contacting their support directly but they rarely do things like this and if they do reset inventorys, it's most likely because someone fell victim to a glitch.
---
Never give your weapons to anyone who claims to dupe them or stuff, that's just... well... Stupid. And when trading always use a courier.
---
the items lose their value. its really cool when i see an item in a camp that was only available one year ago. it shows me that the player is an og, and was there when said collection was released.
---
I got to 7 doing all the daily and weekly except for completing the rank up 3 times.
---
Poison damage to a bloodied build is the worst.
---
Alright. Thank you for the advice. I hope you have a good day sir/ma'am.
---
The crazy thing is the Ammo Press at the The Pitt expansion in FO3 had a much simpler system so how hard can it be to just not mess this up!!!
---
Yes, 5 events and you get SCORE. After that you get bugger all for the rest of the week. 
---
This is only "super easy" if you are willing to put atoms towards purchasing ranks in 2 weeks.
---
Understood and thanks very much!
---
They are trying to get the optimum return on their investment, this doesn’t involve developing the “best” most engrossing game. The game has to be good enough to keep you coming back but not so good that you are camped out on their server infrastructure for days on end. It’s a fine balance. 
---
If they produced the best game in the world they would have to spend a fortune on infrastructure to support it. You “finish” the game and leave &amp; they are left with all of the Server capacity. Moreover, the hardware they have invested in becomes legacy &amp; depreciates in value at an alarming rate. 
---
From a business perspective there is a ratio for the optimal number of users online for an optimal level of infrastructure investment that will result in optimal fiscal returns. Bethesda uses arbitrary limits, repetitive tasks and seasonal events to manipulate player behaviour to achieve this ratio.
---
We want the best game they can give us but that does not make business sense to them.
---
You also get Atom shop deal every day that other's don't see
---
Well, more than likely they did it differently than the people just going through the menus like you're supposed to. If you do it the way it seems Bethesda wants us too you'd have to click on like 6 different menus just to sell one stack (stack range from like 3 to 100 depending on ammo type). However, if you spam sell/buy and you Tab back on the terminal to the ammo type you were just buying/selling it reduces the time exponentially. Without that it would take a really long time to get through that 10k and I'm assuming most folks didn't bother to try and figure out that little trick tbh (not that I blame them)
---
&gt;regularly by gaining XP, AND by completing Public Events. 
---
No I think you're misunderstanding. If they meant that public events give you SCORE through the xp you earn there is no need to list it after saying "by gaining xp". If what you say is the case, why not include other xp generating activities? (Dailies, Repeatables, Crafting, Killing Enemies, etc etc etc.) Specifically mentioning public events and omitting all other xp generating events suggests the public events should specifically reward SCORE. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong about what you're getting at the moment, I just think public events are intended to award SCORE and aren't at the moment.
---
loosen*
---
I am down 100% as long as events start giving an adequate amount of SCORE (100 at least). Until then I can’t get behind this impossible grind that requires atoms to complete:
---
And you bought it right?
---
Yes. Definitely. I've been actively using it until today.
---
Your math is wrong. Level 1 is free. Your total score is off by a little over 3k
---
You're welcome but like I said the support rarely does that if no bug is involved. You can still try if you're lucky, maybe they help you out.
---
I onced got scammed to by someone in our group. A full et of Vanguard Sentinel Forest Scout and a Je Handmade. He got kicked from our group in no time.
---
Daily challenges are what atom daily challenges used to be. 
---
Open map then press right on d-pad.
---
I just know there were bugs where the Uncle Sam salute was available to people who didn’t purchase and they just patched it out. Wasn’t sure if raider was affected.
---
Levelling up has always been a daily challenge. At least now it's straightforward.
---
What’s at level 39?
---
I agree. Plenty of room for improvement but some of these comments are a complete overreaction
---
Sadly by now with their complete turn towards greed I doubt they would ever put in as it doesn't generate them money in the short run and they demonstrate with each patch how their focus only relies on short income not long-term sadly. Atleast on PC the text chat mod shows us what could be if Bethesda would give a care.
---
It is his own fault but that is no reason do be such a dick. He just said he's going trough a tough time and you laugh about him? What kind of sick person are you?
---
The dailies are pretty easy, like building doors at a camp, but I noticed that normal events started giving more treasury notes.
---
Hmmm..  now you're kind of making me second guess myself..  I wish there was a receipt system for atom store items so I could check but.. I'm sure I bought it.
---
well excuse me for existing and excuse me for not being as conversant with this forum thing as many other obviously are.... Excuse my lack of perfection.  first of all,. you dont know me or my circumstances.  Im old, over 50 so if that makes me stupid, fine.  Second, if I find the format of this reddit thingy confusing and complicated, sorry,.. I guess that makes me even more stupid.  Third... I had literally just finished an hour session of the game having literally just downloaded the update, so yeah... at 9 oclock at night, im really gonna think and take the time to say to myself... OH WAIT.. I better somehow try to see if anyone else asking the same quiestion before I reach out to other people for their opinions... HOW LITTLE did I know that this place was full of judgemental perfectionists..... SO Im Stupid... WHO KNEW!?
---
cheers for the info
---
Why did you play a game for 500 hours that you don’t enjoy? Shouldn’t you have quit a long time ago? Lol
---
Has anybody tested if they also actually fixed the forced-PvP if you were in a group thing yet?
---
It’s absolutely not impossible to unlock all of the tiers..
---
What is your actual complaint? Your post is about raising awareness but you didnt explain a single thing.
---
I like the challenges that award score before they are even completed.  Also breaking my adrenaline perk was a nice touch.  I have more time to reflect on my day too, thanks to the increased loading times.  And the ammo converter UI is almost too slick for me to handle.  
---
To top it all off now we have multiple public teams doing radiation rumble.  My team and all the other teams can sit and watch me be the only one to collect ore the entire time!!
---
The problem with the daily’s and weekly’s are that they are time gated. When you finish them you’re done for that time period until they reset. According to some users on here who’ve done the math you’d have to log on every day throughout the season to rank up well and even then you’d still need some atoms to get to 100. That’s 10 weeks straight of grinding everyday without skipping and still not being at 100.
---
So you did get score for those events? That’s good to hear at least
---
because i kept on making friends
---
Is the BOS questioned in yet? The new one
---
I have never *ever* found shovels in the building next to the cemetery. Is that the building you mean?
---
&gt; would put up with this tedium.
---
its an RPG .. By definition its a timesink. If you got rid of all the 'tedium' there would be nothing left.
---
It kinda is, there is a post about it with about 400 upvotes with all the math that goes into it. I posted the link in another comment in this post.
---
There aren’t even 8 daily challenges available...
---
2 of those complaints arent even game related. Find better teama to play with, literally all the teams I played with were supportive and used voice chat. The load time thing doesnt happen to me so I cant agree with that as well. I wouldnt complain about the SCORE glitch that is literally a benefit.
---
&gt;How many of them did you complete in a group? The event challenge specifies that.
---
not really relevant, but i finished that challenge that requires __any__ event in general
---
https://ibb.co/XWLykHt
---
the FAQ states we will get points from exp (100 per 10000xp repeatable) and get score from __public__ events, which i have yet to see awarded, and we dont have a repeatable __public event__ challenge
---
If you feel like you can’t miss out on those points for level ups and seriously find it too challenging to grind a little bit each day, then make a new character and level them up just once a day. Once that character starts to get too difficult to level up, delete it and make a new one.
---
I have no idea how the challenge works, I played for 4 hours today and didn’t rank up once with the challenge.
---
IMO, this shows that the Bethesda peeps do not actually "play" this game. Trading 100 5mm ammo at a time, with multiple button presses for each exchange, is crazy. Takes 10 minutes to exchange a few thousand ammo. Way too many menu selections and the numbers offered to exchange are unreasonable. It's silly and clearly shows me none of the devs play the game regularly.
---
You can't sell them unfortunately.
---
Can I repost this? I want this to be seen.
---
If you ONLY do daily and weekly challenges you are about 5k short. However, that ignores the other ways to earn score (xp and public events). Note: public events seem to be bugged but people are reporting getting score from scorched earth and encrypted. Either way, no it’s definitely not impossible.
---
You can't trade or drop them.
---
There might be small score bonuses that have not been stated. Like completing the rotating events or killing a legendary. This would account of those increases. 
---
I definitely was getting score when I had not competed any challenges or completed 10k experience so it’s possible.
---
Thanks for that...
---
Nerfed in emergency hotfix in 3...2...1
---
People will post anything for Reddit karma.
---
Can you pass along that the ammo converter is "certainly not ideal..." aswell? I hate when insignificant stuff like this gets an immediate response but real issues are just ignored.
---
I grind and get about 2 to 3 levels a day with my level 425+ toon. (Thanks global pandemic) I feel good about completing it with time to spare.
---
You still get atoms from 1 of the daily challenges, except its not mentioned as a reward.
---
You claimed it on the score board? 
---
If so it may just not be listed in the “skins” section which would be unfortunate.
---
Could be counted as "retired post". There's a list in the sub details somewhere.
---
It's supposed to be hard to get to rank 100.
---
I did 3 different weekly objectives and I’ve gotten nothing
---
The sheepsquatch camp item
---
him and half the world...
---
No offense intended there bud, also an old git over here. 
---
It's just that when you're on here all the time and see the same thing over and over it gets a little old. That's all it is. Our bark is worse than our bite usually. 
---
Happy gaming mate.
---
It’s not that bad on console. Click convert, back, convert, back, etc. You can convert thousands of ammo in a couple minutes. It definitely could be improved but i wouldn’t call it a nightmare.
---
The base game isn't free my guy. Cost of entry is 40$. Used to even cost 60 bucks at launch. Don't even start trying to defend the monetization practices of Bethesda.
---
40$ for the game + insanely priced mobile based cosmetic shop + one of the more expensive monthly subscriptions out there while being really low in actual value.
---
Bethesda is just a poor small company right? Cry me a river please. There are games out there with x10 the quality and polish of this game that even push out updates for free.
---
I'm 100% for monetization that keeps a live service game going, but this ain't it chief.
---
My pc never had hickups. Min fos is 90 to 144max (screen refresh rate) and on ultra.
---
You could see if you have any footage of the item and contact Bethesda one way or another. Like uploading a video of the item, explaining w/e in some sort of support ticket and leaving that in their hands to see how they respond. Beats me man.  
---
I heard of people trying to send similar stuff when the vendors were bugging out and effecting stashes.
---
Yes you’re brotherhood transmission is in
---
I finally get to try out some different agility perks now with my spare 5 points from adrenaline.  Also have no idea which weekly challenges I still have left to do since they randomly complete way before they are actually done. 
---
 Saw all the ammo converter posts yesterday and figured it couldn't be that bad until I unlocked and used it this morning.  The arbitrary categories for ammo types is just baffling.  Why not just list them all on the same screen like the Armco machine does?  Or add some more categories like ballistic (extra medium), energy (medium but not overly medium).  Seems like that would be even more intuitive.
---
Just let events give score and I’ll be happy. That is literally all I want out of this game; something to grind without being at the mercy of timegates.
---
Same here. Really annoying when you grind out that weekly in a day and dont get the 1000 points for it.
---
Alright, Well if you ever decide to come back, i think you'll get to experience it again all brand new. Building up a new account. If you ever do so, you can hit me up and ill give you a starter package (:   
---
Ps. Love your name, think i saw that in a camp while back
---
Why is that so? The best battlepass I know is the one in MW. It has great additions and is super easy to master. It just adds a new progression into the game.
---
Everything that adds frustration into a game is not fun. And a battlepass like this feels designed to make people pay for it.
---
You are talking about the 5/5 gold star challenge thing? It’s literally just completing 5 of the 6 other daily challenges on the challenge list. You can do all of the adventure ones (level up, etc) and ignore the one NW one.
---
IF score is awarded for public events as intended then the cyrrent system shouldn't be an issue. Bear in mind the whole premise is that it's relatively difficult to complete.
---
Of course the base game isn't free lmao
---
someone pointed this out yesterday. I think it's almost guaranteed that, instead of fixing the gauss shotgun specifically, properly, they just reduced the damage of all charge weapon by half in vats.
---
I don't have any video footage sadly. I did send something to support and I hope it gets answered. I deserve it though for wanting to be a part of duping.
---
&gt;But then again some people like to be optimistic.
---
You say that like it's a negative thing. Nobody's forcing FO76 down your throat, you play it out of your own free will. If you do something every day out of your own free will, but doesn't give you joy then you should stop doing it. 
---
Some people complain about the challenges being too easy and others complain that they won't get all the challenges done to complete the season. 
---
You just can't please everyone, and game devs know this. Honestly, I'm not shocked that it seems like they stopped trying. People always find something new to complain about.
---
RadShield gives you more rad resist than RadX, and it doesnt suppress mutations.
---
At first I didn't understand what the big deal was. Using the terminal screen for ammo conversion isn't quick and modern, but the clunky old school interface really adds to the flavor of a Fallout game.
---
After seeing how convoluted the conversion process is though, now I get it. Holy hell!
---
Good to know, just seemed like there were inconsistencies, as I completed the build up a camp weekly and received no score so unsure.
---
Are you out of fusion cores?
---
Yes.  Once again.  People complain about everything.  But to say they're not listening is just ignorant.  They've absolutely made adjustments based on feedback and complaints.
---
It really is getting tougher to not see this as Bethesda trying to push more Atom sales through stuff like this.
---
When I went and did my own napkin math, the *only* way to mitigate the grind to 100 is by earning experience. That 100 SCORE per 10k xp does add up after a while, however, it only really reduces the overall time you spend grinding dailies + weeklies by about a week or so when you've gained 30 levels worth of xp.
---
It doesn't sound bad on paper, but when you stop and realize that gaining 10k xp per 100 SCORE isn't exactly quick. Unless you're super hardcore about level grinding, it'll be slow going for most people.
---
Yes. I was level 6 within a hour as they  awared without doing most of them
---
the converter item itself doesn't look that bad tbh but it seems Bethesda just has more skilled designers and artists than actual game developers.
---
Imagine needing to play the game a shit ton to get rewards... making those late items super rare...
---
Ranked up 6 spots already. Still love this game. Downvote me.
---
Sort of unfair it’s nice but people can just pay for it I wish it was sorta later in the legendary run thing
---
If you are too low level to get starched genes I wouldn’t worry about mutations honestly. Take rad-x and radaway with pride. 
---
Also what type of armor are you wearing?
---
They aren't ignored. We just don't have anything to share at this time. As I'm sure you're aware, there are many posts on this topic, and all are being forwarded - not only what we reply to.
---
I made it to lvl8 and I played all evening. I did most of the daily and most of the weekly challenges.
---
And people still defend them no matter how increasingly bad and greedy they get.
---
I've genuinely seen 52 of them since yesterday. Like, holy shit, it's a low level reward in an a  big update that completely overhauls the social menu, adds more to the main menu, makes a Battle Pass which is complicated as shit dev wise, adds loot boxes basically, adds a whole new teams feature, updates the menu UI, adds more to the separate main menu on the map and fixes a bunch of bugs. Like this update was mainly UI changes, but as a game dev, people don't seem to understand UI changes, in my experience, are complicated as shit and take ages to do, so no wonder they had no time to focus on a LEVEL 5 reward that is genuinely a tiny feature.
---
Same here. I’m done with the weeklies and dailies as well. 
---
I was hoping that we wouldn’t have to wait like this to keep grinding. 
---
But I guess that’s how they control how much we achieve
---
There are certain questions that are asked several tines a day, and have been asked several times a day since time immemorial.
---
These are in a section over on the sidebar to stop this sub from being nothing more than the same questions over and over and over.
---
this is the exact fuckery i was worried about.
---
also, I noticed that the board was separated into 3 "chapters." do we know if SCORE requirements change at those points? i have a really bad feeling that there is a steep jump going from one chapter to the other.
---
why the fuck to they have to zap everything with some kind of mediocrity ray gun? why do they hate their players?
---
Yeah, I claimed it. It's listed in the apparel menu but the option to favourite it for NW just isn't there like other outfits.
---
Uhh that’s understandable!
---
No. The SBQ gives 1000 score all by itself
---
I don't have a list prepared but off the top of my head the water wheel now produces electricity which it did not originally.
---
Actually I like seasons in general -- it's much better than just "have sone atoms" for the daily grind.  Makes it a little more interesting.  But.. this reward.  Just pulls the plug on the interest.
---
Bullet-fone is just Kramer.
---
Take your time, its not like everything is going away over night...you have plenty of time to unlock everything.
---
You on PC? My teammate is always complaining he's out of plasma cores. I use em too. I could probably sltrade something mundane like a couple hundred diluted stimpacks or make you a set of x01 or something.
---
No one said you have to do everything for Max score just play the game if it happens it happens, if you wanna look at the dailys and say hey I can do that while exploring my favorite place,dope, it's just reasons to play the game again!
---
Gaining XP is what I do in this game.
---
Nice, nice lol The last pre-teen I stumbled into ended up referring to me as their "game mom" to another player we met, bc Im a 30-ish chick who tries to help newbies. It gets weird out there in appalachia
---
Queen, awol. Encrypted. I got to level 8 last night
---
that's my concern - what does this say about the rest of the rewards?  I think the seasons concept is good, but they can't drop the ball on rewards.
---
I also think the rewards should be /items/ more than plans.  I want to be able to sell and trade these things.  The rarity will make them interesting.  If I can just craft an infinite number of them, not interesting (i.e. treasure hunter outfit -- I wish they hadn't given plans on it).
---
Well that is unfortunate. Hopefully a bug, the skins aren’t that great imo for normal adventure gameplay.
---
Force lock was an option in the older games, dissapeared when fo4 came out. Gave a success percent based on your SPECIAL and skills.
---
Because Bethesda, only they shall know the mysteries of the wastlelands.
---
I don't even have the ammo converter yet, but I've been honestly tempted to open a thread about it anyway, just to get some of the current wave of karma.
---
I'm 5/6 T65, just missing the head. I feel like my rads were better in the x01 set but I was so new then I dont recall.
---
Call the perk "percussive technician"
---
Legend. Thanks.
---
I'm okay with this.  It's good to have a high goal that is hard to achieve.  So what if everybody can't get it with an easy grind?  If everything was easy, it'd be boring.
---
I turned 2000 .38 rounds into 500 .50 call rounds. It would have taken me the same amount of time to take over a workshop, defend it, and harvest enough lead and steel to make it myself. Plus, I'd have the xp.
---
Why do you think Bethesda gives a damn about those with such a problem, my RSI loves the keyboard spamming while smelting ore, my fingers hurt just thinking about it.
---
Sliders would help big time for large quantity, less screens/buttons presses would also be nice, maybe instead of using the terminal we use the machine next to it and put all of whatever ammo we want to scrap in the top, run the machine, ammo scrap comes out the bottom! Not too hard I don't think
---
As far as I know they’re an actual mod for individual pieces of wood armour? So you need to apply them when modifying armour pieces at a workbench. You can’t do this in NW.
---
Do you wear a helmet? IIRC that’s where most of the rad resist comes in. I don’t know the t65 stats but x-01 should give decent rad protection.
---
No one asked for freebies from Bethesda. I'm just curious why you think the way they monetize the game is of benefit to you as the consumer?
---
I'm just saying, they ask for so much but the quality they deliver is really low and sub-par.
---
I'm not here to shit on Bethesda for no reason and i play and enjoy the game as well, but some things must be said.
---
Not trying to be mean to you or bash you or whatever. Do you really think that how they are gouging you for money while delivering really low quality on all aspects of the game is okay to you?
---
No more workshops for me, no loss I guess?
---
you can reach that in one sitting of a few hours.
---
I did the whole set of task in a couple of hours and now I am very close to 11th rank. Try to play in public teams. Actually it is a lot of fun. And I dont give a fuck that someone told "it is not possible". It is. Some tasks are repeatble. Today u have to make 10000 exp to gain another 100 points. For example: "Line in the Sand" almost gets u there. Sometimes it is kinda bugged and all scorched respawn at the same place the whole event. Who knows what is gonna be next time. So man up, no tears and go have some fun. good luck.
---
I believe Bethesda rewarded those who had already purchased the underarmor with Resistance protection. I kept mine as a backup and modded a newly created one.
---
People were saying yesterday public events weren’t giving any score. Ugh. I didn’t bother with any. I’ll have to try again later.
---
Does the jetpack come with the chest or is it a modification?
---
Someone said Scorched Earth gives 1k? I guess I'll have to go do these myself and figure it out.
---
It's a modification, so you need to buy the chest and then the jet pack plan.
---
Lies
---
No, you can favourite armour and weapon skins through the Atomic Shop menu and it applies that skin to the item in NW.
---
They said the most they would do is maybe give a couple additional unique awards to 1st players. Doesn’t sound like an entire tier. They haven’t even made a decision on that yet
---
Yeah my original was randomly modded but couldn’t understand why, i just thought it was bugging
---
Ok thank you. How much gold bullion for the jetpach?
---
Yeah I have X01 head. With diluted radx my rads in the nuke zone is 1.5 or 1.6 hard to tell but the consistent rad depletion of my hp kills me more then I'd like. Get distracted and fall over dead.
---
I just know that while I was focused on those I was randomly achieving score. Mostly when completing an event or killing a random legendary. I don’t know how many times I hit the repeatable 10k XP but I doubt I’ve hit it at all.
---
Are you sure you didn't just get the 1k prematurely from the kill robots weekly challenge? 
---
I've had that bug as well on multiple weekly challenges.
---
It was meant to and was a bug. Bug fixes are not player requests.
---
They are supposed to according to the FAQ on their website. Seems to be a lot of confusion though and reports saying yes and no. I haven’t tested myself but my understanding is yes public events are supposed to give score.
---
Every challenge alone wouldn't give you enough score to get to 100 you need xp also
---
Am I correct is saying the S.C.O.R.E.-board is account wide? If so, why not start a new character just for the level up challenges? 
---
Might not be ideal, but no more missing out!(:
---
I've considered installing that mod that swaps the broken toilet and bathtub models for a clean toilet and shower, but I feel like if I ever take a screenshot with them visible I'm gonna have a bunch of people asking me how I got them.
---
Start a second character just for the leveling up challeneges. It counts for your entire account. Much easier to level a new character than one thatsnover 300
---
Wouldn't they use AWS or Azure for the servers?  But I see your point.  They are only damaging their reputation by releasing these things half baked at best. 
---
I completely understand the need for consistent revenue.  They aren't a charity at the end of the day.  But even so that's up to them to get the revenue model right.  I pay for FO1 and found it is worth it.  
---
I felt like a king with the scrap box and tent.  It eliminates the need for grindy mechanics and annoyances.  But after getting towards the end of wastelanders and seeing another currency.  I'm still subject to that grind even though I'm paying for a premium service.  
---
I really think they should have done a paid and free battle pass track.  Earn your atoms back also.  They would find more people would buy from the store.  Plus it gives a revenue stream to support the game.  Thing is if this game made millions more, that money probably wouldnt see reinvestment back into 76.  I don't know.  I love the game, but these issues are disheartening.
---
IIRC it's 2000 for the jetpack and 1250 for the chest.
---
Thanks for ruining it for everyone.
---
Wouldn’t an armour mod be different to a skin though? And as they aren’t an atom shop item, how do you favourite them for use in NW?
---
Public events definitely were not giving score yesterday
---
The fact that I can't get Ultracite ammo from it killed it for me. Dead in the water.
---
It is crazy isn’t it? Hitting 100 isn’t something everyone should be able to do. It should be an achievement. The system seems balanced to me, even if I hate the idea of seasons.
---
well yeah, value for them!
---
Eat a fuck load of Cranberry Cobbler and meat stew while drinking Cranberry Juice and Nuka Cranberry.
---
I converted a few thousand 10mm in a couple minutes last night. Just how much ammo are you converting????
---
I really hope that isn't the case....
---
I seriously expected it to have a daily limit on ammunition points. I feel that the converter perfectly embodies Bethesda's potential as a game developer. Really good and positive idea, but executed poorly without thought or testing and really low quality overall.
---
Maybe the fixed it overnight? People are definitely reporting getting score now.
---
Thanks. This is what I was reading and wasn't sure of the accuracy.
---
Good to know. :T
---
No it doesnt I done scorched earth 3 times yesterday no score
---
Happy to help!
---
&gt; This thing is WAY over-engineered. 
---
Made me laugh, it is indeed so typically Bethesda and over-engineered 😂
---
I'm really not sure about scorched earth. Sometimes it feels like it's been giving 100 or so others maybe none. Going to have to test it.
---
It was meant to?  Proof?
---
Thanks for the info there mate, though to be honest I don't know if I can be arsed to grind NW without the double XP event on.
---
I've done the SBQ 3 times and I have gotten 1000 points every time. If that's working as intended it's nowhere near as bad as expected really, it's still a grind blah blah but it can offset a lot of the daily grind or whatever if you are willing to do it a lot whilsy doing your normal thing. 
---
Not sure of other events honestly, I believe I got it for doing project paradise but I can't be 100 percent certain as that event last night was the busiest I've ever seen it and it was chaos, same with line in the sand, I placed my tent in the glitch spot and it was just a mssively fun clusterfuck of players using explosives and grenade launhers with bodies flying everywhere. 
---
SBQ is the only one I'm certain on but I assume they all do.
---
Just a question, how is that max score calculated?, did you take in acount teams (building teams are awesome because higher INT=more exp), lunchboxes and other buff's?
---
Me too, I'm busy later but I'll try and run an Encryptid and scorched earth tonight and see for myself.
---
Is it hard to make?
---
Which is the point of the game..
---
Never expect malice where incompetence is the simpler answer. Ergo Bethesda Developers don't know how Math works on creation engine.
---
I have to go check this out cool
---
Hopefully
---
You can absolutely get to level 100, beyond the math being wrong on many of those posts (they all seem to ignore the fact you start on level 1 for free), they also ignore the other ways to get score (xp and public events). 
---
Disclaimer: lots of mixed reports about whether public events are correctly awarding score or not. According to FAQ on Bethesda website they are supposed to.
---
I haven't used it yet so you are probably right, another wasted feature..
---
In theory, if the 10th reward is 150 atoms, then a F2P player could but their final 10 levels, and only need to grind the first 90 anyways
---
Unfortunately mine did last night, so either people aren't seeing it proc in the chaos, or it's bugged randomly for certain people.
---
You've been triple quantumed!!!
---
Lucky boi.
---
Yeah, I got it already. Actually, it was weird, I got a lot of score out of nowhere... maybe it's bugged (surprise).
---
Let me know how you go!
---
1000 per scorched earth isn’t bad at all. Definitely cuts on the grind a lot. The season is 10 weeks, a lot of people are upset they can’t bang it out in a couple days.
---
I'm convinced that the Ammo Converter is Bethesda's way of showing us that grinding to craft ammo isn't so bad after all...
---
I did radiation rumble this morning and did not get anything.  I did scorched Earth afterwards and got 1000 score. 
---
The problem is that with the challenges giving points before they are even completed I can't really tell if it just ticked one of those off by doing scorched Earth or if the event actually awarded me points.
---
every time the game's present and future start to look positive, it is like they intentionally try to fuck it up. it's like they *want* to be hated and never taken seriously.
---
I think the bigger factor for them is making a single one-size-fits-all interface that services both PC &amp; console players.
---
As a result its the PC players who have a mouse &amp; keyboard that suffer.  Trying to figure out where your weight is coming from in your inventory is maddening, there are mods that can help alleviate it but it's lipstick on a pig.
---
Sooo what is the proper math to take into consideration? I mean.. I guess I'll still be grinding the same quests and events.
---
I am making my Ally wear a straight jacket &gt;.&gt; my poor ally has no free will. It's even trapped in a room xD I'm so mean.
---
Without knowing the exact amount of score available I  publoc events it's hard to tell. A 1k increase I would have noticed
---
Yes because we ALL have time to log in every single day
---
I’ve seen these figures quoted in a few threads now but leveling and XP Seems to be ignored. factor in those especially with well rested and all the other XP buffs and it then do the math.
---
It might not be as bad as it looks.
---
Still a grind but if you are doing that anyway it’s not going to be impossible.
---
Don’t forget to look at the positives . I’ve never seen billingsly have 12 helpers before or 18 turn up to the SBQ
---
Perfect response😁 why covert ammo with such a bad ratio anyway? I use all ammo types,(apart from syringer and cryo) just swap weapons and pass ammo to your other characters like give. 50cal to your heavy gunner and if you don't have other characters then create them. You will discover new play styles and experience more variety.
---
How did you do this in a couple minutes when it takes 10-30 at a time? I probably have 20000 rounds of junk ammo, so 1000 times through the menu I suspect.
---
I don't know why we can do 100 at a time or 1000 at a time.
---
jetpack is very underwhelming. I'm going back to biocommesh for the 50% extra chem duration. 
---
Definitely want buttressed though
---
Lol yea, that sounds about accurate.
---
Still waiting for you to name one.
---
I'm still earning Atoms at the normal rate, the new extra thing is annoying but it unlocked the Clean Sink from the Atom Shop. So if they made it to where you unlock less Atoms from grinding, but grinding give you a chance to unlock random Atom Items. I mean it's like a really weird decision. Like they hired someone who worked at a Casino to consult on the game.
---
It's not an armour mod, it's a skin. A picture of owned skins appears in the Atom Shop menu with all your other owned skins and you can press a button (triangle on PS4) to favourite it for NW. My problem is the skin is in the menu but the option to favourite it is missing unlike other skins.
---
Whatever, as long as it gets looser.
---
I've been super critical about the ammo converter, but that's just one part of the whole.  In general, I'm really pleased with the seasons rollout as it gives me something to do besides grind for a weapon that I'm probably never going to get.  
---
I understand that people are upset about the loss of free Atoms, but frankly I never really cared about that.  To a certain degree, it encourages people to group up run public events, which I think is a step in the right direction.  It's not a perfect system, but I'm willing to see how the season goes before passing judgement.
---
Not new been like that since wastekanders
---
Wish they would of set it so we can drop bulk ammo into the machine similar to how we can sell bulk water to a vendor then just give us the ammo points at what ever cap they dream up and let us buy ammo in bulk from the converter machines also... As it is this machine is not worth the budget it takes in my camp.
---
I think 1000 score per event would be a bit much personally. Considering you would need a total of 230,000 score to get to level 100 roughly you would only need to farm public events 230 times
---
Its looks like data mined future content, if i remember correctly its just a skin for the handmade, not a new weapon.
---
good bot
---
Depends on your build.  I'm a sneaky sniper so the +3 agility and +3 perception of shielded raider is better, for me, then the bonus on the SS underarmor.
---
Have you played this game at all?
---
I found the same.. XP from kills / craft and especially event completion with the Team play multipliers tends to rack up fairly fast.
---
Was wondering why I get a reward yesterday in NW lol. Do you know if I get both Christmas and halloween items at 250 XP for example?
---
It's pretty cool honestly. I like most people was worried that once the daily/weekly was up that was it and it would make it extremely boring/difficult to complete for the vast majority of people, when the only repeatable took some time an only gave 100.  I held my coments though to see more info for myself etc before moaning about it with no info. 
---
I don't know if the even reward is repeatable in short order though, I solo nuked earlier and got the 1000 but I haven't tried doing it more than once to see if you keep getting it... It's still a huge grind really, just more bearable. 
---
I'm mid way through rank 10 and if you had the patience to run endless public stuff and it WAS repeatable I suspect there'll still be people who hardcore farm it and get it done in a week. Time will tell.
---
honestly, there isn't any big deal; it's just a carrot hanging in front of our noses to get us logging in everyday.
---
Total score needed is 220,275. If you do all daily and weekly challenges you should get 215,000. That leaves 5,275 score to get from xp and public events. Some people are reporting scorched earth gives 1000 score. That makes the season super achievable IMO
---
You overestimate xp gains by a lot, 100k exp for only 1000 score xp is not ok.
---
yeah, i don't know how far hardcore players are yet, but i noticed the board is segmented into 3 "chapters." Im really concerned that each chapter will come with a substantial bump in required SCORE per rank
---
The stuff of legend.
---
I mean it's a new patch/system in this game, I'd be massively surprised if it wasn't bugged somehow rather than people missing it. I do know that I got the reward fine last night myself so who knows.
---
Thanks! Good to know.
---
You don’t need to go through the entire menu. All you need to do is select the ammo, convert, hit back, convert again, etc. It’s just alternating buttons back and forth.
---
Thanks for that I'll go and look at it.
---
well that's the thing with Bethesda and Fo76, many of their concepts are good in general but severely lack in execution as their CEOs still push to press every cent out of each feature and if it doesn't deliver money in loads in the short term it gets shelved immediately. They're trying to build a Ferrari out of the cheapest car parts on the general market and expect it to work.
---
So, it's achievable if I start today? That's what I want to know.
---
I agree with you it's not a big deal, but the number of posts acting like it is is crazy.  And I can't blame a company for trying to get people to use their product everyday.
---
At least they're not slidey bois.
---
I was just playing normally for a little bit last night but did not level up. So I switched over to a level 5 alt character and knocked out the first few story missions for a much faster level up. Gotta get the settler vault raid done some day so I might as well level this character when I need that daily done quick and easy. Couldn't afford to miss the 500 score since who knows how close it might be at the end.
---
Let’s revisit this in 6 weeks
---
Remind me 6 weeks
---
I got a double a few days ago but idk how to post the pic
---
OK Understand, better go and look at it.
---
It is always a pleasure to find a shiny and refreshing quantum, let alone three!!
---
I'm worried they might end up revoking them later tbh, but better safe than sorry IG. I'm up to the halloween combat rifle paint and the christmas hunting rifle paint. Dunno how it works as far as me getting them at uneven times tho.
---
I like the way it is. I like the fact that not everybody is going to be able to complete it. The daily players have the best chance of completing it while the weekend Warriors probably wont be able to without spending atoms.
---
Seems fair the way it is.
---
Happened (or rather not happened) to me too. It just doesn't let you activate it in the AS, don't know why.
---
Is the [Feedback Form](http://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10?prod=1129&amp;cat=287&amp;session=L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTkzNjA1NzM0L2dlbi8xNTkzNjA1NzM0L3NpZC9mVXprTDZBRzlHZklXTFNBMlFwSnBydFdMWVRkVm5uWVl1em1Yenp5eXFvMHZHa2lybU42M2tDODlOVFlHYkY5X1Y4MHJQNEphQWZXMjdXY0cycU1USVpQSW43YTZSR0JoNzByemRubXlJVFBycGxxMEk3ejhOZVElMjElMjE%3D) a better way to get this kind of information to the team? Or are 100 posts complaining about the same thing honestly more likely to be heard?
---
right :) ..it's just business. you either find your fun, and play along with them, or not.
---
Or it might reset in some way, we don’t know.
---
I have a long weekend coming up with lots of rain keeping me from doing outdoor stuff. I’m hoping to get a couple of ranks by maxing out my xp gains
---
Sweet only need to kill the queen 220 times? Me and the guys I play with run a ton of queens so this will be pretty easy.
---
I already know i won't be able to grind it all out.  I already know the 2 items i really want, both are below 40th... and one, ironically enough, is the ammo converter.   Even if it sits in a corner unused.
---
Nothing about smelting in the wiki.
---
I did it yesterday and didn't get anything.  I did complete the robot challenge during it and got SCORE from that.
---
I honestly think that the devs were directed to make an ammo converter machine that was unexploitable . It’s unexploitable alright, it’s unusable as well unfortunately!
---
I tried. It was a mistake to share this. The savages refuse to listen.
---
I searched for a new quest and I've not found it yet.  So far, just the 2 new radio signals.
---
Someone was saying they got a large amount for Encryptid as well, so let's hope that's the case as it will make getting the required score a doddle. I've yet to run scorched earth since last night but that is great to hear.
---
You’d reach that before then, very likely, since so many other things award points.
---
Had the same happen when I completed a the weekly challenge for camp build. Didn't get the 1000 at all. I even left the team and reloaded on a new map and still no SCORE points.
---
Is there a daily limit of ammo?
---
This sounds like a great suggestion, not too powerful but functional
---
Of course. For me, the SS fits my build perfectly, and the endurance buff was just the icing on the cake.
---
Yes. And you have 2.5 hours to get daily challenges from yesterday. Either way it’s achievable.
---
That would actually be very helpful, and I'd very much appreciate it!
---
Yes, it does, confirmed
---
I used it on .38, .44, 10mm and fusion cell ammo.  Nobody will ever buy those anyway, so why not.
---
I wish I could log everyday.  Must be nice
---
Why assume everyone just wants to get xp faster though? Got my perks where I want them, couldnt care less about levelling any more. Would actually rather stay lower level if anything, run INT at 5 for the crafting perks and that is it
---
Yeah that's still a lot of bat killing though, 3 or more a day if that's all you did to get score. If it works as an addition to the dailies and weekly challenges that's fantastic.
---
It gave me a headache
---
i wanted to turn it into a explores towers with maps,posters and curtains all down the inside wall but its just to small cant fit a stair case inside without it being mega cramped
---
It's already on AngryTurtle's youtube, so chill down bro. I believe this is intended as well, they said they wanted to give more benefits to eating/drinking, and remove the penalty for not doing it. Exp buffs are also less problematic when they give us an excuse to farm levels further through Legendary Perks
---
We know
---
Given that you can "interact" with the non-terminal part of it, I 'm wondering if the intention was for it to work like the legendaries. Except that they couldn't get it to work, and the terminal was the only way they could figure it out.
---
Keep wait.  I did.  You've offered zero proof that I was wrong.  Good try though, bud!
---
My guass rifle felt horribly underpowered yesterday. I was wondering what happened.  Is there any documentation from Bethesda on this to explain the nerfing?  I'm kinda sad now.
---
If you re on ps4 go to settings, system storage, images and then you can copy the images on a USB pen
---
i doubt they’ll revoke them, it’s quite an effort to go back and see who earned it just now vs who had it.
---
Doesn't seem to be one but the points cap at 3000 so they need spent before more are added at that point and the ammo has stack sizes so you can't throw in a single missile for example, you need to have 3 of them.
---
Honestly I am looking forward to seeing others complete quickly so people can stop complaining how unachievable the seasons are. 
---
I’m not a fan of the seasons. But like to contain my criticism to the format vs execution. They are totally achievable and I should be able to get a good chunk of not all of the rewards.
---
Depends if that's all public events or just scorched earth.
---
Do u just lvl up?
---
Yes you do. You earn for both pools of loot as you go.
---
It's still dumb that there's pretty much no way to finish the pass without paying atoms. Every other game with a battle pass will let you finish it by grinding but you HAVE to do every daily to not have to use atoms.
---
Yes. I sound like a dick. But come on. 10000 posts on this Reddit alone. Common sense is still a thing right? If i tell you to transfer me 1000 euro/dollar or whatever currency you use where u are and tell you ill make 2000 of it. Will you send me the money then? Sorry for him having a bad time. But think twice before you make such trades/giveaways
---
That’s the whole problem. There’s no challenge in it. It’s a chore that you log in every single day to complete.
---
Yeah I dunno I see it as you're getting atom store items you just don't get to pick what you're earning. That being said, a lot of this stuff are things I'd be buying. Nobody even mentioned the nifty little sink at like RANK 3.... Each to their own but I'm really happy and just wanted to see the positives in it.
---
Right so my point stands
---
I think I will take my fat man and use a mini nuke (or 2) on the scorchbeast Queen.
---
Well I'm pretty sure I didn't get any for tea time, project paradise or radiation rumble last night.
---
One of the community managers acknowledged the mistake yesterday and said to go ahead and enjoy the free prizes while they look into the issue. So it is definitely unintended, but they’re letting you go ahead and keep what you earn
---
Are you running any mods?  Try disabling them and testing again. 
---
Often after an update, mods can cause interference with the game.
---
Both avenues are looked at fervently, and both are valid. We are watching and listening, but in the case of the ammo converter people are reporting most, we just don't have anything to share at this moment.
---
Like I said, I know it's his fault, event though its no reason to be mean to him.
---
So you can't. As there is none.
---
Not really. Giving 5 unique skins to fo1st (maybe) isn’t the same as a separate tier.
---
Depends if you already have good max lvl armor with at least 2 legendary effects you want its not worth it. But if you dont have anything good playing with rng wont hurt you
---
They're unlocked by getting the corresponding amount of experience
---
You can see how much each item needs in the Limited Time Rewards section of this page:
---
You are not describing someone who wishes to complete the Battle Pass though
---
I hope they don’t patch out soon. I want that sweet beanie and fur lined jacket from the Xmas rewards but I’m going away for the holiday weekend aaahhh
---
It is do-able without spending a single atom, but you will need to bag almost every challenge to do so, plus with the repeatable XP bonus SCORE you can influence how quickly you progress based on xp earned (time playing).
---
Shan’t be doing this then tbh. I work 9 hours a day already I’m not coming home to a second job. I play games for fun, and it’s rapidly becoming obvious that fun isn’t what Fallout 76 wants to provide.
---
Inspirational gives you 5, 10, and 15% bonus xp for being alone, as the only member on your team.
---
Yeah pretty much the same. I don't fully agree with the implementation etc but it is what it is for now, and it's still far too early to judge whether you will get increased rewards as we go along for instance or a rotating event reward or anything really.
---
Definitely. I like the converter and its better than dumping it all in a bag. If I was to point out a negative is that;
---
A. It's goddam huge in my compact bunker camp...
---
B. The colour scheme... Gross....
---
I thought the car mirror on the back of the ammo machine was the worst thing about camp builds... But I'm literally renovating my workshop so my ammo converter can even move inside. It didn't need a separate terminal.... But I'm still pumped for it.
---
Ok just needs more clarity as the original information from bethesda said public events give score which would suggest all of them. That's why I said 1k per public event would be too much
---
Not only it is bad, it bugs out when using it in power armour
---
I think iirc SCORE is currently not to be rewarded for events but they plan to for future seasons, I could very well be wrong though but I seem to remember reading that somewhere
---
The point of the game is to collect what you need.
---
Not literally everything no matter what
---
Very nice thanks for the info!
---
But that's just you making up numbers from a statement that only validates the idea of extra stuff for people that pay extra.
---
 That's a pretty cool bug! Thanks for this maybe l'll grind nuclear winter before they fix it
---
It won't even tickle her and will just cause lag for everyone FYI. She basically ignores explosive damage and fat man barely do anything to normal enemy's. But if you're just wanting to burn some mini nukes for shits and grins go for it
---
Funny you say that, I jsut updated my main post saying I got 0 for Guided Meditation, but I was just about to kick off Encryptid to check that.
---
I agree with that, I'd be done in a week or two if that were the case. We need some clarification then, for sure.
---
Sucks, just another oversight I guess. Probably have to wait a while to see if it gets fixed. I was psyched to use the skins as well. More than most other things on the scoreboard.
---
Dead in which way? I always find a lobby of 40-50’people within a short amount of time
---
there’s still 150 every 10 tiers with score
---
Shouldn't be a surprise they screwed players again.
---
There's stuff at the end that I want.
---
Explosives. There was a post where someone knocked some stuff loose a few days ago.
---
\*Laughs in Todd "It Just Works" Howard*
---
I wasn’t getting the 15% credit while alone, I also wasn’t getting the bonus movement speed from squad maneuvers while solo on a private world. I’ll retest it again later tonight to verify. I also wasn’t seeing an increase in damage from not getting the bonus from Lone Wanderer
---
I’m literally only posting this so this ongoing trend of “ammo converter hate” reaches some level of attention to the developers at Bethesda. To be honest, you probably could have figured that out for yourself pal. The complaint is obvious, and does not need further explanation as we all know the ammo converter is hot carnage (I thought that was common knowledge). Also, if you even read the “I just want to see enough posts” part of my comment, there would be no need for this discussion to happen.
---
That's my plan too lmao, I completely missed the Xmas and Halloween events so I'm pretty damn happy
---
Brilliant, let us know how you get on with that then. I didn't get any for tea time, project paradise or radiation rumble last night.
---
The one I did last night gave me flux and armor.
---
Checked my stats and saw it was there. Otherwise wouldn’t have kept using it.
---
Already did.  Your ignorance is showing.
---
Yep, fuck Bethesda.
---
All good. I play melee, so the ammo converter isn't even on my list of things to care about tbh. I meant more for giving feedback and suggestions in general, and wasn't sure if the feedback form had been more or less made redundant by Reddit.
---
Despite the complaining ad nauseum, I'm very pleased with this update anyway.
---
Submit a support ticket for sure, but I got SCORE early for several challenges - the Bot one for example. So I got SCORE randomly early, but never got it upon completion, so keep in mind that may have happened.
---
Mgmt doesn’t play the game
---
Really? must be a regional thing. I am in Australia but before the update it took so long it was rarely worth it
---
I'm not even hoping to make it to 50 lol
---
We all would. Unless there are different amounts per public events with scorched earth offering the most
---
According to the faq they're planning on other ways aside from challenges, xp and events after season one.
---
&gt;A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
Yea when I melt myself into a goo pile right after the queen is dead and lose the fluxes, that’s really fun XD.  They are cool to play with from time to time but very easy to commit assisted suicide for most situations lol. I’ll let you know when I want to trade them away, I’m on PS4 too.
---
Odd how people spend weeks and months complaining about finishing everything and the end game has nothing to do.
---
Then they're given something to do, but it's too easy cuz they're so high level.
---
Then they're given something else and they complain it's a chore and they have to bust their ass to possibly achieve it.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It start fast but will be getting slower and slower with time
---
Bethesda, I'm not mad, I'm disappointed, you need to start applying yourself.
---
I thought my damage was a little lackluster...
---
Ah right i must have read it wrong
---
I would give my character's left hand for the Fireplace Door
---
Since I can't do that, grinding it is
---
My workshop ft is fine! Ps4 though. But yeah no issues.
---
I’m on daemoni side here, I pre ordered the game and was banned instantly without being able to log in once, I emailed them called their support and they said they would fix it and nothing for six months. I ended up making a new account and still wasn’t able to play, I had to buy a whole new console and to play the game because of their staffs incompetence
---
I’m just going off of official press releases. They said there will not be a paid tier. So this is my interpretation of that. If you have more info that points to a more fleshed our premium tier system I would love to see it. Please share the link.
---
It's only 100 SCORE for 10k xp. Getting 3000 SCORE plus would mean 300k xp or around 20 levels.
---
Yeah it's possible I got smaller amounts from what I ran last night and didn't notice I suppose. I would have noticed if I got 1k though.
---
It kinda makes sense that the harder events would award more.
---
As i use heavy weapons i need a shit ton of junk to craft ammo.. i need a crap ton of ammo.
---
Glad to hear it! 
---
Yeah feel free to share your feedback here, there, or anywhere you know we can see it - tagging or messaging us works too.
---
&gt;But you're also getting a bunch of other free stuff you would have had to spend atoms on
---
90% of free items there are pure trash tho
---
Spent a good hour spamming A last night 
---
Wouldn’t recommend
---
Hey there,  
---
This is all part of preparation for the BOS coming. I don´t want to spoil to much. But if you want there is a lot of information here in Juice Head video.

Ahhh ok, I get it and will try that tonight, thanks, I didn’t hit the D pad, my fault
---
Well you took down the post so good job on spreading awareness. 👌🤦‍♂️
---
I scrapped some camp stuff so i could have some budget to place this down and it was a major disappointment!!!!! Way too hard and confusing to use.
---
Absolute joke...they need to sort it out asap
---
Scorched Earth does not reward points and was instead getting confused with delayed point gain from weeklies. Public Events ARE supposed to give points but do not right now due to a bug.
---
Yeah I am ignoring NW, I haven’t done any investment there and don’t want to start.  Thanks
---
A quick trip over to the Fallout Wiki explained that interacting with the dirt mound made a shovel appear next to a tree... So... I just used the internet... to search and find an answer to a question I had ... in game... It's tough out there for people without shovels... I guess...
---
Go to my account and read the post.
---
Supposedly pre patch 20 gauss weapons were doing max damage in vats without having to charge them. Now to get that same damage you need to charge it each time before you go into vats. I don't have one myself to test but that it what was supposed to happen.
---
Ya I’ve been doing it for a while now and haven’t gotten it to drop
---
I’m pretty disappointed, I really don’t wanna have to complete a bunch of boring repetitive challenges every day if I want to get certain items, I’d rather just get more from actually doing what I WANT to do in the game.
---

---
It's good to know if I go on a week long vacation during the summer I loose out on god knows how many ranks, thanks bgs.
---
I had mine award the score early and then nothing on completion. This was for the robot one - it triggered at 4/5.
---
I just did a test on a private world (PS4).
---
Charred Ghoul without Inspirational (on luck team) = 117 xp
---
Charred Ghoul with Inspirational (on luck team) = 117 xp. 
---
If inspirational was working I should have received 134 xp
---
This appears to be connected to the last point you made about them lacking icons. The team will be taking a look. Thanks for sharing.
---
As by far the biggest core gameplay system, inventory management is abysmal. One time I accidentally removed my "batteries included" perk card. I barely had any inventory and was still encumbered. Talk about losing your mind. Turns out my plasma cores, plasma cartridges and pa cores were super heavy. There was no quick way for me to see "Hey idiot! This stuff is really heavy!"

 &gt; This appears to be connected to the last point you made about them lacking icons. The team will be taking a look. Thanks for sharing.
---
HONESTLY would not care if I had to wait a day for it to convert my fucking ammo if I could just toss it all in and forget about it
---
There is an intermittent issue - on PC at first my main was logged in to do all the challenges, and they worked fine, FT was permitted / free, normal icons.  When i logged off to transfer some items to an alt, the alt logged into the same server and was no longer able to FT to any he claimed and they had the "new" location icons instead of the workshop icon.  I would get "cannot FT to a workshop" when unowned and have to pay when owned unless i was going to a defend event.  This leads me to believe its not the server instance but somehow the characters, but more testing needed.
---
Ok it's because I'm in pc and I was using the mouse. I rarely ever touch the arrow keys or enter key, which are needed here. Thanks!
---
There are a lot of mixed reports. Either way, definitely seems like they are supposed to.
---
Not really. Just need squirrel bits. The rest of the components are easy to get.
---
Thank you for doing the math! Knowing how hard it is to obtain rank 100 lets me know that I'll now have more time to level up in Path of Exile because I'm not grinding out this hot garbage mess of a dumpster fire. What morons on the test server said this was a good idea? It's good to know I can now walk away from this game for a few months because there's literally nothing to do in it now except the boring daily routine that you get in every online game. Time to play something else. It's easy to see they are just pushing us to buy atoms, fuck that, can Reddit tear them a new one like we did for EA?
---
Nope, nothing for Encyptid, so thus far my own experience is that you can't complete and get the rewards one after the other. Time frame is another matter,  maybe it's one a day or something?
---
Now all I need to do is run a silo again and see if the SBQ is repeatable like that in a short time.
---
Easier to comply to US law if you don't have a text chat.  [http://igda-gasig.org/what-and-why/about-cvaa/](http://igda-gasig.org/what-and-why/about-cvaa/)  You might have seen this trend since late 2018 in gaming. Thanks Obama.
---
Sounds like a few rounds of NW is worth it. You dont have to PVP.  Treat it as a game of hide-n-seek. Ive finished in the top 5 many times just hiding.
---
You must have finished some sort of challenge, I never got Score for anything other than challenges.
---
Also it's absurd to say that in order to enjoy the latest rewards you must grind, many don't have either the time to spend, or money to throw, thus it was much better earlier, you were playing 1 hour per day, if you were lucky, and got some atoms, no matter how little the amount you were gathering the atoms, and in the you were able to buy the thing you wanted, now you get what the devs think you deserve instead.
---
For instance I care not about any of these rewards as I already lost the chance to get a ton of others, but this reward system is to accomplish 2 things: 1 raise the online with the children that will grind(and other people with a ton of time), so they could show the statistics of the online sessions to the bosses and saying the game is doing great, and 2 appease the so called "Whales" that will spend any money available if given the right impulse.
---
About your "showing off" your achievements, well in the game there is a sh*tload of other means to show off: create a museum with the rarest loot in the game, unique items, hard to get equipment(that will most likely never be obtained by casually playing) and so on, also the things you'll get by grinding the score will be nothing special by the time you'll get them, as the ones willing to pay will show them way earlier and if you won't pay to unlock, many others will unlock the things at about the same time as well so you'll be nothing special. 
---
Though if you want to show off to the newbies, then this is even more stupid imho.
---
Now get scrubbing that toilet!
---
Seriously though we need a clean bath and toilet. Maybe a shower
---
The ammo converter would great if you could do more than the pitiful amount they have listed.  They should have put in an option for the amount of ammo you want to convert, similar to how you choose how now for other items.
---
Yes I too ran the numbers. You need to hit your daily and weekly challenges. Missing one puts a very steep grind on you for xp to get the repeatable.
---
Assuming you hit all dailies WITHOUT nuclear winter one, you need to hit the repeat 4 times a day to stay on track. This was done by me in a casual 3 hour session which included focusing the dailies. So its possible without N.W. at least. I'm currently on track, skipping out on the N.W. challenge but it was such an easy one, I kind of regret it. because to get 2 repeats would have taken much longer and it gives 2.5x the repeat.
---
So we'll see if i can get there. I'm rank 5 and We can only pray none of these become true to keep our progress on track:
---
* The rank xp curves higher at some point (terrifying tbh)
---
* The daily/weekly numbers are not consistent and lower (yikes) or get higher (praised be)
---
Thanks for the prompt reply! Since it started happening right after the latest patch and it isn't something I'd experienced before I didn't know if it was A Thing™ now.
---
you cant use any AS armor skins in NW right now for some reason.  my camo paints (from the set) were already equipped prior to the patch,  i un-equipped one and the option to equip it vanished.
---
__if you have an armor skin equipped, dont un-equip it or you will not be able to put it back on__
---
Yeah that’s the sad truth. 
---
But again a company needs money to survive. I just wish it wasn’t this transparent lol
---
ah okay, i thought they always give 5%. thanks for the info
---
No problem, good luck! You definitely should be able to fly through with keyboard (well maybe not fly through, but go a lot faster!)
---
Holy cow! I run away from D2 for the insane,endless and pointless grind.
---
This subreddit  and other Fallout 76 communites are at fault. This is inline with all other updates and mechanics Bethesda has introduced in the past 2 years. It's time to stop accepting these underhand practices that psychologically encourage you to s-pend money.
---
Casinos used to do the same shit until society wisened up and banned many practices casinos and other gambling establishments used to encourage exploitative game play cycles.
---
You don't like hitting enter over and over and over again up to what is it 4-5 times to make a single transaction? I love it...
---
Nope, stairs are connected directly to the cabin's doorway and there's no way to move them.
---
I actually had to pay to join a Defend event as well.
---
FWIW I was on a private world, dunno if that makes it more or less likely to be a server issue.
---
This
---
Public events should be awarding SCORE though so bit of a moot point. 
---
There are mixed reports of it actually happening though.
---
The NW challenge last night was use stimpacks.  It took me all of 3 minutes to go into a game and find 3 stimpacks, take a bit of fall damage and get my score.   Even if you don't like NW there really isn't any reason not to do the challenges..
---
I hate building.  I think it's boring as hell.  My girlfriend builds all my camps for me.  I didn't want to do the build weekly challenge last night.  But I hoofed my ass over to a workshop and took a few minutes to build up all the crap to get my score.  
---
Even though I don't like building, I still took a few minutes to do the challenge.  I was no worse off for it and everything was ok.  Sometimes it's ok to take a few minutes to do something we don't particularly enjoy for some rewards.
---
Okay good to know on that at least. Did you launch the nuke last time yourself or just join in on someone else's? 
---
Does anyone know if you need to do the silo yourself to get the score, or just complete the event? And do you need to be in a public team as well. 
---
That would be good to know. I hate being stuck at work not able to test stuff myself.
---
It was just the shotgun, the rifle and pistol was fine.
---
At that price Todd should come to my house and act like a doormat
---
Dont forget the 5 dollar generator skin
---
i noticed no change on a solo public team when equipping inspirational, only one i tried.
---
Thanks for the math! I dislike PvP as well...but I very much like eradicating the super mutie race on the regular anyway. So this helps! 😬😬😬
---
It's not bugged. You're not understanding correctly and jumping to conclusions. It's "Complete a Daily Challenge 5/5".  You have to complete 5 "Daily Challenges", not daily events.  I had the same issue but when I completed all Challenges it went to 5/5
---
How is it broken?
---
I heard that they just changed where to get Sophia’s first item since you can’t go inside anymore.
---
It's not even that much of a grind. I got four or five levels yesterday just doing my usual run claiming all the eastern workshops and hitting events for treasury notes. At this rate I'm more annoyed that there's going to be a month at the end of the season where there won't be any new daily rewards.
---
What's the atom cost per level?
---
Didnt see anything on the roadmap thing about buying a level
---
Does the perk card show up in effects?
---
This worked really well...thanks for the tip.
---
I actually completed Project Paradise successfully for the first time event thanks to the public team stuff.
---
I did the silo solo yeah so I have no idea. I am pretty uch always in a public team now because of the strange in numbers benefits as well as the x4 XP for events perk. 
---
There's a lot of variables but I'm thinking the most likely one, to prevent people just farming the entire thing in a week if they have the patience, is a one a day cap on the 1000 from an event. 
---
I guess I'll go launch another nuke and tick something else off the list :D
---
Same here. And also 2 times.
---
I actually thought it worked like the raider one but only more slowly. That would have been neat. I could even live with a terminal if we just had to use it ONCE.
---
Rarely
---
It's slippy out! Yeah!
---
The robot and building supply ones give you your score after you complete 3 even though it says 5. You probably already got it and just didn’t notice.
---
That’s still not a reason to pick up ammo you are t needing. I mean seriously.
---
Damn most have been a bad server or something thx dude
---
I think XP has become more important to a lot of people thanks to Seasons and the repeatable challenge points you get for 10000 XP.
---
The quests arent there yet. This is in preperation for them arriving. They are reaching out. The encrypted one is also from the BOS. You can aslo see some changes at Atlas observatory. You can find more information in this Juice Head video about it but it contains spoilers.

---
It's this 100%.
---
there is already a maxi transaction with fallout1st isn t that enough? 
---
 They removed atoms from dailies and week and the season will be almost impossible to complete without paying atoms for the last lvls if you dont spend atleast 5h a day on the game.
---
No atoms from dailies and weeklies and i m sure we can expect the best items in the atomic shop on the first few weeks while there is still players coming back for update to maximize the amount of people paying for their atomic items. Then atomic shop will be back to borring for sure.
---
tbh i m not sure what to think about this, if it s greediness or if they will just pay better their employees
---
Yeah I think you might be right, but I guess time will tell. I might get time for a silo run tonight, but I doubt I'll have time to test two back to back.
---
PRIDE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
---
What about fallout 1st? 
---
What about settler and raider bundles?
---
They have many ways of making money for little in return. The season pass is just another way for them to try and drain peoples wallets (mostly parents of spoilt kids)
---
Except the weekly challenges reset.  I also leveled about at least 5 times. Idr exactly, but running a public building  team with inspirational spend things up considerably. In top of actually playing the game.
---
handle checks out..
---
Same. I love how some players can make the most hideous things into something quite comical lol
---
Uranium Fever just popped up so I'm gonna tick that off too I guess whilst I'm here.
---
Ahh gotcha. May have reduced gauss damage across the board then when they fixed the shotgun.
---
Its because like another poster has mentioned on here they just don't play the game there developing for .. they have no idea and its pathetic considering they want to make money from it.. sort it out Bethesda!
---
We’ll see. I just don’t believe there’s really anything good left to release. It’ll just be skins, wallpapers, and stuffed animals moving forward. I don’t think there will be any more potential must buy items. And for this season, the only good things are unlocks not atomic shop purchases.
---
The perk just isn't working. No damage increase over 30 seconds.
---
The stein at the end. ONLY REASON
---
I'd rather run westek twice. Easily.
---
I think there was an exploit a while back so Bdaddy removed it.
---
The best thing to do is not stress over it.  I made it to 3 in the first day without even trying and will continue to do my personal grind plus any events that come up.  Stop bitching about it and play the game or go play Fortnite or whatever.
---
Same problem with spawning in Ash Heap (The Rusty Pick).
---
So now i can't use my main, and once again a great job from Bethesda 🤷‍♂️
---
Damn, well thanks for lmk
---
Is it possible to link the post? And thank you in advance
---
Thanks for keeping us posted on what you're doing mate. Keeps my work day from getting boring!
---
Very cool pics! Thank you for sharing these!
---
Anyone having issues actually starting the event? Vinny seems to not be hosting any events. Even if I got to my private world he was not starting, and that event is world based, not player based.
---
This worries me.  I've not played since before wastelanders and the seasons interest me.
---
I like the way the seasons work in Division and Destiny, can go all in and finish them in less than a week, moderate effort and finish in a month, or take your time and finish just before the end.
---
Everything I'm reading suggests the fact I didn't start playing yesterday means I have already jeopardised my ability to finish it in time.  Fear of missing out makes me want to not bother starting at all.
---
Dude if you go by just the challenges yes it'll be hard but with exp and publics its gonna be super easy I think I got to rank 10 in about 2hrs
---
I did 6 Events yesterday - Scorched Earth, Heart of the Swamp, Path to Enlightenment, TeaTime, Feed the People and Uranium Fever. I got 1250 SCORE for Daily (Complete an Event) and 1000 for weekly (complete an Event while in group 5 times)..
---
Not a single SCORE more.. For me it\`s quite obvious, that Public Event do not give any more SCORE. But the should.. absolutely.. they should.
---
We definitely need some truly difficult endgame content, or a max level increase for the enemies, which I'm kind of hoping for with One Wasteland, but I've seen nothing to indicate it will happen
---
I want to see level 100+ enemies once in a while
---
Like a Lvl 150 location boss (the ones with the crowns) which right now aren't much stronger than their minions
---
150 atoms to skip one rank
---
People like to buy them or trade them for other ammo types
---
You just said 2 replies ago that they said they could add extra content for fallout 1st and now you say that they didn't mention a paid tier. That's false in 2 ways, first they HAVE NOT excluded the possibility of fallout 1st tiers, to the contrary, they have said it could be a possibility and second, there already are paid tiers since you can pay to unlock tiers.
---
To reach the end maybe--but I think even the most casual player who is mindful of the daily and weekly objectives (Ie EAT THAT BUBBLEGUM) will get much farther than you'd think. I was assing about and got like 5 or 6 tonight in very little time.
---
Sometimes I forget to bring mine with me.  But, if I use the one that's there, I always drop it by the grave after I'm done.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer\_rank](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)
---
We will see.
---
A full building team+inspirational+well rested+Cannes meat stew works wonders. I leveled up at least 5 times.
---
Most season passes ( battle passes ) work like that though? If you miss a week or two your basically out, they may give a say 3-4 week amount of bonus points but it’s meant for people who only play their game really.
---
Truth
---
You earn 1500 atoms as you level up so it shouldn't cost anything
---
People don’t pay attention to the timers or repair queues. They just want to pewpew and frolic around.
---
How is this possible I got to rank 10 In about 2hrs and it took you 12 i feel like your off more than on
---
I thought this was the case with those weekly challenges...but when I investigated further it does require 5 for each of those...BUT when you scroll down, there is actually like about 8 things to complete or choose from. ☺️☺️☺️
---
Feels like i am playing a mobile survival game lol
---
Ballistic bock was working for me yesterday, blight soup wasn’t tho. Seems to be quite a few bugs
---
I wouldn’t trust this guys math fully lol
---
I just recently hopped in to d2 from the warmind update when it costed money...yeah shits the same...
---
I hear you man. Totally. 
---
I, on the other hand, am a solo player and always have been. 
---
I think the new teams are really cool! Don’t get me wrong. It’s nicely done imo. But I just don’t use teams that much.
---
It's the objectives. People just refuse to read them. That said, One Violent Night is one of the events where people will try and extend the time until the last possible minute for more exp. Any other event that requires actually following objectives isn't really worth going to unless you've got a team you know well enough to be sure they can/will read the words written on the screen telling them how to complete the event. It's not uncommon to go to Encryptid and see a dozen players over level 200 that don't even seem to know what a pylon *is*, let alone that they're supposed to activate them.
---
I can and did last night.
---
Its fucking SUMMER and they expect people to play every single day? Fuck that I'm going camping and enjoying the real world while the weather is nice.
---
It’s just fascinating hahah. Given me a right laugh
---
This is why I'm glad I used the Rocksy glitch to get my ammo machine. It's way faster at making 200 rounds for me. It made me 500 rounds before I could finish the daily challenges.
---
I mean go farm super mutants it’s what 100-200 a kill right ? ( I forget actual numbers )
---
Just throw a grenade in the corner by the case.  It blows the stuff out onto the floor most times.
---
Couldn't* care less.
---
So juicehead also stated he was randomly getting score...i noticed this too...was doing nothing and just gained 1000
---
no legendary perks? are you going to release this at the last day of summer or what?
---
It’s been the same in two years
---
Yeah exactly. 
---
Lol sounds nice man. Enjoy that a lot please!
---
&gt;If so, why not start a new character just for the level up challenges? Might not be ideal, but no more missing out!(:
---
Yeah, i had to do that  Ive recently started a new play through, im 36 hours in and 15 levels. Got bored of my OP Build &amp; weapons and wanted to do all the missions again. But I saw yesterday like the robot challenge would be easier on my main so i just hopped on him and got it out of the way.  Finished all other objectives on my low level. I think it´s nice to have at least two charachters to make some objectives more easily obtained.
---
I've heard that scorched earth is rewarding 1000 score if you launch the nukes yourself at least. 
---
Personally i haven't got anything yet from other events.
---
I just grab 1 from whitesprings golf course before I go. Roughly at snake icon on map. Near a red tractor. Then I drop it at the grave when I'm done.
---
Although I never do the quest as dont see any unique benefit
---
Bock doesn't work on some heavy weapons right now which heavy weapons is the only thing I even use.
---
I got some from Scorched Earth recently, and that + Encryptid seem to be the only ones with it functioning currently. I'm mostly going off what people are saying for the latter, and while I don't have a screenshot I definitely got some for Scorched Earth.
---
The legendary run was not a part of the PTS
---
4*...well 5 soon?
---
Thank you so much for saying it every time I post something like this I get downvoted to hell. People just need somthing to complain about.  I think they forgot that its FREEEEE content. What your mama never told you not to look a gift horse in the mouth
---
It's for Daily "Challenges" completed, Not daily events.
---
100% downvote for praising their continued effort to give us nothing and calling it content
---
I haven't seen anything for the long-term, though I'm sure someone is working on that sort of thing now. But, as a start, if you complete all of the first days' dailies and all non-repeatable weeklies on the first day, you'll be a few hundred points (400, to be exact) shy of Rank 10. I believe it takes 9900 SCORE to reach Rank 10, and you an earn 9500 from the first batch of dailies and weeklies.
---
I'm sitting at 200/1225 headed from Rank 10 to Rank 11, so I've completed the repeatable 6 times so far. Going to keep track of it just to see how this grind will actually go overall.
---
Is there a time limit for the first season?
---
Well... I know for sure there's a repeatable daily quest for SCORE.
---
I’ve done 6 Encryptid since last night (myself).
---
No SCORE.
---
A river is still faster at gaining dirty water as you can spam the river to pick up 50 dirty waters in a few seconds. Another useless reward that got scrapped right after building.
---
The solution is simple. Cut the costs of all the reward tiers by 2/3rds
---
Legendary perks
---
This is why I complete them 100% anyway. Just in case you know. 
---
The problem is that they give you score at 3/5. Weird but I guess it’s a big to our advantage this time
---
The item itself is indicative of something greater with regards to how the dev team operates. If it was a crappy ATX item, we could choose to not buy it.  
---
This, however, is a sign of the quality of design we should expect from Bethesda.
---
Thank you. Same statement still applies. Didn't say events. Said dailies. 👍
---
It's a mobile game.
---
Because it was offered to us as those that dont have the time or patience can skip ahead.
---
The truth is you have to skip ahead or you wont complete it even if you grind every challenge
---
There’s the 10k exp which is actually easy didn’t realize how much exp I make in a daily run and also public events giving score
---
Ok, I'll keep track of the next challenges to verify that. Thanks guys 😊👍🏻
---
The fastest I can convert using this method, due to the terminal redraw speed would be about a thousand rounds every five minutes. It will still take me more than an hour of spamming the enter key and alternately buying other ammo types to go through this backlog of all the ammo. This is still unreasonable and I will just drop the ammo.
---
It will take less time to go gather lead, steel, acid, and cloth, which would be more fun.
---
I’ll try dropping a nuke this morning.
---
Ah that makes very sad sense...
---
Ha ha glad you enjoy my witterings at least. I can also confirm no for Uranium fever also right now for me. 
---
On to the robots!
---
Dude you fucked up, look at what they did. Why'd you allow this.
---
It’s just hilarious to watch, also saw a failed fort defiance purely as nobody would repair with somebody standing right next to it. It’s been hilarious to observe it
---
just did Scorched earthe - got none. I checked my score before because i wanted to be sure.  I didnt launch the nuke myself though
---
That's what I figure is why they didn't do XP sharing in the first place. However, at this point, they need to allow for something otherwise it just ends up being a slog when you try to team up, rather than actually feeling like its a solid benefit for everyone involved. Teammates, when you're leveling up early on, feel more like a detriment than a help. I agree that a certain radius should definitely be involved, but also make it so that its only like half the XP per kill if you didn't  get a hit in. Will power leveling be a problem? Sure. But it still is even right now. Plenty of ways to do it with minimal risk involved for the low level characters. But due to this lack of an XP share that was likely an attempt to stop/slow power leveling, actual teams that are trying to level together suffer for it.
---
Yeah I’m where you are, I thought there might’ve been one, if I knew how to go about making it, I’d do it, but terrible at the math etc lol 👍
---
Just did SE - didnt get any
---
Do it yourself
---
Nice... But I'd rather put the super mutants down. I don't think it would be that bad with the public team xp buffs.
---
It's clear that the people who designed it do not play the same types of games we do.  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if their videogame experience stopped at candy crush. There's nothing wrong with that- but it makes sense given their design decisions.
---
&gt;s now with my spare 5 points from adrenaline.  Also have no idea which weekly challenges I still have left to do since they randomly complete way before they are actually done.  
---
&gt;Saw all the ammo converter posts yesterday and figured it couldn't be that bad until I unlocked and used it this morning.  The arbitrary categories for ammo types is just baffling.  Why not ju
---
Wait, What´s the news on Adrenaline? was it nerfed or bugged out after the update?
---
Really? Doesn’t even give me the option. Ok thanks.
---
You can skip ahead after week two, no?
---
Floating through his bed for me today.
---
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
---
If you can manage 10 ranks a week you'll make it by the end of the 10 weeks. The weekly challenges got me to rank 10 within the first day, so each week it's absolutely doable to make 10 ranks on the weekly challenges alone. That's cutting it pretty close, of course, but the daily challenges should shave a few ranks off as well within each week. Haven't got any exact timetable or specific math done or anything, but it seems more plausible after seeing the system in action for the first day. Prior to the release of the score system, I honestly thought all but the most hardcore players would be able to manage without spending atoms to rank up.
---
Easier to use the Rocksy glitch too to get the ammo machine faster. I'm ready to start using more exploits, glitches and dupes. If they can't respect my time I don't respect their game and I'll cheat to get what I want. Not going to cheat to ruin other's game time but just to gain things for myself to use personally.
---
You don't think they saw the hundred posts about it on this forum yesterday?
---
I was able to turn in about 200 Fusion vcells
---
Cushioned Legs give 5% less fall damage each, or Custom Fitted which reduces AP drain while sprinting.  Depends on what you are looking for.
---
What do you mean? I’m referring to the ammo converter.
---
Better then a lazy fuck
---
Same here. I felt it a grind to get ballistic fibre to repair my armor, to go find more ballistic fibre. It honestly started to feel like mowing my lawn, a never ending struggle in the jungle, and i assure you my name isn't Hank Hill.
---
Will be interesting to see if it's bugged or you have to launch yourself.
---
I know they don't aggro one another, but I'm wondering if it somehow \*preserves\* aggro. Not sure how they did it.
---
What’s good about PUBGs season pass is that they allow you to do challenges from previous days if you missed any.
---
Yeah, I 2700 in my stash but like I said it won’t give me the option in the terminal.
---
Explains a lot, thank you! I got the bat paint for my assault rifle and just thought "?????"
---
Fully bonded building team+canned meat stew+well rested+Inspirational works wonders.
---
It literally just doesn’t work. If I wasn’t sure it wasn’t for everyone I wouldn’t posted this but on all the fallout pages and even some threads here people are saying it’s not working at all
---
I think a bulk option would be better. Say craft 20 10mm using the bullets plus cloth. Creates a box of ammo to can then sell. Even if it is for very little caps at least it would be worth it
---
Time to bumrush NW.
---
Lol Bethesda does not consider their users peers.
---
You need to have them on you
---
Use radshield in rad zones it's stronger than radx and lasts 10 minutes
---
Can I suggest the text chat mod? I've made quite a few friends on there and the community is small enough that you will quickly begin to recognize us by name. It helped loads with my anxiety since I'm able to communicate to people without having to use the mic. Just a suggestion :)
---
 Obviously nothing will beat having an irl friend to play with but it's the next best thing if you ask me
---
Wait, did anybody else hear this one stomp their foot and cross their arms when they typed this?
---
They instigated the PvP. If they can destroy my stuff because they started a fight, then that's bullshit and needs to be patched out.
---
Lol I just sent you a DM asking you if you got any last night... Because I didn't either.
---
Was it yours or a public team teammate's workshop?
---
Glad my post was helpful -)) I'd also always prefer to do couple more WT/NIRA/HV runs than something that require much more effort/time/concentration.
---
that already been covered...
---
Not sure. They used a Fatman MIRV
---
I got some from Project Paradise during the trough filling phase, didn’t manage to catch how much I got though
---
What a messed up situation...BGS needs to confirm, either way.
---
Yes we can’t conclude anything yet. And they said 1-2 hours per level. So it could potentially cap at some point. Or reset every “chapter” like you said yourself.
---
I hit 7 with only doing some events and my typical sandbox play of helping new players in 4 hours of play.
---
The group XP boosts are nice.
---
I did hit queen every nuke though.
---
Now it’s back to inventory management lol SO MUCH MEAT!
---
It was mine. I was on a private world, by myself at the time.
---
It's nice to get the info from someone specifically testing it, give the bots (at AWOL I assume) a whack from me.
---
It probably was part of the XP challenge,  not event-based.
---
So you blame an entire company over one of their employees?
---
Even more stupid you blame Todd Howard for something he doesn't even work on.
---
Agreed.  If there is a feature where if you launch the nuke yourself at prime you get 1000 then stuff like that needs to be in the patch notes.  The patch notes should be a complete collection of every single change and fix and addition.  They always leave stuff out and it makes us guess and speculate at everything.
---
Nope I still haven’t gotten the repeatable XP challenged completed yet.
---
I know, just tried to find an alternative for your cells.
---
On PC, there might be a few apps to automate key presses. That would make using this thing painless and quick.
---
Encrypted and Scorched earth give 1000+ score each. Big help right there.
---
Ok thanks
---
This seems completely fucked. It will likely actually make me, someone addicted to the game quit. I don't like missing out on rewards and likely if I can't hit 100 ill just quit the game because ill write off caring about more rewards
---
Are u suprised though? 🤣
---
Wait, there is score for doing events? Is this for every event or just some?
---
I'll check my math but I did a scorched earth and didn't have and extra 1000 to account for. I'll check.
---
Good write up. My two cents. I completed all the daily and weekly challenges last night in about two hours. From there I was just grinding XP for the repeatable XP reward. I made it to rank 11 in a couple hours.  
---
Four hours of playing and I’m at rank 11. If you know where to farm the big XP the repeatable one can be completed a few times an hour. 
---
It still makes it for a long grind to rank 100 but still manageable well within the seasons time frame in my opinion.
---
Maybe we have different definitions of what a tier is. 
---
And no being able to skip a level is not a paid tier lol
---
Make me glad that I’ve got a steel mill under my camp, or I’d be pretty salty about spending 100+ steel playing repairman on every event that features a robot or machine worth defending and fixing because no one else can be bothered to lend a hand
---
FYI in One Violent Night you don't want to play instruments. Just turn jukebox on here and there to drag the event out the full 30 minutes. You can get several max lvl legendaries this way. Who cares about the lvl 40 at the end.
---
I saw that post too but it's hard to say how accurate that is just adding up challenges. Like I played quite a bit in public teams doing events last night and got a decent amount from stuff that wasnt challenges (I'm going to pay more attention tonight to see exactly how much and from what)
---
But the main thing is I think we're letting ourselves get carried away by what's mostly speculation at this point. I'll be curious to see the info when/if people start finishing the track (without buying). It is the first season after all so I'll save my judgements for later into it.
---
It's completely broken.
---
I like the idea of the seasons, so far the rewards all seem.. eh  ok the ammo thing was what I was REALLY looking forward to and to hear its poo, along with not getting SCORE from the events its like.. why play now again?  If you miss even ONE DAY you cannot get close to rank 100.  
---
Being that I'll never set foot in anything PVP related, thats even farther behind I'll be.  Even IF I played more then I normally do, I might get to rank 50 or 60.  That's.. disheartening.  (I've gotten in about 600 hours since I started playing again in Nov2019.  (Private worlds brought me back)
---
Hahaha, yep, outclassed there XD though mine usually gets sold before it gets nearly to that level.
---
Had a similar thing happen when I was leveling up in the bushes during the last double XP. Down to final few in the match. I thought it'd be funny to run at the other guys and just start punching. One of them puts his gun away and boxes me bareknuckle. Then his teammate shot me. One of my favorite NW matches for sure.
---
That’s it. Thank you.
---
I am at level 10 and it now takes 1200 score to advance.  That means that at 10 levels, the score cost to advance has gone up 20% or 2% per level avg.  At that rate It will cost 2k to level up at rank 50 and 4k at 100.  I hope the increase of cost to advance isn't fixed at 2% per level. That would make completing the season nearly impossible without spending atoms.
---
For those that wont be on every day. Considering you get 150 atoms every 10 so rank 10 -90 that totals 1,350 atoms. You could in effect use all those atoms to buy the last levels to get up to 100 this reducing the need to hit that much score
---
Its lag would be my best guess.  Happened to the fiance last night.  She joined late but did enough damage for a queen kill and got her body loot but never got scorched earth to pop in her pip boy so she didnt get the quest rewards aka the flux and armor piece.
---
Weird thing was the queen was bugged and never left the ground so instead of the endless strafing runs she just summoned adds over and over and over.  Was great at first then rapidly became a lag fest with the redonkulous add spawns and all the sub 50's doing corpse runs.  Its rather impressive how fast a trio of mirelurk kings can rip through an unsuspecting war party.
---
We are on PS4 if that matters.
---
If management's focus would be to get things out quickly this would all be options on the tinkerbench.  This looks like a lot of effort for a really obtuse option.
---
POGGERS
---
The Daily: Complete an event only awards 250.
---
10 weeks
---
Accurate
---
Yes my thoughts exactly. 
---
This FOMO effect really do work the opposite way of intended as well. 
---
You don’t wanna make milestones so hard to complete it almost feels impossible. 
---
But when all that is said. 
---
We don’t know yet if the XP required resets per “chapter” (you know it changes colors in the score board after certain levels) 
---
Or maybe caps at some point. But right now it feels like a really really hard thing to do when you’re limited mostly to dailies. 
---
Ofc if you’re a team player the new team thingy is really useful regarding the repeatable XP challenge that also awards score
---
I need to confirm this but I was thinking each objective was worth a part of the whole.  So if there are 5 objectives and total completion gets you 1000 points then each objective is 200 points.
---
I'm sorry I can't confirm and won't be able to check until this evening.  Can someone verify?
---
This.  It is the best option by far.
---
It may be a huge grind but you could earn it all without spending atoms. There's a repeatable weekly quest but it's only for 100 and it's for 10k exp.
---
Seen that lately too, it's as if they don't understand the concept. Uranium Fever too, I'll see people standing by an extractor and all three need to be repaired, but people just refuse to pay attention.
---
I think a lot of it has to do with the increased popularity of the game after wastelanders. When 76 came out, it was primarily fallout/RPG players that played it, all accustomed to reading objectives. But now we've got players from much more simplistic games coming in, who can't grasp anything more complex than "point and shoot." 
---
There's also been a massive increase in the "someone else will do it for me" mentality in the last couple months. Been running campfire tales every time it comes up to get the backpack mod for my alt, and I'm the only one who bothers putting kindling in the fire almost every time. When I did that event with my main when the event was new, everyone made a routine of running back and forth from fire to trees killing things between trips to gather kindling.
---
I really wish BGS could just use Confluence to post the complete patch notes for us.....
---
I’m going to launch a nuke after my first conference call this morning.
---
I don’t have any other challenges that would complete , so it should be a clean test.
---
I didn’t even realize that they’re all listed on that page, thanks for this as well!!
---
it looks like a face that gives you a fingers on its eye-sockets
---
Nice.  I'm super eager to know the results of your test as I won't be online for quite a while.
---
I think of it like a contractor and construction crew that builds a house and then says fuck it once it’s done and sold.  Then if you have problems you have to jump through hoops to get some random redneck that smells like cigarettes to show up at some random time to half ass jury rig a problem with duct tape.
---
I know this sounds oddly specific but homeowners will get it.
---
Well maybe new players then?
---
Why are you such a bully?
---
I’ll let you know. The wife might get pissed, but I need to know before I start wasting ammo and cards.
---
Uranium Fever is bad for that. I go through so much steel repairing the extractors, often when players are standing near them ignoring that they are down. i dont know if it makes any difference to rewards
---
They’d just roofie him.
---
Hmm if this is true it’s weird that it isn’t mentioned anywhere specific. 
---
But yeah I will check as well bud.
---
That makes sense. I played about that long but was on my private world most of the time. Haha I get the same meat management problem when I take all the workshops. Those defend events really pile it on.
---
Their numbers actually are not correct. Total score is only 220,275. Level 1 is free. 
---
Anyway I agree with your other points!
---
They are about to take away everyone's gear on a yearly basis, Destiny is even worse now.
---
My aim is to reach the end of the journey.  If the end is unreachable, I'll just not bother starting it in the first place to be fair.
---
Before you ask why, you need to understand that everything is pixels.  The stuff people want is pixels they want to look at.  I want to look at the pixels that say I reached the end.  For me, no-one else.
---
Angry turtle just made a video about this https://youtu.be/qSzfAWPhodo
---
But the score stays the same but score needed for each rank rises as you progress so doing weeklies and dailies while it has started at giving almost 10 ranks it will only drop from here. You have to XP aswell
---
&gt;Sigma 1000+(25n) where n is 0-99
---
Should be n=0 to n=98 as we are starting at level 1 and not level 0.
---
Why do you have to get to 100?
---
I've missed many 95% shots but one-shots killed with 0%. It's like they're not even trying anymore to build a proper game.
---
I see your point, but look:
---
Just to get to play NW I need to remove my custom.ini with hundreds of mods everytime I decide doing so.
---
After that time needs to be spent pointlessly to wait in the lobby until all the players gather and the match starts.
---
Next it's gonna be good not to be OPKed by some hacker the minute you finally entered the game.
---
Next you need to start hiding from everyone which leads to a lot of anxiety for many of us. I don't really like all these adrenaline peaks and stuff. Too damn stressful for me at least. It doesn't even compare to building couple walls and stairs and be done with it for the week :D
---
Next you need to find the damn stimpaks (and it's one of the easier challenges as far as I've seen in the past from what the game had to offer for NW dailies) and take some damage to be able to use 'em, while fearing to be shot at and starting all over...
---
And in case of success I finally need to put back my .ini file.
---
And also never forget not to mess things up by starting NW BEFORE the main game and triggering a bug that makes many of the weekly/daily challenges to autocomplete without rewards. People (my friends too) already started to report that this is still a thing.
---
Well, I'd rather do couple additional west-tek runs tbh...
---
I’m gonna give you an upvote in the fact that your getting to much hate and I understand where your coming from but on the other hand Bethesda does need to pick up there game in the sense that they are still treating it like it’s just a cash grab
---
Maybe because that's how they like to play. The game doesn't revolve entirely around YOU and YOUR build and play-style, and killing them for playing the game how they want and not how YOU want it makes you seem like an entitled prick.
---
Sounds like a gacha game if you don’t log in one day it throws of the rewards so it forces you to play every day
---
Oh I'm aware...exotics, armor and weapons...which we get re-rolls of.
---
I don't get it either. Why didn't you just repair and activate the jukebox? That alone is enough to do the event on time. 
---
No excuse for high levels not completing OVN as it's an easy one. Even if you have to carry the objectives yourself.
---
I played Project paradise today and for the first time that Ive seen, all 3 animals were alive at the end including a level 0 bloodbug. I even got the bear arm plan. Wasnt the stimpak diffuser plan i was hoping for but maybe with public teams there will be more chances of success. Mind you I tried it again tonight and there was only me and another player and we failed miserably.
---
still there on xbox
---
That should be a PSA, thanks.
---
Welcome to the shared universe of pain that is online game Seasons...
---
Having played through several Fortnite Battle Passes with my kids, this is pretty much par for the course in most games. They design it for maximum engagement. At least here the rewards are decent. FN had my kids grinding for level 350 just to get an ugly skin style they would literally never use.
---
I think they’re prices being 25% of what they are now would be fair. Instead of 1200 for a pack it should be 300, since we can only get atoms from the stupid score board now.
---
Well, it might take more runs, but still. Throw in NIRA/Huntersville/Steakhouse and you're golden :D
---
Haha, it’s not like I literally bought the game last week while owning game pass...
---
I’m also on Xbox, I’ve double checked the emotes section of the Atom Store and annoyingly it’s still not there.
---
Don't share the rad sponge one, or most people will leave pretty quick considering how popular bloodied is :D
---
Your suggestion is, make the ratio better and farm your own ammo to supplement the shitty rate of return that the machine gives.   Noted.
---
don t be too excited about the ammo machine, it s unusable, hopefully they ll remake it better
---
Well I still have as of this morning 83 hrs left to download so looks like I'm screwed. Also bc I can only get on maybe a couple hours a week. Once the download is finished, think it's time to cancel FO1st,  and cut my losses.
---
I did Scorched Earth as well, and got nothing for it. Haven't run Encryptid, Project Paradise, or Radiation Rumble yet, but of all the various events I've run otherwise, none have given me SCORE.
---
While I agree you will really need to log in everyday to actually get level 100, the 10K xp is easy to unlock.  I only played for a couple hours yesterday on a private server using a Public Event Type Team and hit that 10K repeatable 4 times.
---
Cause I’m a good ol’ fallout collector fan my friend. I’m sure there’s many here like me. 
---
But ask yourself this. Why use all this time on skins and etc. that maybe only a small amount of players will achieve. Seems like waste of work almost if you ask me. 
---
Normally with seasons like this they’re fairly easy to max out if you just play regularly. But if the numbers from the other posts are correct. You will not even get near even if you do EVERY single daily including the NW ones. (Which I’m personally not a fan of lol)
---
I got randomly awarded 200 atoms
---
Doing the math, I agree. I play casually not,  fanatically. I don't want to feel like I need to be on the payroll, I've already stopped playing games because of their idea of around the clock play to earn rewards.
---
I noticed this yesterday too. My main uses herbivore but I always carry some radstag or ribeye for the carry weight buff. As of yesterday, that's gone. Bummer. I don't know of any plant recipes that buff carry weight.
---
PSA: drop your good ammo in the stash first. The converter only shows ammo in inventory,  so you can safely spam click. Its still slow as balls for large quantity. I'd rather leave most of my unwanted ammo on my vendors for 1c
---
For some reason Balistic Bock works with the Gauss shotgun
---
Have they applied a fix to events yet that yield the better rewards for those thatve put more effort into the event goals?
---
I remember talk about this and a while back and finding myself in a situation like yourself I didn't see it on 2 SBQ fights, but in another where I did a ton of SBQ damage I got the score.
---
Could be a complete coincidence but still
---
My husband and I ducked out a while back. The “battle pass” design and criticism of it (insane grind forcing you to pay) has made us decline to return.
---
There’s your feedback.
---
F
---
I don't think I do either, thanks for reminding me, I need to check in the atom store.
---
I hear that! Me and two of the boys were doing a naked nuke zone run, made possible via some rad perk cheesing on our part. Well, a rando running bloodied joined our squad, but got so mad about it that he reported us all lol
---
I dont have the points in charisma atm to share more than a lvl 1 perk. I try and share either Travel Agent or the one that can repair guns a bit. I dont have too many level 1 cards available unfortunately. Im interested in preferences too
---
Well yeah, you bought the game at the time you did, as is. If this was a subscription thing, sure I'd be pissed and want a bit more say, and the FO1st guys seem to have valid grievances.... I'd just stop paying/playing. But all this crap coming that I don't have to pay an extra dime for? I'm not complaining.
---
And it's not like we actually own the game. We got a license agreements we paid for to play it. At the end of the day, it's their game to do as they damn well wish. Our say stops at our wallets. If devs for games want what's in our wallets, they would do well to listen to those who own those wallets.
---
They should, but they don't have to.
---
I used to love Tripwire Interactive's games like Killing Floor and Red Orchestra.... But then they started changing crap, added an "expansion" of Rising Storm you had to pay for that got slapped into Red Orchestra 2. You didn't have to pay for it, but it was downloaded and shoved into the game whether you wanted it or not, meaning extra drive space used.
---
The whole game was there and all its maps were thrown into the RO2 map line up, so when the server switched to a Rising Storm map, you loaded in too, but restricted to a bolt action rifleman and gain zero XP for the match or anything you do.
---
You know, unless you shell out the money they wanted. So eventually I did, but I didn't even like Rising Storm or its game play, environment or most of the weapons.
---
After that, I was done with their games. Haven't played or bought one of their games since.
---
End rant.
---
Point taken, hope it doesn't get removed. Peace out!
---
Really?  The challenge auto completing thing was fixed for me but that sucks that it wasn't fully fixed for everyone.
---
Yeah I mean, that's unfortunate that you have to remove the files and stuff which is pretty annoying.  And I have seen the hackers you guys have on PC and I agree that its BS.  I guess on Xbox in 150+ NW overseer ranks I have never encountered a hacker or cheater so I have a different perspective on Nuclear winter.  It makes sense that we view the challenges differently now. Best of luck to you ranking up your pass.
---
Weird it works full screen for me
---
Any time!
---
They should, but it does not seem consistent. We need to get some info on which events really do award score. I completed a ton of them within the last 9 hours and didn't notice score awards even once (except for the times when it was 100 score for yet another 10000xp weekly that got triggered with the event's xp reward)
---
Stop whining
---
Sadly it seams to be true.
---
Oh, got it. Thank you! &lt;3
---
Omfg, they broke this TOO?
---
RTX-Off
---
Ha I don't think I'd go that far but it doesn't surprise me at all. 
---
I've been sharing strange in numbers constantly personally, mmy usual friends stopped playing and got bored of the end game grind so it's nice to get my superhero status back again reliably.
---
The feel the easy and also-keeping-commercials fix is to increase the amount of exp gained by the repeatable weekly. Perhaps to 250 or even 300.
---
And then climb on top of the display to get the Helmet. If you're having trouble, jump in PA and press yourself against the wall, you should be able to select it.
---
So you would prefer having to pay into a battle pass rather than having it free to participate?
---
I did all the weekly's as fast as I could, then I wanted to legendary farm for a bit so I nuked whitesprings on a private, then I ran a bunch of events, but the gain didnt really start until I started being at events alone more kills means more xp
---
I was making ammo on my dads workbench when I was 8.  It’s fairly simple and would be a cool looking machine.  [Like This](https://leeprecision.com/load-master-38-special.html) I don’t see why we can’t do this with a perk that would reduce the amount of lead and gunpowder lost.
---
In battle pass lingo a tier is the levels you can unlock and if you can pay to unlock a tier that means the game has paid tiers lol
---
Well damn I missed out on a daily so I guess I’m fucked
---
nah im ight
---
Which is hilarious considering their stance on modders importing assets from previous fallout/elder scrolls games to help with total overhauls/fan remakes and the like
---
You don't have to grind. You don't have to do the battle pass. You don't have to do battle royale. You can discover lore. You can worry about ammo (?). You can scavenge. Nothing is stopping you playing it how you want to. 
---
Companions? You can get a pet soon. Whether you can take it with you i don't know.
---
I made the mistake of trying to use the ammo converter while still in power armor.  When you try to use the terminal it's hilarious and infuriating.  You line up, like you're going to start typing, then suddenly you swoop past the screen to a slot that opens up like you just bought a cheap toy from those Wal-Mart vending machines.
---
Milk of human kindness?
---
Youll find it under your junk tab
---
Although I agree with what you said, the point of 76 was never to be another fallout game. It was pretty clear since the announcement that FO76 was to other Fallout games what ESO is to Elder Scrolls.
---
It's not that easy for many reasons, so yeah...
---
Anyway, thanks and good luck to you too!
---
*Laughs in dark matter power amor with jetpack*
---
Why the Shishkebab?
---
OP is wrong though. His math is wrong and also ignores other ways of getting score.
---
Now if only they'd give us a clean toilet...
---
Well. Gone grinding! See you in a few weeks!
---
If you mean claiming it into your inventory, just go to the Legenndary Run map and claim it there. If you’ve already done that, it’ll be in your characters junk
---
&gt; but it feels like a grind and more of some mmo/ competetive game like most games in the industry and not like a game where i can log on and explore the wasteland with my companion, discover lore, worry about ammo and scavenge and just relax. 
---
I mean, other than the companion part (real friends make much better companions than NPCs btw) you can do exactly that.  Just log on and explore and relax.  No one is making you grind gold bullion or grind the battlepass.  No one NEEDS every single cosmetic item in the game.  We as players have a choice in what we want to make of this game.
---
I have spent way more hours just exploring in 76 than I have in all the other fallout games combined.  Why?  Because I can do it with a real living and breathing person at my side that I can enjoy the game with and I truly believe the story-telling they did with notes and holotapes and terminal entries pre-wastelanders was some of the best storytelling in the entire fallout universe.
---
The game is exactly what you make of it.  That's part of the beauty of it.
---
Just done 2 scorched earth events on Xbox, and no score rewarded, so it seems very inconsistent
---
I tired to use it but it was taking so long swapping in 12 rounds at a time. I ended up dropping the ammo I don't use, someone else can go through the headache.
---
Watched a bunch of new people join, use 3 stimpacks, then yeet out. Path of least resistance.
---
Arent there atoms in the reward tiers?
---
Thanks, I expected some limit
---
Yep 😤
---
It’s a multiplayer spinoff. Of course it’s going to feel like an morpg. That’s what it is.
---
u/ladydevann u/CM_PipBoy
---
Can you confirm whether (or which) public events should be awarding SCORE please? There's alot of speculation going on about the acheivability of Rank 100.
---
Heck, I'd do all of those places anyway.  Those are the *fun* spots.
---
My actual xp farming run is:  Westek, Whitesprings, DMV, Huntersville, NIRA, Steakhouse, Grafton Dam, Prime and Alpha. Go down the road from Abbie's bunker to Dyer Chemical and kill all the high level enemies.  Rinse and Repeat.  Throw in my dailies, and whatever public events that I can hit and that is pretty much a wrap. I hope that is enough to get to rank 100 (seasons) but that remains to be seen.
---
If history is any indication, Two weeks at the very least but probably more like a full month.
---
its not fallout tho, pretending its not there is just worse things like the story sucks compared to other fallouts
---
Yes, silly us for not including a requirements spec document in our need to change crap ammo into useful ammo. Lets do that next time, willing to help write the 40 page documentation needed, just hmu.
---
Events definitely do not give score unless completing a challenge this score system is bunk
---
It's been out for literally one day. Nobody knows if the xp required for a level caps out yet and nobody has calculated event score.
---
I really dont get it imo fallout76 is my favorite game of all time! I play it all day every day.
---
ok actually that s good he is wrong, hopefully we all can make our way to end season 1 without having to pay
---
Blame Jimmy.
---
If you are talking about the Uncle Sam salute, did you ever buy the tricentennial pack? If not, it was a bug that you were able to use it the first few weeks.
---
Buy the shielded mod for 200 gold
---
Shielded- 4 strength, 4 endurance, 2 perception. It's the highest special amount of the all the underarmors
---
You got that more than the 1 time for challenge?
---
I have portable toilet, that my treasure😂
---
Imagine saying 76s story is worse than 4
---
On Xbox, sorry.
---
I'm debunking this as myth. 4 individuals including my self ran a scorched earth and no one received score.
---
Can confirm this. Also provides 15DR, 15ER and 15RR.
---
That’s good I guess. I wonder how long it will be on there. I was disappointed to see gta v was taken down.
---
I play Final Fantasy XI as well and on there you collect seals that you then trade in and convert to orbs for boss battles to get loot.  You can literally trade in your entire collection of several different types of seals in a matter of a couple of minutes to get these orbs.  This game is almost 20 years old.
---
Sorry, How do I claim the materials from the package in my junk tab?
---
Lol nooo nooo nooo. Sweet summer child. I gained 4 of the 10k boosts before I leveled up and I’m only 192
---
They fixed the water wheel and gave it power output. Albeit this was a minuscule change compared to bigger problems but people complained.
---
I’m not stressed over it.  I already hit rank 10 in just a few hours yesterday, the first couple were focused on doing the dailies, then I just grouped up with a buddy while he tried to do his dailies and I ended up leveling up a couple of more times and ultimately clearing out the weeklies too. 
---
Once the weeklies are done, doing a few dailies along with my faction rep dailies I should be ok, as long as I can knock them out in a couple of hours daily I can do that no problem, and can block out a bit more game time to do some of the others.  Hardest ones are NW since I have to rely a bit on RNG depending on what the daily is (hard to use 3 stimpaks if I’m not taking enough damage to need them and can’t find them in the first place
---
That’s why I wrote the edit friend &lt;3 
---
But someone still did the math. But yeah let’s see
---
Yes like i said it was casual. Daily quests are a scam on XP best to kill things quickly. Also i am ashamed to say i didn't remember to do any of the XP boosts i mentioned...except canned stew 1/2 way through my session
---
you make good points, but it doesnt do it for some people, if they they make fallout 1st cheaper or free, give u human and animal companions, and more dlc. i dont mind atomic shop coz its basically creation club, but the fact we will have to pay a subscription for mods and permanant settlements is dumb
---
Thanks for the sentiment, but don't bother. Once the pitchforks are out, any sympathizers will get caught in the crossfire.
---
Also a PSA: scrapping them makes daily and weekly scrap collecting challenges a breeze!
---
Has anyone fixsed this yet ive been trying everything with nk lick evan bought a second version of game on bethesda net instead of steam to see if it would hellp and still can't get on
---
BEST case scenario we'll get a fix in 6-8 weeks from now on.
---
Yea but what's cool is you can start a public team and and still play solo and complete the challenges as if you are on a team even though no one is in the actual team with you
---
Alot of people care about PC. Just because you don't does 't mean no one does
---
Skulltrooper
---
&gt;Like they hired someone who worked at a Casino to consult on the game.
---
It's almost as if gaming companies have decided they like gambling mechanics... \*CoughLootboxesCough\*.
---
Did you maybe complete the kill legendary creatures weekly for that score? I think folks who got the supposed score from SBQ are probably getting it from the legendaries or the scorched and the folks in encrypted probably got them from the robots or legendaries as well.
---
I’m ready to be downvoted.
---
I’m not collectively influenced by toxic individuals, so I’ll stand my ground as a neutral party and only make points based on what’s reasonable
---
I was building a large inventory of fusion cores just from daily play. Finally I said stop picking up cores and I drop them at my camp for players to pick up quite often just to get them out of my inventory
---
So you’re saying that lone wanderer perk works or?
---
visually we are starting at 1 yes, but mathematically 0 since we don't incur 25 xp curve on the first rank. If this gets confusing i'll update my formula to account for this like the fallout wiki does.
---
Will the price to buy the rest of the season depend on how far you've gone ? Say, a person at step 10 will pay more than a person at step 90 ?
---
Good question! I shall add to my spreadsheet. Not sure I can upload though.
---
Zorbo's ship is in the same spot for me too. I think it's just a gimmick to keep you chasing him. I'm sure once you reach a pre determined location on the map, he'll move a few spaces to make you feel like you're pursuing him across the galaxy. I'll bet a bloodied fixer he moves to the last space eventually and you will catch him only on the last board space.
---
they sure sold it as a fallout game. they thought it could act as a filler for fallout 5 as its not coming out for a while.
---
Giving us nothing would mean no additions, we had Wastelanders not even that long ago and people are already complainung about there being no further updates. You saw the roadmap stop wondering why we dont get an update that size every month
---
Cranberry relish now gives +20% XP so I was using that in conjunction with kindred spirit.
---
And it's noted and sent.
---
Nope it wasn’t from the legendary kills, at around 5/6 legendary kills so far
---
True, but atoms are sacred and used to by non-score related content. If you are a non-FO1st member like I, you'd know this 0\_0 \*shivers\*
---
What do you mean repeatable?
---
I got the robot early as well with 4/5 killed. After doing all I didn’t get more.
---
Well, they both do now, and if you are for example carnivore you don't seem to get stat bonus from plant foods (and I assume vice versa). It is a new change so I need to explore it a bit more, but it seems you still get the non-stat bonus from plants as a carnivore, just not doubled. 
---
However, both of them have a 10% base XP buff food and a +3 int base food as well. So they can both get the same XP bonuses. If you do any type of melee though you are going to want to stay carnivore for the melee damage bonus.
---
I'm on xbox but what's weird is I got the notice for completion of scorched earth but no flux or armor leg
---
That  tower is giving me a sinking feeling
---
What happens if it falls
---
All that work goes down the drain lol
---
To be fair FO4 had a worse main story then this game imo.
---
I just don’t understand how people can honestly say that this isn’t a “fallout game”. It’s like if Bethesda doesn’t copy and past the previous FO games then it’s somehow not genuine. 
---
I remember when New Vegas came out and the mass hatred it caused. People were saying then how it was not a “real” fallout game and Bethesda ruined the franchise.
---
It seems every new FO game that comes out gets absolutely hated on until the next one releases, then everyone suddenly loves it.
---
I believe the issue is with the AI.  She won’t land for melee attacks if she can’t hit people, and with so many people doing things like standing on top of tents and fence posts. So the AI logic is “I can’t hit people with melee, so continue to do ranged dive bombs”. 
---
I’m melee too, usually I can get enough damage in to get a reward anyways, but I do have a back up heavy weapon build just in case.
---
Strange in numbers, or curator for me personally. Double time on bobbleheads is pretty useful especially if you are grinding out events.
---
What do you get for public events? I've seen 1k, 2k and nothing at all.
---
I was at my camp. After doing the challenge to build up a workshop, I didn't return to it and just let it rot. I even had the quest to defend it going, but I guess he took care of that and then contested it.
---
That's why we start at 0 mathematically but end at 98. That's 99 steps. Which is what is required to reach level 100 starting at level 1. 
---
I had the exact same calculations last night, and realised my mistake.
---
its original story is if ur comparing wastelanders. its like comparing far harbour to it or something ur point is invalid
---
They didnt want to risk exploitation
---
There is a weekly that gives 100 S.C.O.R.E. that you can do multiple times (10k xp each)
---
Scrap it on a bench :)
---
Hi. No, none at all. I've opened a ticket with Bethesda support so hopefully they can tell me what's up. Thanks anyway.
---
That's great news. Might have to hit it up for the first time finally!
---
That happens to me in power armour. You have to exit your PA to view it properly
---
20%???? wtf if thats true back to making it
---
The Event Team Bonus is great!
---
I've never once seen a shovel there I always get 1 from behind the church in flatwood, did this person really shout at you
---
The free item should always be listed under the Sale tab on the Featured item page in the shop
---
It's weightless for me and I dropped them before so I can split my stacks to give some ammo to my friends.
---
Launched 6 worms with friends yesterday, not a single one of us got any score for completion. Definitely don't think this is a thing. I personally launched 5 of the nukes.
---
Ah so there is a third mod. I missed it in the list then. I hate how the whole name doesn't fit and gets cut off.
---
I don’t play destiny but this seems unbelievable. They are really just taking gear away yearly? How are they phrasing it because I would bet if they just said hey your gear resets every year they’d lost a lot of players and you would see a huge uproar.
---
It took me a bit over three hours to hit 9, but there's a reason I didn't try for 10: the game clearly didn't mean for you to push for it, considering your have to complete not just all the dailies but all the weeklies as well to do so.
---
Seems like 500-1000 possibly 500 per normal event and 1k for SBQ, I’m either level 9/10 can’t remember but I only played for a couple hours, once again everyone is freaking the hell out about nothing major, it’s a battle pass their meant to keep people playing their game, most battle passes you can finish upwards of 2-3 weeks early on every game.
---
Probably for friendly fire to heal up teammates and NPCs that are part of quests. For example, I use my heated shishkabab to heal the scavengers in Radiation Rumble.
---
Yes it’s true. Not sure if it’s intended or not as food buffs wasn’t covered in the patch notes. I believe this will only work if you have the herbivore mutation also.
---
as far as i know no, but this is not related to S.C.O.R.E.
---
Its possible people are tying the completion of "kill legendary" enemies to the S.C.O.R.E. coming from the event, as the boss of those events are in fact...legendary ;)
---
there is a gadget like this since launch:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Explosive_bait
---
Tbf most people who work on game don't play the game they work on. Its like being in a band and practicing the same song 10000x, you stay despise it. I've worked on a few game as an artist, And I eventually hate them all. In high end art tech schools like Feng zhu, they literally teach you that If you work on games, you have no time to play games, which to an extent is true. 
---
That being said, this team is beyond ridiculous and they shouldn't be this bad.
---
The numbers given, is that total of for each item? Like 7k for just the beanie or 7k total for the beanie and everything before it?
---
I have a back up two shot explosive handmade but when my billets only do 1-2 damage and my melee does 170 per hit, shooting is just throwing away money
---
its good for variation, besides yes its good with actual real people instead of npcs, but when all ur mates dont want to buy this game after maybe hours of trying to persuade them coz they think its hot garbage its good to have a human npc i guess
---
The Youtubers are probably recording their Ammo Converter videos as we speak.
---
Ohhhh sorry I'm very new to this. Thank you!
---
Good to know, I'll actually get this as it's better than the shielded enclave underarmor (I believe it's called that) I bought from a player vendor.
---
No way, the original story was much better, especially all the small little stories of the people who came before and ended up falling to the scorched.
---
i’m not a gun guy, but why tf is the red dot still on that weird raised sight thing when there is quite literally a rail underneath it that the sight could mount onto? i feel it looks dumb that way
---
you and me both.. 
---
I run a non meta build so I am basically fucked until this gets fixed
---
This is the most obvious thing in the world to do and they instead went for the terminal instead.
---
Not even a particularly good implementation on a terminal either.
---
Nice work both of you. and thanks a lot.
---
Okay well there's some wonky shit going on then given the disparity of reports. Bethesda needs to clarify and fix whatever isn't working, 'cause it sounds like pubic events are seriously messed up and bugged out from what you and others are saying.
---
I launched multiple yesterday and didn't get score for any of them. I really don't think that it is actually rewarding for the event.
---
That's the setup at the Wayward Inn.  Everyone else says it's too hard to do with the camp system being buggy as it is. I think that if they use the conduit mechanic to just get the line to the house, then call it done that would be simple to implement.
---
Yeah it can get tough to get people to try the game.  All of my real-life friends quit after they took out vault 94 because we no longer had any difficult group content to do.  All of the people I play with know are folks I met in-game, here or on the forums, or on twitch.  Meeting people is good too.
---
This is a very good thing.
---
Sadly, new content and resources (for bug fixes, etc) are going to be directly tied to profit. Getting a huge influx of new players should result in more money coming in. More money should equal more resources allocated to the game.
---
Plus having more new players to help out will be fun.
---
I thought it was just me not paying attention. But yeah awarded at really strange times.
---
There was a post yesterday calculating score. In that post the person who did the numbers claimed that if you do only weekly and daily quests, it will take little more than 11-12 weeks to get to lv100. Meaning doing just daily/weekly quests is not enough. You need to either do the 10k xp thing alot, or buy the last ranks with atoms.
---
Yuck
---
I'm glad to hear you recieved your xp and it wasnt just lost.
---
the story to fo76 before wastelanders was almost non existent, ive played this game since beta and ive tried to love it but somehow i just cant, and i dont think everyone will love 76 when fallout 5 comes out  tbh
---
No worries. Here to help.
---
It's BS that you need to play in order to get the freemium monetisation schemes that are normally reserved for free2play games but that ship sailed a long time ago. Bit late to complain about it now.
---
If you're already running full strength you have the slots to use heavy guns which are actually useful against her no matter the situation. You set yourself up away from the bunker and fire away so she aggros onto you and then when she lands you just carry on blasting.
---
I looked at my weeklies, unfortunately on pc I'm mainly a solo player so anything with events or teams is going to be a challenge for me
---
I started a fresh character so im only level 16 atm so that also limits what i can do overall
---
Bethesda even said they didnt want it to be an mmorpg bruh
---
Did you get any score points from queens you did last night?
---
As long as I get my 20 atoms for 7600 hours, I'll be happy /s
---
I want the chickens not for the fertilizer but for some camp life
---
Oh I totally thought they were a camp decoration like storage box type things. Neat.
---
I just confirmed this as well. Did a bit of math and so far I have all the score I should have despite it being buggy.
---
the game is grindy by design
---
5 nukes in one day!
---
If I do one a week I’m happy lol.
---
SCORE challenge counters are probably bugged.
---
I got the 5/5 Robo challenge after just killing 5 mister gutsy’s, the challenge didn’t disappear, and when I actually *visually* got the challenge (Killing 5 different types) done on the UI, I didn’t get SCORE.
---
Anyone who “got score from an event”, probably had their 5/5 weekly event challenge completed early.

14k XP
---
Don't get me wrong it was a nice incentive for waiting 20 mins to find a match...
---
Yes!!! I've been asking for this for a long time.  I have 5 characters all well into the 100s and beyond in levels and I would love to be able to start a pistols build but I don't want to delete any of the characters I have as they all have their own builds and camps and styles and stuff..
---
Hell, I would even pay atoms for it like I paid for character slots in ESO.  Please make it happen!
---
Imagine living in a world where customer feedback is considered "peer pressure". :facepalm:
---
With all the easter eggs in this game referencing pop culture, if they added fishing, I better be able to catch the three eyed fish Blinky from the Simpsons. Make it an ultra rare catch that can be mounted.
---
It's a bit of a pain but if u stay on for a bit you will receive it, side not I'm receiving the Halloween and chrismas items for nuclear winter. So theres that
---
When I play today I'm going to screenshot my challenge menus and every time I get SCORE I'm going to check that against the screenshot.
---
People could be doing things they don't even know about and getting 1000 SCORE.
---
That’s pretty good advice
---
do we know if thats gonna work on fixer too?
---
Create a Building themed public team. Nobody wants to join those because nobody seems to realize it boosts Intelligence which in turn boosts XP. You'll get the bonus for being in a team but will still in all likelihood be playing solo.
---
FO76 doesn't feel like any of the other FO games. You feel so alone, like a true survivor in FO3 and 4 and NV and in FO76 you trip over players left right and centre. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I've made some great friends thru FO76 but yes it definitely doesn't feel like the older FO games.
---
Exactly what I was thinking aha!
---
im quite young tbh and for some people it doesnt fell comfortable meeting random people of twitch or forums tbf
---
Don't worry they'll just forget to credit you some SCORE anyway after you grind for the weeklies.
---
I did the gather materials weekly for a thousand, it shows it as grayed out and everything, yet my total score hasn't moved
---
I wouldn't be to sure about yourself with this. Bethesda has a history of front-loading rewards with this game so it looks like you're getting a ton at first but you soon realise how much little you get for how much effort to get to the later stuff.
---
It was the case with atom challenges (which they nerfed twice!). It's the case with rep grind. It's the case with bullion grind. Why would you even possibly consider things not to be the same with the score too?
---
The Egghead mutation serum is good too at +6 int.
---
didnt find the post I was looking for but apprently for the queen the radius of the effect is smaller as well as the time she stays on the ground.
---
Seems the challenges are kinda bugged overall. Who would have guessed
---
exactly
---
nah,   
---
new update :D  
---
some weird *sh*\-things-*it* happens after every update :D
---
Ill repeat on this post too but I feel the easy fix while keeping the pay-for-convenience transaction (because lets be real, that isnt going away) would be to increase the repeatable weekly (and maybe have it vary from week to week) score gain to something like 250 or 300. That way people who want to put in the effort can be rewarded.
---
You only see your teammates bars since you can't bond with yourself.
---
I'm getting those rewards as well. Like wtf Bethesda it's friggin July 😂
---
Agreed, however I still haven't completed that one yet, however my challenge totals should add up to more than what I have so unsure. Probably will trickle through at a later point...
---
well aint that a kick in the head
---
You could always build a port-a-potty.
---
Well isn’t that interesting
---
Yeah, you should get them if the quest actually pops.  I had similar issues to hers last night with random public events not popping till they were almost complete. Line in the sand and uranium fever.  Both times it was with a lot of other players at the events (10+)
---
The Same thing happened with me, but with the American salute.
---
Oh I do a lil self bonding every morning and evening.
---
Yep, I agree with everything you said. But isn't this Shiney new straw so shiney!? Look at the silly artwork!
---
Yeah, Ive been looking into it, and I dont really like at all that this is essentially a mask to make it harder to earn things in game without paying real money. But hey, at least its a fun and pretty mask.
---
You don't like bathing in a bathtub that looks like how hangovers feel?
---
weird...
---
There are a lot of unknowns right now. It could be even more grindy if the challenge rewards get smaller or fewer in number the further we go along. Maybe the recurring XP bonus isn't much of a chore. 
---
We're Day 1/2 of 70 atm. We have a very long way to go before we really know for certain either way i.e. manageable or near impossible.
---
In a way, they are right, in that the total "value" would be higher. My problem is that you have no choice/selection in the new system. You want that hidden fireplace door? Get cracking, because you're only getting it with full blown investment of time. Meanwhile, I now know that I will never be able to consistently save up Atoms... which also negates any idea I might have of dipping into the pockets to get enough to get the things I want if I can't save enough. At this point, I simply don't care about the atom shop, because if I see something I like, I have no realistic choice but to pay real money for it, because I cannot grind it out or even realistically grind up most of it.
---
Usually on front page. However sometimes (like right now you need to search). This week is under Icons.
---
this shows how bad f76 was made. in skyrim was a big fuzz when we learned dragonrend.
---
here this mechanic was presented during an early quest, most people hated and nobody remember.
---
I love this game, but boy oh boy.
---
Well, I think the real issue is why Bulk Ammo has yet to become a thing in any capacity.  There is no ammo type, other than 5.56 and maybe one other, that is worth 1c apiece.  We have the Tinker's Workbench.  Why not allow us to bulk ammo in appropriate sizes and sell, like, 10 bullets for 1c?
---
The same is true for the game's Ammo vendors.  No one would use those because they charge a bonkers price *per shot*.  They are absolutely useless beginners traps.
---
Since their inception, I've done a freebie vending machine of some form or another.  I used to stock it with ammo.  The problem is, invariably, some schmuck comes along and takes *all* the ammo, regardless of what they actually need.  It's only going to get worse now that they can turn it into something useful with enough clicking.
---
at least fallout 4s story felt like u had consequnce unlike 76s base story
---
I have tried to bond with myself but that's a messy affair.
---
Ty
---
these are the same tasks, in a different format.  im sorry, but things aren't "different", they just prettied up the same package.  whats more, the freedom players did have (in deciding what to do w/ those challenge atoms), has evaporated
---
&gt; it's absurd to say that in order to enjoy the latest rewards you must grind 
---
Everything worth having in Wastelanders is behind several levels of grind and time-gates (reputation, treasury notes, gold bullion). I am not sure why you would be saying this for the seasons. If you don't have time to play, don't play. If you play once a week, play once a week. If you were playing 1 hour per day, as you say, you could maybe get an average of 50 atoms per day. now you get at least a level per day. Any cosmetic reward you get from seasons would be at least 300 atoms in the shop. You are still getting more stuff, FOR FREE. What a lot of people seem to be ignoring, is that a game like this has operational costs that cannot be covered by the initial game price. Bethesda is evolving their strategy to be able to finance the game without making it pay-to-win. It is not easy, but in my books, the seasons is a step in the right direction. We are getting more free stuff, and people that want to pay can have a reason to, without destroying game balance. Noone is going to be better at you because they got to season level 100 and you did not.   
---
What probably irritates you is the fact that your "casual" play-style excludes you from some rewards (like going all the way to lvl 100), but that is always the case with seasonal events and casual players.   
---
Did you "casually" get all Fashnacht masks?   
---
Did you "casually" get all Xmas gift rewards?   
---
Did you "casually" get all Mole Miner pail rewards?
---
Or maybe you just want to get on the Bethesda bashing train like many people here.
---
Enjoy the game and stay safe
---
You will go blind.
---
Idk grinding them out tho I like the pumpkin combat armor and the combat rifle looks nice I feel like I should delete that comment just incase they see it
---
For real why can’t they just buyback in bulk then purchase what we want like a vendor
---
Guessing from the QSB?
---
Seems most games are taking notes from mobile games . They want to keep you logging in everyday for cosmetics , special items with limited time only ! I remember when I played games for fun looking at you fo3 . I think they’ve seen the success other games like fortnight ect hade and are unfortunately following suit . I’m guilty of falling into this trap as well and play a good bit but once starfield, elder scrolls comes out I doubt I’ll play this fallout again.
---
That's what the punch bowl is for.
---
A paid tier implies it is required to pay. Having an option to skip the tier does not make it “paid”.
---
Yeah the shielded lining is a bit further down, it others the best stats, like 4 strength, 3 end, 4 perception soemthing like that
---
I mean kinda how it is with all battle/season passes? You grind the first 70/100 levels in say a couple weeks see the final rewards go hm grind for 2 days for 1 level or buy 25 levels for $20 and most buy the remaining, just sorta how those passes are designed lol
---
Possibly. I don’t play NW a lot, except for the dailies and the ghillie farm before, but it’s always like instant into a lobby. Maybe really try changing the region (maybe even worth trying with a vpn, although lag will be horrible)
---
While leveling up know that you will be asked to pick a Perk card but when you select the card you are also putting a point into the SPECIAL it belongs to. This isn't explained properly so many might not know that. 
---
Also, have fun testing out different weapons and armors for the first couple of levels to figure out what style you might like. You might like a single weapon such as Rifle, Pistol, Heavy gun, or melee. And the same with armor. Try all the types and find what works best for you to make it a better playthrough for you. 
---
I have more but would suggest searching the Reddit to see common suggestions for new players.
---
Great so no quests for 3 months, just dailys and events.
---
I don’t think everyone should be able to make it to the end, it should still be an achievement. That said, an achievement should be achievable lol
---
yeah the patch notes only mentioned they fixed the animation so I was thrilled when I saw they took the feedback and actually turned it into a generator!
---
You added an extra m to my response.
---
just to clarify, i still like 76 and bethesdas dedication, i am still a player but it is certainly not one of my favourite games and not on ill put like 4000 hours in like past fallouts lol, i say that..
---
There have been reports of S.C.O.R.E. not updating in sync. Progressing other challenges seems to help "catch up" the latency on S.C.O.R.E.
---
they are absolutely not right.. how can someone else determine what is of value to ME.. or YOU?
---
c'mon man.. its a clownshoes cash grab...
---
Anybody that bought the parachuter backpack able to tell me if it has physics on the belt thingy? Would love it if something dangled off my backpack and if it does imma buy it at once hehe!
---
I'll add it. I also run that!
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
New Vegas is my least favorite of the fallouts. So much of the early game just felt like Generic Post Apocalypse.  Other than how your stats being called SPECIAL and being given the Pip-Boy, the game could have been basically any other generic end of the world game.  
---
It got a bit better later, and I think some of the DLC was great (loved Dead Money), but i honestly think most people think it’s great simply by looking back through the piss-yellow tinted glasses that filtered the whole desert there.
---
Everythign you wanted to do - explore, discover lore, etc.  is all there.  Companions are replaced with other players, or go it solo.  There’s no grind until you reach end game, Where in theory you’ve completed everything else in the game. All that other stuff you complain about is stuff you don’t have to do unless you wanted to.  You can get to level 50 taking it easy and relaxed.  I’ve done that with 4 characters.
---
It’s better to stay as a team. I joined an event team last night and we were blowing out events in no time. I ranked up about once an hour.
---
I wish she wouldn't waste 70% of my time by flying three miles away then do that stupid strafe attack that does nothing.
---
Did you mean redownload the whole game again? 😮
---
I never bought anything for camp because of the budget, a few water purifiers and some turrets to guard them and i have to delete wall and floors to complete the ‘build camp’ challenges.
---
Oooh that's it. I'm a carno. Anyway, canned meat does not give more xp sitting still at 5% (unless base is 2.5% and i never knew?) So i'd assume the 20% is flat
---
For kb&amp;m, if you drag your cursor off of the terminal while highlighting your last option (ammo choice), you can sit there and spacebar it and itll remember your options as long as you dont bring your cursor back over the terminal.
---
That's what I was thinking. They could just add a feature that says it's connected without needing pipes
---
I mean, they literally compared it to ESO during the reveal, but ok.
---
AFK farming on a solo game, here we go again.
---
I cant evan get on the game I have bought it on steam and cant load after playing pre update .....and now bought it on bethesda.net to try get it to work and still no luck
---
Ok cool I'll look for it. I wish they could tell you all the benefits you'll be getting with the mod. I hate that the only way to tell if a mod is better than another mod is by it's cost.
---
isnt a real difference tho
---
Sounds like an issue on your end with the shop. I haven't heard of anyone else having that problem.
---
Yes I did. My build up a camp didn’t give me the one thousand score
---
Well. Bush Wookiee life here I come.
---
Man your gonna to want to group up under builder and keep ur character rested for all the xp you want
---
Meat stew was 5%. It’s not a crafted food item though. See if any crafted meat recipes give XP and see if they are higher than 5%
---
Oh her ice attack? I dont think it’s ever even done damage to me, I’d take her hovering attack any day of the week over that
---
Tldr a bunch of salty people who haven't really given it a chance. Btw you get bonus points for events and like 1k for sbq
---
You guys should be more annoyed at the ammo changer.
---
Yeah. I also don’t see the point in selling the other lower tier variants while selling the best variants at the same time
---
Is it even possible that they could listen to our feedback?
---
lol, ur cough is a surprise mechanic!
---
It's the absolute worst. They do it deliberately, they must hate us. There is no other explanation xD
---
To be honest, the single only item on the entire board that I want is the raider tree cage thing, everything else would just be a bonus to me.
---
At least the ammo converter is a thing now, even if it sucks for what it is.
---
I got the score for it...on PC
---
This should be a PSA at the front page.
---
It is though. This is a multiplayer online RPG. 100%. 
---
It is multiplayer. It is online. It’s an RPG. 
---
It’s not massive. Servers only have 24 people on them.
---
What is your FOV ?  Anyway the point is that we need an alternative to this sort of interface so we can choose between immersion and functionality.
---
dont forget adrenaline is borked.. that little gem isnt getting the attention it deserves...
---
I wish she would stay in range and do that disco lights attack the other SBs do.
---
Hey neato! I gotta see this....
---
I guess you’ve never seen a .38 compared to a .50
---
Started playing eso a couple months ago and it 100% killed FO76 for me. Really thought this season would bring me back but after grinding daily's and weekly's last night I gave up on my plan for trying to get to 100 in the season and switched back to ESO.
---
Yeah you fucking were.
---
True, it'll slow down a bit as it goes on. Bethesda said it should take no more than 2 hours for later ranks but I don't really know how accurate their estimation is on that. But after reaching rank 10 on the first day, I'm expecting I'll be about 15 by the end of the week with the dailies each day. Some of the challenges can be done easier on an alt, as well, like the "level up" ones. Much easier to gain a few quick levels on a new character. I'll be keeping a low level just for that reason. I guess at this point all we can do is hope it doesn't start taking 5000 points per rank or more as it gets further along the little game board, or everyone's progress will slow down significantly. Being able to pay atoms is fine and convenient, but I'm really hoping it doesn't become a requirement.
---
I have been but there has been reports of players not getting it.
---
I would keep track of all the challenges you’ve completed (along with screenshots) then open a ticket with Bethesda support.
---
Did not earn any for the destroy robots challenge
---
i thought a level costs 150 atoms or about USD 1.50. You can get 1500 atoms form all the challenges, so 10 ranks are kind of \*free\*. Lets say you get to level 50, get another 10 discount equals you would have to buy 40 rank = 60 USD. It'is kind of evil of bethesda to really try let say 60 or even 30 bucks every 10 weeks, isn't it?
---
Godzilla had a stroke reading this and fucking died
---
Oh i know i could group up, i just dont really enjoy leeching off other players if that makes any sense
---
Does joining public events with other people count at all?
---
How many hours did you play and how much did you rank? Bethesda announcements are for beginners. Experts will achieve it faster.
---
But I have the feeling that farming the ingredients for "Cranberry relish" is far easier than farming the ingredients for "Tasty squirrel stew". Happy squirrel hunting!
---
One my characters that picked Raiders, when I go toe Wade he dual talks about “we could have used those detonators” with “Finally someone who can help.”  Both dialogs go simultaneously.  So I get hung up and opt out.  I go back to dialog, get hung up again as it isn’t done going through each.  And usually third time I get the daily.  I think what is really happening is the dialog has to both run, when over then I can just get the daily dialog.  My character that picked settlers, never gets this.  This has started since Wastelanders, so I assume it is a known bug.
---
Those things will sell for a fortune, but I suggest you hold on to them as you just won the lottery
---
People have been commenting that they are getting the Score bonus at 3/5 of it completed, so it seems to give it out early for some People.  I hit level 10 yesterday, I had to have gotten the points for all the weeklies
---
Some of the paints for the power armor and weapons look cool. Otherwise don’t know about some of it.
---
It was satirical re the rest of the other guys posts he ignores facts cause they dont fight his weird furry beliefs
---
Ive been pretty much ignoring the legendary run tbh. I dont care about skins or my camp features so the cosmetic stuff doesnt do anything for me. But ive not yet hit endgame on my first char so who knows if that will change.
---
Im a purely solo player though, so a lot of the team-focused stuff is irrelevant for me.
---
I was hoping I’d get to do something new with all the hype about the legendary run.. turns out it’s just doing the same things I’ve been doing the whole time. 
---
Sigh.
---
Well not being funny but if you have mo good input no point comenting I've been up all night trying to sort this and have dislexsia so spellings nkt the best in fist place i just wont my game to work..........
---
Yep
---
It probably got out sourced to someone is who is passionate about the game.
---
Maybe, I have not worked out the math on it yet, all the events are different, in some of them you kill lots of mobs, and others very few mobs, some give lots of XP and others not so much, but you could be right. **If** you are doing events back to back and nothing else it might be a bigger bonus. However, from what I have been observing people are not generally using the Event public team that way. They form them and then go about their business, largely ignoring the minor events and only hitting certain events, like normal. 
---
If you are sitting in an Events public team and you are not using it, then you are losing out on the XP bonus you could have from the Building team. So, this is why I think it is the best option, it frees people up to do whatever they want to do, and still get a bonus to everything they do that generates XP. For example, if you are just sitting in an Events public team and killing super mutants at West Tek, doing your dailies or doing the main/side questlines, well you are losing out. If you are farming acid from snallygaster and crickets sitting in an Events public team instead of a Building team then you are losing XP.  If people are just sitting in the Events public team because popular opinion said it was the best, but they are not using it, then they are losing XP on almost everything they do that generates XP, and they should instead be in the Building public team. 
---
Also, it is all the little XP bonuses that make it a lot of XP. We have potentially a steep level and score grind ahead, and people have limited time to play, so hopefully, I am just providing suggestions on how they can make the best use of that time to get more levels and more score. This game has a ton of ways to get more XP, but people will overlook these buffs and instead complain about the grind.
---
A good game shouldn’t need little ploys like this to keep you playing everyday, a good game should be fun enough to want to keep you playing it everyday plus there should be a reward system easy enough that if you log on enough you should still be able to complete it without needing to play for hours on end everyday. There’s a reason I put cod down and won’t buy another bp. I know it’s not a battle pass I know it’s free but it’s still pretty bad when the entire community is speaking out against it
---
This has nothing to do with "survial". Thats only greedy as f\*\*k. And yeah, it is kind of genious to create a system where you can ripp-off your customers every 10 weeks with a new scam.
---
Im guessing the use of workshops also falls of dramatically as you level, havent tagged on in over 100 levels. Aswell as not paying attention to travel costs as I got so much stuff worth caps aswell as caps in my stash. Might be up to lower levels to report! :)
---
Being on a building team also helps out considerably. More passive XP for everything you do. One my 147 character I leveled up 6 times yesterday just playing the game like normal. That's not counting my other characters. They have perk points sitting there used from before, so I'm not sure how many times I leveled in them. I'm assuming once or twice per, because I normally level at least once a day just doing my routine on them.
---
It didn't take even a day for my excitement about this to turn into frustration. Even if you gain max score every single day, you'll barely get there. That doesn't even factor in the things that will apply to a lot of players like having a full-time job, a family or going away for even just a weekend. When I get home from work, Fallout is supposed to be my entertainment. All the daily currency and rep limits already pressured me into only doing specific dailies and tasks whenever I log in, because I can't just grind it out whenever I want. This season stuff has only made that feeling so much worse.
---
What's the point of getting triggered here?
---
I mentioned this to understand how crazy it is to task novices with this subject, they have a codebase that's over 20 years old and the fact that we've been seeing the same bugs for just as long tells me there is still stuff in it they carry around since back then.
---
Probably structural designs they haven't touched since then, like it always being cell-based prior to Fo76.
---
Funny sidenote: There was an MMO using the "gamebryo engine", they could have invited the former devs to help on the tech side of things, but they didn't AFAIK.
---
I updated the formula to account for the visual rank to avoid confusion. Same numbers though, different way of calculating.
---
There’s a lot of things to do now for a new player. My only advice would be to avoid this sub for as long as possible or you’ll get most of the story spoiled.
---
Yeah I had about 5k worth of ammos that I don’t use so I just got rid of it. Trying to get out of the machine was a hell of itself.  Hopefully trust will be reading our replies and working to update how it works based on our feedback.
---
didnt use bruh as in b ur bro as in BRUH u know, the 2013 meme
---
Yeah, but it's still the best thing in this season.
---
its always the same scam. Learned from mobile games. Off course star is very easy. You first have to get people into sunken time fallacy before turn the screws....
---
I believe I did.  However, I don't remember for certain.  There are quite a few comments on if it rewards SCORE and how much.  I remember seeing that telltale blue bar after completing the SBQ event and I had already completed my daily SCORE quests and most of the weekly ones as well.
---
Sorry, I wish I could be definitive and say exactly how much I earned.
---
Actually a lot has been done. I’ve been playing from the first day of BETA and this game has had a major overhaul since then.
---
Is it where I think it needs to be yet? No. Has there been substantial improvement? Absolutely.
---
Is earning the items stopping you from doing what you WANT to do in the game? I hardly ever take on the event quest I just go about my business scavenging and improving my gear, usually play maybe like 2 or three hours maybe 2 or 3 days a week and I'm still finding my efforts fairly rewarding.
---
its not something new tho.  its the same tasks as before
---
yeah, he's bugged couse when I got close to him he's says that as fast I recover the item better but when I talk to him I don't have the option to talk about the mission
---
Not really leeching off people, most the time your in a group everyone's doing the own thing anyways to try to grind it out, but unless your in a public group theres no extra bonuses, and sometimes people will share there perk cards giving you added damage. If you in an event group just make sure u do all the events or that boost to xp gain is pointless. Was on a server last night were there were 2 other groups both were the event boost ones but I was at every event by myself
---
well i guess the story was never really the biggest aspect to fallout i mean its never going to match something like last of us 1 or something
---
it’s called the cryolator
---
Me either.
---
How many more spots is it without the exp quests?
---
&gt;I say in theory because based on information collected by not only me but several others we based the formulas on the following ~~"true" facts~~ assumptions:
---
fixed it.  
---
We dont know.  We can say facts in any way shape or form when its been a single day.  There is simply not enough data yet to know how this whole thing will progress yet.
---
r/titlegore
---
this is the sweet, that was the sour of the recent patch
---
They added Human NPC’s
---
Or a massive misjudgement of their player base. Not good in either case, and never said it was.
---
All weekly challenges that are X/5 are giving the SCORE reward at 3/5 at the moment.
---
All these people complaining don’t know the struggle of a 400 lb stash weight.
---
Same tasks, no atoms.
---
Think someone worked it out that if each rank increases by 25 score the later ranks would be around just over 3000 per rank. But because you get 150 atoms every 10 ranks so ranks 10 to 90 that's 1350 atoms that you could use to buy the last levels so you wouldn't need that much score. If you aim for rank 90 then buy the last levels with atoms earned you wont have to grind that 3000
---
I got to rank 6 in 2 hours... it doesnt seem like it will take very long. Maybe 20 days  of logging in for a couple hrs... am i missing something?
---
I did wonder that, as I've been getting SCORE bonuses for seemingly nothing.
---
Yes this game costs money. According to the budget planning department at Bethesda, it should cost you about 30-60 USD EVERY 10 weeks. Cheers and suck it.
---
At this time S.C.O.R.E. is only attainable through challenges. Once repeatable challenge is to get 10k xp, so in fact you do get S.C.O.R.E. from XP. Another challenge states doing 5 events in group gives S.C.O.R.E., so technically, the statement is true but misleading.
---
so i get minus points for opposing an opinion, great tha
---
...or how to read the subreddit
---
Yeah, I'll head back to The Division 2, even if it's seasons are crap, but the grind is more fun.
---
And you believe that they had not planned to add them before the game even launched? Ok..
---
Either that or be turned of the game by the constant bitching
---
Can confirm this is having to me. I'm still completing 5/5 to be safe, but no extra score.
---
"not a single thing has been done."
---
someone needs a safe space.
---
I just finished Encryptid 2 minutes ago and I got some.
---
possible the next weekly repeatable will not be XP but public events. This is theory at this point.
---
If you mean the xp repeatable, accounting for the fact you need to level 10 times every week, you should be able to get enough xp through the dailies alone. I’m not certain though. So it should be negligible. You will be able to earn everything if you do absolutely all dailies and weeklies since the xp added will finish the rest, but the leniency for missing a day or two is extremely slim
---
But it’s less satisfying as this new creation
---
Ya I was excited to play this new season thing but I played last night for 2 hours and just felt forced to do a tons of tasks. I was hating after one night, there is no chance I can progress on that track without losing my mind crew that.
---
that logic could be applied to something like gta online which feels exactly like gta v
---
Anyone who played this from BETA can appreciate where the game is at now.
---
I hate it only for one reasons tho(the other parts are amazing) I WAS EXCITED FOR THE NEW END GAME BOSS TO COME OUT IN PATCH 20, SO WHEN IT DID I NUKED THE MINE TO TRIGGER IT, turns out it isn't coming out with the update. Im mad
---
I’m too old to have any clue what you’re talking about. All I know is this is a morpg. Of course it is going to have characteristics of that genre. 
---
Anyway there is still a ton of lore, huge word to explore so I don’t really get a lot of your complaints in the post. Leave the forest if you hate the greenery.
---
They're probably already aware. I highly doubt they toothcomb reddit comments anyway so no worries my dude
---
Happened to me this morning. I waited about 20 seconds and it finally loaded.
---
Sorry please elaborate???
---
You know now that you say that I did recall seeing a completion and thinking what the hey and just kept playing. That’s probably it. Now I feel like such a ghoul for making a post.
---
I can concur with you that this must be the case. I also got the weekly 5/5 events when I only did 4/5. I also got the build up a workshop I got the award at 3/5. Never received any extra for doing events other than the repeatable 10000xp challenge.
---
Didnt the devs literally say it takes about a 1 hr at early ranks and 2hr at higher ranks? Where are you getting these inflated numbers? I think they will cap at 2k per rank
---
You and me both. I at least liked getting wine and dined first, but this was straight surprise skin on skin.
---
10 day old account shitposting, how new and refreshing!
---
Absolutely Not, if youd like to take your time to discover that for yourself then the burden is on thee although Im postive there is a twitch channel.. like every other game studio
---
Those events are for legendary farming. No one cares about finishing quest for those low level rewards. Lvl 100 percpective btw.
---
AFK farming will likely take you too long to get them
---
It's a huge deal but some people are defending it saying it lets Bungie make op weapons without worrying about having to balance them in the future, completely ignoring how that makes no sense for armor and how they are already giving out recycled identical weapons we had before but with a higher level cap instead. Regrinding the weapons you already have is a new low.
---
True! I didn't think about that lol 
---
I forget that bugs only get fixed if they help players. 
---
Speaking of public teams, what do you think? I am in love with it!
---
I just died to that yesterday. I'm not sure if they're patched out fully.
---
Seriously, it’s almost gotten as bad as r/fallout.
---
Just lace his Brahmin milk with vintage nukacola.
---
Good point, then they should redo the interface.
---
I played today and got to like level 8 on the board. I totally think it will be possible to reach 100 before September.
---
I would stay on the left side of the map to start with, play the old main quests up until you need to go to the right hand side of the map, this will be the quests for Rose at the top of the world. Do the new stuff up until you meet the overseer.
---
Once you get to that point just explore the left side fully, learning how the perks system works and picking a build, melee, heavy weapons, stealth sniper etc. 
---
Use https://nukesdragons.com/ to plan out a build, and look around the web to see what other people have done to give you ideas. 
---
Build a house, decorate it, do what you want really. Just don't try to run before you can walk. Don't rush or stress about things too much, just relax and enjoy the exploration and quests slowly. Once you get to the end game, stuff gets a little repetitive.  
---
When you hit 50 do the wastelanders quests and explore the right hand side of the map, which is really meant for higher level players.
---
Have fun, and welcome to Appalachia.
---
&gt;  I’ve been playing from the first day of BETA
---
So have I, which is why I made this post. This subreddit becomes nothing but complaining about Bethesda for a week, then Bethesda says sowwy and suddenly woo Bethesda.
---
Anyone can think what they want, I'm just gonna point out I don't know any game subreddit where a majority of the top posts of all time are complaining about the company.
---
Got to rank 7 in 5 hours I don't know what they are talking about
---
The devs also say they think this is far more valuable than the $50 worth of atoms we could’ve earned on top of the $15 this season gives us. I’m using the numbers we’ve been given. If you’re putting your faith solely in the FAQ then you’ve got a level of trust for Bethesda I simply will never have
---
updated.
---
Now gear has a level cap that makes it unusable a year after it was added into the game, everything except exotics has this. They are also reusing the old weapons with a new cap to pad out the loot pool.
---
thats true, i m looking forward to see how it all goes
---
I can confirm that most took getting to 5/5 to get the score
---
I wanted to observe after all the failing of events and see what people were doing, was almost like a social experiment! Was very entertaining though
---
I like it what little I've played its bringing more people to events that felt empty before. Typically Line In The Sand I usually only have four show up. Last time I had a dozen or more. So I'm hoping to get to do Radation Rumble and Project Paradise.
---
Anyone who has played this game since BETA can see the improvements that have been made. Dont get me wrong there are some issues still but it's far better than those early days. People become to expectant. Anything released gets attacked by the community immediately
---
The dream is to get the plans from that! I’ve got a few with 2 animals remaining but that’s the best so far!
---
The server i was on last night was pretty dead tbh
---
I ended up going the wrong way to where i assumed the pioneer scouts area was and stumbled across the wise mothman event with the lighthouse
---
About half way through a random 3 man team using the new system appeared and started helping out
---
Im just a bit weary of any groups with players who are a much higher level then me, or am i being a bit too cautious and should just group up?
---
i meant why did we need a battle pass or battle royale like most other competitive multiplayer games have nobody asked for them, and as for the map it just feels lack luster compared to fo3 or 4
---
No. The time for the event was reduced a while ago to 10 minutes, no more 30 minutes legendary farming. Probably nobody cares about the level 40 wendigo, most people care about the treasury notes for finishing it, though.
---
Yeah I spent about 5 min with it and then just went and dumped all my spare ammo like I normally do.
---
People just like complaining. I think they need bans tbh
---
other than concord i mean..
---
So event continues for 10 weeks, you completed 1 week mark (10lvl) in 1 day and say its time consuming...
---
tbh right now, even the caps reward is better than this, and i really wish it wasn t like that
---
Try encrypted? There has been postsnkn here of people geyt I ng score from sbq,encryptid and rad rumble. 
---
Ill mess around with sbq tonight.
---
That or its delayed..my character was staring into space and it just flashed up..been that way for 5 min lol
---
Okay, something weird is going on then as some people are getting score and some aren't. Sounds bugged to me.
---
Its a known bug they're investigating but they're also fine with people farming them out if they manage to get them before a fix goes out.
---
That's what they would say in an interview. You don't go to an interview to say "no I have nothing to see with that big shiny new project"
---
I agree completely.
---
I saw this last night as well. On my first login there were no icons at the workshops so i could not fast travel to them. After loggin in again for a second session later in the evening, the workshop icons were there and i could FT to them.
---
Someone I thought said to try going down to see Sage, pop back and see if he resets.  Others redid fast travel.  Not sure if either works
---
Lol pumpkin combat armor is more grind worthy then a majority of the pass rewards
---
I just did 6 or 7 events while in a public group and received no score for it. Did... uranium fever, radiation rumble, bots on parade, dropped connection, path to enlightenment and one or two others.
---
Haha fair enough.
---
Problem is they are shoehorning in extra features on an outdated system.
---
When i first heard of it I though "oh cool, itll be like the ammo workshop, you just have to put in ammo you don't need, and over time it will pop out the ammo you want"
---
Nah......
---
Also i tried seeing if the weeklys were repeatable even when grayed out but i dont think its that..
---
I wish I could disagree but Reddit is very heavy on the Fanboy vs Hater rivalry and often lacks clear and unbiased views.
---
But back on track...i would just play freely for a few days/levels to get the hang of things and not worry about all the different builds, quest lines, events etc. Just have fun and learn the games dynamics.
---
If you think new accounts are just shitposting then no wonder this subreddit can't handle criticism
---
That's good to know! I missed them as was away around that time of year, nice to know it's a-ok to farm
---
&gt;Starfield, elder scrolls comes out I doubt I’ll play this fallout again."
---
I was looking forward to Starfield. But do you really think, given the history of Bethesda, they would take one step aways from such dubious monetizations schemes they are now one? I'am sure, that one of the major reasons Fallout 76 is still being worked on, is that they can experiment with monetization practises to see what best works for there future games.
---
No, this won't be a one-off giant mishap. This is the future of Bethesda. You can't come back from the dark side....
---
There are three platforms that need to be synchronized in the patch release this must prevent fast hot fixes.
---
I like how you put that.  I agree.  I did my usual run last night, had fun, got my rewards, SBQ then bedtime. 
---
How much SCORE were you getting for events?
---
i already did a lot of ft and even restarted the game.
---
I blame the one who purchased an indie group of people to program F76, yes. Why I would blame the developers when they are new to the company? Learn some background shit before speaking.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who feels this way.
---
I would rather they remove this from the game than leave it as is.
---
It's one of the most unintuitive game mechanics I've seen. No logic behind it. I would love to know who created and/or OK'd this implementation...
---
&gt; You just started getting lag and framerate drops? Lucky you! Many of us (most of us?) have had that for at least a year. Which is amazing because no other game I own has that.
---
I... don't believe you. Unless you have like only one other game.
---
Completely weekly for 1000 score 5/5 for killing robots - no score awarded
---
Thing is, if it was a kid's game you could understand it as they have loads of spare time. Look at all the ones on Fortnite. Now I have zero problem with them following the Fortnite model; in fact it's a good thing. But the grind just doesn't take into account an older playerbase with less time on their hands... ALTHOUGH I suppose it means the hard to get skins towards the end will be genuinely rare.
---
Personally I'm not even sure I would want to go back to a single player fallout after this. I enjoy meeting new people  teaming up for events and trading. Going back to single player would have none of that. In my eyes this is a game trying to offer the complete fallout package. Play solo, play as a team do as you please
---
I get the salt but I mean public teams don't make them any money but they were still well implemented.
---
As a rifleman there are only 2 things you need to do. 1. Get your hits in to get a reward. 2. Protect heavy gunners. Your protection of heavy gunners determines how quickly you can get the event done.
---
Is it worth the effort though? Like would you just be better off farming fire floaters?
---
I already didnt play the first day, guess ill just skip this game entirely from now on, this is bullshit.
---
Same on PS4.
---
I agree, daily and weekly challenges should reward you score and atoms
---
I completed all these and more, same here. No rewards.
---
With a Bethesda logo on the front.
---
Have you considered that your math might be wrong? No where does it say that it goes up by 25 indefinitely. As stated in the inside the vault, lower ranks will take roughly one hour where later ranks would take two. My bet is it will cap at 2k per rank and not 200k like you say. I guess time will tell though
---
Just being cautious on xbox iv been giving my teammate weapons and armor that doesnt really suit my build but for them there good weapons. The community is pretty decent for us not to sure about pc, but at the same time we dont the hackers you guys have
---
&gt; Fear of missing out makes me want to not bother starting at all.
---
Exactly, it makes me not to want to play cause i know i cant play every single day.
---
What if it wasn't intended for everyone to get every single item?  I'm starting to think this was the case.
---
people compaing about wanting meaningfull content, not a mindless grind
---
1-100 is still 100 steps mathematically. We only need 99 steps. So with your updated formula we need n=1 to n=99.
---
No they won't make any changes to this season. They want to see how many people end up buying atoms since they can't reach rank 100 otherwise. They will make the needec changes to next season when they have an estimate how many players will buy atoms.
---
Roger that.  Thank you!
---
Good work! I've been trying to help people get started as well!
---
Could you give a link? Or at least a a search query?
---
There is an inclination to complain about everything about this game and people who praise them when they do something right get ridiculed. I'm surprised that some people with the negative diarrhea still play the game when they all complain all day.   
---
    
---
"There is nothing to do" while also saying "The Grind is too hard and long"  
---
"You get less Atoms from Seasons then the old way" while also saying "i have xxxxx number of atoms stashed because there is never anything on the atom shop"   
---
Ive seen persons say both of these sentences on the same post or in different comments under the same post. 
---
I understand that they need to add more content and it´s coming in September and even has some teasers for it now (The new radio waves)    
---
I for one am glad about this system. It gives me something to look forward to, something to work on. I can clearly see the path. Can they do better, absolutely. So why can´t people say that this is in the right direction and then offer constructive criticism on what theyd like to see improved.    
---
I also really like the public teams, and love that it gives buffs. 
---
Bethesda has really had too many mistakes and weird excuses to those mistakes, also sometimes very arrogant. It seems like they are getting better. The fallout 1st announcement time and implementation, the west tek bag thing, the instability of servers, the ban waves that banned a lot of innocent people. It really seems like they don´t get what is wrong. It sometimes feel like they have a hard time understanding the complaints about the game. Or, they are stuck in a limbo between Cinemax and customers.   
---
Bethesda needs to pull their pants up and meet their customers where they are, it seems like there is a big disconnect.   
---
Anyways to summarize, love the changes, it can be better, let´s constructively and positively ask for the changes we want, Bethesda, pull up the big boy pants. Stop acting like you don´t know about issues, not fixing things and address them head on. Only when it hurts your bottom line you fix it immediately "Duping, god mode etc."
---
You're right, I forgot how they added Fallout 1st and the scrapbox after telling players they couldn't increase stash space anymore due to server stability.
---
Or how they removed the only raid
---
Or are you talking about their fixes to voice chat and the addition of text chat
---
Bethesda lies to your face and you cry "sAfE SPaCe"
---
Bruh you're the one in a bubble
---
Nah man, even in raid shadow legends you can skip days and keep your reward streak. This is another level of greed.
---
ROFLMAO!!!!!!
---
Unplugging vendors does not prevent people from buying from them
---
I thought I got nothing after doing weekly challenges,  but I think the credits arrived randomly - maybe halfway through or later I'm not sure as it did appear like I was getting credits randomly. I did assume it was the repeatable xp one, but could have been wrong as I wasn't paying too much attention.
---
However I've just added up how may credits ive meant to have got and itching ive had them as it seems to add up.
---
I hate it so much
---
They are lol stop fuckin crying sooo much.
---
You just got lucky. Sorry.
---
Unplugging your machine doesn't stop people from being able to buy from them.
---
Yeah, completely unusable. I exchanged one time but I would rather spend my gaming sessions playing rather than clicking through menus.
---
it looks like they were going to but got lazy and just slapped a personal terminal next to this cool looking ammo converter machine and called it good
---
Also people would spam them all over to make a trap camp that crashes your console.
---
That I dont no
---
I am of the firm belief that fo76 should be f2p. As for those who bought the game, we should get some of the benefits the people that are subscribed to Fallout First have (movable camp tent, some unique skins, etc). As for current Fallout First players? Give them the promised atom cache-out and maybe some other goodies. Then have Fallout First as a premium service with some actual worthwhile benefit (maybe free fast - travelling + special bonuses with each season + bigger camp limit/storage space).
---
Even then I'm not a big fan of Fallout First being a subscription service - it would feel more appropriate for it to be a one-time purchase of maybe $20-30? They could easily make their revenue if they focused on atoms (store purchases/buying xp to level up/etc.) and potentially having a Season Pass Plus which is an upgrade from the default free pass that would get you more items.
---
It’s such a fucking a chore. That’s all
---
It is now. Everything that has recently been implemented and everything in the near future is going to follow that same pattern.
---
In the other side of the world is winter and i have lot of stuff to do for college. So bassically, if the system doesnt get fixed, i wont be able to get all the rewards as i had planned
---
Everybody is conveniently forgetting that they added a bunch of new lifetime challenges. Not sure if they continue ranking up beyond the first one, but even if they are all solo ranks, you will get quite a few hundred for really simple things off them
---
This isn’t accurate at all. I did three queen runs yesterday, one on a normal server, one with just one other person that I play with, and tried to do one solo. The public one went normal, the one with my friend had both of us on the ground nowhere near anything that would block her path, and the same thing when I tried it solo. All three times, she acted normal and hardly landed, and most of the time she did land she’d go back up right away.
---
Thanks for the update! I need to remember that!
---
I bumped around doing random events in a public team (events) for about 2.5 hours and got 5 levels of score or whatever it is... Was vendor hopping and procrastinating a lot as well so I don't think it'll be that bad
---
Yeah I think that’s the one I’m on about. Thanks for the info!
---
One word: Cryolator
---
Yes, the discussion is aobut missing a day and getting screwd, not how fast you can get levels if you play.
---
Vendors are online whether powered or not - just a slight glitch!
---
The only way to be sure is to store them but it's madness to restock from scratch of you sell dozens of items across multiple stations.
---
Is anyone taking into account the repeatable challenge for just getting a certain amount of XP?
---
I noticed that too.  I don't think I've seen nearly the entire server come over for a SBQ event in the past.  They did last night. It was a lot of fun.
---
People seem to think it's an either or sort of thing - either you acknowledge that the game has progressed quite a bit or you acknowledge nothing fundamental has changed with how Bethesda is and how they communicate.
---
You can do both. Yeah, the game has progressed a fair bit since the early days but we went from an atrocious game at launch to one that's just not great now. Like it's fine but it seems that we can never get through a release cycle without some major bone-headed thing come up.
---
I think the closest we got to general praise was with the launch of Wild Appalachia.
---
The Ammo Converter should BE a vendor who gives you caps. And then you could use those caps to convert the ammo into anything else you'd like. But just remember that it was my idea. It's never existed in any other Fallout game ... EVER! :P
---
Most of the people that quit because of the stash limitations hasn't come back
---
And if I recall correctly everyone is still having stash weight issues according to the daily posts about increasing it. And now Bethesda charges money for near unlimited storage space.
---
Bethesda doesn't care about you and you people are too busy whining about someone criticizing your game to realize it.
---
cause youre dumbdumb.
---
&gt; the discussion is aobut missing a day and getting screwd, not how fast you can get levels if you play.
---
They want money. Over players.
---
Is this factoring in the repeatable daily/Weeklies?
---
Sorry, but this comment just looks really ignorant. This isn't even close to the worst thing happening around this game. And what season passes have you been playing that were not time gated in any way?
---
Of course it doesn't 🙄 and these are probably the players with the best loot smh. Is making them inaccessible via walls or something to much of a burden :P
---
I share aquaboy, because idk why.
---
For sure, cranberry relish is easy, but so far I have found two reliable squirrel spawn locations. I'll explore it some more, but I think it'll be fine either way.
---
Like i said though, missing a day wont screw you. You play for about 20 days out of 10 weeks and somehow your screwed? I think this whole sub is jumping to conclusions way to fast. Wait until someone gets a score rank of at least 25 until we make judgement. 
---
Beth should just outright tell us how much score is needed so the proper math can be done
---
It's safe to say that bethesda sucks at everything now.  Once again, i put my hopes into this pass but it seems it's another fail from them. 
---
No idea how other studios do it, but look at Dead by Daylight. If you want to grind half the thing in one weekend you can do it.
---
The best part is no CM telling us how it works. Nice managing.
---
I'd be cool with 15% honestly.
---
Yeah i did one last night and didn't notice anything but have seen some folks say you get it if you launched the nuke but I can't test right now as I'm not at home.
---
Netflix time!
---
i not talking about that at all. In fact i think it would be good if bethesda added a co op mode in future fallouts, its things like fallout 1st, lack of the feel that other fallout games give off and maybe the bad radio station compared to other fallouts!
---
Boo hoo. He tried to cheat and got fucked for it.
---
Lesson learned hopefully.
---
Gold is locked at 200 per day and not even Jeff Bezos can earn 15 Billion a day ;)
---
Thanks for the warning, i did buy the game on xbox but it would take me too long to catch up if i swapped platforms now
---
And only cheaters ive really encountered is in nuclear winter
---
Got it, thanks for checking. If you have Herd Mentality mutation, you can see SPECIALs going from -1 to +3 by creating a public team
---
I got the new flyboy salute last night it seems to be in the hello area
---
I wonder if they'll tie in with PS+ games this month too.
---
I am almost positive it was one of the weekly challenges triggering even though it's not technically completed yet but who knows at this point.
---
Didn’t catch it. Just saw the bar pop up
---
thought this was going to be about a hot fix for the million things broken things in patch 20...
---
The multiplayer overhaul of their engine was done mainly by veterans of Zenimax. They go into it more in the Noclip documentary.
---
Might be worth adding that if you join a team, make sure that you're not sharing the same card.
---
Just checked again its actually not full screen. But alot bigger and closer than your pic. And default FOV
---
They accidentally had the bush cat and deathclaw for free. You got to keep whatever ones you built after they added prices. This would work the same way I imagine
---
Idk about this. She’s actively targeted me while I’ve been standing on my tent. She’s able to swipe me with her wings no problem.
---
I’ll track what i get today. It could be a mistake they made and they immediately ‘fixed’ it.
---
Bethesda sees this post, adds Dragonrend to F76 in the following update 😋
---
A lot of people asked for both those things actually, neither of which you need to participate in. 
---
I’m surprised you think the map is lackluster compared to 3 and 4. There is way more variety with 6 distinct regions, more areas to explore. Oh well, everyone is entitled to their opinions. Commonwealth just got repetitive IMO.
---
Yes, but a large part of the player base DOES have hordes of ammo, and this has been on the wishlist since Beta.  It can’t be an unforeseen utilization.  And even so, if you JUST used the converter for daily ammo gains, it’s still a terrible and onerous experience to utilize this UI.  
---
I’m just going to keep vending my ammo.  Folks will probably wanna buy it than wait through this process.
---
I JUST noticed another bug, i spawned into a worpd and it doesnt show the workshops on the map, some (poseidon energy plant’s) wprkshop icon is replaced woth the poseidon energy plant yard icon amd location, but it says i can’t travel to an unowned wprkshop
---
Yeah I’ve bought it, it’s very similar so I’m not too bothered!
---
seasons should be biannual
---
All good, and I agree. I was also able to eat meat and still get full when Herbivore was active. But I assume this is because drinking a Serum gives you immunity to the negative effects for 1 hour
---
I was about to say I saw a timer ticking down and it certainly wasn’t the full 30mins.
---
Just straight up not working.  Time to mess around with different cards until we get a hotfix.
---
Hey. We don’t talk about that place.
---
This is not as those numbers vary wildly. Assuming you are doing literally everything daily, specifically leveling up, then you should be able to make it. There still is VERY little room for leniency. You may be able to miss a week in total, though that’s after factoring in that the season may be 11 weeks and not 10. This also doesn’t count score for events as I never was able to earn any so I couldn’t add numbers for that either. A few people say it does work and a lot say it doesn’t. Until we hear from Bethesda or a dataminer, this is the data I had to work with. If you are planning on doing absolutely everything you can 100% earn them before the end. You can MAYBE skip the NW rewards and skate into the end but I’m not sure
---
So just because it's free it's okay to be garbage? That's what you saying? Like 'Oh, look at this sidewalk people can use for free, let's riddle it with spike traps. They gonna love it.'
---
Remember when people defended the season pass? yOu DoNt HaVe To PaY.
---
Ahh so the argument isn't...
---
It's impossible to level up with how much I can earn.
---
But it is instead...
---

---
I love it because it reminds me off the assault rifle from fallout 3 and the service rifle from New vegas....man patrolling Appalachia sure makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
I'm going to have to check this out.
---
There should be a billboard to the effect of "Coming Soon: Sweeping Technological Oppression!"
---
I'm so ready for that BoS update.
---
yeah, i just wish there was more cities or an urban feel to some areas
---
20 atoms! Wooh, hey big spender!

A lot of the weekly ones are giving the score at 3 out of 5. I've had this happen a couple of times but I have git points for everything, including stuff I have no idea what for.
---
I'm surprised at all these posts about how much of a time sink it will be to get all the rewards. I played for a couple hrs last night and made it to level 7. 
---
They threw us a bone with public teams. Join a full team for double XP and run a bunch of events. 
---
Also I'm pretty sure I got additional SCORE just for doing public events. I was actually surprised by how little time/effort it took.
---
As long as people defend Bethesda for not adding Text Chat to an online multiplayer game then I won't say the game has gotten better. I mean look at it like this, Bethesda is literally breaking disability laws in some areas by not doing this, yet I don't see any legal trouble for them. Bethesda advertised discounts in the atom store and players reported not having any until suddenly they started showing up after mass complaints came in. The Fallout 1st tent crashes my game and can't be used, support doesn't respond to me, I paid for a product that wasn't as advertised and the last time I heard from support they told me to buy a new video card, this goes against the FTC Act. Again, no repercussions. 
---
It's like this subreddit has completely forgotten they weren't able to sell anything from vendors for well over a week and they weren't even given an apology for it. Players had items stolen from them and Bethesda played favorites on who could have their items back. 
---
I come to the subreddit nearly every day and today after seeing literally 20 of the same post, I felt the need to remind everyone that Bethesda said over a year ago they would be better about communication with the community. Apparently people don't like have things pointed out. I never said anyone couldn't enjoy the game, I just pointed out Bethesda hasn't changed and never will.
---
I was paying attention, and it was as I described it. After I did another one of the weekly challenges it opened the floodgates and I got all of it.
---
That's how I felt with the Buttressed mods. I just went right to the top with those. Shooting for a full Buttressed Vanguard arms and legs. No need for PA anymore lol.
---
“We call them lifetime challenges because they will take a lifetime to complete”
---
You realize it's 10 weeks, right? Most of the challenges are just through playing. If you're actually playing the game and not going afk every 5 minutes you should be fine.
---
And it has a cap of 5000 so now until I spend some I can’t cash in notes
---
I miss adrenaline 😭
---
Why do that, when we all pay for the privilege?
---
See what I mean 10 down votes for NOT being a little cry baby about somthing that was given to us for free
---
Keep the downvotes coming guy your just proving your a cry baby with every click
---
This is the game's cycle. Hook new players, make them spend some cash on sub and atoms then they realize game has no content and they leave. New players come and repeat the process. 
---
   Don't believe me? Look at how they removed any sort of end-game content and never replaced that. ( survival, adventure pvp, vault raids ,etc)
---
Okay, I'll need to check stuff for myself then and see how it goes. Hopefully over the next few days we can get some sort of clarification as to what is supposed to rewards score, as all public events are supposed to.
---
Well that’s West Virginia for you haha. We have watoga and Charleston but yea they aren’t much.
---
Make sure before you take them to have the perk Starched Genes at level 2 and have it equipped. That prevents you from gaining /losing your mutations, unless you drink the serum directly.
---
Finally a good post, Bethesda really needs to fix this huge mess they have just shat all over the community.
---
I enter events guns a blazing, 
---
on fo1st.
---
How about instead of a converter, they make it an ammo bulk machine and just let us sell bulk ammo to NPC vendors or list it in our own vendors at bulk pricing?
---
Starched Genes lvl 3 perk in Luck. You keep mutations all the time. 
---
Marsupial and Speed demon have very few drawbacks but Class Freak lvl 3 in Luck also mitigates 75% of the negative affects.
---
For me, it’s going to be just like every other battle-pass system I’ve been exposed to:
---
I don’t always play the same game for weeks on end, so I hop off for a bit and I’ll lose out on a bunch of the stuff. Unfortunately I can’t *grind* back this disparity when I’m invested in the game at the time because of timegates and/or piss-poor methods of farming points without the timegates. So the entire system to me is just an overly-exaggerated paid dlc if I actually want anything at the end of the pass.
---
Which is I guess what the devs want: another method of shaking money out of casuals, not actually gameplay.
---
yep!
---
It is summer for exactly 50% of the world mate
---
I was really looking forward to the season thing since it would give me something to do in the game but like everything they do this just sucks
---
it is so awful. I had to spend an hour trying to convert it in menus I kept backing out of and not remembering what I was doing. there are so may choices to sell for points and such a tiny amount at a time, no covert all? 2k point then swap over to spend then swap back to sell, tiny amount after ting amount? no thanks. it wasted my time.
---
I scrapped it and took my ammo to a train station to drop. save me camp budget and time.
---
I don’t thinks it’s all that hard it’s been the first day and I’m rank ten
---
What does game pass means for me as a PS player? What is this?
---
Instead of just fixing the water wheel spinning, they went ahead and made it into a generator as well.
---
That is probably to limit how many mules a player can have
---
Try using explosive weapons until the issue is fixed (explosive weapons still work in vats)
---
Became broken for me after the patch
---
Notice: if you drink the serum directly it has a time limit. Until that timer runs out you will not have negative side effects or lose the mutation. Once the timer runs outs, everything is normal.
---
You should also have more mutations then that, especially ones that will help your build.
---
Currently stuck on ps4 and have not found a trick yet except leave server. The ammo converter  sounds useful but in reality is a complete pain in the ass.
---
i was kind of excited for this thing and was ready to gee at back into the game but after reading about the extreme amount of grinding i'm not sure i can even do it in time due to losing 3.5 entire days a week to work commitments. is there any hope for me at all if i can't play every day?
---
Ahh that ain't so bad
---
as much as I love to take a big healthy dump on bethesda as often as warranted.. that 7600 hour challenge is really just a time tracker
---
We were prepared to eat the loss in exchange rate for functionality.  But we go little functionality for a terrible exchange rate.
---
It's becoming more and more obvious that the goal is to keep everyone grinding, logged on, and in the game as much as possible.
---
Pretty sure the C level bonus is based on that in some way.
---
Out of curiosity, did you factor in the weekly challenges as well?
---
Speed demon is the mutation that increases hunger and thirst.  I highly recommend class feel to reduce the amount of food and water intake
---
Nothing for you. 
---
It’s a separate Microsoft subscription service that lets you play around 100 games “free”. They rotate in and out.
---
Well bulk ammo gives you other things besides just the standard steel, lead, and gunpowder so people would farm them at ridiculous rates (especially if they were to dupe)
---
The UX for its sucks too. My friend couldn’t stop using it because he was caught in a usability loop.
---
Drink them with starched genes off!! THEN you activate S.G. to keep your DNA unchanged
---
They’re using the FOMO model, really messed up man
---
Exactly! Just like the one you get from the Crater but without a cap and you have to put in the ammo you don’t want for it to work.
---
It doesn't stop them from being used but it removes the vendor icon from everyone else's map, making it a whole lot less likely anyone would come to your camp and start looking around for vending machines in the first place.  It's super annoying to go to someone's camp to shop and find out they have them locked up behind doors.
---
If you have time to add a lock to a door just take the extra 2 seconds to delete the wire so people aren't wasting caps to come see your locked up machines. (Not that it's very hard to clip through your door and do my shopping anyways, hopefully you don't lose too many caps if I start buying stuff.  If you want to advertise then I will shop)
---
Small potatoes compared to the 70% reduction in atoms you can earn.
---
My brother paid €70 1 day before they put on a discount, he even asked but they didn’t do bat shit
---
Completing certain events on the server, especially harder events, also rewards score.  This reward is completely separate from the daily/weekly challenges.  People aren't factoring that in.
---
I already own them all though I guess it's good for the people that didn't
---
It’s one of them things the kids call memes brah
---
They want to make sure you have a need to purchase atoms. The cash grab would be fine if it even vaguely seemed like it translated into better content.
---
Bethesda could not introduce a new feature without also introducing a new currency.
---
That worked for me. Thank you sir!
---
Yup, happened to me today, first time I have tried since the update.
---
I hear you there, luckily I only do that for a load of weapons and stuff to scrap for steel. Level 40 legendary stuff isn't all that useful and I don't need any more scrip.
---
It is stupid that only challenges give xp. They shouldve added a vendor that gives you bounties that you complete during your playtime
---
If being in the BETA is criteria for having valid complaints then that explains how some of you act in this sub
---
Especially when I was in the BETA
---
Also the BETA was filled with bugs and issues, comparing it to that would be like comparing the ingredients and the finished product saying "You should have seen it when it was being made, then you'd really appreciate how it looks now"
---
I hate the fact that vendors and displays are connected to stash. Each individual container should have its own weight/item limit, it would make life so much easier and it’s obviously possible since the junk box has no limit.
---
I didn't feel like a chore, I just picked up 5 levels in about 2.5 hours doing random events in a public team
---
memes are funny...
---
Just like the atom shop, or any other video game.
---
It looks like a robot flipping you off with its eyes.
---
Indifferent leaning slightly negative. I'm actually more satisfied with public teams than I am with the score system.
---
In Fallout you have a gun tho??
---
From the responses to this post, it seems that player initiated public events (scorched earth and Encryptid) are the ones that reward SCORE
---
I love the part where everyone at the Game Studio agrees this is a good mechanic, they make it, test it, use it. Ship it. It went through all that and still complete disconnect from player base. As if the PTS was just to patronize us, an attempt to change how we see them
---
Jumped on nuclear winter last night to finish dailey and was rewarded with halloween stuff after first match been grinding it since
---
Actually from my limited time last night I agree with you, ran tea time, project paradise and radiation rumble, the last two without any problems. Made for a nice change of pace actually. It makes all the difference if a few people/everyone there knows what they are doing.
---
I rock 8-9 mutations, including both of those. With speed demon you’ll notice your thirst bar diminishes noticeably faster, but it’s very manageable still.
---
Should have used the one from new Vegas instead
---
Incorrect, sometimes it will but more often than not, it is not lol.
---
And if they don’t tell you the type of item, you have to scroll through all the menus till you find it
---
Do not know if you get score everytime I got 1000 from the sbq but when I did it again I did not.
---
Lone wanderer doesn't not work in the public teams but you get to replace it with strange in numbers and rank obne of something else.
---
I'm gone for a day and everyone is talking about being level 100 why??
---
We don’t have those stats. All we know is 13k people on steam right now. I would imagine PS4 is more but no way to know for sure that I am aware of.
---
... Huh, I just kept spamming enter and cycling through, but now I know I can backspace. Thanks.
---
Did 3 queens and and imposter this morning with full lunchbox benefits. It was awesome. Got a lot of score, levelled up a few times and got to explode things into confetti with a minigun.
---
I'd agree except there are people saying the opposite as well, so something is going on, a timer, a bug, something.
---
Btw what do you normally do to speed level, ive tried rushing the main storyline and just started the pioneer scouts stuff
---
But outside that im not really getting anywhere
---
Any squirrel hunting tips? ;)
---
In 2hrs I finished every daily and all but 1 weekly I very confused how people think this is gonna be hard to do I. That 2hrs I'm already at rank 10 so I keep that pace I'll be done in 20hrs of game play
---
I finished them all lol
---
Yeah usually, a not so recent multiplayer games will have bigger player base on console for some reasons.
---
So you got score from the event completions themselves and not from any other challenges or xp?  How much did you get per event?
---
Yes. Though I don't have it, I know how it works and that's how this should.
---
Tactical Marine Helmet (might now work due to bug. Not sure.), or Chinese Stealth Helmet.
---
You know I copped the Raider/Settler bundle when it was on sale, even asking this reddit for advice.  
---
The discounts do make extra sales for sure, just look at this week's power armor: the more popular black bird armor has a smaller discount than the less popular American paint. They obv know sales bring in more atoms.
---
Omg yes the 4th stuff is insanely gaudy, but to honor how loud &amp; obnoxious I dress in real life I gotta pick up those Hootenanny Overalls. My grandmother used to have a stars &amp; stripes themed guest room so ig we aint that far off.
---
That is exactly how I hoped it would work.  Still being one of the first prizes, I think it is fair to say that people shouldn't expect too much from it.
---
Her back hurts, she can't move. hahaha
---
Legendary Re-role system
---
According to the 24 downvotes, yeah only you
---
Mine fixed after playing borderlands 🤣
---
What do you get for doing all the extra grind?  Some cosmetic enhancements?  A few QOL items?  All the extra grind is not at all necessary if you don't care about those items. You're not required to hit level 100 to enjoy or win the game.
---
Yes we rebuilding the Atlas 👌
---
Oh sorry I didnt know we were all playing on your account.
---
Never knew about this, thank you!
---
I played a fair amount of this game at launch and am still sub here out of curiosity. It seems like almost every post is either about how terrible Bethesda is or how underdeveloped the actual game is. I mean, fuck it's been two entire years. What is the point of holding out that long for a game to be fixed when you can just play something else?
---
It needs to be 1000 score for 10000 XP. Otherwise rank 100 is stupid and unattainable.
---
Just let us scrap ammo into steel lead and gunpowder!
---
That's true tho.
---
I will once I get further into them. I'm mainly a 2 hand melee build now and these two would be essential
---
Yes. Every weekly I have completed has gotten ticked off early.  So actually seeing it to completion doesn't award any score because it's already been paid out. More than likely you have gotten your points, it just doesn't correlate with what the challenge screen is showing you.  Actually completing it is only making it show as complete on the challenge screen.
---
The best protection from waterborn diseases is to not stand in water. Just stay away from the stuff that harms you. The benefits of the shielded ss underarmor greatly outweigh the marine underarmor. Underwater breathing is a useless perk because how often are you really swimming in this game? Build your perk loadout around a certain type of weapon to maximize your killing efficiency. Don't go for some all around survivor, you end up just dying more because you can't kill things fast enough. 
---
Remember: A Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.
---
Lol no effort at all just play normal
---
I have both, but I prefer other tyoe of headwear, I should have mentioned that. I just wish some other under armors offered the same protection. Thanks for replying!
---
Nice trailer. The build a new community thing at the end is intriguing.
---
Also twisted muscles
---
The power armor one is not tradeable
---
I don't understand why it doesn't just use the vendor interface and instead of using caps or scrip or gold, it uses, you know, ammo.
---
I like the game but you have to play intentionally for it to not be a chore
---
I'm having the same problem too.  Hoping it's a bug.
---
I keep giving them more chances and they keep failing. I love the game but I’m seriously disappointed in this and am not motivated to continue whatsoever.
---
There is no such thing in this game. If you are talking about purveyor, then read the comment i made, that you commented on, again.
---
strange in number is awesome. i can jump so high in my PA haha
---
Shes been stuck on the floor of her original bunker with a bad back for me, she bugged and I cant interact with her past that.
---
Okay. I may or may not have gotten 250 SCORE points for Scorched Earth.
---
To people like me who are level 100+ heres what he is basically saying
---
MAKE IT EASIER TO BEAT IT WITHOUT PUTTING IN WORK AND DOING ALL THE DAILYS AND THE EVENTS IN THE GAME
---
The power armour one isn't, the old man winter man one is though.
---
if you do not have... 6 pts in luck, when you find them at a reasonable price, suggest buying a 2nd copy of any mutation serum as backup.
---
Why:
---
  I run 4 luck.  To use super duper3 when crafting, I have to unequip starched genes2.  More than once, I have forgotten to re-equip SG2, then popped a radaway.  Bye-bye mutations.  Then trying to hunt one down at a reasonale cost...
---
Having a second serum on hand mitigates that.
---
Ya but when will the new end game boss come out, im more excited to see him then anything else, his rewards are already in build area of your camp, like the plushy, but again when will we be able to start the event
---
I'll nuke whitespring on a private and kill the ghouls log off rinse and repeat, not sure if it works on pc or not tho, other then that I run events by myself,
---
Nope just saying that I have it better then you guys lol
---
He doesn’t know how to use the three seashells. 😆
---
I will say I’ve never had any experience with hacking and almost no grieving on PS4.
---
Play on PC for the frame rate, mods and more buttons at you're disposal. Plus it's just easier with Discord and Spotify because the in game music gets old real fast.
---
I didn't check the amounts but did check where the repeatable was at to see if that's what did it. Definitely got score from scorched earth and encrytid upon completion.
---
PogChamp!! Okay thats cool to know.  I wonder if the trigger is launching it yourself then.  That's so weird lol.  How come no score for being the one to start encryptid for everyone xD
---
Bethesda: Damned, they ran the numbers!
---
I feel cheated by this system. Before we at least got atoms. Now its like they hired a  behavioral psychologist and made this skinner box thingie from hell. Not happy at all.
---
The game has always been laggy about the popup displays like quest completion or showing the legendary you picked up.  If you do stuff like complete a quest and immediately open the map and fast travel away, it can be very delayed (minutes later).
---
You could also just not grind challenges and  and other things and just be happy when you happen to get the reward. I also avoid the quests which besides Wastelanders are mostly boring. The fun I have in the game relies on Events, building up my CAMP, and grinding legendaries. Though I have a lot of different ways and areas to farm legendaries do it doesn’t get boring
---
Well, it is Appalachia, after all.... After the Fallout so to speak.  I haven't seen any functional bath tubs in my time playing through... Just some rad showers.
---
Herbivore only buffs food, not special effects from food. For example, gourd soup provides 20% food with herbivore, instead of the regular 10% without. Perception bonus stays at +2 regardless of the perk... unless some food is glitched.
---
I'm not even doing it to be safe, I just want it to be completed on the challenge screen.  
---
Kind of sucks right now though because I have a few left that I'm not even close to having done but I am 99 percent sure one of them already triggered this morning and I have no idea which one it was.
---
There are still bugs they haven't fixed since launch, if not beta.
---
Well yeah, aside from QA, they're too busy slaving away on content for you.
---
You can say that again
---
Exactly! It’s like they think we only have like 200 ammo. Many endgame players (myself included) run with upwards of 20k ammo and several thousands unused types. The devs who don’t play the game are probably level 5 so it works fine for them but for the actual players it’s a piece of garbage.
---
Probably if you somehow to gain all the rewards before the season ends they'll likely re-enable atoms.
---
I dont understand the issue. I have the converter and love it...got 12k 50 cal from it and 6k 2mmEC. Is your main issue that you use a terminal....how does that differ from the ammo maker from the raiders.
---
https://youtu.be/qSzfAWPhodo
---
It just changed in this update, perhaps unintentionally. Here’s video proof.
---
Lois\*
---
Massive misjudgments of their playerbase is a time honored Bethesda tradition.
---
*Continuously mumbles obscenities under his breath* 
---
"You Are Fined 1 Credit For A Violation Of The Verbal Morality Statute."
---
No the argument is, i cant earn the only content in the patch because i have a life, a job and other shit to do.
---
Must have been hanging out in my game instead of yours then because he never left mine! Glad to see he made it back to you!
---
I almost made a very big mistake, thank you. I got these 2 mutation serums for 500 caps each
---
I am actually swimming quite a lot, believe it or not XD. Wheather it is taking shortcuts, or just jumping around without giving it much thought. Staying away from water  would actually affect my play style. I am not at all about max efficiency, more about enjoying my game sessions. I have a simple rifle build and I manage to kill most things fast, or at least fast enough for me.
---
I probably will keep the wetsuit, unless I find some workaround, even if it means less protection and damage overall. Thanks for taking the time, I appreciate it!
---
Search the sub before posting.
---
I've also noticed that if you're mashing/spamming the button, you actually can trigger the conversion twice in a row each time you hit the menu to trade in the ammo.
---
I feel this! I was so excited to unlock it, and it's just a smidge above useless.
---
I keep hearing the excuse "but now we're getting other rewards" but we can't *choose* those rewards.
---
&gt; It seems like almost every post is either about how terrible Bethesda is or how underdeveloped the actual game is.
---
But have you noticed how much push back this thread has? Really weird for there to be all these posts about one specific issue that gets upvoted but anyone blaming Bethesda as a whole is discredited because...?
---
&gt;What is the point of holding out that long for a game to be fixed when you can just play something else?
---
People like me who spent $60 at launch trying to hold on to a glimmer of hope or people who spend any amount and want to feel justified paying for it. Like when Fallout 1st  originally came out everyone lost their mind and was furious. Now you basically have people here advertising that you'll need it eventually because they bought the year long instead of the monthly.
---
I just wish people would realize Bethesda has admitted they have been in the wrong and has done nothing to make up for it. If companies were cartoon characters then Bethesda would be the South Park Sorry Guy.
---
Damn.  Thanks for your response. They took it off the crafting menu so i didnt know if it was still tied to your character
---
It's not the reaching level 100 that people are angry about,... It the fact that they have to actually do dailys now and events and they also want to earn some quick karma for who ever the fuck knows why
---
I mean, I don't think it's evil but it's lame if you don't wanna spend that much money. 
---
Just remember, this isn't food. It's video game jewelry.
---
In a couple weeks we'll get a whole new flood of posts about the crappy ammo converter once the new players see how it works. And more pics of teddy bears in sexy positions that we've known about since launch day.
---
If this was in the PTS it would’ve gotten shut down right away, but nooo for some stupid reason we can’t test seasons in the PTS
---
I personally disagree as I do not use the food perk cards because i have all my cards for the way I play. So i bought the fridge. For that reason
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out.
---
that's the end game for FO76
---
Uninstalled: achievement unlocked
---
thats a function of how the update DLs on your console..
---
patch is like between 4-11 gigs depending on platform
---
I guess I have a one up on you then... Being a student and all
---
No they’re not.
---
Chore list 76
---
Wait, what? 
---
My update was 3.3GB, what platform are you on?
---
Honestly why would anyone want to buy more ranks after the ammo converter interface experience.  Expecting anything quality coming from seasons rank died with my remaining will to play for anything after rank 5.
---
Backpacks
---
Very weird. Best of luck!
---
Most likely patch 21 next month
---
I'm sorry, I'll play this game for you. Not for me. Do you want my Venmo info to send me money each month for Fallout 1st?
---
Sounds like you're installing the entire game.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Also worth note, in case you were wondering, the jetpack takes no fuel of any sort, just AP.
---
Hold up.... What?
---
I play on ps4 and was only somewhere around 11 Gb
---
based on the in game tutorial that says only doing challenges I'm going to say if you  did get any S.C.O.R.E. from events, good for you I'm jealous. Unless the people getting it are the ones the actually launched the nuke/started the event?
---
If you want to destroy assorted robots go to the Whitespring there are sentry bots, assaultrons, Mr. handys, protectrons and turrets
---
Scroll and look for the green "FREE" tag.
---
Nah man, i own a company and i have money to waste, dont feel too superior lol.
---
Apparently they intended for it to be a low level untradeable useless piece of crap and it was never meant to be in the crafting window.
---
People's math seems to forget that some challenges, like the weekly Gain 10000 Exp, are repeatable.
---
They said each rank will take 1 to 2 hours i played for probably 3 and hit rank 7. I completely every weekly and most dailies. It doesnt feel like it's gonna be THAT rough.
---
Only took about 3 months.
---
I have never seen another PlayStation game update have such massive downloads. Most of the 76 updates even are nowhere near this large.
---
I get the sense that you need to step away from the game and reddit for a bit. Just a gut feeling.
---
I guess this is a lost battle then GG
---
i don't think there's any hope for me at all - i lose three and a bit entire days due to work each week (three 14 hour night shifts in a row, no time to do anything other than eat and sleep between them) and after looking at the post about this i don't think it's physically possible for me to complete the season.
---
it's a shame but i'm not even going to try. i was hoping it would be something new and exciting to do in the game but it's just the daily/weekly challenge system given a new coat of paint and dumbed down.
---
Kinda, yeah xD.
---
The weekly goals only respawn four times a month. The daily ones are worth significantly less. 
---
You won't be able to earn that many points every day.
---
PS4. I played the game not a week ago, usually updates are between 3-10gbs, no idea what’s going on here.
---
Apparently it’s ripped off from fallout 4
---
Sshh!
---
Lol try the new CoD we get 30gig updates pretty much weekly (if we are. Lucky they are that small)
---
How would you know when your account is only 10 days old??
---
It’s listed in downloads as an update file.
---
Also it looks like Scorched Earth and Encryptid are rewarding decent score points for some people too, on top of the repeatable XP.
---
but
---
&gt; we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.
---
Wait, the ammo converter is bad? You would never guess that by reading this sub....
---
PS4 too, that’s what most updates usually are.
---
What the hell is NW?
---
Keep in mind the weeklies gave you much of that xp. Those you cannot do for another 6 days now. 
---
Now it’ll probably be more slow progress with the dailies only. And ofc the repeatable
---
It seems like a running total but Halloween and Christmas rewards are unlocking at different times with the same XP required. With no way to track, it’s hard to say. I just know I’m getting the Halloween rewards first, and the Christmas reward comes a few matches after.
---
It's not peer pressure, It's customer feedback. That is what any company worth its salt (Bethesda may or may not be in that category haha) should be listening to in the first place.
---
So the partial completions are showing as completed but I think if you really fully complete it it will award you the points without announcing it. At least that’s what I saw when it happened to me.
---
If you have unlimited storage and still place items in a vendor from which you can't make money then you clearly have your own unique set of problems and I will just slowly back away.
---
And it *also* also looks like all public events are supposed to award SCORE points but so far it is only those two due to a bug.
---
The only line in the sand event I did yesterday was bugged. The scorch would spawn mid air around the sonic thing you’re supposed to protect. Had a nice kill box with 15 or more players. Looting the gut piles took awhile.
---
&gt; PS4: 1.3.2.9 (11.2 GB)
---
per the patch notes..
---
I wasn't even paying attention tbh. Seemed like every few minutes that blue bar kept going up. Took me a while to figure out the XP part of the score, too. I was confused that it seemed like the number was all over the place, but I guess I just turned over 10k a few times. My server kept spawning gulpers and super mutants at the workshops so it was a good day for XP.
---
That's the complete file size of the game.  It starts there, and then once installation begins, it finds out what it needs and doesnt need and then goes from there.  If there were 68 gig updates, the file size would be too big to handle at this point.
---
Nw doesn’t even load for me, so that’s just points I’m never going to get, I doubt anyone will get to lvl 100
---
I dunno, it doesnt feel that bad. Maybe I'll have to give it another go today. I will be disappointed if I do need to play every day.
---
They had to do something. Why anyone would buy Atoms previously is beyond me. I have no problem selling cosmetics to people who want to pay real money for them.
---
Probably, but again, it’s still not entirely clear. It was a messy Queen.
---
I just logged off, but will get back on after the dailies reset, since I’m just about to level up.
---
Game devs have access to console commands and probably use them to have ammo anythme they want to. They don't have to grind
---

Complete nonsense. You could just aim to hit rank 90 then the atoms you have gained up to that point would allow you to purchase the remaining ranks without need for a credit card. Its doable. It wont be easy but can be done. If this could have been done quickly you would all moan that there was nothing to do in a few weeks. Make your minds up
---
MW/warzone has like 20-40 Gn updates every like two weeks on PS4 lmao but also maybe it’s just you cause my update was like 9 or 10
---
i sold my acc today
---
Strange indeed, I know consoles need more space for updates but it shouldn't be anywhere near that much.
---
Doing the math actually makes it suck more. Those 10 levels feel good, but about 7-8 are for weekly challenges, which means the rest leaves about 2k per day. 
---
As you level, each step goes up 25 points, so it's assumed that while 1-2 is 1,000 points, 99-100 will be 3,500.  Therefore, your last week of the season will get you 2 levels for the weekly and about half a level per day. That's why everyone is pissed.
---
I was excited for this, until yesterday. First i learned that it would take less time to farm mats and make my own ammo than use the converter (and i'd get exp and maybe a legendary or two on top of it). Then i actually tried to progress.   
---
Yeah, i'm a filthy casual, but i played for three hours and got 1.5 ranks. The only things i care that much for are the glowy star and planet walls, which are like rank 25 or something, and the planetarium, which is at 100. L-lol. Not going to happen. (Besides, if the "projection" lamps are any indication, the planetarium will work exactly twice in the entire lifetime of the game.) It just feels icky having a couple of cosmetics i'd like behind HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay, and i'm still not guaranteed to achieve it even if i had the time to try. (Not to mention some of the goals are vague... Like, what does "build up" a work shop mean exactly?) So it kinda puts me off from playing at all.  
---
This is one time i hope they piss everyone off and put that stuff in the Atom Shop the week after the season is over.
---
Why would it be downloading the entire game when it’s already downloaded?
---
I did avoid getting the drop site in the nuke zone because I also picked up that its the best place to fight SBQ. As I said before the fact that no one showed up is astounding because of the way I set it up.
---
Have you tried using it in power armor yet?  I get a nice view of the terminals stand instead of the screen making it super convenient to see the insides.
---
Which is the very reason why it seemed to vanish when we need it the most. There is this 'Bethesda is Unaware'  dialogue that gets thrown around. I believe they are very aware that their choices stink of greed.
---
Ok thanks, got it. Just you said "both consoles and PC", so i thought there is something for PS too
---
Yeah I have a feeling lots of them are bugged atm.
---
My feedback: taking away atoms is a blatant cash grab. Reducing new rewards to nothing more than checking boxes rather than introducing new quests and content is lazy and uninspired, especially when so many of these “premium cosmetics” have clipping, collision, are non-working, or include wrong or missing items. That said, public teams are great but literally everything about the seasons needs to be re-examined
---
I think your math is off. The total score required was something like 220725, or something like that (going off memory).
---
Your score deficit just on challenges only is something in the ballpark of 5k, not 12k. You need to do the repeatable XP ones 53 times to get yourself to Rank 100.
---
You might want to recheck your figures.
---
Near the end there’s the only T-65 skin that doesn’t change the PA completely and a T-65 icon
---
It's such a disappointment that my bullets in my vendor sell out straight away, thank you gatling gauss users for putting all of the caps on pocket
---
" I should of stayed at work " ahahahah
---
What if I want store cosmetics? Cant I buy cosmetics with my hard earned atoms from challenges? Og wait...
---
dont shoot the messenger..
---
Is it me or has VATS accuracy gone down? It feels like I need to be much closer to an enemy to get 50% chance of a headshot with my shotgun. I can't think of what else might have changed this.
---
And scrapping them counts toward any scrapping challenges for those materials.
---
Yeah at first I was like we have till September or whenever. That’s plenty of time. Then I played yesterday and realized the amount of grind. 😅😢
---
It's unusual aye, if there are plenty of high levels on the server it's usually pretty busy.
---
Im not sure man. They should definitely implement public events into the score system or atleast be more clear about it. It would help people who only get 1-2 hour max a day to play get close to rank 100. Especially at 1000 score for the harder events.
---
100 SCORE for 10k XP is repeatable this week. If it remains repeatable, that’s a consistent method to gain more SCORE. 
---
Public Events are supposed to grant SCORE. This is stated by Bethesda but seems to be working well intermittently right now.  Once fixed, that is another consistent method to gain score. 
---
We’ve had this system live for about 24 hours. I recommend saving the ‘doom &amp; gloom’ until we’ve had a bit more time. 
---
Bringing it to Bethesda’s attention is good. Panicking about it is not.
---
He’s shy
---
Oh cool. I just thought it looked cool and went with my power armor. But i lost it. So thank you again. Prolly will delete this soon
---
It’s stupid and tedious though because the devs don’t play the game
---
When considering an asset I Hope they test it. Not because they need ammo but to see if it is an easy to use and logical implementation
---
Lol you’re not the one getting downvoted, I’m just sharing what I’m seeing.
---
if its like that, then it is. i hate pvp and wont start NW because of some cosmetics, proud rank 0 overseer here. i will play as i like, but have a look at the challenges and do the doables or what ever mood im in.   
---
but, imho, i think there will be a cap somewhere. i cant believe they made it that tight. we will see.
---
I miss the 50-60 free daily atoms. Will probably switch to steam launcher now that I don’t have to worry about having atoms on separate platforms.
---
Someone actually tested this and thought this worked. This idea was "good" to someone in their studio.
---
So most the glitch exploits that existed allowing you to get large amounts of scrip or break mama vending required you to bounce between container types quickly, since this is a world object you place that allows a player to move quickly on their own lag camp and exploit easy, I'm assuming this is also why Beckett still can't be used as a proper npc vendor.
---
The game has to be making a profit somewhere. Not everything can be done for free like u
---
You want it. So let's be real your actually bithing about not being able to buy cosmetics
---
Blight soup now gives 50% more crit damage with SiN.
---
Bye
---
If you look at the preview photos for that sink, you can see a clean toilet next to it.  I'm guessing the clean toilet is planned after all.
---
Because it doesn't know that it only needs the new files until it checks.  Basically the updater is wierd to look at.  
---
The idea is that IF the game is NOT installed, it can install the whole thing, but as it progresses in the initial  phases, it finds that "hey, the game is here where it says it should be, and look, items A - H are already installed, so I'll start at I and go from there."  
---
This leftover bit is the update.  And anything the fails validation is downloaded and replaced.
---
We had difficult group content but it got removed.  I imagine if we ever get anything like vault 94 again people will once again complain it's too difficult and it'll get removed or nerfed.  This game caters heavy to casuals.  The average player can't even figure out how project paradise works so difficult group progression content is probably not in the near-future.
---
Doesn't seem to be all events. I just completed:
---
Jail Break, Radiation Rumble, Path to Enlightenment, Lode Baring and Tea Time
---
and was awarded zero SCORE points.
---
EDIT: This was on PS4
---
So that’s why it took longer to down the SBQ....
---
I get your point with that, and everyone always says something like that when games implement NEW systems. The problem is this system replaced our old method of earnings, which was atoms. So if I don't complete the season, it's an overall nerf to my earnings because the lower tier stuff, such as copies of 1 skin to each set armor (which I would never buy with atoms), aren't worth anything to me. The thing with atoms is they roll over and can be used with some choice. If I earn only half my atoms for the day, they still have value. If I only complete half a season, it's pretty much worthless unless they put good rewards at the beginning.
---
I would love it if someone in your team travels to an event if a message would pop up, “so and so is at event bots on parade, press ESC to fast travel there”
---
This is an excellent summary. I didn't think I'd get out of the terminal the first time I used the damn thing. It's slow, counterintuitive, and pretty much more trouble than it's worth. I guess I just have another odd C.A.M.P. decoration.
---
Lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate.
---
The dorkiest possible shit you could incentivize players with in a FALLOUT game
---
Just get a helmet that prevents both airborne and waterborne diseases then use a better underarmor. Get Marsupial and a jetpack and just jump and fly over water. Unless you're into roleplaying Michael Phelps in the wasteland I guess.
---
How much did you get out of it?
---
Yup, as you said - people don't pay attention to the timers ticking down (or at all), the new limit requires almost constant 'noise' to make it in time. 
---
You will get shot, puke emotes galore and rants in area chat about beeing a noob/asshole if you dare to repair/turn on the box or play an instrument... I usually avoid the event now.
---
Also with the armor rating theres diminishing returns for having a higher rating an example, let's say a enemy does 200 damage and your armor rating is 200 you would negate 50% damage from said enemie at 500 you would negate 63% of damage and at 2000 you would negate 73% of that damage. So a full set of vanguards would be less beneficial then a mixed set of hunters, ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, troubleshooter, exterminator, theres another 1 I just cant remember the name. However keep in mind that major gutsys have a 100% armor piercing so if you were a full set of troubleshooters u would negate 75% of there damage this set combined with troubleshooters would make encrypted pretty easy for u
---
This is just a guess, but try setting the ini to read only, if it isnt already, if its already read only, disable that, edit it, then re-enable it.
---
So... if I start all this now, I won't be able to reach 100? I am so confused with the mixed messages.
---
For only 1000 atoms...
---
Nah taking a serum directly still gives it with Starched genes on, it prevents random ones from other radiation though.
---
I’ll give that a try, thanks
---
Gives 12 with party boy lol.
---
200 USD
---
Issue was actually that I had a system update that needed to be installed, did that and the update switched to 9gbs.
---
It’s a shame that’s happened! Hopefully you’ll find some decent people to play along with.
---
Collecting outfits. Fashion week 76
---
Even then, I wouldn’t use this terribly designed item.  If I had spent time to set through my horde of ammo, that I held in hope of this thing, I’d be loath to keep using it.  Tedium is not a functional gameplay loop.  My ammo’s going back in my vending machines.
---
There is no endgame. Bethesda doesn't know how to design anything other than joyless grinds, so that's all there is. I quit this game about a month ago but still keep up with the news in case a miracle happens, but honestly there are so many better games to play.
---
So I don’t play daily and realistically can only play three days a week because of work. 
---
Basically impossible to finish it. Thanks Bethesda.
---
I’m sure the patch notes said he would be sat behind a desk?! I found him glitching between the bunk beds as per.. !
---
Only a madman would play on pc if he had the option the hacks will ruin your whole experience
---
Lol okay
---
It was one of the main things I'd been looking forward to unlocking, but I didn't think it was possible to screw it up this bad. I was wrong.
---
But your not actually just grinding XP for this though are you as you get XP by just generally playing anyway so how much of that repratable would be a grind
---
| how are you 100+ players so bad at the easier events?  
---
It may not be that we are bad, it may be that (some of us) are trying to let the lower level players get the XP etc from killing critters.
---
  Most every weapon I carry will one hit anything in a forest side event; rather than be labeled the butthead for one shotting stuff, I try to let lower levels get hits first.
---
Odd fucking bless your comment. I keep getting mixed messages that make me not want to start the scoreboard, at all. This is more confusing than it needs to be.
---
I literally did not know adrenaline wasn't working until you posted it.  Now I'm  😭 as well.
---
I'm level eleven as of last night with very little effort
---
Hum... I bought atoms, like 6 times and 1 year of Fallout 1st.... what is that about making money? If they want me to spend more on the atom shop release cool shit I actually want to buy everyweek.... instead of one bundle per month.
---
I agree, you will definitely get less weekly challenges, but you can still do the major events like scorched earth and encryptid for 1k score ea. plus all the daily challenges give about 1250 score points all together, thats over 3k per day not including weekly.
---
So they want us to spend atoms to progress.. hmm..
---
I run a bloodied build and unfortunately have no BE weapon otherwise I would try that.
---
Y'all people need Jesus  :´)
---
Exactly. Grouping up in the event public team got me to a pretty good rank in a few hours. It's the first day of the season, I think people are getting to wound up by pure speculation.
---
If no one legitimately gets rank 100 this season (not buying) because they missed 4 challenges, then I'm all for a shitstorm - but come on its day 1.
---
jetpack hyper thrust has been a thing for a little while, where in laggy areas you would be able to fly to the moon. mostly in SBQ events, and the most recent version of fasnacht
---
I don't know if it's new or not, but my 3* pump action in vats pretty much one shots everything... I logged on this morning and it's been killing anything that moves, I'm only lvl 43
---
but it's not realistically difficult.
---
Most, if not all, battle passes are complete-able well within their allotted times just by completing all the daily challenges.
---
Someone did the math doing all the dailies and weeklies for this still will not give you enough S.C.O.R.E.  
---
a season pass is supposed to be fun and a cool thing to work towards while playing the rest of the game. Not "oh my god, I have to spend all the time I can play this, just grinding it out because for some reason Bethesda is obsessed with unrealistic grind."
---
From what I can gather it just functions as a bonus for completing all dailies  
---
\*EDIT\* You just get 250 score, same as the other dailies iirc.
---
They'll never patch it. They're more concerned with turning this game into a cash grab mobile game.
---
Exactly.  I can do my fellow players a better service by selling my stockpile for caps.  We all can get what we want with a better UI.
---
But in that respect you can just play the music for that particular event. I see your point though but these 100s were hungry for them kills. I’m only imagining the 10k exp season 100 points pushing that
---
Hey, where was the sink in the build menu? I couldn't find it last night, but I didn't have a ton of time to look, either.
---
That's funny, the other day I was trying to help a kid and his first comment was " you sound old".
---
It's slightly harder if you've got work/school outside of playing. 
---
A good portion of us (probably) are people with lives outside of the game. Bills to pay, money to make, learning, working, etc. 
---
Nobody has unlimited free time unless they're mooching off of their parents just to play 76.
---
There aren't any end game raids or anything atm no, since they removed the vault raid. 
---
Currently the end game is dailies for treasury notes and scrip, exploring, public events, silo runs &amp; sbq fights, roleplaying, rare outfit and weapon collecting, etc.
---
I for one hope they add some truly hard optional content to the end game, with new high level areas or dungeons at some point.
---
So.im right your bitching about not being able to buy cosmetics not completing the board. I stated the game has to make profit I buy first and I'll use the board atoms for the last boost if it seems it wont be possible to do. The game wont be able to continue being supported unless they have a consistent revenue stream  it cant be completely free you must realise that
---
Honestly this patch apart from the ammo converters it really kinda saved the game for me atleast. I have never seen so many people consistently doing events nonstop and it was right 
---
I hope it doesn’t slow down
---
I have a camp built in the middle of the lake in toxic valley and the fast travel point is in the water.  Literally everytime I would fast travel there I'd get parasites.  The marine wetsuit was a godsend.
---
at first i thought to myself, "damn, wont be able to sell 5.56 anymore" but then i actually got one at my base and saw what a piece of crap it was lmaaaooooo XD
---
What is the legendary run? *oh, name of the season I guess ...?
---
Why would anyone buy someone else's account? The best part of the game is starting out at level 2. It's the late part that sucks.
---
So that means you can play every single Day?
---
Yeah it's this, at first I thought it meant the normal daily quests, but it just means do the other 4 daily challenges in the gold star section.
---
I don't pay for Fallout 1st. I'm not giving this game any money. Stop bitching that other players aren't spending their time looking out for you. If I want to log off, I'll log off. I don't need to check if someone is shopping or not. How the hell are we supposed to know that someone is in a loading screen on their way to our camp?
---
Expectation is rank 100. Its doable
---
right? rather than just logging on for an hour and then logging back off
---
They don’t expect you to play everyday ? Lol just because there are daily doesn’t mean you have to log on daily 
---
What they expect you to do now is be more actively playing when you decided to log on
---
thats the "old way"  In that they used to stay in their own areas of the building.
---
Several patches ago, they started swarming/en mass attacks as soon as you hit the door.
---
now it seems its back to the old way.
---
mostly for all the stuff i had junk and weapons etc
---
I do agree with this. There should be easier ways to earn SCORE.  The xp requirement seems to be pretty high.
---
bitching on reddit...
---
"Can't finish the Season? We have these lovely Atoms we can sell you to help you on your journey." probably said by some Bethesda exec.
---
Lemme just edit the word "always" out of there lol.
---
I haven't had issues the few times I looked for it but I'm not surprised that's not always the case.
---
Now this i can get behind. A constructive non whiny complaint about a bug. Not something over dramatized and trying to be smart about finding the most funny way to trash Bethesda.
---
"...in this day and age..." 
---
Bethesda only lives in the monetization of this day and age lmao
---
My problem is that I prepared around 100 cranberry relishes and 100 brain fungus soups before the start of the season that should have helped me grinding XP. Now I wish I would have stocked up on squirrel stew and scorch beast brains instead.
---
So i have two options:
---
1) switch to Herbivore, which means I need serums for all my mutations as I need first to get rid of Carnivore with Radaway
---
2) go squirrel / scorch beast hunting
---
I think I will try option 2 first. I already noticed that there are some guaranteed squirrel spawns in Whitesprings when I was going for the Sentry bots (gave me with buffs yesterday 1700 XP each) and some Ghouls.
---
Fireproof or dense mod protects from SB shouts.
---
Dying to melee from ghouls and unarmed scorched is just a perk of the bloodied build. Serendipity is your best hope, but otherwise just stash your junk and plan to die occasionally. Max damage is the main goal for bloodied, IMO.
---
Stay hidden as much as possible to stack damage multipliers like covert operative, and use luck perks to get the most crits. My favorite commando gun is just an AA FFR 25 combat rifle, although I'd prefer a bloodied version of that obviously. It's very efficient in VATS, but terrible in PVP due to recoil.
---
This was also my experience - after completing all my dailies and weeklies, no more SCORE except every time I hit 10000XP (on PS4)
---
between this and the screaming eagle skin id say season 1 is off to a fantastic start
---
Yeah it's a pain in the ass when you have a ton of ammo stockpiled and I don't plan on relying on it as a main source of ammo. I started with thousands of rounds of .38, 10mm, and fusion cells this morning and was done in about 15ish minutes. Shouldn't be too bad going forward if I just make it a habit to convert any ammo I don't use each time I visit my camp though.
---
we need to see how hard it's gonna be in the later levels
---
I mean we didnt know anything about 4 until it was relatively close. And just because people who think NV is perfect didn like 4 doesnt mean theirs whiplash from it lol; I think they know what they did in that game
---
After knowing I was going to be disappointed I was more disappointed lol. 
---
I'm worn out on grinding in this game I might need a break. The ammo converter did me in just placing that in my camp was a grind. I have so many items I acquired through the Atomic shop I can't display due to the camp budget? my camp isn't even big...
---
One of the biggest disappointments was having to deal with the fast travel bug after "Patch 20" where I thought we were having a lot of fixes. One of the highlights was the SS under armor and the shielded mod! that was a nice addition. I agree with OP I'm done with these chores, I will probably not continue on this daily score grind...
---
Neither does tenderizer
---
It’s not anyone’s fault but bethesda’s. Honestly it makes it even worst if it is not in the same spot for everyone, even if it is in the wrong spot lol
---
I will upvote this every time I see it! #bushwookies
---
It was difficult for me to even find a group. I know there are sub reddits and discord’s to look for groups but that was too much for me. With the new group system in place, I think vault 94 would be more popular.
---
That’s the thing.  There isn’t a traditional mode for BP gain and not everyone has multiple characters and a lot of time to grind. 
---
That’s what makes it different than games like Apex and how their battlepass works,  you can get in on the last week and still finish it, and dedicated players can finish it in the first two.  But being able to complete it regardless of when you join seems to be an oversight with the devs on the topic.  They seem to cater to everyone that wants to spend nearly every day grinding for hours.
---
Have you disabled vsync?
---
just quit playing this money hungry game. lvl 200 here and I'm done hoping for good and they only bring bullshit.
---
You don't have to grind to play this game unless you want pointless cosmetic stuff.   I started playing a few months ago and just finished the main story - I have really enjoyed it.  More than any game I've played recently.  I never really felt like any of it was grindy compared to most MMOs, but I didn't really care about cap or scrip farming.  I never had 3-star legendary gear and never needed it - - that's one thing I think should be improved.  PvE outside of a nuke zone is way too easy and by the time you get a decent build going, there is no tension in any of the PvE combat.  I'm guessing people are doing Bloodied / Junkie builds just for SBQ?  Because I have no idea why you would need to put that much effort into a map where 99% of the enemies can be headshot or double-tapped.
---
They’re needed. Bethesda fucked up big time, and this is no where near a first time occurrence.
---
Support ticket page states that some challenges are awarding the points when you hit 3/5 requirements instead of 5/5. I noticed that's what is happening to me when I add up all the points and compare it to my rank.  
---
Looking at my score, I'm 600 points into rank 6 (6225 total points) and all my challenges have awarded 5750, so I have extra most likely due to public events I did the other day.  
---
Total up your current rank and progress and total up your challenge payouts and see if they are close.
---
I consistently got Smiley on Saturday’s but wasn’t able to this week and tried last night and well he basically told me to piss off. So what’s the bug?  When does the gold become available again?
---
Agreed. I am underwhelmed...or non-whelmed.
---
I've also seen them hitting with 3/5 done. The robot one and the camp buildup one.
---
Should’ve been fixed 1+ year ago
---
Completely agreed, I didn't bother saying so in the post though since numerous posts about that aspect of it have already been made.
---
As long as can get to 76 I’ll be satisfied, although I REALLY want that fireplace door
---
I get what you're saying and yes the overall possible atoms you can earn was nerfed.  And yes it was replaced with stuff of equal or greater value but I also realize this means nothing if you do not like what is being offered.  
---
However, lets leave that point alone for a second.  Yes if you miss a day or don't complete every challenge you will not complete the pass without paying.  However, I don't think  1 to 2 hours every day is unreasonable if you are a hardcore player.   I was able to tackle all of the dailies and weeklies in less than an hour.   This leaves remaining time for grinding xp.  So yeah, if you want everything, it's going to take a small commitment of doing your challenges every day.  I'm totally fine with this because all of the rewards are cosmetic and no one NEEDS to have them all.  Plus, if everyone has all of the same cosmetics then nothing is special or unique anymore.  
---
I think it boils down to: Do you like what is being offered in the pass?  This is subjective and I don't think everyone is going to be happy with any particular season.  I think they knew for awhile that they were giving away too many free atoms.  This was a change that was made because it was best for business and I don't think they are wrong even if it sucks for the players who liked earning atoms and having that choice.
---
No I can not play every single day. But even then it's still doable. Seeing people say you need to repeat XP so many times etc isnt really correct because if you generally play the game you will get XP anyway so you wont have to grind 100000 xp slot of that will come through your normal gameplay. Once they have sorted out the level of score we should get from public events that will be another stream to utilize. You have the option to use all board earned atoms  to buy the last 10 ranks. Loads of options around but people are moaning 24 hours into it. 
---
Do you expect them not to have a revenue stream and keep the game completely free and easy to appease people?
---
I think you'll find that you received the 1k for some of the weeklies upon completing the 3rd task out of 5, as opposed to receiving it at the end of it. This is what is causing confusion with people who think they are receiving 1k for doing scorched earth when really its just one of their challenges popping early.
---
Watch out for that camp wendigo and all the damn bugs.
---
Netflix and wookie. I have a feeling you won't be alone.
---
If it did, that's a bug.  You *should* be getting 1000 from the challenge, not the event.  Not that bugs are uncommon around here, mind you...
---
I didn’t get build up a camp score or the gather building supplies score either. I lost 2k score
---
I’m not getting any score from public events.
---
Now someone do the math on how many posts we are going to have about doing the math.
---
Why am I being down voted for saying rank 100 is doable
---
Thanks Obama
---
I had them trigger early.  Robots when I was 4/5 and one other.  Check the math on your score, 1000, 1025, 1050, etc for each level.
---
Well talk in September.
---
Well your math is wrong lol. Level 1 is zero. Level 2 is 1000. Level 100 is 3450 for a total of 220,750 score. 
---
You can get a total of 215,000 score from daily and weekly challenges. That leaves 5,750 to get from xp and public events (assuming they properly reward score)
---
Me thinks they didn't really want people to actually use it.
---
Yeah but look at any online/MMO style game and they're all the same. Log on for the repeatable content to grind currencies. I've been playing MMOs and online games for 17 years and nothing has really changed at their core. They all eventually funnel you into this routine. Now they're just adding ways for you to bypass it with real money. Just like a mobile game.
---
You would think right
---
It be $150 to go from rank 1 to rank 100 
---
The rank buy out starts in 2 weeks (according to what they said when announced) you have to buy each rank at 150 atoms. So if you get rank 50 by the end of the 2 weeks from rank 50 to rank 100 it be $75 @ 150 atoms 
---
Keep in mind this is an option thing.. your not being force to do it
---
Yea some events you do but some you don’t, I know encrypted and the queen does
---
I did. I’m supposed to get 1k score for each one. My piece on the board hasn’t moved and. Nothing has shown as me getting the score for it
---
True.   I've always tried to do something at any event, even if it is something as simple as play instruments.   I gotta contribute one way or another....
---
The way seasons work may well change the way people act at events - we shall see :)
---
Yyyyyuuuuuup!
---
Oh definitely, the business aspect of the game has really upset things. The thing that stood out to me around launch was them selling outfits from Fallout 4 on the Atom Shop (a few *were* in the DLCs), &amp; just having bounced over from that game, it stuck with me. I do think it has improved, with sale items &amp; honestly that is our best case scenario for the current gaming circumstances.
---
I do think it should be optional, or they should at least bring survival back as a mode for those who do appreciate it. I do enjoy the eating/drinking system but when I'm building a camp for 1.5 hours, having the top left corner repeatedly tell me I'm suffering will not be missed. Buffs for doing things is always nice too instead of debuffs for not.
---
&gt;as patrolling the Commonwealth and exploring the Mojave last night and it got me thinking, fallout 76 is just not fallout. I don't know if its the location of west Virginia with a lack of cities or the constant addition of fortnite like things like battle pass, challenges battle royale etc, but it feels like a grind and more of some mmo/ competetive game like most games in the industry and not like a game where i can log on and explore the wasteland with my companion, discover lore, worry about ammo and scavenge and just relax. Bethesda are a good company and they have gone in the wrong direction for fallout 76 and its a shame as we are not getting another fallout it looks like for a while. I hate the grind and the non - fallout experience this game delivers and miss what we are all here for. Boy i cannot wait for mods to come out.
---
This!
---
Carnivore and I’d guess herbivore are giving boost of double to food effected by those buffs, and this seems to stack with strange in numbers.
---
However since it wasn’t addressed by a hot fix, I’m guessing this is intentional.
---
Yeah well I think they just make sure it works. Not interested in how we like it or not
---
My complaint is with the interface not the shitty ratio. Who's the sadist who developed the interface?!
---
Nuclear winter
---
So, this breaks down to: *’Until Bethesda adds this one specific feature I refuse to acknowledge anything positive they’ve done at all.’*
---
That’s a very limited and extremely biased viewpoint. 
---
You complain about ‘fan bois’, but you’re on the other extreme end of the spectrum: **Bethesda bad until they do the only thing I’m demanding.**
---
That toxic bias damages any validity of your argument.
---
I have been playing since beta. My opinion also matters
---
Did both of those last night and they were both busy and full of people that knew what to do. Quietly optimistic that events will be more fun going forward.
---
Game has changed drastically to the point I have friends asking me if they should buy it, everyone here just comes to complain pretty much like every subreddit, they changed legendary perks to listen to the community and all of a sudden “ BUT THEY SAID UPDATE 20 LEGENDARY PERKS THEY LIED REE” shit gets old I can’t even start with all the people complaining about the season pass
---
Oh. Oops.  I'm new to the jetpack since getting back into the game.
---
I gotta be honest, I hope it doesn't get fixed.  I thought it was pretty funny, hurtling past scorched and watching them flock to me like "Where the hell is he going?"
---
No clue.  Same question why is my keep your expectations low for one prize being down voted?
---
I did gather building supplies and build up a camp. Neither  one gave me any score but I did get atoms
---
I mean, it *could*, in theory.  But if anyone was willing to take that bet, I'd put my house and car on it not getting *easier* to progress when you hit the next chapter.
---
People value money differently that just how life works 
---
You can spend $20 on Groceries to buy a dinner or you can go spend $15 on Chinese food
---
Yeah it sucks. fortunately there's not a ton on the board I'm just dying to have.
---
Too much math. Got dick stuck in ammo converter.
---
That’s not true. You are not rewarded score for completing any events
---
He never said you had to play since BETA to have a valid opinion. He said that someone that has played since BETA should be aware of the changes that have been made. And anyone that is denying the existence of the positive changes is demonstrating extreme toxic bias.
---
Nice of you! Yeah, the Negative diarrhea on here is sometimes way to much.
---
Thanks. I get that it’s an option also. You did answer me that the higher you get in rank, the less (relatively speaking) you have to pay for completion.
---
Sneaky and I agree.
---
Probably because the general consensus is if you’re being optimistic, then you’re a fanboy. So have an upvote from me!
---
How did you get the salute? People told me the raider waster bundle but it’s not listed there... I was gonna get the bundle just for the salute but if the salute was removed...
---
Lemme know what Bethesda support says in your ticket about the emote, cause this emote is giving off weird “Not supposed to be available yet” vibes.
---
If I had a scrip for every time someone posted this since launch, I could put the purveyor out of business.
---
I'll start with the fact that I don't care about the hate going to Bethesda, I like most of their games and so on, but this doesn't mean I have to accept everything they implement(this was easily disregarded in SP projects because of the mods that let you customize your play style).
---
So next, you're saying that I can get items worth hundreds of atoms and whatnot, but earlier I was collecting to say about 500 sometimes close to 1k (if including the challenges in other categories than daily and weekly) atoms a month playing between 1 to 10h a day when had the luxury to do so, and then I could buy a piece or a full set of skins that fit my tastes, and not random things that I most likely will never use(though the resources are a great reward).
---
About the resources needed to maintain the game, I never said they should not implement ways to burn money, but they should not implement them in a way that will make the game another job, this game has already enough limitations as is. Though why not implement all the promised things to F1'st membership, it would increase the number of people who would sign to it, don't you think so?
---
About the collection of limited time events stuff, I didn't care about these because it was like a short holiday party that soon will be gone, while the seasons are here to stay, and should not be a thing to throw your time in, but rather a fun addition to your game experience.
---
I must be doing something wrong with my hobby.
---
Everyone complaining how broken it was so they removed it most likely to rework the whole thing.
---
you’re a new account most likely trying to start shit on the sub by acting like everyone praises Bethesda on every post here if you don’t like it than just leave, especially since you’ve been here since the beta and nothing’s changed why are you here
---
They need to fix that piss poor ammo converter implementation. Feel like a lot of chatter in the comments on the sub is actually praising this patch. I’ve loved seeing people doing more events and actually using the public teams feature.
---
Please do a good job with the new boss. PLEAASE
---
Move your camp device and it  changes the spawn point.
---
Theres sometime a delay in the reward giving from daileys this may be the cause of some thinking the got awarded the xp from it imma experiment today with it
---
Yea I’m not planning buying rank til the end of the reason so I can catch up but I’m also planning on actively playing the game and unlocking stuff
---
It´s not there for me either - PS4
---
I just did project paradise and got fuc-
---
 I mean no score, no score
---
Im forever having this same issue,I tried putting a door on my Dome that my vendors were in but players could jump into the dome before it had spawned completely.
---
I didn't want to store my vendor as that's a drag and this was the only way i found to stop unwanted buyers.
---
The fix Im happy with was the seedy shed.I have separate power supply inside the shed that is easy to disconnect (so no vendor icon on the map) then I place a door that you cant see in ,covered the windows with signs and haven't had a problem since.
---
I also placed the shed far enough away from the spawn point to make it that much harder for anyone to get in.
---
It actually depends on your level man, I’m level 212 and it takes me soooo much longer to level up, it’s not all the same for everyone, I used to be able to level up 5 times with 2 west tek runs now I have to do 5 west tek runs to level up
---
In the RobCo Research Facility, when you head downstairs and the M/F toilets are to your left, if you turn around and look at the single wall panel between the stairs and the toilets it is open to the void with added screen tearing and a kaleidoscope/infinite mirror look to it. Trippy as hell. I didn't notice this before Patch 20
---
I'm just saying you have unlimited storage and then get big mad when someone says to check your camp before logging because I might be purchasing something from one of the vendors you needlessly set up. This has also happened in between purchases I already made at one of their vendors. Believe it or not, I understand that sometimes loading screens are the issue but more often it's in between purchases.
---
I saw a vid by Angry Turtle that showed the new massive bonus to XP gain you can get going Herbivore w/cranberry relish and brain fungus soup.
---
I'm going to stock up this evening.  The bonuses were huge.
---
I hear it's once a week from when you first buy from him which for me was Saturday nights. I also heard that he globally resets on Sundays. I miss one week of buying from him and now he glitches.
---
Was this on XBOX? I led one over after an Event last night! Was carnage!
---
I thought it would be like a stash box mechanic where you just add in your unwanted ammo and pick the ammo type you want instead. Then come back later to see how much you got.
---
They seem to design the game based off the freaks that spend hours everyday playing, and that’s probably hurting the game more than anything.  I feel like the bullion/scrip/rep grind was already a scary indicator of where the game was going.  
---
Also the developers had a ton of oversights when designing things for this update.  What about people joining in the last two weeks wanting to complete it?  Any good game would have a way to keep it possible. but the only solution for Bethesda at that point seems to be money.
---
Do you have a large friends list?
---
Yea, I know, but I've come too far and the build is complex.
---
My end-game content is playing another game.
---
It's fun when it doesn't bug in the opposite direction.  Sometimes it will cause you to hover about 10MM off the ground and drain your AP constantly with no way to stop it once it starts.  Usually have to wait for your AP to completely run out......but that doesn't always stop it either.  It will just keep draining and prevent AP from ever filling back up.
---
But there's a tumbler on the left side!
---
Well that’s to be expected, they’re trying to make it so that the challenges aren’t difficult, but you need to play every day. All of those challenges I couldve completed through my normal play, I’m currently at tier 8 (haven’t played today yet), and it wasn’t too extraneous.
---
The ammo maker actually works. I never have to worry about 5.56 ammo anymore.
---
No it doesn't, I've done it over 5 times and never received 1000 a time.
---
In Fortnite, when you do the "daily" challenges for 14k XP, they are immediately replaced with more challenges, they only give 1.4k XP but you can grind as long as you want and still make some progress.  Plus, you get XP from many, many things you do as a normal part of every game, every time you do them, no matter how much XP you already got this day or this week.
---
FO76's attempt at it is a whole new level.
---
I don't think anyone really has an issue with the machine itself, but the clunky interface, unless you have hours to waste spamming menus, its not even worth using.
---
Anytime you and I agree on something, that’s rare and usually indicates that the opposing position is way too extreme and disconnected from any reality.
---
At first I was like, “Why is my grocery store involved with Fallout?”.
---
If you want to get to rank 100, you have to unless you want to spend Atoms. If you miss out on on a day's challenges, there is no way to make those SCORE points up the next day by playing more actively.
---
Never had any issues with hackers. I can't speak for N.W though. Never played it
---
Lol, I think a 'probably' isn't required. Wait until they leave all the quality of life shit for the higher levels.
---
It depends. On most trading boards Xbox seems to be most popular, followed by PS4 and then PC. 
---
Now that's obviously not a great metric to base it on, but it's something, and it does make sense given hacks on PC are muuuch more numerous but also mainly contained to NW sans Hacked Weapons in Adventure mode.
---
There complaining about a season pass that's been out 24 hours. Once the score is sorted on public events be plenty of score streams available to get it. Should be lucky there not being charged for it full stop
---
How do you even spend atoms on it? I’ve looked but can’t anywhere to even do that.
---
It's also a matter of are the rewards worth anywhere near that much effort
---
I feel like the new grind with Wastelanders was already a warning for things like this.  Shame we didn’t  really care in the long run.
---
So true
---
Well that fucking sucks, thats probably why the outerworlds wasnt as good as originally thought
---
I usually go with Tenderizer or Bloody Mess! Let’s get them damage numbers up!
---
&gt; just click convert and then the back button
---
This is the piece I think most people, including myself, missed.  Still not a great way to handle it, but a whole lot better than what looks like the intended method.
---
But hey! I leveled from 1 to 4 in 3 hours so the rest must be just as easy!!       /s
---
Wow you guys love to complain lmao 
---
Most of the dailies you get by just playing the game.. just trace it and play the game , you will earn the reward. Unless your role playing for hours...
---
It’s ok!
---
There’s just been a lot of math posts and people talking about the grind for casual players and there’s just so much we don’t know yet, but the posts seem to be causing some panic.  
---
I just think we should give it a week and see, I won’t be surprised if some of the truly hardcore will get to chapter 2 of it simply from grinding out XP and we’ll have a better idea soon.  
---
Then we can all freak out
---
I read that you can pay X number of atoms per level. I won't be doing it.
---
The unlimited storage is only for crafting materials. Even if I'm at my camp before I log off, how do I know someone is actually shopping at my vendor just because they're standing in front of it? The game doesn't tell me anything unless you make a purchase. You could be afk or taking a photo for all I know. If real life calls and I need to log off, my priorities will always override a stranger's in game. Sounds like you're the only one hear with the big mad.
---
Yeah I played the game at launch and I got back into it a month ago, very much improved. Still needs a lot of work but it’s at least playable now
---
It was already on the pts and everyone seemed to like it a lot, but they didn’t push it through because they wanted to work on it some more.
---
Every other season pass in gaming is progressed by XP earned.  This one only allows you to progress by only doing challenges which are a handful daily.  So you can only progress so much each day unless you play 20 hours a day for your measly 10k per 100 points and that's beyond slow.  So open up your ignorant fucking eyes. 🤡
---
oh boy! i get to play fallout 76 as a job! boy oh boy! /s
---
yeah knew there was a catch when the first 2 rank ups i did had increased numbers, they do this crap all the time in mmo's with reputation grinds, and its not fun there either.
---
How long is the reason ? 100 day long
---
I don’t really care for seasons but the implementation is fine IMO. There are some cool rewards i am happy to grind out. I don’t think I will grind future seasons as much though.
---
You are not supposed to be able to kill the SBQ in 45 seconds. Magic guns are broken and that is likely not working as intended and frankly is kind of a dick move on public servers since that is supposed to be a group event.
---
It wasn't the best and brightest, it was every random person they could find. We never actually left the vault, we're still hooked up to a machine that's running simulations in our sleep. This is vault 112 pre-beta,
---
Free seasons and expansions all you gotta do is play the game and maybe buy some atoms. Already people are posting lies about the season pass about how you have to play every day to get level 100, Jesus I tested out public groups event hopping and played maybe 2 hours and am rank 9 or 10 can’t remember. If public events give 500/1000 depending on difficulty or just what type next thing you’ll see is “ I maxed the seasons out and now I have nothing to do farming events this game sucks”
---
This honestly makes me feel scammed since they advertised it as free and as an option you could pay money to rank up instantly. It’s false advertising since you have to pay to get all rewards
---
Correct moan if too hard moan if too easy
---
I shit in my wheelbarrow then use it to make my razorgrain grow
---
Razorgrain sure tastes like shit though
---
I keep forgetting this too (including yesterday) - thanks for the reminder!
---
I already bought the game, I have no interest in spending additional money on microtransactions.
---
Can anyone ID the song? Wanna add to my 76 playlist
---
What point are you making?
---
You don't earn score for doing events, you get 100 score points every 10000 XP earned. So if the event XP gives you 1000 xp and you need 500 xp to reach 10000 will grant you the 100 score. You can keep track on the challenge in the weekly section.
---
It’s probably because Bethesda has realized that anything that has a transfer menu can be used to dupe. Take that menu away, and you take the problem away with it.
---
Getting the 500/1000 points per public event made it fine for me, just seeing this sub reddit go to a frenzy of incorrect info and bashing almost immediately gets old fast, I just like it because I can hop on do a public group makes some new friends and play
---
For the most part, I'm happy but what really pisses me off is that they broke my favourite gun. The seasons and the new public team is well executed except for a few hiccups here and there with the ammo converter (I'm an ultracite ammo user, so this doesn't bother me).
---
i don't have any friends, but i found the fix, disabled vsynch, thanks
---
I preordered the game. I played the BETA, rushed home from travelling from work just to catch the last couple hours of the BETA. 
---
Now I'm stuck in a depression loop of wanting to play the game but cant bring myself to. 
---
Every patch the notes go up and the unadvertised grind for it is discovered. Every patch I tell myself "this is the one that Bethesda finally listened to the community". Every time they manage to disapoint and I can't help see the game in a negative light.
---
I want to enjoy the game, Beth just makes it really hard to want to try.
---
Why is it bad?
---
Fuck, I'm supposed to make a point? I thought this was just a S Tier CJ, My Badddd
---
as it should be
---
I'm not doing other modes.
---
You need to recover our medical supplies!
---
What? Do you always make no sense?
---
Please add: CAMP related bugs - vanilla world objects reappearing and clipping through camp
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj1c77/camp\_bug\_vanilla\_world\_objects\_reappearing\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj1c77/camp_bug_vanilla_world_objects_reappearing_and/)
---
Edit: Nevermind, I just realized that this is technically included in number 12.
---
I think the point is that we don’t know.  We don’t know if the weekly repeatable will stay the same, say they change it next week to completing events, that’s going to be much easier than XP and people will likely be able to knock out weeklies worth of XP fast.
---

---
That would be the magic BB loads. There are several legendary weapon perks that cause higher damage. Some believe that each pelt is hitting with the total possible damage plus any modifier. I believe there are eight or so pellets so that is a rather healthy increase in firepower. Shotguns finally get some respect.
---
Totally agree, though it does seem people are having mixed results with public events. I wasn’t able to test for myself last night when I played.
---
I think they need to start implementing player groups (like guilds) that can wage war against each other and have bases.
---
They need to start focusing on allow us to create our own content through roleplay. Im with you, the grind is pretty easy to avoid but after either end game there is little else unless you can find a group that will take you
---
CP2077 Good
---
Inb4 they start selling "ammo point kits" in the atomic shop
---
Wondering if you can display your pee sac in your camp?
---
Haven't updated yet. Looks like they will update at 17:00 GMT
---
What's the song in the trailer? I must know!
---
Then don’t chase the carrot.  That’s what I did.  I play fo76 to play. 
---
The best thing I did was give up rep grind.  I also never chased atoms in this game.  
---
I play enough to were I get some atoms and challenges completed just by mindlessly playing the game my way.
---
Just gets old I honestly think about leaving this sub and going to filthy casuals lol
---
Same here. I used to play fortnite when it was actually a fun game (pre season 8) and the battlepass challenges were just horrible to do. They began making challenges that were near on impossible to complete and in order to finish the battlepass you had to do them. This was before epic decided to make your level the equivalent to your battlepass level. It just became such a chore to go on like every day just to do some terrible challenges for 5 battlepass point things and I fear that this is what fallout 76 is becoming
---
I haven't tried the converter yet but honestly if you're just looking the scrap ammo and are online fore several hours at a time what I do is sell .38 .45 gamma cells and other ammo that I don't want for like 1 to 2 caps per and usually make 300-400 caps at a time
---
Don’t hate the tumbler. It’s the only thing that works on that steaming hot pile of nuclear waste.
---
Colossal Problem isn’t live yet, it’s coming in a later patch
---
event was delayed along with legendary perks
---
I actually think it is bound to change in some way.  They're not stupid, despite what some people may say around here.  They know how much bad will this and the ammo machine are generating, and they've shown before that they will rectify things if there's enough noise made about them.
---
i knew i wasnt going crazy! the screen text is yellowish and was for me last night. on my screen today its green text on the terminal
---
I made all my calculations based on your comment about casual playstyle and 1 hour a day. If you are playing 10 hours a day, you would lose from "free atoms" transitioning to seasons. But then you are by no means playing casually and you should really consider supporting a game you seem to enjoy so much. That could mean buying atoms casually, or investing in a 1st subscription. 
---
Bottom-line:
---
If you are playing 1 hour a day, seasons is all good. Accept the free stuff and do not worry about grinding as you do not have the time for it.  
---
If you are playing 10 hours a day, you should put your money where your mouth is and support your main game. Buy some atoms to get things you like here and there, or subscribe to 1st even for a month. You will get a stashbox and a decent amount of atoms.
---
I dislike strange in Numbers, makes marsupial jumping really iffy :/
---
I have this is same issue - it is really annoying.
---
That's good to know. i was unlocking both at the same time until the 10mm pistol and the christmas tree. then, i unlocked the minigun skin but not the rifle one, thought they might've patched the christmas rewards already.
---
Glad they're aren't any Halloween CAMP items, because I really can't be assed to play NW.
---
Lol. Imagine being this biased. Fallout 1st is completely optional, thank the people who buy it because we get free dlc because of the people buying atoms and 1st. This radio station is one if the best, NVs had what felt like 4 songs repeating. This one has soo many and features some great onss
---
Bethesda games are never bugged 🙄
---
Excited for a 2nd endgame boss, does anyone who tried the PTS know if there's a limit to how many can join the event?
---
This isn't about the challenge.
---
Which gun got broken?  I’m wondering if something of mine was broke too and I just didn’t notice yet.
---
I didn't realize you could get it from events
---
thanks a lot. I knew about legendary perks but i though colossal problems was going live now as well.. thanks for clearing this up! Cheers!
---
If players stop cheating by spawn glitching Items in one place the Server wouldn't have such a hard time keeping up with us .....The Devs. Need to play find thoses said players and Ban them ..maybe then the Server wont crash so much Just a Thought
---
Suppressor, tenderizer, First aid, sneak or Action boy. Depending on what i See others use
---
What was your fav gun that broke? And seasons and public groups are fun it’s like a pug dungeon group lol, get a team of randoms one maxed out power armor other wearing a dress using a death tambo and smashing out events. And I was worried about the converter because I saw all the complaints, but it wasn’t that bad. Only thing the game really needs is group shared exp even its only 50% exp unless you hit the enemy.
---
You heard 'em folks, let the hate flow through you!
---
So do you want new players or not? I have no idea what you are saying.
---
My gunslinger is ready.
---
That is true. I think you have made a very valid point. I am one of the younger people on this game and I don't get to go on my xbox much but when i do, I find myself making lists so I can get a few things done before I come off. I'm only allowed on once or twice a week so I need to prioritize my time as well as I can. Also about the mythical/legendary skin thing, I also agree. Back when I played fortnite, just before the end of a season, you'd see everyone in a lobby walking around in the tier 100 skin which was fine but it isnt really a legendary skin when everyone has it
---
PS4?
---
Scrap them and learn the mods. There isn’t that many.
---
I’m thinking each event has a like “ difficulty “ that rewards it I haven’t been able to test trying the same event twice since I was only on a couple hours. But if I can run public events for a day and get like 50k points I’ll be fine playing every weekend ( got a 7 month old so no time for this guy lol )
---
Yeah I know. That's what the 53 times deficit thing is about. That has to be picked up somewhere.
---
Anyhow, the point was more the OP's math is off.
---
Was using an outside grill myself for a placeholder for a sink.
---
Yea i have no clue if any other events give any, i assume project paradise probably does but ive never completed that one.  Also i have no clue if that repeats every day or if that is a weekly as well. I will test and report back later today.
---
Oh, The player vendor economy would be fire.
---
Exactly. I think going up to tier 50 would have been better, this way, more casual people can continue to play as casuals and still get challenges done and not be forced into grinding 24/7 for some trashy rewards
---
I paid atoms for a busted up sink, now they giving out clean ones like Nino Brown on thanksgiving. I’d like to speak to a manager.
---
Bethesda has been ass. Instead of fixing things they simply cover them up and distract us with more atomic shop bullshit.
---
Ah, this is a good thought. If that is the case and the terminal stops that, why can't they atleast give us an option to input our ammo amount or something else similarly intuitive?
---
Also check Player Vendors. The Prime Plans drop from the Xmas Gifts, which were duped en masse. You'll have a really good chance of finding them cheap.
---
It rewards 250 for each rank, so 5 times total for 1250. That's why a lot of people are confused about having 1000 score more than expected.
---
I dont think you understood advice above. You can move your camp device without moving your camp and this changes your spawn point. You dont have to change your camp build at all. Hopefully that helps!
---
I'd be happy with the traditional MMO gameplay.  You level up.  You run the base level group content for gear.  You use that gear to be able to effectively run the next level of group content, etc.  Here you level up and there's a grind for the good gear but there's no content to put the gear to use so you just end up doing the exact same things you did while leveling.  Honestly right now trying to build more interesting CAMPs seems to be my endgame.
---
I actually wouldn’t mind that cause I do that all the time with Fortnite, I jump to like level 25 or something just because I won’t have enough time to finish of their season. Yes I sound a common consumer.
---
Its not up to bethesda, its up to Sony and Microsoft. And generally Sony hasnt been willing to play ball with other platforms with crossplay. If anything, maybe Xbox/PC crossplay would be easier to get
---
I have a 2 year old and 4 month old. My time is numbered as well lol.
---
I knew some bughesda fanboy would find some angle to tunnelvision and defend this travesty again.
---
its currently tedious as all hell.  
---
why cant I just dump X shotgun shells in a bin attached to the unit. go into the console and say "process Shells"? it could even take them in 12 shell batches and give the points back, leaving any remainder left.  
---
that way I can dump thousands of rounds in and it just batches them all.
---
No thanks.  I like my xbox gameplay without MIRV-miniguns and orbital strike 50 cals
---
The Chinese Stealth Suit provides the same disease protection while including RAD resist and armor. I keep it on my quick select wheel and routinely throw mine on whenever I get the UI warning while in around water.
---
Not always. I've tried and I still spawn in random spots inside and outside my camp. I never spawn near the camp device ever.
---
Amazingly, I'm having the opposite effect. Whatever changes were made, my shotguns are doing less damage, and missing about 70% of the time in VATS. I've just stopped bothering using VATS altogether, since I'm missing 3 straight 95% hits in a row on enemies both large and small. Never had that issue prior to Update 20.
---
Sarcasm is strong in this one
---
R u serious? Bethesda have introduced two new currencies, both capped &amp; no further game play &amp; you are calling it the “best update yet”? 
---
They have plastered another layer of lipstick on the pig &amp; you love it?
---
Wow you are delusional. 
---
This is why Mummy shouldn’t have bought you a phone before your 12th birthday.
---
The public teams addition really is a game changer. A change for the better. Glad you had such a great experience.
---
It makes me hopeful for dungeon/instance style objectives. Hunting high lvl legendaries in a den of mobs etc.  Public Teams would mesh so well with that style of gameplay.
---
Well a lot of games and new game are starting to implement them so I think it would be fine.
---
It's been 1 day. There is no comprehensive list.
---
He’s not saying it will go up to 200k he said ALTOGETHER for all exp score it will be that amount as the score needed to rank up goes up by a subtle 25 perk rank so rank 2 is 1025, 1050, 1075, 1100 and so on until it gets to roughly 3000+ to rank up again at the very last stretch
---
Happened to me aswell! I played a round of NW for the daily mission and after I logged onto Adventure Mode, Build up a Workshop/CAMP &amp; Gather Building Materials were both marked as completed with no SCORE awarded!
---
Would be amazing to get hands on the legacies from xbox players and i guess for them as well to get our beloved be fr plasma or all the lvc legacies 😜 but that would mess up the market even more i guess 😂
---
Thank you! I’ll give this a shot when I log in today. I joined another group and it worked but then messed up again the next group I joined.

4000 fusion cell ammo
---
60 points for 30 fusion cell ammo. 
---
WTF. Not complaining about the cost, but why can't we do 600 points for 300 fusion cell ammo. 
---
Why Bethesda? Allow me to actually enjoy using it. Instead, its getting scrapped. 
---
Why? Because I can sell the 40000 fusion cell ammo for 1 cap each and then trade the caps i get for the 4000 shotgun ammo i need MUCH EASIER. 
---
Rank 10 for me, day 2, and not enjoying this so far...
---
Shouldn't we focus on sorting out the problem we already have rather than throwing more fuel onto the fire?
---
Also, Sony.
---
weird flex, but hey if you have money to waste, why are you bitching and moaning about spending money?
---
 Of course they play it. They have some data that we dont have and based on the projections they decided to make it so.
---
If it turns out fucked they'll change it.
---
Let's all learn how to breathe, yes ? ;)
---
Then why is there talk about SCORE?
---
There's a clean toilet on the way.
---
Now if they can just add a shower and a couple of bathroom mirror options (a interior walls), we'll be gettin' some civilization all up in here.
---
Same here. I mean, I'd honestly be happy if they made a remake of 76 but made it so it's single player. It wouldn't be a great game because lots of people have already completed the quests but still. I'm honestly not hopeful about fallout 5, hopefully they'll take notes from what they and obsidian did with 3 and NV and make a game that looks like 4 in terms of graphics and things. If I had an online feature, I'd be fine with that. But I think I'd like to stick with the old formula of high quality single player fallout games
---
Or... Just pick 5 other items and bulk and scrap at the Tinker Workbench. 30 seconds and don't even need to leave the house!
---
It is on bethesda... Rocket league, minecraft bedrock, world War z, dauntless. All games with cross play.
---
But Bethesda took long enough to make their dedicated servers not run like shit so I doubt they can handle this
---
It doesn't make you spawn near the device but it does control where you spawn.
---
C team or not that is a massive fuck up. There’s no way anyone could have tried to use that thing and thought it was a good idea.
---
Were Public Events always supposed to grant SCORE for completion, or is it intended to be a random award?  I'm not seeing any consistency in when I receive it versus when I don't.
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek
---
Honestly, if this was the L100 reward, I would quit streaming and playing the game. And I've been around since the very first beta stress test.
---
Depends what level you are, for that beautiful gun I’d say do it
---
I right away threw my ammo on the ground.
---
I usually collect everything I see to sell! But that’s too hard not because of stash space.  Then I was like cool! Umm convert it! 
---
Nope, just drop it. Knew it would be terrible.
---
Sony stated months ago it was allowing developers to do cross platform. The thing is not a ton of dev's are gonna wanna write completly new code, test, fix then implement it on already released games. 
---
Well see alot of cross platform on next gen. At least between consoles.
---
Similar to me as well. Joined a team....we ran three SBQ events in a row, went to Radiation Rumble, then Project paradise, couple other ones thrown in. Good fun......ranked up my main a couple ranks.
---
I dont mean to be rude, but 2.5 hours is some peoples entire play time for a day or a week. For those less than casual players, it will be a chore
---
150
---
I play today on the PC but it sure would be nice if character profiles could be accessed on multiple platforms. I know the console folks don't want us filthy PC users around but I own one of everything these days. I would be handy to swap to better platforms over time without starting over.
---
Umm no, its called keeping the bar low, and you won't be disappointed.
---
The discussion is about public events giving Score points upon completion separate from challenges.
---
Public Events are supposed to, but they never said how.
---
To me, it appears to be completely at random, which would really suck, because even if they were a relatively low amount (like 100), that still could easily add up to an additional 1,000 a day.
---
Try to take comfort in the fact that even the top-tier rewards are kinda' "meh," and are really just aren't anything to get too worried about missing. That, and the fact that Bethesda is supposedly looking have some of these rewards available again at a late date (I would infer, probably for atoms). I would honestly be surprised if Bethesda \*didn't\* recycle these items at some point.
---
Well somehow I'm finding them because I've found both flame and ice grenades.
---
People seem to forget most battle passes are meant to last the whole time their out lol, no point making 100 levels of stuff if people finish it in a week and gotta wait 3-4 months for another, as long as I can grind events/do weeklies and hit max level I’ll be fine, I just can’t do daily’s every day.
---
Its like its designed to make people want to spend cash to skip the grind
---
Oh right ok.
---
yea i did the queen this morning an i didn't get anything
---
150 atoms per level after 2 weeks
---
[Who do people believe this bullshiz she lands fine on/inside the fences and can attack on top of things, you know as designed](https://imgur.com/VnsmzLT)
---
Oh man. You could do that, I’m level like 230 and I did it
---
And hey if you ever wanna play since we’re both on Xbox HMU my gamertag is Doctor Sadpanda level 200 bloodied build.
---
Please dont tell me they took that feature away. That was my only source of atoms
---
I did all my daily challenges and a few weekly ones yesterday. Ended with the exact score amount I was supposed to have (from what I can tell). Got rank 4.
---
Edit: all but the one NW daily. I didn't have time for that. My wife won't play NW lol. We always play together.
---
Ah this reminds me the good ol' days xD 
---
I farm for the entre year and i never got a Gjallahorn.  At least Xur sell it 1 month before it was vaulted. That's why i start creating my own squad to do the raids.  And i did everything.
---
It will probably come in September.
---
This is just what I needed! Thanks so much man!
---
I agree but take FFXIV for instance. You grind and grind for the endgame gear at the end of each expansion. Then the next expansion comes out and the first NPC town drunkard selling gear has better stuff than the previous expansion's endgame gear. It's insulting. Yes not the very first npc you meet but those who play FFXIV know what I mean. That's why when I beat the story for each expansion, I quit until the next one. No point in grinding for gear that gets outdated so fast when there's other games to play.
---
This made you quit ,really ? I find it very odd.
---
That's too bad.
---
Don’t worry, you’ll get 150 atoms every week or two
---
I don’t know, I’m currently new to the game. I just started to play the game again but I do see a lot of problems with the game especially how the economy works in the game.
---
They're enabling the MTX option in two weeks. It will cost 150 Atoms per level.
---
Huge buffs to exp gain this patch.... finally just get to play the game to reap the rewards.  Im all for the new system and reward loop.  
---
Those double XP weekends will actually be worth it now.
---
Right? Lmao screw an ammo converter, I need more decorative stuff for my camp with limited free space! :P
---
&gt;Do you expect them not to have a revenue stream and keep the game completely free and easy to appease people?
---
You act like the Legendary Run is their only revenue stream when you know full well it isn't.
---
This right here.
---
if NW had standard CTF and TDM.. I would be in there constantly...
---
Yes...just play the game.
---
Yeah the interface sucks from display to actual use.
---
The ability to buy levels (you cant skip ahead you have to buy the current level you are working on) doesn't unlock until two week into the season. One level per 150 atoms.
---
Ah, I didn't understand/read.  Sorry, it's been a long day and its not even noon.
---
I'll give it a shot!  Thanks!
---
Apparently loading into NW can break them. Lesson learned, though on the bright side you can get Halloween and Christmas rewards at the moment playing NW.
---
The reason it works well in Division is because every time you earn exp, you also earn season exp, which gives you a wide variety of options.
---
Here, unless you repeatedly farm 10k exp, you’re not given anything outside challenges.
---
The daily "complete an event is 0/1" and awards 250.
---
The weekly "complete an event in a group" is 0/5 and awards 1000.
---
The daily "Gold Star: Complete 5 daily challenges" is 0/5 and awards 250. 
---
I don't think public events are awarding SCORE at the minute, and people stating they got it are receiving it for the bugged 3/5 weeklies instead. 
---
Just done line in the sand as a test and other than 2x 100 for 10k xp I got no additional SCORE.
---
Tbh, it seems that all I do is run a shop when I play. I log in. Do my daily for my companion. I sit in my home - maybe collect some food. That's about it.
---
But where is it stated that 3k+ is where it will cap per rank? my main thought is we cant do an accurate calculation unless we know what the per rank cap is. I dont think it it will go higher than 2k but im open ears to complaints if it is. IMO it will stop at 2k, the devs would be shooting themselves in the foot with a TSE fixer if it goes any higher.
---
I carry a regular old fixer to SBQ fights just to make sure I get hits if I'm on my melee. Never fails.
---
The legendary run isnt a revenue stream. Point is you cant expect never ending content for free
---
Exactly. Also I like your idea, gonna go rig my pavements with spike traps
---
wonder if there's any chance of crossplay
---
Y'all whine too much just play the game
---
Scorchbeast brain, yum yum yum
---
Tf? Did they actually say that? Damn Bethesda man. This is bullshit
---
if the growth rate is linear, which it looks like it currently is (I'm at level 7). going from 1 - 100 would require 220275 xp.
---
currently there are 6 daily items for a total of 1500xp per day
---
there are 6 weekly changes for an additional 6000 with the one being repeatable for 100 per repeat.
---
Assuming nobody does the repeating one, if you played every day and got everything you'd make 16500 per week. which would require 13.35 weeks of work to complete the entire list. This started effectively July 1st and ends Sept 10th. which is only 11 weeks.  
---
so unless the growth rate is capped or resets at some point it's effectively impossible to get to 100 currently.
---
The Gauss rifle and pistol in vats
---
Someone else describes it above but there is some clipping with the hand when reloading. Nothing that creates a gameplay issue.
---
You can kill her pretty easy legit in 45 seconds without magic weapons, just takes good gear and buffs with some skill and a little luck
---
This team system is nice and all, but it should have been there in the beginning
---
From what I hear the ESO division in Beth does quite a good job on simple things that 76 div doesn’t. 
---
So maybe we’ll see improvements on many things. Maybe not.
---
USA has one of the lowest education rankings among first world countries. Give'em a break, he prolly thinks the world is flat.
---
If I play the game, how will I be able to reach lv 100 by the time the season ends?
---
Hah, yeah I remember first experiencing that in WoW when Burning Crusade came out.  The greens you got from the very first quests in the first zone were better than the raid gear I had from vanilla.  It's a gut punch but it's to be expected.
---
I tried to. There are many different ways to word the issue and no posts came up.
---
You're probably not far off. Word search on the engine of your choice, "Spaghetti code".  
---
I believe this is the issue with FO76. (from what I've read up about it anyway. I'm not a dev or coder by any means)
---
Make one minor change to it and it can randomly effect just about anything and the whole system can go haywire.
---
Complete trash.
---
I want content thats actually new. Not a suprise expense or lazy reskin that still clips. Maybe an investment into the THE UNIQUE 76 Factions... Not the BoS. It stinks of sloth and greed.
---
I never said it capped out, I said it increases steadily by 25 each rank until you reach the end which would be of upwards of 3000+ score, no cap I said, I said tha ts how much you would at least need to get to rank up once reaching rank 85/90 and going upwards, and I’m not complaining I’m simply utilizing my own vision and comprehension skills to notice a pattern of the score going up by 25 point each rank up which is the more rational and normal assumption because of pattern recognition
---
I wish I knew where that spawn point actually was. For me it's either behind my house or sometimes in it. I hate loading into my house for the first time because I've gotten stuck in the floor and needed to restart the game. Is it tied to where you initially place your camp module when first claiming a campsite? Or after the camp is built, I know I can freely move the device around without affecting my camp. I've tried moving it and I still spawn in the same spot. I don't know why they can't make a spawn point like FO4 had.
---
That's great I was considering it but didnt want to drag other players with my newbie ways :)
---
So I missed out on OG Gjally  day and then every time I would see it drop it would be for one of my friends. I was the person in my friend group that played the most but could never get it. 
---
One of the moments my one of my friend won’t let me live down is when I got him to re-download the game and I Sherpa’d him and a few other through Vault of Glass. 
---
We hit that chest before Gorgons that had a low chance to give out exotics and I straight up said “This has an incredibly low chance of exotics don’t get your hopes up.” My friend then immediately pulled a Gjally out of it. My luck was terrible and I’m still salty to this day.
---
Maybe i am misunderstanding your post you get the score points for being in a team
---
Nope, September will be patch 22 with “One Wasteland For All “
---
Intuitive design seems to be a big no no at Bethesda.
---
Exactly! 69 days left and some people are already reporting being at level 20. I got to level 6 last night. It’s not bad.
---
You are doing the Lord's work. 
---
Did my first NW game in a month last night for the 3 stimpack uses. My team came in first and I unlocked about 5 rewards I think, for 1500 exp earned. Explains a lot. 
---
I'd also like to draw attention to the fact that my team came in first. Not me. I was there. i was part of the experience. At the end, one of my teammates got downed, and I was right there with a stimpack. At some point, I heard them shooting at people, but couldn't see anything. Using the sounds and the notifications, I felt like I was really in the thick of it, you know? Like I was there!
---
Every now and then I'd fire off a shot to make it look like I was a real baller.
---
And right at the end, when we were celebrating, I was right there, emoting with them. All the while just thinking to myself: "Toby really was a useful little Engine".
---
Yeah. Thank goodness for autofill teams.
---
I noticed this, it's quite annoying. I get their American but I'm getting tiered working around a timezone I don't live in. 4pm was bad enough
---
You won’t get a straight answer because no one knows. It’s all conjecture with personal experience mixed with misunderstandings and bugs and whatever else. 
---
There may be different events later on, may be one off events, meat week etc may pop up and award more, public events may start rewarding properly or scorch beast event may be farmable for the 1000 it rewards. 
---
Just play do all you can/want to/have time for and see what happens or if they actually announce anything that’s definitive. Right now it’s day two and as sharp as my pitchfork already is I’m saving my judgement until this stuff is a little bit older and more understood than not even 48 hours old.
---
You don't earn score by completing events. You earn 100 score per 10000 xp gained in the game. You can track the challenge in the weekly section.
---
I'd say yeah that's pretty crazy at your level. However I guess it depends on how often you're planning on re-rolling to switch. 
---
I do love my bloodied commando, not that I have as nice a weapon as that. I'd roll a character just to use that weapon if it were me, or swap it for some nice heavy stuff if you can  find a good deal.
---
I'd offer you a trade but I don't have enough stuff to interest you, a furious explosive minigun or a 1* bloodied gatling gun is about as good as my heavies go. 
---
I don't really keep any heavies as I don't use them often.
---
How about public teams, isnt that good ?
---
Start a new character for the level ups and anything else that would be good on a new character. Then switch back to your main to claim the rewards.
---
To be far that argument could be made with every update to every game. Saying x feature should be there at launch always kinda annoyed me.
---
Creating another character is the best way. You can enjoy different builds without having to respec.
---
Because Bethesda.  They are the epitome of ineptness.
---
And yet, they say that you can get SCORE by completing Public Events.
---
Were you in a team?
---
Are they?
---
I've run both events multiple times yesterday and did get any SCORE from them.  Not to mention Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand, etc.
---
And I haven't seen Bethesda comment on this one way or the other whether or not it's a bug versus a random drop.
---
I also like it. For a low level player like me it looks interesting. Oh and public teams is such a good addition as well.
---
Still got like 8 years of updates left 😂
---
Link? Haven't seen it.
---
You cant leave stairs floating.
---
Yes...do daily and stuff but I'm already on lvl 8 with half my weeklies left.  You get 100 score for every 10k in xp.  Doesn't sound like a ton but you get xp for everything in this game.  If you play the game alot 100 will be no problem.
---
So let me get this right unless you do every single daily and weekly you won't get to 100 without atoms to level skip? If so that's proper shady business
---
"Hey you! Intern! Make this Sh\*t spin.  What do you mean *why?*"
---
Sounds good. I have a few characters. Level 170ish, level 130ish, 70, 55. I don’t do the bloody build thing but happy to team up sometime. 
---
Itzcmiltzertime
---
Just play the game and see how far you get lol if you’re a hardcore gamer like some act than go farm events or exp and if you’re a casual barely on gamer you should know you won’t get everything if there’s a time limit.
---
Working for some, not for others so I don't really know what's going on tbh.
---
Line in the sand didn't get me anything other than 2x 100 for 10k xp. 
---
Seems the reports of people getting SCORE for events are just people getting the reward for hitting 3/5 on the bugged weeklies at the same time as completing the event. 
---
The wording on the FAQ definitely states Public Events should award SCORE.
---
Bethesda said they were seriously considering adding text chat
---
Yeah, that would fix one problem, we still have the exp 10k equals 100 score, and it’s better to use a bigger build to wipe west tek in two minutes for quicker exp for score, I’m not making a new character for a challenge that may or may not happen again
---
It's cosmetic and not functional. It works cause you click it...
---
We don’t know. 
---
There’s conflicting posts because people are making assumptions about scaling of the points needed.  
---
We don’t know what future weeklies and dailies will look like.  We don’t know if there’s a cap, or if there will be exponential growth once you hit chapter two.  
---
You’re best bet is to just assume you’ll need to do all the dailies and all the weeklies in order to hit rank 100.   If you hit it early, well great.  If you can’t hit it even with doing everything, then the design was flawed to begin with and we have something else to throw at Bethesda as a failure
---
Someone just did the math here in the post. Too long for me to remember lol. But check it out!
---
But basically yes. But that’s ofc if the progression is linear. As it looks to be now. But even IF you do every task it’s not enough
---
Are you that dense?  There was zero plan to introduce NPCs at launch.  Bethesda literally said the players are the humans in the game.  Then they realized that it wasn't enough and we got wastelanders.
---
Was expecting some uplifting spiritual post about how the future holds alot, I was fooled.
---
I'll let you know. I actually dont remember how I got it. I'm starting to think u/itscmillertime was on to something.
---
I have and play fo76 on Xbox 
---
Does this mean if I bought a computer
---
I could play fo76 on that computer using my Xbox character on the computer?
---
No new to start a new character 
---
Could actually keep all my progress while switching to pc?
---
No one is making that accusation except you.
---
Ohh, this just came out?? I didn't realize that. I thought it had been out for a while. There wasn't too much information on the homepage of the game.
---
What's the deal with the team leads, etc?
---
It's tied ti wherever the device is at the time. Normally it will spawn you north east of the device. Not sure what happens if your device is on the north east side of your camp though. Your initial spawn and fast travel are two different places though.
---
Edit: they tried travel mats. They got removed due to abuse.
---
I noticed sometimes it would award the points for a challenge when completing a part of it. Like I got the points for the “kill different kinds of robots” challenge when I killed one assaultron
---
I sherpa's tons of people during Y1 of D1.  From the Vault Of Glass to Crota's End and nightfall. I never got the Gjallahorn.  ( but i got the mythoclast every week. At least i could use laser to have fun. Pew pew ! Sorry )    All the people i help got the Gjallahorn and the icebreaker ( miss this when Xur was selling it,  i was at hospital) and guess what ? I was playing every goddamn day. I got the icebreaker a week before TTK.  I was mad.
---
If you’re on Xbox feel free to add me GAmer tag is Doctor Sadpanda
---
Problem is nobody buys 38, 10mm, Fuel, syringes stuff like that. The converter was meant for us to be able to use it to get ammo we wanted, but it didn't work out that way and is just a waste of space with horrible UI
---
Create a new character. Use your main to craft a lvl 30 fixer and a full set of heavy leather shadowed, deep pocketed set (every 20 levels or so) and it's gonna be a breeze.
---
He wasn't really yelling, but he wasn't happy. If there was text chat I would have messaged him. 🤔
---
That’s exactly what i did. One toon have max STR and the other have max PER, that got most cool weapons covered for my enjoyment.
---
I think the only way to get score points for an event is to be in a team. At least thats what my weekly challenge said.
---
You can cut down on the time converting ammo by using the "back" button (tab on PC) after selecting the ammo you want to convert/ammo you want to turn in points for. I was able to convert thousands of .38, 10mm, and fusion cells this morning in roughly 15 minutes. I plan to use it to convert whatever unwanted ammo I have on me when visiting my camp and only redeem my points for ammo when I hit the max (2000) going forward.
---
Don't get me wrong though, I'm not defending this design choice at all. It's awful.
---
Every time a new mmo grind comes out everyone does the math and complains about how long it will take. And every time six months later everyone has all the new stuff and is complaining there is nothing to do. 
---
New content release doesn’t mean you just get all the new shit right away. I like having to work hard to earn things in games, I like having things to work to in games. 
---
If you’re playing the game trying to get every item as fast as possible how are you even having fun? Serious question.  I guarantee if you slow down and take the time to enjoy the immersion, environment, ect you’ll find out its a much better way to game. You’ll all of a sudden find you have no desire to complain about how long and hard a grind is.
---
Have you tried moving and deleting the blueprint?
---
I'm on ps4 :/
---
Yes but with herbivore boosts now brain fungus soup passes that, and you get cranberry relish boosted so its +3 INT for brain, v.s. +5 for soup AND +25% for relish. Worth crafting now.
---
Nope, gamepass isn't cross platform play. Everything will still be separated.
---
Hah i never thought of that.. 1050+ hours and never used a blueprint lol.  Thanks I'll give that a try.
---
Well i believer it’s supposed to reduce server lag when you open a container and leave a useless pieces of ammo the server still loads it the converter makes all ammo useful which helps reduce lag
---
Yep that’s my guess too
---
Is this a plug for your channel?
---
I appreciate the info as I didn't know about that despite playing since beta. Now let's never talk about it again ;)
---
Yeah, I had some delays yesterday - but once your dailies and weeklies are finished it's pretty easy to see nothing's happening.
---
On the plus side it's just a personal preference if you want to stay hydrated now.
---
Just so long as it's consistent, whatever they end up with
---
Which platform? Ammo converter? lol
---
I slow down close to the end to keep from overshooting. I'm not saying it's great, I just thought other people might like to know.  I didn't program the thing.
---
Awesome, you're the first person I've seen with the actual answer as to where the spawn point is! Yeah that doesn't surprise me with the mats lol.
---
This is a bit messed up honestly. I have never even heard of an online game that has a limited event where you have to do EVERYTHING EVERY DAY and that doesn't even give you everything (limited drop rate stuff excluded, of course). Honestly I don't really mind in a way, as I'm the kinda person who can not play as much and wouldn't get everything anyway, but it's kinda stupid not even playing everyday takes you to max level.
---
I got to level 6 in 3 hours. It’s not hard at all.
---
Because that would require effort, simply.
---
Be careful, then.
---
Interface sucks.
---
Yeah.
---
I have no channel. I also subscribe to multiple youtuber channels related to Fallout 76. This just struck me as funny.
---
Its unfortunate how stupid you really are. People pick up ammo they don't need to sell it to people who do need it, and then use the caps to buy ammo they need. This was supposed to be a way to make it easier, but instead its useless.
---
Do you mean the challenge that says complete 5 daily challenges? That basically only means complete all daily challenges not daily quests
---
Well I'm sure I'm not the only wastelander who is disappointed that Adventure and NW modes don't have separate daily challenges. I don't play NW and frankly never will. Reminds me too much of the Destiny grinds. Hated those and I won't allow any developer to force me to do something I don't enjoy. Good luck everybody on the SCORE path. Some of us filthy casuals will just go along for the ride but everyone will wonder why BGS found it necessary to continue this foolishness.
---
Or an abused Mr Handy looking for revenge
---
What's the point of getting to 100?  Getting more junk?  None of it equals better gameplay, new NPCs, new questlines, or map expansion.  Actual gameplay is what will keep me interested in this game.   I couldn't care less about treating this game like a job in order to earn more junk.   I'll just play something else if it comes to that.
---
O ok.
---
Sounds/ looks like hes trying to delete the foundation
---
Update is dope... new trailer is out.... public teams are fun.... XP buffs are insane.  
---
Im not getting on board with the OPs gaslighting.
---
&gt; I mentioned this to understand how crazy it is to task novices with this subject 
---
And yet you still used the [misleading](https://kotaku.com/the-controversy-over-bethesdas-game-engine-is-misguided-1830435351) argument "engine bad" instead of correct perspective to offer actual insightful solution to the problem.
---
&gt;  There was an MMO using the "gamebryo engine" 
---
on the sidenote, what is the game?
---
Welp seasons are optional and you can still play the game without doing seasons and only non cosmetic item in the seasons are ammo converter and it is lvl 5 at seasons if you are gonna tell me you cant get to lvl 5 in 10 week I dont think bethesda can do anything about it
---
I may well have been receiving Score for challenges during the SBQ by the sounds of it: I was on a server that did three of them back to back and was picking up points throughout the whole time. If managed to do most of the daily and weekly’s already by that point so I kinda assumed the new rewards were event related, but by the sounds of things...probably not.
---
I'm doing the events now to see if the events do award or not but I'm pretty sure they didnt encrypted 1 time today nothing load baring nothing doing scorched earth now
---
It does what it's supposed to do.
---
Is it slow and tedious? Yup! But it still takes useless ammo and turns it into needed ammo.
---
We asked for it, we got it, and some people still aren't happy. 
---
/shrug
---
For the love of god why can't we just get some quality of life improvements that are actual improvements?
---
It seems like the increase in score required per lev is very small like 25 per lev but I'll have to verify that cuz it may start to increase more as you go
---
Yeah it’s an easy mistake to make really, because the way people are talking in some threads you’d think it was ancient and everyone was already fed up of it and knew definitively what was gonna happen and what is or isn’t possible. 
---
The numbers behind grinding to 100 are fairly insane for casual players, but again there seems to be a few bugs so anger at that is definitely understandable, but as for the rest we have no idea what will be added tweaked or used to gain points in future. 
---
The fact is they don’t want people grinding out such a long event in days, but that’s not to say stuff won’t be dropped later on that will allow catchup or different ways to earn. The colossus event is coming at some point, as is legendary perks. There could be other changes when those are added etc. No one knows yet 😁
---
Public teams are kinda cool. Anyone can set them up then get bonuses for synergizing with friendlies. I personally have been farming x4 XP for events in teams, sharing perks getting all ways to boost XP income and getting more score for the repeatable XP stuff.
---
I’ve made it to level 11 fairly easily so far with about 4/5 hours or play.
---
Understandable, the point I was trying to make was I wasn't doing the new dailies... I was vendor hopping and I did maybe 7 or 8 little events, rad rumble once and 2 queen fights. If you use the public teams to your advantage you get double xp for events so you'll get a few level ups as well. I honestly wasn't trying. We have 100 days so I'm just saying it's achievable without grinding
---
This right here is the best reason to keep them separated. Pc has way to many hacked weapons. We’d ruin your platforms.
---
For me it’s the camp items. I’m a huge “builder”! Spending most of my time there. 
---
And the fireplace is one of the last items. So yeah
---
yeah i am trying to delete the foundation
---
This is the reason I stopped playing Destiny 2 and now Fallout 76 is doing it... the FOMO of a season like this just ruins the fun of the game.
---
If you like the older games there’s 2 mods in the works  that bring fo3 and nv into fo4 . There are some trailers on YouTube they look very good !
---
Was meant as sarcasm 😬
---
Had the same story happening to me. It was my first char (still main) and he was melee all da wey when i got a commando god roll like that. He was around 150 at that time and i got where i wanted to be at lvl 200. But because i got a few other god rolls in other weapon types in the process, soon my goal changed to get a bloodied build going that could dominate with all those melee/shotgun/commando and heavy RNG Goodies i found. And i got there. He is my only successful mix build. Thanks to the perk loadout manager. Without it, it would never have been possible.
---
You don’t need to play the whole season, just play and earn the rewards you want
---
They tried this the last time I was there but this is where the advantage of being a level 300+ comes in, I just stood at the Juke Box and kept refreshing it as I blasted away at the gouls with my 2 Shot explosive Gatling Gun.
---
Possibly.
---
On the other hand, they didn't pitch this like a collective event, like Clean Appalachia was.  There, they wouldn't want it to look like players fell short.  Here, though, they could care less if players made it to the end or not.
---
Frankly, the fact that they mathematically left zero wiggle room despite the notorious buggyness of their game kind of speaks volumes.
---
Hmm I have the gauss mini gun. What changed in vats?
---
The FAQ for Seasons rollout says:
---
Which suggests Public Events should award SCORE, outside of challenges.
---
Have your girlfriend build the next one and then blueprint it. Everyone wins that way!
---
70
---
Except there are people posting on here that HAVE gotten score for doing some events. It's all a bit up in the air atm, it's all conjecture and personal experience with possible bugs added into the mix. 
---
It'll take a bit of time to settle and for us to establish what should and shouldn't be working I reckon.
---
Agreed.  I too had a blast last night
---
The sooner you get into it, the better regardless of how things actually work out.
---
The going theory is that with just challenges alone, it won't be enough to get to Rank 100 and you'll need to do recurring xp challenges to make up the difference.
---
However, we don't know anything for certain. Things could just be fine. Things could get a lot worse and more grindy. 
---
In any case, sooner you get in, the easier it is for you to keep up, if that's your goal.
---
If you're looking to trade I have a 3* TSE50drwa 50cal and a TSffr250drwr
---
This is the most impactful thing they’ve done for the game since vending.
---
That 100 score for 10000 xp is repeatable so can do as many times as you like and bethesda specifically said you will get score from public events
---
Well that was the easiest way to get me to not play the game.
---
I suppose that’s fair. I haven’t even looked at it since the update but from what I’ve heard there are a few things in there actually worth the effort. Like the ammo converter cause if we are being honest, it’ll probably get reworked if the community keeps complaining. But even then everything else in it is like skins and a couple odd atoms. So yeah I guess it’s just go for what you want and then stop
---
It's on Xbox, but I checked back in today and it must have been a glitch or something because it's back to normal and working again.
---
Well, it's hard to go wrong with anything *after* that because it has no functionality.  It's just PA skins, clothes, and CAMP stuff, mostly.  I think the Ammo Converter may be the only thing on offer that has some new function behind it.
---
Remember that it’s one of the first rewards to get. This machine will help low level players that just started the game a whole lot more than it’s going to help people that eat fresh scorchbeast Queen for lunch every day.
---
But they did this purposely. 
---
They can’t come out and make it fully p2w. The media/fan base would go crazy. So the trick is to make it so you WANT to p2w. Like say, if you played for weeks only to find out you are soooooooo close to the end but fell short. So, why not just spend some atoms to jump to the end.
---
It's not an exact science but it's worth moving it around and testing until you're happy with where you're landing.
---
From the FAQ for seasons:
---
&gt;Q:ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.? A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
Yup, completed the daily and weekly challenges and I'm not getting any SCORE from events. People probably getting confused due to SCORE being given erratically.
---
I may have gotten 50 from scorched earth
---
Fixing their core design flaws that make that true would really be a better answer. Their client/server architecture seems to have the security equivalent of a mall cop.
---
Yeah the worst we have is glitched NW lasers brought into adventure which aren't even that common at all and the "magic" stuff that everyone has.    It sucks because there are actually a ton of people on PC i've met through here and the forums and twitch that I'd love to play with but It would just be absolute chaos.  Not worth it.  Not to mention the hell that would ensue in NW.
---
Honestly yesterday I got on and couldn't even be bothered to finish the daily quests
---
I think it's bugged. It's a bit ambiguous in the patch notes, but on the FAQ section of the Seasons page I don't see how this can mean anything other than public events being supposed to give SCORE:
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, **and by completing Public Events**. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
I’m not getting Score for events, ones without the ! on them and ones with the !, not sure what’s going on.
---
Honestly the easiest fix to this issue is to award a non-nominal amount of score (500 points for example) for completing public events. We could even have a public team option that boosts score rewards instead of xp. Ofc, this all assumes that Beth haven’t calculated all of this to explicitly drive people to purchase ranks with atoms.
---
i placed a foundation then attached stairs on top of it then placed another foundation to the stairs now it wont let me delete them
---
“We want a reason to play!!!”
---
“Who has time for this?!”
---
I heard that, but haven’t determined how things are different yet.
---
The game wont let you have stairs that arent attached to a foundation..
---
Lmao season 2 coming in the fall so we got til October/November
---
xD
---
Scratch that thought gain xp was for 50 yea so nothing from queen ether
---
It's either a bug, or it's not intended we get them and the FAQ statement was false.
---
I was soooo looking forward to the ammo converter. But it is so disappointing. I was expecting it to break down ammo into its components, not give you points and demand more points then the ammo is worth.  And a 2000 max ammo point cap?!  What if I'm carrying 100k in useless ammo and can only scrap 1000 of it at a time, or what if I need more than 90 2mmEC?  I'd rather deposit all the ammo I dont want at once and not have ANOTHER USELESS TOKEN LIMIT!  LIKE SERIOUSLY, we can't give away are ammo tokens, just allow us to scrap all our waste ammo in one go.
---
I don't have a thing like main game.
---
I just happen to have 2 weekends during that time I can spend half of the day playing the rest of the week I rarely have more than an hour of free time.
---
During these weekends I like to play different games, one weekend I may have the mood for minecraft and the other for dark souls, thus i spend the same 1 or more hour on Fallout76, at times leaving the game for months, because the moment your game becomes a job is the moment you should consider consulting a addiction specialist, IMHO of course.
---
I personally doubt you're currently full time employed otherwise you would have treasured your own time much more than this.
---
I do subscribe to 1st whenever I feel like playing the game the whole month, or when I start feeling the storage space limitations to pressure me, as for buying the atoms, I do this rarely because I don't see anything worth it, for instance my favorite skins are the red and blue(forgot the name)pump shotgun skin and matte black handmade and till now I didn't see any skin for the excavator power armor that I would actually like, so the atoms that I was earning while casually playing where more than enough to get the good skins.
---
I’m not talking bulk ammo scrap, i just want to bulk 1000 .38 rounds and sell them for 150 caps. (For example)
---
Darn lol
---
Ahhhh ok...tbh I playd for about 90 mins last night and got to level 5 with 4/5 dailies done and 1 weekly. I did 2 events as well. I guess we will see what happens.
---
I almost bad for the developer that actually thought of it and convinced the others on the team that this was a good idea.
---
LOL. First, this thread is about the ammo converter, not buying ammo. Second, of course people sell ammo. I sell ammo. I sell a lot of ammo. The amount of ammo you can buy from any given machine isn't that much. Third, if you are buying ammo, I'm sure you aren't buying ammo that you don't need. Which is something I've been saying.
---
So the fact you brought up buying ammo in a thread about converting ammo you don't need, and picking up ammo you don't need. 
---
That shows just how amazingly stupid and moronic YOU ARE. LOL. I mean seriously, are you really suggesting people are buying ammo they don't need? LOLOLOLOL.
---
&gt; daily and realistically can only play three days a week because of work.  
---
&gt;Basically impossible to finish it. Thanks Bethesda.
---
Maybe not everyone are supposed to get everything? Then they should just give everyone the rewards at the beginning if it. I know it sucks, but making it easier isn´t that great of a thing. I think it´s a great thing they added a way to pay up. After this reason we will see if it is too high of a requirement.  it's a balancing act.
---
Yeah no kidding
---
i want picture or video proof of someone getting SCORE from public events. this should be a front page thread instead of several of the same thing clogging it. with how ridiculous the grind is going to be, this is the only thing that will make it bearable.
---
Someone just did the math here in the comments. Check em out. Too long for me to remember lol
---
They working on Wastelanders before Fallout 76 was launched
---
Having similar issues on PC. Not getting awarded S.C.O.R.E. after completing a Challenge. Currently rank 6.
---
I have marsupial and a jetpack I was looking for a workaround because I enjoy other types of headwear and you know, fashion XD. But thanks for replying!
---
Fairly quickly = 30 minutes?
---
This thing should be a 2 step process
---
I'm rank 10 and that's all weekly challenges already completed, dailies as well. 
---
Was not hard at all to complete them. 
---
Not sure who is saying you have to do every single daily. Based on what i can see, XP is the biggest assist here as it gives 100 points per 10k xp. Bloated give 160+ depending on buffs you have. 
---
Nuke whitesprings on your private server, xp from the nuke run, plus plenty of xp from bloated. I leveled 4 times since the legendary run started yesterday afternoon. Not even 24 hours ago. I've played maybe 4-5 hours so far?
---
I'll hit 100 by end of the month if not way earlier.
---
I’m running as a stealth riflemen/sniper. Already well equipped with an 3*AA lever action and I’ve got a few 3* handmades (vamp, furious, TSE) but I’m always on the lookout to upgrade. Love to get my hands on a furious or AA fixer to replace my handmade so I’ve only got to pack around one type of ammo.
---
When you've got a mighty thirst and absolutely no desire to have children.
---
Yeah I know ...we really need cross play. Not with PC players though , as there are way too many hackers there unfortunately.
---
Ah well ,when you get a ps4 let me know 😅
---
I don't think you see your own.  The bonus comes from the individual teammates being part of your team for long enough.  What you see is probably a mirror of what they see with respect to your affinity gauge.
---
here's hoping for crossplay too
---
I always use the chinese stealth when around heavy rads, but for the most part I prefer and outfit over my armour, that's why I was looking for a workaround. I think I will keep the wetsuit until maybe something else pops up, who knows. Thanks for your input!
---
I don't know or care about anything to do with SCORE but I do absolutely love seeing lots of people showing up for events. Even the boring ones. That's pretty rad
---
Thank ya
---
***whoosh***
---
The SBQ is quite possibly the most disinterested final boss in all of video games.
---
"Oh, is that someone shooting at me?  Hurp-pa-derp... I guess I'll fly another circle over here in the corner."
---
Yup. Seasons were made for three reasons: 1. They are very trendy with online games right now, Bethesda wanted to jump on that train; 2. They are there to provide another way for people to spend money; 3. To change it so that the premium items are not "given away" for free, but instead, non-paying players are given a standard amount of mediocre content and fewer free atoms. There is no reason for them to extend the season. It was intended that people would not actually be able to complete the season without paying to skip some levels, aside from a few die hard players who play for many hours every day.
---
My guess is that the repeatable weekly is going to alternate from week to week. This week it’s earn 10k XP for 100 points. Next week it will be complete “X” number of public events for “Y” points. Just my gut feeling.
---
Cause a designer and core gameplay coder is the exact same job
---
I see the bottom foundation now... that may be tricky. Sometimes you have to build more off the foundation you want to delete. Maybe try adding another foundation &amp; stair to the bottom and use an upper floor at the top of the stair..?
---
Is his bar or any other ally station in your stored tab?
---
And that made me laugh out loud
---
If we don't post about it, they will think this item was a success.
---
I bet you don't vote either
---
Maybe your just too busy whining about the same shit that's been posted 100 times before
---
Heh, try Herbivore and Cranberry Cobbler. ;)
---
Anyways, the math is *really* not in your favor, but I also overstated.
---
By week 3, you'll need to gain 1014 levels worth of XP, assuming you do *every* weekly and daily objective, including the Nuclear Winter one. If you aren't doing the NW one, then it's 1047 levels.
---
So that's more like 50 levels a day.
---
Keep in mind 6000 of those XP were the weeklies. A score level is around 1000xp or so. So that’s about 6 of those levels just from weeklies that you won’t have acess to until next “week”.  
---
But I’d love to see you do that lol. Be sure to post it ;)
---
They likely did it this way to avoid any potential for duping.
---
Childish? Are you fucking serious?
---
Beth is counting on people getting close to 100 but needing a push and therefore will rank up using atoms. It's just like a predatory mobile game 😜
---
You used to be able to cripple her wings to force her to land.  It was a very Fallout-y mechanic.  And they got rid of it because... well, no knows why.  Maybe they wanted to make it take longer?  But then they did absolutely *nothing* about all of these jokers showing up with hacked .50 cals who melt her in seconds.
---
I’ve seen reports that Scorched Earth is 1000. I’m looking forward to verification (as well as a points/event breakdown) from Bethesda.
---
I checked. Cannot find any ally items in the stored tab.
---
Oh yea, after about 5 hours I'm on spot number 8.
---
https://youtu.be/RZuudnyjCA8
---
The items are cosmetic mostly, with gold bullion, atoms, or scrip every ten levels. Completing the challenges aren't making the game easier ornharder for anyone, but they give endgame players something to do other than farm flux and the queen.
---
Well duper’s can already get whatever ammo they need so I can’t see why they would use the machine to get a less effective result.
---
I usually share mysterious savior. I wish I could see the reactions of people in the group when they happen to die randomly while doing a daily or something and just happen to get revived.
---
From what I saw in the trailer:
---
1. A Colossal Problem, likely coming with Patch 21, my guess late July
---
2. Legendary Perks, likely coming with Patch 21 or 22, guessing late July or August
---
3. Atlas Observatory event, probably similar to the Scorched slaying event, but with over-time updates to the game with community rewards for reaching certain Scrap donation milestones, maybe Patch 21 or 22, late July or August
---
Can you place any other allies?
---
I think people need to stop freaking out and doing math based on assumptions.
---
We'll see. I'm already rank 12 without the dailies resetting yet.
---
I will try.
---
[roadmap ](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png)
---
It say fall and the odds of them releasing that update in the Beginning of the fall are very slim . They are delayed on summer update patch too it wasn’t fully release
---
It absolutely hasn't done so for me.
---
If it does, then it must be completely random.  I've gotten zilch from every Public Event.
---
But both in tandem make a shit QOL item
---
Cared enough to comment lol
---
You have to be kidding. I've never seen a gaming company work harder to try to make improvements and make a great experience for its players. You sound like somebody that played the game once when it first released and never picked it up again. It's a great game and it keeps getting better.
---
Why is it garbage? Cuz you think its gonna be to hard to finish? In the first 2hrs I got to rank 10 so if I keep that pace I'll be done in 20hrs and you'll be the same person on here in a few weeks complaining it was to easy and you dont have anything to do again. Sounds to me like your butt hurt cuz your not good enough to complete it
---
Anywhere north of the winding path along the cliff is good. I recommend near the lake because you can get purified water
---
There's been some talk that some achievements are getting credited early (kill robots/build up C.A.M.P, I can confirm the camp one paid out at 3/5 for me yesterday) so maybe that's what happened. Also, there's a weekly repeatable of gain 10000 xp, that can pop at seemingly random times.
---
Not really sure why, but I keep randomly getting SCORE. It might be from my teammates doing stuff, but who knows?
---
Don’t get rid of it. I was a heavy gunner and rolled a lot of good commando and rifleman guns that I traded away and regret it. Since I use a bloodied stealth build now.
---
I don't know how duping works, I was just trying to rationalize why they would choose this horrible method.
---
Good to know. I seen them but didn’t pick them up
---
It’s probably an alt account because he doesn’t want to risk his fake internet points.
---
Oh okay, so why does with only seem to work when I target in Vats? Is it a glitch or?
---
A little over 25,000
---
Thank you for this. Must have read a false article
---
Wait, all the challenges don't give enough to reach 100 in time? Sorry what??!
---
That could well be the case. No reason why they couldn't swap it daily even. It would fit with the FAQ response and OP's quote.
---
Is it stored?
---
They could just as easily be seeing the Legendary 10/10 challenge completing, or events in a team, or even the XP bonus.  The fact that the SCORE meter doesn't tell you which challenge actually triggered it to appear doesn't help.
---
Are they things like the scrapping materials? Many people are getting the rewards at 3/5 complete.
---
Still no legendary perks?
---
Guess I'll just keep playing path of exile until you actually add something worthwhile
---
I think it's perfectly fine the way it is.  Not everybody is going to be able to get to level 100 and that is the way it should be.
---
Nope
---
Well, I want the fireplace door... And it’s not like we can pick and choose what rewards we get, it’s set in a specific path.
---
I believe it is bugged I am 100% sure I got score from sbq after completing it i had got 1k score and before that when I did sbq I did not.
---
Has there been an official message stating they're investigating it? Just curious if we can gauge how much time we may have to get this done (I'm one away from finishing Halloween stuff, two away from finishing Christmas... Was only gonna do a few runs and see what I got. It's now 10am and I haven't slept. XD).
---
Are you sure you didn't get the score earlier, on completion of the third rank for the building and robots challenges?. 
---
Happened to me last night, it's bugged for lots of people from what I've read.
---
Yeah understandable. All I know about duping is that it needs to be a stackable item (like ammo) and then you can get as much of that item as you need. The ammo converter was just a poorly executed device and I’m sure Bethesda will be reworking it very soon.
---
Yup. It's literally just adding more structure to game play while making 90% of your atom purchase choices for you.
---
As much as I want the skeleton I feel the same. I got the weapon skins and called it a day, but it will be nice to have a head start when this stuff is available again intentionally.
---
this, we dont know if it scales indefinitely, if there is a cap on score needed/tier, if the score needed resets at each board phase, if each weeks dailies/weekly's go up in value.  there are __way to many unknown variables__ to make any guess at the current time.
---
unless someone comes and datamines how each tier works, we are gonna have to figure it out as we go
---
Unless you use atoms
---
Ive unlocked all mods for it. If your on xbox one i can mod it if you like? I unlocked by crafting and scrapping them
---
I think you should check due east of bravo silo.  Go up the mountain and you will find it.  Was camped there for 9months then they put a tent there for wastlanders.  Great spot but it was time to move.
---
Edit...east not wast
---
I didnt get any progress towards the challenge completion yesterday when I scrapped them. 
---
I think its just another random bug
---
They been shitting over us all since day 1 buddy. Every now and then they gratiate us with summat good, (wastelanders, meat week) but on the whole, they're just pieces of corn in a constant stream of detritus.
---
Bethtism at its finest

Directly from [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons):

### Q: Aside from Challenges, what other activities will increase my S.C.O.R.E.?
---
A
---
A:  In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by  gaining XP, and **by completing Public Events**. Nuclear Winter Daily  Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other  rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other  methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
Awesome!  Thanks!
---
I was skeptical about public teams, but have to agree with you - had an absolute blast last night going from one event to another and multiple teams being there.
---
It’d be hard to determine if they are getting it from the public event or some other factor, such as they just happened to hit 10K experience
---
That must be what it is. It was the destroy robots and gather building supplies challenges. Thanks
---
You said that we shouldn't pick up ammo we don't need, which is completely ridiculous. Just because the scorched I kill drops 308 instead of 556 doesn't mean I shouldn't pick it up. I never suggested that people buy ammo they won't use, I'm suggesting that they pick up ammo they won't use so they can sell it or trade it to other player for ammo they will use. You're contradicting yourself here buddy. You tell everyone not to pick up ammo they won't use and then you said that you do it all the time and sell it. So what's the point of you saying it in the first place if you don't agree with it yourself? In case you didn't know that called being a hypocrite (something you probably won't understand)
---
It seems to be very efficient at converting UX frustration into Reddit rage points. I’ve not earned one of these yet, but after the last day and a half, can’t wait to get my hands on this abomination. In some inexplicable way, I just know my camp needs a Springfield Tire Fire of this magnitude.
---
Yeah cancelling the awards pop up (bringing up pipboy or pause menu for example) means it'll often replace the next one or generally a notification we didn't even know about.
---
Yeah there is that wonderful aspect happening, people joining events in large numbers
---
I’m just gonna post a link to the math we expect is correct atm.

---
Oh okay fair enough
---
&gt; And yet you still used the misleading argument "engine bad"
---
That is your interpretation (probably after fighting trolls using this to laugh about your beloved dev hundreds of times), leave me out of this. I said the engine is this old, not the particular version of it, holy cow.
---
&gt; to offer actual insightful solution to the problem
---
Because that's what players are supposed to do, offer solutions.
---
Talk to any dev, they will tell you that we're good at identifying problems and bad at coming up with solutions.
---
&gt; on the sidenote, what is the game?
---
Would have to look it up again just like you.
---
I'm done here, have a nice day.
---
Just because it is a new item doesn't mean it has flaws that result in duping
---
Eh, i might but im not sure.
---
I see - my mistake.  Thanks for clarifying
---
I believe they said it's coming out in Patch 21
---
I was going to say the XP one will tick quite a few times naturally doing dailies/weeklies and quests.
---
Those are the two I had the issue with so that must be it. Thanks
---
Not helpful - but something very similar happened to me and I never physically completed it either. I feel your pain. I still got the trophy though at least, and was able to experience the story via a friend as team leader.
---
I wonder if being on a full Public Team that is fully bonded affects it. Because I was on one and I did Scorched Earth and got the 1000 SCORE.
---
Dam it.
---
Edit: thanks for posting the link btw
---
You are correct they do make good trailers.
---
I like the rebuilding part.  I can't wait to see more of that.
---
Same. The robots one and camp one for me.
---
Exactly what I've done. Came back for wastelands and noped tf out when it was possible for other players to steal your stuff. Server stability is only good if you have fo1st which is primarily because of duping bugs that keep sneaking into updates. Been playing tons of other great games with far better support. GTAV, Division 2, even a little Destiny, all with better support, less bugs and better end game content. I still watch this sub in hopes of seeing people post about improvements, but the only thing people compliment fo76 on is the nice community. I had high hopes for this game but it's become a super grindy cash grab.
---
RIP. Atleast you actually do damage though, even if it's half..
---
Did you try hopping to another server? This might just be the server you're on.
---
**They've been saying that for a year**
---
I was offered a LOT of bucks for my 445 lvl toon lol. I just couldn't
---
Look at it this way. When you get near the end, take a look at the rewards for the last few levels and see how many atoms it will cost you to finish. Then weigh whether you would buy those items for that price in the atom shop. If the answer is no, then don't use your atoms to skip levels, save them for something else. There is no benefit to getting all the score rewards aside from the actual items themselves and bragging rights. If the end items aren't worth atoms to you, there is no reason to skip levels.
---
Servers randomly cycle down so you may have just been on one that was up for cycling.  Hop to another one and you should be fine.
---
I smashed my head onto this machine for like 10minute now I have 30 2mm cels
---
I was correcting your spelling. You said *Could Care Less*. It should be *Couldn't Care Less*.
---
Man, I'm stupid. I completely forgot Lone Wanderer doesn't work when you're on a public team
---
Except I never denied there have been changes, I keep pointing this out to you people but you're not getting it and you're the type of people I'm complaining about
---
Could be it aye, time will tell I think. After another few days of people testing different things It'll come out.
---
Well the increase in required score per lev is very minimal (25 per level) so if that stays ture the whole time its 1k for lev 1 and it'll be 3500 for lev 100
---
That's funny because the title is a post from a year ago from the Bethesda Community Team
---
You and I had the exact same bug whatever it was.
---
I do get that. But to say those weeklies were difficult? 
---
Craft armor? 25 level 1 leather torsos
---
Destroy 5 dif robots?
---
You can get 84 levels total just from doing the weeklies. 
---
As this week was 7500 total including the leveling challenge. 
---
So that means log in once a week, and thats 84 levels. 
---
12 times you log in, your going to do the dailies as well right? So that brings you to 96. 
---
Include the xp you get from doing events, nuking, killing scorchbeasts. I really don't see how people cannot level quickly through this entire thing. 
---
Its actually built for casuals.
---
Aye, same with Dynamite. Was hoping we could craft them and sell them on, but no!
---
Feed the people nothing
---
Could just be the server you are on.thi happens from time to time, they will do maintenance on one server. Just hop to another.
---
I greatly appreciate that!
---
Yes. I did. The game isn’t about hoarding literally everything you can. 
---
And I pick up ammo that people use the most, but I don’t pick up all ammo. See. 
---
I 
---
Pick
---
And
---
Choose
---
What
---
To
---
Pick Up.
---
Because that’s playing the game smart. Instead of being an entities crybaby gamer. Cause here’s the thing. If you can sell it. Then you can use it! 
---
I don’t use shotguns, but I sure do sell a lot of shells. Mostly because people are literally to lazy to do things on their own in this game.
---
So many of you wouldn’t even survive the vault. Lol.
---
I'm going to do exactly like I do with nuclear winter : casually do whatever and get a few new things. I'll not ever reach 100
---
Exactly what I tell people when they wonder why our Covid cases have skyrocketed and gotten way worse than it’s been the past few months. We don’t have the smartest bunch out here
---
Does it do the same after you have been firing at the target for a few seconds to ",charge" the weapon? Maybe before it was applying ",full charge" damage all the time. Havent used the gauss mini,so not sure. But to my understanding damage is supposed to increase as you fire to act as a charge/spin up mechanic.
---
The gauss pistol was doing full charge damage in vats without charging it,not sure about the rifle. I think thats why the ",fixed" them, atleast thats what the patch notes said.
---
&gt; but the only solution for Bethesda at that point seems to be money.
---
The worst part is, for me the money isn’t even the issue, it’s the idea of paying money to basically skip playing the game. I’d happily pay for reasonably priced DLC or Season Pass where the content was reasonably achievable through playing the game, I can’t be the only one. Instead it’s like the options are either hundred of hours of grind that makes you want to slam your head on a wall, or pay to get the content instantly without actually playing at all, which, like, what’s the fucking point?
---
Lol awesome
---
Same. I was about to say *Tell me more about these Publix events*
---
I should be online around 7pm UK time if you will be online then??
---
Everyone just needs to relax and see what happens. they could offer triple score days and all kinds of things to alleviate the grind.
---
But there is a bit of hope. 
---
No one has reached another color on the board yet, a “chapter” if you must. It could maybe reset with the Xp required or even cap there. We don’t know yet.
---
Perhaps. I plan to test it myself as soon as I’m in a position where all of the weekly and the current dailies are done and only the repeatable is available.  That way the only score points I could earn would be the 100 for 10k XP (easy enough to see if that was what procced) and the ‘public events’.
---
Right, but we need *some* kind of hard evidence, because what I think is happening is exactly what you're saying. People are getting the delayed or early SCORE payouts for the weeklies, or the repeatable xp, and they are attributing that to the event. Then those people go around calling others stupid and dismissing valid concerns because "I KNOW IT GIVES SCORE I GOT IT"
---
Thanks. Totally forgot about how they do that
---
Of course
---
Gotcha, thank you
---
Thanks! That worked
---
What does that have to do with anything, is Reddit account age suddenly linked with your play time? Do you genuinely think just because a Reddit account is 10 days old they can't have a valid opinion?
---
You're the reason this post was made, because you're some fanboy trying to turn a discussion about Bethesda not caring about you into how old my Reddit account is.
---
Really? I did. Easy aluminum for daily and topped of my weekly gather building supplies
---
Sadly, almost all of the Gaming industry have been this way for far too long, at one point companies made games with tons of content and additions to the game were never a reason to stop playing due to boredom. The trend is to make a basic mostly working game, add things way too slowly over vast, extended periods of time, ignore bugs while killing exploits with the veracity of a T-Rex and cash shop your way to victory. Sad state indeed. 
---
I used to believe Bethesda was different; I no longer get the feels anymore from them.
---
Mine is bugged out where he says something about rescuing his baby brother it doesn’t give me a way point.
---
everyday?
---
You're welcome, it catches a few of us off guard at times.
---
Because people need to kill the queen in .2 sec
---
I am mainly annoyed that I won't get Frankie as a random vendor. Throughout my 200 hour playthrough I tried to do everything "perfectly" since there is no reloading and I dislike replaying games. This was literally the last quest and the last location that I had to do to get "100%" and it fucks me over...
---
The only assumption I'm making here is that the increase of 25 exp is gonna stay, i cant see it getting lower, as well as the fact that weekly and daily averages will be the same. I'm not freaking out, I'm opening your eye, you are welcome.
---
video prefered, with the challenges tracked so we can eliminate if it is/is not the challenges popping instead
---
I'll have to test when i get home.  This is concerning.
---
&gt;  You sound like somebody that played the game once when it first released and never picked it up again

I like that this is a comeback for literally any time someone criticizes the game. 700+ hours, IS My opiNiOn VaLID eNoUGh YeT?

---
As someone with a BOS character I'm looking forward to this, but am trying not to get my expectations up
---
Just another rant by someone so entitled that they think a game is a complete failure because it doesn't function like they think it should......
---
Can't argue with any of that, bang on mate. Everyone is panicking too early without knowing all the information.
---
Attach another set of stairs going DOWN from the highlighted (top) foundation but NO OTHER foundations at the base of the new stairs. This MAY allow you to delete the floating foundation. If that does not work, you will have to move your camp module slightly to have everything revert to a blueprint, then delete.
---
I think you need to get off reddit for now buddy. It’s obviously not really helping how you feel
---
It could of been so much more simple like convert 1000 of x ammo for 250 y ammo, all the menu scrolling back a forth for such small amounts of ammo is just a waste of time messing around with.
---
Hehe magic weapon, enjoy it while you can it will probably be fixed one day. I will enjoy being god until it’s fixed.
---
I think adrenaline being borked is a bigger deal and am kind of miffed this ammo kerfuffle is taking the shine off of that fact..
---
That would be the only answer I have. 
---
So its giving you the warning: "Exceeds Maximum Build Count"?
---
&gt;you’re a new account most likely trying to start shit on the sub 
---
Holy christ I do not know why the mods bother setting up AutoMod to not allow certain age accounts to post if you idiots are still going to use it as an excuse for why people complain
---
&gt; nothing’s changed why are you here
---
Too much hope in Bethesda. Too much hope the players would stop being braindead and understand Bethesda does not deserve to be praised. Yes you have no idea what it's like to try and stick with this game through the BETA, take a break and just come back to the same shit. You really do have no idea.
---
From the Riding Shotgun event, seems like that the chance for a legendary spawn is high in that event now.
---
For me I noticed it’s like a 30 percent chance I will actually get score form it
---
Yup
---
Are we sure this is rewarding SCORE because of the event and not because of the XP you get from the event?
---
At least you can go complete some daily's for atoms to feel better.
---
*oh wait*
---
This update is bethesdas way of reducing players ability to recieve atoms among other disadvantages with minimal kick back.  Now you have to chew your way through junk boxes and caps rewards to get cosmetics you would have bough from the store with your free earned atoms.  These are items you would have bought as sets, and probably while they were on sale meaning your money goes further.
---
Now YOU pay the game mechanic atoms to level up to an intentionally lofty goal.  It's a nice game mechanic and contributes to a better experience because of the look and feel, but I dont like how they removed pre-existing benefits.
---
Can't say I have had any such issues and I have been playing exclusively on steam since Wastelanders dropped. Its a real shame that Bethesda support couldn't resolve it for you, have you also dropped a steam ticket in to see if there is an issue on their end?   
---
Hope you get it sorted.
---
Same here during that sale.  Oh well.
---
That wasn’t really my point.  
---
I’m saying they’ve structured the pass so if you make it in later than a few weeks you’re forced to use atoms if you want to hit higher levels.
---
The fundamental issue that I’m seeing is that while yes, when we feedback loudly enough some of the most egregious bugs and problems get fixed, if you look at the sheer volume of new problems that spring up in every major patch and ATX update you realise that Beth will never be able to catch up and get ahead of it. They need actual quality control on their content creation ASAP.
---
Might be a idea to state which platform, Xbox, PC and PS4 get different challenges
---
Most of the people?  Where are you getting "Most" from?  Can you provide a source?
---
That only occurs if you actually have placed one or it is stored, but since neither of those are true, it seems to be a bug.
---
But let me tell you, you aren't missing out on anything by not having it, it sadly is complete garbage.
---
Works great for missiles and 40 cal grenades.
---
Got them to
---
Going to get downvoted to Hades for this but: no one is forcing you to do the board.  It's only an addition to the game, nothing more.
---
Why didn't they just say completing any event gives you X score points.Then they could say Public events give you X times the number of people in your party or total number of people participating. Another nice thing would be getting X for completing dailies. Any time you get a double reward for doing something that seems to be a chore I'd think would instantly become more tempting.
---
EDIT: Throw challenges on top of that and you apease solo and group play.
---
Exactly. I have 4 characters with different builds allowing all the weapons to be stored on specific characters. This allows perks to increase damage as well as reduce weight.
---
I've tested it and confirmed it, carrying 100k in 5mm and dropping them, I gained 10 pounds in carry weight.
---
possibly a database/localization error or some sort?  Google tells me 'sama' in japanese means a title like Mr or Mrs... so maybe it was meant to be a title of some sort but the database field was messed up and defaulted to its (if you're not in japan, then wrong) title?
---
If you join my public team and just afk in your camp, I actually still get that bonus regardless of your involvement. I couldn't care less.
---
You and a lot of other players are just so fucking antisocial it is baffling that you play a co-op multilayer game.
---
No have 141
---
Perhaps we need a dataminer to explain if this data is even visible to us.
---
That said, while the end section of the board certainly defies their "2 hours a day" estimate, the current pacing hardly seems inconsistent with the monetization schemes they've used in the past.  If you do everything perfectly and put in a lot extra grind time for XP (and theoretically Public Events, but we have no idea about those), you can make it to the end without paying.  But the vast majority would have to pay.  This wouldn't be an effective scheme if anyone could casually reach the end.
---
I'm confused to what your saying and is there Amy proof its coming to game pass or is this just another false rumour that occurs 30 times a week?
---
TY for this. Do you know if both unlock at the same time or if you have to go through the Christmas list first, then Halloween or vice versa?
---
\*\*\*\*Disregard, I just saw this answered below. Again, TY for the info.
---
yeah tried everything and just ended up deleting my base and now time to rebuild
---
The preview image for the clean sink in The Legendary Run shows a sparkling clean, seat on, toilet, next to it, I don't remember seeing it as a SCORE reward, so its entirely probable there is a new building bundle coming soon, fingers crossed.
---
Can't have you looking like an idiot now can we?! HeHe.
---
I personally LOVE the game now. It’s a lot more stable than when I used to play it and the core gameplay loop is fun (at least in my eyes). I don’t come across any game breaking bugs but bugs don’t usually change my opinion on a game. A lot of people on these subreddits just to complain about every little thing. And even though the ammo converter is worth complaining about, I think the game is much better than it ever was before. 
---
EDIT: and now that stuff like player stealing and vending machines are fixed there is no real worry to losing your stuff for good
---
Currently levelling up a new str character for this reason. Perception maxed on my main for commando/rifleman/bows and now starting up a strength maxed out build for shotguns/heavy guns/melee. Got some nice weapons already lined up so can't wait to get to 50 to use them.
---
Funny starting from scratch again too and realising how much you rely on the likes of marsupial, can't even jump up a step.
---
"Challenges" as a concept is totally absurd and counter to anything enjoyable in a game like Fallout.
---
"Go do completely random and pointless crap to waste your time to get a reward you want."
---
There are tons of different ways to reward players from actually playing the game and doing interesting things for SCORE. They could go nuts with character specialization, numerical skill points, camp progression systems, in-game world changing "events" like raiders take over an area - you can come up with low hanging fruit and dynamic game systems that would encourage people to trade and exist in the world, then tie the rewards to any or all of those things. 
---
Imagine being a gunsmith character specialization where you ALWAYS had a use for various junk materials to increase your skill and trade what you make to other players? It would be amazing. Your gameplay loop would be trading for rare gun crafting materials with other players who aren't gunsmiths, then selling what you make to players who can't make it themselves. 
---
Or you actually have to manage your camp and progress it through gaining rare resources or settlers. Or even a mode where you PLAY as a settler (think Nuclear Winter, but not PVP, only PVE) and you load into a different map or instance for a scavenger run. 
---
There are so many different ways to re-purpose what they already have in the game to allow for progression. "Go kill 5 scorched" challenges isn't the way to engage players.
---
I like to comment drunk sometimes.
---
congrats, you thought of a joke that has been around since launch
---
I only need to kill 4 legendary creatures do finish all the weeklys and i completed all the daylis
---
&gt;The going theory is that with just challenges alone
---
And that includes the Nuclear Winter challenges, right?
---
I’m pretty sure they should’ve just reset and it’s now 12 pm est for resets
---
I only have 3 CHR on my main, so I'm limited to level 1 cards - my go to share at the moment is **Born Survivor**
---
Working on a CHR based alt though
---
&gt;’*As long as people defend Bethesda for not adding Text Chat to an online multiplayer game then* ***I won't say the game has gotten better***.’
---
This is where you directly state that you refuse to acknowledge any positive changes in the game, until your specific demand is met. 
---
That’s what indicates your toxic bias. 
---
Had you said even something as basic as ‘While there have been some improvements to the game, the lack of text chat is still a serious flaw’, this would be different. 
---
Clinging to an extremist position does nothing to sway anyone to your viewpoint. All it does is entrench those that already share your viewpoint. 
---
In short, your post isn’t designed to generate valid discussion or potentially influence anyone. It’s designed to be divisive and hostile. 
---
I’ve given harsh critiques of this game and Bethesda before. But it’s been done in a fair manner. 
---
I get your frustration. You’re simply building up walls and barriers instead of promoting positive change. 
---
When you discount and ignore everything positive someone has done and only dwell on the shortcomings, you discourage them from wanting to make improvements.
---
Criticism needs to be fair, honest and balanced to have any positive and lasting impact.
---
Perhaps you’ll realize that eventually.
---
Alright!
---
Because, it''s (pardon my language) **f$%king tedious**.
---
I scrapped 1800 .38 to max out the 2000 ammo points, so I could collect my 240 fusion cells. It took 15 minutes to do so, even spamming the multiple menus you have to go through to do it.
---
This is the only answer. NO. No cheaters with mods. I believe most console players would quit if crossplay was enabled as the market and everything else would go down the toilet.
---
Wait what?!
---
Mine are completely random sometimes I will have them in the morning and get them again at night it's wierd
---
Exactly. And he doesn’t even see or acknowledge his own toxic bias. He also just tried to claim he didn’t ‘ignore’ and of the changes. 
---
Guess he didn’t read what he wrote.

I know It's hard to tell what's real, So yes. Fallout 76 is coming to gamepass. Everything else just acts to muddy the waters
---
They shouldn’t need to bow to anything, this shouldn’t of been a situation that happened in the first place. Triple A game company remember ? LOL
---
My guess is if it was set up as a container somehow dupers could use it for duping tho only ammo I guess. Or maybe the devs are sadists?
---
Yeah. I actually encountered a different issue with camps I haven’t included. Last night I went to my camp I’ve had for two months. I know very well that I could always change the wall type, like from solid wall to doorway. I do this daily. However, last night it wouldn’t let me change the door with the change/replace option. I even switched to a private server and it was still not letting me change the wall type. I then stored the wall, put it right back, and at that point it would let me change them out again for all walls in the camp. I thought it was gonna bs a huge issue but it was an easy fix
---
Congratulations! The ammo still hasn't given me 1 pound.
---
it reset but it completed 3 of them despite me just now getting on today.. no NW auto complete bug cool. good stuff beth
---
Don't we all!... *hiccup*
---
How can I give you advice if I don't know the scenario?
---
No problem!!
---
I'm not describing myself? That's pretty profound man.
---
Doesn’t take much to make me look like an idiot sometimes lol
---
You always have the option to buy your way to the end if you don't make it to 100 in time
---
I'd crossed the river west of the Billings Homestead, across from Sunshine Meadows, and across from Point Pleasant.  Going north I climbed the mountain north of Vault 51, but it wasn't like I had to wiggle through geometry or anything, it just didn't stop me like it usually would.
---
Refridgerators and Repair kits... lol
---
Beth: *moves bulking process to a new camp terminal*
---
That’s cool, I guess. Got so used to farming. Is there any negative, like if I absolutely don’t drink any water/food?
---
This is achieved by playing NW and then playing Adventure mode in the same game session.
---
And has been since NW was introduced.
---
Well, first, I’ve already seen the math done by other people at least 3 times already, so. I mean your presentation on the math looks exactly the same as some of the other ones I saw. My eyes weren’t opened up any more than they were the last 3 times I saw It. 
---
Second, that assumption makes a big difference.  We don’t know:
---
* Will we reach a cap (e.g. 2500)
---
* Will reaching new chapters change the points (for the better or for the worse)
---
* Will they fix the issue where we aren’t getting SCORE for doing public events (making the progress faster)
---
Your assumption is a big one, and in fact is the basis on what’s causing people to freak out.  You can’t say that’s the “only” assumption when that’s the premise of why the grind looks bad to begin with.
---
So, what buttons do they have to press to turn that feature on?
---
&gt;tell Bethesda
---
After the stupid impossible grind they've implemented? Fuck them, enjoy the xp

This was my exact thoughts. There isn’t going to be an incentive to play together anymore. And I have been enjoying seeing everyone at the events. It’s a shame that there isn’t any endgame for players who are high level. I’m only level 76 and still haven’t finished my build but after that I don’t know what I’m gonna do.
---
That’s strange. The games way too messed up in some certain areas at the moment for me to enjoy it. Generally without at least half the bugs I’d be able to enjoy the game
---
Can you not scrap all at once? (I know nothing about it)
---
I got the first reward box from tier 2 and it gave me enough to finish the scrap weekly challenge...stonks
---
If you were unable to trade a B2525 Handmade you simply were not trying in the right place. On the m arket trading sub you could get almost anything you wanted for that item. 
---
But if there is nothing for your current build that you really want, just keep that awesome commando gun and see if you want to respec or start a new commando character. I traded a B2525 Combat Rifle last year, got great stuff for it, but then started a new profile that could’ve used that beauty and really wished I still had it. 
---
Whatever you do, don’t let that Handmade go cheap. It has tremendous value as a trade item.
---
I ditched Destiny when the first season came around, but just started playing again. In 2 weeks of regular casual gameplay I'm at level 44 out of 100. It's completely fine there.
---
&gt; not counting gravity,

Oh gravity, my old enemy.
---
What button does literally every other online game press? Why do you people seriously keep defending them for this lmao, you're literally ignoring the fact that it's illegal and that still doesn't change anything
---
What's your excuse for why a 360 game had chat support but a game from 2019 doesn't
---
The more the merrier.
---
Sounds like anarchist propaganda but ok 😎
---
Tell me it so I can make a continuation to my original XP glitch I posted that 12,631 people have watched

If we're lucky maybe they'll fix adrenaline perk in 2
---
You mean, "spend 15 minutes converting 700 syringes to **40** 5.56"?
---
I meant overall. Like why is duping viewed in such a bad way?  How does it affect you personally? Why do people get mad at it? Bethesda is making stuff jarder for everyone for literally no good reason.
---
Sometimes i wonder what goes through peoples heads.    There is no reason to reinvent the wheel.   All they had to do was tweak the vendor process as described above and voila!    Ammo converter and praise.   Collect your paycheck and sleep soundlessly.    Maybe get a promotion tomorrow.   But nope, you had to be "original", "unique" ... "artsy".    
---
Oh well, back to the F/o community and we'll do our own ammo trading...
---
This is a bug being widely posted about on /r/fo76.
---
It's a bug, looks to be from the update yesterday.
---
I was reluctant to post it here incase I inadvertently make Beth aware of it before folks who missed out can recoup the rewards (like myself!) 😛
---
Mine just updated.. ive got 4 new ones, but 3 that I completed yesterday still (Gold Star / Kill a legend / level up). 
---
So thats 1k SCORE ill be missing out on today.
---
If I were to guess, it will probably be a bundle on the atom shop (now that gaining free atoms have been nerfed)
---
I'm running that on an alternate character but I don't have much on him as I just started that when wastelanders.came out and Ive been playing my main for a while. Its a heavy weapons/2 handed melee build.
---
Shotgun build here...  they really only ever work exceptionally well in VATS.  You avoid the damage bug (where enemies appear to regain some lost health) and it just seems to deal more damage in VATS.  It's dumb, but it works
---
Well shit, every time I think I'm done with Fo76, it sucks me back in... Time to play some NW!
---
The ammo generator is not garbage, that thing is awesome even if it generates ammo slowly 
---
Think you are thinking of the new ammo converter.
---
All these math never account for the repeatable challenges,because they're too variables.  But in 10 weeks they pile up some nice points,specially for the over privileged unyielding crowd.
---
I appreciate it.. I submitted a ticket to steam, another online ticket to bethesda, and posted on their support f76 site. It just my luck, I took two days vacation to try out this game and wala got hit with this.. I wonder if my wife has bethesda's phone number so she can make me do more home projects vs gaming like i was 16 again :)
---
yep.. 3/7 auto completed same here. screw rank 100 i guess
---
Lunchbox reward from legendary run, they give the team buffs like 50% less Hunger or thirst

Summer Updates, coming in January 2021
---
I walked by the observatory the forger day fully expecting hostile robco robots but I was pleasantly surprised to see the construction protectrons drilling away. I wasn’t sure what it meant but after seeing the summer update video I guess the BoS sent them 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt;if you don't like playing 
---
Thats a purdy strawman there. I do like playing. I just have different priorities to people who heavily engage the challenge system as the norm. I don't even mind doing a reasonable number of challenges if the cosmetics are nice; thats a cool Chicken Coop and secret door. What I mind, and should be plainly obvious, if that unless I want to engage every single day doing similar repetitive tasks, for over two whole months, I won't get anywhere worthwhile in progressing. And that if OPs math is write I'll still likely have to pay out for Atoms to 'finish off' missed days.
---
Something needs to change honesty.  They’ve seen that they can get away with putting out small bits of content and locking it away with grind, and they’re probably just going to keep milking the playerbase until they just leave.
---
After the Free States quests I kept waiting for the game to give me a way to use the Scorched Beast lures they go on about. Never happened. A couple weeks ago I did the event that uses them for the first time, had no idea they do actually get used. (Played since launch)
---
I wish you could get a portable one to plop down for regular SBs and the SBQ so melee characters don't have it so rough.
---
No quests reward score at all.
---
You mean the Sunnytop Ski Lanes athletics course exp farm that nets you unlimited exp, caps, aid items and grenades?
---
That’s from the website **Heuristic Integrated Solutions - Application Software System**.

He can pull any data he wants at any time, without the need for any corroboration or fact checking.
---
A Campfire Tales had more people than Fasnacht. Never seen it where there weren’t any seats left by the fire.
---
Wait: Are people actually using the 'Roleplay' Public Team option to actually Roleplay? Or are you just rambling?
---
Either way: Yes a 'Choose faction' option in the 'Roleplay' Public Team category would be fantastic! That would be 1 step closer to an actual 'Factions' system.
---
Same here. I wasnt in NW. Was in my camp and 3 of the challenges auto completed as well.
---
Tell Bethesda...
---
I've been playing solo and have loved the game so far. I got kidnapped the other day after drinking nuke cola quantum🤣. I'm in no rush to level up, I just love wandering and scavenging.
---
Walk it off !!
---
There’s also a note inside the tent near the Construction Protectrons.
---
This is gonna be a new Community Event along the lines of Project Clean Appalachia where we rebuild ATLAS in preparation for the BoS’s arrival. They revealed it in a trailer they put out today
---
I think we established that Adrenaline isn't working anymore, which it turns out is a big contributor of my damage.
---
No! You scrap it in qtys of 10-30 at a time. And that's **3** menu screens, and a confirmation you click through for each of those transactions.
---
They did say that public events would reward EXP earlier but then *incidentally* left it out of the actual patch notes. It's almost as if they realised that would make it too easy.
---
&gt; So, this breaks down to: ’Until Bethesda adds this one specific feature I refuse to acknowledge anything positive they’ve done at all.’
---
If you take one small thing I said and ignore the rest then sure
---
&gt;That’s a very limited and extremely biased viewpoint.
---
So is saying Bethesda has changed when the title is literally from a post saying the changes they would make that still have not occurred
---
&gt;You complain about ‘fan bois’
---
I was just pointing out some freak with nothing better to do was literally downvoting every comment that was positive when I first made the post. But sure, I guess you literally only read the word fan boy and got mad about it.
---
&gt;That toxic bias damages any validity of your argument.
---
So do all the people like you trying to act like I'm a troll without a valid opinion just because I'm criticizing a game they like
---
&gt;anytime giantpunda and I agree on something, that’s rare
---
That's sad, I don't know who you people are and you're acting like some known name. Christ how big is your ego.
---
Really, you're seriously downvoting every new comment I make in this thread? You are pathetic. It's obvious because you just can't help yourself from refreshing the page and replying to every new comment.
---
Wonder if the Gift Wrap Hunting Rifle is available to get. Might just have to snag that real quick
---
Id 100% prefer to pay for a battle pass i can complete at a reasonably pace, my own pace. Rather than one I have to grind to finish.  
---
It being free doesn't mean its free from criticism.  Especially because in the future Bethesda said they might add extra rewards (if you have fallout first i believe or pay more i forgot.)
---
The meat of the Fortnite battle pass is rank 1-100. The extra gold skins they offered last season were just bonuses for people who could grind it out. My kids are very limited in Xbox time, with only 1:30 to 2 hrs per day. Plus one of them splits his time between 76 and Fortnite and he was able to get 175 in the battle pass last season and is already rank 50 with the season just starting 2 weeks ago.
---
I wish 76 would have that kind of quick progression, with "extra" stuff like those gold Fortnite skins for those players who want to grind beyond rank 100. Instead, I went to bed last night feeling good about hitting rank 7 on the SCORE board, but woke up realizing that this time next week, I'll be at 12 at best and got bummed out.
---
You wanna quote where I said it was a complete failure?
---
Lol I for the most part agree with you, but bro you are next level super fucking toxic about it like chill a bit.
---
One of the challenges is every 10k xp you get 100 score, and its repeatable maybe that's bugging out ?
---
It's official then. You gotta switch from a flamethrower to a bow build.
---
Oh, and grab yourself some tights.
---
It’s saying you can’t place it in camp because it will take you over the camp budget allowance. This happens regularly for me with lights.. just delete something in camp then try to place it again.
---
I’m not defending anything. I asked you what the required steps would be. 
---
If you’re going to suggest that the task is easy, then that implies you understand how it would be implemented. 
---
And it’s not illegal. The ADA only says there need to be ‘reasonable accommodations’. You’re sounding like the Karens refuse to wear masks and want to go into a store that requires them anyways. 
---
**Cite the law or ADA excerpt that states that an online multiplayer game must have a text chat feature.**
---
Not rambling at all (although if you know me the that's an appropriate question) I do think it would be super immersive and quite simple to have the team setup be:  Roleplay &gt; Faction Selection &gt; Accept
---
It absolutely is. I earned it a few hours ago. Been slowly working my way through the rewards. Only need the Glowing Skeleton outfit from Halloween, and the Nuclear Winter beanie and fur lined jacket and jeans from Christmas.
---
The perk fuckup shouldn't have happened at all.
---
They intended for this fuckup.
---
Erryday
---
I quoted your own words, dude.
---
Yes i noticed this as well. Feels a bit op actually
---
You’re entitled to your opinion, but as someone who doesn’t plan on spending money this isn’t something I can ever support. Paying for privilege to earn rewards doesn’t sit well with me. I like that everyone can participate.
---
Aw, don't say that haha. I've got your back!
---
yeah logged in at 12. 
---
see if that makes a difference

I'll soon have to make a to do list in priority order to make sure i don't forget a daily thing ...

hell, even the one from the pitt dlc from fallout 3 was better lol
---
Nope that’s not it have a crap ton of build limit

Hacks aren’t even an issue unless you’re in NW, even then it’s minimal.
---
Everything was fine after a reboot in safe mode and a database rebuild. I’ve never had that happen before, guess I’ve been lucky.

I didn’t know that but thank you lol
---
Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
These three autocompleted for me as well. Are they autocompleted for everybody?
---
Piss off. I made a post about how Bethesda said they were going to have better communication and they still don't and idiots like you have turned it into my account age and how I apparently said Bethesda never changed the game.
---
Thank you, voice of morals and all that is right (not sarcasm, I appreciate you)
---
Yeah I saw that too, looks like all of the weekly ones were doing it. I suppose it could've been the xp repeatable but I'll have to keep a better eye out tonight.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts!
---
It has to do with the camp/workshop.
---
Flat woods monster!
---
You were partially right. We are getting accidental rewards, just from nuclear winter instead of seasons LoL.
---
Nope, not for me at least. It was working as intended for me earlier: 'Anti armor - +10% Damage while aiming' Western Revolver. It does the job well enough: 89 base damage (Refined Receiver) plus the 10% while aiming would be around 105 damage output which is great for a revolver. So yeah it's working as intended on my end.
---
What about meat week thoo??
---
It has to do with the camp/workshop
---
&gt; I still watch this sub in hopes of seeing people post about improvements, but the only thing people compliment fo76 on is the nice community. I had high hopes for this game but it's become a super grindy cash grab.
---
It's sad how relatable this comment is but according to everyone I'm in the wrong and just a troll who doesn't know what they're talking about
---
I love this&lt;3
---
Hopefully I can convince my partner to give it a try now. I'm on playstation but she plays Xbox. Here's to hoping one day (it'll never happen), it'll be crossplay.
---
God damn! I was about to ask if only playing friday nights was enough to get to rank 100. Im never gonna make it i think.

Hmm. Show me your channel

Project paradise no

Its a skin for that specific armor I'm going to guess wood

Wasn't that how they always were?

In what universe do the people complaining about bugs and issues get complained at themselves for complaining?
---
&gt;that's been posted 100 times before
---
It's almost like
---
**Nothing Changes**
---
Same
---
Exactly my thoughts as well. That would truly please the Roleplay community. It would be such an easy addition too.
---
I kinda wish this was delayed until it was able to be rolled out with something new to do. Or at least that public events awarded score like Bethesda said they would.
---
I’m a melee build, so although I can shoot her my bullets only do 1 damage or 2 with a critical and half the time I miss because she’s zipping around the map.
---
Except this pass in theory will require you to pay for atoms or grind atoms if you dont have any to complete the battle pass if you miss a couple of days of play time. Thats my entire point. Either way its a cash grab. I'd rather pay the cash up front than let them try to trick me into spending cash.
---
I was in a game the other night with someone actively using the cryo and she did stay down much longer that way.
---
I haven't played Skyrim in a few years but from what I remember you needed Dragonrend because you're longest range attack was a bow and arrow.
---
We heard you hate chewing bubblegum and placing doors to get atoms.
---
So we added an entirely new way to earn points to get atoms.
---
Now you can chew bubblegum and place doors to get xp to earn towards getting atoms. 👍
---
Edit:  This system is "how do we make atoms harder to get" disguised as "making challenges  more fun to do", as evidenced by the fact that _we're still doing the same tired challenges we did last week_.
---
no. before update 20 they always renewed at 11AM EST
---
Really Bethesda? 🙄
---
it will only be adressed when it causes bethesda to loose actual money
---
Yeah, I saw this last night with my instigating Plasma Caster. It is supposed to do a total of 280 damage base. But on a full health target it as only doing like half that. Not a low health build either.
---
It made my VATS pistol character's Gauss weapon pretty unremarkable.
---
I wasn’t disagreeing with you.
---
As others have said, even if you come in at the start you’ve still got to grind a couple hours every day to complete the whole season by playing. Everybody else, and especially as you said those who come in after the first few weeks, will be forced to use atoms for higher levels that they should be able to realistically earn through play.
---
My point, aside from the above, was that I’m not even against paying for new content. I’m against paying to *not* experience content.
---
They did not autocomplete for me, none of the challenges did. However, the 5/5 challenges gave rewards when only 3/5 objectives were completed.
---
The free rewards are insulting? Not to mention the free cosmetics.
---
Or rather, just reapply your string changes for mods like componentparts and iconsortingtags as you're meant to do with each patch, and that'll sort out the failed lookups without losing mod functionality. Had the same issue, and this sorted it all out without issue.
---
Yeah, the usual frustrated gamer idiotism.
---
Maybe it is bugged - but having completed all my dailies and weeklies last night, I received absolutely zero SCORE this morning despite completing:
---
I mean it says skins so
---
they're doing it on purpose.. gotta buy those atoms to get ranks now
---
You know I wish I had as much time as Bethesda whom clearly don't even play their own games. I think we would probably see things get added in a bit differently. Don't get me wrong I think the system is great, the chore behind it is frustrating. Not only that I don't really have anyone to play with, I'm a solo player as it is and just that grind alone is enough. I'm level 156 and sadly still rocking only stock lever action rifle. As much as I played there hasn't been a weapon I've seen in vendors, from trading script to a weapon that suits me. So the struggle for me is real compared to some others whom can take down a scorchbeast in a few minutes, where it still takes me 10-20 minutes.
---
There is also issues I've seen as also a Fallout 1st Member - There is just so many broken things in the world, such as items no re spawning after days of actively playing, sometimes the world doesn't fully load so you see places with missing objects like pool tables, etc.
---
I just wanted this game to be like any other $60 game, play at your own pace.
---
I had been on last night and just like DnD Roleplay (it's hit or miss) but I got into an excellent dialogue with some kid, idk from where but by God if he didnt stay in character until he said it was bed time. "At ease soldier"
---
That sounds horrible. You'd think it would be faster to farm the mats to make more ammo in that time span
---
Dr teeth 69r md
---
Totally agree with this being a big issue. It’s absurd how often I miss a 95% vats shot with enemies literally right in front of the barrel. I now just always shoot twice, expecting the first shot to be a complete dud
---
Yeah, go hit the bars, go to a baseball game, maybe a concert... there's plenty of other fun stuff to do!
---
- Yeah, I chose one point to address. Why did that trigger you so much?
---
- I replied to your comment, not your post. That makes a huge difference.  They have changed many things. They haven’t yet changed everything they addressed. And they never gave a timetable.  
---
- That’s not the only place you made that reference. And assuming that anyone that disagrees with you is a ‘fan boi’ is also toxic and counterproductive. It’s a sign that you are unwilling to consider any other viewpoint. And that’s a horrible character flaw. Unless you’re a career politician. 
---
- I never said your opinion was invalid. I said that your toxicity was damaging the validity of your position. 
---
- I literally named the person you were replying to. That wasn’t some implication that you should know who either of us are out of that context. 
---
Yes, Bethesda needs to make more changes. But your caustic attitude is not helping that direction. 
---
You get more flies with honey than vinegar, kid. But if ranting makes you feel better, go for it.
---
I never said anything about your account age? I’m just simply saying you’re getting mad at anyone who has a differing opinion and even slight praise for making the game better than it was at launch. I don’t see why anyone wants to continually get mad at other people’s opinions on a subreddit for a game some people actually enjoy
---
I have no choice, adrenaline is broken..
---
I have only one character. Been playing since launch. Level 456. Since I unlocked my gauss minigun, I am a mix/hybrid between a commando, and a heavy gunner. With all heavy gunner perk cards maxed, and all commando w/ tank killer maxed. 4 charisma for lone wanderer, 3 endurance for fire proof, 3 agility for action boy/adrenaline, 9 luck for bloody mess, and the two perk cards for mutations. Long story short, I switch from heavy gunner to commando every day. And it’s great.
---
Yeah, back to dumping .38 at train stations again...
---
Did I mention that it's **4** additonal menus to buy the ammo you want, as well, lol
---
What I don't understand is why this "reason" to keep playing the game is so completely disconnected from the game. Dr. Evil Who What Now? Why the hell would I care about chasing him down across the... galaxy?
---
What does this have to do with FO76 and Appalachia? Earn a weird space suit... um. Okay. But can we talk more about the giant evil bat creature and crazy Enclave experiments that are a danger to the entire world... or is that just done.
---
thats not that good for xp actually. its ok for stims and caps, but the time to xp ratio is pretty bad.
---
Same!! I didn’t get 1000 score from one challenge. Completely bugged
---
I get no credit are manually completing them. Not sure which is worse.
---
No I won't...
---
It needs to be changed to 1000, not 100. It forces to to buy the Atoms required because no one can play 12 hours a day in order to get the additional score required for Rank 100. What a joke.
---
The best thing about the converter?
---
The ammo bin animation...
---
Dumbest thing about the ammo converter?
---
That you have the option to lock it...
---
The terminal interface is fine, but it just seems like it went sideways somewhere from concept to completion.
---
And some dailys are tied to NW which I do not and will not play!
---
How exactly do you go about earning them? Is it xp based like they previously were?
---
30%...yikes
---
Huh?
---
Craft/scrap is the best way to learn mods
---
I’ve read everything you’ve posted in this thread. 
---
Again, the fact that I disagree with your presentation doesn’t make me ‘dense’.  That’s an exceptionally myopic viewpoint.
---
Did you even checked yet? Like look at the ammo converter, the bigest thing everybody was waiting for. What we got is like it was designed by an underpaid intern who never played a videogame before. Or look at the fact that they made little to non effort to convert the old challenge system to make the new score challenges. They are not hard, they are timeconsuming chores, barely in the realm of their promise of you can get score by just playing. And I'm definitely not gonna complain if I indeed not gonna need to do them anymore in 2 weeks, because I will be done with the season by then.
---
This just looks everything that had been planned for addition in update 20... what
---
Yeah I know.. wait.. actually that works I have camo leather armor..I just need to rank up more to get everything. Thanks guys
---
See how long it takes to get thrown out the Supermarket by repeatedly coughing on people. It's fun!
---
As others have mentioned, I haven't gotten any SCORE from about 10 public events.
---
Did I studder?
---
None of the quantities are substantial. I can easily get similar quantities in minutes of gameplay.
---
Exactly! Well said. Between yesterday and today I played 8 hours. Completed 4 dailies each day. Completed Scorched Earth. Fully completed a major side quest. And now I have achieved enough SCORE points to meet LEVEL 1??!!  Sweet fancy moses man. I can't dedicate my entire damn life to this game!
---
Obviiusly they are hoping people will spend the 150 caps per level in 2 weeks when it becomes available.
---
Fucking Bethesda Money Grab.
---
Hopefully they won't complain about their headaches.
---
The guns lock up sometimes now for whatever reason. Happens to me when I use the gauss shotgun all the time. It’ll look like everything is fine, but you can’t run, change weapons, use stimpacks, etc. To fix this immediately, I just holster my weapon and then get it back out. And I think it fixes itself too if you use up the current ammo in the clip
---
This is the worst way to suggest a boycott
---
I got score from completeing scorched Earth earlier but I'm pretty sure it was just one of the weeklies triggering prematurely as they all seem to be doing for me.  Thinking it was either the kill legendary enemies one or the do events in a group one even though both are at 50 percent or less completion.
---
 I really doubt that scorched Earth gives 1,000 points for completion because that would push me through the ranks super fast.
---
Nah, the other 100 people that posted about this haven’t gotten the rewards
---
I’m not. Ty though
---
Some of the weeklies aren't rewarding points when completed. A buddy and I both tested the destroy various robots weekly and neither of us got the 1000 points.
---
Yes, the ammo converter. The ammo machine is the best thing you can buy for gold.
---
Wouldn't really matter if the challenges are tracked since they all are paying out points before they are even completed, at least for me they are.
---
Now you know the trick 😉
---
I understand theres an overwhelming amount of complaints about it. However, all it would take is one single sentence from a community manager to stim that flow. "We are aware that the ammo converter is a serious concern for most of the community and we are looking into ways to improve it." That's it. That reply would get stickied and then people would be so much happier.
---
I mean, you can get it to spawn now without the event. just a bit more rare
---
They may have tied it to base damage with the update. I used to see a 100+ increase.
---
Nice dodge. Now answer the question. 
---
I said ‘LAW ***OR*** ADA EXCERPT’.
---
There are plenty of non-US Laws that have to do with disability accommodations. Which is why I made that distinction. 
---
But you’re too focused on ‘being right’ that you missed that. 
---
Back to the point: **Cite The Law.** ***Regardless of which country.***
---
And I suggest you remain Civil. You may need to read the rules of this sub.
---
*Edit: Oops, looks like your post got removed. You still there, kid?*
---
*Nope, looks like he got banned. Maybe we’ll see him again in a few days.*
---
What about repeatable challenges ? Also you can buy progress with excess atoms gained by doing the season.
---
Please tell me the patriotic skin isn't just another stupid flag painted on it
---
No to mention most of the skins and rewards are recycled content. They are really showing us how much they care with this update.
---
Watch what you say about the Enclave, friend. We may have to pay you a visit soon...
---
I got to 7 in 3 hours. Wasn't even paying attention to the challenges. Just grinding like I normally do
---
Yes, just earn exp in NW. I made a post earlier today showing all the rewards and exp needed to unlock them.

Warframe is a F2P looter shooter where you can *easily* earn in-game MXT currency and purchase *everything* (except for Community Produced skins since youre paying their creator real money), as well as easily achievable goals. The game is amazingly well optimized, has rapid bug fixes released weekly, and looks amazing, with more visual updates released every year.
---
You can easily clear their Battlepass with **a few months/weeks to spare**, even if you play casually and miss days/weeks. And even if you miss *months* of the Battlepass missions, Warframe has a catchup mechanic that allows you to do *all previously missed Weeklies after you've finished all your current weekly quests*, meaning **even if you dont play for 10/11 months, you can still complete the entire Battlepass in a week** if you grind hard enough.
---
**All without paying a penny.** And Digital Extremes, the makers of Warframe, are doing *absurdly* well monetarily, even though their last few content updates have been buggy and lacking.
---
This is Greed on Bethesda's part. They could easily make it a better system that doesnt require real money to spend. Other companies have done better Battlepass systems without issue. This is one of the worst ones ive seen and it blows my mind.
---
I honestly like Fo76, and think most people are really unfair to it. Its gameplay loop is rocksolid, the gunplay is satisfying, and the world is amazing to explore. But holy shite their Battlepass is garbage and sorely needs to be reworked if theyre going to be actively removing our ability to gain MTX currencies in-game.
---
I only bought the chest piece and did 10 rolls for unyielding and got one 3\* with junk weight reduction, the problem is that my present unyielding 3\* has ammo weight reduction and I hardly ever carry junk with F1st.
---
So aside from better  DR/ER/RR I say it depends on what you are running now and how many modules you are willing to spend to get a good (or better) piece.
---
Same here. I was wondering why enemies felt so tanky and it was taking me longer. Im maxed out on adrenaline too. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
Took me by surprise to see him all the way out there
---
All I want to see now is a entire server take her down with just bows and arrows
---
Bro this is the same sub that stickied, guilded and upvoted a posted yelling at people not to come to the fo76 sub for fo76 questions just yesterday...
---
This sub is basically just as sterile as the Beth forums.  What you gotta underatand about fanboys is they play this game so much that if they admitted Beth has fucked up at every turn it would amount to them admitting they drink the kool aid.  Cognitive dissonance won't allow for that now would it?
---
I use this sub for news about the game - it's great for that.  Other than that this place is a shit show.
---
Yeah.  On the topic of paying to not experience content, Bethesda just released their “Summer” trailer which is just them stretching content that was supposed to come out yesterday.    
---
I think I may take a long break from this game again
---
You know whats funny? Both of these mentalities are why companies are allowed to get away with this shit. 
---
Can't complete it? Buy atoms shouldnt be a must for a lot of people. People have lives they shouldn't be punished for being alive.
---
Youre right people get locked out and that's the same mentality as buy atoms. It gives you incentive to buy the  pass. Both models are flawed. Just because one is less flawes doesn't mean it should be the one you're "okay" with spending atoms on to complete.
---
Agreed. Some posts feel like the purposefully omit this... there is no incentive though like karma or followers on youtube ...right?
---
They also dont take in to account that you can buy progress with excess "Atoms" gained during the grind.
---
Besides I dont really set my goals to get everything. That would be such a stressor it would make the game a chore. I would then probably lash out on Reddit ,I dont know 😅
---
I play for fun. Bethesda has to adjust the seasons a bit and the ammo thingy but okay I'm not pissing my pants for this. It is a game. A game I got very cheap and I dont feel the need to buy things from the atom shop.
---
How so?
---
You got them early. Many weeklies are awarding points at 3/5 objectives.
---
I’m not even getting SCORE points for completing weeklies. Like......why do I play this game?
---
9+10=21
---
so wait until after 12 to login now.
---
the fact auto compete is still a thing pisses me off
---
Its possible they were rewarded early. If you complete all the weeklies + the first set of dailies you earn just over 9000 score, which would put you around rank 10. If you're lower than that after completing them then you definitely got screwed.
---
Thank you
---
Are you sure it didn't award the score earlier? I had a couple of weeklies award score with 3 out if 5 objects completed.
---
No problem!
---
I gave you an upvote because, like you, I refuse to play NW. I’m a level 468 with close to 2,000 hours in and I won’t spend a second of my time on that game mode. Power to the peaceful!
---
I find the whole thing confusing and maybe a bit misleading.  The season info says "complete DAILY ***AND*** WEEKLY challenges".  I did five dailies yesterday and only got SCORE on two of them, and one of them barely gave me any points.  Now, I get scaling point acquisition so people can't just plow through it all in an hour or so, but if this is the pace I should expect to see for the foreseeable future, I can pretty much guarantee I'm not getting anywhere near 100, and I'll lose any reason to care about it.  I'm not the kind of person to expect everything just to be handed to me whenever I want it, but if you're going to do something like this, it has to be consistent, and it sure doesn't look anything close to consistent right now.
---
It is, right down to the exact amount you need to earn. Some people are earning both sets at the same time. Others are earning them in an alternating fashion. So, Halloween, then Christmas, and repeating. Regardless, so long as you're keeping track of what rewards you still need, you can keep playing Nuclear Winter until you get them all.
---
It's the universe where you get pissed off at everyone who comments on your post. Seriously man, calm down.
---
*You think Federal regulations keep you safe but all it does is cede power to bureaucrats*
---
At +25 required per level that's 2500 score points additional by the end. That's only 25 of the 10000xp challenges. I got at least 5 of those in the 3 hrs I played last night. Bunch of @#&amp;$#@ whiners around here. Just have fun with it. What do you want, play for one day after a content drop and be done? I'm not going to look it up, but it looks like we'll get enough free atoms through out the season to by at least a few levels at the end if need be.
---
Idk. I'm enjoying it. I haven't hit end game though. I play every few days for a couple hours. And most of that time I just spend running around looting stuff. I never played during beta or at launch and, quite frankly, think it's pretty alright.
---
Sure, there are improvements that could be made even for someone as casual as me (i.e. enemy/hit lag, some areas are just completely void of anything to really interact with, and I could always use more carry weight because I'm a loot whore). But yeah, I mean, if you don't like the game, and haven't for two years, don't play it. Nobody is forcing you to.
---
yeah. i was a huge fallout fan. played fallout4 until my download for 76 was done. played every day that beta was on and i have an above lvl200 character with op weapons and a few in the 150 range. bethesda use to be one of my favorite game producers. but they became vault tec
---
There is a possibility that there is a disability accommodation law that does make it a requirement in this kind of situation. However, I’ve never been able to find one and no one I’ve ever asked has been able to produce one. 
---
He dodged the question because he didn’t read what I actually wrote.  Which was amusing. 
---
I asked about laws **or** the ADA. He blasted back that he wasn’t talking about the US exclusively. And neither was I, since I said ‘law’ not ‘US Law’, lol.
---
Tell that to the guy with his dick stuck in the ammo converter.
---
Bullet-fone: Time is up, returning to main menu:  Press 1 to convert AmmoPoints into ammo. Press 2 to convert ammo into AmmoPoints.
---
I agree I don’t like seasons. I do know they need to make money though. I just don’t want to be forced to spend money and be locked out of content if I don’t.
---
I would have been all over the vault raids if this system existed. I think they need to add a microphone team start option. It works without it but some for of coms. would be nice.
---
Lol that's why I have the wanderer,the one that plays guitar
---
Preettttty fucking standard season pass. This is the entire point of season passes.
---
If I get there cool, if not oh well. I've leveled 3 times today so far, so either way I'm having fun.
---
I did them last night, completed them, but received no points.
---
the game seems to be quite laggy since the update so it could be that you have to wait for a few minutes and check the corpses again
---
probably wont work but worth a try
---
2 weeks in you can give atoms to buy the next rank.. but that’s just money grabs
---
We are saving humanity, unlike you free states children playing with toys you don't understand
---
the reason i ask to see it is because of that, while they are awarding at incorrect times, we would still see the challenge pop up at "3/5" or "xxx/10k exp" and that would aid in the testing.
---
say someone does what i suggest, and we see robots 3/5 pop and the score move, we dont know if the score is related to robot quest or encryptid.
---
now say someone does the above, but robot quest "1/5" pops, since we know that it takes 3/5 to give the reward we can eliminate that as being the source of the score, assuming the score bar moves.
---
Yeah it's not very good complicated sometimes rewards could be better
---
It's just complaining complaining and a bit more complaining to top it off
---
My math is actually spot on... can you tell me what’s wrong?
---
I sure did but thanks anyway
---
Finally able to use the AA FFR Lmg I have had stashed away for the last 150 levels.  Didn't want to prime it and regular 308 production sucks so it was just collecting dust. 
---
Set mine to 308 and now I get to use the thing.......well occasionally at least.  Lmgs tear through ammo even when they don't have faster fire, stupid fast with it.
---
It was probably your weekly being completed. I was in a fully bonded event team and got zero score from completing it.
---
How do you report a bug to Bethesda? Did any of you report this one?
---
The Wastelanders content segregated everyone and teams dissolved. Grinding for reputation/bullion took over, to a point where I just gave up because solo grinding gets old fast. Yesterday, I played on multiple teams, earned multiple Legendary Run rewards including the Ammo Converter, and had a lot of fun. Events are better attended, and finding teammates is now super easy like it should have been from the start.
---
I had never played Nuclear Winter before and was so confused as to why I was earning holiday items lol
---
You can swap for shotgun perks on the fly since both builds use STR (or heavy weapons, but without a dedicated build for it those are heavy af).
---
Also, use vats during flybys. When she’s right above you. My gauss minigun also deals shit damage at a distance, because the range is only 120.
---
Science!
---
I had a suspicion this was happening. Yesterday I had challenges award SCORE before they were completed. Today, I have 2 dailies checked off as complete yet they were not completed today not was I awarded SCORE. Even if they are holdovers from yesterday, then they are not dailies.
---
Yeah, they should give EVERYTHING FREE AND NOW!!!
---
i agree. 
---
it's nice that we have it but the implementation feels like a basic mod added to the game.
---
No I don’t think so, I did the objectives, they grayed out, but I didn’t get any points for them. I should’ve gotten 4000 score points yesterday plus the score points for doing all the dailies. I’m at level 7.
---
But the point is to be impossible so you buy/spend atoms. Not being a dick, but that’s their strategy.
---
Just play dude.. its fun and you get rewards no matter what. Its like any other standard season pass.
---
I have two 110+ characters and I feel ya.  I thought that the update would be something refreshing to the gameplay but I really changes nothing.  Starting to debate if the BP is even worth doing.
---
They’re treating this like a F2P game meanwhile I, and many others payed full price for a chore of a game.
---
Only played for a bit last night. Whats impossible about it?
---
Agreed. Thing is they can use excess atoms if they want to gain levels. But some dont want to decide between X and Y I guess.
---
As I said in other posts i play for fun. I dont take the game as a job or manufacture more drama with loaded questions and edgy sarcasm to get karma and YT followers. It all weapons of mass DISTRACTION (excuse the pun).
---
Let's learn to breathe:)
---
Upvoted because I agree and I dont think you deserve so many downvotes. It's ridiculous.
---
Wait impossible? I found the score system far more easy then before.
---
You mean that if you want to 100% the game, you have to grind?! *gasp*
---
Anyone else getting a glitch to where it adds a bunch of weight after converting?
---
I just don't get why they didn't do an equivalent of the Ammo Auto Constructor, something like: you select which kind of ammo you would like to obtain, then you load the converter with another kind of ammo and wait for it to slowly convert it.
---
You'll run into some problems with this build because stuff like mutations that improve unarmed, hurt rifles and vice versa. Especially if you decide to run junkies at some point. As for your build, you'll want one level of concentrated fire if you're doing rifles so you can do vats head shots. I'd also choose bloody mess over tormentor. It does a flat damage increase for both rifles and unarmed melee as opposed to sometimes crippling enemies with rifles only. I personally prefer adamantium skeleton and radicool over rad resistant as a melee. Getting crippled can be a pain when you're in melee range and that extra strength boost helps a lot when you are radiated, even if you don't run a low health build.
---
It's in the water section, took me a while to find it too.
---
No you can't hang up, you have to go through the whole conversation backwards in order to hangup
---
The math they did is very wrong.. You're thinking too much about it, just fucking play and get your rewards. Its fun and motivating if you stop thinking about it.
---
Yup, Starfield is going to be the same engine, same game design, same shitshow with a new coat of paint and animations.
---
I'm not buying it.
---
Definitely get herd! But empath? I guess if you have friends to play with and aren't solely relying on randoms to also have empath then grab it otherwise have fun taking more damage
---
Apart from the heinous time limited grind, they said the reason seasons are shorter than irl is so there can be a couple week break between seasons.
---
I have plenty of Ultracite .308 (18k) and an AA LD 15R LMG, that thing rocks.
---
But yeah, its kinda difficult to get normal .308 ammo for that bullet hose.
---
No worries man haha
---
This thing is absolutely the worst!
---
We already have a Tinker's bench.  A new and improved Tinkers bench that let's us scrap ammo to raw materials - lead, gun powder, steel, etc - and then make ammo as we always have would have been so much cleaner and user friendly. That's how it worked in NV and it was great. 
---
Also, an improved Tinker's Bench would have saved a ton of room in my CAMP.  This ammo click machine with tons of confusing steps that only takes precise amounts of ammo is cumbersome as heel (in more ways than one!).
---
I'll stick to just farming raw materials. 
---
Such a let down.
---
Haha, I think we all were a little confused yesterday!
---
everyone downvote so this can remain a secret
---
It's under the same banner as Bulk Crafting of anything really. If they do implement it, I'd imagine smelting would be included
---
But how much power? Enough to replace a Fusion Generator?
---
The idea of adding text chat?  Oh, I support that 100%!
---
It’s the method of delivery by the OP that is of concern to some people. 
---
If someone showed up to give you $100 cash but was yelling and screaming and insulting you the entire time they were handing you the money, a few people would probably have a problem with the vulgarity and screaming, even though they want and would take the money.
---
It can’t be completed by just doing dailys and weeklys. Somebody did the math
---
Was logged in when the dailies updated and only got 4 new ones.
---
Do I get a refund from when I spent $60?
---
And here's me wearing a bear cap using a pipe gun not even knowing Wer to go for a public event.
---
You mean the one that doesn't bathe and plays the same two bar guitar riff all day long? ;)
---
I love mine. It’d pretty much be like playing without marsupial was for me now, it’s a necessity and it makes travelling so much more fun for me, especially being bloodied. I make games out of seeing what jumps I can make and whether serendipity will save me when I jump off Tanagra town and try to time the thrust perfectly to land ok but screw it up. 
---
Depends on your build and how you play for what you should prioritise. I nearly broke down and got the gauss mini when I unlocked it when I was at 1700 bullion, but I’m glad I didn’t.
---
Yes you can’t get enough score to get to 100. Somebody did the math and it’s impossible without spending atoms
---
did it twice, even changed toons. still 3/7 complete
---
i just went ahead and did the 3 i can (screw NW)
---
Well if you want random Flux you can participate in each scorchbeast queen that pops up, if you want to make Flux you'll want to go to a nuked white springs and farm the radiation fluid and masses, as for the non Flux items I actually don't remember what they are, but I suggest using the perk that reduces resource cost for crafting camp items to make it easier
---
Take a rad x and see if your damage changes. Record the numbers before and after
---
The perk that reduces how many materials you need to build in your camp is a big help with the decon shower.
---
You prioritze Humanity over the Human and blindly strike down that which suggests otherwise. Ideas never die but weapons tend to break ✊
---
Yep, upvoted for visibility....  I havent even done my daily runs but some already marked as complete. As you can see my Gold Star already completed for some reason what the fuk? 
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/506915657661808655/727923920942137344/unknown.png
---
You haven't rebutted his statement . You are angry for not being able to get everything? If not I apologize.
---
SBQ runs, and if possible jump somewhere safe, or run to someone's tent, as soon as the rewards arrive and stash the stable flux as you will lose it on death.
---
Yup I just press RR on meat piles instead of pressing EEEEEEEE, I must be playing wrong.
---
“Like it should have been from the start.”
---
Cannot agree with that sentiment more.
---
It’s not impossible
---
seriously though. the first few shots are always worthless. i just single fire until one hits then let loose. ammo efficiency is out the window currently hah
---
ratty wants that corn
---
Ok. More weapons of mass distraction being crafted i take it ? 😋
---
Really? Even with the one you can repeat endlessly?
---
Is that so bad to spend atoms? Why does everyone want something for free. These people have families to feed and dont want to work for free. If you a casual player you wont unlock everything without paying. And that's fine, I have plenty of games with locked content because I play casually. If it was easy there would be nothing for the serious players to do. You don't need everything! And if you really want it pay for it. That's how the real world works. I would get use to it or your going to live an unfulfilling life.
---
lost the game on the first day... fantastic....
---
... unless there's some meat week stuff in the future to catch up with
---
Trade for flux if you want it fast. If not, nuke zones. Farm for flux from plants, hardened mass and high radiation fluid from enemies. Also, do the scorched earth event when it pops up, you'll get a few each time you complete it. Good luck.
---
I have no idea what your saying. But I also don’t care.
---
Yes you can. There math is wrong and ignores other ways to get score outside of daily and weekly challenges.
---
All the atom rewards along the way if held can finish it
---
You can use your excess atoms,problem solved ?
---
Check your roof. Maybe you placed one unknowingly that glitched up onto a roof?
---
Loved your "for some reason" comment.  Made me laugh today, so rare in the times we live in
---
Dread it, run from it, the stealth archer build always arrives
---
I think it would be better just PS4 and Xbox honestly, PC has way too many weird weapons and armor.
---
Nope did that already
---
math is flawed, need more information to fill in all the unknown variables:
---
- dont know if it scales indefinitely
---
- is there a cap on score needed/tier
---
- if the score needed resets at each board phase
---
- if each weekly's go up in value
---
- wtf going on with events
---
sending request to dataminers.exe
---
error, no datamine entries found
---
There are the parts that are repeatable so you will probably need to take advantage of that
---
If they would actually listen and fix the shit plenty of people would be willing to explain it. Or just take 5 minutes and watch a YouTube video about the weapon.
---
Was very excited for the update because it may have had something to spice up the wait for new content.  But it’s demoralizing also knowing it’s basically impossible to complete without atoms.
---
Look at the existing groups. There were plenty of people joining groups that weren't doing stuff together. You can still get the bonuses if you aren't working together, sort of like how teams in Nuclear Winter work. Heck, I came across a couple groups where people were AFK.
---
Spoiler:
---
&gt;!is this the old thing for vault 79 location? !&lt;
---
i.e. fernando's map piece
---
[edit: spoiler i guess]
---
Ok so I jumped into NW for the first time since release last night (obvious reasons) and that’s the last I’ve played. Before that I was in private world completing most of the challenges. So should I expect to be screwed on today’s daily challenges when I login to private again?  Or how do I prevent this?
---
yepp, not cool.
---
If your talking about the problem when you access it it shows the bottom of the stand not the monitor then you should realize that it does that only In power armor you have to exit it to access it without bugging
---
Xbox...and Not gonna lie I totally got lucky on the events, but I’ve also been sitting on a stack of Recall cards just waiting for teams to go live.
---
not always but squirrels often spawn directly across the river form the overseers camp..
---
not always.. but some type of small critter will often spawn there
---
Yes you can fill out the full board. I don’t want to give anything away. It’s not an official quest but a fun little scavenger hunt. The black light helps
---
Yes. Depends on how you like to play though. It enhances mobility. Helps you to get wherever you want to go. Marsupial on its own already takes care of a lot of that, especially with strange in numbers. Do you have other gold bullion goals?
---
I get you’re trying to be funny and cute but you come across as being an ass hole
---
All this changes are designed to make us spend more money on the game,  probably investors idea
---
1. No more easy atoms on dailys
---
2. Cool season pass but very hard to get all free
---
3. Sales with 50% off and free on xbox game pass for PC to increase player base and potential consumers
---
Personally I don't see any problems due to the large amount of free content after the release.
---
The server has a cost and the employees have a cost to keep the game alive.
---
I've been playing since launch and all I spent was buying the game.  Either do this or make mandatory monthly fees.
---
Same thing was with my Stanley custom skin but they just fixed it
---
Wrong mindset my dude. Join up, people will embrace it, and it won’t take long before you are hitting with the best of them
---
Haven’t been getting score from publics either...
---
I hope u ppl can do the same with Dota2 battle pass
---
Repeatable events, excess atoms can be used to gain more levels or am I missing something?
---
Well I'm Canadian and fortunately for me my education has taught me that 90% of the population of the world lives north of the equator, so I highly doubt that its winter for 50% of the playerbase. Thanks for being condescending though!
---
I was logged in during the change and had no issues. I wish people would add more info like which system they had the problem. I'm Xbox and most glitches I hear about I never see.
---
I’m out of ideas then. All my other suggestions have been suggested by other users already.
---
You're right... Will do this weekend ,fuck it !
---
Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of people offering stuff with bash damage etc. it’s the god roll items I didn’t see. Or if I did, they want 1:1 for an item worth maybe 1/5 Best offer I got was 4 items worth about 200k caps together
---
(Laughs in Perk Loadout Manager and Text Chat)
---
R = Square/X
---
E = X/A
---
By landmass, but 90% of the population lives north of the equator
---
It is easy enough. You get 9*150 atoms on the way, thats 9 levels if you can not reach the goal. And thats 9% progession, for free.
---
You should use those on later levels when you need higher score points.
---
This game is a lost cause. I played a little bit of wastelanders but it still feels too grindy and the rewards are not worth the time sunk into it. Bethesda literally ignores every good suggestion about their game and only makes things worse with every update. Money is their endgame, not their fans respect.
---
Same here, 2/7 challenges completed on login, gona send Bethesda a ticket 🤔
---
How about an [Ammo-O-Matic (scrap and make ammo)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41864/)
---
What sucks is having to literally set an alarm to tell me to alt f4 (dropping a single ammo first to "save")
---
I can agree with that,  just don’t see how some people are downvoting* him for pointing out something obvious to PC players.  I’ve been advocating for text chat since beta and it’s insane it hasn’t happened.   
---
You’ll just get people defending them saying “They said the player base is mostly console”. Which really doesn’t excuse anything.
---
I have no idea what your saying. But I also don’t care since your on Console.
---
laughs in quantum
---
I don’t have F1st so no excess atoms.. plus I’m really tight with them lol like money irl.. 😀
---
Already did they can't add missing score
---
I remember when the game launched you didn’t receive atoms for discovering certain locations, then months later they added a patch that gave you the atoms you should’ve earned. I’m hoping they can do something like that fast because the legendary run is already a grind as it is without not being rewarded for the points you spend time earning. If you can’t get ahead even when playing fairly I don’t see the point in even trying.
---
I get ya, people will argue it still doesn't prove what caused it (even though I firmly believe it is the challenges completing as well).
---
What would really sell it is to see is someone who has all the challenges already completed get points.  They will still have the repeatable xp one active but that is easy to track and drops to only awarding 100 xp after the first completion.
---
The repeatable.. particularly if there will be a double exp week in the future is the way to go. I was making 1000 non score exp per scorchbeast and 250 per scorched being in a group with the lunch box. Now imagine that with double xp week. You also share experience in a team so it goes up pretty quick. I saw some guy already hit level 14 recently.
---
Why not just let you scrap any ammo for copper/steel/lead.  Then craft what you need?
---
If you scrapped it at the scrapbox it doesn't count.
---
If dr zorbo beats you to the end does that mean you can’t earn the rewards anymore
---
Did you do the math yourself or are you just going by a streamer?
---
Because they want you to use that bright orange wood armor paint that you got with Fallout First to make you a big giant target in NW. :P 
---
Actually, people are reporting that it looks like applying any skin to armor for nuclear winter is broken right now, so it's not just the new Gillie Suit wood armor.
---
Pepperoni rolls giving 75 carry weight is amazing :) grilled radstag giving 50 is great too. Please don't fix!
---
No lmao somebody made a post
---
The community needs to realize wastelanders got a lot of positivity regardless of the egregious grind they added to the game, and I bet the developers assumed that was A-OK.  This is the approach they are probably going to take with most future content now and personally I’m worried.
---
a bulk deposit for points would be better...
---
(2000 .38 ammo to buy 90 2mm is... brain hurty)
---
Strategic Challenges Or Remedial Experience
---
Can’t complain about it... haven’t used it yet
---
I feel the same way about it. Do yourself a favor and try to get two pieces of armor with the 50% fall damage reduced perks. You’ll thank me later. No fall damage ever again. And the best part? You don’t take fall damage mid air when you use springboard traps either. Why is that important? [Because now you have a new mode of transportation to anywhere on the map](https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E)
---
That would work although it would defeat the purpose of a converter because you could use the materials for other things like gun repairs, hazmat suits, ext.
---
And? That doesn’t change the fact that “it’s summer” doesn’t mean anything as “it’s winter” is equally true.
---

"We currently plan to have four Seasons per year. Each will generally last for around 10 weeks, with a few weeks’ break before the next Season begins."
---
Autocompleted for me when it did they daily changeover, and I was in the server

I think I found something that should help: [https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/12/21](https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/12/21)
---
I think you’re getting the score early. Most of my weeklies and dailies gave me their score reward about 1/3 of the way through them. This is confusing the masses. Hopefully they’ll fix it soon.
---
You’re making a good point here. Maybe that’s planned already. We will have to wait and see once we progress further into score
---
Well im not mad persay. But the board game rewards thing is really freakin laggy like it wants to crash. Could be due to idk.. its oversized.
---
Sometimes the truth hurts
---
Oh! Now we know why they waited til now to get us ammo converters...
---
BST*, it's Summer!
---
Winner, winner... !!!!!
---
I was kinda curious to jump back in but after reading this... nah, screw that. I'm not joining the next horribly designed endless grind. I quit this game the second I had the reputation grind for the settlers done and never really missed it since.
---
We’re you able to get past level 5? Seemed like I couldn’t receive more score points for the day after I was at level 5. Is there a limit in levels you can achieve per day???
---
Still looking for that. 1333 average events to get to shielded, guess I must have a bunch to go.
---
I moved to no man's sky after it came out on game pass and boy is it more fun. Theres still a little grind but its not months of grind.. theres content constantly coming out and most of the mechanics are very friendly.
---
i added PC to it.
---
Assuming the dailies give 2k a day then you can get it from that revealed of the weekly ones or events.
---
No they don't.
---
PS4 issue. Seems to happen a fair amount from having a google
---
Guessing is a pretty much direct Xbox port
---
Your dm's must be exploding.
---
Should I contribute with one more?
---
I don't worry about downvotes.  I just assumed the down votes are from the "everybody gets a participation trophy" generation.  The ones that think everything is owed to them and owed to them now.  
---
 10 weeks to get to level 100 seems feasible to me.
---
4000 score points from the weeklies + 1750 from the dailies (and anything you earned from the repeatable) puts you right around 6k Score, rank 7 is where you should be.  I believe everyone is receiving the correct SCORE, but because we aren't receiving SCORE for events or anything other than the listed dailies and weeklies, people don't realise when it pops early and think that they earned some additional SCORE from something else. Once you complete your weeklies, you should be around rank 10. It sounds like you are right on track for this.
---
I feel like we should have seen this coming from a mile away.  Having the triple daily grind they’ve shoved into our faces.  They just keep adding more free game bullshit into this and it’s honestly really annoying that these guys have control of the IP rn.
---
Yes love it! For me the hardest part was rolling the right chest piece for the jet pack.. it took..... a while ahem!
---
I think it should only be 7% and stack 5x
---
&gt; How long is 10 weeks?
---
Exactly 70 days
---
&gt; it’s definitely more than* 70 days
---
what
---
Don't know that I can add much to the conversation, but--oh my god, this interface is ridiculous. I was already less inclined to use it due to the points conversion, but--having to click through all of these screens dozens of times to work through a stack of ammo? What were they thinking?
---
So wait, there are public teams you can just join? Not having to invite people all the time to hope to get SBQ cheese rewards?
---
The day before the update I killed her three times, twice with a team, and got nothing.
---
How is this the game's fault? Because people cant put two and two together? The game flat out tells us this works on animals, are we supposed to assume the Queen isn't an animal?
---
I like the cut of your (word I can’t spell) hit me
---
Spend Cash On Repair- kits Everyday
---
Yes, especially the non-PA version as it doesn't use fusion cores. Pair it with Marsupial and Bird Bones for maximum fun. But your AP burns out really fast. Bring along lots of honey, royal jelly taffy and coffee. You get tons of free taffy and honey from the commie bot set to proletariat. It's the best collectron in the game. I always end up selling my spare stimpaks and rad aways for caps each day because he keeps me stocked on them.
---
This, how hard would it have been to set it up like the legendary grinder? It would be so much less annoying to sit there and mash space on a pile of ammo.
---
It's that way in a lot of game subreddits, really
---
No. Someone said 12 IIRC
---
I bugged out on one SBQ event last night. Did not shoot her at all. Relaunched game, got back thru the menu to my team and still got to loot her.
---
I have a 'Gold Star' daily today - do 5x dailies and get one free. That's an extra 20% each time it shows up. And how many 10k XP repeatables can I do each day? Certainly more than one, and they add up to free SCORE points over time. 
---
So maybe the Math isn't quite the full story after all? It's not meant to be easy, but it's far too early to talk about it being 'IMPOSSIBLE!' (Less than 24hrs and I'm Rank 9, ahead of the curve early certainly will help later on)
---
Every rank the score requirement goes up by 25. To get from 99 to 100 will take somewhere around 3500 score.
---
The first few ranks will go by pretty quick, but it'll start slowing down as you need more score per rank.
---
Not OP but I got to level 8 after doing all the dailies and weeklies yesterday.
---
Honestly I'm so involved still trying to get decent SS unyielding bits with decent modifiers (I seem to have a massive bias towards weightless, 6 pieces) I'd be happy with anything. Currently got AP chest but I'm looking to upgrade everything. 
---
I definitely may look into the springboard stuff though, looks great fun and I may place some at my base so I can take off in any direction. The jetpack game definitely has me hooked, it reminds e of trying to get the Dodo to fly in GTA 3 back in the day so it's currently occupying me greatly as well as activating my nostalgia chip :D
---
Devs don't even play this fucking game, it's that fucking bad.
---
Well, I said you sound like somebody who played the game once. And your criticism was pretty sweeping and really, really inaccurate. I'll be honest, you sound like one of those YouTubers that's getting likes because of their constant railing against Bethesda.
---
Bitching about 76 has pretty much become a cottage industry now.
---
Hoarding anything in this game with the idea you might be able to sell it one day will never bring you joy. Just "play" the game...you know, do the quests, explore new areas, make friends, only keep ammo for the weapons you actually use regularly, those type of things are what the developers intended to make you smile.
---
Hell yes. Public teams are end game shredding fun.
---
It's demotivating when the only thing I care about are the CAMP items, and they're so few and far between that it just doesn't feel like progress when I'm only getting one every two weeks. Then on top of that the whole thing is bugged, so I just don't even feel like bothering.
---
Didnt they remove the ability to earn atoms from the daily/weekly challenges?
---
[Here you go :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
I think the two main mitigators will be double XP events (if they still happen, I see no reason why they won't right now), and using atoms earned from the board to buy the last 10 ranks (you get 1500 total which is just enough). The atoms will save you a week and double XP events could end up saving an additional week, if played well.
---
It's still a long grind, that's for sure. But I can't say it's worse than other games I've played. Whether this is better than before probably depends on how many items you like from the board, and how much you enjoy the challenge changes with the really tedious ones removed.
---
It’s just a bug, you should be taking out all it’s health and the server knows that so it snaps back up. I have that issue with my OP shotguns and it’s very strange
---
Yup i got the converter in less than 30mins it was a gimme at only lev 5 and again I dont see much problem with that either yea I get it its weak we can convert the whole stack at once but after you do the first conversation you literally just have to mash (A on xbox) I converted over 10k ammo in about ten minutes. 
---
And how can you say that they are time consuming chores 
---
 first daily was chew a piece of gums took all of 3 secs 
---
Second kill 10 scorched took 60 secs
---
Today number one is collect 3 purified water 
---
So how in the hell are theese time consuming chores sounds like YOU dont play this game
---
Jib
---
It was my first time encountering it on ps4 last night I restarted the app and it fixed it
---
Bad luck ig
---
exactly where im stuck at, any idea how we can report this?
---
I was at level 8 when I finished playing last night. Completed weeklies first thing this morning and made it to level 10.
---
No--they expect you to miss days, still want to those end items, and pay for them with Atoms...
---
It's power generation is over 9000
---
12
---
I had location icons for workshops in a private server yesterday and workshop icons today so I have no idea what the issue is
---
No idea. Never farmed dailies or weeklies.
---
Interesting, I'd heard that you could have Ward glitch in some ways, but didn't realise you could essentially make his daily repeatable. I'm allied with both Factions now, so haven't much use for glitching it, unless I want to slowly get Scrip i guess.
---
its a damn shame and considering how bugged a lot of things are right now not sure when our problem is gonna get fixed. I haven't seen many people with this issue except us 3 in this thread
---
Honestly, they need to take a leaf out of Bungie's book, the grind comparing both D2 and F76, D2 has much more variety whereas F76 is just the challenges.. even as a grinded that's not fun and I'm not spending Atoms even if I grind my ass off they need to rethink it or add more ways to gain SCORE
---
Yeah, but it gives off white light instead of orange for some reason v.v
---
Does the exp you earn carry over to each of the items or do I need to gain the exp for each of them individually?
---
30% seems right to me.. 5% more max for stacking 2 additional mutations isnt worth it to me.. half the people playing are taking every mutation they can as it is..
---
mutations are way common and the downside vs. low health are not as severe 
---
I dont feel like mutant should be as buffed as junkies or bloodied.. YMMV thats just my opinion
---
I remember the first press release thing they put out had a breakdown of the acronym but they updated it and now I can't find it anywhere... weird.
---
I'm glad it's not just me.  VATS for gauss rifle has been so broken for so long that I've completely abandoned my rifleman build.  Pure melee isn't what I intended on when I first bought FO76 but here we are.
---
The *thud* and *cha-ching* of melee have greatly soothed my disappointment with the gauss in VATS. Not my typical play style though.
---
I haven't played in about a month but I used to complete the dailies and weeklies if they were easy enough just to get a few extra atoms.
---
I feel ya, getting the right rolls on that stuff is important. I’ve got full unyielding as I’m a bloodied build, but I find myself more often than not just rolling around without two of those, and just crap leather armor with those fall damage perks. If you thought just the jetpack was a game changer, I can’t express how much I recommend the fall damage stuff. It’s a whole new game now in which you’re an unstoppable superhero
---
Nope, all weeklies and dailies were already accounted for. It couldn't have been anything but the event, and was rewarded immediately upon completion.
---
Sometimes they just have normal location icons instead of the regular  white circle / player icon if claimed.
---
Weird  I completed all dailys and one weekly and am only on level 3
---
Adrenal reaction seems to be working fine at least when I just tested it.
---
 I'm currently at 40HP with adrenal reaction my quad revolver says it's damage is 155 
---
 Now adrenalin reaction suppressed by rad-x at 40HP my quad revolver now say it hits for 107
---
True, but also the 10K XP challenge is repeatable
---
I’m being cautious on rating the challenges until we get deeper into the season, but so far so good. Much of the outrage seems focused on ammo converter, some rage at the Atom earn rate under the new system, some math based concern about being able to complete the season, some hate for season passes in any form, and the usual gripes about reward quality. I kind of see where everyone is coming from. I’m trying to focus on what is working for me. Public teams are low key commitments that have not impeded my lone wolf play, and have been helping me get through events I find too annoying to try to solo. The season rewards give a touch of incentive to keep playing the game. The events in general are dumb if you pause to think about them, but it feels like there’s more reason to jump into them. I’m not sure how much this whole thing will hold my interest, but overall, I’m mostly enjoying it so far.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Kill squirrels
---
That’s why I say 7%, leading to a max of 35. Even that’s high, but it’s better than 10 and mutants just kinda sucking
---
Inb4theremoval.
---
Ps4 i use 50 cals for my sniper build with shotguns as my secondrary weapon and my oh shit thats alot of fucking ghouls weapon being the 10mm sub machine gun
---
I can't wait to get fucking raped by hackers in NW all summer as I desperately try to collect SCORE.
---
It’s all ongoing. So you’re constantly working towards that 14,000 exp skeleton costume for example, even as you’re unlocking the other rewards
---
Yup it just randomly turns into normal location icons for no reasons
---
Was it from getting exp? I did events including Scorched Earth while in a fully bonded team and got zero score from it.
---
Wait you are upset because the map is a different button that doesn’t require you to open your pip boy?
---
Its damn fine decoration for my camp tho
---
I'll give it a stab, it's not like it matters much mostly anyway and I've been meaning to experiment a bit with troubleshooters etc at some point as well. I'll definitely give it a go if I see any about.
---
Thanks for the vid and the convo!
---
If there’s no negative then I’m about to free up so much fucking weight!
---
thank you for your bravery.
---
You make some valid points abouts the flaws in the game, but you also do make very biased remarks, as I have read in other users comments. I was not a BETA player, hell I wasn't even a day 1 player. I started playing about a month after release when all the bugs and stuff were still fresh out of the gate. To this day I will say the game is amazing and has changed dramatically. Is it perfect? Nowhere close, but from my perspective it's still a damn good game. This new ammo converter I just got myself today, I love the idea but am disappointed with the execution. Like many others I have voice my displeasure, will I stop playing because of it? Hell no. I will just work around it. I recall you or someone else saying "when you spend $60 on a game". I'm not going to get specific about who said that but I will say this.... I don't know anyone on here so I don't know how old anyone is, I'm 38, I still remember back in the mid 90s when some SNES games would cost you north of $100, so paying $60-80 for a game today is peanuts in comparison, and especially with Fallout 76 where all DLC and related content is FREE (FYI I don't have Fallout 1st)
---
I got SCORE for doing multiple events both today and yesterday and not just for the 10k exp repeatable
---
Nice. Must’ve been a bug, then shortly after my internet took a crap. So I stayed at 5. First time my ISP takes a crap in years! And it had to be yesterday 😩😫
---
Just recently got a PC and the amount of games I wish would do this is depressing to think about .
---
In had the same problem, it even completed one of my 3 events and then wouldn’t count any others. This was supposed to be fixed with this patch, but I guess not. This needs a hot fix or they’re gonna have a lot of pissed off people.
---
I found that my SCORE is updating after reaching certain points (25/50/75%) of the level I’m on. I can be in the middle of another event and see my SCORE increase even though the event is not complete. 
---
I wonder if everyone is getting SCORE from every event, and it only shows the increase after reaching a certain amount of XP on your meter.
---
I was getting score in the middle of SBQ and Project Paradise events (so it looks like score is given per damage or actions taken not completion) but I am not absolutely sure that it was not repeatable XP reward or something so far. Will look out more today.
---
I wonder if they were hesitant to make it inventory-based because of all of the issues/exploits that have come up with vendors and display cases?
---
No problem. Are you on PS4 by chance? I’ve been saving every legendary with those perks to gift to someone wanting to try exactly this. If you are, I’ll give them to you when you’re on
---
I don’t understand what the complaint is. I got the ammo converter yesterday and used it a bunch to get rid of BS ammo I have been storing, and get ammo that goes quick (5mm, .308). 
---
While the terminal is tedious to interface with, it lets you spam the controls to skip through the menus once you have a repeatable button path. 
---
Could someone detail some of the issues they’ve experienced with it? Because for me, it’s been a blessing.
---
Finished all the dailies/weeklies yesterday and got SCORE for an event before the reset.
---
Could be :/ but just wanted to check if its even possible
---
Or damage vs. Enemies
---
I'm honestly not surprised at all. This is clearly just another way to sell shit (including if I may add - items which are strikingly similar to loot boxes).
---
Except that they've also found a way to make it a tool to drive FOMO and promote daily logins.
---
Hit lvl 9 yesterday
---
Did they give you a solution at all, or is it a case of suck it up and see what the devs do?
---
So the next stupid question of the day, how do you charge the Gauss Shotgun?
---
It could be, I haven’t seen any bugs like missing pa spawns
---
"I don’t wanna go into the maths. But when I read that I had to do EVERY  single daily from now, and till the season ends, and still be far away  from 100, I was a bit disappointed. "
---
I really don't understand this response. You don't want to get into the math... so you're just going to accept a false conclusion? Because what you wrote here is simply not true.
---
You don't have to do EVERY single daily frmo now, and you won't come up short if you do. You certainly won't be far away. If you choose to do all of the daily/weekly quests you will end up 5000 score short of full completion, which will almost certainly be completed through the XP repeatable as you do the challenges. So if you do the challenges regularly you will finish the board in time.
---
There are also ways to mitigate this. Double XP events and XP buffing in general, using chems, perks, group benefits, etc. That can shave a week off at least if you're killing lots of baddies. Using the 1500 atoms you get from the board to purchase ranks will also shave a week off at the end, if you're ok with using the atoms that way (I'm sure many will).
---
I'm not trying to say that the grind is nice, or that it shouldn't be criticized. But you're spreading a false take on how the grind is and with 94% upvote it's sad to see people eating it up. You should always do the math and get the real conclusions...
---
PS I was leader of events group at that moment with some folks still "bonding in".
---
Ty for testing it out,i am not home atm to test it myself,just wondering why am i doing lower dmg after patch 20...was sure it was adrenal reaction,need to test it with rad x when i come home,thx again!
---
I haven’t gotten that one yet but that’s pretty good.
---
Well looks like I'm gonna be playing some matches for the Gift Wrap Hunting Rifle then!
---
This. I have a feeling they planned this so that FO1st sub's atoms are counted to be used to this season crap. So that FO1st and seasons go hand in hand.
---
I like when I'm on my private server and in the middle of doing an event and then get disconnected. Hahahaha, I pay more for this than Netflix...
---
I haven’t seen anyone hating on him for the opinion that additional changes are needed or that text chat needs to be implemented. 
---
I’ve seen resistance based on **how** he is expressing himself.
---
It’s all about diplomacy and presentation.
---
As much as I understand what you're saying (as I play both, adventure more though) They should focus more on integrating more S.C.O.R.E rewards into NW so they don't render an entire mode useless in the current economy of the game (again). They're essentially forcing people to stop playing Nuclear Winter if they want any hope of completing this pass.
---
I got to use it last night finally and found it wasn't as bad as I expected after seeing all the posts, with so many ammo types to chose from the list would be ridiculously long if they weren't organized in this way.
---
The menu sticks to your last bought or sold item so it's pretty quick to just smash the button and unload all you have.
---
Allowing you to just increase the multiplier up to the maximum amount you have would be more ideal, that or perhaps a sell all option for each ammo type.
---
Ammo converter also had the benefit of looking like some sort of medical device and added on well with my Silent Hill inspired camp.at the price of 2 scarecrows.
---
Overall was happy with the item, some room for some quality of life improvements, also would like an option to convert to flamer fuel.
---
I’ve noticed that since Wastelanders DLC dropped I get DC I’m my private a lot more often. Before it was pretty rare. At least for me
---
This lol so much this hahaha
---
Also what the hell does "I could see my soul leave my body" even mean? Lol.
---
I actually don’t think it’s all that bad. People aren’t accounting for the repeatable weekly to earn XP (which could alternate to public events). Regular players will get a lot from that and it doesn’t appear to be capped in any way. 
---
That said, with the autocomplete bug reappearing and them having no ability/willingness to award bugged points, they should add something else as a backup plan.
---
If you get an award such as the beanie in NW, does that carry over to adventure mode as well? I never play NW lol
---
I asked for 150 atoms to buy the missing rank from the 1500 score lost. reason being I can buy the missing rank, and they are able to do that I know.
---
Unfortunately not, I'm on PC but I very much appreciate the offer.
---
Nice! I have been searching for info ever since I got Xmas wreath and gifts for NW dailys
---
Nah. I’m not mixing stuff up to play in a group for an hour.
---
I hate how they tie it to dailies and weeklies. All the other games with battlepasses get exp for just playing the game. How is that so hard to understand and implement for FO76. They had the potential to bring back so many players into the game but it seems as if the player count will drop even lower - which may cause them to make more micro-transactions to make up for the lack of customers/players.
---
Yeah. This is going to make the score a even bigger grind
---
I was assuming it was supposed to come with the patch that removes the need to eat and drink and they accidently added it early.  Herbivore and Carnivore will be losing value that patch without a buff.  Fingers crossed it is intended but accidental.
---
I am not changing my mutations since I have the stack I like.  Bethesda has a habit of changing things that are too good so I am not doing something I can't easily undo.  I will run the appropriate perks since those are easy to fix.
---
Has this changed? It has always been a 50 light limit for all types of lights which is pretty reasonable IMHO.
---
It a bug. Once you have them you get to keep them.
---
Why does this sound like a Karen screeching for the manager
---
Also, if you have people joining who are running low health builds, please don’t share Rad Sponge.
---
Gotcha. Worth a try
---
They count as lights, which are limited to reduce strain on the server.
---
I've never bought a repair kit. Workbenches work great
---
For the Halloween stuff yes. For Xmas rewards it’s not, so 27001 xp total for Christmas.
---
On PS4 it saves what option your on in the ammo converter menus, so it's just spam clicking and boom you got points. I feel bad for PC yikes
---
If it sucks, don't play it. Move on.
---
Noisemakers does +5% to robots and fingertrap does +5% to ghouls and super mutants
---
1350 total. That's over 10 weeks with 2 break weeks. Meaning at best you'll average 112.5 atoms per week. That's less than two days of the old system. The entirety of the 1350 atoms could be earned in under 20 days in the old system if there was something you wanted. Many deals even last that long in the atom shop. So you could go from 0 to that item before it left.
---
Now you can only get 1350 atoms every 84 days. For context. A bundle costs 1500 and many power armor skins are 1400. You will have to wait more than three months to get a single power armor skin of your choosing.
---
And these aren't challenges that can be completed in one event quest like the old one. Each rank is expected to take at least an hour according to Bethesda. So it will be 89 hours of gameplay to reach the atoms, and then you won't even be able to get a power armor skin. And not even two of just about any other type
---
Generator just went Super Saiyan.
---
I’m getting Halloween and Christmas. I haven’t seen VTU yet but I’m hopeful. That streamer trunk looks cool!
---
Or if you like your offspring with an unconventional number of appendages.
---
Maybe has something to do with the 15 mothmen that apparently killed him
---
Kudos there mate - good story
---
Oh. Well, that's only 100-200 hours of gameplay then. What a steal
---
Holy shit that’s a drag, oh well I only really wanted the Halloween one. Thanks for the info
---
*So you have chosen...death*
---
I never experienced any of what you described.  I gave it a try once Wastelanders dropped. It was fun for a time, but you blow through the content so fast. There’s no substance to the game. There are singular missions that are really good (raiding the scorchbeast lair in search of the missing BoS knight) but not enough to carry the game. Fallout 3, NV, and 4 are memorable because they have characters and stories that resonate with fans. 76 doesn’t.
---
Tweak a few quality of life mechanics, add good characters, good stories; 76 could have been a fantastic. Instead, it’s wasteland exploration simulator.
---
Yeah, I know, I went through all of them (I think), I've been doing them since the B.E.T.A., I had been down to only Repair Chest Armor left, with no more Repair Weapon challenges. Patch 20 added one more: Repair Swords [0/76]. Let's see if those two mark the end of the line for me. ;-)
---
Just asking since i only got 18h in the game does pa spawn in arktos pharma?
---
I laughed when I saw the character has over 4000kg of carry weight when he is looking at the map.
---
It wouldn't matter if there was a law.
---
A laws effectiveness it limited by its enforceability.
---
There are many laws that are stupid and not enforced.
---
He/she has a very childish argument if you can call it that.
---
I never really consciously did the challenges before and usually completed about 60% just from playing the game. I took about 2 hours last night and did all the weekly and all the daily. Wasn't too bad and gave me something to do. Other then the ammo recycler being a big disappointment the rewards seem pretty good.
---
*chicken tender subs are on sale this week*
---
This is my complaint and turn off from the pass. I don't like doing a chore list of things... Let me just play the game how I like to play it and be able to advance.
---
Only up to rank 89. You only get 1350 atoms total. That's barely enough to buy a damn thing over the course of 12 weeks
---
The holiday skins can very easily be rereleased whenever a holiday rolls around
---
Same with Future-Tec Globe
---
I'm glad you appreciated my hyperbole.
---
They are adding in repeatable dungeon quest things with the next update wave im pretty sure.
---
Yeah, all those rewards carry over to adventure mode and are shared between your characters. It’s account wide and the unlocks can be seen in the atomic shop
---
To echo the other guy, just join a team, or create your own. I was playing with a couple friends last night (all level 300+) and we turned our team public after someone dropped off and we had an open spot. A level 12 joined us almost immediately. We had it set for "Event" team, and after he got fully bonded he was going up a level every 15 minutes or so. He didn't have a mic, but he could hear us, so we were just giving direction on how to win/survive the events, and he was emoting hearts and thumbs up all over the place.

At one point someone launched on the queen and he was getting wrecked, so I dropped him a marsupial serum, told him to drink it, and then told him to hop up on the tent. He didn't end up doing enough damage to get queen loot, but he did manage to tab a legendary death claw and a legendary hermit crab, so he was happy.
---
I hit a triple once at New River Resort.  When I was at like level 4 or something.  Possibly this is the reason I'm still playing this game.
---
OK thanks for checking 👍
---
you get 500 at rank 100 too, but yeah that’s like one bundle and something else
---
Same situation here.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hiuuz3/why_isnt_flamer_fuel_in_the_ammo_converter_or/

My understanding is it is mislabeled as 10mm under energy
---
flamer is under energy, and labeled as 10mm for some reason
---
Scrapped 150 ammo to get a qty of 12 .308???? Lol
---
You're missing something look again.  It's not called fuel.
---
i earned some atoms yesterday doing the dailys.  Not as much as I would have prior to the update. But I got some pretty cool stuff out of it common so I'm not complaining.
---
LOL!
---
"Well son, it was a really warm day in late June and I found this Nuka machine..."
---
hmm maybe i did have to, it was late and i might not have been paying attention. i just know for sure FT after claiming worked on one char but not the other (different workshops also, so its not like i tried the same one between the chars)
---
Oh really. That would explain why some unlocked stuff at different rates. Thanks for this info, NO WAY am I grinding those out to the end now!
---
I've only seen Christmas, I actually would like the diploma so I guess I'm gonna grind some
---
How about "its summer for 90% of the population of planet earth" then... you must be fun at parties
---
Yeah this happens to me to. I thought it was a glitch and I still had to do 5 out of 5. Yeah no I wasted 30 copper.
---
Hi Wastelanders
---
/thread
---
Dude your math is wrong.
---
You get 21500 score per week for doing the dailies and weeklies, not counting the repeatable one (which will give people more score whether they choose to 'do them' or not, as simply earning XP gives you the completion). 
---
There are 6 daily challenges for a total of 2000xp a day. 
---
There are 7 weekly challenges for a total of 7500xp a week.
---
That's 21500 total, not 16500. Big difference. :/
---
I sent a ticket anyway. Yes they describe before you send the ticket that they can't award SCORE, but asked them to anyway. Not acceptable :(
---
That's only 50% of the problem, the other is the cost of buying other ammo is way too much
---
A dumb question here how I can share the perk..
---
Prolly three more patches they’ll get around to halfway fixing it
---
I agree the game has its pain points, but I don’t think your feedback is going to go very far posted with a title of “this game sucks” on a sub full of FO76 fans.
---
shhhhhhh...
---
You don't know this from me, but they still work :)
---
I only use those weapons xD
---
Delete your post before Bethesda sees XD
---
Good point.
---
Oh okay! Thanks for responding. 
---
I haven't checked out the new update but maybe this weekend I'll see for myself.
---
So My experience (PC) is that it went together, when I saw the "normal" workshop icons on the map, FT when owned was free.  When i saw the "new" icons (farm for the homestead, cars for the gorge junkyard) it made me pay.
---
It's a shame the actual game content doesn't have the same standard.
---
I asked for 150 atoms to compensate for the missed score rank up from the points so i could just get it that way
---
Do you know how much and which event?
---
Bethesda: fine. you can do 12 at a time, but it converts the food into food currency that you can then exchange for cooked food. it's also done through a terminal. you're welcome.
---
I have no issue with it being a terminal, which may be a dupe prevention method. That’s all fine, but the UI is still not good. It’s not so bad once your huge stockpiles are gone, but it’s irritating. These changes would help. 
---
Remove the categories of ammo. Just list them all on one page. 
---
Don’t back us out after clicking on one type to trade in, just let it sit there so we can spam the button one time instead of 4—assuming an option to “trade in all” is impossible. 
---
Get rid of the 2000 point limit. It’s arbitrary and pointless. It just adds steps and tedium. If the engine can’t handle infinity, then make it 100k.
---
Can’t you also get SCORE from events in addition to the challenges? That should make it more manageable, no?
---
It's the same as everything else, shoot til dead before time runs out, but occasional damaging aoes.
---
Correct. Dailies and Weeklies give you score now. If you manage to get all the Atoms this season by collecting enough score, you get 1500 Atoms.
---
Before the update, you could earn over 6000 Atoms for doing the same thing in the same amount of time.
---
Look for 10mm ammo, it’s labeled wrong
---
I did get SCORE during (yes not at the endl) SBQ and Project Paradise, it was public team in "events" mode, created these groups myself, with me running quite few public events before. I am not 100℅ sure that it was not repeatable achievements but I am like 50℅ sure that it was not achievements as at that point all dailies were completed and "XP" one was in the middle. Will continue checking it out today. It seems to be either random or based on player actions like damage done, items turned it etc.
---
Quadruple digit hours of gameplay time...triple digit level...
---
Complains constantly and still feels like they're owed something...
---
I can't understand this much entitlement. It's a video game. These people need a psych eval.
---
I've noticed that too actually. I think I'm going to go on a junk spree and cancel it. There's barely any value except getting the atoms, which there's barely anything even anything worth buying, plus with camp budget there's barely room anyway. I bought 1st because I thought it would help develop new experiences for the game, that hasn't panned out.
---
Events are not giving them
---
I’m starting to think it’s for the XP. I wish the game would tell you what goal you hit that awarded it so we knew.
---
Bruh at this point just let us scrap ammo for lead/steel/gunpowder/molded plastic....
---
I second this motion.  No game is for everyone, and no game will have features that make everyone happy.  Like it, love it, hate it - whatever.  Go trade it for Wii Sports if that is your thing.  Ranting to us after 2 weeks of play isn't going to suddenly create a better gaming experience for you.
---
Have you not fought it already?
---
It honestly infuriates me to use. Has so much potential I pray they tweak it
---
You are VERY wrong. Did you take into consideration the weekly challenges? They give a bunch of SCORE
---
If you're a completionist like me, or just someone who really wants a reward item near the end of board, then yes the current system feels like a chore.
---
"Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two."
---
The above quote sounded great to me initially. I figured I would have roughly 150 hours worth of grind to do over 10 weeks. I can do that, no problem. I'll play a few hours during the week, and will do the majority of it over the weekends. While that's feasible for the weekly challenges, having progress locked behind daily challenges very much makes it feel like a chore.
---
Not doing all of your chores, every single day, means paying money out of pocket or abandoning the rewards. That's why people are upset and are already talking about throwing in the towel.
---
You really should have looked this up before you posted it really. This is not a problem whatsoever.

---
The news post for the patch 20 release says it's  10-week season.
---
Well challenges are pretty much the reason I play this game at this point,so I really want to reach the end. But even if the math is correct and we fall short I wouldn't have many peoblem buying the last 5 levels. I may even buy them regardless just to be done quicker after 10 weeks.
---
They reset 9pm est dont they?
---
I’ve noticed that as well, you no longer have a clean arc when you jump, you kind of ‘hitch’ for a moment at the apex. Feels weird, but I still appreciate the extra height
---
Those are mostly reason you’re the level you are now. And without them for 6 days it will go much slower I promise you
---
And sadly by the looks of it we won’t ever get those things they said we would get. Pretty disappointed being honest.
---
Just being able to scrap ammo for lead / steel / gunpowder at any workbench would be the easiest and most logical thing to do.  It would have probably taken them 10 minutes to code, and it would be easy to use.
---
&gt;I do not expect there to be a shovel by the grave
---
It's sad that we just expect it to be bugged
---
Ammo benches let you recycle ammo into lead, powder and casings which could be re crafted into similar ammo types, whilst science benches would allow you to recycle spent energy ammo, condense energy ammo into harder hitting “charged/overcharged” cells *and* convert fusion batteries into them too. The Tinker bench replaced both of these in 76 conceptually but doesn’t have anywhere near as much functionality.
---
2mm EC ammo either. :-/  (not that I could find, anyway)
---
Do you mind sharing their response and not a paraphrase?
---
Don’t events give you score as well? In addition to the challenges? I don’t recall that being factored into the calculations.
---
It’s the total of all lights in your camp, is my guess. Try scrapping a light bulb and see if that affects how many letters you can build.
---
I dont use adrenaline, my sneak sniper build used to one shot all ghouls and super mutants, now it takes 2 shots. I know its not that big of a deal, but its annoying and noticeable. And just why tho...
---
This is false. It was a myth perpetuated by a user on Reddit in the early days of the game. Despite the edits in the wiki, the physical game files omit the Scorchbeast from the list of effected animals

This list was acquired a month or two ago by a dataminer u/gilpo1 (comment thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/esc5do/psa_nuking_a_place_with_loads_of_nukacola_drinks/frf7ut2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)) who has also debunked a myth about nuke zones turning Nuka-Colas to Quantums, as well as several lists of datamined drop rates, most recently those of Fasnacht. If you do not want to accept my word for it, watch any video claiming it works, and the Scorchbeasts will land, yet ignore it completely and even fail to detonate the bait. Test that against any animal on this list and watch as they will go towards it and detonate it. It’s also easy enough to test. The primary factor of the confusion is Placebo effect. If you believe something is real then you’ll twist reality to fit that narrative.

---
Of course, don’t take my word for it. Try it for yourself, and make your own judgements
---
I hope they don't patch this out today, I am almost done with the rewards and only have two left.
---
I had the same issue. The ONLY fix is to contact the mentally challenged bot that is Bethesda Customer support, and after 4 or so emails back and forth in which you repeatedly give it the same information, namely the quest name, location, quest stage, character information, your information, your platform, nature of the bug, and that yes you have tried resetting the game (turning it off and back on again) in numerous ways. 
---
After these hoops have been jumped through, and about a week of waiting, Bethesda bot will finally reset the quest and you just start from scratch. 
---
No joke this is what I personally went through
---
Plus events give score too I think?
---
Yes I do realize that. But still, I estimate it will take 7-8 weeks of doing every challenge to get to lvl 100
---
The season lasts 10 weeks
---
Just start a level 1 character. Takes 1 match.
---
Then....why are you still holding onto something you dont want? Sounds like an unhealthy relationship.
---
Edited to include that!
---
Don’t you get score from events as well?
---
Disappointing that they delayed legendary perks because they wanted to act on feedback, but this suggests they are pretty much the same?
---
Bethesda does this too often. They time gate their game and expect us to give them 100% of our time. They can't seem to understand people do shit outside fo76.
---
I saw the pre-made message, but this is before you send your ticket. Go through with sending your ticket, they need to be made aware of this.
---
That happened before public teams tho
---
It would take 13.5 weeks assuming that it keeps growing like it does atm. So you see the problem?
---
But ofc this is counted without the repeatable one. That’s too hard too calculate how many times players achieve it
---
It has already been shown that score alone from dallies, and weekly challenges won't be enough
---
Yeah the amount of ammo it takes to convert into useful ammo is just very time consuming to do. I got 60 .556 rounds and was then stopped and realized it wasn’t worth my time.
---
How can i email them, the only support i can find online is a trash forum that obviously doesn’t have my issue.
---
This is false, despite the wiki claim. The comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hja65t/in_skyrim_we_had_dragonrend_to_nail_dragons_to/fwln2we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) details why this is the case and the evidence I have available. I went into deep debate against the original poster who refused to accept any evidence I provided, from multiple videos showing it doesn’t work, to handing the code for effected animals
---
i dont get it
---
I dunno...  Why do you sound like a condescending byotch?
---
I think you are misreading the email. They are asking you to click that link and submit feedback there. It needs to go to a different team. The thing about lost items is on every single response from them. Has nothing to do with your request.
---
This was their response from my ticket! I'm trying to go through the link they provided to post another but the catagory for challenges is missing!
---
Under further investigation the screaming seems to have been a lure for creatures but i dont know about the rumbling.
---
Sorry? Only one? Did it post more or something?
---
Careful what you wish for, the dev team has a habit of straight up removing stuff if people complain too much.
---
Lol. Good to know, thanks.
---
 I also have a minigun and did attempt to test that one on a behemoth.  Shot him in the back of the head with 100 rounds before his AI started responding or he even began taking damage so my results were inconclusive to say the least.  Never messed with it again after that.
---
Do you have a source or the math? I would like to revise that.
---
Latching on to a feeling of power or authority most likely. Helps them feel like their in control of something. You'd have to tear that feeling from their cold dead hands.

---
If you like exploring in fallout 4, want a bigger world, and enjoy grinding and doing quests, yes
---
No and I nuked the exact spot where they said it would be at
---
See, someone in bethesda actually played the game once. With level 1000 god mode char, but still!
---
It could be easily improved in many ways and it would still be "duper safe". 
---
Now it's just a weirdly planned machine. I will have to remember dust it now and then.
---
Weird how you expect players to get used to the taste of shit but you seem to have no expectations for the one's shitting in their mouths.
---
I appreciate positivity but Beth has objectively fucked up everything they've done for 76 on some level.  How much more do they need to fuck up before we can hold them accountable without being accused of throwing a hissy fit? 
---
Ffs...
---
yes, makes sense now.  My ineptness point remain though.
---
Non legendary Fixer, level 30, for 2000 caps.
---
Make sure the last thing you play before logging off before the refresh is adventure and the last thing you log into is adeventure. Going into Nuclear Winter first auto completes with no rewards.
---
Do you or anyone else have a recommendation for how to maximize AP (in addition to the honey and taffy tip)? I just don't feel like I can get the air or sustained flight I desire. I have 7 Agility and 4 or 5 Endurance. Are these too low for reliable SS jetpack use? What else am I missing?
---
Are you sure, I don't see that on their website? 
---
But yeah, that doesn't really make a difference at the end of the day that's less than 155 atoms a week. Less than 23 a day...
---
Oddly, I never really noticed this issue until yesterday’s update. It seems like it got noticeably worse for me, not just on my gauss rifle but on my Tesla and lever guns as well. Major bummer for this controller-clutching casual. Might need to switch to mouse and keyboard to improve my accuracy...
---
If there was a law then at least that portion of his claim would have a foundation.  But he has refused to provide an answer to that direct question. I think he realized how foolish he was being.
---
There is a lot of trash talking here on reddit, but I personally like the new score system.
---
I think it makes it easier for players who only play a few days a week to earn all the rewards,  And while yes it is a grind. It gives me task to work through while playing the game.
---
Yes, ty.  I never made the connection to lights in general.
---
Merry Christmas.
---
You'll have to wait 2 weeks or whatever until they unlock the ability to buy SCORE ranks, but its not a terrible solution. Hopefully they give you a favourable response.
---
It doesn’t work, you can find the evidence I’ve provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hja65t/in_skyrim_we_had_dragonrend_to_nail_dragons_to/fwln2we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

---
I don't know, I was never able to afford one. I think that's why they don't make skins for it. People just don't have them
---
I see. How bout performance tho? How often do you experience bugs, glitches and crashes? How grindy is it? Is it like Warframe or Destiny in terms of grinding?
---
Which one buffs sweet water special?
---
I did: help site / fallout 76 / in game support / i need help with a quest (called the quest: daily challenges)
---
Hoping this will bypass the bs automated response
---
You have made no points in your diatribe.
---
I keep getting the rewards before I even finish the weekly activity, but it still stays in my "to do list" until I finish it.
---
terminals are so slow though... ie the ammo converter.
---
This. I want this.
---
Don't ask me why I need so much soup. I have my reasons.

You have to use the Public teams to be awarded the Battle Pass Exp thats whats im been getting for every free travel event

i'm crying right now, why does they not made a score + atoms reward :(
---
Behind the cabins there is a treehouse that will explain what's going on.
---
I'm desperately trying to find more info about that. Any details on it ?

I believe herbivore.

---
There are notes in the cabin, and tapes if I recall, they tell the story.  And the rumbling I thought spawned low level ghouls.  This is near entrance at low levels it was a great shock and wondering what is going on.  Part of lore and places that have cool little stories to piece together
---
I was really hoping the XP boosts from the pass would work on NW but NOPE. That would've been too good lol
---
I rarely crash. In terms of bugs, it depends what you consider a bug. If you get frustrated with any lag whatsoever, yes that could be a problem. Occasionally there are some weird visual bugs but game runs pretty stable for me. 
---
Note: I’m on Xbox so playing on steam is very much dependent on your PC. Also PC supposedly has some hackers so you may experience some even weirder things going on.
---
I haven't been able to move .38 or syringes, but 10mm and fuel flies off my shelves as fast as I can stock it.
---
Stranger in numbers is a 1 point card and they stack. But if your a low level you may not be messing with serums yet. Escape artist is useful and a 1point, but I'm guessing a lot of people have that on. I personally have been enjoying what ever is shared as haven't played with them all despite being a level 342.
---
Heres the honest truth, this season pass is meant for the diehard daily grinders of fallout 76 that spend 10 hours a day playing, not for the casual players who work full time jobs. That's ass backwards and needs to be changed, we already know Bethesda dont even play their own game and this is 50% of the problem with the season pass, the other is requiring Atoms to complete the season pass for those casual players. Its 2 of the biggest issues I've seen so far reading the posts.
---
can't even fast travel for free if you own it
---
I don’t know enough regarding the duping situation to comment on that, and I think it is certainly best if it is changed, but for me personally if Bethesda upped the exchange rate I would still use it with the interface it has now.
---
like shoulder length hair, I am still surprised that is not an option
---
yeah if you look at rank 100 in game it says it
---
I don't know what people were expecting out of this thing. If it wasn't a slow conversion rate people would just craft cheap 5mm and convert it into expensive ammo.
---
Read all the material around the cabins, they put some story to it all.
---
I’m still updating the game. Can someone give me the details as to what’s going on?
---
I don't have gamepass tho, things like those tend to cost a huge amount of money here in the Philippines. Lmao
---
Damn. I wish I could use both at once
---
Clean sink = dirty water :(
---
Another poorly thought out plan with half-ass implementation by Bethesda.   They could have done something really fun with this, but instead of actually testing it in reality with people that actually play the game, they come up with their theory of what should work and hey look at all the atoms people will buy, right?  People will just spend their money for ranks (in their mind).   Wrong.
---
Very disappointing to read about this so far.  I'll be getting on tonight and see first hand myself, but Ryuseru's experience with this tells me a lot.   I've done that stupid bullshit Camp Counselor event (can't think of the name right this moment) a TON.   I've hardly gotten any badges out of it.  I do Stings and Things every time I login.  I think I've unlocked \~3 backpacks now.   F-ing worst implementation of something that you could "earn" ever and it was bugged for months and months where you couldn't earn anything.  Instead of giving people a "we're sorry here's 20 badges" they just "fix it" without really actually fixing it.
---
So disappointed in Bethesda's path they've taken with FO76 so far.  I've taken my character up to level 240-something.  I've taken my alt characters up to over level 50 in hopes that their legendary effects per account is actually worth something when they get around to it. (Wasn't that supposed to be done 3 different times by now?)  Damn.
---
no why would you lmao
---
Hell yeah,  at least they got that part right!  I had a good experience too in the few events I had time to play!  Anyone else have a ridiculous amount of lag when viewing the legendary board though?
---
you made me laugh thanks!
---
lol, yes because "points" are important.  lol!  (people actually care about up or down votes?) 
---
I was just frustrated and venting a bit.  I was corrected,  so I'm good.
---
This is the post I hope Bethesda sees today - I'm also pretty sure my Furious rifle isn't Furious, but that seems to have been an issue for quite a while.
---
Refrigerators suck. 
---
The amount of time it takes me to put items in a fridge is the main reason I dont use them. Worthless.

I see this as their way of making people want to pay to earn ranks.  I haven't played yet and already felt like this was going to be a bit of grind.  It shouldn't separated, your character XP and SCORES XP.  They should go hand in hand at minimal.  Like other games do.
---
The Division 2 and Destiny 2 make it so you can earn rank fairly easy and quick.  All you need to do is either do bounties to earn more XP (Destiny 2) so you can rank up quickly across all of your characters since their all tied to the ranking system and their bounties are separate from each character or just play the game and what XP you earn, goes towards ranking up.
---
Bethesda implemented that right?  Where daily quests are separate on each character.  Never even really noticed or cared to pay that much attention to that.
---
I see, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the insight bruh
---
Will do. I’m playing NW most of the day!
---
farewell vault dweller.  
---
see you in fo5 :)
---
Great advice, i can already say with confidence I'm lucky that rank 82's SS armor ghillie is the last item I'd care to get. That's well ahead of the curve.
---
I have to go to camp for three weeks, so I feel like I will not make it
---
Let’s keep this going:
---
Player vending. 
---
Brewing.
---
That makes sense thank you
---
I can tell you if I played as much as I did during the first 3 months (8 or more hours a day), I would already be sitting at level 18. I just hit 10 and don't play more than 2 hours a day.. sometimes less.
---
I found a few but i dont thing all of them.
---
Same. I think I'm 1 level ahead of you on repair armor. After chest I believe it goes to repair power armor. I need to get to work on killing robot with various weapon types. Many of those are still in low hundreds for me.
---
You wouldn’t see it at all if they at least tried communicating on the state of f1st or what their plan for it are.
---
I feel you, I just caved in and bought mine from a player vendor. Still no plan.
---
The repeatable seems to help with that a bit but not by far a day saver. Also reports of public events giving 1000 would be a god send but i've not been lucky enough to get any.
---
All this ^^
---
I can’t believe what a pain in the arse it is to use this damn thing. I had a very reasonable 600 shotgun shells and it took me HUNDREDS of button taps to exchange it all into .45 rounds. 
---
My god, it’s like Bethesda designed this thing to be incredibly annoying to use just to encourage people to keep selling their ammo at vendors. Actually, that’s probably exactly what they intended. If it were easy to use, the in game economy for ammo would evaporate.  But then, why invest all the development effort into building this thing in the first place? It makes no sense!!
---
&lt;/rant&gt;

This is actually great advice. Thanks for sharing
---
I agree I dropped into an event team this morning and even though I don’t have a mic it was still a blast to have a few players and a bonus!
---
Bro I get. My apartment burned down after high school and wasn’t finished being built until a year and a half later. Light switches are upside down (one bedroom flips down one up), shower door is fucky fucky (slips off and lands on your feet) and I can’t use the microwave without my kitchen light flickering. 100% feel like it’s the same situation with F76
---
How much score did you get in 1 day of playing including public events?   I'm less interested in bugs / delay that made it hard to figure out which things added to your core than just trying to understand how much score can you get from playing a variety of things.   I wasn't able to login yesterday, so having an idea of someone else's experience would help me compare it to my own when I give it a try tonight.  Thanks!
---
I thought you meant level 100 and as a struggling level 81 trying to unlock that achievement, I completely agreed
---
What's ridiculous is that Bethesda thought it's a good idea to include NW in the SCORE system in the first place.
---
They'll just never learn that baiting people who just don't want to play PVP into playing PVP is a bad idea.
---
How many more bush wookies does this mode need?
---
And no, I'm not hating on bush wookies. Heck, I don't even play PVP because I don't like NW to begin with. Let the PVPers have fun, let the PVErs have fun but DON'T FUCKING MIX THOSE TWO.
---
And while we're at it, the level up bullshit needs to stop in general. I'm level 401, to level up 3 times I'd have to acquire around 49k XP. That's not very fun either.
---
Before the dailies reset I was getting score randomly. Even just sitting at my camp. It's not the 10k repeatable because I'm only 5k into that currently. It's not weeklies, since I finished those yesterday.
---
I'm assuming teammates were completing things, and I was also getting the credit. It might be a bug, and I really hope they do not fix it. More incentive to be on public teams. 
---
But reaching Rank 13 in less than 48 hours? I'm not complaining.
---
I am complaining about doing 7 events and only one counting for the daily 3. Already have a ticket in, but probably won't hear anything for 2 or 3 weeks.
---
Absolutely this! I just did a post about this. The grind is killing the game for me. I paid like 60 bucks or less for this game. I've gotten a year of enjoyment out of it. Things are starting to feel grindy and boring and I'm starting to hate logging in...so I'm done. I enjoyed my time and got what I feel like is a decent trade off
---
I had like 80 .38 rounds to load. Felt like it took an eternity.
---
I don't feel like there was a complete story given to us, but yes, you are right, they are cursed! :)
---
I know right it’s very interactive and fun, I didn’t know It would be such a blast!
---
They should but if you read the info tag (main screen) ingame it doesn't mention events at all
---
I had a funny experience just the other day where I had 20 kills, 1 person left, Scorchbeast pounding me royally with her scorch burps and the lone remaining bush wookie starts shooting me in the bum while I was trying to get away from those burps.
---
Jumped up when I got shot in the ass and whipped around trying to see where the wookie was but was hard to see due to being in nuke zone.  Saw them while I was coming down from the jump up at the last second and started shooting at them and killed myself due to the Gauss splash back cause I was too close to the ground lol.
---
Wookie won with no kills and I was dying laughing.  Must of been a rush for the person, I would have been pumped in their situation, well played whoever you were, well played lol.
---
It's not glitched for me as far as I can tell, but I would make use of that if i were you. It's not just the 10 scrip (and what, 60 caps?) per server hop, there's also 1300 exp (without buffs) at no ammo cost, and that means 100 S.C.O.R.E. every eighth hop. Not too shabby.
---
One thing is that we used to get a pop-up when we completed a weekly, now I am getting nothing, no notice.
---
I don't use adrenaline, I run junkies. It's just that high damage is bugged.
---
At this point does it really surprise you though
---
I was prepared to give it a try and it was really cool. Shows you how open players are and makes it easy to either stay solo or find a team if wanted
---
I am drowning in all of these words, so please excuse if this is already been said: WHY NOT PUT AMMO SWAPPING FUNCTIONALITY INTO THE AMMO MACHINES AT EVERY TRAIN STATION?! 
---
I mean, part of any FO76 session involves going by a train station at least once. Dump ammo, get tokens or coupons or whatever, cash in at any other train station at any other time. 
---
They could still implement their terrible "buy high, sell low" robbery on their exchange rates and probably implement some sort of anti-duping technology on the backside.
---
As an aside, has anyone figured out how to use this thing as a base budget exploit yet? Because, you know that's going to happen sooner or later.
---
Bethesda’s motto.
---
Completionist by definition is a chore
---
I don’t like most of the rewards to be honest. I just want all that wallpaper and I’ll be good.
---
Considering it's been over 24 hours since the update and this is the first anyone is hearing of this I'm going to go out on a limb and say Adreneline is not broken.
---
Honestly, I CAN believe it.
---
Goodbye and I hope you have some other game to go to. I am also taking a break until One Appalachia is released. Seasons are bad in all games, but Beth somehow was able to make it's even worse.
---
I like the game, but breaks are good when something bad happens.
---
Defend Charleston junkyard I think.  I was on 4 person public team.  I don't know the amount
---
Your math was so close. Total weekly/dailies add to 21,500 for week including NW. 
---
I am happy to see someone saying the correct total score though. So many people roll it one extra level.
---
The delta between challenges and score is only 5,275. 
---
Also people are reporting that public events are giving score (as intended per Bethesda FAQ)
---
Also means that over 1/4 of the atoms is in the last 11 rounds of grind. (Somewhere from 11-22 hours according to Bethesda)
---
And many people say doing all the dailies/weeklies isn't enough to reach rank 100 on its own
---
Keep it hush so people can hit rank 100 out of spite for Beth making it a tedious daily chore to hit. 😤
---
Spill the tea to me tho, maybe? :&gt;
---
This is why seasons did not compel me to return to the game.
---
Everything Bethesda does looks good from 10 feet away, but as you approach, you start seeing slots to feed money into.
---
Thanks, Im enjoying other games.
---
I've had 2 win with out firing a shot, 1 win with 2 kills at the very end, and 3 matches where the circle has fully closed haha
---
i got only 3 new one they where the same from yesterday
---
What the. I only hit post once  :(
---
On behalf of some of us that have better things to do with our time, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted. Pragmatism and perspective doesn't go over well around here, evidently.
---
Agreed, just turn back the season pass systen into old atom job system we will be fine. At least you got the team up system right.
---
This glitch still exsisting coupled with how much score you'll need is an embarassment.
---
Adrenaline is broken bro it doesn’t stack you can may things and won’t work
---
What if we bought the Power Armor Edition for 200 dollars and never got our actual canvas bag though
---
I can, 100% ...
---
I was pretty let down after reading that wiki and trying it a thousand times with no luck.
---
Tyvm
---
See you there comrade :')
---
I have not played for a while what is deal with the levels.
---
This goes to show that the PTS is only there to keep up appearances and trick us into thinking that they are even slightly on top of the ball when it comes to testing and quality control. It's damage control.
---
Dunno why you've been downvoted, here's an upvote for fair points you have here.
---
I think that both modes should've had separate sets of challenges with equal rewards so people would not be forced to play the modes they don't really like to get every possible reward.
---
But hell, that's Bethesda, they just continue burying their game with all these mediocre (to say the least) and poorly conceived/thought out additions month after month.
---
Especially with a fatman launcher the nuke just goes through the ground
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj7wqb/seasons_i_did_the_math_and_it_isnt_pretty/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Thats just one of many
---
But is it stacking
---
With gauss guns it seems to be a bit better after update - I have noticed that now VATS ℅ to hit changes as the boss (like SBQ turns or is getting far). Previously it was showing 95℅ no matter what is the real hit chance. There are still a lot of point blank misses in a row with 95℅ displayed though.
---
That’s shitty and I feel for you, but I at least hope you got a lesson about pre-ordering games or buying at launch before reviews come out. In modern world, the primary reason to pre-order (reserving a copy) is completely obsolete.
---
Always wait a month or so before buying a new, extremely-hyped game.
---
Damn straight.
---
ahahahaha
---
Seem some say you have to be the one nuking to get the 1000, though I can't confirm it as I spend all my nukes collecting flux xD
---
Besides, I'm not even sure the game has any way to tell who launched the nuke connecting with killing the queen, unless they added it just for this (in which case, why even?).
---
Public events are supposed to grant score points, per Bethesda. Once that is fixed this will be much more attainable.
---
There's several spots and I think they upped the chances to 10%. If you go and it's not there, kill everything and return in 5/10 mins.
---
In two weeks, you will get your chance. 150 Atoms per level.
---
Wow that sucks as you need that
---
I do whatever takes my fancy in FO76 and get atoms, challenges etc completed.
---
The new SCORE system means I got stuff for free that I might have spent atoms to buy in the shop.
---
I am ultra casual - less than 1 hr to 2 per day.
---
I really don't see what all the fuss is about myself?
---
Getting atoms and rewards seems easy to me and I couldn't care less about min/maxing or grinding.  I just do what I want and if I get a reward......bonus!
---
Major team bug in Nuclear Winter on xbox at least where we all get kicked from the team after the NW match ends.   Have to re-invite everybody to the team every single time....
---
How did you get 'Very Well Rested'? I've never seen that before.
---
Preach!
---
Still happening? Looks like it got fixed :( 
---
#bushwookiees4life
---
Because they want you to buy Atoms.
---
I'm taking a break from the game for a while. I'm just too frustrated with the direction Bethesda is going.
---
I really hope it won’t end up being a stingy amount either if it is a bug. Hopefully bigger events reward more SCORE, but since this is Bethesda, I’d imagine 100 per public event at the very least?
---
Yes, because despite people bigging it up to handwave the potential issue, it's 100 SCORE per 10k xp. If you put Rank 1 in a vacuum and tried to earn it via the repeatable you would need 10,000 xp for that lone, solitary, rank. And they get more expensive. It's an extra 100 Score every four Ranks. Even exploiting the fuck out of xp buffs/foods/Unyielding, it's hundreds of thousands of xp to make up for the expected shortfall even if you did everything every day.
---
The only hope is that the Ranks reset back to 1000 at the start of each section of the board, which would bring the numbers down somewhat.
---
Ah! Yeah, missed that the level up was 500 and not 250. Will edit. :)
---
Wait, since when do they fix things?!
---
Oh, it's nightmare fuel!
---
Just saw were fallout 76 is coming to game pass for Xbox and PC. Free to play model in full effect right as they drop SCORE. Coincidence I think not.
---
This.
---
&gt; daily challenges)
---
Have tried another ticket though the that catagory, crossing fingers.  
---
From talking in discord groups, I've seen this happen to other people too!
---
They are awarded as part of the progress you make on the season board thing. They warned us up front that we'll be getting less atoms.
---
I think the idea is more that we'll be awarded stuff we want anyway, so not spending as much either. Like the clean sink, ammo convertor (which needs some serious rethinking), etc.
---
Yeah I got my copy as a gift. But was probably bought for around the £40 mark. I'm well over 1k hours in, by far the most I've put into a single game. I think I've gotten my friends moneys worth out of it
---
Not really
---
Doesn't different characters have different NW levels? Make a new toon, easy levels. I do the adventure mode level challenges the same way since it's harder to level with a 500+ lv main.
---
You also get 100 score for gaining 10k xp I think that is infinitely repeatable.
---
This is a dude that I’ve played Xbox consistently with for over two years. If your friends would do that to you, might I suggest you find some better friends. I assure you this is not the case lmao.
---
No idea. My guess is it has something to do with BOS. What’s interesting is it looks exactly like an event I suggested a year ago...
---
Yes! This is the reason why I have stopped using the M79 grenade launcher. The 40mm bullets are good for early to mid-game, but prove inefficient at higher levels.
---
I have decided I end up where I end up on the season.  Don’t sweat it so bad. The rewards aren’t amazing.
---
No not the regular one, the new quest, a colossal problem, its a unique colossus you can fight. Its like scorched earth
---
Leveling is a big theme with the repeatable too. Listed a bunch of tricks for that in this post:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj9p7o/everything\_you\_need\_to\_know\_about\_score\_rank/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj9p7o/everything_you_need_to_know_about_score_rank/) 
---
Use as many as you can. If you aren't bloodied with UNY gear I feel sorry as that's the biggest booster.
---
I tried adding myself into my own group on private server 20 times earlier for the "join 20 groups" trophy but it didn't work haha.
---
Yeah i was logged on when it rolled over.
---
I'm not sure how the event plays out (I have the Steam version so never got to try out the PTS) but I have fought two Wendigo Bosses in the pink forest after fighting the Scorchbeast Queen. With this update, it brings a flat 10% chance of the Wendigo Colossus to spawn in the nuke areas it could spawn in. Head there after a SBQ fight and see if it popped up.
---
Could we get a list of things that has worked with so far?
---
Your quitting just because of 1 reward?
---
Does inspirational work even if I am the only one in the team?
---
The Gauss pistol is really nice. It makes gunslinger a viable endgame build.
---
Is it broken? Looks like I'm wasting special points.
---
I know, but 150 atoms means thats 1 less score rank to farm
---
That was the joke, dude.
---
Yeah that wont happen. It is just hard enough that you will use the little atoms you get from it to advance the last few spaces thus not getting any atoms to spend in the atomic shop
---
I played for 2.5 hrs last night (8pm to 10.30), did some events and general wandering about.
---
Played for an hour and a half this afternoon after picking up the kids from school while they played/ate dinner. Did some events that spawn decent enemies (the ones where you defend turrets from scorchbeasts).
---
Ive done the dailys, all the weeklies. Ive also done the 10k XP repeatable mission 11 times, and I dont have a fully maxed INT build (no unyielding). This puts me at rank 11 about to roll onto rank 12 on day 2 of the event, with not a huge amount of play time.
---
Having a good base INT helps for XP, and egghead + herd mentality + strange in numbers boosts this up, but you can hit the 10k XP multiple times in one play session without particularly trying (presuming you go to events etc)
---
Lunchbox
---
Two hrs huh? That’s a fuckin riot.
---
Just do what everyone that hates Bethesda does...play it for thousands of hours and get a 1st membership.
---
It only averages out to 8-10 hours a day 6-7 days a week. You know, because they're disappointed.
---
I can but the first shot almost always misses.
---
There are a total of 1500 atoms available with this system. That’s roughly a months worth of atoms in the old system (give or take).
---
So does PC not let you do faves from the pip boy? I keep seeing people say the favorite wheel isn't enougb...but I don't use the wheel for that and I have everything I use favorited.
---
Yea i was bummed for the same reason about the leveling thing with my 500+ main. Until i realized that i could make a new alt and do quick levels with him. And when he gets past those easy first levels i delete him and make new one. And just so you know, the first level up inside vault 76 does not count as the toon is not in the game world yet (wish it would).
---
Sidebar, but did they ever fix the Possum Badge drops? I keep getting 50 dumb caps for those dailies, and the Campfire Tales is unreliable.
---
I agree with that, even the enclave part. That would be cool in a way if part of a quest you could help them take back whitesprings and make it like the new white house of the wasteland or something
---
It is. Battle passes are supposed to be fun. This the biggest chore I've seen yet in this game
---
We've been asking for this since the day this game came out. 
---
Instead of adding quantity sliders, even small ones like 10 a pop, they'll get rid of the hunger/thirst requirements and make cooking optional for buffs. Without adding quantity sldiers, I might add.
---
Yeh, no doubt...and the reward for converting our hard earned stockpiles are  again an insignificant return.
---
Bethseda apparantley loves releasing all the extremely grindy crap in the wrong places to F76.
---
Wow....pragmatism...can..can I touch you? I'm in awe!
---
Yea, it sounds great, but it doesn’t work. It would’ve been insane if it drew agro away from you. So if a Deathclaw was charging, chuck it and you’ve got a few seconds to get to a better position
---
the only thing they seem to know exists from new Vegas is literally the armor on the cover 
---
feels bad man I just want slugs and flechettes and shit back
---
I never thought about that. Thank you very much for suggesting that lmao
---
Ok thank you! I may start playing NW then lol
---
Rename them.
---
I bought the Fixer plan for 100 (one hundred) caps. Couldn't believe my eyes and luck. And got a 3* bloodied Lever rifle for 500 caps within 30 mins. I did compensate them partially by spending thousands on items I don't need. Some of these vendors don't know value but most overvalue.
---
Destiny lead Luke Smith: "We hear and understand the concerns of FOMO and we're taking steps to get rid of it"
---
Bethesda: "EAT THIS BOWL OF FOMO'S O'S CEREAL!"
---
I've got a low health pistolero. He's my weakest build but viable. Pretty fun to play with as well. I rely on vats and use .44s mostly. The 10mm just doesn't pack the wallop i need
---
You make it sound like putting responsibility first is a bad thing....
---
Look, we know people are assholes when it comes to prices sometimes, and I am also done with everyone making their house floating and whatever.
---
Just shrug it off, say "asshole" in your head, and move on, no need for a big show.
---
It's those weeklys that will boost that up I'm only level 8/9 on it and still have 2 weeklys left.
---
How did they mess up seasons? Or the party system? And throwing hissy fits over literally everything gets old save it for real issues wrong with the game, spamming the same thing about a non issue does nothing.
---
Saw this yesterday and it made me happy.  Just drop it off for the next person!
---
And there is probably going to be those almost impossible to do kill Scorpions, RadAnts, Megasloths daillies. If you skip those and nw ones its going to be hella tough
---
Like the game itself I Like it but I don't Love it.
---
Once you get used to it the biggest issue is that horrid small scrap limit. It needs a line added that offers to max the scrapper up to its token limit.
---
Oh and the screen needs expanding. Fine its a Terminal and so appears as a screen inside a screen but half the world can still be viewed round the edges whilst the text is shrunk in the middle.
---
Anyway its nice not to have to throw away Mini Nukes and 40mm anymore.
---
It was on PS4
---
Yeah that should come with the next update hopefully!
---
That seems unusual. I got from zero to level 6 in two and a half hours today. Did you get your SCORE points each time?
---
"FO76 fans"
---
*Half of subreddit full of bs complaints about everything taking too long and people too lazy to play*
---
Think about that one pal...
---
I was dicking around doing other stuff too but it really doesn't take long to do the daily challenges. They also made them easier. Although I did cop a squatter and I literally had to clear outside and inside of the freaking glassed cavern. So that added time to my completion time. Plus I rolled a junkies plasma caster and just had to try it out.
---
np :)
---
In the interim, I did meet Mr. Veterinarian and his band of cat followers but Murgle was AWOL in my visits to Welch and Mt. Blair.
---
So should you direct those feelings toward discouraging the consumer for complaining about not getting what they paid for or toward the company that profited from deceptive marketing practices?
---
Aquaboy is great. No rads when wading in water is nice.
---
I think in Bethesda's mind, events already do provide SCORE, since you get XP for them.
---
Happened to me yesterday. You can’t put shielded on a lined one, you have to build a new one. Presto.
---
Commrade??? Does someone need me to kick their ass??!!?
---
If you don't know wat score is, where have you been? Living under a rock? Check the patch notes for God sake
---
This. Pretty simple
---
Stop expecting this game to be the same as other fallout games ita fundamentally different. If u wanna be by urself pay for the private server or play another fallout. They have just as much right to play like that as u do complaining about it
---
I noticed this as well yesterday. I had a few that would give me the points but not mark as completed until i finished every goal on the list.
---
Why I have to pay more to enjoy the game?? I can colaborate with random players but is not funny when 4 idiots are killing the enemy without give you time to help or do anything.
---
And you’ll get atoms monthly to customize more things. Good suggestion!
---
My point exactly
---
Unpopular opinion here, but honestly just walk away from the game.  Its about the only way theyre going to get it.
---
Im a massive Fallout fan.  Ive probably spent over $1000 on games, bobble heads, special editions, and other random merch, and I just cant justify it anymore.  I played faithfully from beta to the point they nerfed explosions and I walked away for a bit.  Came back just before wastelanders and played till I completed everything other than the tedious faction grinds and I finally said “fuck it” and threw in the towel for good.  I love the fallout world and lore, but I cant pretend this isnt some 3rd rate piece of shit game anymore.  Im done and honestly I hope more walk so in these guys finally understand.
---
: D
---
Honestly I'm glad it's a grind. I know it's lame but it gives me something to do. It also makes the higher level items more fun to get if you grind for it.
---
"Enjoy what you do and you'll never work a day in your life."
---
I enjoy completing collections. I do not enjoy this system.
---
I said it before this launched, and I’m saying it now. 
---
These seasons were never anything more than hopping on the “Battle Pass” bandwagon. A lot of people are going to buy their way up to 100 once they see the season coming to an end and they aren’t anywhere close. 
---
Wait until the next one.
---
Agreed. I don't even participate in it. Rewards are lame ass hell.
---
Ahhhh thanks.

https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d9lb0a/event_idea_build_a_town/

That was my event idea that it looked like but will check pip boy
---
oh wow, good point
---
I know - it is either a drought or flooding in this game with players.
---
It's a multiplayer game and those are public events. Keyword public.
---
Not surprised. One step forward 7 steps back is all I've come to expect from BGS.
---
i was wondering about that... I'll try it.
---
I nuke em
---
Lol. I give this thing I don't understand a low rating. Fix it Bethesda, otherwise I might have to spend 3 minutes of my life reading about this incredibly simple system.
---
i scripped a troubleshooters chest one tired night a while ago, oops.
---
rename the armor, so it stands out.  or a small silver lining for seasons, apply the ghillie suit paint to all your armor, once you unlock them.  sure itll look awful, but having a paint on it will prevent it from showing up in the vendor and legendary exchange screens.
---
Step 1. While they don't need to remove ammo points limit, it does need to increase 10x or more.
---
Step 2. Figure out price per round, and use a slider to sell rounds. All sell-able ammo types you have in your inventory are shown, like a transfer menu.
---
Step 3. You buy from converter like you would from a vendor bot, but using points instead of caps.
---
Yeah, I’m so excited about public teams. I’ve always been a solo player and I love doing events, so it’s nice to have people to do events with and get the benefits of being on a team. First time I passed Radiation Rumble! I also love how low pressure teams are. You can really just do your thing while still getting the benefits of being on a team. The free fast travel and cap drops when your teammate completes a quest are also pretty cool. Overall, I think it’s a great addition.
---
What's weird is I have no idea how this under armor even got modded in the first place? I haven't ever put any mods on it until now.
---
I thought the whole problem people had with cosmetics is it isn’t worked for just paid for and now people get something that’s a real grind unless you shell out ridiculous amounts (fair enough) and people still complain...
---
It’s not that much of a grind, i’m already level 10 and sure it’s gonna slow down but I done all my daily’s today in an hour and a half...
---
Fingers, toes and eye's crossed. Have you fought the existing one?
---
Better than raining cats and dogs I suppose.
---
There are lots of other cards to share though. Even something that seems silly at rank one can be useful to non-min-maxers. For example a lot of the Endurance cards.
---
I only wish the flatwoods monster dropped loot specific to him. Like a unique legendary or something
---
Do you not see the big "The Legendary Run" on your start screen? It's a Board Game screen where you redeem cometics and stuff you get from this season from SCORE points, which took the place of Atom Daily/Weeklies.
---
Perhaps try going to the legendary run board and claim what you unlock and don’t rate something until u understand how it works
---
Scribbled Code On Reversed Envelope
---
That's one way to do it. Bit overkill but I like it.
---
yesterday i completed the dailies and weekly stuff, logged in today looked at the dailies and man i just can not be bothered to repeat these chores again. it's like when i started the gold bullion grind... didn't take long before i swore i'd never do another public event again. imo, introducing a new grind this soon after the bullion grind became a thing is not optimal. already burnt out. that being said, i did unlock everything of value from wastelanders (ss, t65, minigun, etc etc) so maybe i'll find motivation for this... but it won't be this week.
---
Was a fun game to me before the "Public teams" patch
---
So it's okay to bitch about bitching on the fo76 sub but you can't bitch about the actual game unless Dr. Sad Panda approves it as a "real issue".  
---
Yeah bro that boat don't float.
---
If you mean when you die then you don’t reapawn then yes
---
Now, how many atoms do we need?
---
People wanted things to do. They gave you things to do. Now you're saying there's too many things to do.
---
Yes twice, was it fun? Sorta, its better then having to deal with a flying thing that will never land
---
Honest people don’t care about your lvls 
---
Public group are just people playing together for the exp bonus they rather have a lvl1 for the bonus then no player
---
Not fixed, but even made it way worse. This never happened this way on an off day, before, the only issue was the Tuesday rollover with weeklies if you played NW at the time or if you checked out the Atomic Store before logging into a server.
---
I noticed my uncharged shots doing less than what the damage numbers imply, all my pellets are doing around 500 to 700 per pellet on a headshot which should be 4500+ damage uncharged on a headshot yet it takes multiple shots to kill a lv50 super mutant, that definitely doesn’t seem right, super mutants at that level don’t even have that much hp, my shotgun is definitely doing less damage than the numbers imply, fully charged shots are fine, a fully charged shot can one shot a legendary scorchbeast out of the sky if I’m close enough.
---
On top of what everyone else has said I'll add this sort of thing happened before yesterday's patch.
---
I picked up a JE Assault Rifle for 8k.
---
That was a dammn good day.
---
People know prices, just there are a few who think to be funny.
---
Man I need that very well rested for real life 😐
---
So your entire review is based on you not knowing about seasons? Look at the legendary run menu lol
---
I mean one of the challenges is complete X public events and it gives score.
---
I mean I said you can complain about other issues? Issues that actually plague the game but complaining and freaking out about things that don’t matter as much just flood there bug forums etc, and you never addressed the point about what was wrong with this update.
---
One of my friends had 3 auto complete today as well on the reset, not cool..
---
 If your proof is solid enough, then i know for a fact they CAN give you Atoms. So how much score did you miss out on? Each rank is 150 ATOMs, so its its 7500, that's about roughly 5 ranks. Sounds like 750 ATOMs should be thrown your way.
---
Nah, if Bethesda is willing to drag fallout through the dirt, they will eventually do the same with all their games.
---
You can also start a new toon just for the level ups. It significantly reduces the time to level up for those.
---
It is pretty disappointing but just imagine if they decided to put a price on the legendary run like other games with their “battle passes”, that would get people really mad.
---
Whoa! +100%
---
I live in a literal radiation dump, be glad you have a bog.
---
nonstop grinds with nothing to play/use after getting the stuff . ESO has tons and tons of so many different activities and avenues to focus on that yes are technically grinds but theres always something to take a break on to go onto something else without feeling stressed out. Plus most of the stuff is fun and feels like your accomplishing stuff well.
---
We don’t want all the hacked weapons we hear about lol.
---
Nah... I was getting fun before this "Public Teams" update....
---
I was doing my random stuff alone and colaborating with randoms on the public events. But now??? now i have to deal with some teams of 4 players with 200+ level xd
---
Ha yeah you could say that.
---
The wheel has 12 slots. 5 armour and 2 rare clothes is 7. Plus 4 weapons that leaves me with just 1 slot. But I have 5 other meds I like to keep hot keyed. Once the wheel is full with 12 it won't let you favourite anything else. I think being a PC player we love our hotkeys. Always been used to that feature but 76 is a console game first so we get the shaft. With the legendary run they didn't even change the PC version. It tells us to use the D-pad. So it's just a terrible console port. Sadness.
---
You might be blind. Outside of the Converter being terrible this is like the number one complaint if you sort by new.
---
The one in the event is much stronger
---
That would be completely fine if there wasn’t a freaking minigun that took the same ammo
---
Saw another post yesterday saying that once the guy learned the treated plan it just auto implemented to his underarmor, so sounds like some weird bug.
---
That does seem like a fun idea though, I’d like to see something like that. 
---
If what I’ve read and heard through data mines and “quest” names, it looks like this new community building thing will be related to the broadcast I mentioned. It seems like a cool idea, but stay away from those posts and such if you don’t want spoilers! I know I would’ve really enjoyed finding out about this through the world, I think it will be a cool storyline
---
This is really smart. I'm doing this. Thank you friend.
---
I'd just direct it to one of the other posts.
---
It's like the ammo machine, about 20 posts about it today, what's wrong with all commenting in the same thread instead of posting a new one every time? Becomes tiresome to look through.
---
Okay got it.  Youre fine with bitching about bitching but not the actual game unless you personally view it as a "real issue".  Get over yourself lmfao.  You're not better or smarter than somebody just because you don't find the same things they do frustrating...wtf.
---
There is a time and place for everything.  A subreddit is as good a place as any and as for timing there is no better time then when it's fresh and relevant.
---
Because a huge part of any MMO fanbase are players who feel the need to collect every piece of useless junk that exists to make up for the lack of meaningful gameplay they encounter post end-game.And for developers, it's a lot easier to create these carrot-dangling mechanics than it is to expand the map, write new questlines, introduce new NPCs, new Legendary enemies - you know, what actually makes it a decent game.  
---
I'm looking forward to that in the fall update more than any of this SCORE stuff.
---
I read the ITV article about scores and stuff I didnt know Bethesda was gonna nerf the easy atom points.
---
It can be done. Took me about 2 hours to knock out most of the weekly stuff. This time, anyway.
---
They should actually have pride in their own game and actually play it. They more often than not, appear to have no interest in either.
---
Also people are thinking the points from Encryptid are from the kill robots challenge. It's hard to tell when the notifications aren't showing up at the right time.
---
This happened to me on two of the weekly SCORE rewards last night. One of them seemed to have unstuck and paid up once I finished another daily SCORE challenge while the other one is still sitting in limbo unrewarded. I noticed on both instances of glitched challenge, it would grey out the challenge like it had been completed but held on to the marker showing I was tracking its progress. Almost like the game half thought I was still trying to track and complete while also assuming I had completed it. I hope that 1k SCORE lands into my account tonight when I log in...it was a biggun.
---
Each rank is 150 atoms. So its simple (ranks\*150) for what you want to spend it on. Do as much as you can. Since S.C.O.R.E. scales with each rank its best to wait until last minute to buy since you are getting more bang for your buck.
---
whole thing with no S.C.O.R.E. earned would cost you 14,850 though...
---
Thats the most wild shit ive ever heard of in a mmo lol.
---
Yeah honestly I'm getting sick of this, the entire update feels like a cash grab with a thin curtain of "oh no it's not *look* we are not allowing you to buy your way to the end for the first *couple weeks* see how much of a cash grab this isn't, see guys" I'm probably just going to uninstall the game at this point
---
My first SBQ of the day went down in less than 30s sucking the fun out. I simply saved ammo as I knew I wouldn't hit the minimum.
---
But other than that its been more lively with little sign of the idiots or OP players. I'm also a solo player but soloing public events are demoralising on a public server and having randoms turn up adds some colour at least. 
---
You can start your own team and take advantage of the bonuses. There nothing that says you can't still play your own game, and tbh 4x solo players on a team is free bonuses all round. I never saw one team of 4 and yet free xp still came in each time they completed quests or events.
---
I dont never pause the game while im in world and I must have missed it upon startup.
---
Yep, it's a bit turnoff.
---
Remember, speak with your wallet. Not happy with something, zip it up so they see the mistake.
---
Aye, it can run pretty bloody fast too!
---
Wait what?
---
demotivational is a good word to describe many design decisions in this game
---
Yes! Anyone who says other wise is a commie and will answer to Mr. Gutsy personally.
---
I think it's meant to be super rare.
---
I saw a similar post before I hopped on yesterday. Got pretty pumped and got on the game, ready run thru some events. No exaggeration, not 1 single event labeled group I joined were doing events. I'd always find the leader at a players house or just dicking around...the other players scattered throughout the map.
---
Rumbling? Like does your screen shake? I was at my camp last night across from Slocum Joe's and my screen started shaking like something was rumbling. I was on the phone and didn't have my headphones on so I don't know what it sounded like or had the ability at the time to look around to see what was causing it. I'm chalking it up to Dunwich Horror shenanigans. There's a theory that that story is running deep through the newer Fallout games and might rear it's head in this one in a big way.
---
Better than raining Scorchbeasts and ending up feeling like you fell asleep inside a tarpaulin drying factory....Wings Everywhere!
---
I have a shotgun/pistol build. They keep making shotguns more and more worthless. I may go full blown pistol build.
---
Like, the criticisms are valid, but we don't need 30 posts in a row about Ammo Converter bad (which it is, don'tcha know?)
---
It was 1700 for me now its 1900 :((
---
They also have to fix the 3rd person crosshair bug that displays the middle of it incorrect. Its in bethesda games since fallout 3. Always had to download a mod fix for this.
---
Of course we all know now we’ve just read OP’s PSA
---
Your mindset is a form of gaslighting that we see everywhere today. “Police don’t kill you if you break the law”, well breonna Taylor was sleeping so maybe the police are the problem. If we were all more vocal about the problems of this game it would alienate Bethesda enough to do something about it. Instead genuine valid complaints are downvoted or glossed over unless the post volume is simply too much to ignore.
---
You’re basically saying “me having to hear about your problem is worse than the problem you’re having”
---
What? All I said was the mire was beautiful and I wished there was more events / story in it?? Going through post history but can’t answers questions lol
---
You. Posted. About. The. Mire. 6. Days. Ago.  Go away hypocrite.  You're just pissed because your fanboy unpopular opinion isn't getting the upvotes you hoped.  Because youre not only wrong youre a hypocrite.
---
My manufacturing facilities were the stuff of legends. I had an ammo drop box piped directly into my house with switches for type. Ah man.
---
not for 2000c
---
99.9% need not apply o7
---
they already have the code for the legendary exchange machine, its the same mechanics!
---
If you have people to play with, Go for it.
---
Alone? Still a good buy, but difficult to get the hang of if you haven't played any other fallout especially 4. 
---
If you like grinding your ass off for good gear and feel accomplished when you finally get that dope armor/weapon, ye. If you are lazy, nah.
---
Depends on how you look at games.
---
About bugs... depends on what you see as a bug. I have a few crashes on PC, but my PC is also pretty old, maybe a bit too old. Getting an upgrade soon though, but off topic...
---
Graphic bugs definitely exist, enemies not dying when they should, not getting rewards for certain challanges and a few more minor things are common here, but nothing gamebreaking.
---
As someone who has 800h+, I can say it's super fun if you have someone to play with, but the endgame gets boring really quick.
---
Try it, on steam you can always refund I think.
---
Did you.... read the plan??
---
Had the exact same challenges ticked off on xbox
---
You’re clearly just angry over nothing and freaking out, my mire post was PRAISING how the mire looked and just wished more quests/events took place in it, what is wrong with you?
---
explore the area and you'll find the answer.
---
People worry too much about the SBQ not landing. She's not landing because people are standing in dumb places and stagger her... If you run into that just take it as a free Scorched Earth for yourself. I mean seriously, people still kill her even though she's in air... I haven't seen a failed Scorched Earth in months. If you arrive and people are being dumb just get your 1000 or so damage so you qualify for loot and let the idiots waste their ammo. If she ends up landing than sure, unload into her face, but until than just hang out. She'll spawn legendaries that'll be all yours because everyone else is too busy wasting their ammo. They will kill her, you'll get all the rewards and save a bunch of your ammo. And than come here and laugh when people make posts about the Queen being a bullet sponge.
---
Perfectly calm dude.
---
&gt;Seems most games are taking notes from mobile games
---
I've been saying this for years. In my college classes ten years ago, they talked about how much the mobile gaming market is growing and how companies need to merge their traditional games with them. I bet I could bring out powerpoint slides and point to what Bethesda is doing because its almost exact same model from them. A shame, a real fucking shame.
---
Cryolator
---
I don’t want to be shamed for mentioning this game, but the fortnite battle/season pass had the exact same difficulty. You had to do every mission they gave you for the whole season AND play tons of extra matches to get enough points or whatever to get to rank 100. This goes for other games with seasons too. It’s not easy to reach 100 in modern warfare.
---
Are you sure it was not a Nukashine^TM?
---
“Signs and letters” I bought it from the brotherhood vendor. It just unlocked the neon stuff .-. Wow
---
IF ONLY we could navigate the dialogue/menu by number input then I could do it ten times faster.
---
It sucks but I've managed to swap out all my ammo to ballistic, which doesn't weigh anything if I carry it.
---
Now to sell my half empty fusion cores and plasma cores because it's only ammo when it's convenient but not if I want to convert it!
---
It’s been nice to have moved away from loot boxes... but at what costs?
---
Nobody is really sure because nobody has tested (that is, risked atoms in the past just to figure it out).
---
Auto completing challenges seem to have a strong connection to nuclear winter however.
---
Wait, what? How?!
---
Also you're lying
---
&gt;I think each area should have like a scorch beast queen type event mire should have like say 4 events one after another of defending pods than the final is a massive strangler heart and however many pods you saved weaken it.
---
Omg yes, love it
---
But the ITV article straight up said you would not earn very many atoms with the new system.
---
As for the stuff you've unlocked go to the "legendary run" option to open the game board and click the spots you've already completed to unlock the rewards.  I Didn't understand why you needed to manually claim the rewards at first but some of them are scrip and caps.  Think it's there so you won't be given 150 scrip if you are already at or close to max.
---
Wtf do u mean parties has always been a thing? So do u want people to stop how they play to cater to how u play? why r u so special lmao? The only difference now is more people do events and if ur upset about that then your upset by how the game is supposed to be played. You are literally conplaining about how people enjoy their game. Shut up
---
Sounds like they are quantifying the changes.
---
*laughs in X-COM*
---
That's the stuff, I remember it being neon blue in a large jug
---
Depends what you see as "good"
---
Do you want a resource at your camp?
---
Are you selling with a vending machine?
---
Do you rather want to have a sweet home in the middle of nowhere so no one bothers you?
---
I actually can't believe you are using that as an example to try and say I'm gaslighting about an opinion on a post about a video game subscription. Grow up, it's not that serious.
---
That math might be flawed. Regarding that I already made it to level 10 in just one day (and I logged off before the dailies reset, so there's at least two more levels waiting for me tonight) and even if taking into account that I'll need more points for each higher level, I'm more concerned that I'll hit 100 in four weeks or so, and will lose my major incentive to continue playing until season two.
---
Ya not sure what that guy is on about, they made it clear why no NPCs were in the game and only changed stance when it was one of the biggest complaints about the game.
---
I am sorted by new, how else do you think I saw this post? Seriously, if Adreneline was broken nobody would be talking about the ammo converter right now.
---
Same reason you can't sell anything bought with bullion.
---
user the contractor perk to reduce the quantity of materials required.
---
after that, just have to shop or farm.
---
What system are you on?
---
Put out a skin for a weapon people dont use?  Doesn't make sense monetarily for bethesda...
---
Lying about what?!?! A suggestion? You’re reaching here dude go calm down. Rest of the post is praising and putting out ideas? Lol I wasn’t complaining about anything, just saying what I would like to see in future updates.
---
Not an endless loop... if you just select main menu the hit back once your good to go.
---
I’m noticing vats and sneak cards are not mentioned. You like commando ok without it?
---
CNN\*
---
We know m8. The countless other posts explain this very clearly, and most people have already unlocked it and found it out.
---
this has to be a bug, otherwise, you would need complete ever challenge every day and week and gain more than 55 levels worth of XP above LVL 100 to complete the season.
---
Its only got a 5 minute window to start, very easy to miss. Haven’t noted a trigger (proximity doesn’t seem to do it)
---
If you put an ! In front of them it puts them all at the top of your inventory. Then just deal with what's below.
---
No.
---
I pre-ordered F76 and put in about 100 hours. For me, even considering how little money I make, thats well worth the $60 I paid. I've been playing F3 the past couple weeks cuz i never played any of the dlc's. I picked up a goty copy at a pawnshop for $10. I've put in about 30 hours so far and I've only played 1 dlc and not even halfway thru the main quest. Now thats what I call value. I've got no beef with Bethesda whatsoever.
---
You do know there’s a repeatable score (exp 10000) right? Just grind that.
---
Yeah a lot of the plans are labeled poorly. That plan is just neon letters.
---
The same way stores determine value of items for other people...
---
That peanut butter is gonna be $2.49 no matter how much YOU think it should be. Its the same thing here.
---
fox\*
---
They are all shitty opinions, I just happened to see an OAN post before.
---
I bought an XBox One when FO76 launched. The XBox was on deep sale cause it came with FO76.  Still have the XBox and love FO76.
---
Oh so you pointed out something you didn't like and requested a change in the sub that best fit your category.  It's just verbage.  You categorize your own wishes as suggestions and others as complaints.  Ergo hypocrite...your brain is making you feel smart but look stupid.
---
I’m confused by this post. Signs and letters is the Neon letter plan
---
I knew about seasons I didnt know it was gonna nerf the daily and weekly atoms.
---
I’m going to cry. W/e all I wanted to do was put 21:6 on my water purifiers
---
I have inspirational to help out with score
---
There are still people who don't even realize what this is all about yet? lol, this is literally the standard game design in the video game industry now, especially AAA.  More and more games are designed with a grind to make you miserable/exhausted so you will feel psychologically pressured towards just buying microtransactions (even though you already paid for the game and there's no excuse for MTX outside of free to play)
---
Microtransactions existing in a game basically automatically compromise the game's entire design because the company is incentivized to make the game WORSE and less enjoyable to play so you will feel the need to spend extra money to make it more enjoyable.
---
Bethesda went with this new "seasons" system because zenimax investors were getting upset that fo76 players were doing challenges/saving up tons of atoms at an okay pace and not being pressured enough into buying atoms, so bethesda stripped away our ability to do in game challenges directly for atoms and now only allows us a tiny FRACTION of the atoms we used to be able to earn before, in this new season system which just throws random rewards at you 90% of which you don't care for whereas before you could do challenges and earn atoms and pick out your own rewards from the atom shop.
---
TLDR: The new seasons system is about nothing other than zenimax/bethesda severely slashing the number of atoms you can earn in the game (and removed our atom challenges and tied atoms to the season tree in a heavily reduced quantity in comparison to how many atoms you could earn in the same time before) so you will feel pressured to buy atoms.
---
We've probably all seen the claims people are getting S.C.O.R.E. from public events but I have not, nor has any of my 7 friends who play more diligently than I. I also have not seen any proof of this. At this point I'm chalking it up to people confusing the SBQ event with getting other challenges done like kill 10 scorched, 5 legendary, 1 level up, etc. and not realizing it or some latency in the S.C.O.R.E. being awarded for them.
---
But I can hope. If you ARE getting it from events, I'm incredibly happy for you and also jealous at the same time. Maybe a video so I can rest easy knowing my misery doesn't have to be yours.
---
\-Sincerely,
---
Dude with no FO1st, money to burn, and a family to take care of, i.e. no time to play daily
---
"strain on the server" lol I can't believe people still believe that excuse.
---
I guess they changed the name of the plans I was looking for to “small letters”
---
Because they're bullion items, even though now they drop as regular nades in containers, makes no sense, chalk it up as another dumb decision.
---
Ayyyyyyyy someone gets it!!!
---
Exactly what I do every time. Let the idiot masses waste their ammo and complain later while you get a win-win.
---
Wasn’t the old challenge like this to kill 1 of each robot?  Mine completed when I killed my first assaultron, but I had varying numbers of the other 4 I was after already.
---
It replaces them with score to unlock rewards directly, including atoms. They’ve been talking about this for months and it explains it on the main screen.
---
I feel bad for Austin studio because they clearly shouldn't have been the studio that was put in charge of this game. They're new to Bethesda to begin with and, from what I understand, were making mobile games and struggling before Zenimax bought them, so they're also not at all used to working with these kind of games. This is completely new territory for them, yet it's them and not Zenimax specifically that has to face our anger when stuff gets screwed up all the time.
---
I hate the convertor, its return is minimal. At least, vending machines will still be useful for finding ammo. 
---
PS. Dont scrap those shells. Myself and fellow Shotgun builds will be thankful when we find them in your vend.
---
Well neon letters does include numbers as symbols so you still can
---
I got atoms last night just by playing
---
Turns out that data miners were wrong
---
Already did and I kinda like the way it looks
---
Gonna miss those Atoms but I'll be incredibly picky on my purchases now. You better believe it. At least now I can earn Scrip and Gold Bullion to get ***FUNCTIONAL*** things.
---
It should look like a Legendary Script Machine
---
I'm confused, did the guy keep getting junk out of his stash and dying with it? Surely you'd just get alot of caps.
---
I like mine :(
---
And to beat the craft or scrap clothing/ammo/weapons just craft and scrap 13 shirts and slacks
---
These people are called jerks.  They are common in online games.  As others have said, the only way to totally avoid jerks is to play solo on a private session.
---
Do you know how many atoms it will give me?
---
You get alot of SCORE from just killing stuff and doing quests, 10k experience fills really fast.
---
There’s a repeatable score quest that gives 100 score, just grind that.
---
Oan doesn’t even pretend to report the news lol
---
It’s easier for me to see the comparison just because I’ve been playing video games before we even had internet. I understand you have to change with the trends and times to remain relevant/competitive but they have a loyal fan base that loves the originals just the way they were . I’m trying to adapt to the new norm but it just comes off as greedy. Idk maybe its me 🤷‍♂️
---
I’d be fine with even 50% loss scrap from breaking down ammo.
---
i never joined nw today, logged in at 12 as dailies were resetting and it auto completed 3/7. no score added.
---
All the post I've been seeing the past couple days is really making me not want to give this game another shot :/
---
Looks like you were asking for a specific 50 cal and no one had that item. Maybe you’d get a better response of you loosened up your ask a bit. And maybe the market on PS is different from Xbox where I trade, but there you could score Legacies and or multi item packages with top roll items. Maybe Fate is telling you to hang onto it!
---
It's worth doing, it doesn't feel good that's for sure. I'm thinking of staying consistent and doing this every time it happens, if anything it might lead to them extending the season to allow people to make up for lost SCORE.
---
I actually need this plan. Where was the vendor?
---
Its very simple. If you think 1st is worth it as is, get it. If youre like me and have no intention of paying for a promise, and from devs that time and again keeps breaking promises, its really very simple. 
---
Stop
---
Giving
---
Them
---
Money
---
At this time, no. They said you would, so I’m guessing the weekly repeatable will alternate—XP this week, public events next week, etc. Or it’s a bug.
---
They never changed the name. Small letters is like a 500 cap plan
---
They act like store items
---
I \*ing wish. that's what a lot of people were expecting since day one. but I guess Bethesda knew better, that if we could host our own, local servers, nobody would be hostage of their stupid mmo/mobile grind and specially the atom shop.
---
Brotherhood vendor, inside the golf course resort with all the robot vendors, I guess it’s not always there so you’ll have to hop worlds
---
The score challenge is very tight where you'll only just make 100 if you do every daily and weekly challenge!
---
MakeAtlasGreatAgain
---
Ok yep I crafted a new set of the under armor and then I was able to mod it with the shielded lining. thanks for the tip!
---
Good advice 👍
---
yeah so weird
---
There is a repeatable challenge that gives 100 score each time you acquire 10000 exp, it’s quite easy to complete over and over again.
---
You used to be able to - it rendered it so you \*had\* to eat only canned food. Might be worth it to see if the same is true now - eat only canned food, but double buffs from all sources of cooked food.
---
1500 over 10 weeks, so it is less but a lot of cool rewards including ammo machine (people may be bashing it but it’s a nice addition, just needs some improvement).
---
You grow up. You could easily continue to keep scrolling but you have to chime in with “boy I wish you guys would stop complaining” rather than “boy I wish there were less things to complain about”
---
Armorer isnt working too
---
At least for me
---
I was getting score point at random times yesterday too. Pretty sure it was the 10,000 xp challenge.
---
I mean, it would be summer for Australia, so it wouldn't technically be wrong
---
Ive played for about 4hrs over the last 2 days, haven't been specifically aiming for XP beyond "go places/events where there's lots of enemies" and I've done that repeatable 11 times now. Ok I have INT 14, Egghead mutation, herd mentality and use strange in numbers to bring that up to ~21- 24
---
Maybe if you have INT 1, or you spend all your time picking flowers then you wont do it that often, but otherwise it seems rather easy to do.
---
What do you mean isn’t working? Why would you voluntarily pay for new content when they’re already giving it all for free??
---
Season passes and fallout 1st make it so we don’t have to pay for each DLC because they’re creating a stream of revenue for Bethesda to justify putting resources towards creating content for free.
---
Np np
---
Just join the groups.
---
Thank you! I'll pay more attention then
---
Could be, and I know that gun on Xbox is worth slightly more due to it not being duped as heavily there.
---
If it costs more than $ 10 to buy the rest of the way, forget that. I'm just going to have to let it go uncompleted.
---
Nothing of the sort. My point is that seasons seems to have a challenge structure where you can complete daily/weekly challenges pretty organically. Hence, playing normally should get you going just fine. You, on the other hand consider that a grind. Today I got 250 score points for collecting 3 purified water! That is playing, it is not some obscure repetitive grind. Also, you seem to think that you could afford the chicken coop or secret door with free atoms. That may have been the case, but I may have not been either. They could go up in the shop for 1200 atoms. That is a big grind for free atoms. Also, you are ignoring the fact that every 10 levels you are getting an extra 150 atoms within seasons. Anyway, this has been way too much time we are spending here. Instead of keeping this up, I propose we go and knock out some dailies.
---
“It’s”not “it`s” you smooth brain
---
There’s a challenge that gives 100 score each time you hit 10000 exp, just grind that and it’s fine.
---
there is a problem - once the ammo you've been selling have ended, the next option will be chosen. And you might not want that outcome!
---
God now we have math vs math
---
The reward based Season reminds me of MCC. Except on MCC you can progress by simply playing whatever and however you want to play. I'm relatively new so I still gotta finish Wastelanders so at least I have something to do.
---
There should be a selfie-stick mod a some small amount of bash damage.
---
Destiny's season rankings at least go up based on XP, not a separate arbitrary metric that you only gain on certain activities.
---
"Who cares that you're missing shots and wasting ammo?? You've got your handy dandy, trusty ammo converter now!!! See, we fix things!!" - Bethesda
---
That's insane but you're going to get that xp score by doing the level ups. And gaining that xp and leveling up is still the most time consuming thing in the game. If the early challenges are designed to take an hour that may be doable but you're still grinding your ass off doing something you wouldn't otherwise do.
---
They also said the later challenges are closer to or around 2 hours so, as you said, it almost seems like there has to be a cap around 2,000 score.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure one of my weekly challenges didn't give me my score either.
---
played yesterday a few hours, it was a total chill. no sweater, no hackers, mostly easy enemys. try it out: give it a try.
---
Unpopular opinion: the battle pass was free therefore they could do whatever they want with it in order to make you spend money. I agree, it is pretty shady but I'm sure it would have been easier to reach level 100 if the BP actually costs money. I mean look at modern warfare's BP.
---
eh. raider is still better for sneak builds. or builds that rely heavily on AP. hard to beat agi, really.
---
per is nice and the luck bonus can make or break critical builds.
---
I promise to Dm you if steel dawn is worth it!!
---
You didn't get the score from the events but from dailies that gave delayed rewards. No-one recorded has gotten score from events without having completed challenge recently or during.
---
Fellow Mountaineer here and I was excited too bc of the setting. However I only have satellite internet and not only does it take days to download updates, but the constant crashes and bugs and lack of ability to play because i live in rural WV sucks. Im currently sitting at around 3 or more days left to download the newest patch and if I can't get onto a stable server I'm canceling FO1st and PS+ and going back to offline only.
---
I didn't intend to sound like that
---
I don't get why people are so stressed about not completing all the dailies.
---
NW players need a way to earn more score too.
---
And on the flip side, OP could be content that other people, god forbid, might actually be happy with the subscription they have and let them be other than make a long ass post trying to start a revolution and tell people how to spend their own money. Swings both ways does it not?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Those are two very different game. One is a violent game of life, death and luck. The other is something you play with the babushka next door.
---
Awe man! I still have that one. Is that subject to being patched out too? By chance did you check the atomic shop and verify you have it "equipped"? I know that you have to have them check-marked as active to have them show up as usable in game. A short time ago I had to uninstall and reinstall my copy (PS4) to resolve a game breaking bug and in doing so it lost all of my preferences and had to re-equip stuff like that. Worth a look-see if you have not already checked.
---
Sorry haven’t logged in this week due to work it what are all these buffs? 
---
Well rested now 100%???
---
Why don't you just *tell* me the name of the movie you want to see
---
Every update is more sad
---
Amen
---
They specifically mentioned public events while omitting all other xp generating events though.. so I'm not so sure.
---
Quick question does the end boost you receive  increase your hp? I know it’s bugged on armor and does nothing , haven’t checked to see if they fixed it in recent update .
---
&gt; no hackers
---
I've noticed this too, oddly enough. I wonder if they did something about that mess.
---
You get them from lunchboxes, one of the SCORE rewards
---
Depends. I still prefer Casual for that sweet sweet INT boost = XP Boost.
---
Oh I had no idea.  I thought it was just a glitch that was fixed that prevented them from dropping before.  They are really underwhelming as an explosive
---
Seriously, vast majority of this community is always willing to help.  There are bad apples but they're few and far between in my experience.
---
Wait... really???
---
*I just checked*
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Take my upvote!
---
Public teams are mad fun but they might not hold up when every one gives up on the legendary run
---
Wish the copied RDR2 Online for once . Just make it experience gained in a season and not daily timeshare nonsense . Keep weeklies
---
That makes no sense at all. If you love it, go make a thread about how much you love it no one’s stopping you. You’re just whatabouting at this point.
---
yasss
---
I will never understand this argument. Why anyone would prefer to be required to pay for new content is beyond me
---
Thank You
---
this is designed for you to have to use atoms to get to level 100 in time. you literally have to  do every daily and weekly without fail or youll never make it
---
It is completely RNG related. Just extremely rare.
---
That’s still the same amount of clicks when you think about it. You’re just doing it before than after.
---
YAWN....
---
I don't like the look but it's not Ugly, it simply doesn't fit with the other workbenchs.There's no endless loop of you actually bothered to learn how it worked. 
---
So why don't you just scrap yours, followed by your Camp, and then your account? Problem solved.
---
Take my upvote. I was so angry about the UI making me hit back a dozen times before I even get the [Back to Main Menu] option. Really inconvenient if I have to quit in a hurry because some mob started attacking me. I almost fell prey to a radrat because of this...
---
Thanks for clarifying. Yes, I did seem to remember several times getting points for no apparent reason.  Just assumed I complete some kind of challenge I wasn’t aware of.
---
dumping all your atoms into the score system is very bad.  But yes, if the score requirements are that tight it is insane.
---
Were you in a team when you got the 1000k and had you possibly done 4 other events beforehand while in a team. There is a weekly that gives you 1k for doing 5 events in a team.
---
Totally agree, there's some much clutter popping up on the screen, totally spoils the immersion.
---
This is gonna get even wilder when they fix public events not giving SCORE.
---
the update was huge... so when I was having lag issues I hard reset and pulled the plug for 30 seconds. Plugged back in, restarted and was back to "near" normal.  Good Luck!
---
Exactly, and sometimes hitch + lag = Bad Time. Also doesnt Couple well with my ss Jet pack so yea
---
Possibly, I believe that is what happend
---
Can you explain?
---
All these Wasteland Mathematicians seem to be missing a few fingers!
---
So is there going to be weight lifting now?
---
They didnt even do what was done in new vegas either, they could have easily modelled it off of an existing mechanic in a well loved game
---
4 hours over 2 days. Done all weeklies and dailys except todays NW one. Havent done SBQ/encripid. Did RR once (failed). Mostly did events, in an event public group. Done the 10k repeatable 11 times. Currently rank 11, about to hit 12.
---
Could have done more if I was running an unyielding build, and focused on high XP events (SBQ etc)
---
So far the weeklies ammount to 7500 score, the dailys 3750 and the repeatable 1100. So atm its finishing the weeklies early that has provided the bulk of it.
---
Honestly, I'm just disappointed. Every time it seems like they are making progress and actually turning things around, they release updates like this that should never have made it past alpha testing in a normal game studio. As someone that has been playing almost every day for months, it just makes me sad to see them make so many missteps. I'd love to see this game thrive for years like ESO has, but if they keep taking four steps back with every step forward, we'll be lucky if they don't shut the game down next year. Sure, I've gotten my money's worth, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to see the game thrive in the future.
---
I think the same thing happened to me. I'm lvl 462 and the game is boring me.
---
Thing is, it’s all around crazy.
---
Either:
---
vault steel is supposed to be time gated, and it’s broke.  That’s crazy because it’s old content, and would take you 2 days to craft one piece, when you can craft one a day with max scrip (not counting dailies)
---
Or
---
It’s limited to 5 per server per person because....?  Why can’t the purveyor just sell it in a stack of 100?
---
Just another line item that proves the devs don’t actually play the game.  Either direction makes no sense.
---
I got 1k score for scorched earth and I no it wasn't a coincidence with exp cuz that only gives 100 score
---
I dont know if this was also a bug cuz it only happened the first
---
It's not that bad tbh. Sure it's a little slow but it isn't as awful as everyone says it is.
---
Most people were using it to trap people in an outnumbered fight, but the real issue is that in patching it they used shit coding logic and now pvpers can’t get into the fun 4v4 or 3v3 group fights we LIKE to be in. All they needed to do is set pacifist to make it so no damage is taken from players whatsoever regardless of grouping.  How fucking hard could that be. This taking away from the minority to give to the majority should ring a little louder on all these P.C. kids.
---
they implemented a anti cheat software, tho they disabled it a few weeks ago there are still little to no hackers anymore. i assume they fixed the erectus software alot of people had used or the anti cheat is still in - i saw a few cheater weeks ago, all low level - i'm guessing that are dumper accounts since they get banned after a few days using tools that injects or manipulates files inside RAM.
---
and also to add to challenges, perhaps there could just be incremental atom bonuses for killing say, 25 Lvl. 91 Albino Deathclaws you get 50 atoms, and that goes for like every variation if every creature? this game board is a nice grind but over the life of the game especially now its like ‘how many raiders did i kill, how many times did a deathclaw or a scorched zealot kill me, etc!)
---
I seem to die quicker than he has time to revive me. I see him spawn right after I die and just stand around like, sorry bro.
---
Don't events give score points every time you complete them? I don't think these maths are needed in the first place. You just grind them events and you're set
---
I am very surprised that at this point the base game is not free. Bethesda has Fallout 1st and the Atomic Shop as cash flow sources now.
---
I wonder how much more they would make with this model, vs an upfront cost.
---
Oooooooooohhhhh I’ve been doing dailies.. fuck me
---
Well said. Even the people who have the right numbers are ignoring the repeatable weekly. 10k XP is not hard to hit. If you’re running an Unyielding build, Egg Head, public team buffs, using XP and INT buffs &amp; perks it’s stupidly easy. 
---
One run through a half empty WestTek and I hit 10k. SBQ fight, Radiation Rumble, Encryptid, hit it twice at each one. 10k for 100 points looks insignificant on paper—it’s not.
---
Consoles maybe, but i certainly don't want crossplay with PC thanks.
---
I wonder if the game will get a new "end boss" as it gets older and new stuff are added. The SBQ can't be the big fight every time. Eventually she'd be relegated by more powerful end game bosses, like the dragons in WoW vanilla were.
---
What a stupid fucking outlook on this LOL. Most of the items are garbage to begin with, but almost all the content in this game is geared toward mtx. Everything they do is made with mtx in mind. There’s zero fun to be had once you reach endgame. Time gates on wastelanders items that they’ve never addressed. Pay to win fallout 1st content, and now this piece of shit battle pass that is in no way worth grinding literally any level for. This game try’s its absolute hardest to not be fun. I played the game every single day pre wastelanders and since then they’ve sucked the soul out for money in return. Nothing they add into this game has the player in mind. It’s all expertly crafted with the intention of raping your wallet and they know the fans know this. Worst fallout they’ve ever released and somehow they continue to make it worse as everything they add in says “yea this is free! But actually, it’s not lol give me your money”
---
The whole game is a cash grab, expect nothing less from Bethesda. This and eso is the only way they can make money since they take 10 years per game and their games get worse each time
---
&gt;I got from zero to level 6 in two and a half hours today. 
---
gtfo
---
Yeah man I did as well to start with, at least now you know.
---
Just follow the quests and you'll level fine
---
There are some places you can go to level faster but then where's the fun in that? Maybe if you wanna level an alt i'd understand. I'm currently levelling my 4th to 50+ and obviously wanna get it done quick as possible
---
Seriously, they dont realize that's is a free battle pass. If it costs money like modern warfare, then I would understand but everything is FREE
---
Completing the Vault is putting you from 1 to 2. So you could erase a character daily, if you have a free slot to get that daily challenge in mere minutes?
---
Right? I thought I must be missing something... surely the ammo would come out there after trading in my points. Nope. Just makes noise to distract you from how awful it is.
---
Just learned this myself haha! 😊 Happy crafting!
---
I doubt they will change it. I went through the same disappointment as everyone else but then I realized, the ammo converter isn't really for large amounts at a time. It's basically just meant to be an alternative to dropping ammo. It actually gives pretty decent point values for things like gamma rounds and 40mm grenades, something people drop anyway. Yeah it took me forever to get through my stack of .38 but at least in the future instead of dropping it I can convert it into points towards something useful, thereby eliminating the waste.
---
Same here, plus I've done Gather Building Supplies and still no points
---
I have it in my camp because it looks cool and is somewhat functional.
---
Better than mine, I join a team and am immediately dropped. So I make my own, someone joins and then just sits at the junkyard collecting scrap until they left party and made their own.
---
I just made a full set of Solar Armor thanks to you xD
---
Bond level in a public team. When it’s like that it means your maxing out the perk thingy
---
I have found leveling easier with following some of the Wastelander’s story lines.  I am a casual player and only play a bit here and there.  I was able to level up a couple times the other day.  I am currently level 76.
---
Have you experienced not being able to convert .38, or fuel? 
---
I did yesterday. Fuel, arrows, gamma, 40mm grenades, etc. it worked perfectly and I traded it for ammo I wanted. The menus are tedious, and it’s not clear how to exit the UI, but you can spam through because, thankfully, it keeps your place in the menu.
---
If your experience differs, please explain.
---
If you have the same experience, quit being dramatic.
---
Food spoils way to fast i only eat conserves now
---
I've seen a few people saying that events are supposed to give score, but aren't right now. All I can say is I've never seen Bethesda suggest events would give score-- but I could be wrong about that, so I'm not trying to make a bible out of it.
---
It's possible that there is a bug with events, and if that's the case and we do get score from them, then I'm sure the numbers will change.
---
It shows that you're bonded, it slowly levels up.
---
I don't think you will see one over your name but they will see it over yours.
---
No. Gauss weapons deal ballistic damage, so they’re good to go.
---
I was pleasantly surprised by the new Public Team system yesterday.  I thought it would be a bust but a lot of Public Events were actually being played and it was just a ton of fun.  We completed Scorched Earth numerous times, Encryptid, Project Paradise, and to some degree Radiation Rumble but that seemed to be the least popular so far.  This game definitely needed this system, I’m having quite a lot of fun.
---
Dope
---
Good for you. Get revenge on them!  I absolutely hate logging in and within 3 mins being taunted by some rando who is waaaaay higher level then me.  Does this happen a lot because it seems to happen to me frequently.  However I have had some really nice players give me goodies.  So it's balanced I suppose.
---
True man, at least they have a new thing added to the game most games updates are trash and not doing a single thing at least we get new things but hey have a good day man
---
contractor perk under intelligence^
---
I'd be surprised if they do. They usually just weather the storm until players give up talking about it.
---
It says it should but I have yet to get any score from any events.
---
The point is that fallout as a franchise doesn’t need or deserve a battle pass, nor anything time gated. Fallout 1st is massive pay to win. Battle passes belong in fucking free to play battle royales, even wastelanders endgame is timegated and they still haven’t addressed it. Nothing is created with players having fun in mind. Every single thing added to this game is monetized even if it’s free and the battle pass is a shining example. You have to now play this game 10 hours a day if you want to get to level 100. Orrrrr spend your money!! Yea that wasn’t intentional. Nor was everything else designed with greed in mind. This game is a bad fucking joke and somehow every “free” update it gets worse
---
Not to mention every online game is try'n to add battle passes so fuck us gamers if we play more than one game. But it's the best the gaming industry could think of to replace loot boxes cuz they NEED to feed off addiction somehow. Can never just legit make a good game.
---
This particular Wendigo is much tougher than the ones we can spawn in game currently.
---
Ineptness
---
I’m pretty sure we’re not supposed to get these special grenades as drops.  It makes no sense.
---
I completed that repeatable almost a dozen times last night in the span of a couple hours. It was super easy. I have an XP farming run I do that involves hitting a few specific places and then server hop and repeat.
---
Update sucks
---
I keep hearing how bad of a grind this is gonna be but I got to rank 10 in 2hrs so if that pace holds ture it will only take 20hrs of game play to get to 100
---
And I keep hearing how time consuming they are, this I definitely dont agree with
---
First daily: chew gum (3sec)
---
Second: kill 10 scorched (60secs)
---
And today first daily: collect 3 purified water (3secs)
---
The only time consuming daily or weekly for that matter are the leving up ones which you get by just playing the game
---
Were you playing at refreah time? 12pm EST?
---
help.bethesda.net 
---
From there select Fallout 76. Scroll down and there should be a submit a ticket button.
---
You seem to have a very set idea on what this game should be like for a person that is unclear about their average play time. You said you play between 1 and 10 hours a day. That is as broad as it gets. Then you seem to have the expectation that SP games and MP games require the same engagement. Fallout 76 is a game that is alive. Things in it come and go, unlike Minecraft and DS. All that being said, you can still knock most dailies in an hour and weeklies in 2-3 1 hour sessions if not in one. 
---
In any case, I believe you are entitled to your opinion, however I would urge you to avoid using what you think one's employment status is as part of your narrative. My time is just that, mine, and has nothing to do with your passive aggressive attempt to paint me as an unemployed game-holic with no life. I may never have 10 hours in a day to play, between my kid, my job and my other hobbies, but I still think it is nice to reward people who can and do.
---
(turns in 18x.38 each menu click, for 15 minutes)
---
yay...
---
Haha, that's pretty funny. :P
---
The thing is, there's faulty work going on. Take a look at the other thread and the math that was linked to by the OP... you will see that person isn't even using correct numbers from the game, as they claim you can only get 16,500 from dailies and weeklies per week, which is obviously wrong. They cite 6 weeklies when there are 7 (one of which gives 1500 score) + the repeatable, and they also cite bad numbers for the dailies... this is before even starting the math.
---
Yeah they're gonna have to tweak this, I'm not doing this every day
---
what repeatable challenge is it
---
I'm with you on that.  A content update with some meat to it is whole heartedly welcome.
---
Actually, funny story, I used to main the bow. I mained a bow in destiny 2 and I tried to do it in this game. This game's bow seems.. pretty weak, I even tried all the arrows, obviously with all the archer perks.
---
Oh, awesome!  I didn't see that!
---
Up until we found out how the ammo converter worked I had high hopes. Now who the hell knows.
---
I did it twice during Line in the Sand. Took ~20 minutes including logging in and getting back to camp to log off.
---
Just counted up all the items I have in my camp that fall into the "Lights" category in the build menu and anything else I consider a light.  33 total, not including the letters I tried to display.  Don't think I missed anything.
---
But, I did scrap a light and was then able to add another letter so it is an issue with how many lights I have.  I'm a dumbass for overlooking this. lol
---
Thank you for your reasonable, non-douchebag reply.
---
i dont know why you got downvoted, the only time bethesda will ever fix a problem they created is when enough people paying for fallout 1st start complaining
---
one of the CMs made a comment about it. they were commenting in another thread and someone said something like "why are you guys so quick to respond to meaningless posts like this when actual concerns like the ammo converter are ignored?" they said that it is not being ignored, that all of it is being noted and reported, but they do not have any updates at this time.
---
edit: [sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj64mr/i_just_walked_up_here/fwkp9gf/?context=3)
---
I really wonder if the SCORE for each level is increasing by 25 every level or if it’ll plateau somewhere like half way through. I also wonder if there will be a double score week at some point to help people catch up.
---
I was on a public team during Uranium Fever, my teammates killed the 3 legendaries instantly lol but I got to loot it once out of the three times despite not even trying to shoot the legendary any of the 3 times. It seems to be bugged somehow
---
Yeah I just completed two weeklies (build up CAMP and Destroy Robots). I thought I’d get 2,000 score points but nothing popped up? I’m confused.
---
Try them?
---
I though the dailys were only worth 250 each, so 6\*250 is 1500. and the weekly challenges were all listed as 1000 each, unless I'm mistaken. so that's 7000 per week not 7500.
---
That doesn't work unfortunately. You need to level up again, outside the Vault. So say, 5 mins max haha.
---
Honestly somewhere open and kinda close to a train station preferably flat
---
you got the SCORE at 3/5 instead because it is bugged and gives credit for completion at 3/5 along with a few of the other weeklies.
---
no it was definitely 1000, because it filled the entire bar
---
This is the exact reason why I deposit my junk before doing anything
---
I found the XP from quests so minimal in the game compared to previous games. I could do a couple of quests and then it was like I was no where near ready for the next one. I would then have to spend hours just to get to a decent level for the next quest. Took the fun out of the game for me. I'll maybe try it again and see how I get on. Thanks.
---
Sorry this post is so late. Materials that are in storage will be used first. You'll have a count in the upper right hand corner *where* the part info and mats list is, and it shows how many you have stored. Kind of like the workshop materials when you claim one, they get used first.
---
Definitely use as much of the stored components as you can, as they can be switched (variations only, ie wood walls to solid, doorway etc, not wood to concrete) and it'll lighten the load when you scrap what's left
---
*autocorrect mishap*
---
So Halloween &amp; Christmas events worked differently - Halloween was a running total, so 14k would get you everything. Christmas, OTOH, reset after every reward. So far, it seems to be running the same way right now. So after 1500 XP you'll get the Bats minigun paint, but it would take 2,501 XP to get the Wrapping Paper hunting rifle skin.
---
Sorry, I should have clarified. He had it all on him, but he kept trying to get it back. He had so much I was over encumbered for two of those engagements. I had to slip in my power armor to get more carry weight. Even with my T-60, dual calibrated shocks I was almost over encumbered in power armor.
---
First thing i did was get the shielded.
---
My shielded Brotherhood isnt bad an ill def hold onto it...but yup SS UA is my new default
---
Similar things happened to me, but it could have been a weekly completing that you didn't expect. I think one of them is complete 5 events or something.
---
60%.  Good with Salt 3 is still the best option if you need to preserve specific ingredients.
---
The pace doesn't hold though. The necessary amount of SCORE to rank up increases with each rank. Many have done the math already, and, assuming no change in rates, even if you do every single daily and weekly through the end of the season, you will still be short of rank 100.
---
The repeatable xp is the only supplement we have right now (despite Bethesda alleging public events would be too) and it is still a heavy grind including that, seeing as you only get 100 SCORE per 10k XP. SCORE from events is going to be a big factor in completing this board for the great majority of players
---
I logged in 20 minutes past the time, the countdown on the screenshot reflects that :(
---
I did login close to the time just before that but I didn't pay attention to the challenges. I only logged in for around 5 minutes then logged out again.
---
It's a good idea to, many people in this community are real nice, but there are some oddballs.
---
Line in the sand is good for XP too. Now that cranberry relish is buffed (some say it’s a bug) with the herbivore mutation the XP is even easier to get!
---
Ya, can't argue with that.
---
Don't have any and no one is selling :'(
---
Thanks 😊
---
Did they also break grim reapers sprint? It did not work for me today...
---
It’s in the challenges at the bottom of either daily or weekly (I forget) and for every 10,000 exp you acquire you receive 100 score each time. It’s a repeatable challenge.
---
You can buy last week for atoms earned in previous weeks then, just save them. It sux for new players for sure, but  i assume everyone who played before steam sitting on several thousands atoms
---
&gt; After chest I believe it goes to repair power armor.
---
I see, that will be a pain as well in terms of materials wasted – I will need to tackle that one strategically and use a more repair-friendly PA than my Excavator for a while.
---
The robot challenges bring back memories, I've finished them all a year or so ago. Cheesed the hell outta them by slaughtering liberators next to Vault 76 or clearing out Fuyinja base. Tip: conserve ammo by bashing them to death with the weapon (if you find a cheap legendary weapon with +40% bashing, use that), I never carried flamer fuel, missiles, or mini nukes to any of those fights. ;-)
---
LOL, the same old tired ass grind content that has existed in the game for 2 years is "fun and motivating." I really hope you're being sarcastic.
---
Also, the math, thus far, has been 100% correct.
---
I have the meta shit, but I would give it all away to play this game full loot pvp like in Rust/Dayz!!BETHESDA GIVE US FULL POP CUSTOMIZABLE STATIC SERVERS FOR RENT ALREADY!!!$$$
---
The only train station I can think of that not many people build at is Sunnytop station.
---
If you walk South South West slightly you can find a nice stone platform that is basically flat all over, really nice actually.
---
I love this update. Immediately bought it. Side note I think one of the items is 250 not 200
---
I would try selling those in a vend at half or third suggested price...power armor builds will eat them up. It will be ching.. ching all day long.Your character would be rolling in caps.
---
However, If you try to squeeze players for 75%- max price...they will probably just make their own and you probably can count on continuing with a huge collection.
---
I did it all but Three levels quest last night. Took me about three hours. I hate dailies but was happy about one bubblegum instead of five. Leveling is my least favorite grind of the game so I’m gonna dedicate a character I delete every ten levels to doing that challenge.
---
Do events, pick up everything and sell it to the vendor robots, sell drugs/extra weapons to robots. Make your camp a water farm and sell the water to robots.
---
Shit, you have a cabin? Here's me living in a tent city in a dried up lake bed
---
Man I feel this on a very real level. Used to live in Waverly, then Morgantown. Waverly Internet was garbo!  Hope it works for ya soon! Go 'Neers!
---
I'm surprised with all the "Vault residents" out there, the game hasn't evolved to where, lorewise, someone has discovered, say,a way to put sonic towers near the fissure site in strategic places to act like a Dragonrend, and drive her to land and stay there.
---
First time I’ve heard people use mics in a team in hundreds of hours , it was nice
---
You ready to die for your country you commie sonofabitch?!
---
My theory, is that being online close to refresh time causes this.
---
Someone posted who was definitely on at refresh time and was bugged, so I logged on after not being on anywhere near and mine were fine.
---
Absolutely
---
Tough to do when it gets removed.
---
Did it for you. Big guns.
---
It's definitely worth the bullion - the stat boosts plays right into my build.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Good to know. So you think I'm better to go through the Wastelanders and then maybe return to the main questline when I'm a higher level? Also is there a minimum level your character has to be to start the DLC questline?
---
&gt; nothing to show for it
---
You didnt get SCORE for the events?
---
EDIT: I guess they dont give SCORE, not sure if bug or something thats coming later
---
We are aware of this bug.
---
Agreed. It's not because of that. I just didnt want to ruin the fun of others because I'm so new.
---
There is also an oil seep here that not many people know of. So, added bonus. You can be pretty close to the station actually and have a massive open relatively flat area

---
 &gt; We are aware of this bug.
---
I mean new rewards. Like this garbage ammo convertor machine or clean sink which provides u with dirt water.
---
And public teams is very interesting thing.
---
Pistols aren’t bad, they’re just in a bad spot.
---
Most of the Pistol Perk Cards are in Agility which is also used for Sneak Perks and Adrenaline.
---
Most of the Pistol Perks aren’t really good.
---
And if compare them too Rifles... yeah no reason to use them.
---
If only 60%, but things I put in there last for days. I'd rather use my perk points for something else
---
Perhaps you finished a score challenge for killing legendary enemy.
---
yeah that's what I'm reading, it still sucks to be short on SCORE, and I really hope this doesn't happen again :(
---
Agreed.  Did project paradise for the first time in months.  We failed (distracted by a 3 star bug) but having the attention to public events is huge.
---
Oh finding teams is now possible which is huge.  We just followed each other around to each of the events and did work.
---
The ammo machine is total garbage but oh well.
---
gotcha, thanks, I was seemingly getting random SCORE here and there, so wasnt sure what it was coming from
---
Eh it's ezpz to spam the space bar on computer.  I converted over 5k worth of garbage ammo and got a good return.
---
Many thanks. Now I know which to focus on getting.
---
Not really. That's a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. They took away the ability to earn more atoms and choose what to do with them. It's not free if you lose freedom and what can be earned with that.
---
Who know.  Some people can't admit when they're wrong.
---
That doesn’t take into account XP that turns into score
---
As you lvl up/get more powerful you will probably have no problem getting caps. You just need to figure out what to sell to robot vendors and what players want to buy. Would explain it but that would be a very long comment
---
I'd call you delusional. They have done as little as they possibly can with this game from launch and have done nothing to change that view. Add in the this new reskin of the same old grind.. yeah.. no.. they are oblivious to what gamers desire. I don't think they even play their own game at this point.
---
I for one am shocked that people on the internet freaked out about something without knowing all the facts.
---
This right here. Beth even said they wanted people to earn SCORE organically in a manner that doesn’t detract from how you typically play....but as it currently stands, you need to grind continuously just to make it to the end. I understand not wanting to make it too easy, but this is ridiculous IMO, especially since we cannot earn atoms like we used to.
---
You are 100% right. It is crazy. I’d like to see the game last a long time too.
---
I don't generally begrudge someone getting something wrong, it happens to all of us, but did you even look at the challenges in-game? Or are you passing on info seen elsewhere? Because it's plain as day that there 7 daily challenges with one worth 500 (for a total of 2000), and 7 weekly challenges with one of them worth 1500 (for a total of 7500). That was true yesterday and it's true today.
---
I just wrote a post to try to correct this situation, because it's sad on a really basic level when there are so many upvotes for bad numbers that could be double-checked in like 2m. :p
---
Iva had it on off days before. not just tuesdays, Never had it at roll over though when it was 11 est instead on noon est
---
Thank you! I will look into this.
---
I appreciate you!
---
My guy!
---
Yw, this was destroying my brain forever too lmaoooo
---
okay fox mulder. calm down
---
hm, I think they are supposed to, idk if its only certain weeks, or if its bugged or what
---
Allraighty, im currently lvl 19
---
Perk cards help a lot. You'll find much more caps in random loot around the world like in containers and enemies and such.
---
Yeah true
---
Neat. No VTU stuffs, tho?
---
This is priceless: I checked my ammo generator today and now it's generating .45 AND .556. Bethesda, you magnificent bastard.
---
ah ok thank you!
---
An Hour before the dailies reset. I played Free Range in an Event Group.. Again No Score..
---
Did about 20 dailies and never updated, stayed 4/5 on my SCORE....
---
At least the ammo machine made everyone happy...

 &gt; Thank you! I will look into this.
---
It depends on your playstyle but i absolutely love it. Saves me from multiple Yao Guai staggers...i can meet the SBQ in the air for melee attacks...however its very weird
---
Some events just tapping it launches me halfway to space, and some events im barely able to hop higher than a player with marsupial.
---
I love it though
---
well obviously its ez on pc, you could automate the game if you wanted to
---
Huh  ,the water thing sounds interesting. I'll try as well.
---
Also bugged on under armor. Does nothing
---
Math has entered the chat
---
When the bar is full u get more XP than usual
---
Both possibilities. Right now we're all kind of going with what seems most likely in terms of the curve, I think.
---
pick up errthang and sell errthang
---
They buy it from you and sell it for more to thirsty settlers!!
---
From the FAQ https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
After I get the sink and ammo converter I'm not gonna care.
---
*stutter
---
And no you can’t get the exclusive cosmetics outside of the season pass.
---
OP, I agree with you. There was a shareholder meeting at some point where a decision was made: “do we fix the game and get 10 new customers to spend $10, or ask 1 old customer to spend $100 instead?” 
---
Every change that has been made, coupled with the ongoing bugs, requested features on the back burner, and constant new mobile game monetization tactics, time gates, new currencies etc should demonstrate to everyone exactly where Bethesda’s priorities are. And yet players just love defending this bullshit or just dismiss complaints entirely.
---
Yes. You gotta reach milestones that are pretty far apart now in the battle pass and farm a lot of items you don't care for + get less atoms overall. 
---
I preferred getting atoms and buying what I actually wanted, personally.
---
Whats that?
---
Wait until you have Explore a lot and reached lvl50-60. There is almost certanly older posts explaining it in this sub
---
I just got it and it's not really that hard to figure out or use, you can just spam A through all the menus after you've selected something and it remembers where you were each time.
---
All they really need to do to remove the screen refresh that puts you back to the start menu and it would be perfectly fine.
---
The conversion rate can't be the same as trading for it or making it on your own or else it ruins those mechanics. This is a feature for extra ammo. The interface needs to be better, but that's really it.
---
Am I the only one that does not get wtf this is, why we need it and just wants to play the game for fun?
---
Whatever comes of this post, positive or negative, I just wanted to say thank you for doing the math and presenting in a non-biased method and format.
---
If there was some way to give you a medal for Critical Thinking I'd gladly do it.  Cheers man.
---
Okay
---
You’ll need nerd rage, sneak three, escape artist and unyielding armor with at least three AP refresh. A lot of people run dodgy but I don’t find it’s necessary being a stealth build. You’ll for sure want to max out serendipity though or you’ll die waaay easy. I’d also recommend a lever over a hunting rifle.
---
everything* soz auto correct
---
I hope it's a bug and they give score later, but I think the daily mission is what they ment. Each day so far (being only two so who knows) there has been a mission to complete events for score
---
Awesome explanation XD 
---
Sorry I edited my comment after your post.
---
Vote every election, and I never said don't post, it just gets tiring seeing people seemingly misplace thier maturity over something this trivial. Thou to be fair, it's never really warranted.
---
I mean, its definitely not the same. Thus far, the math has been put in question.
---
This community is one of the best gaming communities around. I'm lvl 111 and I joined a lvl 23's team as did some other high levels. They were able to fight the Scorchbeast Queen because of our teams level. It's fun helping Newbies
---
Hhaha no worries :)
---
Don’t worry about it; I had the same trouble because I missed the information that there even was a light cap! Glad I could help.
---
It's up to you, getting a full unyielding or bolstering set is pretty annoying unless you got in on some trades for mass duped items a while back, I do stealth sniper and i dont use bloodied, I also generally dont like using the same youtube/copy/paste build 99% of people use so I may be a bit biased. I function just fine without bloodied, allows me to invest in charisma and be more helpful to the team rather than just hogging all the xp for myself. I can still one shot most things, so aim for the legs or use a knife when trying to share the XP/legendaries, the only time its really noticeable difference in damage is on the queen, I cant shred her solo in 30 seconds, but i dont really care to anyways. If you play solo mostly, 
---
 and can get the armor set, maybe itd be worth doing bloodied for the DPS, but i find it a boring build dependent on getting a full set of duped armor pieces.
---
I personally like the Wastelander’s quest line better and it has more in depth stories.  I like the interaction with people instead of old messages left on computers.  
---
There are some quests that require a higher level than you currently are.  That may cause some issues.  It might be a bit of mixing the quest lines to boost your XP and levels.
---
You're not factoring in that the score requirement goes up by 25 for each rank. Once you get higher ranks it'll cost 3000+ score per rank. So the first ten levels aren't 10% of the way through the season. More like 4% of your total score requirement.
---
Some times you have to have a certain amount of points spent in said category (strength, agility, etc.) to be able to unlock a certain perk card. I found this out while leveling my alt when I went to get nerd rage and bloody mess. not only were they locked behind a level, but I also had to spend more points to get them to show up. Hope that helps!
---
I'm in a full romantic relationship with Daguerre and half the time when I talk to her she's like "oh, I didn't know we were having visitors..."
---
I BUILT this house, woman! You have your own Mothman bed and plenty to eat (ya okay, it's mostly corn...no, it's all corn.)
---
Glad to see this. I can finally get some events done now.
---
I have a really good solution: find a game that’s fun to play. Factorio for instance. You’ll sit down for a nice hour or two of it and come to two days later wondering where the fuck your oil went
---
Wrong. They are classified as energy weapons, even if the ammo is ballistic. I ran grounded &amp; it halved the damage of my mini-gun.
---
We rebuilding the Atlas in anticipation for BoS arrival without patch 22
---
Ive seen the same post with different numbers about 5 times.
---
No rare loot. Really want a legendary bear arm so I need to earn that plan.
---
Being optimistic isn't negative, being unable to see a flawed system because it's being criticised is.
---
Somebody did the maths and even if you did every daily &amp; weekly you still wouldn't reach 100.
---
You say people always find something new to complain about or you can't please everyone when they've added the new public teams which is a great addition and arguably the best addition since player vending, people aren't looking to complain but will when something is bad. 
---
I don't understand your comment saying Fallout 76 isn't being forced down my throat? I enjoy playing the game but I don't enjoy having to remember everyday I need to collect water or kill certain robots. It removes the fun for me. Yes it was never an issue before but there was never a need to complete every challenge, you could have a choice if you wanted to complete them all or just a few.
---
Here's the incorrect info on the [wiki page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack_(Wild_Appalachia\)#Modifications).  I wonder why the wiki has incorrect information on it.   Was it correct at some point?
---
Thanks! We'll take a look at this.
---
I'm a fan of just south of Watoga train station. There isn't a resource to mine but there is never a shortage of shoppers.
---
how to solve the season pass, double all score payouts or make it last 15 weeks
---
then ppl arnt strapped to the game unable to miss a day and not forced to do things like nw if they don't want to ...id much rather have a paid battle pass if this is what the free ones going to be 
---
Im sure this will all be solved in the future with 1st members getting double score and extra loot . good old Bethesda I knew there would never be all seasons free without a catch
---
I had 20-30 blackberry plants at my camp and had the perk card where if you pick one you get two, easy to get hundreds of caps. Also purified water. Don’t bother trying to sell junk to vendors, just sell weapons and armor to them. What platform are you on?
---
Is that 14,000 reward on the Christmas side an actual outfit or another dumb under armor like the survivors denim? I’m grinding these now so I’m debating how far I want to go lol
---
I wonder if its broken in NW as that's wayyyy more powerful to use there?
---
See here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gwtl13/new_datamined_message_from_elder_maxson/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Hmm i think they aren’t currently taking tickets due to the pandemic
---
Im pc :)
---
Still seems a bit much in terms of how much I have to play in order to achieve 100. I'd like to see something put in like warframe has with their season pass. Where you get "challenges" each day and week, but when you complete X amount for that week the previous ones you missed show up to complete. As of right now it's a a bit excessive the amount of time needed to play.
---
This should have been Bethesda’s focus from the start. They wanted multiplayer to be this solo experience with abunch of random players scattered throughout that you may run into. Player vending and public teams are good examples of how Bethesda can make this game what it should. We shouldn’t be forced into co-op, but you should have actual organized ways to meet others(outside some pvp’er attacking your workshop so they can kill you for free caps). Public events feel more alive, the public teams almost feel like mini factions, and campsites are slowly becoming social hubs rather than a small shack just meant for crafting and nothing else. Would love to see the game slowly expand where the game has a perfect chemistry between team play and solo questing!
---
Next week's 'Repeatable' challenge will probably be 'Complete a Public Event', this is likely what the FAQ is referring to. People claiming to get SCORE from Events are (likely) misreading SCORE they are earning from the XP repeatable, or dailies. 
---
Source from the files: "SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event" [CHAL:005C5E4A]"
---
There are only 2 of these 'Repeatable' challenges that I can see, the XP one and this one.
---
Same Crybabies On Reddit Every_time
---
the event is not available yet, it will be in next patch
---
Patch 22 it’s for Fall DLC &amp; Season 2
---
was probably me. :( lost out on 1k score.
---
its a FREE ammo converter. If you don't want to waste time converting excess ammo you have piling up in your stash, then hop around to player vendors and buy it.
---
Just because i can relate,
---
I got the game at launch and stopped playng at level 25, because quest markers just sopped working.
---
I came back for wild appalchia but stopped when fasnatch ended.
---
I only came back in quarantine and im kinda having fun (mainly because quest marckers work now)
---
Thanks for this post! Clarification is always needed when bethesda doesn’t come straight out with the facts on how doable something is or what drop rates are.
---
Don't mean to hijack, but I haven't seen anyone else mention it, did they break stealth? My stealth commando with full unyielding leather is going from caution to danger from enemies in other rooms, or visually separated, with stealth+escape artist perk cards. Feels like I'm gonna have to go back to Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
I get really tired of my friends loading in and even getting kills before I’ve finished loading in. Our group also frequently has the issue where we have to enter the power armor before the person who actually runs PA can even see it. 
---
- I have also been able to get the nuke tube to fire multiple rounds at a time when in a fight I’m just spamming and switching weapons. Tho I’ve never gotten more than 2
---
Nope, just Christmas and Halloween
---
Public Teams have been great. I opened up a Casual team and immediately a level 9 character joined up. I fast traveled and followed him around for about an hour, and we did some exploring and I did a lot of stimpack drops, so much fun.
---
I really wish I could get on servers like that. It seems most of everyone is just in a team for the XP "just in case" they decide to do an event rather than actively doing them and too many times I'm the only one that shows up to project paradise or rad rumble
---
It didn't I was only level 2 and most the way through 3. Nothing changed and my score didn't move at all until I did the next daily which bumped me to level 3. I told my buddy about it so he also went to test it with the same end result. I pay close attention to all the new changes and "fixes" to see if things actually work when implemented so I know what to expect.
---
Fo4 DLC had more content and infinitely less grinding. I'd rather pay up front for quality content rather than whatever approach they're using now, because it's clearly not working.
---
either that or they're not funneling enough money back into the game.
---
looks great ! well done.
---
As awesome as it would be to be able to get purified water from all sources, I really want a way to get boiled water in a less tedious way. Give me a hot water heater or something to that effect and I’m all in.
---
imagine if they just made it a copy of the raider machine that you have to feed ammo to for it to run, already half coded  just speed up the creation and make an ammo use system... oh wait you already did with points
---
What system are you on? I’ll be putting in a serious grind this weekend and will help you out
---
I had this problem. I'd saved level ups to get cards at the higher level, but the cards won't unlock until you apply the level ups.
---
Ps4 peasant over here:)
---
Does that on pc do, once I get my selection I just jam on the same button over and over till it's full. It's a boring and clunky  system, my biggest gripe is exiting the terminal. Seems like you got to get into the right selection first. Very lame and seems like as other folks have said, nobody adding that to the game tested it? I mean the first thing you notice is how much effort it takes. Assuming I generally know Bethesda a bit, they seem to want this to be an additional grind and not something you just drop all your unwanted ammo into, and convert with one click.
---
Ahh gotcha, the game stingy like that, also apparently events arent giving SCORE atm, not sure if its a bug, or if that will replace the earn xp repeatable, so looks like I fucked up in two ways lol
---
Just a simple, imaginary filter to boil the water water before it hits our taps would be good enough for me
---
There are times where I genuinely enjoy doing chores of getting materials like acid etc. Because I find there isn’t much of an endgame anyways so without it wouldn’t know what to do
---
I've only had it happen a couple of times.  If you're on pacifist you don't really have to worry unless they start tossing explosive bait or nuke mines at you.
---
Everyone wants everything handed to them.
---
Sometimes ya gotta pay for extra content no matter how free you want it to be.
---
I rather it be grindy af with almost no obtainable way of getting it. If ya gotta pay you gotta pay. If you don't want to pay then you don't really want it or never really tried to earn it
---
Yeah I got it once out of the 5 times I’ve done it, it’s deffo bugged.
---
It was known before the patch it was gonna be like this did you just fail to look? Almost Every reward in the season is essentially a waste of time lmao and depending on who you are it is a complete waste.
---
I leveled my alt over the weekend from 20 to 50. I just did the wastelands story line, some of Becketts storyline, and server hopped the behemoth that spawns near Solomons pond. Use canned meat stew, and make sure you are rested. also try to hit radiation rumble when it pops up and tag every enemy possible.
---
True it’s fun before I didn’t team just because I didn’t want my water taken
---
&gt;Immediately after I fast travel to the Pylons and drop in a Keycard, and we annihilate the Squatch.
---
I had put off doing the encryptid event for so long, mostly because I'm terrified of assultrons, but also because I never felt I had weapons powerful enough to take on the imposter sheepsquatch. I saw that event pop up last night and I thought, yeah I'm going to do it now, these guns should be sufficient. 
---
when I got there the turnout was crazy! there were so many players there we took care of it in no time! a lot of this update is bad but this new thing is pretty cool.
---
My first build (A Year ago) was a High Charisma High int Power armor character that was designed to aid the team -- but like, teaming never happened, I quit before survival mode came out out of bordem.
---
Then I made a Selfish Lone wanderer Melee build, and thats working fine and all, then this patch drops.
---
I switch back to my first character and suddenly, Herd Mentality, empath, having 9 Charisma to share out 3\* Perks is actually a GOOD thing.
---
I'm kinda Eh on the journey system but public teams is a win.
---
RIP Lone wanderer , Long Live Strange in Teams!
---
A fast way is selling bulked junk to the npc vendors  
---
Usually most players have wayyy more steel than they could possibly use, so use a  tinkerer workbench to make a ton of bulk steel and you can make 1600 caps daily by selling it to the npcs
---
It's all about the damage cards. My aim is complete trash and I win the majority of my fights unless I'm up against explosives.
---
Then they probably wouldn’t have specified ‘Public’ events instead of just ‘Events’.
---
There are more than 5 options in that challenge you don’t have to complete them all just complete 5. 
---
I received the score reward after completing just 2 or 3 of them for that challenge so you probably received it earlier on and just didn’t notice.
---
Does it count if you bulk your own aluminum and then scrap it?
---
Pro tip: A vampire heavy gun with a high fire rate is the best weapon for this event.
---
Okay. But if you miss a single day. That's 2000 score down the drain. That's 200,000 xp grind to recover. So even with the bonus 7000, you can maybe miss one day and be fine.
---
Plus, spending atoms? Really? Each rank is somewhere from 1/10th to 7.5% of all the atoms you could earn for 12 WEEKS.
---
Edit: Thank you for providing this information
---
Allraighty, thanks alot man!
---
Those aren’t required to be *Public* events, though. That’s an important distinction.
---
Except it's not a little bit of effort. It's about 1 hour a day every single day, just in the xp. And again, that is assuming you hit every single daily and weekly. If you miss ANY dailies or god forbid weeklies, you're looking at multiple hours a day just in farming XP.
---
I'm all for having rewards harder to get but there's no 'difficulty' here. It's nothing but a time sink reward for a very small subset of people that have the time. That's it. Which is shitty design.
---
Yea it's a shame they didn't lay this out for folks. In my experience companies don't really do this with most systems and rather let people figure it out for themselves... which would probably be fine for a game that isn't as contentious as this one. :p
---
When I see this I immediately leave the team
---
I really want you to be right. I *want* public events to grant actual SCORE. I just don't see it happening.
---
I don't know how you came to that conclusion, but as I said I am perfectly happy to do a 150 hour grind. Having to play 1-2 hours every single day without fail to (hopefully) make it to the end of the board before the season ends is something different entirely.
---
Does anyone know if that means there will be a double XP weekend next week to further entice the probable influx of new players?
---
I second that Main Menu needs a way to view challenges. When switching between Adventure and NW, it would be helpful to be able to check what I need to do in each mode.
---
That's a great point. If you have a link for the file source I'd say make a post about it now, but in any case we'll hopefully see what's what next week.
---
That’s cool, maybe buying some atoms will help though. Have you tried that? /s
---
This one is particularly annoying, I have 5 points tied up in Agility for that perk but don't really feel like changing it with the hope a hotfix will be coming soon.
---
interesting... I have been getting quite a few vampire weapons lately, I'll have to check if one of them is a heavy gun. Thanks for the tip!
---
Have you tried going for the badges in your lifetime task thing? I cant remember it's real name... you know the one with all the atoms, rewards, etc.
---
I know the science one got a lot more accessible with the wider drops of plasma grenades.
---
The train one is also easy as heck if I remember correctly.
---
That’s a bug when weapons have over 200 fire rate
---
No private teams work the same way. If you are close enough to your teammate when they kill an enemy you can loot it even if you didnt shoot it.
---
Dont have them add a slow degradation to camp objects.  They get attacked plenty, and dont need to wear out.  You know they woul           d need repair every other hour!
---
You can also increase Charisma (which affects the prices the robots will pay) through chems, etc.  At some point, recommend getting Hard Bargain perk cards to further increase your rates.
---
NW mode needs to have its own game board. Trying to force people into pvp mode is asinine. But imagine that, this is Beth
---
Let’s give them an opportunity to address this before panicking.
---
There's a damage threshold for queen loot?
---
It will be added at the end of the year, its the last thing on the road map
---
In NW, The SMGs don't benefit from cowboy but do benefit from modern renegade.
---
Semi-auto rifles benefit from ground pounder.
---
Explosives weapons benefit from lock and load.
---
People  claim shotguns benefit from long shot, tank killer and ground pounder.  I've never tested it or seen any datamined info on it though.
---
Must've been attempting five finger discounts at the Raider Vendorbots.
---
each one seems to have the consensus that you have to either do every challenge every day or do an extreme grind of xp/events
---
Very unfortunate. It is a serious issue and I have seen many fellow players on this subreddit dismiss the legitimate complaints and expectations people have, calling it whining. I feel that people have the right to expect that something they pay for works and that any bugs are clearly acknowledged and addressed.
---
Did someone carry the 1 ? For god sake carry the 1 !
---
There great just fuck ppl spam invites when I’m just trying to chill what happened to you won’t even notice the server is there
---
It would have to be the last one, in my particular case. All of my challenges were completed and rewarded as they should have been. There were no delays. I suppose I could have received a duplicate reward for an already completed challenge.
---
I don't think everyone should expect to conveniently get 100% completion on something like this, but I fully agree that a catch-up mechanic makes a lot of sense and respects the players' scheduling and time. In the end I suspect whales will still whale.
---
Sometimes you don’t even have to jump. You can fast travel to your camp and back. Pretty rare to get it to do that though.
---
lol this guy said getting 20.000xp at least every day is not hard to do
---
its not trivial. this was the big debut for their seasons by delivering a highly requested QOL item. Now we need a QOL fix for our QOL fix
---
Yass, nice one bud! That's quality.
---
I think these days they just appear out of a vape cloud and you're lucky if they have the Duct Tape with them.
---
And yeah.  this game sucks.  I cannot say why I still play it.  disappointed every time I turn it on.
---
And both are vs the correct spelling, math***s***.
---
I'm not panicked at all. I ran the numbers &amp; know what it takes, and basically if you play consistently every day, you'll finish the full Season, though it may take a little bit extra XP grind.
---
I also wouldn't mind if Public events granted something like 50 or 100 SCORE just to provide a little bit more of a buffer.
---
Trust me, not knowing what to do doesn't ruin anyone's fun. Knowing exactly what to do and then doing the opposite will. I'll take an army of newbies over 1 griefer.
---
Couple of questions. If other player attacks u while u r in "the pacifist mode" u wont get a lot of damage, right? But eventually u need to tag him back in order to start a fight. How much damage u can deal by attacking him back the first time? Is it necessary to turn "the pacifist mode" off?
---
Live together, Die alone, amigo.
---
That's not entirely true. Every Bethesda game from at least Oblivion onward has been a complete disaster if you drop nostalgia for it. Horrible voice acting with botched lines kept in, bugs far worse then the current state of 76, the graphics have never been up to par(I remember when I was a kid and saw oblivion i thought it looks disgusting graphically, it has nothing to do with it getting worse over time, they just never looked good), repetitive meaningless dungeons and areas, bland combat, bland overall gameplay. One of my favourite videos explain it something like, "your favourite game isnt good". Actually I remember the releases for fallout 3, NV, 4, obvlion and what not and the fans were quite split on the games, even to this day a lot of people don't agree on what ones are good.
---
wow its not a Pay to Win item so im not allowed to have my own opinion about it, no wonder this company gets away with releasing a half finished game.
---
&gt; This is a problem. Math is not interpretable, only its consequences are. So why is a post with bad math getting so many more upvotes? Maybe because people *want* to believe the worst? I don't know.
---
Yeah, this sub is infamous for misinformation and fearmongering lol. We've had multiple hoaxes that had absolutely no factual basis but still ended up spreading here
---
You gotbthe Score when the challenge hit 3/5, it's a known bug that Bathesda has acknowledged on their help pages. 
---
Supported by the fact you're on level 10. It wouldn't be easy to be that far on without those 1000 SCORE.
---
They are boring af chores by design, to incentivize players to just pay for the rewards in the Atomic store. 
---
Aside from that, the whole damn game is nothing but Skinner box repetitive shit, it’s built to be habit-forming, not fun.
---
That's only if they let you get purified water all the time from sinks and stuff, to balance it
---
That's good to hear :)
---
Yea it's a little frustrating. All the numbers here are verifiable, and I'm always open to correction.
---
I’ve noticed this too, any event at all is eaten alive in minutes or less
---
Well shit. I’m sure you’ll find someone to help you grind
---
They finally created a solid solution to the ammo and then they fucked it 😒
---
I'm convinced now that no one at Bethesda even plays this game.
---
So, essentially a bunch of Karens taking off their masks in stores ?
---
No one can accurately gauge the time it will take. You’re all arguing over something that has to many outside factors to get right. Just play the damn game.
---
Exactly, I actually managed to get to a 100 in RDO. My mistake for thinking it would use a similar system for FO76
---
Same issue here I’ve had three challenges that were all worth 1000 score apiece not give me any I made sure to check my score before I completed the challenge and when I complete the challenge I’m not prompted with any success message or score points figures Bethesda would release a New aspect to the game that’s broken when the game itself is already broken
---
"Hello, we've been trying to reach you about your cars extended warr..." 
---
Hang up.
---
If you dislike the event, just activate it and sit it out, no need to even enter the mine. Of course, this means you'll only get the treasury notes and the completion awards and exp, none of the ore or tokens. It's ok if you need to do something else for seven minutes anyway, like household chores, but otherwise I prefer to pick up the exp, mats and ammo from the mole miners.
---
“Like the game itself I like it but I don’t love it”
---
You just perfectly described how I feel about FO76. I couldn’t put it in words until now. Thank you.
---
You would think they would put the songs from these trailers on the in game radio. But the wastelands trailer song isn’t, probably different to get the song for the trailer versus in a game
---
There is still no *need* to do all those things everyday. It's still voluntary, unless your OCD tells you that you **cannot** let any opportunity to get stuff for a game pass you by. 
---
I'm sure there will **event**ually be events that dish out sick amounts of SCORE points. And if not, then ok. That's the way Bethesda has chosen to do their business. Fanboys and -girls will fork out money for atoms to complete it anyway.
---
Someone said earlier that "just because you bought an online game and play it casually doesn't make you entitled to every single aspect of that game." Some people disagree with that, but he/she was right.
---
This is especially annoying when the game is being laggy in craft menus, so this would help a ton.
---
Yeah, I see what your saying. I mostly play on a team with my friends and thats one of the things I considered. I don’t want to be a total bloodied build VATS sweat where the enemies in the room are gone before your buddy walks in the room :/
---
I already one shot lots of things but I always want it to be better, so I’m not sure yet.
---
How do I sell my account? Any reputable sites?
---
Been a while since an update but real life stuff got in the way.... So I can categorically state that even with a multiple hour break, a different server, and doing the silo run again solo launching the nuke and killing the queen, I did NOT get score again. So either purposefully or not, it appears to be limited to one a day. 
---
That kinda sucks, but it's what I expected.
---
So still (almost) worthless?
---
Thanks for the Destiny LFG flashback.
---
I remember seeing one that said "NO BIO BREAKS!"
---
I gave up that hope long ago. I've been playing since right after beta ended and I don't expect much anymore. Their customer support has also left me with a sour taste from almost all the interactions I've had with them. It would be nice to see them get out in front of the issues and communicate more with the player base but I'm not sure why they aren't. I can't tell if it's an issue with being understaffed or a decision from someone higher up the ladder to devote so little to customer support.
---
And it's gonna happen, you can bank on that.
---
I wouldn't worry about that. Most of us high level guys actually love helping out new players. And joining a public team wouldn't do that anyway. Even if you're not participating in the same events as your teammates, they're still getting the XP boost once you're all bonded.  You're won't be dragging anyone down. I promise!  If anyone gives you shit, fuck them. Leave that group and join another.
---
Sounds like you got your monies worth. And you are still here.
---
It’s not a balanced season if you need to login every single day for 10 weeks straight without missing a single day to not even be able to reach the maximum reward, if you could get the max reward while playing everyday then it’s at least more balanced but even playing every single day doesn’t get you everything and there’s many people that can’t play every day and dedicate all their time to just fallout 76. I wouldn’t call that balance, it’s close to being balanced if we got score from events, that’d be balanced
---
Yeah I thought about at least using the atoms you get from it, 10 sets of 150 so you can basically buy the last 10 ranks with what you get from it
---
But I think I'm going to stick to trying to burn through it normally so I still have atoms for the shop
---
Good to know mate, thanks for the update
---
76? It's a limited MMO. Of course it's going to be a grind/time sink. That is the core part of ANY MMO.    
---
I don't have tons of time myself. I prefer solo RPG games I can play whenever I wish without missing out on anything. 76 is still in some weird place with me. I see so many people with all the mutations, CRAZY weapons, most in PA with skins, etc.    
---
As far as Seasons goes, I think you have to earn the same amount of SCORE per level but you are limited in how fast and how much you can earn.    
---
I was free yesterday and got 2 ranks in an hour. Over the next 4 hours later, I was doing other things and got 4 more with 3 being back to back and wasn't tracking all the ones that net SCORE points. I don't have the Wood Armor plans but I did get a drop but haven't applies the skin yet. I quite shortly after that.    
---
For me, the Perk Card packs are what has my attention. I haven't finished Wastelanders so IDK how Bullion works now how to use it effectively. I've heard it too is a grind but nets some of the best gear.    
---
I've only used PA in my first char in the BETA and he was so F'd in perks and gear I deleted it. I know Seasons is an overhaul of those quests but they should've added a lot of new ones. Once you get these, repeating Daily's and Weekly's becomes a tired, boring event.    
---
Again, even with a player limit this is an MMO at its core. They are designed to keep people playing as a game that doesn't end like usual is better for the company than for us.
---
If you're playing on Steam and you're using a controller, you can set up a keybind for "Hold To Repeat (Turbo)". I use Chorded Press "Left Pad Touch" + Button A and it'll rapidly spam the A button. Good for crafting and zooming through terminal entries like for the Ammo Converter.
---
I'm guessing the component(s) you need are the various stable flux?
---
If you can find them for sale, the lowest I've seen (PS4, anyway) is about 100 caps per.
---
If you have most of the mats to make flux, then your alternative is to launch your own nuke.
---
  Whether you launch you own or take advantage of someone elses, make sure you have green thumb equipped.  This will give you 2x raw flux.  When you craft stable flux, equip both chemist and superduper for a chance at getting 2x stable.
---
If you don't get to stabilize all the flux, don't worry - if the flux goes inert, it'll still be an aid item - you can drink it (and it weighs less than purified water.)
---
And in the process of taking out the critters to get the other components, you likely acquired a fair number of radaway and radx....dilute them.
---
In a way, you don't absolutely need the arch at your camp. if you have access to it, you can always hit one of the several decontamination arches inside Whitesprings Bunker, at least one of the nuka cola variants reduces rads, as does brahmin milk.
---
It doesn't necessarily have to do with having your own opinion. It's the fact they they're implementing free content to try to take a step in the right direction, and making one of the cool rewards unlocked at an early level, and it's being called a distraction from the score grind? I agree with you, the game has tons of flaws, and I've never defended Bethesda on having a game littered with issues, but if I get something for free, that wasn't there before, I don't see reason to complain about its conversion rate when I don't even have to use it if I don't want.
---
To clarify it is only when purchasing that it is listed that way. Thanks!
---
Still no where enough content finished practically all my weekly and my daily challenges already in just an hour or so. It really blows my mind that this shit gets playtested and actually released like the ammo converter 15 at a time whos brilliant idea was that nonsense
---
I understand where you’re coming from it makes sense, but I’ve seen other games that do this where you have to log in every singe day to get some of the best stuff as well. Again yah I understand where you’re coming from though.
---
Lyrics sound like Bethesda is now counter trolling the whiners on the forums after each update.
---
I have six weapons and it makes ammo for none of them! There is no 40mm, .50 Ball or Crossbow Bolts. For the effort to acquire the ammo converter, I feel it should also offer Ultracite ammo, even if it was at a very slow rate. I require Ultracite .308, .45 and 5.56 for my other weapons.
---
Then why do you keep playing a game that is designed to be a chore? Play something fun instead.
---
I have completed the whole set of tasks and every time i got scored. It works very well in my case.
---
They are giving this one the same treatment as VATS, they are sticking their heads in the sand and giving us other stuff to complain about like the ammo converter.
---
Joined up with a group randomly for Rad Rumble this morning.  There was at least one other group there as well.  Half of each team was players level 25 and under.  The rest of us were 150 and up.  Didn't really expect the low levels to contribute to begin with but every single person there was doing nothing but shoot ghouls. 
---
I was the only person to grab any ore and guess what, we finished with a rank of 1.
---
I play 3-4 hours a session. In that time, without trying or using buffs I'll level 1 or 2 times.  Depends on what I'm doing.
---
I think it’s the best assumption, but that would make me feel a lot better if it suddenly stopped at like 2k or something like that.
---
Exactly.
---
When I saw it had a terminal, my first thought was cool, I can tell it convert x # of ammo Y.
---
Just say goodbye to all my .38 that I stockpiled to drop at v76, then cash in for the 2cm I use at ludicrous speed.
---
Or even a box, put ammo in, scrap it...
---
But no.
---
I was deeply annoyed last night when I unlocked this, ran to my camp expecting to be hot shit in a champagne flute, but instead cold diarrhea in an old Dixie cup
---
Ah ok, thanks for the advice 👍
---
Lol I know gotta love those posts.  Not like other people have jobs, kids, families etc.  But hey play 5-6 hours and 20k XP is no prob!
---
Ha ha you're welcome. You seem to be the only person who was interested, so I though I'd let you know. I jsut got through killing the queen after like a 5 hour break, different server and the dailies even refreshing since last time, and nada. 
---
I can understand why, but holy crap, that "repeatable rewards" thing was definitely stressing the boundaries of truth so far as it's miniscule compared to what is required, and not really an event or anything, just pure mindless grind. 
---
I'm pretty much done for the weeklies now, so I gotta rely on dailies to progress even if  Ican get a 1000 bump from the queen once a day it's still a LOT of grind for people who can't play constantly.
---
I am not spending another dime on this game until they start fixing bugs instead of creating new ones. I have already purchased two copies of it.
---
I try to sell at the lowest price i can, most items under ammo are 1 cap, nukes, missiles, and similar dont go over 5. I dont like profiteering and i make enough to buy plans and recipes to keep me happy and busy
---
Oh my gosh thanks for the tip! Lol, so many missed legendaries
---
Ok I'll give it another bash and see how it goes.
---
Honestly. Did a couple of events, levelled up, 4 dailies and a two weeklies. Killed a behemoth over by Bogtown as well, that seemed to earn me some. The SCORE notification seemed a bit random though.
---
I’m getting points for completing events. I got 100 for path of enlightenment just now
---
Yeah, you have to do somewhere around 1500 damage in order to get loot from her corpse.
---
Here's what you do. Find a player vendor that sells serums for 300-350 caps. Sell those serums to a robot vendor for 500 caps. Profit. It's a way to guarantee maxing out those 1400 caps every day.
---
It most certainly is broken for me.  Easy to test and verify.
---
Back to lightfooted and mocking all the shitty trap camps that solely rely on punji boards!
---
Has anyone else randomly got the bat paint and some presents while playing NW since the update?
---
I feel that decisions like this are usually taken higher up, but the result is the same: distrust eventually builds up towards the company. I have been playibg for a few months, but I did notice that they have one of the worst communication with the player base I have ever seen seen, at least in my experience. Such a shame, I do like many aspects of the game and it could be glorious.
---
My extra ammo is going on the floor as normal, I can't be bothered to use the converter, I would prefer to farm lead it's more fun.
---
Ok no problem. I'm going to give it another try and see how I get on.
---
yes i think it is because it was in nuclear winter bundle pack or something similar and no one bought it. Couldnt tell there were emotes unless you looked at the details
---
Why did you link my post?
---
I tried it out after I got it yesterday, and thought its a waste; of both game space and player time!
---
I have over 4k .38 rounds, and I tried to convert them. I only got to 80 ammopoints before I couldnt trash anymore .38! Im like wtf is this bs!
---
My homie thought it was going to be a kick in the capstash, but after the community reviews and trying it out myself, ill stick with gathering/making what I need, and take over the munitions depot, while I build my raider rep to get the actual ammo machine plans! 
---
I can see it being good for new players under level 20, but after that its useless
---
Yeah, seemed to happen to more than one of the 0/5 weekly challenges. I got rewarded early on building up my camp as well.
---
Have you used it? If you think it's ok, you really have low expectations for ui and qol.
---
loot everything, scrap for materials you need. What you don't need, bulk and sell to the closest bot vendor.  Sell everything excess - aid items, weapons you don't want/need/use.  scrap burn magazines and books to cloth, bulk and sell (unless you are using it to make gunpowder).
---
In the FWIW category, until I got above L80 or so, I never had more than about 6000 caps.
---
But paying for a tier makes it a paid tier
---
I've submitted feedback that way, but that isn't treated as an open ticket, and has no papertrail on my end, the initial support ticket got auto locked by them!
---
Same i was doing my own thing and popper few challenges rewards, then i did 2 i wanted.
---
We also need to see if the increasing score cap keeps increasing forever or if it tops out at, say, 2500 or 5000
---
I already stated that I understand that some challenges are pretty easy, but there's much more to playing that game mode that turn me away. Here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj9cnt/some\_more\_score\_math\_for\_people\_who\_dont\_wanna/fwkw7qq/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj9cnt/some_more_score_math_for_people_who_dont_wanna/fwkw7qq/)
---
you tell me to calm down but you have a post almost identical to mine?
---
so what youre saying is that if we do the daily and weeklies we will still be very short and we have to do a repeatable xp challenge (almost) every day to make it
---
Jack Atlus would be proud
---
i think its a bethshit employee
---
It’s any addictions but scales the more you have
---
Before you do, try it out in VATs first! Oooooooft.
---
I’m with you. Easiest way to show your dislike for the lack of proper fixes is to hurt their financial model and stop spending the cash till they get it right. Enough of us do it. They will pay attention.
---
I wrote that completing the challenge once per day (10,000XP) doesn't seem hard to do (in context, assuming you're a person who's completing the challenges daily), and gives you 7000 score over the course of a ten week period. 
---
Are you being sly with this post? xD
---
Take this *W*
---
A lot of people are getting Halloween/Christmas rewards
---
Well I can’t get on much today so living vicariously through reddit lol
---
From what some people have posted they aren’t getting the 1000 from the Queen even, so I guess I’ll find out for myself what works for me later, if I get time.
---
how long has it taking you to get that far? I just completed my first match and only 100-ish xp. Getting 14000 feels like it would take forever
---
I’ve just decided to do as many as I can without pushing it, the only time it will be worth spending atoms is if the next level gives you back atoms, and this won’t be until near the end of the 100 days.
---
here are some tips for leveling up:
---
- inspirational perk (Charisma) gives you +5% XP per rank when on a team. it maxes out at level 3 (+15%).
---
- the rested/well-rested/kindred spirit/lovers embrace bonuses all come from sleeping in a bed and give you +5% xp. the amount of time it lasts depends on which bonus you get.
---
- food items like cranberry cobbler (+5%), canned meat stew (+5%) or cranberry relish (+10%). canned meat stew is especially accessible to lower level players, as it only comes from the "Feed the People" event in Morgantown. It is an easy solo as well. note that only one of these food bonuses can be active at a time.
---
- There is another event, "Path of Enlightenment," that gives an XP bonus (+5%) that lasts for 30 minutes, if completed. It is at the lighthouse near vault 76. also an easy solo. be sure to "commune" with the mothman afterwards at the base of the lighthouse to get the bonus.
---
- Intelligence directly affects XP gain. I saw in another thread earlier today that the bonus is about +2% per INT point. using food, chems, weapons, and armor that give you intelligence bonuses are essentially giving you an xp bonus as well.
---
- the public teams system that was added yesterday gives various kinds of bonuses depending on the label you give your public team. "Hunting" gives you +25% XP for legendary kills for each player you have on your team (up to 100%). "Events" gives +25% XP for completing events for each player you have on your team (up to 100%). "Building" gives you +1 intelligence for each player you have on your team (up to +4). note that being in a "building" group doesn't actually require you to build. 
---
ignoring intelligence and public team bonuses, you can stack up to +30-35% XP with the buffs above.
---
hope that helps.
---
Theres so many things being complained about this is only the most recent piece of trash that further proves Bethesda Devs do not play the game. 
---
But then again why else would you pay for Fo1st if the game was fairly balanced
---
That's true they did change the way atoms were given. That's pretty shady.
---
Enjoy that sunshine! My [C.A.M.P](https://C.A.M.P.ing). will mostly be filled with vampiric bloodbugs and glowing anglers this season, which is only slightly better than the Canadian mosquitos we get.
---
Mine is working fine, quiet as a mouse too. Have you tried clearing the cache since you updated?
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but did you include the NW challenges in your totals? I like NW and dont mind playing to maximize my score but just curious.
---
What’s wrong with ammo converter?
---
Or make the weapon worth using.
---
I've played for a couple of hours since the update and my Gauss shotgun hasn't got stuck - might of just been lucky, but considering how often it used to happen i'm confident in saying that it's fixed (at least for the shotgun anyway)
---
Yeah, the are a lot of awesome things about the game. I've managed over 3k hours so far even with all the bugs and frustration I still enjoy playing with some of the friends I've made. I would like to see them get ahead of their bad rep they've earned from most of the player base and be more communicative and proactive with issues. I've never seen a gaming company so hesitant to acknowledge problems in their game. I hope it will change but I'm not holding my breath. Either way nice chatting with you and happy hunting in the Wasteland.
---
Perhaps ‘panicked’ wasn’t the best word. ‘Concerned’ or ‘doubtful’ may have been more apt.
---
Your username might have thrown me off a bit... ;)
---
It could be a connection issue
---
Or it could be because Bethesda only adds half ass content and never fixes it’s current problems
---
You must be a mobile gamer
---
Well, "Seasons" wasn't tested in the PTS (hope they learn for the future).
---
I have more than 12K atoms - I wasn't buying much anyway &amp; the loss of weeklies / dailies doesn't hit me like it might some other players.
---
I expect, as a player, that we get a hotfix to take care of the glaring problems (SCORE not being awarded for Public Events, even though they said it would) &amp; of course Adrenaline not working anymore.
---
It begs the question as to why they don't respond to mass criticism like this. The only public complaint I ever see get addressed asap was the Fasnacht debacle.
---
I have used it, am currently. It works perfectly. The UI is cumbersome, but not impossible to navigate, and not enough of a pain to get on my soap box and complain. 
---
The ammo machine you get from the raiders for maxing out reputation (a lot harder to achieve than lvl 4 on Seasons) is also used to offset the cost of bullet production. 
---
The UI navigation is pretty straight forward. 
---
Want points? Go here
---
Want ammo? Go here
---
You can spam through menus because it holds your place on the selection. 
---
Is it funtastic and flawless? No. Does the spinning part of the bullet converter do anything? No. Does the converter let me get rid of 40mm, fuel, arrows, and .38? Yup
---
I heard maybe one guy had it working...(jk)
---
It seems so. However, it doesn’t seem to cost any caps to travel to one that you own. It will say ‘X caps’ but not deduct them, in my experience.
---
It is the will of Todd.
---
Some people also flat out refuse to do the NW challenges. No idea why. it isnt difficult. even if you hate the game mode, suck it up for a bit for the score
---
The amount of people running that build is like 1% of the community lol get your head out of your ass. The fact that this season pass is not aimed at casual players with full time jobs is the issue.
---
Update broke it. Equip something else with the points until it is fixed.  No word on when that will be though.
---
It's all very weird for sure, and the conjecture won't stop because there's no official information anywhere sadly, as well as this patch being riddled with the usual Bethesda-itis and introducing more bugs than it fixes. 
---
I do find it quite annoying that a lot of content got removed, and the content that's actually been added wasn't even on the PTS at all so had no real player testing- this is how we end up here. It's not even jsut the bugs and misconceptions, but the fact people learn and share stuff from it so we are informed even if not from an official capacity. 
---
In this case there's sadly nothing and it's a real shame because there's a lot I enjoy about this even with the limited actual content, but the lack of understanding and evident bugs is a constant thorn. 
---
I just hit rank 12 so I'm doing fine on the "grind" and have more time right now than the average player, but still.
---
The main issue is that it's underwhelming and disappointing considering how well other games do Session passes.
---
The rewards aren't great but even I would like to complete the season but, I don't want to move away from base building, legendary farming, playing with friends just to spend the day levelling or doing other brainless tasks for a level or 2 each day and then spend another day of the week doing weekly challenges.
---
I agree just because you own the game don't mean you get everything, but give people a chance... very few will bother completing every daily and that's coming from me who has played this game quite a considerable amount of time.
---
Why can't I miss a day of playing and catch up the next day by doing double I'd have done the previous day... things like that make it so hard to continue grinding... I would prefer the option of managing my own time and how I would like to grind.... The SCORE EXP should definitely be rewarded from more then just challenges.
---
but I had it.
---
It was my most used icon, since I help low-levels all the time.
---
And it's gone.
---
Would you mind sharing your xp farming run? I mostly just run around the bog but I’d love something more streamline if you’re willing to share
---
Thank you, likewise!
---
I like that they added this but I dislike that they took away that window that showed you the recourses at the workshops
---
Different discussion entirely.
---
just because someone works on a game, doesn't mean they have the power to change BS things.
---
Just curious, whats your weapon(s)of choice?
---
I don’t think we were supposed to have it and they fixed that.
---
LOL. I came here to see this comment.
---
&gt;  In the end I suspect whales will still whale.
---
I plan to "whale" a bit in august. I'll be gone for about 10 days for a vacation.
---
I would love this, but I doubt they ever will because they want to encourage people to play NW, even if it doesn't actually encourage people to play NW, lol
---
I'm loving the teams myself! Just join an open team, no more bugging players you don't know, no more players bugging you if your just wanting to house build, fast travel to all thier camps and survival tents for free, use charisma cards to give and receive extra perks.. all the extra xp and you never feel alone... what's not to love!
---
I completed 4 of the daily challenges and 3 of the weekly. I am past level 6 on the pass. I Can double check in a few. + I think I did a few of the exp ones.
---
Edit: I am ON level six [about 100 score in to it]
---
That’s a good point. It’s been so long since I read those I didn’t really notice until you said that.
---
Ohhh wow I see what you are saying now. I would not doubt in a million years they did this to make a quick buck
---
I was hoping this would also allow us to use Inspirational by ourselves... Sadly, this is not the case.
---
what do you mean.
---
Been using it for a year or more.
---
I ran through Whitespring last night with an Instigating shotgun and noticed it's still a coin toss on whether you hit or not in Vats. On a positive note I didn't have any of the health regen issues and was able to one shot almost every glowing ghoul when Vats did hit, which is a big improvement. That said as I was leaving I ran into several super mutants the I could not hit head shots on at all but scrolling to the torso and shooting worked. I haven't tested my auto rifles yet which were very problematic before the patch.
---
Edit: I was running 3 pieces of unyielding and 50% hp when clearing Whitespring.
---
Hes removed it!
---
Yea, there's not a lot of breathing room if you want 100% completion before the season ends. I can understand why a lot of folks have an issue with that, especially if the things they like are all near the end (which is the case for me). 
---
I had this same issue in Wildstar, where they implemented a daily login reward table. This kind of system is inherently RNG, because it's 'easy' for players whose favoured rewards are early on, and 'hard' for players whose favoured rewards are later, or who want everything.
---
As for the atoms, they don't give much, and I also understand why folks would be bothered by the lack of choice the new system offers. I just wanted to point out that if desired players can skip a big chunk of the grind (23,000 score) by purchasing the final 10 ranks, without having to spend money.
---
So, your rank is still 1/100?  And your ship hasn’t moved along the board?  And you’ve claimed or attempted to claim the board spaces?
---
Interesting. Are you sure it wasn’t just by chance or luck? Or is this really a thing? You on PS4? Did you blue screen?
---
Yep me too but I think you supposed to buy it, not just have it for free. Like Bethesda always do they fixed it immediately.....ish
---
Dude I never use those, I get a group of friends, wr get a party started(ps4 by the way) and we talk for hours and play fallout, most of the time just fooling around and nuking stuff, but yes the public teams are weird cause some rando could join you and actually take the game serious and that takes all the fun out of playing with friends, you know?
---
Woo just two more months til we get 5 more hours of content
---
Bro, it's ***exactly*** as bad as everyone is saying. Take it from someone who designs UI and UX for a living, this is some of the worst interface I've ever seen in a game. Hands down no question. No more excuses for these devs if THIS is what they're bringing to the table.
---
So, can you explain? I’m legit asking what the issue is. The only true ‘bug’ I’ve encountered with it is in the display of how to exit the converter, but logically I just held the button down and that’s how I figured it out.
---
I played a bit last night so I could gain a level and do the daily challenges. I really liked the teams! I didn’t think I would, but I really did enjoy it!
---
I'd like that. I have just moved my camp to a nice little lake and it bugs me that my sink, portapotty,  and water purifiers arent connected.
---
#FixTheAmmoConverter
---
Let's start spreading this everywhere.
---
I saw a fail recently but that was more because they nuked prime dead centre. Rookie mistake I think.
---
Exactly. These aren’t clever in the slightest. No creativity involved at all. 
---
I miss the days when there were interactive trap bases designed by skilled players. 
---
Now it’s just *‘lol, I went into build mode while you were at my vendor and dropped a blueprint, I’m a trapper!!’*
---
Very pretty
---
Ah the tried and true method of creating a problem and selling you the solution
---
Yeah. They want to wash it away. How come they don't have anything to say?! 
---
At least they should say they're going to change it!!
---
ey if you don't invest time in the game you will not earn all the rewards, it's plain simple
---
like i'm not gonna get the juicy skins in apex bc the last 2 days i was doing other things and i value certain things in my life more than those skins which i didn't invest the proper time doing all the missions and i'm not paying lootboxes to catch up.
---
They have not said if it's a actual bug or not,  untill then the anger is justified.
---
The only NW stuff I included would be the one daily challenge that involves that mode. I wasn't even aware that there were separate NW challenges, and just saw a post about it an hour ago. Once I see exactly what's up with that I'll update the post.
---
I suspect most players won't want to engage with NW-- or will just bush wookie it-- but it's still relevant information to have.
---
I love this update. Logged in and jumped right into events team. Killed three queens in an hour and a half. Radiation rumble and encrypted destroyed no problem. Made few new friends too. All in all level 10 score and 9 regular levels done a few hours! Can’t remember the last time I had so much fun in 76!
---
adrenaline being borked might be a good thing to shift focus on...
---
Ya this is pretty bad... It's lazy, introduces a bunch of glitches from what I saw playing a few hours last night, and it's a blatant cash grab. I like grinding even but I like grinding on my terms. I don't want to have to log in after work to go through menus and stale dialogs to get my daily gold, script, and now score. And if I play for 8 hrs a day on the weekend I want it to count towards the end game stuff and new content. It really feels like a mobile game now where you just click collect a few times a day and move on with your life cause there is nothing else to do. Really is a shame might be putting this game down for a while.
---
That's awesome, the camera angles and stuff they did made me realize, I would LOVE a replay editor in this game.
---
Pretty sure it’s for the new quest line coming at the end of the year.
---
he don't want score, he want to play casually or not at all and get 100 too
---
I’m glad it’s at least stated that there is a player base who will never launch that game mode no matter how many rewards they dangle in front of me. I mean us.
---
Cool. If you put skins or paints on things, those items won't even show as up as scrapable in the scrip machine. If your not wearing your armor on the outside and got some ugly paint for it.....one more way to safeguard.
---
How many other people are having this problem? I am already level 10 on the pass with only a few hours of grinding
---
Excactly this. It's a grind for the sake of grind.
---
Honestly that is the perfect comparison
---
New event is garbage. They added some kind of high rate of fire damage resistance to the thing, so prepare for your new Gauss miniguns and other high ROF weapons to tickle the colossus. Also, the random DOT spam and fear mechanic do not telegraph, so there's no real counterplay. Then there are issues with the cave closing randomly or becoming inaccessible when you die due to said non-telegraphed attacks, and the rewards for the fight are just as pointless as the SBQ rewards are for anyone who's been playing this game longer than five minutes. 
---
We've been telling them this since day one of the PTS, but I don't expect them to make any significant changes to the encounter. Coming from a game like Destiny, the encounter design in 76 is... well, it's bad. Real bad.
---
I mean it’s most likely a bug since they said public events are supposed to
---
I can see it now Peter Parker, jumps around hitting people with a camera lol
---
Can you provide a screenshot or link saying you receive SCORE from events?
---
Balance? Are we talking about the same game here?
---
They only defend it cause no one wants to admit they got screwed so players double down on defending it
---
I have gotten 2nd 5 times and 1st twice now. Shamefully, it's all by me being a bush wookie. It's taken me probably 6 hours so far.
---
It's already better than the queen because it has an actual fear mechanic
---
It’s weird. Doing the daily challenges have me points just fine. I did these two weekly challenges and nada, even though they’re checked off.
---
If public events start giving decent SCORE out as rewards, I'll cease any griping I have. My only complaint is really that I can't progress in a way that suits my on and off playstyle (I might play eight hours one day and then not play for days) and am forced into an hour or more a day even if I don't particularly want to log in or if life gets in the way needing to make it up with Atoms later.
---
purchased but does not show up to craft, other SS items do
---
Wow, that's some awesome tips there. Thanks for the help, appreciate it.
---
If it is supposed to be giving score for events outside of the dailies/weeklies that require events it’s not working for me and from what I can see in this thread it’s not working for many others either. I hope that it’s just a bug and not that bethesda actually expects us not to miss one daily or weekly (and when do nw dailies) to do the battle pass.
---
hide around the edges of the safe zone and in bushes. Most of the xp comes from time elapsed. You get around 200-300 just from that. If you manage to get into the top 10 you can get up to 700xp per match, over a thousand if you win. it's grindy, but not that much
---
Check OP above
---
I was really surprised to see NW challenges at all, since  most of the rewards from the Legendary Run have no benefit IN NW at all.
---
So are public events not going to give S.C.O.R.E?
---
As long bethesda doesn't confirm it's a bug im not buying it.
---
Dont know why you downvoted astral since that is the truth. Can you provide a link or screenshot that says you get SCORE from events?
---
Aren't we supposed to get SCORE from leveling and events as well?
---
probably his 3rd event in a group triggered
---
See: Antivirus software companies.
---
I actually stopped paying for first because why would I give them more of my money if they refuse to fix the game. I also have a problem helping people out who refuse to help themselves I have given them every chance to stop with their crap business model. I just feel sorry for all the dev's who have no say in what gets fixed and they are sinking with the ship.
---
From all those grindy events F76 had, this one is by far the most grindiest. No matter the exact points, we are talking 5+ hours every day... Thanks, I'll just pass.
---
Yeah your math is off. If it’s 34 hours to farm the xp then 11 weeks isn’t an hour a day. And at weekends don’t people play for 2 or 3 hours a day?  Do you want to just get the rewards and not bother working for them. See where you are 8 weeks in against the vast majority and if your right and nobody’s getting level 100 then moan. Not on day one with shoddy math
---
I actually haven’t. I was hoping to get as many as I could and then grind out the last few with the world badges, instead of having to grind out almost all of them in order to get the 13 total I’m looking for. (Armor/extra inventory) But it looks like that’s the route I’m going to have to go!
---
My PSN is Petunia_The_Pug, I like to kick scorchbeast ass as well
---
True, but isnt this literally THE job of a QA tester?
---
I got the ammo converter last night and i cant even use it. I tried to go on the terminal and it kept making my character look at the floor. At this point im just happy with the free sink, because that ammo converter is just more broken garbage!
---
No shit I can read thats why I asked you a question, Ive read the post and just triple checked again before making this comment. Again , where does bethesda claim you earn SCORE from events
---
And fix the ammo points 
---
And everything else complained about to no end 
---
You must be cool spending more on this but 60 up front plus 12 a month is  crazy 
---
For what we get out of it 
---
Then making atoms harder to get with out paying $ on top of that 
---
I’ll say it again 
---
CASH GRAB
---
I hope we can get some sort of compensation, maybe longer time to complete the season :(
---
Same thing happened to me at around 11 eastern on Xbox. I wonder if we were in the same event. I didn’t think to rejoin the server. Nice one
---
&gt; Its fucking SUMMER and they expect people to play every single day? Fuck that I'm going camping and enjoying the real world while the weather is nice.
---
i envy you, it's almost 100 days of quarantine here, locked down, winter, fk my life, if it wasn't for my parents i would be living under the bridge right now bc i can't do my work in hotels since they are closed and i'm broke.
---
Lever action all the way, love the way it feels
---
Outfit. It's a NW-themed recolor of an outfit that's already available in game.
---
Did you see the 2 links in my above post
---
or at least make it cross platform so the whole game dynamic doesn’t have to shift to too much
---
Which salute?
---
I have two (that are effectively the same) the first one was one that came with the bicentennial edition and another that came with the free states, both are still working just fine
---
Great to see this fixed. Really pleased I picked this up now. Thanks Devs!
---
I don't really mind it, I just think everyone's overreacting
---
&gt;You can also start a new toon just for the level ups. It significantly reduces the time to level up for those.
---
This. I keep one character slot open just for level up challenges. It takes 20 minutes at most to run through the first couple responders quests and earn 2 or 3 level ups.
---
It also works for NW challenges because you can easily gain a level just by hiding in a bush for 10 minutes while you browse reddit on your phone (like I'm doing now). Just remember to turn off team fill so you don't screw over people who actually want to play.
---
As of yesterday evening, day 1, I'm Rank 11. Extreme grind is bullshit
---
I have the following
---
Alcohol -1 agi -1 Chr
---
Daddy-o -1per -1 int
---
daytripper -1 lck -1 chr
---
mentats -1 chr
---
psycho -10 DR -1 str
---
I’m a casual player with a full time job and I was able to complete the weeklies and the dailies and the repeatable x3 last night solo - even tho my game took two hours off my play time because it was still downloading the update so //big shrug
---
5000 isn't very short, it's 2.5% of the total...
---
But that's beside the point. The repeatable challenge is to gain XP, you will gain XP as you complete the challenges. So my point is that you don't have to go out and separately do the grind to gain that extra 5000. It will come naturally as you complete the challenges. 
---
But if you want to speed it up so you get the run done before 10 weeks then you can try to do that by grinding more. How much time you save will depend on a lot of factors unique to each player.
---
Yea okay obviously you have nothing else to say but to read your trash post, even after I say I triple checked the links you posted
---
I'm level 400-something, I'll happily take any stray noobs on my team... as long as they don't spam me with trade requests. Y'all need the bonuses/loot more than my fellow high levels anyway!
---
I dont run bloodied but that look alright..
---
personally I run tank killer at only 1* and I also run 1* tenderizer on my full health rifleman and commando
---
so if you were of like mind to try it that would free up a point 
---
I also have adrenaline at 3* and gun fu at 2*
---
personally I wouldnt invest any points into sandman since its not working for you 100% of the time
---
im sure someone will come and tell me why my way is terrible for bloodied.. but what you have looks like a very solid start to my uneducated eye
---
&gt; People suggesting that you could do all the challenges and still be far behind are flat-out wrong, based on the information we currently have. 
---
If some people are suggesting that then by your numbers they might be technically wrong, but I feel like you are totally ignoring the spirit of what is being said. This maths requires you to log in *every single day* for over an hour for two and a half months without if you want to get a Chicken Coop and a Fireplace Secret Door. And grind some on top of that using the repeatable. 
---
For people who can only play on weekends, or people who like to play long stretched one day and then other games on other days, or just people who come home too tired on occasion from work to launch the game some evenings, for them it's not possible to reach the end of the Season 'naturally'.
---
People will perhaps claim you don't have to reach the end, or shouldn't expect to, but they are disingenuous. People were excited about this new addition to the game and really liked the looks of some of those late-season cosmetics, so of course they are pissed that it's been designed to be quite so intensive. It could have been half as many Ranks and it would still have been a significant journey.
---
Whichever addiction least negatively affect your build. As a rifleman, I chose ones that diminished strength, End, Luck &amp; charisma while keeping agility and perception...
---
I got that challenge less than 5 minutes into a match - loot 3 boxes - get three stims- take 3 stims - done. People are really pressed out here
---
&gt; The SCORE EXP should definitely be rewarded from more then just challenges.
---
I agree. Things like Scorched Earth, Project Paradise, Encryptid, etc. should have given a set amount of SCORE upon each completion. I have a feeling that Meat Week will. Would be cool if that was the repeatable challenge during the week of that event, the same way earning 10k XP is now.
---
Missed opportunities is a theme that reoccurs far too often with this game, but from my experience the only way to make change is to stop playing for a while. 
---
I bought the game in december on the year it launched. It was still a flaming mess, and I lost a lot of things to bugs and glitches. I stopped after casually playing for two months, and didn't pick it up again once before lockdown started.
---
Nicely done. 
---
I feel they've grossly overtuned the pace; you *should* be able to complete 100% of the challenges in ~90% of the time. Fallout isn't a hardcore grind-style game *or* audience, and I think they run the risk of losing their audience far more than they do reinvigorating spending habits. If people people feel the brass ring is *just* out of reach, they're more likely to shell out a few bucks to make it the rest of the way. If they feel the goal is unattainable without significant grind or investment they're more likely to just give up.
---
I (fortunately) have the benefit of everything I genuinely want being available within the first ~20 ranks, so I have sincere sympathy for anyone wanting items in the top 75+ ranks.
---
You could use a Bloodied pipe revolver which its damage dips into Rifleman if you mod a rifle stock onto it. So you'll effectively be getting 180% damage with all Gunslinger and Rifleman perks. 
---
Compared to a Bloodied lever action rifle it does a little bit less but still a very solid choice for a gunslinger.
---
Also the pipe revolver has a supressor attachment available so try to go stealth if you weren't already, Bloodied builds are glass cannons and can't take a lot of punishment unless you're in power armor.
---
Or not chang it. Lol. Tell us one way or another. 
---
Just ghosting everyone makes it worse Imo
---
If you are on ps4 ill give them to you for free, the flux I mean
---
Wow. You must be a troll
---
The grind is too much, especially if you don't play NW.
---
The loss of ~5500 potential Atoms is too much. I enjoyed logging in every day to do a few daily challenges for 20-30 Atoms, but this new system is a big turn-off for me.
---
Thanks for your input, I’ll try and get some chems and see if all the draw backs are worth it.
---
It isnt. Full public team with 4x multiplier for event xp will get you 20k xp in about 30-45 minutes depending on what events you're doing
---
 “play with team” was showing at the main menu when I loaded back in
---
Wish that quest came out with the update but nope lol. Talking about that bos quest in the roadmap
---
Who do you expect to pay for Fo1st if they make the game actually playable
---
Changing the way content is monetized has zero relation to quality.
---
Switching to ATS, as in Aim Then Shoot, will solve the issue lol
---
I did the repeatable last night 3 times - just playing how I normally do and I didn’t go out of my way to do so.. people are truly making a mountain out of a mole hill
---
I guess? I depends on your camp
---
This happened to me when the timer ran out and new dailies appeared. They appeared all completed until I logged out and logged back in. 
---
 I'm sure you tried that though...right?
---
Health &amp; Safety Regulations prohibit the carrying of ones. Think of your spine people
---
Do you expect lifelong entertainment from a game? That's pretty much impossible!
---
Yeah had that happen a few times on Xbox, was able to rejoin the same team. Had an issue one of the times though as the server was full after my game crashed so I had to join a different world.
---
THIS.
---
Are you on PC?
---
At least I dont need Shill Votes to make up for penis size :)
---
People are flat out refusing to do the NW challenges because "I dont play NW"
---
Then that's your fucking problem.
---
Same with the "I only play solo its not fair to have to do events on a team"
---
Suck it up Buttercup
---
I have the same but will swap med-x for psycho. Works well for melee, shotguns and heavy weapons because it leaves my STR intact. When you're not bloodied running unyielding and radicool, you need every strength point you can.
---
Hahaha fair point
---
Possibly, but when you have a lot of the same ammo type to sell, it takes you right back to the same menu entry needed, so for me, that alone made it quicker.
---
Your tolerance for low quality is too high!
---
People are reporting getting score from public events. We are supposed to get score from public events per the FAQ on the Bethesda website.
---
I played a couple hours last night and got over 20k.  Still I think it’s unacceptable the way it is, people should be able to do catchup of their dailies on the weekends or something.  Not everyone can play every night of the week.  I don’t even like to play every single night but feel like I have to now.  If it holds up that’s the case then I will move on and game bounce until Cyberpunk comes out.
---
I finally have a reason to run with the **Herd Mentality** mutation!
---
Are your eye's painted on? It's even underlined in red.
---
Heres a post a guy did where is says public events are supposed to award score. How much, idk.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjggda/from_the_seasons_faq_page_in_season_1_you_will/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I got stuck multiple times with my gauss shotgun last night after the update, at least twice. You may have just gotten lucky.
---
It added a small teaser. Go to your radio and then the Atlas Observatory.
---
Wait when I bought this game at beta, you could wreck peoples bases, and kill them anytime??? Gosh...who would have thought😂
---
Yea most people hate conveniences, as soon as some ‘glitch’ make people’s lives easier in the wasteland, someone would immediately report it so it can be removed.
---
Noticed this earlier, upon trying to travel to one however, after confirming the price, it said "you cannot travel to an unowned workshop". Not sure if this is the case with all of them, but it wouldn't actually let me travel to wade airport.
---
It's more than 3 spots too. There's 5 that I can think of. Also if you do find it and the scorchbeast doesn't show up I've found you have to find where it spawns as it bugs out if it gets aggro.
---
yeah but that 10% aren't some few crazy dudes living out there, they are like 800 millons, more than 3 times the states.
---
Edit: I was notified that my math was off because the 1st level is free. That should shuffle everything down so total amount score, without NW, should get you level 91. 
---
Once again that is if you can complete the other daily and weekly challenges for the whole season and not counting the 100 points for 10k xp.
---
I'm sorry i think i did not understand you. You play with your kids and your mom(grandmother to your kids)?
---
No. That’s not how it works lol. Choosing to pay for something doesn’t make it suddenly a premium paid tier if someone else can get the reward without paying. 
---
Anyway I’m done replying to this circular conversation.
---
That assumes you can sell the ammo, not all ammo sells and not everyone wants to bother with trading in person to make caps.
---
Having used it myself finally, I think it's okay. Definitely could've been simpler had they used the vendor menu, but as it is it's functional. You can spam past the text-scrolling of the terminal UI, so the wait isn't as long, and it's easier to hit the 2K cap if you're trading in "high quality" ammo or explosives. It's also cheaper to redeem expensive ammo that are traded in high capacities, like the 5mm.
---
I now have a reason to pick up the mini nukes in West Tek
---
The main problem I see here is that the next week-long event like Fasnacht or Meat Week, which usually cripple terminals, will definitely cripple this system.
---
Yeah and when we can then it’ll probably be far more balanced I agree
---
Yeah, yesterday I leveled up a 3, hit 4 and logged off. Today my main is like just 5% short, so I'll level him up while doing my dailies. Shouldn't be too hard to make sure one character levels each day.
---
I don’t know. I just know that the front line support cannot help you, but other groups may be able to.
---
I just focus on the first robot and then leave when the timer is down to one minute. You still get a bunch of ore and all the rewards.
---
The question is, si there an interest in ammo you don't need?
---
E.g., 10mm, .44, gamma, missiles, mini-nukes?
---
To me it says I cannot fast travel to a workshop I do not own, and it doesn't let me free travel to a workshop I do own anymore. It makes me pay caps for travelling and some other people seem to be having the same issue. Suppose it's a bug, and I hope it gets fixed.
---
I can confirm that I tried with a ton of them and it doesn’t actually let you fast travel to them . But why did they change the icon on them and get rid of the recourse window ?
---
AND the open sign... added value there lol
---
Plus with the implementation of the public teams - you don’t even have to interact with those people. Just join the teams - do your quests and leave the team! And I for one am glad they did put the challenges for score in NW because I do enjoy NW and so do a lot of people I know. I even know some people who play it exclusively
---
In the inventory, don't remember under which category, though.
---
It is because u reached 10k exp limit to get another 100 points of score. The best event ***to get 10k xp*** or more is the event "**Line in the Sand**" when it is bugged and all mobs every time appear at the same exact point. Throwing a granade with perk to expand damage area gives u an opportunity to have 2000 xp or so every wave and there are *A LOT OF THEM* during the event. If u r not alone *keep the perk of doing more explosive damage away* so other players can gain some exp as well. ***Plus u gotta go as a public team with intellegence buff*** bcz u will get more xp . If the event is not bugged u gotta go to 3 points where they spawn and do the same exact thing but it wont be so epic. I didnt calculate the exact number of xp by completing the event but I accidently leveled up 10 or more times doing them and other quests. It is a good tip to level up and even more effecient now. Another good method to got leveled up is doing **!!solo!!** "Project Paradaise". Every time I got **at least 5 legendary** mobs and lots of high level common mobs to deal with. Doesnt matter if u can complete the event or not. Just go to gain some exp, nuclear and acid waste. Hope everyone will use these methods.
---
p.s.: I leveled up 9 times during 5 hours session mostly bcz of this event. Nowadays I am kinda all about doing BoS stuff and the FD is my 2nd home:)
---
I usually camp by a body of water for this reason, so I can spam collect.
---
Oooh, that’s the “signs” part of that plan. Haha, it’s been so long since I’ve learned that plan, totally forgot that’s included
---
Thanks for the math, but that's still fucking horrible for anyone who has something besides FO76 to do with their life.
---
OMG yes.  Every time things like this happen it makes me realize more and more that no one there plays the game.  
---
Top left corner where all the other notifications go.
---
Only problem with that is I have no good legendary shotguns
---
There are some repair perk cards that make armor and PA pretty cheap to repair. White Knight is one, don't remember the other one. Under INT I think.
---
Yup.  I don't mind being the support guy with the cryolator and let everyone else get their shots in.
---
So, if you hit 'back' (tab on PC), it'll take you back to the last screen you were on.  I found it sped things up a little.
---
See you in the wastes o7
---
McBrainFungus 
---
You are so right
---
Yeah I have 12,000 + rounds of 38 cal and I thought oh good I can convert this to good ammo now ! (I carry that much because well at max perk it is 0 weight )  just like the other 0 weight ammo I carry
---
Not even gonna get into the 65,000 rnds of 5 MM I carry,Thought I was gonna use my other weapons more than I did (So built up my 5MM ammo,then got a Bloodied Explosive rifle of several kinds,and was a Sneak Bloodied Sniper a while ,then switched to a bloodied stealth Hvy Wpns ,it is hella fun ,and you can switch to the Gauss shotgun with just switch of cards )but right now using a bloodied flame thrower,Junkies Gauss shotgun as backup 
---
Yippee !
---
But at the rate it goes (20 rnds per  at a time, If I remember right ) if i could do them all , won't live long enough to do it and with a max of 2,000 ammo points you can store yeah thats not gonna work very well
---
The setting of 3 missiles per 20 pts is not quite as bad but still if I come back with 11 like I did ,I get 3X20 and either have to carry/store 2 or just drop them cause it won't take less than 3 
---
And 4 lbs of surplus explosives is a pain to carry as I am already using the ballistic ammo and energy weapon perks and do not really have space for the explosive ammo perk card
---
Argghh
---
Just need ability to input # of rnds to convert and just store as many points as you have,
---
 or better yet just drop rnds into it and it auto converts them to points, no terminal use at all would be better
---
I mean this entering the 20 or 3 rnds each time and max of 2,000 ammo points is just ,
---
ARGGHH 
---
What were they thinking
---
I mean I guess if you got it at low levels like 5 to 10 it might be ok but really ,the limitations at higher levels,(Quantities) are just ,what can I say about them ?
---
ARGGHH AGAIn
---
Sorry for the long post ,
---
About the ammo converter overnight and saw this post and yup the Ammo Converter As Is sucks to use
---
So it doesnt level up by doing anything..killing enemies, levelling up, public events ect?
---
the ammo converter is bethesda trolling people pure and simple. the idea that they had to use a terminal and have so much time to convert so little ammo just shows how much they do not care about the player.
---
Ah that sucks.
---
It's nothing like yours. mine was asking about the water wheel not some spooky mulder conspiracy theory. And the mods deleted it for some reason.
---
I've a feeling its possibly a bug, they updated the purveyor icon on the map, i would not be surprised at all if they accidentally broke the workshop icons somehow.
---
I don't recognize the concept of 'spirit of what is being said' here. When making an argument I think it's unreasonable to use misinformation to support a point that's really in service to another point. 
---
If folks want to criticize the system because it requires you to play daily to achieve 100% of the rewards, they should do that. Directly and without misinformation. I think a catch-up system would be great and respect players' time more, and that statement has inherent value without needing to be tacked onto a claim that it's impossible for players to achieve completion in the current state.
---
Wow calm down scully.
---
So far from my rather extensive testing today, the rewards from public events seems to be limited to 1 per day.
---
I have done testing in every "event" after initially getting 1000 points from doing a solo silo run and SBQ kill, but every other public event rewarded nothing after. I had a break for 5 hours, came back (after the dailies reset even) and then did another solo silo run and SBQ kill on a different server and got nothing. 
---
I believe this is by design sadly. My theory is you can get your extra 1000 score reward from a pub event daily but only once. The legendary run is the literal only "new" content in this patch so far, and they do not want people power grinding it out in a week, which is EXACTLY what would happen if you got repeatable points from events. 200-odd SBQ runs isn't THAT mental for someone who wants to do it. I'm personally still at a loose end right now and I would DEFINTELY go for as much as  I could get server hopping and doing 3 constantly all day. 
---
This is supposed to be long term "content" so it makes sense it would be limited in some way, justl ike everything else in this game is limited per day. It's still gonna be a HUGE and mostly unattainable grind for anyone even semi casual, but obviously that's the idea. 
---
"technically" make it possible to do the whole thing for free, but then make it massively unrealistic for people not willing to buy or use atoms to get there. It's a comon tactic so I don't know why anyone is surprised when they see the numbers involved to do it for free. It's MEANT to be a grind, and it's meant to be an incentive to spend money, whilst still allowing the truly dedicated no lifers to do it for free so there's no real rules broken. They can say you had chance, you just needed to try harder.
---
I've...never had that problem.  Is it platform specific?
---
Have fun crafting all those disease cures. I'll stick with my marine wetsuit, thanks. ;)
---
It'd feel a lot more "legendary" if they didn't give us the option of paying for it outright though.
---
I get what you're saying acorath. I am normally a completionist too, but for most games you can do it at your own pace. With the way seasons are structured, you're on their clock - you gotta be on every day cranking on something in order to progress efficiently. And the claim was it would be things that you normally do, but I never play NW, I'm not a huge fan of farming resources like wood just to satisfy a challenge since I already have more than enough and doing events in teams may not be some people's cup o' tea.
---
There isn't a simple solution, so it kinda is what it is. Good luck mate.
---
I think the early internet UI worked more consistently to be fair 😂
---
A fear mechanic?
---
I went through over 5000 in maybe 5 minutes
---
My question is are the NW challenges being included in your calculations cause honestly, I’m not doing them. It is no where near the stress and opposite of fun I’ve had to do them and I would consider it absolutely ridiculous if bethesda to expect those to be done to finish it. It’s a different game and some of us hate those types of games.
---
Okay but what does the water wheel not working have to do with the ammo converter?
---
Thank you. It's still too reliant on focusing very hard on doing the challenges everyday, every single one of them. Especially in the holiday season, this is not good. Red Dead Online for example, though being behind on every aspect, made their season passes fun, engaging, manageable with normal and casual gameplay and more than rewarding. This season grind here though is.. a marathon and feels more like work with a frustrating goal. 
---
Suggestion: A streak multiplier for s.c.o.r.e., even a small percentage, could easily satisfy both Bethesda's need for a profitable game as well reward engaged players.
---
I was able to complete one of the seasons in red dead online in a matter of days. I dont like the idea of having to log in every day and do every challenge to get close or done with the season over 3 months. Nor do I want to be able to be able to complete it in under a week like I did with RDO. 
---
They need a middle ground or increase the score points you receive as the season gets closer to the end. There are some days I cant get on because I have work or other responsibilities. But then there are other days I can be on all day. I think they should up the amount of score you get for grinding xp, so for those like me who most likely cant get on every day, we can still get a chance of completing the season.
---
That’s a shame
---
When you pay for anything, that thing becomes paid for. Even if you could get that thing for free, if you pay for it it becomes paid.
---
Yeh this kills it for me. Won't play until this is fixed. Cornerstone of most of my builds.
---
I was able to complete half of the dailies yesterday in 5 minutes... so far they've been easy, the type of thing you will likely do just by playing, and I have a hard time believing anyone will require more than 2 hours to complete the challenges each day. Experienced players will likely burn through them in 30-60 minutes.
---
I don't disagree that it seems like a grind though. I'll likely pass as well because I'm not a person who will reliably log in daily.
---
Hey, thats cool but I have one question? Is there a chance for crossplay pc game pass with Xbox game pass? Or nah?
---
True! This entire battlepass progression makes me focus on min maxing my playtime to be the most efficient in completing challenges and that has killed the game for me.
---
I'm straight up just going to stop playing.
---
Yes. My mom is in her 50s, I'm in my 30s, and my kids are 11 and 7. She's actually who got me into Fallout starting with 3.
---
Check out the Atlas Observatory that it mentions in the broadcast...
---
Nope it is set in stone when the Score Board pops up, even if you dropped an enemy on the ground and they die AFTER you’ve loaded through
---
I have joined several groups as level 20, with the others being 100+
---
Nobody has batted an eye lid. People have given me gear too through trade.
---
As long as you do something, people don't mind you being there. Often 2-3 groups are piling on the same event anyway, so you don't need to be that effective, just present.
---
What I dont understand is they said later levels will be closer to two hours. That was in their FAQ. 22000 score a day+
---
What are you talking about? You don’t have to do every daily at all? There are 10 weeks in the season, yesterday alone I got to rank 10 with 5-6 hours of playing and I wasn’t grinding challenges either. That means you only have to log in one or two days a WEEK and you’ll get to 100 on the 10th week but that’s only with one days worth of challenges and the weekly ones. If you do every daily and weekly you’ll be 100 long before the season ends but you don’t have to at all..
---
Its not just you it’s everyone Lmao
---
I literally end it "my math could be wrong or I forgot something"
---
it's pretty simple to see what the actual numbers are simply by opening the Daily/Weekly challenges. 16.5k SCORE a week is not correct, it's higher than that. but will still take roughly 10 weeks to complete. 
---
I don't know how anyone can "question" math when the numbers are right there and we all have cellphones with calculators on them.
---
That's pretty shit tbh. Farming materials is easy, just look up shit on YT or scrap the shit you have yourself.
---
Nice! Good call out
---
Well for starters it wasn't registering ammo conversion if I spammed through it. I would have to sit and wait for it to load each menu. Its just a lot more tedious and annoying then it should've been, especially considering you can only turn in 10-30 of each type of ammo at a time. If it was in larger quantities I would have no problems, but I spend 20 minutes using it an only got about 600 rounds of 556 ammo that I burn through in one event.
---
Yeah I tried that, still missing after relogging, and closing down the game entirely!
---
Right! I'll keep my shielded road leathers thanks!
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
I suspect the season is, among other things, a bandage for the lack of content. They're probably trying to keep folks around until the daily ops and expeditions are in, as well as the BoS story. 
---
I really hope next year brings a roadmap with some big new changes. Better endgame, mods, and persistent worlds would be a great start for me personally.
---
Oh, I like your streak idea too. It seems like a catch-up mechanic of some sort would make this system way more enjoyable.
---
Merry Christmas in July, y’all!
---
It’s in the OP dude... click the first link. Go to FAQ. 
---
&gt;	In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events.
---
go back to destiny if it's so good then and close the door behind or try apex oh wait right! you need to play the event daily to get the skins so you would end up creating post like here "why i need to play everyday reee", keep to destiny then.
---
Thanks!!
---
What if your team wins? Any or rewards?
---
No one is hostage, no one is forcing you to use the atom shop or to complete challenges. You are right that the game is not exactly what I had in mind when the original idea was made public, but what we have received, I am quite happy with. A fun game that is continuing to evolve and improve.
---
My goal is the gas mask and the gatling gun skin. Anything past that is gravy. I wouldn't mind the Jangles Beer Stein, but I'm not paying atoms for it.
---
I think that this is how it work now
---
Not really. You now get +100% EXP for grouping with random. So people are incentivised to group and follow each other to events.
---
They might get mob mentality and forget about person who may have triggered the event in the first place or wasn't fortunate enough to join the team before it filled.
---
Yes they need to let players who actually play the damn game a chance to test these things before they go live.
---
You're still trying to die on this hill?
---
You were wrong last time and you're still wrong. 
---
Explosive Bait has the ability to make scorchbeasts land. I know this because I've tested it and it works.
---
Since /u/maybe-some-thyme is saying their videos prove it doesn't work, I'll shared this video of it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJkRkewEkCU
---
Since there's evidence of it working, all the claims that it cannot work are patently false.
---
Bethesda said that they will add more ways to get score later, you can also get a lot of score from completing events as well, it’s possible without paying
---
Yeah pvp has been ruined
---
Someone posted this a few hours ago.  
---
It looks very cool.
---
I never said it was hard just that I hate doing it
---
Exactly. Level 275 here, never touched Fallout 1st never will until they fix the game, which they won’t. Sure it would be nice, but I can work just fine without it.
---
You can find the evidence I posted of it working here: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/casqo9/explosive_bait_gets_scorchbeasts_to_land_almost/
---
"**Team PVP:** we’ve adjusted the rules of team PVP for both private and Public Teams so that a team member who engages in PVP with an outside player no longer also flags their teammates for PVP.
---
* Instead, teammates must start PVP combat with the outside player individually to join the fight.
---
* This will help prevent players from being dragged into PVP combat that they didn’t initiate."
---
I wish I knew how y'all did it. I got nothin'.
---
The only thing I can think is that I am a "lone wanderer". Maybe you get more from teams.
---
But how many atoms you need to get there?
---
I was sort of hopeful even after the hate. Gave it a noble chance. Threw my ammo back on the ground and continued on. I'll dump some here and there but not going through and doing it all.
---
u/flavoredcancer seems to disagree
---
I’m so confused though wasn’t seasons in the public test server already? Were they not able to use the ammo converter yet? I don’t actually know but if they didn’t have access to it, why not? If they did why didn’t they say something..
---
This was me the other night, sadly just one day before these broken rewards came in haha. I was in teams that won NW 4 times!! One of those teams was so nice that they raced across the circle to revive me when I was dying from a fucking mirelurk, not even a player. I spam heart emotes when we win because I know I had very little to do with it lol.
---
one moar broadcider and the mole lady gets it! 🦾
---
Me either!
---
Paying monthly for a Bethesda game is not especially smart tbh. They proved with F76 that their quality assurance is lower than ever. One can hope they have learnt their lesson.
---
The Ammo converter was put in to distract us from BUGs in the game with SBQ, VATS, and the damage refund bug with shotguns (going on over a year now for that last one).
---
Stop buying atoms and they might get the hint and start fixing the bugs instead of just wanting to add shiny stuff in the atom shop.
---
It's a lottery. It's designed to only give anything good if you're attacked by a shark, struck by lightning, pick a 7 leaf clover, cure cancer, and bed the person of your dreams all simultaneously while skydiving.
---
How about a way to lock my camp so the whole thing doesn't disintegrate when my controller lags out and places it somewhere random so I have to build the whole thing again?
---
Really makes the effort I put into my camp feel disposable with no way to make its placement permanent.
---
Yeah, it definitely is what it is. I mostly comment on reddit in the hopes that next season will be more reasonable if people are loud enough. But given that the system is designed for people to fall short and make up for it with Atoms, I'm guessing Bethesda is hoping to see a jump in profits as we near the end.
---
I haven't decided yet if I'm going to bother with this first season. Part of me wants to only because it will be a nice trophy piece on the account, but all my friends have quit so I'm not sure I'll be able to stay motivated for 10 weeks straight.
---
&gt; but it doesn’t work.
---
it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJkRkewEkCU
---
So far I've seen one NW challenge per day, and I did include those in the calculations. So if it remains one per day, then ignoring them would require some kind of substitute (kill grind or the atoms you earned, also someone mentioned that next week's repeatable could be doing events instead of just getting XP, though I haven't confirmed that yet).
---
I also don't really care for NW and won't be doing those.
---
Alright
---
I logged on this morning and they were normal again. I'll have to see what happens when I get back on. 
---
Btw when I noticed the first time I had to pay, I logged out and back on to see if this fixed it. Since this was my private session, o still maintained my ownership and everything I built was still there but I still had to pay. (In fact, as you stated, if I didn't own it I wouldn't be able to FT there at all)
---
Just ran Radiation Rumble no difference between 1 rad shield and 4 rad shields.  I took the same amount if rads in my PA.
---
You cant attack a workshop when someone else starts attacking it.
---
Even if its your teammate! This is a bug.
---
I use the marine wetsuit and still get many diseases.
---
That's a FAQ with no evidence of players gaining said score exp. 
---
I have done around 30 public events since the start and not a single extra score has been awarded. 
---
Most people get confused by the 100xp for 10.000xp  challenge with that beeing the event rewards. 
---
The FAQ says it does, reality it does not. 
---
Bug or no bug, Bethesda needs to clarify this.
---
I've just run some numbers for more casual players:
---
Let's assume, instead of logging in, playing a few hours every day to do everything, you play once a week. In this time you play for four or five hours, completing all daily challenges (not including Nuclear Winter) and all weekly challenges. I think this is fair enough: I completed pretty much all of the weekly challenges yesterday (some by accident), and it's definitely within scope for high-level players to do all of them if they take the time to.
---
This will give you 7500 SCORE from the weeklies and 1750 SCORE from the dailies for a total of 9250 SCORE per week for casual, adventure-only play. I'd imagine most people would probably get the +100 SCORE a couple of times too, so we'll add 200 more SCORE on for a total of 9450 SCORE per week.
---
There's 10 weeks in the season. Let's say one of those weeks you don't play because you're on holiday, so nine weeks of playing once per week. You'll have a total of roughly 85000 SCORE. Because of the way the SCORE requirement ranks up, by my maths you'll end up at around level 52 on the board. If you reinvest the atoms earnt (150 atoms five times), you'll be at around level 57 by the end of the season.
---
Make of that what you will - for some people it might be very offensive, to others it might seem more than fair if you aren't progressing every day.
---
No no, Bethesda Support is the worst thing imagined, but that atrocity called the Ammo Converter is pretty damn close to beating Support out.
---
Ok.
---
Am I supposed to either care or know who that is?
---
I understand that they did this to stop public team griefing or whatever. 
---
But i see no reason for workshops to be broken
---
All I know is without free atoms I dont give a fuck and if I'm not combining free atoms with ones I bought to water down the 1 cent = 1 atom ratio, I guess I'm not buying anymore of them either.
---
that wasnt from you doing the event, that is from the game being coded like shit and you receiving the SCORE XP pop up late/delayed. WTF sense would it make for you to randomly get more SCORE mid event? FFS....
---
I was very surprised and confused but I took it in stride. 
---
Hey, of all the things they could have broken with update 20, this is a pretty good one lol.
---
Yeah but you get fewer of them because the wetsuit prevents all diseases from water.
---
Neat, still getting less than before
---
Again try in a nuke zone.  Thats, for lack of a better term, a different type of radiation.
---
Public Events don't reward S.C.O.R.E. Anyone that claims otherwise likely got Score from the complete event daily, complete events in group, or the XP challenges. Also the Bot one yesterday and gather building materials was rewarding Score at only 3/5 of the requirements being met so that was also throwing people off.
---
Hmm thanks, it’s been confusing, I didn’t notice anything popping up but with all the new stuff I could’ve easily missed it.
---
Didn't you read the patch notes? They added a feature where you specifically will only receive tire irons and grenade launchers from here on it.
---
Ammo collection should not be my prime concern at all times.
---
Yes workshops is PvP area, it shouldn't be like that
---
Right... which is why OP is saying it’s a bug that people aren’t getting it
---
You could try a combination of the ”come here/follow me” and the “Cooking” emote
---
I didn’t say whether or not it is a good amount, everybody has to judge for themselves. It was just a little heads up
---
I believe there is one
---
It's a big commitment if you want to 100% it, yea. The highest rank that interests me is 78, but I still doubt that I'll get there. This kind of ladder system is RNG like that, and it sucks.
---
I'd take that with a pinch of salt and see where you are by next Monday. Earlier levels are faster ranks and you'll have gotten more SCORE from weekly challenges.
---
Maybe if you read the comments you’ll find there are others who have also drawn the same conclusion that your claim is bogus
---
the whales will
---
I'm the person who did the actual functionality research on this topic, and no one was able to show it working consistently on the queen. It does have the ability to work on regular scorchbeasts, but like most parts of FO76, there's problems.
---
Yeah, weren't there one you could win from NW also? But i think it was automatic
---
you know the game is back ALIVE when you make two levels in a row during ONE scorched earth event. without noticing it... \*thumbsup\*
---
Here’s 10 minutes across 2 videos showing it doesn’t work
---
Okay now that I agree with. It is a pain to go through. I thought that, with my 2000 .38 going 18 at a time. I read some comment about someone with 20000 .38, that’s going to take forever.
---
I agree that they COULD’VE made the UI 1000% better, and easier to use. But to me, that’s not a bug. It still functions (for me) the way it states it would.
---
I have not had issues spamming through to sell off ammo yet, but I’ve only turned in around 8000 points worth of ammo.
---
If it’s taking your ammo and not rewarding points, that’s way different.
---
After the last patch I had lost mine T.T
---
With all the rads going around, I'd say they have a fair few *extra* fingers.
---
Don’t mind if i steal the crane sign with the welcome home sign! 🤯
---
My bad didn't mean to reply to you
---
My god, seeing it all laid out like that, this game has a LOT of forms of currency.
---
Future of this game is more costumes and monitatation. Trying to squeeze more money. At least make the rewards worth it.
---
Screw a guilie armor . You won't be using that end game.
---
Once again, OP is not bethesda, only bethesda knows if its a bug or not. 
---
For now the "earn xp by completing events" is considered a lie unless changed.
---
XP is earned through bounties for the most part which is an arbitrary set of tasks that force you to play in a certain way instead of focusing on actually winning.
---
If you show ten examples of it not working and I show one example of it working, does that prove it doesn't work?
---
Or does it show that it works poorly and has bugs, like most parts of FO76?
---
You got the points when the weeklies hit 3/5. It's a bug, they've acknowledged it and are looking into it.
---
There’s a note at the tent at ATLAS, and a radio signal, and not much else.
---
Sorry to hear that. :(
---
Must’ve missed that part, makes sense tho seems to be all i ever get
---
Every day you have about 7 dailies you can do each about 250-500 points.
---
Every week you have about 6 weeklies you can do each about 1000 points
---
There’s a repeatable weekly that for every 10K experience you earn (actually pretty easy to do a couple of times a day) for 100 points.
---
Man that still sucks. You have to play every single day, do every single daily, do every single weekly, and still do more just to complete the run?
---
Fuck that. What kind of no lifer plays a single game that much or has time to do this? 
---
This season pass is garbage and you trying to put it in a positive light has just done the opposite for me.
---
Some of the rewards on the map gives atoms
---
all yours haha 😁
---
Yeah, I don't worry when I do have to go into the water, but I'll still try out the SS Underarmor.
---
Got to level 9 in one day. Just hit level 10 can probably hit 12 or 13 today and 1blevel after that until the weekly resets.
---
IGN: hyperknightg Add me!
---
Not this time, but it has happened before. Sorry :/
---
Isn't that the plot of Sharknado?
---
That documentary shows it's possible.
---
Sure, people can disagree with me. That's their right.
---
Are you going to list all of them, one by one? Or is that person extra special to get a call out?
---
You can earn as much as you want if you keep earning xp, it’s like 100,000 xp for 100 points and it’s repeatable in the weekly tab
---
I find the ammo converter to only be good for the very specific way that I use it (trade missiles for plasma cells for my plasma caster). Beyond that, I can’t think of how it’d be useful.
---
I actually think that would be a fair situation, because almost 60% completion for one session a week is pretty rewarding. 
---
The only real problem is the ladder design means people whose favourites are early will love it, and those whose favourites are later will be penalized. A system like this needs to give us some jump tokens or something so we can snag at least a few things that are meaningful to us.
---
Well shit. I usually don’t login until the evening so fingers crossed I guess.
---
Thing is, you admit with your own math that there is still a shortfall that requires you to make up the missing SCORE with the repeatable (or Atoms). You haven't 'revealed' anything enlightening or hopeful, like it actually being possible to do in only six weeks of casual engagement. So it's not like they are even factually wrong either. Believe it or not but tens of thousands of XP is a lot of XP to some people. I personally play several days per week and gain a level maybe once or twice in that week. I can 'force it' by using my OP built characters, but my Main is a stealth pistoleer, who has to be very careful how they approach small packs of super mutants, and often the smarter way is to avoid conflict entirely if possible. You can see why that would make gaining XP fast on that particular character a problem. Now realise how many food builds are out there.
---
To address the last part about the amount you yield. It is a lvl 4 reward, I was not expecting it to replace any method of bullet farming. Instead, the converter + the ammo machine from raiders + lead farming, should keep you well stocked. I expected it to be just a buff to my own ammo creation.
---
I was hoping workshops would become pvp battlegrounds, with teams building them up and other teams trying to take them over. :/
---
Overall good looking build, couple of thoughts based on my own preferences:
---
- Assuming you run with Dense on your Chest armor. if not then a couple points in Fireproof helps a lot from getting blown up (also works agains SBQ sonic attack)
---
- Adrenaline is an interesting one... personally I run with 1 pt in it and allocate the other 4 elsewhere
---
- Gunsmith isn't really needed if you're doing a bunch of SBQ runs because you'll get the repair kits. I'll tend to run with 5 Int and put 2 pts in Demolition expert (for explosive guns) or Batteries Included for 2mm EC/Fusion cell weight management
---
I have a bloodied commando build, but handle the SBQ event a bit differently than most. I swap out my Unyielding armor for a full set of Zealot's armor (75% reduced damage) and can basically stroll around down there without any fear of death. I'll then use an auto rifle while she's in the air, and swap over to an LMG when she lands. There are certain combinations of legendary prefix and attribute that have an interesting (some say "magical") effect when applied at a high fire rate. This "effect" has been around for a while and was not resolved with the latest update.
---
It's not a deal breaker for many people, I just like it because I don't want to get diseases every time I go to my house in a lake or when I visit anywhere in the mire. Ghouls still give me rad worms by looking at me, but at least I don't get parasites every time I fast travel home.
---
Like the Collectron
---
While I try to remind people who don’t know most of the board, and that we don’t know how possible it will be to complete it (quite yet)
---
We also should make sure we keep talking to Bethesda so they ensure that events give us SCORE. 
---
I do agree though, that it’s only been one day, we should see how things unfold a bit first.
---
Yeah I run uranium fever on a private server with my team and we each look after one extractor. I get to loot most of the kills except those that were on the furthest side from me. If you run it again with a team try and stay around the middle and you should be able to loot nearly all of them🙂
---
E-v-e-r-y single day
---
Biught it last night and I didn't notice any physics on the backpack unfortunately.
---
Your mom sounds awesome
---
Not everyone get screwed equally. My Gunslinger just hit a real beauty - Furious Black Powder Pistol, +25% Faster Fire Rate, +15% Faster Crits Refill. 
---
Perfect, just so absolutely perfect. 👌
---
I imagine that's where I'll be getting most of mine, although I won't be all that heartbroken if I don't finish the track.  I am hoping we see some double-XP weekends in the next couple months.
---
well that's true
---
It’s from opening or being near someone opening a lunchbox , got it yesterday when tried mine
---
&gt; I dont expect to be thrilled by this game forever
---
Clearly not, it was in their text
---
is there an effect in there that replaces adrenaline.. cos Im getting my ass kicked...
---
Yea I've done the math myself and the increase in score required is only 25 per lev so lev 1 is 1000 100 is still only 3500 score which is 3 weeklies and 2 dalies to get from 99 to 100 I honestly dont see it taking more than a month for most dedicated player
---
Thank you for sharing! I still have a ways to go before I can purchase things with gold, but I will definitely snag this ASAP.
---
Could be someone spamming the ammo converter?
---
But why there's a wendigo collosus in Watoga?
---
Seasons should take 3 weeks of grinding at the beginning.  It’s insane that you have to do this just to finish it before the 10 weeks are up in my opinion.
---
You think they put it in there just to lie? You really think that? Why would they do that?
---
As a low level player (and even now honestly), I made my cap fortune in selling junk to other players through camp vending. Best sellers are acid, adhesive, copper, lead, oil, and steel. Runners up are aluminum and plastic. Set up a camp near the wayward (though, warning, creekfront property is popular, so you may have to server hop for a bit some days), sell all the spare ammo you pick up for a cap per (except for .50 cal balls, syringer, .38, fusion cells, and .10 cause they don't sell as often, if ever) and then sell your spare junk. You'll be cap flush in no time.
---
I think you’re giving them too much credit here. Sometimes boneheaded UI design is just boneheaded UI design. Plus, once your huge stacks of ammo are gone, it really doesn’t take much time. 
---
When we’re all in the habit of trading in our extra ammo each time we hit CAMP—which only takes a minute—we’ll forget all about how awful it was to turn in the 10 billion rounds of 38 we’d been saving up.
---
Yes, I just did that right now
---
But the game doesn’t cater to my exact needs so obviously it’s not implemented well
---
To improve your idea and ensure that only one screen is needed for all transactions, I would suggest this:
---
- The ammo converting machine is a trader.
---
- Selling ammo is done on the left and grants you points just like the scrip machine.
---
- Buying ammo is done on the right and works like Mmmrgh, with the choices never depleting.
---
- DESIGN DONE. It took one and a half minute to think of a better UI than the one they made.
---
$20 says if you’re at 99,999 xp when the weekly timer resets you’re going back to 0 out of 100,000.
---
Ok thanks, that's annoying but now that I know I'm not getting ripped off its not so bad
---
You don't have to 'make up' the missing score though, the point is that by doing all of those challenges that get you the 215,000, you will get the repeatable XP one naturally, with no further effort. So just by doing the challenges consistently you will in the end have enough for 100% completion. 
---
The only reason I even mentioned that part is because players who are really good at grinding will actually be able to shorten the time required, possibly even shaving off days or a few weeks.
---
There are definitely factual wrongs in what I'm responding to here, from numbers to projections.
---
Before this update I would log in daily to get at least 20-30 Atoms from some easy challenges. Now I would have to grind my ass off just to get a fraction of the Atoms I would get from casual play. No thanks.
---
Oh that's what it is, does it stack like each box is 25 or 75?.
---
100 spaces at n*25 + 1000 (n=0:99) is 223,750 in total. That’s the cumulative SCORE needed to make it to the last space, correct? Doing the daily and weekly excluding the repeatable XP is 215,000. This leaves 8,750 needed points from repeating the 100 point XP challenge, correct? Need to earn that 88 times then, correct? More than once a day on average.
---
I’m not one to play everyday either way, nor am I the type to spend money on micro transactions, so I’m just not going to get bent out of shape over it. To hell am I going to spend real money on atoms to buy score just so I can have a power armor skin in 76. That’s the market: keep them playing. The more they’re in the game, the more likely they’ll spend the cash. Give them FOMO and they’ll spend the cash. Catch those whales.
---
The purveyor is really just Fisto in a disguise. Assume the position.
---
Not the first time they screwing over their players, it's bethesda we talking about here.
---
community building
---
Totally agree. I use a Super Sledge so I'm fine since the Super Sledge  skin is only at about level 35-40, but for other weapons it's a lot higher.
---
One way they could get around this is instead of having these rewards at set levels, make each level where the skin rewards would show up a choice, so you can choose your favourite and then continue to grind if you use more or want the full set. Same could be done with the wallpapers and PA skins - have a choice of three, then 25 levels later you can choose between the two remaining, and then 25 levels after you get the last one. Would make it a bit more palatable since the rewards seem fairly top-heavy as is.
---
You grind because you choose to.  There is literally nothing you are going to get grinding the season that will make the core gameplay better or worse.      
---
I didn't grind before this update, and I'm not grinding after - and I couldn't care less about the ATOM store I have barely visited the entire time I've played.
---
Bunching 20 ppl with 0.01sec TTK = Watching Twitch but you paid for the game
---
What the game instead needs is more solo stuff, not group stuff.
---
apparently it's the source of dupes, so it looks like they've gone for this nonsense method instead.
---
this just happened to me for those same 2 challenges - "Build up workshop or CAMP" and "Gather Building Supplies" -  that is 2K SCORE I didn't get!  ouch...
---
I am certain because I was spending a bit of time in my camp specifically to complete these, and expecting the SCORE to pop knowing exactly when I finished them - but nothing.
---
Another interesting thing is I had the quest marked to "track" their progress and even after I completed them they were still marked for progress, even though they had the completion checkbox next to them.
---
You haven't put enough hours in the game then obviously! You'll get over it after a few thousand hrs of the crap.
---
Is it not my right to disagree with you? I try to offer evidence, and no matter what, you always ignore it. You have only ever shown me 2 videos of it “working” both of which have glaring flaws such as the Scorchbeasts ignoring the bait. I’ll gladly make 10 more videos in the next few hours (depending on how slow my internet is or if I can manage to record them in a smaller format) that show it doesn’t work. At the end of the day you’ll just keep sending the same video as “proof” because the truth of the matter is, you can’t reproduce it, because the code literally doesn’t exist
---
Well said, and a good laugh. :)
---
My thoughts on the ammo machine is I'd be pissed if I bought it with bullion but as a free reward it's not bad just time consuming.
---
ty
---
Forget the salt...I would take it with a shot of whiskey and celebrate because the grind only gets worst.
---
Ok, but the 90% is like 7 billion lol
---
Making corn soup...
---
1) Collect individual of the 20 corn
---
2) Collect individual of the 40 dirty water
---
3) Boil 40 individual dirty water
---
4) Make 20 individual corn soup
---
such a tiresome PITA
---
I agree!
---
Did you delete and reinstall? That happens on console.
---
This subreddit and the Bethesda forums have some of the most timid and unimaginative gamers I've ever seen - exactly the kind that latch on to any sort of rumor as fact.
---
Sometimes I read posts here and there and wonder if I'm playing a completely different game.
---
So the BOS makes ATLAS their base as it seems. makes sense, its a place of interessting technology...
---
I think there’s a saying of “looks can be deceiving”.
---
This is'nt helpful and detracts from the points OP made. I have 20k atoms and I believe that every release shouldnt have a mandatory post release patch. Why cant things be done correctly the first time? Why cant they act on our behalf? It's because they act on the behalf of the Zenimax share holders who want their bottom line profits. They see the investors and venture capitalists who made out like bandits on mobile, then fortnite and CoD and they want the same.
---
Yes, this is a known bug. Should you get rid of it? That’s up to you..
---
I couldn’t agree with this more, I turned off my Xbox last night, looked at my girlfriend who was studying and all I could say was “my god that was so fun” 
---
I see all these people complaining about this and that and I don’t know if they’re embracing how fun the teams feature just made the game
---
Thanks for your insightful and well written opinion.
---
They had one. I’m surprised they aren’t available again. I used one before lunchboxes were around lol
---
It takes more and more S.C.O.R.E. points to reach each level, 25 per level. Eventually that is going to slow. For example - From 99 to 100 will take something like 3500 Score points.
---
Not sure sorry only used one
---
I no it wasn't that one either though cuz number 10 was a 1star scorched beast I killed waiting on the nuke to drop
---
Once you die there's no reason to stick around unless you're trying to complete the "stay until the end of the match" challenges.
---
I didn't put it in a positive light, I put it in a factual light. If you still think it's garbage then that's fine, that's your opinion. If you think it's garbage because &lt;factually untrue things&gt; then that's not fine.
---
And if someone has the time or desire to play a game for a few hours a day every day, I don't think that's any reason for you to shit on them Mr Judgey.
---
After Division 2's season system, this is pretty non-sense. Just tie SCORE to XP and let people do what they want instead of hunting junk items or lvl1 mobs.
---
&gt; Is it not my right to disagree with you?
---
I literally just said it was your right. Do you even read the things you reply to?
---
Sure, go ahead. Post all the videos you want.
---
If it patches holes I put in people then what's the point lol
---
If I showed you ten videos of police killing innocent people and you show me one where they don’t, does that prove that all police are good but sometimes they just have poor judgement?
---
I will give it a shot but considering with a supposed 1500 rad resistance I managed to hit 600 incoming rads for a millisecond.
---
Yeah, like I said radiation Rumble is a different Beast.
---
Same thing happened to me. Wtf. Even says in their patch notes that they fixed a bug that caused challenges to complete automatically. 
---
Sure Bethesda. Sure.
---
Thank you for confirming
---
Right but intentionally lying? To what end. 
---
I know you are just complaining but you don’t really think they included it there for no reason do you?
---
I wonder if they are going to fix adrenaline before that...
---
I would add that while the terminal is already pretty bad because terminals are laggy and unpleasant, they still managed to push it further by reseting to the main menu after every transaction (really, what the hell?) and breaking down like 25 ammo types into 10 categories.
---
Same here lol.
---
Know what's gonna be funny when the people who play alot start complaining that there isn't any more rewards to get.
---
With all that's happening I think it may become reality
---
You used one and got the 75 buff? if so then I didn't need to use all 3 I had at the time haha.
---
Choice is the essence of gaming haha. I agree, and I hope season 2 is a lot more fun and gives more power back to players.
---
son of a... damn it.
---
In what way is it broken?
---
It's not a terrible addition, it's just misunderstood.
---
I see the ammo converter not being the mass-conversion tool people were expecting, but akin to scrapping. It's something one does with what they've collected on the current run -- one converts the few handfuls of ammo they just acquired to what they need to continue to survive. It fits in the intent of the world. It is a tool to improve survival. It was never intended to be the end-all, be-all for the guy that has been collecting every scrap of ammo since BETA.
---
And, admittedly - I am one of those people. I even bought 15K of .38 ammo from someone thinking I could quickly turn it around with the converter. I'm not at all mad. All that's happened is that my expectation and reality had different conclusions, I can't be angry for my own incorrect assumption.
---
No 1 or 2 levelups a day.. yaaah right.
---
Can't wait to get a protectron.
---
Just came here to check if anyone else was having this - glad to see I'm not the only one.
---
This comment is patently offensive. You should delete it and then feel bad for making it.
---
Are you just a sociopath who doesn't care about human life?
---
Wow couldn’t find one for the life of me
---
Oh I believe it was only 25%
---
Yeah I'm a big fan of it. Especially the bonus xp. I started last night at level 44, played for a couple hours just doing events, got up to level 47. Normally would take much longer to level up like that.
---
If you do enough events to earn your 20 treasury notes per day, you should get close to earning 1 repeatable.
---
Okay then. Great. Have you made people any more optimistic about Seasons? The correction of bad math is appreciated. Well done.
---
It still doesn't change the reasons people are upset and isn't going to make them not upset.
---
 [u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ladydevann/) in case this bug is not known...
---
That's my gt
---
It may have been the combat shotty in 3rd person it is like an auto scalpel
---
This will never be fixed, rubber banding damage has been a bug since I started playing, and I started in beta.....  ;-)
---
I buy skins specifically for this. I know, I shouldn't have to pay too ensure I don't accidentally scrap/sell my favorites, but I don't mind. What I do mind is they don't have skins for more than half of my faves!
---
now a random pack of super mutants can destroy everything INCLUDING THE KITCHEN SINK
---
Had a great impact on the game feeling like a multiplayer game rather than a single player game everybody shares.
---
Event participation is way up at everything, even the events nobody used to bother with. Difficult events like Radiation Rumble are completable.
---
If you get in a team with a low level it's much easier to give them a helping hand. I got in a team with a level 15 today and got free fast travel to their CAMP to help them with supplies, and they've got free fast travel to come to my CAMP and use my shower if they need to. I can also see if he's struggling with an area, fast travel there for free and tank a few enemies for them.
---
The only downside I've got now is I'm annoyed I've built such a low Charisma character and can't share any cards with everyone. Everything else is an upside.
---
Haha, that's fair.
---
Same. I use them to escape reality, not transfer the drudgery of chores from one venue to the next. As it stands now, with the new daily score, I will never finish them all.  Level up 1?  My character is a legit level 305.  Leveling up is not happening every day.  Maybe every 3 or 4 possibly. But as it stands I now miss out on 2 of the daily score challenges.
---
My other gripe is, for a renewed push on Events, maybe Beth ought to make sure Events happen. Server hopping is still a requirement to do what Beth is pushing.
---
I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum. And I'm all out of gum.
---
I like the idea of someone going to kill a SBQ and nearly dying to a cricket. A cricket.
---
Mind you I nearly died to a bunch of crickets. They’re the real threat to Appalachia it seems...
---
We have basically the same story haha. I came back during quarantine and I’m having fun now because hey, it’s something to do, albeit buggy and grindy.
---
Especially since the FAQ on their website says public events will regularly give you score. 
---
Hot damn this is an accurate post.
---
Fortunately I only paid 1 month of 1st just to get the Faschnat masks, I already cancelled because it's just not worthy for what little it offers. If Bethesda want to make the game a cash grab, at least put stuff worth buying, geez.
---
So you're saying this never happened before the patch?
---
Yep.
---
I was with my wife killing some scorched on a private server and, I started stuttering a little then crashed after I tossed a plasma grenade. It's a place we usually hit too.
---
Let’s try a different example then. I could show you 10 videos of nukes exploding and you show me one where it doesn’t. Are you going to argue that all nukes are manufactured as duds and these 10 just happened to be mistakes? You’re trying to say that, when there is more evidence against you, it’s still not correct because you saw it happen once. 
---
Guess what, all store clerks will give you a discount if you tell them they look nice today. I know because it happened once. The other ten times they didn’t are just outliers from the truth
---
I’m gonna simplify it down even further for you,
---
“If there are 10 things saying I’m wrong and 1 saying I’m right, then I’m right”
---
Just completed a weekly and was not awarded the 1000 score.
---
Ah okay, well its one or the other so I'll test them out when I get more. Thanks for clarifying for me.
---
its a well known bug 
---
weapons with a very high fire rate, or shotguns can have socalled "magic effects"
---
its a term thats used by a lot of players for the effects,
---
junkies/stalkers/instigating/bash damage/limb damage/vats hits chance
---
there are probably more these are just some examples i could remember
---
anyways those effects make it so that you use shotguns in vats they do insane damage, on high rate of fire weapons such as the lmg, they do this damage without vats on consecutive hits
---
its been in the game for a while and was rumored to be patched out with the latest update but apparently that didnt happen
---
the effect your describing, with health jumping back up is what the community calls "rubberbanding"
---
its a problem expecially common on shotguns but the health the enemy ends up with is usually the correct health the enemy should have after your hit
---
sometimes though it can be so bad that you sinply cant damage enemies at all
---
I actually came up with the same number you did, but saw other people posting a slightly lower number, so I just went with 220k to round it off. The extra 3750 doesn't seem significant to me, as the once a day completion of the repeatable was a cautious estimation on my part. It seems like XP is quite a bit easier to get than it first seems when confronted with the 10k number (but I'm going to confirm this shortly when I jump on to game!)
---
I'm pretty much on the same page as you for the rest of what you mentioned. I'd be fine with spending on MTX if the base game items (particularly camp stuff) were getting more update love.
---
"Will look into" is not gonna happen anytime soon. They are just saying that to keep people hopeful and content. There are already calculations based on score amounts we are getting that tell us that even if you do every single daily and weekly for 10 weeks you won't reach rank 100. So yea.. It is Bughesdas best interrest to not give us too much score because then people will go and buy atoms for the ranks they are not reaching by the end of the season. 
---
EDIT: Only thing that can be wrong about the calculations is the fact that we don't know if the amount of score needed per rank is going to increase by 25 every single rank up to 100. If it stops increasing at some point then it will be easier ofc. But i seriously doubt that the increases stop. Based on Bughesdas thirst for atom purchases.
---
It does not work anymore.
---
Basically they should make it work like the bullion, scrip, or caps, and just have it that you give it ammo, it gives you points.  
---
Even if the buying ammo for points part remains the same it would be better.  But the turning in ammo should function more similarly to the legendary exchange machine in that you put stuff in physically and get points out.  That way I can put in 1000 rounds at a time if I want.
---
Try 60% of the time and casually. A season pass that rewards the player with a tiny amount of resources/currency and a few cosmetics shouldn't be a hardcore commitment at all. I'd be hard pressed to make sure I got onto the game every single day if the reward was a massive game changing advantage.
---
The Chicken Coop looks nice, but it produces fertiliser. It's a glorified Brahmin plan. And it's in the last third of the rewards lol. And the Fireplace door is awesome, something I really want, but I'd rather pay 800 Atoms or 1200 for a bundle with my 1st sub than spend weeks of my life doing mundane tasks or running through the same dungeons and events I've been playing for sixteen months already.
---
Neat, a lot are not
---
Ditch the fucking things, they tax your ammo and are a pain to use.
---
Stick it in a vendor and sell for 1 cap, you can buy for 1 cap, nobody loses anything.
---
Or buy/sell bulk in market subs.
---
Ammo converters shouldn't be a thing until they're 1 to 1, set and forget ...
---
hopefully this is what happened for me (for the "Gather building supplies" challenge) - I do remember getting an unexpected 1K earlier in the day.  For the "Build up a workshop" challenge, i am certain it didn't trigger early, because I went to my camp with zero of the objectives complete, and completed them all in one go - got nothing for it
---
It basically increases things such as event xp or intelligence
---
Nice! Thanks for the tip!
---
When I go to put my tent down I don’t have the medic tent I have just the basic tent but I bought the Medic skin for my backpack which is supposed to when you pop it up look like a medic tent just wondering what I’m doing wrong
---
I'm glad you said this, the responses have shown me that I shouldn't worry about my inexperienced lvl 35 toon being a deadweight to all those high level players I see.
---
I may very well try it myself, I got on for about 3 hrs last night and just from playing normal (couple missions, crafting and looting) got to the third level of the new system without even trying to.
---
I'm on ps4 as well, hit me if ya want. The_Dude2k
---
That's gotta be one big ass rug lol
---
Thats the progress till that character has maxed out their bond with you, increasing your bonus in the group
---
Sun Kissed.
---
All those bloodied people jumped ship right away.
---
This. I'm honestly not entirely sure what the 'goal' of this thread is. To show OP is better at math than the other posters? Because it isn't reassuring people about progressing the Seasons all that much.
---
I thought it was due to XP repeatable but its gone now.
---
Yeah i've been bouncing between fo76 and persona 4
---
Yeah I get SCORE from events too, when I hit the 10k mark on my repeatable, otherwise I get nada.
---
events do not award score. despite what bethesda said.
---
youre just parroting shit
---
People don't like to think and prefer to assume that bad stays bad and good stays good.
---
 Bethesda has done a lot of questionable things, there's no doubt about it. So when people see two conflicting information about this, they are too comfortable to verify it and choose the one that shows that Bethesda are bad.
---
The opposite is true as well. CDPR rides on a wave of good hype, so any news about Cyberpunk is always viewed with good lenses, because it's confortable for people. Even though the various development struggles of Cyberpunk would cause other developer (like Bethesda) labeled as incompetent and lazy...
---
Might be one of the things you have to change via the Atom shop... if you select the medic tent from the atom shop, you should be able to mark it as the one to use in game
---
I understand where you're coming from. The only thing I'd add, not to encourage you to grind but just so you know, they do seem to have removed the tedious challenges from before. Take a pic in a radstorm type stuff is gone. All the challenges I've seen so far are so basic that I'm accomplishing them without thought (use 3 stimpacks, eat a stick of gum, get one level up, collect 3 purified water, etc.)
---
So basically, I have no interest in pursuing a grind and will not be logging daily, but I am progressing with no effort.

Bethesda gets a A+ for twisting words and shit mate , can't wait for the "oh we ment public event challenges from the weekly and daily tabs" or the "the xp from events will contribute to the repeatable weekly" 
---
After a few years you start to catch on how they work. 
---
It's just insulting that we get another time gated "content batch" that needs to be perfectly executed to even get to the end. 
---
Not to mention going from 7500 atoms to 1500 atoms. 
---
Bethesda hitting a new low with each update and its sad to see a franchise go to shit like this.
---
And yet the correct math still proves you can’t miss a single day to finish the season 🤣
---
I'm cancelling my 1st too.
---
the flamethrower -&gt; body catapult guy comes to mind for a skilled trap base (or deathclaw maze guy).  if someone took the time to design a system like that i wouldnt even be mad if i got got. id probably clip my PoV and send it to him so he could plan adjustments.

but yeah i agree with punji, its lazy, low effort garbage.  if you use punji, "git gud"

Try googling some of those commands that sit in the fallout76prefs.ini file. Might find some way to acheive what you want. Sadly I have no idea exactly what does what lol.
---
Does anyone's game actually run this smoothly?

Right here if anyone wants to see that bit for themselves.

This. The mental gymnastics apologists are pulling off here is Olympic level.
---
Question,say someone shoots at my teammate and he shoots back do I just have to shoot at the attacker to join the pvp or do I have to wait for them to have shot me also before I can shoot back. If you can't help your teammates without the person shooting you first that seems pretty annoying especially if they can just shoot your friend then ignore you and all you can do is the slap damage
---
You only get score from events when they are part of challenges. Beyond that they are not giving score.
---
And that doesn't include the fact that score level requirements increase 25 points per level meaning it'll take you 3450 points to go from 99 to 100.
---
I’m probably the guy who made that post. 
---
For everyone reading I take back the maths done in my post. It was done with yesterday’s xp I believe which was a littler lower than today’s Xp. 
---
And also we didnt know certain events gave xp as Well. 
---
On my behalf, Sorry everyone! 
---
BUT! After reading all the comments it became clear that the precision of math was not really important, clearly (due to the take-off) It was still clear that you would be short after completing all dailies and weeklies. 
---
Which seemed to be the majority of the problem. 
---
Because now everyone that couldn’t log on everyday would never see the end rewards, they knew already. 
---
(And tbh it took off like crazy even tho it started as a small rant, and clearly too early on I admit it)
---
So thank you for this post, from the guy who made the other post. 
---
Best regards
---
I had the points for the robots at 3/5
---
I’m shocked it took THIS long. I’m certain no one is buying this game.
---
Its called trying to give incentive to play daily
---
Good to know. I've been antsy because I've been helping a friend whose apartment burned down and I'm likely gonna have to miss some days. (I already missed yesterday's.) Thanks so much for breaking this down!
---
nah you hit the 10k XP repeatable or a daily/weekly challenge marker. There are no other ways to make score. Ive been testing it all day. Which is a days worth of testing more than Beth QA did. 
---
You currently dont get anything directly from events/dailies scorewise.
---
Cant wait to see what the Atlas Observatory will look like inside after the overall.
---
You share xp in a team? Do you have to be close to one another? I haven’t seen my xp go up aside from events. You talking about kills as well?
---
I’m surprised to learn I wasn’t the last stress-tester still hanging around here. Maybe I am now! I share your thoughts and I’ve been on the fence for a while. Post-fasnacht until yesterday was the longest break I’ve taken from this game yet, and now that the reality has sunk in that this is not the game I once loved anymore, I’m probably not far behind you.
---
Sounds like a song for Borderlands. But it also fits for the wacky side of Fallout.
---
Ye I tried a bunch of events today any none game me score. If that's added I'm sure it'll be achievable to complete the board.
---
I was at 2K score before i started. I couldntve gotten 8K right? Maybe it was delated from a prev one?
---
No shame in that game early on. It's usually not the queen that will get you, it's her mob spawns. You think you're big and tough chipping away at her health in \[Hidden\] until you pop into \[Danger\], have a Mirelurk Queen, a glowing Deathclaw, a Wendigo, some Radscorpions, a Yao Guai staggering you and a thousand scorched beating you down.
---
They knew people would bitch and didn’t care
---
I really want that skeleton lol I figure these might officially return in a few months but it's nice to get a head start
---
No you do.  I've had a large points boost after the one with the farmhands and still had 2000 to go to the reset.
---
I've even had it where is given me points when it says someone ELSE completed a quest and I'm just walking along!
---
If there is a pattern to it, I can't find it
---
Paypal, credit card...
---
I mean, the game is designed long term for whales, like every game. Designing an always-online MMO for players who pick it up for a few weeks when there's a content update, or play for a few hours once a week, isn't going to happen.
---
What game has a way of completing a seasonal battle pass only through play in the last 20% of it being active? I'm genuinely curious because I've never heard of that being the case and can't think of an implementation of that which would be accepted by the players who have spent months getting to the same point.
---
Major nerf to FO1st in patch 20.  Without being able to search for a team from your private world.... it is basically a sub for a scrap box at this point.
---
Not really sure why they decided to nerf the paying subscribers.
---
Also another question my girlfriend really enjoys the series but last August here in Dayton a shooting happened downtown at the bars and she was there. She cant really deal with the gun audio for games anymore which has really bummed her out. I know it's one person but there could be other people out there who are uncomfortable with the gun noise for whatever reason like PTSD and such and it would be really cool if there was a slider for just the firearm noise. I have a mod in 4 where you can turn down the gun volume separately so I know its something that can be done.
---
You can look in your challenges and see if there’s a bunch of challenges that you can complete for atoms to grind it out - I would check under like world and combat to see if there are any you could grind easily
---
Message me if you want a west coast time zone friend! I love having company and would love to help you out! I play pretty casually. I occasionally have another who joins me too if you’ve got a tough quest you’d like some (smol) muscle on!
---
&gt; 700xp per match
---
What? I wasn't even getting that with double Xp being in Top 5. Does being in a team matter? If im going to Bush Wookie i never join teams as its not fair to the team members.
---
I honestly can’t remember what it was like to play my build with every single effect working anymore. Ever since reloading broke unyielding (months ago) there has been some perk, legendary effect, or even just VATs not working at any given time that is pertinent to my build. I’ve just gotten used to playing “around” whatever is currently broken.
---
score and xp are different.    
---
you get 100 score when you gain 10000 XP from killing / crafting or quest completion.
---
Same. I figured “oh how bad can it be”.   I used it to convert two sets of ammo.  Never again
---
Agree, actually.  This game is an actual part time job with lots of different currency that you have to grind for.  When I'm done with the story quests, I'm gone.
---
Also, this grindy nonsense is the #1 reason why I don't recommend this game to any friends or family.  Basically... I want to keep them.  
---
The bugginess and instability is the #2 reason, plus the not so great UI that has to get fixed by mods, some of which were broken by the latest patch.  Never realized how much I relied on Ratmonkey's easy sorting, until I didn't have it anymore.  
---
Holy cow the default inventory sorting is terrible!
---
This game is reaching Destiny 2 levels of grind if it's not there already, and no matter how good the gunplay is in that game, I just couldn't take in anymore and quit.  Don't plan on going back there anymore, and if this game gets any worse, I can see more and more people jumping ship, honestly.
---
Crap like the near unusable ammo converter really doesn't help.
---
But Bethesda needs you to know each and every time you are earning free reuse cosmetic items!! 🙄
---
Noticed that too
---
Except that the new daily challenges are the same as the old daily challenges - the only difference is you get score and not atoms. It’s the same as it was- different kind of reward
---
Oh, I'm sincerely sorry if my presumption did somehow upset you, it was not my intention. 
---
About my average play time i'm clear enough about it: as I said I have little to no time during the week, except for my two weekends, during wich I can still spend half of the day with my hobbies, meaning i have anything between 1 to 10 hours to play this being the weekends maximum, for work days its at most 2 hour if I'd be blessed enough to not do any overtime, so this hour or 2 I prefer spending in F76 at the moment in order to sell/do some quick quests. I think now it's clear what my paying schedule looks like?
---
"Fallout76 is a game that is alive"
---
I don't think so, let's put it this way, the dungeons in skyrim were more alive than the F76 world, though it may not be what you meant, correct me if it's so.
---
"All that being said, you can still knock most dailies in an hour and weeklies in 2-3 1 hour sessions if not in one"
---
Once again you have to deduct from this hour the average load times, the fact that the events and quests are pretty bugged, and at times these don't appear as intended(well the wastelanders update fixed this a bit). Or the fact that if you don't have a party(public parties usually disperse instantly) you won't be able to do most of the events, and being alone will award you far less than a party would(most of the mobs drop and xp) NW is another level of hell, in order to do the(use 3 stimpacks daily I had to spend a whole hour, mostly because of the cheating(problem that is discussed already long enough), so the 1 hour per events is really a huge underestimation that doesn't include server bugs, constant overweight, the long load times when fast traveling and so on, and if OP's calculations are right you have to spend everyday in game, I didn't see such grind since I tried to play an F2PMMO, even that game didn't have such stupid limitations.
---
And for some reason you tend to forget, F76 is a game with a high enough price to at the very least not put such stupid restrictions on players.
---
And yes, everyone should keep to their opinions, so if you think that it's alright to make a full priced game a place full of micro transactions, then so be it, I just hope this is not the opinion of the majority of players.
---
Looks like a BoS protectron that actually patrols/defends the camp. Neat!
---
Can you post a video of you converting 10k of any ammo type in 6-7 minutes? I would be curious to see how reliable your terminal functions and how to do it faster myself.
---
Your comment gave me the idea to make a post. I made a post explaining it. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjhj5u/my_xp_farming_farming_run_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x
---
I agree with you. They're are either hitting the xp challenge,or it's that issue where it credits you score before completing a challenge instead of at the completion.
---
Most of them had it from scorched earth because it's one of the events with the highest pay off.
---
Yeah, agree.  Never liked these grindy "Season Pass" ish treadmills in other games, don't like this one either.  Preferred getting atoms to spend on what I want.
---
The only improvement is that some of the more obnoxious dailies (like the level up while wearing this and carrying that, while doing this crap) are gone.
---
Never liked being told what to wear everyday.
---
Oh ok sry
---
I would honestly prefer to pay £1.50 than spend the time it would take to earn that 3450/345,000 xp if I happened to miss a few Dailies late in the season. I'm even arguing this stuff for the sake of others; I'm subbed which means by the time we hit Week 10 I'll have 4000 Atoms saved up without even purchasing any to use as catch-up points. But it's the fact that this is clearly the intent behind the design/progression that is annoying. It's predatory. And a lot of people are plugging their ears and singing LAHLALAHHHH because negativity bad.
---
I know it's easy to say, but why not just go back to what you were doing in the first paragraph of your post. If there was story content locked behind this tedium I would understand the frustrations that you and many others are having, but it's what....a clean sink? ...a secret fireplace entrance?
---
You found some fun in the simple mechanics of the game, as you said. That's where I am too. Bethesda wants to pressure you along the winding gameboard path. Refuse.
---
I just bought a xbox card and got the bundle but buying atoms is the quickest or grind challenges that give atom's
---
Thxs for the Info going for a kida Rifle build but it should works thanks
---
Check the title. I had 2K xp no way i earned 8K i barely killed any mole miners and joined by the end
---
there is a rumour that the first event you do each day after reset gives 1000 score.     
---
I cant test that though until tomorrows reset. Maybe thats what you saw?    
---
I get other player caps/XP quest completion notifications sure. Ive never seen a SCORE increase from another teammates quest completions though.
---
Sweet thanks!
---
Well the problem is that these daily challanges are now our "summer content" given that nothing else is really happening. Challenges could be very well ignored before, but now they are the core of the whole seasons thing. And the seasons thing is pretty much our summer update.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Ah ok thanks cause I don't wanna buy atoms, I don't have the money sadly
---
We’ll taunt them by showing them that they could just press a button and the machine spit out bullets, but it doesn’t! Muahaha
---
I cant buy atoms, short on cash sadly, but yeah I'll try it
---
Emotions aren't productive agents of change when they're based on misunderstandings. 
---
We should be frustrated with the real problems and express those real problems to get real change.
---
So just a word of warning the Christmas items can only be unlocked one at a time. You have to earn each one and the points dont carry over so it will take 27001 xp total to unlock them all. The Halloween ones can be worked on concurrently so it only takes 14000 XP total to unlock them all.
---
We dont get atoms anymore!? Oh damn i swear theyre just trying to kill this game off
---
I wouldn't say *every* update.  Wastelanders was good.  The update with the sheepsquatch storyline was good.  Player vending was good.
---
But yeah, I get your point and I agree.  Over time they have nerfed a lot of the fun things and added more grinding.  This is not the kind of content I'd hoped to see added.  
---
I have over 1,900 hours in this game so I have gotten my money's worth, but renewing Fallout 1st is probably not gonna happen when my year is up.
---
Close to 1000 levels over 7 seperate characters... The trick is not too over do it.
---
If you don't enjoy it maybe it's time to move on
---
Yeah I need 809 for him alone and I have 125, so I'll hurry
---
I truly feel the same way. At first I was like man this is Awesome I got scrap box and going to get a ton more. But nothing really is fun, I use to play on my server but now I don’t ever get on there so it’s a waste. I would love for it to change but I don’t think it will
---
Mine seems a lot laggier after the update.
---
Oh I don’t doubt that at all, as it is I try not to play near the weekly timer reset, just to avoid issues
---
I think the legendary run gives atom rewards too
---
That’s okay I’m in the same bot- just been saving up from weekly and daily challenges for a while. I did notice they’d added new challenges - like kill Arthropods (bugs) and aquatic/semi-aquatic creatures (mirelurks etc) so some of those might be easy to do :) I hope you are able to get your jacket
---
War never changes. But the ammo converter probably should.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Except that if you're the one using the Cryolator, you're not doing enough damage to get credit for the kill. Ref: my last SBQ fight
---
Or if that event makes you hit the xp challenge threshold.
---
Events x se don't give any score.
---
noooo you cant just tell people that their hate is ridiculous111! you must be a (opens youtube video to find latest beth bad buzzword) todd boot licker111!
---
I’m literally looking at this for the first time. I’m on vacation and not even in the game. Your post was the first I saw. The number I got was from just using Excel drag down then sum. Assuming the 25 addition each day from a 1000 base, which I just took on faith.
---
Whale hunting makes money. Money is needed to float the servers and fund new games. Personally, I’m not doing it. Not even a little. I’ve seen gambling addiction and it can really ruin a household. What everyone is expressing in this frustration is FOMO. And since you can go cash to atoms you score, you are one credit card away from relieving your FOMO. Dangerous.
---
We've been asking for a lock forever, so good luck.  The current work around is to add a paint job to the item.
---
Time to move the whole camp
---
Thanks, cause there is 12 days left for the sale and I'm hoping they either lower the price on the last few days or I get enough. Thanks for the help comrade.
---
I got 713xp today by getting 4th place. It varies a lot due to match time, i believe you get around 300xp for 20 minutes survived but i noticed matches ending incredibly fast lately. Being in a team doesn't matter, just time, placement (when you're in the top 10) and npcs/players killed. I used to consistently get over 800xp per match when double xp was active, just cause of match time.
---
You still get atoms from the other challenges - just not weekly or daily - so world challenges / combat etc are still there and there’s even been some new ones added in that I noticed so I would check them out
---
Awfully presumptuous to assume there’s a QA team
---
I'll try it
---
What keeps you playing? And do you normally solo play?
---
You’re welcome. If you try it out let me know what you think.
---
So how he fixed it. Logged off and reloaded the game. Gotta love more bugs.
---
The Flyboy outfit and helmet are pretty cool. The helmet especially as it has a light, so no more green pipboy light when wearing it. Just try grind out some of the world challenges or whatever and you should be able to earn it, good luck
---
Where do I find challenges?
---
Looking online it seem like it will on the 9th. Though I heard all this before (too many times to count since launch) so I'll wait and see. Be good if it does though :D
---
This community is beyond annoying. They complain 24/7 about everything - if I complained about a game as much as they do, I would simply just quit, but these dudes are relentless. People are on here complaining about the season pass even existing for god's sake.
---
The teaming up is a success imo. The season is kind neat I guess but I can't imagine it appeals to most people. I might play a few days a week anymore and just because their a children board game in the mix doesn't make me want to log in to do the same stuff over and over.
---
I think a lot of people are just disappointed. I've never been into challenges for atoms. It annoys quite a bit really, the atomic shop is like the primary game focus and its just awful. They changed the challenges some sure but they still aren't anything special. So basically this huge update to release more cosmetics and stuff that I personally don't care about and because of the format am very unlikely to get anyway.
---
Improve the RNG, introduce more weapons and in game obtainable outfits, add more dungeons (Burroughs was almost a success), fix the raids (again almost really good). This is a gimmick and i'm a little mad about it.
---
I can definitely see that for sure - it would have been a better update if the colossus event and legendary perks had been ready to go with the season like initially planned
---
I would say you are objectively wrong considering the outrage posts and the upvotes they are getting seem pretty significant even with misunderstandings of the math; because even your math leads to exactly the same dissatisfaction and indignation. That said, I'll leave you to it. This entire discussion is unproductive as your post isn't going to change whats going on and my posts aren't serving any purpose either.
---
It's good but endurance bonus is still broken. It doesn't give any HP boost and most likely not any other boosts either.
---
Weren’t the BOS quests supposed to come with patch 20? I was very excited and then very confused when I didn’t see anything in the game(besides the radio signal). Did I miss them postponing it or something?
---
I had this issue this morning.
---
Loged out and it "fixed" the problem.
---
It will be back for sure.
---
You open your menu when you’re in a world and in the drop down should be a “challenges” menu and you can look under character / world / combat etc and you and even track them so you know your progress
---
Congrats, because of this bug you can no longer achieve rank 100 without paying Bethesda. Isn’t that terrible for Bethesda.
---
I believe my point was merely expressing my opinion, backed up by over 1900 hours in game. 
---
I still don't claim to be an expert, so I only speak for myself.
---
it doesn't work. at all. no bonus damage whatsoever :(
---
I had a challenge to do a public event and level my character yesterday, are we sure this isn't what they mean?
---
I was genuinely shocked when I clicked it and it wasn't like the legendary exchange. They already had a perfect design. I just don't get it.
---
Fix it Good, yup, but I'd still prefer to not deplete my precious stash of screws. It's only a problem if I decide to boost it, though (repair to 100% as soon as parts degrade to 99%: repair, kill one scorchbeast, repair, etc.).
---
Gross. I hope this is a troll post. 
---
&gt; First, theu give us great patch notes with everything explained in great depth
---
This is not a great favor. Every developer should post detailed patch notes without question. This has been a sticking point since the beginning and I imagine there are a host of undocumented changes the community will post soon. 
---
&gt; Next, they fix the water mill and make it generste power
---
Such a nice gesture charging me 10 dollars for it and breaking it 2 days later for 2 months. That shit should have been hotfixed in under 24hrs. Nice of them to steal the communities idea that it should generate power without indicating they should have done so originally. Not even an apology just an acknowledgment it was poorly thought out. 
---
&gt;  I know this is unpopular but I would rather have pre-determined prizes than having to wait weeks for the things I want to appear in the Atomic Shop
---
It appeals to some and not others. I see it for the thinly veiled cash grab that it is and a total waste of resources that otherwise should have been spent fixing literally any of hundreds of game breaking bugs that exist now or working on combat system rebalance. 
---
&gt; But most importantly, public teams! 
---
Agreed. I was leading one all last night and constantly had bonded xp boost so that was nice. A step in the right direction for sure. Doesn't really matter though if we take two steps back with every 1 forward.
---
I'd like that. I think that'd be cool
---
He actually put factual information for you to make your own judgement, but because he wasn't BETHESDA BAD like you wanted to hear, that's somehow... putting it in a positive light? This is the exact reason why bullshit spreads because it's not about factual information, it's trying to get your narrative out there.
---
oh yeah, totally agree, may be negligible to the point of not worth mentioning, I just wasnt actually totally clear on how it all worked lol
---
That's absurd. They should be a time fair for everyone or localise it to each timezone. 7pm is way to late to be reasonable.
---
I don't know why people even bother upvoting this OP that can't even do the exact math.  The right math is here (and to the guy that gilded OP, did you even read?)...

Also i was at over 10k rad resist and still taking a bunch because as mentioned it's broke.  Not the rad shield, that works, but rad resistance in general
---
Agreed thanks for sharing, OP
---
I think I know the one you’re talking about.  I’ve seen some really awesome ones, and I never got mad about those. 
---
The ‘hurr durr punji gotcha’ are just... disappointing. And anyone being ‘proud’ of that is  even more disappointing.
---
They'll mostly leave you alone when you get higher level. I don't usually get bothered but my characters are level 180 and 260.
---
&gt; I’m surprised to learn I wasn’t the last stress-tester still hanging around here. Maybe I am now! 
---
Nope.  I was here for the stress test too :-)
---
That's around 4-5% of the score requirement to get to rank 100.
---
Remember, every rank goes up by 25 score, so your progression is going to slow down a lot.
---
Aren’t we some poor, lost souls 😃
---
Either it’s an oversight or a bug. To call it a “lie” means it is intentional and they are just trying to mess with us.
---
Also they told us atoms were going down. 
---
They were never 7500 in 10 weeks... not sure where your math is there. And it’s currently 2000, not 1500. At least cite accurate numbers.
---
I got home at like 5am jumped on and finished 3 weekly and 5 daily challenges before like 630 and I'm almost level 6 now in the season, I barely played at all and got all of that done.
---
Cave crickets are the real enemy
---
I like using it with a stealth build, I can deal 1200-1400ish with a headshot w/o any bow perks, using a B 50 25 Bow
---
Yes I know. But I don’t usually break away from my route to start it. Some days I will start it manually myself if I’m wanting to specifically do that event.
---
My friend gets it at 21:00 living in Eastern Europe sucks
---
I found it, thanks.
---
Thanks for the reply and I hope my post doesn't come across as mean in any way. I'm sure you were just expressing your frustration with the system and I get that, but I think a lot of people were upvoting your post because they were bothered by the season's grind, rather than looking at the numbers to see if they could complete it.
---
Anyway, there seems to be a lot of room for seasons to improve. I hope Bethesda listens to the feedback as it evolves and makes meaningful changes for next time (or maybe even some catch-up events for this season).
---
I would submit a ticket and a bug report ASAP honestly so they’re aware and it doesn’t keep happening
---
Oh wow lol. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Good luck!
---
Ideally I would want to see public events giving a decent amount of score and non-public events giving a smaller amount of score. The concept of not all events that anyone can join not being an actual public event is a whole other thing. Especially since the game doesn't clarify that there's even a difference between the two.
---
I Deleted game and canceled f1st subscription this game will be coming out on mobile soon. I’m pretty sure a high end tablet can handle the 4x the detail of fallout4.
---
Hey, you're right in my opinion, but this is Bethesda we're talking about.  Overpromising and underdelivering (and throwing in lots of bugs to boot) is their MO.
---
I'm reasonably sure I canceled my Fallout 1st after 1 month, but somehow it seems to have reactivated and charged me again for a 2nd.  Trying to get Steam to refund me right now, but if they don't... oh well, I guess I'll spend the atoms or something.
---
I do hope they listen to you though.  Paying customers like you (especially those who bulk buy 1 year in advance) really do keep them afloat, and if they piss off those customers, I can't see how they think they'll continue to stay profitable over a long period of time.
---
Or at least, as profitable as they could be.  Any long lived and well performing business knows that if they're not some kind of monopoly or duopoly with a captive market, that customer satisfaction has to be #1.
---
If you were at 2k xp on the repeatable after you finished the event, chances are you earned enough xp from completing it to get over 10k and end up at 2k, some events regularly award over 1000xp for completion and if you were in an event group then that xp is doubled
---
Ironically the crickets are the biggest threat mob-wise, especially the piercers. Or god forbid legendary piercers.
---
Aw punpkins, you figured me out. But public teams are really great
---
Anytime 👍
---
1% if not counting new players (less than 50 level) most of the people i encounter is bloodied/unyelding. Im one of the few furious builds. I think its more like 60%bloodied/unyelding  20% junkie and then you have the rest.
---
Caveat on T-Notes:  
---
You apparently do not earn T-Notes until after you have completed the vault raid.  (If you haven't, you do not get T-Notes for completing events)
---
and
---
Gold bullion is not the same as gold scrap/ore.
---
Beautifully terrifying
---
The point I was driving home is they aren’t permanent.
---
This was something WOW did once. We all had to complete certain challenges to unlock this new island. It was really neat
---
Yup. Started a new toon and with killing a Grafton monster, I player and getting to second place in one match I levelled up from 0 to 2. Much easier!
---
I was at 2K before the event I should clarify.
---
Because we’ve been beta testing this early-access title for two years
---
Yeah. Its going to bite them in the butt
---
then dont pay for it?? lmao
---
I agree!! Loved playing with a team, I've only done it successfully 1/2 times
---
We did something similar last year didnt we where we had to kill I forget how many millions of scorched.
---
HeHe that can explain it also!
---
We did that, we even reset our consoles and the router. I’m still tanking BE laser rifles, I’m still not doing the damage I used to either.
---
I recently just got a nice roll fixer. Before that I haven’t got a good roll weapon in maybe 2-3 months
---
Same boat for me. Every addition to the game in the past few weeks has been fantastic.
---
They invented a grinding motivator for old challenge content. Nothing special and new was added just a time waster.
---
This has been going on since Skyrim with smelting ore. it should be 100 iron ore, gives you the option of a sliding scale how much you want to smelt from 1-100, click once then get however many number of metal. Instead you have to go one by one.
---
Yep - would be nice to see changes in game as opposed to unlocking atom shop items (not that I don’t like free things) but it’s neat to have an actual impact on the game
---
Your progress is linked to your Bethesda.net account
---
Now they just need to give shared XP and loot for teammates indipendent of tagging and increase the ridiculously low stash size and the game would actually even be half decent.
---
At this point I feel we need to transport Liberty Prime through time and space to Appalachia and have cave crickets listed as communists...
---
The fact is they should absolutely respond. Anyone who expected to grind it out in a week had the wrong expectations. It should be an achievement to get it all. The question is, how reasonable is the grind. Right now it seems ok. If you can play regularly and do all weekly/dailies you will make it to the end. The real question is around how events play into all this. 
---
They do have very poor PR and communications lol
---
Nono! Not in any way my friend. 
---
Yes the numbers seemed to be less important in the discussion. 
---
But I’m glad you made this post. 
---
And yes. Lots of time for improvements. 
---
I’m letting my post stay so at least the devs can see what people might have a problem with as well. But let this post become top instead. 
---
Stay safe man.
---
Edit: I have linked this post in mine so people can see. Hope that’s okay
---
So I'm going to get a second account for free on PC. Excellent news.
---
Step in the right direction I must say
---
Maybe I should have put a /s at the end... I have a mediocre Junkies weapon for the people that won’t take off rad sponge, but I don’t have armor geared for those situations. It’s satire. Not obvious satire, as is evident by your reply and the downvotes.
---
But let’s just say for a moment it’s not satire. If I can go toe to toe 3v1, and beat them all, it’s clear my build is far superior.
---
I find the urge to draw a cave cricket riding on the back of a yao guai into battle.. they would be too powerful...
---
Even for Xbox cus I’m on Xbox?
---
I would like this for junk items as well, had a Scorched head in a jar, and it got scrapped while I was building my camp. Now I got to go looking for another, who knows how many unique junk items Ive lost that I like to display at my camp.
---
I kinda agree there. People complain about time-gated rep grinds but at least those let you do what you need to do and then play other games. Season passes are built so that you can only really focus your free time on one game if you don't want to miss out.
---
True I agree. I know it's a pre cursor to BOS. I'm guessing bethesda already has the design set but we will all build it and can only think it works by gathering materials
---
nice to see some positive responses. I haven't earned the ammo converter yet, and from all the posts I've read, I'm scared to :)
---
This is all i cared about. How long is a season
---
I got Good Doggy for food and the Nuka Cola perk for thirst, but I can't ever find enough of them to totally ditch cooked items.
---
Bloody hell, if that’s the case nevermind Liberty Prime, we need another nuclear war.
---
I like the converter, just let me ya know choose to convert 1k 10mm rounds at a time so it doesn’t take me a lifetime to convert.
---
34 hours is based off of doubling the best case rate of the repeatable, as you have to account for inventory management and that not everyone has a great xp farming route. 
---
And again, we are talking best case scenario here.
---
Looking at a system and saying "hey, this could really use a redesign" is not a crazy thing to say up front instead of waiting until the end of the season. The math isn't going to lie, this isn't a subjective topic. You can't just bootlick your way into more points. But by all means, good luck.
---
So for those that can’t play everyday, we’re basically screwed... nice
---
I straight up stopped reading when you tried to counter bad math your your bad math.
---
One of the first statements you make is 2000 score from dailies when today only had 4x250 dailies.
---
Was just looking for something like this. My wife JUST finished the building weekly and didn’t get SCORE. She said same thing happened with another challenge before but she doesn’t remember which.
---
Edit it was awarded early! We just added up all her numbers and she’s not missing anything. Saw a comment that it’s a bug that has been acknowledged already
---
Yeah, the ship hasn’t moved, still at the start, not showing I’ve got any points yet when I go into the challenges menu it shows them as being complete.
---
No hard feelings. I just wanted to address this, as it can be inflammatory and does not promote dialogue. I understand  that it feels to you and many others that getting to complete the season is a grind. What many fail to address is this simple truth: You do not HAVE to complete it. You do not HAVE to do anything you do not enjoy and does not make sense for you. My entire premise here has been the comparison between the old and new style of challenges. You did not HAVE to do atom challenges either. Everyone can decide what feels natural/worth/fun and do that. 
---
In regards to microtransactions on a "full price game", I generally have no issues as long as said microtransactions do not offer a significant competitive advantage (i.e pay-to-win). I said that F76 is alive in the sense that game content is not static and DLCs are indeed rolling and free. Continuous development and operation have costs that a single player game simply does not have.  
---
Just to conclude, yesterday and today I have played about 2 hours in total and finished all dailies for both days, apart from NW, and all weeklies. I all happened quite naturally and I am now at level 11. It will be tougher later and that is fine. I will not program my life around that and will not feel any pressure to devolve into playing to the point where I just mindlessly grind. I hope we can enjoy the game and our lives like that.
---
You get a bonus based on the team type. Not always straight xp boosts.
---
I was really hoping that would be in there too (I was taking a break then), but no such luck.
---
That’s the issue. I for one know how easy it is to focus so much on the Queen that mobs that shouldn’t go unnoticed sometimes do.
---
What island was it?
---
Annoying that it’ll only allow a fixed amount (30 ammo or 100) at a time want the choice to say yeah all this type of annoying up to the limit
---
Wife just completed building weekly and didn’t get score
---
I don't know what you're smoking but please share lol.
---
That post has the same math, the same conclusions. I rounded to 220k, it's inconsequential. The dude's whole message in the end is that if you skip dailies you will come up short, which is in agreement with my post's message: That you can get completion if you do every challenge. 
---
The real difference is I've also pointeed out that you can further shorten that challenge with XP farming and atom recycling.
---
*steps onto soap box and taps mic*
---
No one from Bethesda gives a shit.
---
I'm with the OP. I have a full time job, a wife, and other responsibilities. There is  no way my ass will ever grind to level 100 of this new seasons bs. I still haven't finished the wastelanders storyline. If I was a highschool kid or a streamer I'd be set, but I have a life. I don't mind playing and doing the tasks to unlock stuff but there is no way in heck I'll ever unlock level 100 or probably even level 90 stuff. . Some of those skins are cool as heck do I need them, no. Do I want them, yes. Do I have the time to earn them, FUCK no. 
---
*steps off soap box
---
It spawns 6 percent of the time in a nuke zone plus the event would give me rewards
---
Nice, can you also calculate what we'll need if I skip out on every NW award? Can't really do those since I'm using mods.
---
If you've not done the 'kill x amount scorched with' challenges just remember Morgantown airport counts. That way you don't need to worry about builds, you can slam them with anything. Also for the mod armor/weapons ones you can just repeatedly mod the same item. The easiest ones are probably the take photos in or discover regions.
---
Activate the drinking animation, then spam collect.
---
It was for something in Pandaria - that’s all I really remember.
---
I can finish a Smite battle pass with about a month to spare if I stick to playing 3 casual matches a day (Arena, Joust, and Assault). So maybe about an hour a day with a whole month extra in case I don't want to play every day. That might be off a little because I would skip a day here and there but play a few on the weekend. Each of those matches is usually around 10-25 minutes.
---
I’ll see you in a few years when fo5 is released
---
There's also a plushie
---
No they arrive with the fall update.
---
Ok, thanks, should I do it alone or with someone? Because in xbox for the public posts, it's literally people selling crap, so idk if I can find someone to help me here or anything. But I'm good solo, some guy gave me a crap ton of stimoacks which was really nice. I'm only lvl 8 so if I'm bothering you with all these questions I'm sorry.
---
Don't forget to take off Lone Wanderer too.
---
The one thing I don't like about teams is that since I've played solo the whole time before, my Charisma is 2 and I can't share any cards. Makes me look selfish in the team!
---
It boils down to 'they are cheating' so for many it must be stopped. personally I don't really care one way or the other. The problem lies in that some of the ways to dupe require crashing the server, that I hate.
---
That sucks. Hope u will resolve the issue by sending them a ticket bcz the most valuable rewards are gold lingots, caps and scrips. Maybe atoms if u ever go to the store.
---
I definitely need a boost too. I play a bunch of games, which means when more then one of them use this same kind of pass system, I kind of have to put one to the side, and Fallout 76 just happens to be that game.
---
Red Dead has the best battle pass. Just go have fun and anything that grants Xp goes towards the pass progress. And it levels up fast, unlike every other pass I’ve tried, where progress is glacial.
---
i will probably get lots of downvotes but the converter is free, you literally only need to to like 5-10 challanges to get it (probably less) so i dont get why lots of people are complaining
---
i guess it could be because their expectations were higher and people finally could get something from the 300,000 .38 ammo everyones carrying
---
or i suppose that people are mad about how tedious it is to use
---
Nah some people like nuclear winter - you don’t have to play it. Just focus on the repeatable weekly instead - it’s easy to do multiple times in a day just playing adventure mode normally
---
You cannot complain about bad math if you don't provide exact numbers - I'm not smoking anything other than not buying into your BS.  Your post is redundant and totally unnecessary when the info has already been presented correctly in a concise and readable manner.
---
Karma whore much?
---
Yes your character is stored server side but linked to your gt, so as long as 76 is compatible (it will be I'm sure) you'll just reinstall and off you go
---
Edit: I'm on Xbox too
---
Yeah, that really gripped my shit!
---
I get the impression a lot of the complaints stem from wanting to grind it fast however, and as I said the wording was very ambivalent, and gave the impression on a casual scan that rewards from events would be repeatable. The fact it's a huge reward and apparently not a repeatable small reward is not on the player really.
---
I'm not surprised by any of it, as it's supposed to be long term grind/reward content, but it was definitely handled in a weird manner and the lack of information on top of it not being explorable in the test is not ideal. 
---
The top end unlocks are absolutely for the no lifers and not the casual, and it's technically possible without spending real money/atoms.... But it's also technically possible I could discover a  new form of renewable energy walking to the shop. It's never gonna happen but technically there's nothing stopping it.
---
That's the angle they're playing, like many games with real money currency. The more I think about al lthe different transactional materials and their limits, the more I'm certain the event reward is just singular, and the grind is exactly that- a grind unavailable to most people without cash money.
---
Got a link to Bethesda's response to it?
---
Ah okay, thank you.
---
Public Teams are the best thing that's ever happened to 76. At least ten people in three event teams decimated the Sheepsquatch, and three nukes were launched consecutively, drawing at least two other event teams to take down the Queen. I've never seen events go so smoothly.
---
Even Uranium Fever, which I normally just solo, had about six other people.
---
It was *glorious*.
---
Isn’t he a complicated book character in the universe?
---
He's a comic/show character just like the other unstoppables
---
He was a character on a TV/radio show.
---
The new daily challenges aren't _hard_. Scrap 5 springs? Do a bulk and scrap it. Eat bubblegum? We get those every 5 levels, and tehre's more at Tyler County if you need 'em. Even the ol' "level up while" challenge has become "level up once", no conditions. 
---
The only ones impossible for me to complete are teh ones that ask me to log in to NW, because I have mods and thus can't.
---
I enjoy he way you’ve written this. Can I be a dick and ask your political affiliations? 
---
I’m honestly just curious. No judgement at all.
---
And raise their cap limits
---
That's a pretty valid point. And, yeah, they will need to adjust progression. Even Epic figured that out early on. I was more just joking that now we'll get see the same sort of complaints other games get.
---
That's probably a good thing, having ghille for the armors you use in NW would've caused more hiding, AFK Players, and what's noticeable PTW (when tier skips become available 2 weeks from now) I'm glad your not able to use the skins for NW
---
Yeah, there was someone showing they had a little over 60 Intelligence plus exp buffs saying how easy the repeatable is to do. I play casually and don't run that build so I might hit 20 intelligence if in a group. I honestly never looked but I don't get that much of an increase. I don't want to change my entire build just to get more exp then change it but when I want to play the way I want.
---
Indeed, under the current parameters, that estimate feels *way* off.
---
It's obvious they want people to spend real money on it to finish it. Even if you play every day, complete all possible challenges, you still wont make it to 100.  
---
Stop defending greedy companies, you are only doing a harm to you, and fellow players.
---
Both me and my grandad have been having the same issue as you before Patch 20 but it’s been even more prevalent for us since then.
---
Well hopefully they respond. It’s only been a day. I just wish people acted a little more mature with their criticism.
---
Yes!! That was it. I hadn't leveled up past the minimum level to open this card... I'm guessing anyway.  I had so many saved up perks... I needed to use some.  Thanks for all the replies!!
---
They seem significant to you, but are they significant to Bethesda? If the criticism that is upvoted is based on a faulty understanding of the system, is Bethesda likely going to change that system?
---
That's the problem for me. We can't be basing criticism on misunderstanding of things. If it's 10 weeks to complete and we say hey, it's 13 weeks to complete, this is unfair, Bethesda can make a total of 0 changes and then say "Look now it's 10 weeks to complete!" and they'd be right. xD
---
The focus should be on specific points that can be changed, IMO. Like a lot of folks have mentioned one problem being that you have to log on every single day. That's something that I think Bethesda can and just might be willing to work with, possibly by providing catch-up mechanisms.
---
Stop defending greedy companies, you are only doing a harm to you, and fellow players.  
---
The moment people realize they can't get all the rewards people will quit, this is how online games work. And then you are going to play with very few players, eventually your beloved game will shut down by then.
---
Don't has the moneis
---
Awesome, doing that now, up to the Snowflake paint, Jack o' lantern paint next.
---
There is no new content to unlock - so stop grinding and go back to enjoying the game the way you chose to enjoy it before.
---
New content is new questlines, new NPCs, map expansion - not bathroom sinks and PA skins.
---
Yup as do I. It would solve a lot giving like a half hours worth of official response work to allay and clarify things everyone is mindlessly and endlessly speculating on because they have no other info.
---
Yup. Spend them until level 50. Then you can play around with you build.
---
I agree that spreading misinformation about the season is bad but the grind definitely needs to change. This stuff needs to be accessible to people that have lives, not just people that play the game 24/7.
---
Yeah  literally reinstalled it yesterday. That must be it. Thanks
---
Need 5 points in intelligence for the weapon modding at level 5 so 3 in nerd and the odd 2 in weapons. Yep I rub dense mod on the chest and why only 1 in adrenaline. I get it if your just blasting normal runs but on anything big like the sbq your giving up 60% damage if u pop off 5 of the scorched hanging about.  Edit. Don’t run explosive or energy weapons
---
Agreed. This brings the community closer together and gives it more MMO feel. Even if the group isn't working together in one spot, still sharing perks and giving each other benefits feels... right.
---
The 1st day was easy. I found 3 stim packs, ran into the fire zone used all 3 then stayed in it till I died.. That completed the daily.
---
 Today's sucked. It took me 4 matches of joining a team and hiding in a bush for me to level up.  Not going to pass up that 250 score though.
---
IIRC the biggest challenge will be the weekly repeatable, which can possibly be achieved with a setup geared towards XP farming (events or hunting team, Inspirational 3, Cranberry Relish, Well-Rested, Int boosts from Berry Mentats and SB Brains).
---
EDIT: add Egghead boosted with Strange in Numbers I guess to further boost INT and get more XP per kill.
---
Dude the fear attack is totally choreographed. The Colossus goes into a long animation where it squats down and breathes in before it screams, plenty of time to position yourself so you don't flee into one of the environmental hazards.
---
Its damage resistances are similar to the Scorchbeast Queen's, but it doesn't fly around all the time, its attacks are more dangerous, and the adds are stronger and drop better loot, so overall it's a much more interesting and faster-paced fight. Once this event is released people are only going to farm the Scorchbeast Queen for Ultracite mods, this boss fight is better/more rewarding in every other way.
---
These daily challenge, daily time gate mechanics are straight out of the greedy MMORPG  handbook.  Make players feel like they have to log in every day, check the store and make more micro transactions.
---
I actually stopped played an MMORPG I had played for years for these very reasons.  I don’t need chores and goals set for me when gaming. I don’t care what the newest shiny particle effect item is and I am not going to chase it.
---
I believe this type of system will ultimately alienate a percentage of the player base who feel they “can’t keep up” and they will quit the game.
---
Vacation houses usually have TVs but I get what your saying ( my wife would never let me take my xbox on vacation) and if your pc then that would probably be even harder to pull off lol
---
People just love to complain but it’s really not that bad. Once you get rid of your bulk ammo then you can just use it periodically for the ammo you find here and there, I like it
---
We deserve a quadruple XP weekend for all the shit Patch 20 has bought us.
---
So where would u allocate the 5 points u freed up?
---
Lone Wanderer gives you AP regen I think.
---
probably angry their punji boards dont stack anymore
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
He's a fictional character within the fallout universe, from comics/ radio/ TV in the fallout world pre-war, created by Hubris Comics who also produce the Unstoppables comics and characters. Jangles the Moon Monkey is his sidekick, who you can find the plushie of in the game (though the plushie doesn't really look like the character, Jangles is just a normal monkey in the orange Captain Cosmos suit while the plushie is some weird zombie-faced monkey in a more detailed spacesuit.) The board game used for the season ranking menu is meant to be a board game that would've existed within the world.
---
Instead of saying "Too bad, deal with it" you should be saying "There should be options for both groups of people". People who only like NW have to go to the mode they don't like to progress while people who absolutely do not like NW have to do it to progress. Adventure at least has a repeatable if you really want to grind it out. I don't know if NW has a repeatable but from I read the exp gained from it does not count toward the adventure repeatable. There should be enough options for both sets of players instead.
---
I can see the crashing servers part, but if they focused on improving their servers it wouldn't be an issue. People getting mad about cheating in this game are the same people that got mad at single player exploits. If you dont like it dont take part in it. Its not that hard of a concept.
---
I think it's the best multiplayer sandbox experience I've ever seen, I used to joke around with my mates about paying fallout 3 NV and 4 together, we could check out each other's settlements in 4 and run through raider/fiend camps together and then it was real!
---
I've played since the early beta days and put up with the worst that the game has been - even then I loved it. I have a few RL friends that come and go as content is added, plus the dozens that I've met playing and trading. 
---
Occasionally we will roll new characters with backstories and try different builds, usually I get to around level 100 and get bored of a build and start a new one. 
---
We honestly find the most random things to do, everything from running the borders of the map to setting each other loot challenges ( first to 10 or 20 or 50 of something). Survival was great because it limited fast travel so you ran everywhere and came across at least 5x more random spawn legendaries. I run a lot, the random events alone can be hilarious, you miss a lot of that fast traveling.
---
Playing real estate agent is fun, give each other a list of 3 things that you want in a camp site and see what we can find that's a little out of the ordinary. 
---
I rarely even looked at the daily and weekly challenges but still somehow manage to complete most of them just running around.
---
Don't get me wrong, I take breaks regularly. I think I went from last September until wastelanders came out without playing. Sometimes it's just as fun to delete a main character and start again, the are some really fun quests in the main story and I think wastelanders content will be enjoyable to replay, maybe just not the rep grind again though!
---
It is intentional
---
Flying teletubbies?
---
Some events only, apparently. 100 or so. 
---
But no killing or anything unless its a Daily or Weekly
---
It has a 'magic' effect, works well in VATS.
---
I'm level 357 and I still hate to see crickets coming.  Not as bad as molerats though.  If Appalachia needed a rectal exam, molerats are where they should begin the probe.
---
I SYNCRO SUMMON RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!!...
---
Sorry, don't know what came over me
---
agreed, i think they are seeing the xp rewards, i have yet to see any score direct from events
---
I enjoy the game, a lot. It may be a B- in quality but I certainly feel I get my monies worth. I'm still playing and still enjoying it. I dont have the NW skins because I didn't enjoy that game. I dont care I didn't get to unlock something cosmetic. Every companies goal is to make money. If you enjoy it, you really shouldn't feel bad to pay for it.
---
Ignore the haters, its fine. heres a detailed walkthrough:
---
1. approach terminal
---
2. select continue
---
3. select add ammo points
---
4. select ammo group
---
5. select specific ammo
---
6. (on xbox) tap A until ammo gone
---
7. select Buy ammo
---
8. select ammo group
---
9. select ammo type
---
10. (on xbox) tap A until points gone
---
11. blow stuff up
---
idk, maybe its just me, but like i said: 3 minutes, including figuring it out, and i end up with 20 mini nukes and all that ballistic stuff gone. win win.
---
I legit said this lol. I'm not a hater on the franchise by any means. I've played since the first one. I'm 500+ hours deep and saying I feel good about stepping away now.
---
Yea that seems the biggest takeaway for me.
---
What are u talking about. I’m not bitching on day one it can’t be done. As I said get 8 weeks in. If the majority, which I suspect will be, there or there abouts then it’s pitched right. If at 4 weeks it’s far to easy and if it’s 11 then it’s to hard. Then bitch about it.
---
I think you're playing the wrong game with that mentality, there's always NW for that if you still want the fallout aesthetic
---
These trailers are made weeks/months in advance. The footage for this one was definitely made before they decided to delay and change the legendary perks.
---
You can't use your mic in public teams??
---
Wouldn't it just be easier to play it instead of waiting
---
Ya the public teams are great, I leveled up 7 times yesterday from 123 to 130 with the huge xp boost from the events team(I also use egg head and meat stew). Also it seems like the events have more people at them now, I’m liking the additions in patch 20
---
Yea, I hope once we have more information, possibly after the weekly reset, there will be consensus from the community on what exactly the worst parts of the season are, and how they can be improved.
---
I've given up trying to form a stable opinion. There have been some amazing people over the years who compiled amazing lists, programs, databases, etc for this game, and then there are front page posts asking for emotes in the atom shop. Then we have the mandatory "did stealth get nerfed? is food going down faster? did legendary drops get nerfed?" after every single patch, or somebody getting disgruntled about a senseless non-issue, people getting upset over genuine issues, people getting upset about others getting upset. I still come here from time to time to keep up with news and perhaps for discussion, but I've long stopped taking anybody I see here seriously
---
Really??? Some people!!!!

The character has been mentioned in 3, NV, 4 and 76. He's a comic book character like Grognak. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Captain\_Cosmos](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Cosmos)
---
I thing there will be a event at the observatory like that?
---
I get that. People play games differently, I loved atom shop stuff, but I liked doing the challenges to get the points. It's all I've really been doing much of since wastelanders ended. I'm glad you're still enjoying! YOU paid for the game and I hope you continue enjoying it.
---
yes they fix erectban hacks
---
Eh, those can be bought. Just hop a few vendors - you’re bound to find a good one :)
---
i go to an event and start doing it. up to them to see where i am.
---
Making Public events giving SCORE and then adding a mid-pass SCORE multiplier (even just 1.1x!) would go a long way
---
Yes lets further normalize only ever being motivated to do a job right if we get paid extra.

Honestly with "magic weapons" working even on full health builds, the only real consideration is adjusting perks to accomodate XP boosting, and to include harvesting of cranberries, sugar, and gourd for Cranberry relish.
---
Well, that seems like a slight oversight on Bethesda's part.
---
Why would u use tenderiser?  What enemy that u attack is alive 5 seconds after the first shot?? I’ll run gun fu at 3 whilst adrenaline is broke. As for sandman. 50% of the time it’s a
---
100% damage increase. That’s pretty big. .
---
Thats hilarious
---
Indeed. You'd have to be some sort of Prophet or something.
---
I want my perks like follow through and the one for reduced ranged damage already. 😭
---
Sometimes its better to work a little overtime at work to save you hours in game.
---
I learned this with the Guild wars 2 legendary grind. I would rather work a full 8hr day to buy the legendary i want than spend dozens of hours, crafting materials, and gold to get the legendary.
---
This ammo converter is totally wrong!  
---
First thing the usability is awful, terrible, repeatable and unescalable, some players have more than 5 digits ammunition stashed which make easier to just go farm the ammo you wanted, which will keep those huge ammounts of unused ammo right where they are.  
---
The design omg, a HUGE "bench" if we can call it that and it's a godamm terminal attached to some producer, really? can't we just have a machine where we BREAK DOWN the components and then we craft it on the TINKER? such an unfitting ugly machine, I don't remember choosing the wacky wasteland perk when I walked outside of the vault...  
---
those two things triggers me the most, it's awful and it's ugly. make something smaller, some rustic, there are modders than do a better work than this.
---
I don't refuse to do it for no reason; I have mods on my install, so I just can't (game won't allow modded install to join NW).
---
I’m sure I will figure out something. I just don’t think players should have to do that, tis all. 
---
And there are several posts already that have done the mathematics behind how much score points you need and what that will give you, highlighting that even with completing all challenges it is not enough to reach level 100 on the game board. 
---
But of course we can always buy a level for the atoms that they no longer give us lol.
---
I have my doubts about it my friend. Look at how long it took them to fix the vending machine dupe glitch. It took almost two months to restore vending. *Vending machines took almost two months.* Do you really think they’re going to fix this glitch within a reasonable amount of time?
---
Maybe, but I have no interest in that. It's not enjoyable to me.
---
 I either sit there and read reddit and move when the zones move or crawl round pick up as much crap as I can and then hide.  I usually get in the top 10 every time.
---
Its hard enough to find full games as is, why split up the players?
---
Also not to mention one of the challenges was complete 5 events in a team
---
I only played it the first week it was out lol
---
Yep, am on PC and fiance would never let me bring that to the beach with us haha
---
DArn tootin', Beth might have slipped up on some things (looking at you ammo exchanger thingy ) but this... this is good. Makes me look forward to playing again
---
This is one of the exact bug they said they fixed............And then............When you do complete them and they grey out but you are still tracking it but never receive the points......... I did 8 of five on one after it was grayed out!
---
We tried teams last night, really enjoyed it. Only issue was forgot to set up my mic before launching the game and forming team (can only switch sound set up if I quit, do it, then restart the game) so had no communication but people still were great fun to play with and traveled from event to event with us.
---
That's entirely too much grind to ask for, though a double xp weekend would bring out the xp grinding groups easier. For me who only cares about the ammo machine and the very last power armor skins, I'll probably continuing to give the game a pass.
---
Yeah I played the 1st 2 matches when it came out and haven't touched it since. Now that there's score involved I'll at least bushwhack.
---
Except you don't have to stop playing solo, GTFO.
---
Spent all my game time yesterday being in "teams" but going my own way and completing events by my own. I did all two of my nuke launches by myself, and everyone just joined to fight the queen.
---
false. no matter what I do I'm still bound by the daily limitations set by Bethesda.
---
&gt;A fun game that is continuing to evolve and improve.
---
...at a snail's space. and breaking things at a 3:1 ratio to actual fixes.
---
Event award are questionable at this time. Some say yes, some say no. 
---
Level 98 to 99 will take you 3425 points and 99 will take you 3450 for a total 6876. 
---
You'll need to repeat that almost 70 times. 
---
Granted that's only once a day and should be more than doable. Provided you do everything every day including NW. 
---
If you don't do NW that is a reduction of almost 
---
3rd edit my math was way off.
---
If the NW dailies are as simple as "use three stimpaks" or "gain a level" like they have been these past two days then no, I think they can suck it up or forego the 250 Score
---
Each level takes more than the last.
---
I switched over to a tesla rifle. I just shoot at their feet and zap them all. Who needs to aim! Lol
---
Floaters most likely
---
You don't have to leave the team; you get continued bonuses being teamed up, and you don't have to be in your team's presence to get some bonuses (like Strange in Numbers).
---
nb: By "at the end of the day", I mean end of the game day when dailies/weeklies refresh (11 EST?)
---
i mean, they may not be difficult, but i physically cannot play every day and even if i could sometimes i just don't want to.
---
i know it's irrational because a lot of the stuff is cosmetic only and i came to terms with fomo a long time ago even before fallout 76 came out, it just sucks for collectors who want to get everything. miss a day? grind to make up for it. don't like nuclear winter? grind to make up for it.
---
it's great that they came up with a system that gets more people involved in doing challenges, incentives to join in and group up and do more public events, etc. i just feel like they could have made it less intensive.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
But they arnt new just redesigned
---
Yes, I know.
---
I’ve hit that moment as well. 
---
I desire content, not additional pushes and “rewards” that I will never use to repeat what I’ve been doing day in and day out. I think I’ll take the first step when I get home from work and cancel 1st so it doesn’t auto-renew. 
---
I love this game, but I’m done grinding and being held back.
---
From my understanding is once they hit below full health it just does whatever the standard damage your gun has listed and not double.so if it says your gun does 100 damage then it will do 200 to a full health enemy and 100 on anything not at 100% health. 
---
 An instigating handmade isn’t a bad gun but Definitely put a hardened receiver on a handmade unless your running full auto build. Its still great to pick off the lower level enemys or when you get really surrounded. The reload on hunting rifles and lever actions can get you killed in the wrong sistuation. 
---
Instigating handmade isn’t a bad fall back gun but definitely seek out a better rifle. its useful for areas like the forest since 5.56 ammo is easy to come by. However As a rifleman a lever action or a fixer is gonna be your main weapon. With a handmade as your fall back for when things hit the fan. 
---
If your on Pc i can craft you a max level fixer free of charge? It uses the same mods as the combat rifle so you won’t have to worry about scraping a bunch of fixers for mods.
---
At least i won 1 in that week lol
---
The funny thing is that you are more likely to be killed by anything else there than by the SBQ, no matter what level you are.  ;)   I just completely ignore her and focus on taking out ground-spawns until I see her land - if she's in the air my shots are worth squat.
---
I'd basically given up on the game before the season thing dropped. Logged on yesterday to see what it was about and played for a while.  I don't see it sustaining my interest.  This is not new content. It's a way to trick us into doing the same damn content we have been doing for more than a year.
---
I don't want to take a workshop just to build stairs and a door so I can earn score points. That is what I did yesterday.  That feels futile and just dumb.
---
Oh I know. Mutated tapeworms from the old fallout games
---
I know I just said left the team for those people who want the solo experience and don’t want to be on teams with people
---
Take a screen shot and submit a ticket to Bethesda.
---
Thank you! Very informative :)
---
The only reason I kept mine was to put three display boards on it, the top one clipping through it a really weird angle and the other two have in neon letters “FUCKING TRASH” 😂
---
Yup, frankly i like them, they can be difficult
---
That's true now, but it's also a new progression system introduced this season. Previous FN seasons have been more of a grind, capping off the amount of daily and weekly challenges you could do.
---
It'll take Beth some time to figure out how to do it right. Lord knows it took Epic long enough.
---
anywhere is possible to see all those rewards and how many xp we need to unlock them?
---
No problem. It’s going to be called steel dawn And it’s part 1 of 2 for the even bigger BOS questline in the winter.
---
Oh right. That makes things a little trickier. You would have to do them solo so it's a matter of looking through the list to see what is doable. The kill scorched ones are fairly simple but you have to do 76 with each weapon.
---
Nice!
---
Why's it an oversight? If someone makes the decision to go solo like you said, they can't exactly bitch about teams
---
You don’t need 5 hours every day. That’s absurd and doesn’t align with math at all. I played an hour last night and got 6 levels. There are people on level 20 already apparently. 
---
Also I don’t get your NW math. Isn’t the daily nw challenge 250 score? 250x70 is 17,500
---
For a nocturnal/bashing/aiming damage bs gun (got an auto grenade launcher today...) you should be allowed to shot the purveyor and fight some random legendary guard...
---
Public Events are supposed to grant SCORE points. Gaining XP for SCORE points is repeatable, and with the new XP buffs it’s even easier. Angry Turtle posted a video showing that he was easily getting 500XP per Super Mutants which means 20 SMs gets him 100 Score. 
---
It will be a bit of a grind, but far from ponderous. And not everyone will be willing or able to commit to the grind. And that’s perfectly okay. 
---
Not everyone needs to get everything.
---
To bad we didnt get everything in patch 20
---
I did a ton of events over the last two days and I didn't get ANY SCORE for the events itself.
---
Not for the SBQ fights (about twenty), not for Encryptid (5), not for any of the other publics.
---
The only SCORE I got during those was the 100 for getting yet another 10k XP.
---
So, yes, I too would like to see video evidence of those who claim they did get a 1000 or whatever for finishing ANY event.
---
Great guide. I have a similar route I follow for XP and general farming. The one thing I would add is National Satellite Radio Array is very much worth adding to the run. You can walk there from West Tek, it has no interior load cells and is full of high level super mutants, plus it has a ton of fans and phones for screws and circuits and often has a legendary or two. The best part is it can be cleared out in about 2 minutes if you know all the spawns.
---
Yea it really sucks. That’s why I don’t ever uninstall. (Granted I play regularly, but even then I wouldn’t uninstall). Got a 6TB hard drive so I don’t need to worry about storage.
---
I still don’t even know how to change my icon.  The UI is total trash.
---
I think it would be nice to have solo / duos but I just don’t think there are enough of us that play it consistently
---
Assuming you do all daily/weekly challenges, you need an average of 76 SCORE per day to reach L100 on the final day  
---
Given one of the daily challenges is likely to be "level up", it seems a given that completing the challenges will guarantee more than enough to reach L100 from challenges and exp alone, and any SCORE from events will be on top of that.
---
I know lol, i saved the video of the match lol
---
I hope season 2 is free. LoL
---
I’ll be dammed I am paying for it on top of the game and FO 1st and the fact that I have played everyday since beta, except for 10 days when my hubby and I moved 1300 miles from where we were and had to wait for he cable to be hooked up.
---
No I would go to the next event and do the “come on” emote
---
I know the scrapbox doesnt eork if subscription runs out
---
But I use a cryolator, and I still get rewards. Freeze her on the ground, switch to my .50 MG.
---
I can appreciate the game's need to bring in some revenue, but man, I'm really torn about this. It's like, "why can't I have both?" Like you earn a scrip for completing challenges and could turn it in for S.C.O.R.E. or atoms. Kinda like picking between a perk card or moving a stat point.
---
its under the picture of the power armor helmet in this interview
---
https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/
---
That's still an awfully big assumption. Until it's datamined, I'd suggest not complaining and just play. You're psyching yourself and a lot of others out of even giving it a chance.
---
Ok, so everything else is just fine?
---
I can try. I haven’t recorded a video before, though. If you move the mouse off the screen it remembers your  last input. I can certainly try to show though.
---
On ps4 its seems way smoother
---
You can if you own it, but it’s no longer free to do so, which has killed workshops for me.
---
220,275 points needed total by my calculations.... (98 × 99) ÷ 2 × 25 + (99 × 1000)
---
Math nitpickery aside though, this system is absolutely designed for us to fall short and spend money to cross the finish line.
---
Also, NW is awful. And it requires you to disable any mods to play which is understandable but also a pain in the butt. So that's an extra 17,500 points that I'd need to make up with atoms if I had any plans to grind it out.
---
Now that the newness of Wastelanders has worn off, I don't think this game can hold my interest for 10 weeks straight. Especially with the mandatory daily grind.
---
Mostly correct. You can’t add into it but you can still take out of it manually or automatically, and you can still place/move the box.
---
They just don't know what they are doing is all
---
So it still basically expects you to play every day or most days for 10 weeks?
---
That's fucking insane. It's not like their is any fun new content. It's doing the same shit people have been doing for god knows how long.
---
It's. I really don't like it. I don't like what Bethesda are doing. They are trying to get you exposed to the atom shop for as long as possible. In a horrible grind way. 
---
How can they expect people to do this and not be wildly burned out??
---
Not a chance will I. I know that.
---
Again, take it from someone who used to do the old daily challenges: this one's easier. I was done with the non-NW dailies in less than an hour; the weeklies took the rest of my time. 
---
In the old days, I would level up once after 5-6 hours of playing. Yesterday I leveled up three times. The only difference is where before I would endlessly grind West Tek, yesterday I did all of the faction events in between doing the public ones and going for nuke runs.
---
Sadly idk, i never let my subscription run out
---
Better stock up on toxic goo I guess
---
I won't be able to play for 2 weeks and was getting pretty worried I'd miss out on the end reward stuff. Hopefully I'll be able to make up for lost score with the repeatable weekly. Still though, it seems kinda weird that there wouldn't be a decent surplus of points for people who can't play everyday, y'know?
---
but that sexy gatling gun tho
---
and fireplace door
---
That's an unexpected question, though I don't find it dickish (we're on the internet after all, there's no awkwardness for me here lol).
---
I'm Canadian liberal, so solid left with socialist sensibilities. I also have some moderate leanings on certain topics and an anti-authority streak that often leads to pushing back against some liberal moralizing and positions I view as irrational. 
---
But it's largely ideological rather than political, as I rarely vote and don't involve myself in organized activism. I guess in the end my affiliation is toward empathy, good faith argument toward change, and unity of difference.
---
I agree that new stuff shouldn’t be added until the old stuff is fixed, but the ammo converter would have been such an easy thing to implement correctly. It’s just mind boggling to so many of us how badly they messed it up.
---
Sure they can. They have full right to. I would want to play solo, but not against full teams of four. It’s unfair to begin with; I’m destined to lose. And there are many people who like to play without teams. But Bethesda made an oversight in development and didn’t think to put a Solo option, meaning now people who like to play solo are either going to lose or be forced to join a team and cooperate.
---
Ok. Thanks. I know it's kinda worth it now that it has a yearly membership. Just got concerned if I'll loose any of those.
---
Im on PS4 and im not the only one on my friends list who is having this big lag spikes. It might be due to the influx of people coming back to the game but i dont really know.
---
That’s good to know and thanks for the info, as that will be helpful. I just hope that in the end we all get to a point we want lol.
---
Good list, but won't be the same for everyone, as weekly challenges are completed at a different rate.
---
I’m not complaining and it’s not a big far fetched assumption, if anything the only complaint is have is the time limit allotted with the score we get, it shouldn’t be too Grindy for an event with a timer
---
I have 300+ hours in the game and diseases never bothered me.They are laughable.I use an unarmed build so i also have plague walker which allows me to poison the enemies around me while carrying aids. Good for pulling mobs when legendary farming. SO I WILL HAVE FUN, THANKS.
---
Why does it look like I'm not getting S.C.O.R.E. points in Fallout 76?
---
We are investigating an issue where some Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 completed instead of 5 of 5 completed. In these cases, you are still getting your S.C.O.R.E., but you have already received it by the time you have actually completed the Challenge, so it will not display an updated score when you complete 5/5 on the Challenge. This will be resolved in a future update. 
---
Please note that sometimes the UI may take a few moments to update. 
---
If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points other than the above mentioned reasons, please submit a Feedback report here under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting.
---
From help.bethesda.net when you go to submit a ticket about challenges.
---
what are you talking about? ammo converter is amazing. and combat rifle skins finally apply to fixer.
---
You lose access to your tent and you can no longer add junk to the scrap box. But you keep your outfits and emotes
---
As a solo player... is this cause for return? I was getting bored doing things all alone.
---
What is the change? Essentially a group finder?
---
Done, wonder what they'll say. If anything.
---
But you don't need to leave a team to solo. I was "soloing" multiple events yesterday even though I was on "a team". You don't have to hang out with the people in your public team; I know I don't want to, so I didn't. I just did events, got the passive buffs for them being there, and I leveled up 3 times thanks to the team.
---
Yeah, I found where they all are, and right now I think I have over 50 different missions to do, most are only 20 and 40 atoms, but that should be enough. And if I work efficiently I should be able to get lots done in the 12 days and be able to buy pilot boi! Plus I do like those communist cosmetics, like the backpack but I only want the pilot for now
---
Weird, i hope u can figure it out
---
Having played RDR2 when it came to Game Pass, I'm wondering if we'll get a flood of griefers like they did. I'm thinking not, since they're very different games, but it still crossed my mind.
---
At any rate, more players bodes well overall for the community.
---
You get to keep all skins, emotes and icons you receive as part of first, you also get to keep the scrapbox, however you cannot put anymore scrap in it, only take out the scrap that is in there, any scrap you collect after that will have to be stored back in your stash.
---
Yeah people don’t seem to understand that concept. Too wrapped up in the “sole survivor” thing
---
Mine is gone too...
---
They want people on daily, that's what drives sales...that's how it's free. It doesn't take that long to hammer out challenges and get off for the day. And an assumption no matter how extreme, is still just an assumption.
---
People aren't getting SCORE?
---
Pacifist mode has to be turned off to engage pvp.
---
They can still.murder you but will get a bounty and you won't drop scrap.  
---
Trap kills don't trigger pvp, *will* cause you to drop your scrap and are border-line exploits imho.  People who do this are second-rate toolbags.
---
Mine is useless, especially in someone’s camp or a larger event... atm can’t even open my stashbox, took over 8 attempts to fast travel my camp... (100kg under limit) tried other games, all ok...checked the network etc, all good). 
---
Edit: i put a #thisiscrap sign on the ammo converter, should just scrap it...
---
Plus u get 10 dollers worth of atoms a month
---
Awesome. That sounds about right. Thanks.
---
How the hell is this getting upvotes? You’re completely and utterly wrong, this entire system is still bullshit. There’s a cap of 2000! What drugs were they taking to make them think that yet another cap is ok? It’s turning into a £60 mobile game.
---
If I’m understanding this correctly, I will hit 100 on the final day if I have no room for error?
---
So the part I'm trying to understand is how much you go that wasn't part of weekly / daily challenges.  It sounds like not very much at this point. Bethesda needs to correct this, quickly.  They said that BOTH XP and Public Events would help, not Public Events will sometimes result in a tiny amount of XP that will eventually when you do it thousands of time help you get a level or two.
---
but they wont get $$$ for fixing it. why bother
---
So basically your junks will overstock into the thousands haha.
---
Yeah you can hammer them out, I know that, the problem is the time they gave us
---
We're still doing these dumbass "I'm leaving" posts?
---
I've seen a lot of folks mention that. I'm hoping to see a consensus thread soon to give Bethesda some suggestions to improve this part of the seasons.
---
This is all fine but have you tried this with a METRIC TON of ammo?
---
Thanks to Bandolier and Batteries included, all my ballistic and energy ammo does add up to roughly 100000 bullets/cartridges/cells. Subtract about 50k for the .50 and the 5mm I need for my everyday weapons and you are still left with 50k spare ammo.
---
This takes ages. It's certainly a nice to have thing if they ever improve upon it but as it is now it's just not in any way a reasonable thing to get rid of excess ammo.
---
I love Public Teams, though, so there is that. :)
---
fixer skins. none
---
Thanks for the tips dude!
---
As Deacon would say: "This is MY pile of garbage, asshole, back off"
---
leave the holy land
---
It looks like a recurve bow, although the way the bowstring is attached to pullies this suggests a compound bow.  So it's like a weird hybrid, and chances are it would blow up in your face
---
the same. a bit more damage and stats
---
Yeah. What I've read recently is after collecting a lot of junk and stored into your infinite box, itll be put back into your stash box. Haha
---
I don’t think 76 is gonna get the GTAO treatment and get upgraded. Most likely the game will be backwards compatible and you can play it directly on the next gen console
---
As I said, for the sake of simplicity, this assumes all weeklies are completed on the day they come out.  If you have't done them, it's easy enough to see how much exp they give, how much exp for your next level, and work out where you'll be when you finish them.
---
Because it's not really new content.  It's a repackaging of existing content, which is pretty long-in-the-tooth after being left unchanged for almost two years.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't wound up so tightly, with zero margin for error and brutal toward anyone who can't afford to play the game every single day.
---
They've broken some perks made the precious ammo converter a mess to use reintroduced some bugs they've fixed in previous patches nw is giving all previous event rewards the score system is not working right where your either not getting score or getting em done early that's just to name a few
---
Yesssss it’s killing me right now. I’d almost trade all the new content for a fix!
---
&gt; I'm not interested in playing anymore due to the FOMO.
---
Yep, im an old school PC/console player, i got addicted to a mobile game for a while and the FOMO in everything made me go crazy about playing games, i ditched it of course.
---
I dont recommend anyone to force him/herself to play due FOMO, takes away the fun of video games even after you change games.
---
Well most of the challenges aren't things that would burn a person out so far. I haven't even been specifically trying to do them and am getting score. 
---
But yea, if you want 100% completion you need to be on daily. Which does seem inflexible.
---
Yeah. Atom points are the biggest things for decorations.
---
When I ask them not to and instead they share a higher rank I leave and show them why I run Bloodied. It’s one thing just saying no and telling me to piss of if I don’t like it. But sharing a higher level of that perk so as to fuck with my rads therefore build is so plain disrespectful I will show them why I run Bloodied and turn them into an ash pile.
---
Oh no that’s not a thing lol it all stays in your scrap box and you can take it out anytime you want - you just can’t put more back in. It’s definitely worth at least a month in that regard to get the emotes and outfit and to store as much junk as you can
---
Believe me I get it. The best generator skin they released was the stackable vault tec generators, but it only gives 3 power so it's basically a no go if you are trying to stretch camp budget.
---
My builds can get pretty in depth, I use interior walls and doors, a lot of decorations to fill empty space bot I side and out, different sorts of lighting including neons. So that budget drop hurts when using anything other than the fusion generator.
---
I do wish they let people have extended building points then that'll be worth a lot.
---
And that’s the point. Bye bye free daily and weekly atoms, hello limited quantities in slow amounts
---
Oh I know, I’m really jonesing for some new events. Even a little temporary event like Fasnacht would have been cool
---
Very true. They take a little getting used to, and are tougher than their appearance would make you think. 
---
But yes, contrary to what OP seems to think, this isn’t a creature that’s unique to Appalachia or even created by Bethesda. They were in the first two games, and designed by Interplay’s Jason Anderson.
---
It’s always amusing when someone just assumes that Bethesda ‘made something up’, lol.
---
I keep reading these posts and want to say that I did get score from free range yesterday, but I’m sure I’ll get discredited if I said anything without proof. It was the first event I did yesterday and the first score related pop up I saw so I remember it. It said “complete an event - 1000 score” or something like that. I figured it was just one of the challenges but it was all so new that I didn’t think anything of it
---
No worries at all, which system do you play on? I'm on PS4 my PSN is the same as my Reddit handle. Hopefully one day we'll have cross play as well!
---
I mostly use less powerful weapons in events and notch up when the team struggles.
---
It sounds like we’re in agreement, I just wish the sub was as flooded with complaints about the state of the game &amp; monetization &amp; empty promises as it is about this. It’s just the latest source of outrage and fixing it does almost nothing to fix the game as a whole. Keep in mind, people have been requesting ammo conversion since day 1. 
---
Yes, having it released in such a user-unfriendly state is disappointing, but that alone isn’t making or breaking this game. 
---
We didn’t ask for this dumb season pass- we asked to get rid of stupid challenges like “take a photo of a naked player in a rad zone”. 
---
They’re the ultimate victim-blamers saying “you asked for this so we gave it to you”. They could release perk load outs tomorrow but require you get an anal probe in order to use them and people would still defend the practice here.
---
Ok that make sense. Haha.
---
Speaking of that, when does that usually hit?  I got June's, but that was when I subscribed.  Is it on the monthly anniversary of your subscription date?
---
Okay, grumpy boy.
---
It’s not a cap on the day, it’s just a cap to then make your ammo then it goes back down. Maybe people are as big of a cry baby as you.
---
Then press back back back back back back back back back back back oops one to many exit pipboy
---
You're right. I multiplied it against 100 levels when it should be 70 days.
---
I dunno man. It could get ludicrously tedious of 10 weeks of scrap things for aluminium etc.
---
Hardly reviting gameplay.
---
I know but my screen on the right side where missions are, it is filled all the way to the bottom and keeps going because I just found the challenges to get atoms, I have so many now
---
More of a "dumbass farewell" post. Sooooo....yeah kinda
---
So, just because I actually tried it and nuked her myself. I checked and made sure all my challenges were complete, made sure to just complete and therefore reset the 10k xp repeatable one to not trigger it when killing her.
---
And lo and behold, I actually got some SCORE! Can't confirm how much as apparently it didn't screenshot when I pressed it and I forgot the number (I have terrible memory), but it was enough to get me up one level and a bit into it so 1k isn't unplausible.
---
Last night when I was playing all the workstations no longer had special claimed icons, were workshops removed/altered?
---
Exactly that. This is the failure line, not a target to aim for.   
---
If you slip behind it at any point, you need to put in extra work to catch up if you want to make L100 without paying ATOMS.  Obviously being well ahead of this is preferable
---
Sounds like you got your money's worth if you ask me
---
Some people will sub for a month and spend that month just loading their scrap box up with as much of everything as possible, if you do it right you could get away with only subbing for a few months a year, assuming you don't miss the tent.
---
I would really love to them make a concerted effort to bring this world back to life, much like they did with Wastelanders.  Keep bringing in new quests, new NPCs, new locations and stories.  That's why I'm still sticking around for the fall and winter updates, because hopefully they'll be bringing some of that.
---
Exactly what Bass said. Haha. Wishful thinking.
---
Did you want it to be a 1:1 conversion?
---
I'm happy. Gonna try get my friends into it
---
Yes.
---
I believe so
---
I have "small letters" plan in my vendor currently for 350 caps. I know it's probably worth more but I always sell them for that when i get them. 
---
XBox GT: TheNutrixx
---
Well two mainstream BRs, Fortnite and Apex Legends both can be completed quickly (3Wks) at the beginning of the season and at the last week or two of the season.  
---
This is because weekly challenges persist after each week and offer a way for new players to catch up near the end of the season.  Also the leveling up isn’t bordering egregious in those games. And news ways to gain exp/points for the BPs are always being introduced to keep players invested and having fun. Fallout 76 is boring and that hasn’t changed that way since launch.
---
It's funny, because most people I've seen have posted your number. I got 223,725 or something like that and rounded down because I was the only one at the time who had that number, and felt yours could be more accurate. And then about an hour ago another poster here said he got the same number as me, so I'm not sure what we're doing differently but given how small the difference is, I hadn't given it much thought. xD
---
Now I'm curious though... I'm not great with simplified math, so I did it the long way:

There are some challenges where you can scrap/craft weapons, clothes, etc that gets you a lot of caps easily. I've been going to places with a lot of low level enemies and just scrapping all the weapons/armor pieces they drop. Morgantown airport is great for that.
---
Say i missed out on those fugly christmas clothes, could i unlock those now
---
its all good i was going to move and redesign my base anyway.
---
I wouldn’t mind if the 2000 let us buy a reasonable amount of ammunition but when I’m in a serious fight, do you know how long the 240 fusion cells I can buy will last me? No? Well I’ll tell you - less than 5 seconds. And since you can just sell more ammo to get that back up to 2000 why is there even a cap in the first place? And what’s with all the menu crap?
---
So it can be fixed. I just spent the last hour fixing my friends. You can attach the stairwells to floating points like stairs, stair pillars to attach others at a higher or lower altitude. The goal is to get a different direct route into the ground. So stairs to the ground when that’s the issue. 
---
When it’s walls you need to attach more walls and make sure that they are connected and supported at another point. Once that entire section could be supported from a different angle, you should be able to delete the walls again
---
I know that’s a bit of a jumble of words so I’ll try to simplify. When something can’t be deleted because “structure” you need to connect onto it and create another anchor point.
---
Game Pass is a place for games that would otherwise not even be considered or bought by players to try out. I don’t think this game gets much new purchases so this will increase the player base maybe. I think they should just make the game f2p.
---
Just to put this in perspective: VATS is a ***core gameplay feature*** of Fallout 76, and it's been basically borked for months without a fix in sight.
---
Can you imagine the stink if aiming down sights were left broken for months in Call of Duty? Or if stealth didn't work in Assassin's Creed? Or if mounts suddenly stopped working correctly in World of Warcraft and Blizzard just didn't do shit to address that bug? 
---
And this is just ***ONE*** of a number of core features that are flat out broken in this game. Hello energy weapon damage!
---
***WHY*** are people just letting Bethesda get away with this? Why are people ***STILL*** making excuses for this shit? Stop playing this broken, poorly managed game until they commit to fixing their tech debt.
---
"...No time to wallow in the Mire..."
---
You dont need the 1% perfect build.
---
Egghead is worth having anyway  - the increase in XP ofsets the (minor) negative.
---
Since you can now pretty much guarantee being in a team (public teams) you can run herd mentality (+2 to all stats)
---
Again, since you can easily join a group you can slot the strange in numbers perk. This buffs both egghead and herdmentality.
---
If you join/make a "building" public team you'll get between +1 to +4 INT depending how many people are in it.
---
Since you can now always be in a team, you can slot inspirational (+15% xp)
---
You get +5% from canned meat stew. Not hard to do feed the people.
---
You get well rested bonus from sleeping in a bed.
---
You dont need a full bloodied unyielding build with specific under armours, you get plenty from some common mutations and a bit of common sense.
---
The main pain is that you want to be logging in every day to do the dailys, the XP is actually fairly easy (did it 11 times in 4 hrs split over 2 days - and that was a bit of gaming time in the evening, and while the kids ate their dinner)
---
It was a pain in the royal buttocks to use the Ammo Converter. I tried and converted several hundreds of ammo. I filled up the 2000 points twice and converted the ammo. I think I have 10 points remaining. It took a long time. I'll probably use it going forward, as I have thousands of ammo sitting in my store that rarely ever get purchased (Maybe once a week someone will buy a few thousand 5mm or Shotgun Shells).
---
It definitely could be made more intuitive. Why do I need to hit Continue on the first screen. I'm obviously using the device for the purpose of Converting Ammo. After the first acknowledgment it should default to selecting Convert or Purchase.
---
Secondly, it should simply give each type a value and allow you to select however many you want, up to the 2000 (though that limit seems ridiculously low). And then do the conversion. Additionally on the Purchase screen, you should just be able to do the same. Select the Ammo type you'd like and add as much as is allowable within the 2000 limit.
---
However, I agree with many of the posts that state this was done INTENTIONALLY. They don't want to make getting rid of "useless to you" ammo. They want everyone to utilize the market and create stores selling ammo to each other.
---
I'm not gonna lie, I will smile if I unlock the Ultracite PA skin - as it's really shiny, and I like shiny.
---
Except for those made by companies under the Xbox Game Studios brand. Those come out day one, and stay on permanently, kind of like Netflix Originals do on that platform.
---
Other games tend to stick around a while, too, though. The Witcher 3 has been on since last fall, and ESO has been on since 2018, just for a few examples.
---
If a game is leaving, you get a 20% discount to buy it permanently, so it's not a bad deal.
---
They’ve usually been very responsive when it was Atoms. No reason to believe this would be any different. 
---
The auto-complete issue happened to me last week, and I got the 70 Atoms the next day.
---
I figured as much. I appreciate the serious response, rather than the downvotes I’ve received lol.
---
Good on you, though. I was honestly just curious
---
He’s been in Fallout. And the floaters have been in Fallout since the first game. Just because you don’t know anything about doesn’t mean “Badthesda” is just adding stuff with no explanation.
---
No, we already got a 500 atom apology...
---
It still get stuck in a charging state if you fire it rapidly simple fix is to holster it then pull it out
---
Well, an even simpler UI would be to make ammo scrap-able like everything else. We can scrap everything else, why the arbitrary restriction on ammo? Hell, if you can get cloth for prewar money, why not from notes?  Plastic from holotapes?  Everything should be scrapable.
---
TIHI math vs math
---
Lol this made my day, I ran away from my fair share of crickets before I got my build set up properly. Those mf are relentless
---
The IDEA of an ammo converter is great, what we got was tragic, i used 1000s of rounds of unused ammo and got around 200 .45 rounds.  Excess ammo will be going back in the vendor to get caps to buy ammo/lead/steel, before i use that crap again
---
Yeah a bit too many level up based challenges already!
---
Bingo bango bongo I dont want to leave the jungle
---
Yes! This has totally killed off the last of the merits to having a workshop for me. I made a post about my biggest gripes with Patch 20, made a new friend from it at the cost of karma 😂
---
I do the same once I've got my damage in, take out the spawns, especially if they're going after lower level players.
---
*Turns on Atom Bomb Baby* Search and Destroy Communism, Got It.
---
I’m on pc :(
---
There's too many damn bugs that got introduced that makes patch 20 not worth it at the moment. Browse the fallout 76 subs and you'll see the countless reports of bugs
---
Absolutely my point! I definitely did and I had a great time doing it. Glad for my time here. Happy to leave before I start hating it.
---
If you use the emotes they actually pop up next to your party icon on the other team members screens, so as mentioned if you do a follow me it might prompt then to fast travel to you and join in.
---
What level are you on the board and what is your current amount in that bar? Now how much of the daily and weekly score shows it is completed? Add that total, and if it matches the level then it simply completed at 3/5 like most people are reporting. If it doesn’t, you’re out of luck
---
Levels 1-5 are

---

---
That's awesome!
---
Dude, this is like 5 times as convoluted as the Ammo press in Fallout 3 which was just dump ammo in bin and hit a convert all to X thing on a terminal then collect. It's just completely tedious and slow as hell to go through multiple terminal screens just to break down a stack of ammo bit by bit, then go through those screens AGAIN to make the ammo you want bit by tiny bit.
---
You can play like any game with crafting and they do it better than this shitshow. Hell other systems in 76 itself do it better.
---
Best belive if they do release more gameplay content I would give it another shot! I just dont wanna hate something I once loved so much.
---
Yeah, which sucks cus that's how I usually use it half the time.
---
If you use the FO76 Mod Manager it has a button for Nuclear Winter mode where it disables all your mods (you simply disable Nuclear Winter mode and every mod will be renabled). Just trying to help in case you were unaware!
---
Yeah. It should be your month (30 days) tops on day one whe you subscribe
---
I see what you did there xD
---
You're wrong, plenty of new people came in when the steam sale started, and still are. I've seen maps just filled with low level players.
---
Yep, basically to get ppl to buy not earn the atoms. This is the typical mmo model.
---
I believe they delayed the quest.
---
Stupid Crap Only Received Excruciatingly
---
I wish I could give the ammo converter back.
---
Actually you get the score when you complete 3 out of 5 of the challenge. Idk why it’s doing that but I got my 1000 points for building 10 stairs, 10 crops, and 20 lights but when I finished the the other two building options nothing happened. We were talking about this on some other post, just watch for when you complete 3/5 and you’ll get the points
---
Hard agree. It's like a bad mobile game at this point.
---
I resent the Austin team getting to do this project
---
Idk why I like it at all, I know I shouldn't
---
I aint got time to make my self to login every single day for 10 weeks lol, shame the patch content is clearly monetization and nothing else.
---
100% agree.  I feel like more people should have a problem with the content this year because all of it so far seems to fall to tedium.
---
COMMUNIST TARGET ACQUIRED!
---
I didn't notice until halfway through an event after joining. I had to run down to a river and start chugging, lol.
---
Can it be worn under the Chinese Stealth Armor?
---
Ten weeks? Like every other season pass ever? Everyone seems to get those done just fine
---
It's just another bug that they've ignored yet again
---
No way for anyone here to know.  It's only at level 5 though so you could probably nab it pretty quickly
---
That will be 50 atoms please
---
Of course not. They might even be fine for some ammo types, but the UI is absolutely terrible and the time it takes to turn in and receive what you want is absurd. 
---
It might be a good thing for your daily loot but if you are one of those people who, thanks to Bandolier and Batteries Included, never threw away any ammo this machine is either completely useless or something you might use on a rainy week with nothing else to do. Like, literally nothing else to do.
---
I have been having much better luck lately. I have three characters above 50 and I will build all three up to 1000 then go purchase all the picks back to back. I usually end up with 2-3 good draws and one top tier draw each round. 
---
Last time I got a AA/25/25 radium, FE Fixer, Stalker Fixer, and a few other nice items. To me, going in with a lot of script to spend makes the crap draws seem less painful. 
---
Here's to your luck improving!
---
bruh, it was in the trailer and everything
---
Apparnelty its bugged. It doesnt work if you scrap at scrapboxes but works from workbenches
---
How do you know what perks you are sharing?
---
I think what its trying to say is that dailies and weeklies will include stuff such as public events. Look at the context between sentences. The first sentence only talks about dailies and weeklies. The second sentence further elaborates on what a daily or weekly is.
---
This should have been F2P, you probably didn’t get your money’s worth.
---
I preordered and still wish I had that 60$ for something worth it
---
Wastelanders was good until you get to the play loops at the end.
---
Just my opinion but those (rep, gold) are bad enough to soil the whole update, as good as the npcs were
---
Is score character or account specific? Leveling up from 104 to 174 (a level a day for 10 weeks) will be a lot of playing. Could I potentially start a new character for the level up challenge?
---
Meh, it reassured me. According to some other post I saw, unless you leveled up 100 times, you’d have to pay your way to level 100.
---
Much more clarity and in depth than my mini post earlier. touche and spot on!
---
I see.
---
Doesn't that raise another issue that the season pass isn't rewarding for players who complete it quickly though? After three weeks, doesn't that make players feel like they're wasting their time a bit playing and getting no rewards, and instead turn the game off until the beginning of a new season?
---
I think that you would probably end up seeing complaints in this sub if that was the case in this game - players who invest their time levelling quickly (as has been the case since Wastelanders with the rep grind) will have nothing to do after a month and therefore just stop playing altogether. Personally I would prefer the season pass to always be active rather than finish it and feel like I'm wasting my time playing and not getting the same rewards the whole time.
---

 I'm on Xbox
---
I’m referring to the Xbox audience
---
Yeah mine stopped because of an issue with my card.  While it stopped i could still place scrapboxes, take items out of it, but couldn't put anything in.
---
If you cancel you're missing out on using your Survival Tent, lose the ability to add to scrap, and you don't get the 1,650 atoms each month.  That's it.  Everything else obtained is still usable, you can still craft Ranger Armour, use emotes etc.
---
The queen is tough especially for bloodied builds you’re bound to die a couple of times. 260 damage per headshot seems a bit light for a bloodied build tbh. The main perks you need all maxed commandos and tank killer, bloody mess nerd rage, covert operative and mister sandman all maxed. As far as what else you should be running to maximize damage, small guns bobble head, ballistic bock, and psychotats. Chems do not stack very well in this game but ballistic bock stacks with any chem, psychotats is best for damage, with those buffs you should hit for over 500 in the head during daylight and more at night.
---
During the PTS they discovered areas that could use improving and tweaking so it was delayed, just like the legendary perks. Shouldnt be for to long though.
---
DM me and we can get that set up
---
If they have a yellow card with a number in it next to their name that means they are sharing a perk. When you look at your perk cards you will see any shared perks pinned over yours
---
I may have misunderstood but I read that they delayed it again.
---
That’s what I’m doing. I refuse to give up the fun I have playing the game just to make sure I get a cool pip boy skin or shotgun skin etc. I grinded for a couple hours yesterday, got the rank after ammo converter and said fuck this shit. If I get some SCORE just randomly playing okay cool I get some stuff, but I am not grinding  this board game just for a few skins. If you are at end game, then sadly there just isn’t much to do. No point in forcing yourself to keep playing just so you don’t feel bad about giving it up. Minus the gold grind and now this score grind I still think the game is loads of fun if you detach yourself from those mind numbing grinds. I got what I wanted from the gold grind in less than a month. I haven’t done a daily in a week or so. I understand some people want more and aren’t satisfied until they have everything, but...that’s on you.
---
If you took your tadpole archery test you would know that answer.

PS4 mines crazy677hobby .cool
---
I had the exact same problem, I just use it all up. Back in the early days I used to have to dedicate hours to farming lead and steel to keep my be25 handmade spraying, now I have a selection of guns so if I'm low on something I just use something else for a while.
---
Also you can just throw it on the ground...
---
People believing in  and spreading misinformation surprises you? 
---
Whew! The invincible, transdimensional, space dwelling vampires sure have been using their balls on you! 
---
Personally, I've moved faster in game, Rank 13 currently, than the "numbers" have suggested I should have.
---
I've been saying this since the bulked junk weight spreadsheet started being spread.
---
Someone's numbers are funky.
---
Regarding bulked junk weight.
---
I started bulking junk not long after release to sell to vendors and clear stash space. No matter what junk I bulked, more stash space opened than just the weight of the plastic.
---
Yeah, anecdotal, but it's what was happening.
---
Thank Todd for 1st!
---
I'm thinking the numbers are somehow off on BGS, I have multiple recordings of the game engine not being able to factor 10% correctly when the vending machines were released.
---
Also, recently, I was helping a new player, like level 11, and our fast travel costs were WAY different. Theirs was about half of mine, even with Travel Agent on.
---
Indeed!
---
My understanding is that it's account-wide, but I haven't physically tested it yet. I think it would be getting way more pushback if it was character-specific, haha.
---
Okay, thank you. :)
---
In my opinion I don't really think it's that bad it's bad for all of us now because we're all sitting on thousands of rounds of ammo that we couldn't sell because those bullets aren't used except for level 10 and under so we're all converting thousands of ammo at small increments at a time however once you get through all of that you're then only dealing with a couple hundred as opposed to multiple thousands that's what it's designed for that when you go out there and you get 75 rounds of 38 caliber it's only for 5 minutes to convert it into the points
---
Not wrong, how you progress in something that doesn't for fuks sake. Events are broken after the patch good luck progressing.
---
vampiric minigun with +50% limb damage and accelerated barrel  is my current dream weapon.
---
Are you having fun? Sounds like no, so why not bugger off and play another game?
---
I'm having fun. Does the game have problems? Yeah, but a rant like this isn't going to fix them.
---
Yeah! I really like this picture! I actually noticed its feet first when I was looking for stuff in the grove. xD
---
imagine simping for a multi billionaire company
---
I still remember "This is not p2w, you get your atoms for free in the game. No need to buy them"...
---
Do you need dirty water? I know of one in toxic valley but.... Ya rare for sure
---
ah okay okay thank you 🙏
---
Ya it is. Isn't it funny?
---
Have you done the new wastlanders main quest?
---
Yes it's true! Shielded gives 15/15/15 resistance and 4S/2P/4E
---
They can be bought with gold from regs (vault 94 vendor)
---
The game is a giant chore list, its the game design.
---
&gt; And we know this game is no stranger to misinformation among all the  valid criticisms-- just yesterday I was in a discord where some person  posted three flagrant lies about this new system in an attempt to bash  Bethesda, things that could have been fact-checked in 5 minutes. I  posted several corrections and had a moderator of this discord tell me  that big corporations don't need defenders-- that was their response,  not saying hey, truth is better than falsehoods, but implicitly  criticizing me for saying anything that could be viewed as defense of  Bethesda. 
---
Yea people really have their head up their ass some times.  What they really mean is "Stop disagreeing with my opinion. It is mine so it is law and you can't disagree with it."
---
?
---
Are you suggesting an alternative solution or just trying to denigrate mine?
---
As of July 1 it's still not fixed :(
---
I think the idea is that you'd just do it naturally. If I play an hour session of basic gameplay loop (explore-scavenge-kill), I'm likely to come back home and end up scrapping 10 aluminum without trying. Most of the new challenges seem like that.
---
But I also have issues with the basic gameplay at this point. I wish they would have implemented a true PVE hardmode, that would get me way more invested in this kind of system.
---
Just to add in my two cents, I had also done the maths out of curiosity, and was originally a little disheartened that you could only get to level 80 something by doing just the challenges minus NW ones (As I have no interest in that mode). Turns out, I had done the calculations wrong after reading your post so thanks for pointing that out.
---
For those curious, I estimate that you will earn enough score to be around level 92 in the run if you complete all the daily/weekly challenges sans NW based ones, possibly a little higher as you are going to complete that 100 for 10k exp one passively by doing the others as it is.
---
I’ve already seen people switch to just covering the entire floor in front of their vending machine with punji
---
A send a request soon.
---
Where my camp is I so rarely ever get attacked by anything, it's nice! But a lot of spots it's a huge pain
---
Mine was fine until yesterdays update too. I'm using a combat shotgun
---
Finally
---
The people completing it the fastest in those games are the ones investing the most time and effort into it.  
---
In those games you are rewarded for playtime on top of challenges.  Challenges are just an occasional boost to the more casual audience later on.  
---
Many people still don’t complete the pass by the end, but the ones who care enough to commit do in the end and the people who try hard enough can finish it faster. It’s how it should work tbh.
---
That has nothing to do with what i asked but ok
---
That’s true haha, thanks for the correct math!
---
It's a tense time for political conversation I suppose, especially in the US. :/
---
That wasnt a patch 20 trailer. It was a summer content trailer. Colossal problem and legendary perks will be coming later in the summer with either a patch 21 or 20.5. probably end of july/early august.
---
LOL when I was playing yesterday there was this Brit -- sounded like an older gentleman -- who was complaining every five seconds. I think some people are just natural curmudgeons.
---
“All future updates will be free and all micro transactions with be cosmetic only”
---
“Explosive energy weapons will be readded at a later date”
---
“It just works”
---
There is no way. My guess is they will have a different skined one for each season.
---
Here’s a tip for the Atom Shop. If you’re short on Atoms and/or are not able/willing to buy Atoms, save them up over time and wait for the item/bundle to rotate back into the shop, and usually it will be discounted.  Sometimes up to 50% (although I think I’ve seen a few low cost items at 95%, like some Icons). 
---
Even with a lot of Atoms stocked up, for most things I will eat for a sale. I usually limit myself to one ‘brand new full price’ Atom Shop purchase a month.
---
Omg I've been doing that for a bit. Scrapping mostly shotguns which I'm surprised scores had carry so many of them. I scrap any weapons I can but do I get caps for that?
---
just hop on and do the weeklies. you'll nab it easily
---
The good thing is you only need about 4300 SCORE to get it, which is two full days of dailies or about half of the weeklies for one week, and it'll be running until September. Basically you'll only need the motivation to play the game for one or two days in the next month and you'll probably get it.
---
Yes that's why I did my own math haha. Was wrong with an off by one but it is possible. My only complaint is the NW challenge I'm going to have a hard time doing. I should have tried the stimpack one that seemed easy. I only want to get to 82 rank so I'm going to be ok.
---
I'm ahead of the curve so far. 4 weekly lvl completed casually. I bet I could double that with focus bit the gold bullion would suffer a bit.
---
Well Bethesda is a corporation they have a right to sell a product and make money.

I have fallout 1st and the reason I like it is because I enjoy playing on a private server. I don't really care about all the other bells and whistles. I wanted the private server , I love the tent and I love the scrap box, and for me it's absolutely worth it. I've seen juiceheads video about this and while I like him, I just don't think this that big a deal.
---
There is zero chance it takes anyone more than an hour to complete the dailys, if that’s all you are focused on.
---
Is there a lead spot there also? If so, where would the spot be?
---
I normally don't do nuke runs unless I really, really, _REALLY_ need the flux, but yesterday I was "fuck it, let's nuke". Twice.
---
Fuck the ammo converter. the Raider ammo manufacturer is the way to go bayyyybeeeee
---
agree totally. I admit I'm still trying to get the ally for settlers so I can see what all the fuss is about with the Gauss shotgun, but other than that, I try to play as organically as possible.
---
I still (lvl 140) enjoy the game a lot...but only if I play my way.
---
Damn
---
Ah ok, I'll try it. Thanks. Also, do you think this new July 4th stuff will go down in price as the sale goes on? Because it's like 12 days left and I just want the one item, so idk if it'll go down in price
---
Honest question: would it be beneficial to run a low level alt for the XP gains?
---
Maybe make vid since "jerky" doesnt really explain the problem and also try geforce experience
---
Public Events are supposed to give SCORE. We’re waiting for Bethesda to fix the issue or provide clarification. 
---
And 10k XP isn’t as challenging as you might think. Check out Angry Turtle’s video where he’s getting 500XP per Super Mutant kill. That’s 20 SMs to earn 100 SCORE, or about 5 SCORE per SM kill.
---
Dude, you should have way more subscribers lol
---
I don’t know how many others games you’ve played with battle/season passes, but RDO has a very short battle pass. (Measuring in time it takes to complete)
---
Modern warfare’s pass doesn’t take quite as much time as this, but it still takes a dedicated player to reach 100. 
---
Reaching tier 100 in Fortnite took completing every challenge they gave you, plus playing many extra matches.
---
Battlefield V doesn’t have a pass per se, but what it does have takes many matches to reach the end of and those matches aren’t short.
---
My point is that reaching the end of a battle pass isn’t supposed to be something everyone achieves, it’s a bragging right for dedicated players.
---
I gotchoo. Im on ps4. Its up by crater. Use resource map. About 1000 in game yards south of crater.
---
If you dont find it ill be on later. Whats your gt
---
IIRC a lot of those are already discounted?  Usually if it’s currently discounted it won’t get another or lower discount for a while.
---
Yeah, this is such a lovely mechanic. I rarely teamed up before but since this update dropped I've never not been a group leader or in a group.
---
What I would like to see added is a "Tour Guide" or "Bodyguard" group. I did show a couple of low levels half the map and made sure they got to level up, take all the loot and generally have a good time with me stepping in when something big and scary came along. :)
---
Handed out Treasure Hunter outfits and some meds/ammo as parting gifts and felt as if this was the real endgame content. High levels helping the little ones. I loved it and it made me hate Bethesda less for breaking Adrenalin and all the dumb design decisions ( CAPS ON EVERYTHING, HURR!). :D
---
Hey now, it will sit there AND take up a shitload of budget. Let’s not be harsh
---
Yeah. probs just cos everyone s flooding back to the game.
---
I was thinking of starting a new character for the season, so I'm down if you want to add me. CpT\_DiSNeYLaND
---
Haha same here
---
Nothing gives score outside of the daily an weekly challenges. Only repeatable one is get 10k xp.
---
Take advantage of the 4x xp for completing events by starting a public group. People will join you an it takes like 10mins to get to 4x xp with 4 people who joined at the same time.
---
Outside of vault steel and modules she is pretty worthless. You’re better off dropping scrip in a fire than getting anything worth the time it took you to get it.
---
Thank you fir the tip (;
---
I dont really know exactly what he does but its something around QA.
---
This is the reason for the misinformation imo because its not about putting together a solid evidence based proposal and submitting it to the devs. If it was we would have serious changes already as people have done that as far back as 2018 (really well done breakdowns with evidence and suggestions) and it falls on deaf ears because its clear the development team has their own priorities and scheduling. 
---
That being said I appreciate your commitment to the truth.
---
LMAO i never saw it but i must've seen commercials for it 10000 times when it was out.. Maybe i need to watch it LOL
---
No problem! They only cost 250 gold if i remember correctly
---
so at step 6 you can spam the A button? you don't have to go back a menu or two after every input (that's what other posts make it sound like)?
---
I suspect a lower level character would gain XP slower, but that's just a guess on my part. 
---
Based on what I've seen others mention, this game has a lot of ways to buff XP. My sense is that, if you want to speed up progression as the biggest priority, you'd want to get as many of those buffs as possible, jump on your gnarliest most OP character, and go to town on the locals. xD
---
You should it stars Josh Hutcherson before he become know as the beta from hunger games
---
I have 3 Charisma, but I don’t have any one star perks. So I won’t share anything because I can’t.
---
Indirectly lately, I buy my legendary modules, craft the weapon and then I get screwed. Been trying to get a bloodied plasma caster, got one today, 1*
---
I joined a team and someone was sharing photosynthesis and another was sharing rad sponge. I lost 200 rads every few seconds and was constantly gain health back
---
Why just the gauss shotgun and USSS jetpack, though?
---
No one asked for this crap. We asked to not have to do dumb shit like “take a picture of a naked player in a nuke zone”. They took it and ran with it and took away all the atoms in the process
---
That white armor is really rocking the Playmobil vibe...
---
I feel the same way.  I'm at the point now where I think the healthiest thing to do us take a break and play something different for awhile
---
Wow the dedication to bein a pos :/
---
They have no idea who you are and they are that stupid.
---
I had calculated wrong at first yesterday, and thought the grind was way easier to complete than it actually is. Luckily I realized quickly and was able to update before my post had many views. We all make mistakes. :P
---
The fact any of us are even considering lugging a video game to a vacation is indicative enough that Bethesda has grossly misinterpreted their product. This is a video game, an outlet after people get off work, not a fucking second job that we feel compelled to work on so we don't feel like we missed out.
---
Let's not forget the FOMO aspect. People here seem to flip their shit when a piece of content is gated behind a grind (Legendary Run), money (Atom Shop), or difficult/problematic content (Vault 94).
---
Why didn't they just let us break ammo down to their raw parts?  Instead of this consulted mess.
---
Another feature we’ve been asking for for 2 years. Instead they took all the atoms away.
---
And when you enter a cabin look at the paintings on the wall.... what about that?
---
&gt;I turned all my ballistic ammo into 20 mini nukes in like, 3 minutes.
---
You did what?! I'd have given you 40 for all your ammo if that was the case.  To each their own i suppose 🤷‍♂️
---
We will probably see rank skips for atoms later on.
---
They came back after reloading in. But the Gold Star one is still reading 0/5 despite 2 of the challenges already being conpleted. So I won't be able to do that today.
---
woo
---
Destiny also fell into this trap. It turns it into a chore every single day. Seasons/FOMO are the worst kind of thing for engagement, ironically. Unless of course you're addicted to it and then it's just like crack.
---
You're ranting. I didn't get past this ...
---
&gt;We have been duped in to yet another time-gated money-grab ...
---
I don't have time to read the scribbles of an entitled fool who thinks game development doesn't cost anything.  While I'm not a game programmer, I am a computer programmer, and my services run about $60 / hour. I imagine Bethesda's devs are drawing about the same if not more and Bethesda has to get that money somewhere sparky.
---
Who says Robin Hood didn’t use a flamethrower
---
And I don't even want to be a nay sayer. I know the math can be so much colder than reality. 
---
But yeah. Someone said this was designed for grinders, I would make a distinction with a difference. This is designed knowing most people aren't grinders and won't make level 100, hoping some of those will pay out of pocket. 
---
Good news is that you as a 1st sub you will be able to skip 33 levels, provided you use all your monthly atoms. 
---
REMEMBER TO WAIT TO SKIP AT THE END. By level 70 those 150 atoms will get you ~2500 points as opposed to ~1200 now. 
---
I'm a 1st sub too but I go monthly and I got tons saved up but now I'm more reluctant than ever to spend them.
---
It's full price right now, which for the us ww2 pilot outfit I want is 800 atoms. I was wondering if the price will decrease as the 12 days goes on.
---
Thx
---
nope
---
Yea had this happen on a queen fight this morning was hitting like wet noodles by the time it was over didn’t have anything to get my rads back quickly lol
---
Oh okay, so you’re just offering an opinion without even reading what you’re responding to then, that’s way more reasonable
---
Well, I could also wish to not work and still get money, but you know
---
it's a joke
---
OP is just pissy cause his gauss weapon isnt OP where he can kill the thing in 10 seconds like the SBQ lol
---
Your the delusional stupid one here. Every single mmorpg has tons of currency and that doesn’t mean shit. Bethesda has made every update feel like Ice cream not lipstick you gay bitch
---
The only person that should have there phone taken away is you you hateful bitch. Looks like you didn’t go to bed early like you were told to.
---
This is one of the best triple a mmos bethesda has ever made and it will stay that way. Stop being a hateful motherfucker and actually wake up stop dreaming and get back into reality before making stupid comments and you will see the work of art Bethesda has made. Dumbass
---
Life is nothing but a bunch of checklists of stuff to do an complete. I've been logging in the game every single day since day 1 doing daily an weeklies. This changes nothing for me. Probably missed a while 10 days since the game came out on weekly challenges.
---
Because its soooo funny and inventive to make a trap camp...
---
Look... when I see a trap camp, I want it to be inventive so I get a laugh out of it. Thats the point. Using Punji boards is doing the exact opposite... it's so uninteresting and boring.
---
Same here. I really wasn't having too many issues with vats before, but now it's very noticeable.
---
People act like things like scrapping junk and killing 10 scorched is pulling teeth lmao
---
Can see that lmao
---
last night I accidentally scrapped my shielded forest enclave under armor, THAT I WAS WEARING, and my heart skipped a beat (Especially since I thought I had scrapped my Deathclaw Fashnout mask. I would have cried if I did). luckily I have 2 urban ones, but I have to grind or find a forest one all over again. it should give you a prompt if you are about to scrap or sell something that you are wearing/using.
---
no I am still just dumping it in train station containers and the overseers camp
---
What? Throwing stuff away? In a Fallout game? You must be joking.
---
On a more serious note, I did just that a couple of minutes ago, maybe someone can use all the ammo that I left inside various containers around the Watoga station.
---
I know what I'm getting tonight! Thanks!
---
I don't mind it myself, just gets very tedious. Got really annoyed converting 3000 10mm rounds to get a few hundred 5.56 rounds. The idea is awesome but the execution is just horrible.
---
You most certainly can. I just seem to be doing it by myself. So somewhat redundant. The emotes work better.
---
Imagine being unable to actually respond to the logical arguments they make.
---
I share it with some of my friends and don't usually tell them, than laugh when they try to figure out what's off about their characters. I'd never do it in a public team though.
---
I onky convert the daily needs.  Some 2mm ec and 5mm.
---
The intent was there. The execution was poor
---
Also fuel is listed as 10 mm under energy
---
Bethesda thinks we need to spend MORE time mashing "A" smfh
---
I doubt many know this but there is a limit on the number of items you can give custom names to.
---
I switch up my shared cards depending on teammates shared perks and levels. Stranger in numbers, Dodgy, Tenderizer, Four Leaf Clover are all good ones. If my mates are all low levels, I'll look at Sturdy Frame, Bloody Mess, Action Boy.
---
Yeah I like the game, but damn, I like to play other games too, and I have a job. That's a lot of grind imo.
---
remove the ally equipment. put it back.
---
can also do this to change the quest if it doesn't give you a weapon one.
---
I don't think Ward got the message. [I just found his lazy ass sleeping in his bunk.](https://i.imgur.com/MmkbAX4.jpg)
---
Yup, I noticed this too. Also, they are silent.
---
wow thats actually kind of pogchamp
---
For comparison I did a very similar chart in excel this morning and I reached a very similar conclusion (everything, every day, no exceptions) and you'd hit level 100 on the last day with _maybe_ 1-2,000 or so SCORE to spare. I also did some quick math on if you did ALL the challenges EXCEPT the NW ones and it takes you to level 95 so you'd have to pay 750 atoms to unlock the last five levels to get all the things. Happy grinding, folks!
---
Just get the shielded one too,  no need for the others honestly.
---
Console players don't deserve the shit that happens on PC. Crossplay between Microsoft and Sony could work though.
---
Is there a TLDR version of this?
---
The damage stack is amazing if all use it and play bloodied. I dont use Marsupial so I don't see those extra hops. I should probably start using something else as I didn't really consider it bothering people.
---
I'd imagine three Charisma is less common than you think. If you've never played in teams up till now it's basically been worthless, especially when the other SPECIALs are more important for perk builds. I've had 2 Charisma for the longest time just for Lone Wanderer but I've never had any desire to level this up further, and now it would require a decent shuffle around of my perks.
---
Me: Ok, the first Brotherhood daily quest on my long journey to max out rep. I guess I talk to this armored guy? Let's see what I got to do.
---
Brotherhood: Finally! Someone with the guts to help!
---
Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Damn. That sucks. I'm sorry, man.
---
about what?
---
Got it sorted now :) just need ti kvl up
---
You're not factoring in the atom value of all of the other rewards.  Even if you aren't interested in everything there's going to be a lot of stuff that you likely would have just bought otherwise if they'd been put up in the atom shop.  I would have spent almost 3500 atoms if they'd just gradually added this stuff to the shop over the course of the season, but now I just get them plus a whole bunch of other stuff.
---
I really wish it was powerful. It would be nice to take some of the grind out of the game before adding more layers. And where I run auto rifles ammo is a large grind for me.
---
I thought that at first but I think they lag and take a while to play. The brotherhood one has someone talking but the message is broken up. The encrypted one just has a lot of scrambled sounds.
---
The whole problem is that I started a whole new character for this season thing, hoping that since quests give a ton of XP that breezing through the quest and picking up XP would be lining up with the game board. Im now stuck with a low level character that cant do much of the events and its boring to sit out and let the team handle it for you.
---
Mine stays, in the newb area, publicly accessible. I'll not use it because  I can make more ammo in a minute than exchange in an hour. But Newbs can't...
---
Ill show ya but i want to preserve the secret waus
---
Cutting off your nose to spite your face.
---
No, but there is a perk, legendary armor, jetpacks and Power armor wich can keep you from dying due to fall damage.
---
No?
---
It's usually just the extra 25% jump height that drives them nuts. It's great for nuked whitesprings though. No roof is off limits.
---
I would really like the system, if it wasen´t time gated. Just put the stuff as Content in the game and lock it behind challenges.
---
When I see thats somethings is time gated and takes long term constant play, I´m always giving up a bit mentally. It just feels more like work and less like a game.
---
I really cant believe people saying "suck it up" about doing NW challenges for the points... This is a GAME, not our Job. Its something we do in our little freetime and which we should be able to enjoy the way we want without getting pressured constantly with this FOMO crap. Content don´t hast to be time gated, and the game could really need more long term content.
---
xboxxerx
---
Damn, we got a commie.
---
You do realize that the people whining about this are the ones that have likely never paid for atoms to begin with right?
---
thank you very much. will take a look and see if I can find it.
---
Egrogey. Pleasures all mine. 3-4 hour from off.
---
If they implemented F2P, they'd be doing it to draw in people who otherwise wouldn't have touched the game.  While the people who actually care about the franchise payed to play the game.  This would be another PR disaster for them.
---
On top of this F2P will draw EVERY type of gamer.  So this community of good natured, helpful people who would share their last stimpack just to help someone, will be drowned by all the incoming selfish/asshole/griefer players who don't give a crap about anyone outside themself.
---
I think F2P would be a horrible idea.
---
I’m just wondering if they are in over their heads trying to do these big DLC story expansions instead of just methodically layering in new side quests and allies to keep the world fresh. Given the delays getting Wastelanders out, it seems they’ve locked themselves into having to rely on low effort filler content for months at a time while they frantically work to build out the bigger story stuff we really want. I personally just don’t see a lot of sustained interest in 76 after we all get through the BoS DLC if they don’t seriously mix up the content release formula.
---
You mean other than the fact they have a different icon, are free to travel to, and the loading screen tips about them? Yeah, game makes zero distinction.
---
Nice!!! Had no idea that’s been added. I know they changed the rate at which the WC spawns, it’s now a standard 10% chance. Fought my first one last night but didn’t check if anything new unlocked. I’m curious now!
---
Well once you hit lvl. 20 do the quest that say talk to the overseer. The raiders are hostile to everyone until you hit a point in the new story quest
---
Probably pushed back to pad out the content more.
---
I get a random loading screen when I wanna fast-travel somewhere that doesn't end. Happend to me twice and had to restart the game :/
---
Mine is 4, so I share Inspirational or Strange in Numbers.
---
Because i own those two.
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Ref material
---
Yea I am aware of that, but my goal is to prevent my base from killing other players, not from killing me haha
---
Well that too lol
---
So missing out on a week and you wont be able to complete the season? Welp
---
The only thing I really want is that fireplace secret door.. and that's the second last reward so..
---
Doubtful. Brand new items almost never get a discount. I’ve only seen it happen one time; the day after the AstroTurf floor was supposed to be Vaulted it got a 30% discount, which was apparently an error. 
---
It would be very surprising if the new item got a discount during its first run. Consider how that would be unfair to those that buy it on day one, and then on day ten it gets a discount; that would be viewed as deceptive marketing by many in the community.
---
That explains the wreath I unlocked last night!
---
I'm aware. The only further message that can be made is to not play, but obviously if they're here they're not going to.
---
Definitely. I have those cards unlocked. But I don’t use them. Like you, I also have a b2525 handmade. Which I’ve been using for forever. Before I hit ally with the raiders, I did have a slightly different build. Less in strength, more in perception, agility and luck. I had ground pounder(or whatever it’s called) in perception for the increased accuracy and reload speed, I had 3 more points in agility for adrenaline and action boy, or I swapped one of those out for the sneak attack perk card. And I had 3 more points in luck for either serendipity, tormentor, or better crits. But like I said, after unlocking the gauss minigun, and after a month of crafting, finally rolled a b2525 gauss minigun, I switched things up. I will probably do something similar when I finally hit ally with the settlers.
---
Ohhh thanks. I guess you’re more patient than I am haha!
---
Lol! This!
---
yeah that should be added to
---
this is in the same cartegory
---
A lot of people in this subreddit have never played an MMO before, and it shows. "You want me to play EVERY DAY to get these high end rewards?!"
---
I've actually enjoyed doing these events, wear those outfits and use those camp plans. If you don't like the game don't play it.
---
I was waiting on meat week too. A little disapointed but it probably got pushed back.
---
I'm not sure what build you're running, but if you're a commando or rifleman, try using a Railway Rifle. I've found that VATS still works extremely well with it. Only problem with it is the recoil but if you use VATS a lot it shouldn't be a problem.
---
LeeroyJenkins032. I’m PS4 also. Add me and if I’m running join up. East coaster here but the main dude I run with is west coast
---
Haha.
---
No item I can think of, but your idea of building over a body of water would work.
---
Last post from Bethesda in the PTS forums stated it wasn't assigned and being "looked into".
---
Zero word after that and that was about 2 weeks back.
---
Only 6600 hrs left until you get those 20 atoms
---
Old rewards. So, no sense right now.
---
Destiny 2 didn’t get much negative pr for going f2p as far as I saw as a casual player. And it’s not like they care about that anyway or they would not have did fallout first WHILE delaying wastelanders-a move that would only hurt them in the public eye.
---
In my experience, I freeze her with my two-shot cryo, switch to my furious plasma gatling. By the time the gatling is spun up, she's mostly thawed already. I get maybe 10 shots of a low dmg per hit weapon, before I need to switch back to my lower dmg per hit cryo.
---
Personally I think that in future seasons we should be able to get past season rewards if we reach the reward rank. Say you got to level 80 but missed out on the last 20 rewards, next season if you got to 80 and then had enough time you could get the new rewards and the rewards from the previous season too
---
i've played plenty of games that never made it to the release light of day, haven't gotten my money back
---
I haven't been paying attention to that. Just noticing it through the challenges. But I will admit that the SCORE points are being rewarded way too early in some cases.
---
Example: one of the challenges was to collect building material. I had 3/5 completed, just as I get the 4th one done the SCORE points popped up which confused me. It happened a few times with other challenges.
---
They really just need to do eso content schedualing . 2 big dlcs a year with 2 patches that have dungeons or something. Those 2 big ones need mechanics that are also fun. Grind isnt inherently bad as long as its fun.
---
This post is satisfying
---
I agree but I also don’t think people should be punished for not logging in daily, some people can only play once a week but then play for 12 hours that one day. They’ll be at more of a disadvantage to me who can play for just 7 hours a week but daily. I think there should be mechanics that are suitable for both those play styles
---
&gt;Oh not to mention the insane lag and frame rate spikes that I didn't have before the update which has rendered my game nearly unplayable. Icing, meet cake.
---
I just started playing again last night for the first time in about a year. I thought my PC was fucking up or something, good to know it's not just me having ridiculous spikes. I can't do combat at all. 
---
I wanted to give the game a new try, after updates n' such... does not sound promising though.
---
The only thing that isn't going to change are the amount of points you get from weeklies and dailies, assuming the amount of points they will allow you to get per day and week are the same every time. The repeatable exp challenge is what varies because you can do it more than once in a day.
---
Yeah, I want to play the game less because it's just becoming more stressful. There's way too much FOMO and obligation. Like, am I playing a video game for fun or working and getting yelled at by my boss for not wanting to stay late?
---
People have fun playing Ride to Hell Retribution. “Fun” does not excuse a fundamentally broken, manipulative product. For a very long time I convinced myself to enjoy this “game”, acted like you are. I look back and see that I caused both myself and others misery because Bethesda manipulated me into doing so. Wake up.
---
"And we know this game is no stranger to misinformation among all the valid criticisms-- just yesterday I was in a discord where some person posted three flagrant lies about this new system in an attempt to bash Bethesda, things that could have been fact-checked in 5 minutes. I posted several corrections and had a moderator of this discord tell me that big corporations don't need defenders-- that was their response, not saying hey, truth is better than falsehoods, but implicitly criticizing me for saying anything that could be viewed as defense of Bethesda."
---
I was doing my millionth run of Fort Defiance so any kind of distraction was good. I only notice as I went to turn the radio on the drown out ghoul sounds.
---
Actually you are right. Lone wanderer is not that good now. I use my own build where I have 3 ranks in Tenderizer and Strange in numbers so thats enough to share one perk.
---
My bet is yea but then you’ll be able to buy in the shop
---
Happens to me all the time. Just keep refreshing your game.
---
All games have limits, whether they are necessary or imposed by design doesn't matter. Limits provide balanced development over time. Do you complain that when playing Monopoly that you only get 200 for passing go?  :)  
---
Considering that everyone plays by the same limits, it is fair. No one has any advantage that you do not. It feels like your complaint is that Bethesda doesn't want you getting everything in one go, while you feel entitled to get everything you want, now.
---
I've had to have a similar conversation with my son - that some things take time, patience and work to get. Just because someone wants something, doesn't mean they are entitled to get it. Keep in mind, my son is 5.
---
The break to fix ratio you provide is anecdotal, but reality shows that while there may occasionally be setbacks, development is flowing ever forward to a better end result. I have been in software development positions in the past. With something as involved as 76, there are certain to be unforeseen ramifications to the changes that are made. Some can be avoided through testing, some cannot, some fall through the cracks when there is the imposition of a deadline. We must remember, those at Bethesda, are simply people, people that are working hard on a game you play. They are not infallible, they are not out to annoy you. They are doing their jobs, to make a game, and continue to improve it. Cut them some slack.
---
Agreed. Just pure complaining. I do think some things should be changed but just come on, stop whining people!
---
Stop complaining and go do your chores. Those score and treasury notes need to earned. When your chores are done THEN, and only Then, you can got back to reality and work. /s
---
There was so much participation my melee build never got a hit in, so I sat on a roof and watched (I don’t have a ranged weapon on that character and the level 2-900s were all one shotting everything before it’d even spawned in properly. Even the Sheepsquatch at the end of free range was one shotted by some dickhead commando build.
---
The servers finally feel alive. More people doing events. More teams about and people being friendly. Public teams should’ve been included at launch, but I’m glad we finally got them!
---
Yeah I also have only used the treasure hunter outfit since it came out. The mole miner event could have been done better but I actually really liked the rewards
---
I heard the magic guns got patched away.
---
looking at it now. thx
---
i think its supposed to be sturdy, but it wasnt working with the legendary perks.
---
i guess we'll find out
---
Unfortunately at this point those people leaving the game are seen as collateral to keep the cash flow going up.
---
You dont matter anymore because there will always be someone with their pocketbook willing to cover twice what you took away by moving on.
---
The thing is there is a lack of new games because of the new generation so most people dont rly have anything else to do
---
I dumped it. I went to the SBQ event and dropped it in someone’s tent. Their headache now
---
Sometimes, it feels like beth is actively trying to drive away the player base so they can end support for the game. lol
---
They are not free travel on ps4. I still pay caps.

Overall I have enjoyed the game ever since it launched, and I have been really happy with the new content. But, my style of gameplay has never been to grind out dailies, I don't worry about getting the XP and I don't really worry about getting the Atoms. I don't play on teams, and I pretty much do my own thing. If there's something I want, or a particular thing I want to achieve then I grind and do it. So while I find season's intriguing, it is starting to feel like it is becoming my career. I am not someone who will play any game for 7 hours a day, usually. And I know that Bethesda says that the goals can be accomplished typically in 2 hours... but when you're playing solo, it doesn't quite work out that way. And that's the part I don't like. Seasons feels a bit too demanding and is requiring for me at least, quite a commitment.
---
So I'm definitely in the middle of the road on this one, I don't hate it but I certainly don't love it either.
---
I expect that I will play around with it for a little while and then go back to my regular game play.
---
And again... that doesn't really send a message either.  Of course companies want to keep their active user numbers up, but if someone that doesn't provide them any revenue decides to stop playing they're not directly losing out on any money.
---
Aye I have three times now, getting beyond a joke.
---
Yea I did the queen fight this morning with all the daily’s an weekly done but the NW one an didn’t get any score for the queen fight
---
Well, uh, I admire your honesty, lol.
---
The update broke your game a day before it was launched?
---
I didn't play yesterday because $work... so I guess I already lost out. ggwp. lol
---
Yea it's weird. Lone Wanderer was basically S-tier in terms of perks for solo players. It's basically the only one I've ever used for that slot because of how good it is compared to the other cards. Had to read through them all today to get something good in the slot since I realised with teams I'm probably never going to play "solo" again.
---
Haven't had much issue with that, though I'm sure I read in the patch notes that they fixed a load of stability issues?
---
Kudos for using an honest preface in your title. 
---
However, if you’ve done everything you want to do in the game, why not find a new game to play?  There are a lot of fakes that after I finished all the content I didn’t go back to replay. Even when the Broken Steel DLC cane out for Fallout 3, which let you continue playing even after all the content form the game and the DLCs was completed, I didn’t keep grinding endlessly. 
---
Why are you doing so in this game, or believe that you need to do so?
---
There are a lot of great games out there. Perhaps instead of lamenting that you finished this one, you go start a new one?
---
Later
---
Which is better, the Raider ammo collector or the ammo converter reward?
---
It was not added yet along with Legendary Perks. They are changing a few things due to feedback.
---
That sounds like the build I’m working on right now lol. I was going to see if your advice worked with some tweaks to my play style. Take a look if you don’t mind. Let me know if only 1 pt in E or C is a huge problem.
---

---
Plus the point that EVERY SINGLE thing that's come out since wastelanders has been locked behind either a time gate, grind or RNG. Sometimes all three. It's annoying. On top of every grind we had previously.
---
i wonder if anyone actually got them yet.
---
I know there's people with like 4000 hours.
---
Yeah I liked it. And each level usually gave more then 1 item. And with the gold rewards it actually pays for itself. Wish they would release them more, though. When did the last one end, beginning of April?
---
Yes. Certainly come back. It’s bonus XP for events joining a team is as easy as finding a slot open on a public one. Two to three button clicks later you’ll have teammates sharing perk cards, and everyone is grinding end game real hard.
---
I was in the middle of a very intense encryptid yesterday and leveled up my score while getting blasted by the imposter sheepsquatch   and the game thought it would be a good idea to cover the entire middle of my screen with a cute little graphic of a loot box, causing me to get killed.
---
People are saying it a lot and it can be viewed as a little hyperbolic, but I genuinely believe they are not testing this game. Not only are the developers coming up with first-round ideas and doing the bare minimum to refine them, they then get implemented without a system of checks and balances to give feedback. The entire chain is broken at every link. It's getting to the point where I'm considering putting this thing down and never coming back.
---
I have enough caps that I don't even look at prices when I fast travel. I had to look up what the icon meant. I thought it just meant it was a high level activity meant for 50+ since the game doesn't say "Public Event" and just says "Event" while it has other distinctions like "Enclave Event". I also haven't done many events overall so I thought it was just for newer events and they never went back and did it for all of them. Even knowing those things there is no reason to think that those are public events while the other events are regular ones other than "The loading screen is telling me what I have to do" which would naturally lead someone to think that it's more difficult, not that it's a "public" event since anyone can already do any event by fast traveling to it.
---
I’m still here too. But poster is right, I’m just about done too. This is getting hard to defend and justify.
---
No worries, I seriously appreciate these updates!
---
 I posted this on a different post with this topic but feel its relevant and can be echoed here.
---
I'd wager one of the hardest balances in game design is trying to accommodate casual play and dedicated players. Especially when they are fundamentally opposites. People ask for more to do, more to grind, and at the same time other people are asking for more streamlined.
---
I'd accept this season since it is Free, but I certainly feel like if you pay for a season pass then you are entitled to its contents even if you don't finish the progression. If you are paying for it then the Progression should only exist as a way to get the content early. End of the season, all of what you paid for is given to you, but I can also see how others may see that as a way to unincentivies playtime.
---
&gt;complete the weekly once per day
---
Oh is that all
---
Nope, got five of them (Junkies FFR UGL, Junkies Accelerated Minigun, Stalker's Accelerated Minigun, Quad 50 Limb Flechette Harpoon Gun, and now an Instigating Accelerated Minigun) and all still work. Server latency make some of them not trigger the "magic" effect properly, so I stick to using the Junkies weapons, which are meant to give damage bonus anyway.
---
Funny thing was I had the quad harpoon gun for ages and I didn't realize that it being one-hit in VATS was due to a bug.
---
Oh, and in the event they do get patched out, I wouldn't mind a Vampiric FFR UGL. 1000 rounds that heal me constantly? Sign me up!
---
they want the fortnite audience
---
One of the huge presumptions from people is that because this week has a repeatable of earn XP, they presume that this will continue for the next 10 weeks.
---
We may well get a different repeatable next week, e.g. complete 5 public events.
---
Yeah 2000 daily SCORE if you're counting the NW challenge witch most people aren't willing to do. So realistically most people are only going to get 1750 per day through dailies. Getting to 100 is like a 5 hour daily grind every single day for 10 weeks.
---
No def not (besides gamepass being overpriced haha). I do have gamepass for 2 more years though for only $1
---
So just go back to your high level character
---
The ammo collector. You just set it and collect.
---
math or not, the grind is atrocious and is fundamentally bad for the overall health and player sentiment of the game.
---
Yeah I know, but I'm hoping I get enough atoms for it tho. Just gotta stay focused and determined
---
No idea where you are from, but around here, Fall is a great time for grilling meat.
---
Ha ha ha I love that title. Pretty much sums up my first couple tries at that event too.
---
The first 500 posts about this same exact thing I was just like "meh, can't be that bad"
---
This right here is the one that finally pushed me over the edge and lit a fire under my ass.  Hats off to you, you have done it!!!  Bethesda will feel our wrath!!
---
The best use I have found for it so far is missiles actually give a decent rate and free up a lot of weight so...at least that's a use.
---
Personlly find 2049 a slightly better film.
---
People are really blowing all this out of proportion. First of all that repeatable weekly for earning 10k exp is incredibly easy to earn multiple times a play session. Especially if you have time to dump almost 8 hours a day over the weekends. This makes ranking up a lot easier than people seem to realize. Public events are also supposed to earn SCORE but appear to be bugged currently. If they get that fixed soon enough it will be even easier to rank up. Finally, you are not entitled to every single limited time reward. If you can't put in the time and work, sorry, but that's how it goes. At least Bethesda will let the whales buy their way to rank 100 if they really can't miss anything but can't actually put in the effort and play the game.
---
Power armor. Check out some of Angry Turtle's videos on YouTube!! 👍👍
---
Okay..... 
---
You are calling me a dumbass when you can’t tell the difference between “you’re” and “your”. 
---
Please don’t use the term “gay” as a homophobic slur, it’s not big &amp; it’s not clever. Do it again &amp; I’ll report you to the mods.
---
You are replying to a different person than the one you conversed with about your bed time.
---
Now with that out of the way...
---
The game, it is okay to love the game. It is fine to hate the game. I think most people are somewhere in between &amp; that ebbs &amp; flows. What’s not okay is, however you feel about the game there is no need for hyperbole &amp; vitriol. The original post here was about someone’s frustration at the lack of substance in the latest update. You may disagree but your response was that of a petulant child. 
---
You tried to speak for the community in their love for the “triple a” game update. If only Reddit had a way of illustrating how many people agree with you? Maybe an upvote and a downvote system.... ohhh wait a minute, they have &amp; you were downvoted.
---
Please stop with the homophobia, calm down in your responses, try to be more level headed and perhaps you may be more successful in your endeavours.
---
Oh wow, didn't know that. I've been manually installing mods all this time. Lemme try that out once work's done.
---
"Directly"
---
But that does inevitably result in loss. People stop talking about it, vouching for it, etc. While sure you're not expected to buy the game twice and once you've bought it they have your money, but when you're stifling your potential growth in userbase and hurting your returning players to the point that they no longer wish to play, at some point it results in an end. And again assuming where we are, I'd like to think that we can hope that they would start listening to their target audience so that they game can turn into a success or at the very least be something we continue to enjoy. Especially when people are continuing to see the game as a chore instead of an enjoyable adventure experience.
---
And here we have it. Its more log in every day and spend 2-3 hours at that or miss out. This is just not a wise decision. I logged in last night for the first time in around 2-3 weeks and even on my private server with just the wife and me it was so janky that my input controls seemed to not be working my HUD interfaces were still trash and I'm still freezing on my wheel. Now keep in mind that this is on XB1x with an SSD and a near flawless ethernet connection.(1gb) I just don't see wanting to do this every day for long as I love this game so much but some days the frustration it brings out in me is just not worth it. They need to optimize this game and they need to do it yesterday. We all want content but we also want a working game that doesn't feel like going back to the stone ages when we leave a proper shooter and come back.
---
They arent punishing you, check your router
---
Fallout 1st isn't the same.  Everyone paid for the game, and people have the option of paying for a subscription on top of that for extra stuff.
---
F2P is basically saying "Hey guys that care about our franchise, you gave us your money to play this, right? Well, we're going to offer the EXACT same game to tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb for free.  You cool with that bro?"
---
As far as I'm aware, Destiny 2 was a dying game before they introduced F2P, that isn't the case here.  On top of that, Destiny has no where near the fanbase of Fallout, so yeah i could see people caring less with Destiny going F2P than FO76
---
***(Edit: Yes, delaying Wastelanders for Fallout 1st was a bad move that blew up in their face, which only strengthens what i said about going F2P, it would be a magnitude worse for them)***
---
Then how to get cores easily?
---
But then that's my main issue. There is nothing new added in to the game to do with this horrendous grind.
---
Kill the same high level ghouls and mutants that I've already done a million times in the same places.
---
Do events that we've all done a million times by now.
---
That's how it will burn people out doing it now everyday for 10 weeks if they wish to get to 100
---
Workshops, or events in Cranberry bog
---
Could be worse, could gave been a Rank 20 Item hahaha the rage on reddit would be unreal xD
---
Every time someone calls him Graham Todd drowns a kitten.
---
He just wanders around, my camp used to be where the wayward is and I caught him by my house a lot.
---
Hahaha me too
---
It's not about the difficulty. If someone wants to get all of the rewards by only doing NW then they should be able to. If someone wants to do it with only Adventure mode then they should be able to. Nobody should feel like they have to do the mode they don't want to play when it comes to seasons. I am someone who is horrible at PvP in any game. I've had matches where I die before I can even open a box. That isn't fun for anyone. I shouldn't be forced to feel like I have to put aside time to rank up in a mode that I have zero desire to play.
---
I bought it. Course I'm a stay at home dad...during quarantine...with nothing better to do. But it will be funny to see now all the low level players showing up to the sbq and run like hell when they see her for the first time lol
---
There's no reward?
---
I thought it would be a picture of a dump after some of the reviews of the operating system of the ammo converter...lol
---
Actually chilling or just passing through? He has a massive route around the map, shouldn't be wasting time checking out peoples digs, he and Chally have meat to sell.
---
Destiny also does very good trailers.
---
40mm, missiles, and mini nukes? Lol
---
It's not happening to me and I can hardly see the right side of the map for all the challenges I have tracked which is a pain when my camp is that side of the map.
---
Xbox btw
---
Hey man, about the dailies, non-NW players never count the NW crap, that might be the difference on the dailies. Regular 76 player never count the NW crap as part of the game.
---
I completely agree. I had a hard enough time with the bullion grind, and forthcoming real life stuff and other games make it unlikely that I’ll be able to get anywhere near level 100 (some have calculated you’ll need to go over and above each daily/weekly).
---
I’m very close to calling it quits. So far it’s FOMO keeping me around, but it’s just not entirely enjoyable any more and isn’t that why we’re meant to be playing?
---
It was like 3K 38 and a bunch of misc shit
---
Regardless of the atom loss, I like being able to freely party up with people.  Events are often full (similar to Faschnacht).  The game feels more alive now 
---
I like that I no longer have to equip a protest sign and level up on deathclaw island as a daily challenge.  Removing that aspect makes challenges easier
---
Ahh. I don’t have a scrap box lol
---
I agree I can be but I was genuine with this on. Seriously.
---
Its in a similar vein i guess, burn it/throw it in the garbage, same same.
---
I had a very similar experience on my first SBQ run except it was a Hound and, well, the hound won.
---
One thing I've learned about this community is that everyone there was probably happy to help you.  It's a pretty supportive group.
---
If they would stop timegating and and take away the al the Caps (caped caps, caped scrip, caped gold etc.) it wouldnt feel so grindy, because we could just enjoy it at our own pace. 
---
All this stuff takes away the fun and makes it a chore, because if you dont play there way, you dont make any progress.
---
Why cant i farm 1000 scrip today and dont farm any tomorrow? Why is it important that i play when they tell us to? Why cant I trade bullions when I have time and want to?
---
They make this thing more complicated then it needs to be.
---
It has been 596 days since it was released.  If you played 8 hours per day you would have 4,768 hours play.
---
To have 7600 hours today you would have had to play 12.75 hours per day.
---
True...lol
---
That s where it should be. Have it in camp but not for much longer. Such a good idea gone foul.
---
Did you let the queen spawn? If the queen spawns your reward sucks and you dont seem to get xp.
---
Work on your Social/Combat/Character/World challenges. There are a lot of those that are very easy to complete and can get you a good amount of Atoms quickly. 
---
Best of luck!!
---
It's more than just an icon change.  
---
1. First, let's detail the issues caused but the icon itself. You can no longer identify workshops on the map. You can no longer tell what resources a workshop can give. You can no longer tell which workshops are already claimed. You cannot even tell that a workshop YOU claimed is yours.
---
2. You cannot fast travel to your own workshops for free anymore. This means you have to pay caps to jump to your workshop when the workshop defense missions come up.
---
3. The issue is inconsistent. You may join a server and find the icons are what they should be. Additionally, the bug doesn't occur to all players on the same server. This means when you are experiencing the bug, Bethesda is putting you at a disadvantage compared to other players who aren't.
---
Drop in to water no damage then.
---
According to PlayerCounts.com Fallout 76 has like 30k players. Destiny 2 has 900k.
---
TLDR: It's possible to 100% complete the season in 10 weeks, which is how much time we've been given, and maybe a sooner if you grind XP well and/or use the atoms gained to buy ranks. But if you want full completion you are definitely going to have to grind for it and complete the vast majority of challenges.
---
I share Blocker 2. Less melee damage = good.
---
No doubt.
---
That's the most annoying thing. Better systems already exist in the game. There's no reason for it to be a terminal other than the art team pushing for a terminal because it looks cooler. There's no reason for the interface inside the terminal and those hierarchies to be set up the way they were other than their interface designer not having any idea what they're doing. It's like they grabbed an intern on a coffee run and threw them in front of a fresh install of Adobe XD. These problems have gone from being annoying to legitimately anger inducing lol. It's just a stupid video game, but watching them make mistake after mistake at literally every single turn makes you want to push them in the mud. I want to push Todd into some mud!
---
Oh wow, do you have that kind of sky base that hangs over a cliff?
---
melee. It's OP. saves ammo as well. 
---
Draw back is when you get to 50 and want to make an endgame build it'll take you a while to sort your build out (at 50 you can move a point or pick a perk every level up)
---
That’s kind of what I thought to.
---
I don’t know if he was actually chilling or just stuck in my structure but he stayed around as long as I was their. At least 5-6 minutes.
---
That’s the difference though. It’s not because I’m lazy and don’t want to earn it. It’s that the challenges are limited to dailies and weeklies. As I said, I can get in ~15 hours on a good weekend but that doesn’t account for every weekend over 10 weeks. I can get in ~2 hours a night on a good night. But I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to do that every single night. Once I fall behind 3-4 days and maybe can’t play on the weekend, what then? Tying progression to specific challenges requires people to log in everyday to maximize their xp. I’ve played CoD a total of 10 hours this season and I’m half way through that pass. And that’s because I play with friends on the weekends when they WANT to play not when they feel like they HAVE to play.
---
Take a break from the sub. The nonsense posts and comments definitely grate on you after awhile. Join the dataminer discord if you haven't already since most of the major tools or info dumps happen there so you won't miss out if you are interested. I felt refreshed after taking a two week hiatus and i'm less active on here than you.
---
It had the keyword for heavy armor assigned in the PTS.
---
clearly OP has a point when the most common rebuttal is "why dont you play another game"
---
I have a fasnatch collectron and he gives me a shitone of food and drink so im fine
---
I have a love/hate relationship with those goddamn crickets.  On one hand, I see one and go “ohh, acid!”  But when you’ve got tunnel vision going on, they sneak up and donkey punch my bloodied commando. Not an issue at all with my PA heavy, though.
---
I  completed 7 daily quests yesterday, but only got credit for four, one shy of a reward. :(
---
I don't understand the downvote other than maybe no one else is experiencing it, but it was a real problem for me yesterday.
---
That's been confirmed for awhile, it'll cost 150 atoms to complete one rank. Players will be able to start buying ranks two weeks from yesterday.
---
That's why I was saying you can spend the 1500 atoms the season gives you to buy ranks 90-100 and save yourself some time.
---
They make it look so epic lol. I really can’t wait for the new events and brotherhood of steel content
---
Cool? Does Fallout 76 need 900k players? no.  Does Bethesda want 900k players? yeah.  But they will ***destroy*** their fanbase in the process, which is my point here.
---
Edit:
---
&gt;Destiny has no where near the fanbase of Fallout.
---
Is this why you posted player counts? You do realise millions of people get CoD every year, but to say that's millions of diehard fans is not true.  The Fallout Franchise has more diehard fans of the world built etc., most people play FPS games because it's what their friends play
---
That's a good point. If that's the case, the FAQ *technically* isn't lying. But it's very far from what people expected.
---
If there is such a challenge, it should be possible to datamine.
---
The best part about this is that CHR is for sure a prime candidate to put 9 points in and sacrifice places in other stats.  IMO it is worth it, and iv always played this way since a lot of times I will play with other people.
---
Well sometimes your friends aren't playing during a time period or no one is around.  So tbh it kind of sucks when you log in alone and have Herd Mentality and Empath.  It sucks not to be able to share all the great 3 star perk cards I'm able to share with players.  
---
Now I can always find a group and give my team extra EXP, or give them one of the strong LUCK 3\* perk cards.  I mean its endless, but sharing perk cards has always been the coolest thing to me while pairing with the team mutations.  
---
I don't have to 100% rely on my friends to want to play the game the same time as me, or maybe feel awkward asking them to log in and play while the're off playing a newer game they just got into.
---
I sacrifice 1 point in STR, and some in PER to get to 9 CHR.  I'm a rifle build, so I only have 2 points in STR, yeah having lvl 2 traveling pharmacy does suck compared to level 3, but gear can help fix that.  In the end I come out with.  2 STR | 9 PER | 1 E | 9 CHR | 5 INT | 15 AGL | 15 LCK.  Seems kind of weird not maxing PER.. but tbh theres no way im taken anything off of OP AGL and LUCK, those cards are way to good.  My acc seems good enough sacrificing the PER, esp if you use unyeild armor, which I use 4 pieces of, sometimes 5.  Gotta love that 1 END though, when you need water boy you got it, when you want extra STR you got it.
---
Rant over, I'm gonna go log on check out the new patch and share my perk cards with other players who want to team up.
---
Punji boards work
---
&gt;Xp from repeatable is not included in this calculation) And may be  doable by just doing the repeatable one. But the fact stays still.
---
How the fuck are you NOT including the repeatable challenge when by default you're constantly completing the fucking thing while doing the other challenges?
---
If you're doing EVERY challenge every day to maximize your earned points then that means you're completing the "level up" challenge seven times a week.  If you're over level 100 a single level takes 15880exp and seven levels would be 111160exp earned in a week minimum.
---
This means that just by completing these "level up" challenges you're also earning enough experience to complee the 10000exp challenge at least eleven times which adds up to an additional 1100 SCORE a week.
---
That means that by those numbers you're by default NOT earning 21500 points a week but instead 22600 meaning that after ten weeks you can potentially earn 222600 points, or more than you even need to hit 100 without having to do any additional grinding.
---
Ya but you can get the challenges done in an hour or a few.
---
So I'm not sure if this is the case, but it seems sometimes like it is giving SCORE at inappropriate times.  For example if you have the challenge to kill robots, it may give the score early, and then not credit you for it later if you've killed say 5 liberators or whatever.  I think this could be responsible for people thinking they are getting SCORE for other things as well, and causing some of the confusion.
---
For those not aware of this:
---
1. First,  let's detail the issues caused but the icon itself. You can no longer  identify workshops on the map. You can no longer tell what resources a  workshop can give. You can no longer tell which workshops are already  claimed. You cannot even tell that a workshop YOU claimed is yours.
---
2. You  cannot fast travel to your own workshops for free anymore. This means  you have to pay caps to jump to your workshop when the workshop defense  missions come up.
---
3. The  issue is inconsistent. You may join a server and find the icons are  what they should be. Additionally, the bug doesn't occur to all players  on the same server. This means when you are experiencing the bug,  Bethesda is putting you at a disadvantage compared to other players who aren't.
---
Sure. You get things like 8 different ghillie suits, none of which I would buy if they were in the Atom shop.
---
Serious question ...... any recommendations for games similar to fo76? After reading reviews, Ark and Rust are a pass for me.
---
that's easy for a lot of people tbh
---
When CoD ghosts came out the #1 player for HC kill confirmed played an average of 18 hours a day (going by time played and how long game had been out). I only know this because they would enter a lobby and i announce that they were the number one player in the world but they were only there because they had played 3 times more than the nearest person. They were quite shit at the game and would leave if you killed them.
---
I’m thinking it’s random too.
---
The only thing that gives me pause is because I’ve been at this location for awhile and never seen him.
---
I imagine most of y'all showed up to reinforce the truth that crickets are seriously OP. I wasn't disappointed.
---
This is getting out of hand!! Now there are two of them!!
---
yes, that was my thought too.  I'll go and help the lvl 10 players doing the Cargo Drop at the Morgantown Airport.  Let them get a few shots in, and then sniper the scorched before they get overrun.  When I'm level 150 would I mind a level 40 or 50 hiding in the bunker during a SBQ fight?  Nope, not at all.  :)
---
I was very concerned about this game being an MMO RPG, but almost all the players I've encountered have been very nice.
---
That might be why idk i joined late
---
I think this is fine, but i feel like this type of post repeats after every update. A lot of people go, "this new stuff is amazing!" 1 week later. "this game needs more content. end game SuCkS."
---
I still haven't completed Wastelanders. I still enjoy the game, but don't have the "need" to do it all as fast as i can or to do all of it. I never got to do that darn raid.
---
People actually buy .38s as backup in my experience lol, although I couldnt get rid of explosive ammo if I offered to pay the person to take them lol, so they get dropped lol
---
Im not 18 yet and i dont have a job and im burnt out by even the thought of playing fallout 76 because of this stupid grind
---
Suckers Continue Offering Repeated Expenditures
---
Daily challenges are easier, but also much less rewarding. I'd take Atoms over almost all of the stuff in this season pass.

The fact is I have to set aside that time each day to do them instead of being able to make up the score I didn’t earn the day before. It’s not about how quickly I can do the dailies. I’m talking about once you miss a day, that 1000 score is no longer available to be earned. It’s like it’s homework. If I fall behind for 3 days, making it all up is going to be a lot harder. And that’s not how it should be. But I digress, if that’s how Bethesda wants to do the pass, I’ll just play other games.
---
Yea I'm sure that will factor in for many. I imagine we'll see a lot of bush wookies in the near future lol.
---
Thank you for putting this in better words than I could, this is exactly what is happening to me and it's a big issue as I only just started playing again a couple of days ago so losing hundreds of caps a day travelling back and forth to defend my workshops is a big issue.
---
OMG I just found Lou, you guys are so right, his accent is the best, the dude in Foundation sounds terrible.
---
What’s the point of a finish line in a race?
---
im still 47 btw 😁
---
I'm gonna collect everyone's dumped ammo, put Enya on Spotify over the top of F76 and convert every fucking round the community drops on my FREE converter.
---
Please make your loot bags highly visible. No parachute bags thanks.
---
I've had sessions where the workshops function correctly and sessions where they do not. But usually, they do not.
---
It's a multi-level problem:
---
3. The  issue is inconsistent. You may join a server and find the icons are  what they should be. Additionally, the bug doesn't occur to all players  on the same server. This means when you are experiencing the bug,  Bethesda is putting you at a disadvantage compared to other players who  aren't.
---
The fact that it doesn't affect everyone indicates it is a bug.  So it may eventually get fixed. But don't hold your breath.
---
This saddens me :(
---
Im one of the people that preordered the game because i was expecting it to be good. Im just so disappointed at everything bethesdas doing
---
Did you keep hitting R to put the arrow away too? I find that is probably the biggest problem I have with the bow.
---
I played a match earlier for the "rank up" daily challenge. Team fill off. I didn't do anything other than hide in the bushes, ended up placing in the top 4, and got 600+ for the match.
---
The lining or the underarmor itself?  Remember the shielded lining is an improvement you make to the underarmor.  I however have not purchased both yet, so can't be sure that it's not bugged, just trying to troubleshoot.
---
If you save the 1500 atoms you get, for later ranks you could jump through the last 10 more quickly as well which cuts hours needed
---
And a puppy.
---
I wish all the mobs did that, it would make thinks more interesting
---
You get a bonus if you use strange in numbers. I used it on a team and was able to get +3 to all special
---
No one will get to rank 100 without spending more than those 500 atoms
---
what rank are you at just now?
---
There's no reason trying to talk with someone with the "oh, they lied to fuck us over" mentality.
---
It's bugged. 
---
The FAQ saying that you should get them from the event shows that, that's what it's intended to do. From their mouths. 
---
It's not happening. 
---
So it's a bug.
---
Not hard.
---
Yes this grind is just too much
---
Where’s the TLDR? Math is hard.
---
I'm sorry Sir, but your positivity and logic have no place here. /s
---
This will be hot fixed by tomorrow 🤣
---
There’s no homophobia in my post. Please stop trying to hate on a game that will always be loved. And second off I didn’t know this was a spelling contest dumbass. I’m typing on my phone there will be spelling errors stupidass. I’m allowed to say anything I want it’s called freedom of speech.
---
The game is a masterpiece and always will be a masterpiece. People like you fall into the toxic group of people that will never understand what bethesda the amazing company has made for us. People like you need help and need to go to a place (not reddit) to figure out your life and to not lash out over the internet. This is not good and you should be ashamed of yourself. You should stop being delusional and you would see that.
---
The only person that’s not level headed is you. You should be thankful for what you got and it seems like your not. 0 iq looking prick.
---
Everyone that downvoted are haters and should seek help. Including you. Stop hating on perfection. THATS THE PART THAT ISNT CLEVER. Maybe you should try and think level headed OH WAIT YOU CANT BECAUSE YOUR TOO BUSY HATING ON THIS MARVELOUS GAME dumbass
---
You can’t report me to the mods since I have not broken a single rule I am speaking my opinion and fighting for the perfect triple a title that bethesda has given us. If your gonna pull that card I will report you as well for being a bitch.
---
Start thinking before making your messages. Please seek the help that you need before hating on art over the internet because it’s not good to do.
---
Plus the narrative at the end goes out with a whimper. The whole gold vault secret service aspect is so poorly written and convoluted. 
---
Hell, I just finished Beckett's quest line today and the dialogue between him and his brother was some of the hackiest cornball highschool level drivel  in any fallout game. Face palmingly bad writing.
---
If it wasn't for the fallout license, these games would be considered dog shit euro jank.
---
Rank 4 I believe. Got the ammo converter yesterday
---
You’ll see the numbers change if it works
---
[Obligatory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fZZqDJXOVg)
---
thanks :)
---
Use either a new character or your lowest ranked one. I agree but as is that's the easiest way to do it.
---
thank you!
---
Yeah i know its a bit late but with thr introduction of this new battlepass thing with seasons it opened the doors of discussion again
---
from what it sounds like you'll need to technically move your camp like you would going to another location. then just build up again. you can blueprint all your buildings so it doesn't make it that difficult to rebuild
---
What people expected and what bethesda do aren't always aligned.
---
So far we're presuming each rank is 25pts more because thats what the first ~12 are (dont know if anyone has got further than 13-15).
---
We're presuming that each daily will add up to 2000 because thats what today's and yesterday's added up to.
---
We're presuming that the weeklies will be 7500 because that's what this weeks is.
---
We're presuming that for the next 10 weeks you can repeat 10k xp for 100 score because that's this weeks repeatable.
---
This is also presuming there's no double XP weekends, and nothing weird like meat week awarding score or something
---
Sure, but I dunno how much that matters to me at least. Scorchbeast, Scorchbeast Queen, whatever, they have the same attacks, do the same things, annoy me the same way. 
---
My first fight with a Scorchbeast was wild at like level 30 seemingly forever ago. By the time I hit the Scorchbeast Queen it was just another Scorchbeast to me with a bigger health bar. Likewise, killed a couple WCs and it's fun, no doubt. Giving one a bigger health bar doesn't _really_ feel like a "new boss" to me.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll play and enjoy and such, but I can totally see people not really counting this as totally new as well.
---
It’s a low level reward, and there’s a damn good chance that it was designed to help low level players that always see exactly how much ammo they have, and not for the high levels that each scorchbeast queen sandwiches for every lunch and have so much ammo that X/999 is burned into the corner of their screen. When I first started playing this back in 2018, I would’ve loved to have the ammo converter. Now, I just need to spend a few minutes in West Tek and Lucky Hole to get a few thousand rounds of whatever I need.
---
I don’t play Guild Wars. However, the model here is based on ‘participation during events is how you get rewards’. 
---
By your logic, there should be no end date for Meat Week, Fasnacht, the Halloween Event, or even the Mountaineer Outfit. 
---
Not everyone needs to get everything. Just because Guild Wars does it differently and apparently let’s people get all rewards all the time with no deadline doesn’t mean that’s valid here.
---
Not yet but essentially that's what I'm going for, only in a non obvious way  
---
Still looking for a location, guess it's gonna have to be near a body of water, which narrows potential locations a looooot
---
Hmmm... interesting way to look at it, i think you're on to something!
---
Agreed this completely helps griefers who try to 4v1 all the time already
---
“People who are willing to support false realities to validate their own narratives are a danger to themselves and others. “
---
Just quoting this for it’s relevancy outside of 76.
---
Then it wouldn't be a SEASON.
---
A lot of games are doing this. Making a Battlepass system that you rank up with an end date. This gives players a reason to invest time; to get the good rewards. This has a good effect on the game itself giving players a reason to play, increasing the player counts. So far, it's good if they fix a few bugs and add a few ways to earn.
---
Better One...

I just did all the weekly C.A.M.P objectives and didn't get anything for it. Also Im pretty sure I didn't credit for the 3 legendary kills which is always 'fun'..
---
Oh those fond memories of placing down a CAMP as close as possible to the meat week area and trying to kite liberators to it, get one of Grahm's pals in the line of fire so he'd aggro, and pray he went inside the build area of the CAMP so you could take a photo and get those sweet atoms.
---
So it's extremely grindy still, just not - that- extremely grindy?
---
DON'T STEAL MY TRADE SECRETS AND BUSINESS IDEAS. The Enya is just to *enhance your calm* though you can use that I recommend it.
---
That's the same one I usually share. An extra 5% XP is always a nice little boost.
---
Pretty sure this has happened to me today as well.
---
And I got 150 atoms yesterday. Seems like a win-win.
---
When you make a new armor set, then legendary perks that refer to armor class, and realize you didn’t assign a class to the new armor set 🙄
---
I think I'll just run a cowboy build with rifles and revolvers, the mutation thing you mentioned reminds me about the damage I'm missing out on and there's also that -50 gun accuracy penalty. Thanks for taking your time to write a great response, I really appreciate it.
---
Thank you for the response. Really. I'm being genuine. 
---
Normally Bethesda ignores posts like this.
---
Might be worth passing up to the team that maybe they should pay some consideration to PC players. You guys did very early on. Only once &amp; then all other requests that mostly benefit PC players have been ignored since.
---
Text chat (c'mon ESO has text chat for all platforms), anti-cheat for NW &amp; more prompt removal of hackers when reported multiple times, proper ultra-wide support that isn't just stretching out the elements, better key reassignment options &amp; so on.
---
This issue for PC players isn't a bug. It's a mask-off moment by Bethesda revealing a truth regarding Bethesda's attitude towards PC players.
---
Please pass this up to the team for their due consideration. At the very least we're going to see more PC players come through via game pass. At the very least try to cater to a growing segment of the market.
---
Thanks for your hard work as always.
---
It makes sense to me, simple mathematics. I cleared 6 levels in under 2.5 hrs last night! 
---
Yes things will obviously get harder as you progress, but 6 levels in 2.5 hrs it was a breeze. And I honestly don't care to team up with any one, but this system, has made it more enjoyable, I made the effort and actually like it. 
---
It gave  me something to work towards. Not to mention seeing one of the community managers playing last night jurring the SBQ fight made me happy, I felt like I am part of the bigger picture. 
---
All in all it was a good night. Other than the loud mouth brat, arguing with his mother about bedtime, and  screaming  and  screeching over the mic for over a half hour near the end of my session. 
---
It gave me hope after I was almost ready to walk away, after 3600hrs. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best! 😃
---
This isn't much different from what I've read around.. the general understanding is that you need to play every single day and you still come up short.
---
What people should be focusing on is the fact that SCORE for events is not working properly. I think with that distributing properly, it is a far more realistic grind. It's wild to me that there are fifty posts on the front page about the stupid ammo machine, and few to none about the fact that this isn't working like they clearly said it would on their site.
---
I found others but it was shit i didnt want so i scrapped them
---
Wow I didn’t even know that mate, thank you !!
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday but realised it had already giving me the score before I had completed the challenge. Few posts about this already but if you're indeed only rank 4 then maybe something is not right
---
Score earned by doing challenges not events. You get score from challenges involving doing events or getting xp and doing the 10k weekly repeatable besides (and other challenges as well).
---
That awkward moment when you didn't even remember that public evenets were supposed to give you score so you were just doing daily/weekly challenges and thought everything was fine lol
---
It’s still shit. You can’t even take a day off ffs otherwise you have to grind your ass off to make up for it.
---
Probably multiple friends sharing the account.
---
Yes, it still works. It was nerfed, not removed. This happened over a year ago.
---
You literally (and I mean literally!) don't have to play an mmo every day to get high end rewards.
---
I just looked, it's $28 CND...I think that's a good price. Go for it!
---
Everyone isn't meant to get everything, the more you play the more you get, but seasons are limited in length as they have to he, or they're not seasons. I'll likely not get past level 50 and I'm ok with that...
---
Get a load of Tenpenny over here!
---
My favorite part about the new little pop up, it says "Press ESC to Claim"...and it takes you to the damn game board instead of...oh, I don't know...CLAIMING IT to dismiss the message.
---
It's bugged for me and at least one other person on the RFN Discord.
---
We bought the (4/2/4) plan and learned it, and it applied one of the linings to our underarmor.  On mine, it applied the Treated version.  On his, it initially applied the Shielded version but on a subsequent login applied Resistant.
---
I went to a workbench and tried to apply the Mk5 version over the Treated one but it wouldn't let me.
---
On my next login, the underarmor is now the Resistant version and I checked with the other guy, and his loaded up with the Treated version most recently.
---
it's a piss take
---
Tyipical Bugthesda
---
If you're having fun, why do you care what he says? Or is it because his statements make you realize deep down inside that you're lying to yourself?  You seem awful upset by his "rant."
---
He wandered through my camp last night too. 
---
I know he has a set path but I've never seen him come through. I've been at the same place since before fasnacht.
---
I'm still waiting for the xbox live friends list bug fix. I've had multiple friends just up and quit playing due to the fact that some friends show up and others dont and only in this game. Yet the only BS fix Bethesda lists is "hard restart the xbox."
---
Based on how long this has been going on, they simply don't know how.
---
&gt; What does this mean?
---
&gt; If you do the challenges each day and manage to kill enough baddies to complete the weekly once per day, you WILL complete the legendary run.
---
Don't take a day off over the course of the next ten weeks boys and girls.
---
So easy to put a repeatable like 'Do 3 events': 100 score. Nah. Why.
---
IF you're going to release a giant grindfest challenge at LEAST release new content that isn't just cosmetic to complete along side the grindfest
---
Yeah, no way I’m playing NW
---
Honestly?  Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4. If you enjoy this setting and haven’t played those yet, that’s hundreds of hours of gameplay available.
---
I’ve also heard good things about The Forest but have no personal experience with that one.
---
Beckett worked for me today for the first time in weeks.
---
No but I loaded in at the Rusty Pick, left did some missions and quit my game at Whitesprings than on my next load in I was back at the Rusty pick. Only happened once and I thought maybe it didn't save any of my progess but it had.
---
So like the Queen is to regular SBs, this is like the... King? of Wendigo colossi?
---
Thanks. I didnt knew about not droping scrap. Until level 150 I ve never been a pacifist so far and always dealt some low damage by accident u know. And now I am, just in case. Anyway the best remedy to dont get ur camp destroyed  is Alt+F4. I prefer to be a coward than be killed by somene in God Mode.
---
Have the replied anywhere that it's not working as intended?
---
Thats what got me to stop playing destiny 2. The fact that they made the big point of seasons is the stupid pass and what they want you to do to grind it out then two weeks before they end it place a way to buy the last remaining tiers with money.
---
Everyone who plays video games are not live streamers with that youtube/twitch paycheck and game companies need to stop treating their playerbase like such. Also stop turning around a baiting the carrot at the end of the stick and slap a card reader with "options" to purchase or "not feel forced" to grind every single day to get all the nibbles off said carrot.
---
What really concerns me is that Bethesda abuses the psychological “Fear Of Missing Out” (or the element of impermanence in marketing terms) aspect - as a desperate way to push players to spend more atoms / real money. It’s either that - or waste your life on freaking grinding. 
---
In reality I think very little people will achieve to get where they want without needing some atoms. It’s no coincidence that the coolest stuff is at the end of the board, obviously.. We already payed 50-60€ for the game, we need to pay 15€ per month to actually have enough stash space. When the hell will it end Bethesda? Stop putting the knife against our throats will you? 
---
In the atomic shop the element of impermanence is also constantly being used to persuade us into buying stuff. It’s really uggly imo.
---
The point is to quit spreading bullshit and use some critical thinking skills. Sure maybe the system sucks, but you can provide evidence for that without making shit up.
---
Preach on!
---
You've excluded a chunk of possible earned points every week.
---
If people are doing ALL of the challenges to maximize their points that means they're doing  the level up challenge, and by doing that challenge they're also completing the repeatable experience challenge at the same time by default.  
---
If a player over level 100 is gaining the absolute minimum exp needed to level up exactly once a day then at 15880exp per level that means they'll have earned over 110000exp a week or enough to complete the challenge eleven times for an additional 1100 score points a week.
---
That means instead of earning a potential 21500 score a week you should be earning at minimum even without additional exp grinding 22600 a week.  At ten weeks that's 226000 or 6000 points more than you'd need to hit rank 100.
---
People keep excluding the repeatable challenge but you really can't ignore how those extra 100 points add up.
---
Theyre gonna release a new questline involving the brotherhood soon which is kinda cool but im just so turned off of the game because if how grindy it is
---
Except that for so many games, once you finish the content, you don’t keep grinding over and over. 
---
Why does OP want or feel the need to continue grinding if they’ve done everything in the game?
---
So the fact still stands, you have to grind out every day, every week, and not miss more than a few days. Plus you have to maximize all the buffs and constantly have them up in order to complete the Season without spending atoms. 
---
This is absurd.
---
I get a lot from ghouls.
---
Yeah its OKAY the idea is great but the execution is HORRIBLE.
---
Even if you’re not on PC, go to the 76 section of Nexus and look up TZMap. It’s a replacer for the one in game that’s up to date with the in-game world, and shows where all of the actual, current water is. There’s a few places on the vanilla map that show water but actually don’t (Lake Gad for one), and a few places that don’t show water but actually have it (like the giant lake in the middle of the Toxic Valley).
---
The point is to fix the misinformation? I don’t see at all what this has to do with OP showing off his math skills...
---
I fast traveled to Watoga and for some reason it loaded me in around  Grafton.
---
Because then they couldn't limit you with 2000 points.
---
I love the cowboy buildl that I have it's a lot of fun using a revolver and lever action.
---
Ohhhh it was nerfed not removed? Thank you everyone I asked was telling me it was removed
---
If they just streamlined the interface and let us convert ammo in greater quantities at once it'd be fine.
---
Love how the subplot is about miners vs robots, and here the players are expected to be both. 
---
*I owe my soul to the company stoooooore* 🎶
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering. 
---
Best of luck.
---
I guess maybe they know people rely on selling ammo for caps so they made it a less appealing option?
---
This. I usually don't even pick missiles up and if I do on accident I drop them first chance I get.
---
Now I *might* pick them up or keep them just to convert. It's still a self punishing endeavor, but only a little bit.
---
Playing every day isn't natural. My internet was out this morning and I spent an inordinate amount of time today wondering if it would be on by the time I got home/would be able to do dailies. And this is day 2 lol. 
---
If the score required isn't capped they don't want you to take a vacation and if you get hit by a major hurricane or something you're screwed.
---
found the spot. thx alot.
---
Lol I was preparing to comment “it just works” but you beat me to it.
---
In the new season format, the max Atoms you can get from daily/weekly challenges is 1500 in 10 weeks. With the old daily/weekly challenge system, you could potentially earn over 6000 Atoms in 10 weeks. It's a **huge** nerf to Atoms.
---
that wasn't my point but ok.
---
&gt;Do you complain that when playing Monopoly that you only get 200 for passing go?
---
there's a difference between design mechanics and artificial limitations. case in point: Fo4 didn't have a daily caps limit.
---
&gt;Considering that everyone plays by the same limits, it is fair.
---
I never argued it wasn't. like I said you missed my point.
---
&gt;It feels like your complaint is that Bethesda doesn't want you getting everything in one go,
---
&gt;while you feel entitled to get everything you want, now.
---
&gt;some things take time, patience and work to get.
---
&gt;Just because someone wants something, doesn't mean they are entitled to get it.
---
huh. funny how it worked for Fo4 tho 🤔
---
I get Fo76 is in a different game category altogether, but at the same time it isn't. Bethesda advertised it as "you can play however you want" and tried to please everyone with a mmo-light. well, I'm not pleased. and neither are a lot of people who expected actual private servers so they didn't have to play by Bethesda's stupid limitations. which, by the way, are the very definition of anti-consumer. it's got mobile monetization scheme written all over it. no different than Blizzard forcefully limiting people's playtime in WoW as to keep them subscribed. it doesn't add to the game at all, it's not a mechanic like your monopoly example. it's just a way to get players to log back in daily, check the atom shop and renew their Fo1st subscription.
---
THAT's my point.
---
&gt;but reality shows that while there may occasionally be setbacks, development is flowing ever forward to a better end result.
---
"occasional", nice joke. reality is that they break multiple things with every new patch. things that aren't even related to the fixes. and after a whole year, what did we get? wastelanders? half a dozen fetch quests full of bugs? wow, you're absolutely right. it's flowing somewhere alright. *at a snail's pace* at that.
---
&gt;I have been in software development positions in the past. With something as involved as 76, there are certain to be unforeseen ramifications to the changes that are made.
---
and I'm fairly familiar with the CK. while I can't comment on the online portion of the code, I have enough knowledge of the inner workings of gamebryo to tell you they're just incompetent. hell, you don't need a degree in game development to design a better ammo converter. it's just baffling. something always goes sideways with Fo76, conveniently enough. most triple-A games manage to just work for the most part, but not 76. *I guess the game is just THAT "involved", huh?*
---
&gt;We must remember, those at Bethesda, are simply people. They are doing their jobs, to make a game, and continue to improve it. Cut them some slack.
---
they're doing a poor job, though. factually so, irony-charged post aside. and I don't cut incompetent people slack. I refuse to cut the guy who took almost 2 years to fix the robot and shadowed mod entries any slack, considering that's something I could've done in 5 minutes using 3rd party, fan-made tools. while the person with the source code can't manage it without breaking several other mechanics in the process. the latest gauss weaponry F up illustrates this perfectly, the team behind the game is clearly not cut out for the job.
---
*Cave Cricket Colossus has entered the chat*
---
Well it'll cost you.... One new ps4 friend. :)
---
What, shutting down vendors for a month and a half because there were three separate dupes all involving the vending machine is good? Nuh uh.
---
Yes I agree with you but the values are all skewed 350 points for 12 rounds. It’s so underwhelming much like a lot of items that Bethesda launches
---
Usually when a large portion of the community complain about something, they're on the money
---
I beyond hate the ammo converter like the pricing sucks and worse of all I could make ammo that I don’t need or even really need better than I can with that damn converter
---
make a new toon, and bush wookie 1 game. it's what im doing right now
---
If i was going to make it you would load it and wait an hour or two for it to break down into components and then let the user craft it.
---
I appreciate the heads up. I’m clearly new at this.
---
Well this will only work if the dailies and weeklies actually give you the score reward. 
---
Already had 2 weeklies not give me the rewards and I was tracking them. I had 1 lamp to make, made it and it shows completed but im still at the same rank and same score. 
---
How hard is it to make this work? Apparently very difficult.
---
not even close at least so far the numbers from exchange is good to me as melee but the UI is horrendous, makes almost a work to exchange, they can polish that and will be all good.
---
It's pretty terrible.  Even from a software developers view.  The interface is just bad
---
When has any update they released not been a disaster or led to one? They are staying consistent. We need to understand that this is the best they can do, they can't get things to run so smoothly we don't even notice and as usual they will ignore any complaints about people not getting score or challenges being bugged AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR 18 MONTHS and release the next "season" on time and just as broken.
---
This is from the patch notes. 
---
Accumulate enough S.C.O.R.E. points to rank up to level 100, or advance by spending 150 Atoms per level starting July 14. Get Atoms now or earn them as a reward when you rank up during Season 1.
---
DON’T use your atoms unless you wait til the end and get desperate. Spend 150 atoms at level 10 is a joke if you can spend the same atoms at level 90 when it take wayyyy more points.
---
Its the generation of fake news
---
First encounter with a colossus was solo, since I was farming Sundew Grove for fluorescent. Dude was _tough_. Made me use up all my ultracite plasma cores _and_ about 2000 2mm EC.
---
Honestly your fault for letting a video game have such a big impact on your day to day thinking. There’s not some blood contract that says you HAVE to grind every bit of endgame content. Just play something else.
---
Two shot was nerfed from +100% damage to +25% on the second bullet. Explosive was nerfed from +100% to +35%. 
---
The Demo perk was nerfed at the same time from level 5 max of 100% Damage to Max +60% Damage.
---
Additionally as more helpful info: Demolition works on any Launcher, Grenades, or Explosive Bullet weapons. Heavy Gunner only works on Heavy Guns that are not launchers, but can have the Explosive Bullet legendary effect.
---
Welcome to freemium monetisation games where the goal is to Intentionally not provide you with the best the game coulbe &amp; sell you the thing that makes the game unbearable &amp; unfun
---
If it screams your character will run away for a short period of time.
---
I did think of that but the only problem is whenever they talked it was the same person saying the same thing. And even if they didn't talk they played the same. And they used to camp in the same parts of the map (which made them easy to find a kill). Might have just survived on 5 and a bit hours sleep. 
---
I mean it is possible they had like shifts and i used to only catch their shift.
---
It was free, so I won't complain.....much. Othere than converting missiles or maybe energy cells, I probably won't use it much. I'd rather drop or give away what i don't want/need than go through the hassle.
---
Yup, all the countless calculation posts work on current assumptions based on what we know. And they should be treated based on that. Also, I don't think  we're going all the way to September without a double XP event.
---
I'm glad someone else can see the light in seasons. Made a post the other day and while it was nowhere near as cohesive as this is, it was neutral at best with people wanting to believe that it was just flat out horrible. Some people even saying that spending atoms on the board is exactly what bethesda wants so that you have to spend more money on actual atoms for atomic shop items. A good majority of people, at least from the scrap boxes that I see at camps, are fallout 1st members, and seeing as the board literally gives you the atoms you need to skip the last 10 levels, it's not as doom and gloom as everyone makes it out to be. 10 weeks is multiple 1st payouts of atoms, which you can also throw into the board if you wanted to for more level skips, but you don't even have to do that.
---
Oh no that sucks man im sorry to hear that. This is the first time experiencing or even knowing about it. Im assuming its a rare bug..?
---
Also, sidenote, i wish i could play video games with my grandad!
---
Agreed, heavy guns here
---
I’d rather not make 1 just for a single daily. But I’m probably goin to have too at this rate
---
Be nice if we could bulk ammo.
---
Before P20, sure it wasn’t as common but more and more people are talking about it.
---
This isn't much of a grind. I completed yesterday's in 20 mins. And I completed today's in about the same time. I guess if you look at it in the sense that you pretty much have to play 20 minutes a day - then yeah it's a "grind" in that sense. But in time needed to complete the tasks - this us virtually nothing compared to most games with a similar system.
---
Weekly challenges are bugged but not in a way that makes them not work. Some complete 5 challenges actually award the Score points at 3 instead of 5. A lot of people had this happen, myself included.
---
So it'll work for my BE plasma gat?
---
He follows a pre-set route. It’s likely that your camp is along that route. If you Google ‘Grahm’s Route’ you should find it. Then compare it to where you are.
---
I think it is super clunky but you shouldnt get downvoted for thinking otherwise, if you are enjoying it even a little bit I think you should be free to express that
---
I was hoping to trade in my ammo for ammo components to make other ammo. Not sure why they didn’t do that
---
Has anyone generated a list of which events are giving S.C.O.R.E. points? 
---
\- Scorched Earth:  1,000 S.C.O.R.E.
---
\- All other  **!**  quests?
---
I assume public events = all  **!**  quests that you can fast travel for free, and which give treasury points too. Is this correct?
---
Fuck. Seeing the legendary perks in the trailer, I have a sinking feeling that Bethesda won't do much at all with changing the perks.
---
That is *currently* true, because getting SCORE from events is broken.
---
Wonder if you pay for the pass
---
Yea it's a shame you can't get some extra score from the events though and not just the 100 repeatable xp score. Even if it's just 25 for easy events 50 medium and 100 hard
---
You the real mvp
---
I bought this game full price 2 months ago. I know at least 3 others who paid full price in the past month or so as well... and we are all on xbox.
---
Also stated in the post is that if you don't spend the 1500 atoms gained from the board, you can skip the last 10 levels. Which for most people who won't buy their way to 100 as soon as the restriction is lifted, will probably be close to week 9, assuming you have the patience, there is more than enough time.
---
the problem is not the converter itself but rather how stupid and counter-intuitive the UI is.
---
yeah, I was expecting Bethesda to F me over with a 5:1 conversation ratio, gotta keep players logging back in daily somehow. but was there really a need to make it so cumbersome? are they that desperate to keep me online?
---
Scorched have .38 a lot of the time especially at the airport area. 
---
If you have lots of lead and steel it’s easy to make especially if you have ammo smith
---
No. They're usually quite slow with coming out with information that could easily stop a wildfire of speculation.
---
Either it's a bug, or as suggested by /u/Xevious_Red in another post, that the repeatable weekly will rotate between XP and doing Public Events. Or the people making the FAQ misunderstood what the game designers/developers said.
---
This. If you catch the flu and can't play for a week post-Rank 70 you are never catching up. It's as simple as that really and that's where the dissatisfaction comes from. But sure, we'll make it about the maths being wrong, even if we still come to the conclusion that you can't miss even a single daily without having to grind massively or spend Atoms. At least most posters in the thread have the sense to point out and realise this.
---
as long as I don't have to see links to shady business and porn sites :)
---
lmao i can see people writing “add me on discord for b2525 handmade $100”
---
16 Is very annoying, on xb1x I spawn in sometimes 10 seconds later than everyone else every game, enough time for someone to completely loot the area I spawned in.
---
Ok I follow now. Sorry I don’t play much NW so I was under a different impression regarding armour skins.
---
Every update just reinforces my "conspiracy theory" that Bethesda is Vault Tec or really wants to be. Every bug &amp; glitch, i.e. potentially programmed button lag to prevent button spamming, are all part of the experiments that the Vaults are/were/will be known for. What can they put the dweller/player through before breaking. 
---
I spent 5 hours playing guitar &amp; wearing a bear suit sitting at Whitesprings giving away plans from the gifts &amp; pails. I had a lot of fun, helped out quite a few people and didn't earn a single XP. 
---
I know that doesn't help everyone to fully enjoy playing this game but on a serious note, this game works well for the wife &amp; I. We've been playing side by side since Fallout 4 &amp; then 76 beta.  She is immunocompromised and barely leaves the house for the past 2 years.  This game has been her main source of social interaction since it's release. We have made several friends while playing and really enjoy those times. 
---
We like to help newer players get outfitted &amp; upgraded.  I  can't count how many times we have bought a single 5mm (or other) round for 3-6k, just to help someone out. 
---
In fact, just discussing this post and what I'm responding here with makes the wife want to jump in the wasteland &amp; play.  Some of us really enjoy this crazy game of resource &amp; expectation management.
---
My favourite experience today was joining multiple “event” groups who never joined any events and now I’ve read your comment they probably just used me for exp 😆
---
It's been mentioned a few times.
---
Tested it somewhat extensively. Dunno what triggers it but yeah, challenged sometimes pop and give you score when you complete x/y but then you also won't gain xp when you reach y/y.
---
Didn't make sense what i was sometimes seeing, but then math adds up to what it should be, no lost score no extra score - lots of events.  
---
Question is though, SHOULD public events be giving out score? I personally would like that, 10k xp for a 100 is nice and all, but some events have so little reason to participate in as they are now.
---
I appreciate their enthusiasm. I miss that
---
Yup. That's what got me killed. 
---
That's the problem you solve after literally one test. Like so many of these issues, they are boilerplate obvious. You don't implement this kind of stuff if you're testing it, which they obviously aren't.
---
That's all it takes. Today's was level up in NW. Hide in the bush, made some coffee, enjoyed some fresh air *oh look it's done*. NW challenges will likely be some of the easiest to accomplish.
---
The screenshot should be proof enough, one of the missing ones only ticks off if you complete all the other ones first!
---
Go back 1 screen after buying or selling will eliminate some steps.
---
They are lazy. 
---
- Tons of new bugs
---
- Nothing was properly tested for quality
---
- Old bugs arent fixed
---
- Content is very shallow
---
They announce big updates, but the truth is, its repeatable boring stuff, very limited.
---
So it's really not much different from grinding in NW to get bonuses.
---
Oh sorry I didn’t notice
---
Those games are nothing like fallout 76, that's my main problem.  all the previous games were amazing, this is quite a let down overall and has likely killed the future of the franchise.
---
Think nw armor is different from the adventure mode armour that's why the skin won't work. Nw Armor is one piece where adventure modes is 6 different pieces so even though both a Armors look the same they are different entities meaning the skins will never work in nuclear winter.
---
Sounds like you used them.
---
Don’t you give them ideas
---
There’s a really nice ledge or two close to the main action points you maybe want to utilize. Find it, go tag the ugly bastard and run back and jump on it. You can then shoot him in said ugly face, with nothing but his blood curdling screams to haunt you.
---
Doubtful. They seem intent on repeating their mistakes, because some people on insist on handing them all of their money.
---
its meant as a time sink for the SCORE system considering how long it takes to convert unwanted ammo. they also can stop hearing about the argument to scrap or sell unwanted ammo to protectron vendors
---
Nope. They have not said a word. Which leads me to believe it is working as intended. Cause if it isn’t, telling people they should also get score by doing events would calm some people down. But how do you spin, “yep, you gotta do all the dailies and weeklies and at least 10k experience every day to get all 100 levels” when people are upset about that?
---
What is your build? When I was level 20-30 I could easily kill a wendigo. Might have been power armor but I don't know.
---
Best bet I can tell you is set mines or just pop some chems and pray. Could also try to get help from a friend or someone in a public team.
---
Yes. Demo Expert, Heavy Gunners, and any other damage increasing perks or consumables. Adrenaline perk however is not working from last update.
---
I don't, I just think its sad the way the game has declined.
---
Haha maybe, touché.
---
are you sure you didn't just accidentally convert .45 instead? an hour is a long time of repetitive, menial task.
---
Here's how I rationalized it...
---
We have a base of 1000 points per level. We start at level 1, so we're only earning 99 levels. That makes the total base 1000 \* 99 = 99,000.
---
The formula for adding all number from 1 to *n* together is: *n* (*n* \+ 1) / 2
---
However, the first earned level starts at 1000, so we only need to apply the 25 increase for 98 levels. That makes our formula 98 (98 + 1) / 2 x 25 = 121,275
---
121,275 + 99,000 = 220,275
---
I also wrote a quick loop function in javascript to confirm. #nerd
---
Example of what I'll be running post update 20: [Bloodied Commando / Team build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f345db&amp;d=sg2s01eu0eh1pi2pp2ph2pg2p01pq0la2lu2lt2l71ir2ib1a30a00a12an2ar0ao0a51a70ce0cm0cu1&amp;m=05142c9f3b&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%20%2F%20Team)
---
I run with a mix of explosive and energy weapons (some of those explosive as well)
---
Although Adrenaline is broken at the moment... with 1 pt you would get +36% damage (max), so I'm giving up +24% damage in the worst case by not maxing it out. The Bloodied damage output is high enough as is that I don't really miss it, and can put the 4 points elsewhere.
---
For SBQ Tenderizer comes in handy, and I'll rotate that from 1 to 3 pts depending on what else I've decided to stack in there (suppressor, strange in numbers, etc.). I also switch to a high fire rate heavy weapon when she lands for the "magic" effect as it's still a thing.
---
I went to atlas and there was a note saying he'd be back in a little bit, and that he went to get supplies. I want to know when this new quest happens.
---
This. People are far too quick to play devils advocate for a corporation that has invented the problem/made it restrictive so they can sell you a solution.
---
Can Bethesda just pop in and clear this up for us? They're silent on everything.
---
They do provide score points. The reason you think your not getting any is that you get the points before you complete the challenge. 
---
When I get to 3/5 on some of the challenges it gave me the score provided however once I fully completed it the challenge does not give the reward because you already received it.
---
This happened to me with most of all the weekly challeneges.
---
How long have you been playing 76? And have you played the older fallout games?
---
That fix would be great. SCORE points from events could help ease the grind otherwise its every day and even some xp farm for the whole run.
---
The hell do you need that much ammo for?
---
I carry like 4-5k just from pickups and honestly I think I need to dump some because I never run low
---
&gt;I don't think everyone should expect to conveniently get 100% completion on something like this
---
why not? am i supposed to be punished by bethesda because i dont have the time they want me to have? i bought their game already, why ***shouldnt***     i be able to get it conveniently at my own pace?
---
I’m sure, you have to spend your ammo points before you can convert anymore to points
---
Doing the new daily/weekly challenges will periodically grant you a bunch of Atoms (150).
---
They share a lot of similarities. I’ve played them all. The combat system is virtually identical, as well as the general aesthetics and layouts. 
---
You’re not going to find a clone. 
---
And if you dislike this game so much, why would you want to find one just like it?
---
I saw someone yesterday mention they had the same trouble
---
Very true.
---
People have accepted this dull roll and repeat gameplay as the new normal, which is why I have such a hard time getting through to people.
---
They are known to give you the SCORE early (e.g. when you get 3/5). Have you done some quick calculations to see your rank on the board, and how many challenges you have completed? For simplicity in the first ranks, consider that you need 1000 for each tile on the board and then see how much you should have gotten from the weeklies. You'd easily see if you're 3 000 off. It added up for me.
---
Continuously, I noticed it lot of the times specially when traveling to a friend
---
Got nothing to add as it’s exactly how it feels to me.
---
I loved the time of Wild Appalachia -  nukashine questline, the grind for scout badges, the lying Lowe questline with the encrypted event and finally the introduction of sheepsquatch with some random encounter hints leading to it. Not to mention of Fasnacht the first seasonal event for a certain period.
---
The pace of each grind, timewise as its rewards were totally manageable and fitted into the base game we had before.
---
Only thing they’ve messed up back then and kept it were daily and weekly challenges.
---
Nope I'm afraid its not that way for me.
---
Just figured this out today and will be running it during this season pass thing.
---
I turned in close to 300 .38 rounds and was able to get a whopping...wait for it... 24 .45 rounds. Really? And they have  the audacity to call this a “converter”. These are some third world country exchange rates mannn. I’d  be better off continuing to just sell all my unused ammo and then use the caps to buy the kind I want from someone’s personal vendor
---
This would be great but with the super duper perk it would throw the numbers out. Cooking 100 whatever with a 30% chance of double could mean you end up with 200 as opposed to applying the perk to each instance individually
---
Since launch and yes.
---
My first encounter with sbq I wasted so many shells trying to cripple her, then switched to a sniper rifle doing barely anything, then unloaded my almost thousand rounds of 5.56 ammo. I didn’t get credit for the kill. So since then I make sure to waste as much ammo as I can when I fight her
---
Its good to buy ammo you need, maybe a nuisance to use but I had 240 grenade launcher ammo taking a boat load of stash space but couldn't find it in me to just toss it. used it all to get ammo for my plasma caster that I just unlocked.
---
I should've looked that up first, I have absolutely been wondering why I would occasionally get a random 1k SCORE for no reason. Thanks stranger.
---
Ok i think we just disagree, no need to discuss this any further.
---
"Awesome, after work I'm going to login and help rebuild it."
---
*Gets home, logs in, Atlas already built day 1
---
"Oh, right..."
---
same issue here. have to hit esc to leave the menu as tab stops working just before you would return to the map.
---
Yeah. I hit up the Penitentiary or Grafton Steel some and scrap all those weapons to make my own a lot. (Scrapper perk) Thanks for the suggestion!
---
OP, it's fine that you're raising awareness but you gotta come to the table being willing to stop your sub &amp; stop playing the game.
---
That's what it took for a response and "compensation" with the vendor/display case issue (and the free bundle we got was cynical lazy recolours of existing models).
---
It's very clear by now, Bethesda only responds to threats to the revenue. Are you willing to stop your 1st sub until this issue is addressed? Will you encourage others to do the same?
---
If not, good luck seeing any changes to 1st.
---
Check again. It's in the atom store, so assuming it should work in nw is perfectly reasonable
---
Well some people are mad at Bethesda for no reason and want to make stuff up. Been happening since launch, it’s still happening now
---
I'm having this same issue, my dude. Hasn't said anything since I found him a few days ago. He's the only one not working. Frustrating AF.
---
I just spam space, it remembers your last choices, that speeds it up a bit. But I don’t really understand why they didn’t go for the workbench/vendor type of interface.
---
Oh no I think you are thinking of the community bos event coming up, thats more of a donate supplies to help build for the bos return. These were described to be more like objectives in certain dungeons that golive rewards for doing them.
---
Bonding and Best Friends Forever (BFF)
---
That doesn’t change the fact that I lost 4000 .45 ammo instead of gaining 400
---
I agree. Its going in the wrong direction. I dont much care about new cosmetics which is 90% what this games about it seems
---
Oh alright thanks man
---
All good.
---
I'm just happy for some new content, as a casual who keeps playing even though I'm level 110.  I just like the game, I guess.
---
I know. but maybe you accidentally hovered over .45 instead of 10mm when selling and didn't notice, and then just bought more .45.
---
they sell for the same price I think.
---
Today has 6x250 and 1x500 for a total of 2,000.
---
plasma fusion, 5 per queen then Cooper run to make more 5 and stack till the next queen, I wouldn't need those if she landed more.
---
How are Epic the only one's who aren't totally inept when it comes to implementing a "pass"? Every game that tries this either makes it laughably quick or a monotonous grind.. It also doesn't help that Bethesda managed to put this out with bugs (me and others haven't gotten points for dailies) which is hopelessly funny.
---
I have a very precise camp placement up a specific large tree, honestly ide rather just deal without it then rebuild it.
---
No worries always happy to help
---
The sad thing is the model is great. It even has a custom animation to go along with it. Some modeller clearly tried to make something interesting and inspired, but then once it was time to put it in game someone just went "idk, just slap a default terminal to the side of it and use the crappy terminal UI, the stuff it into a random SCORE reward instead of actually implementing it properly in game". It's the type of UI you'd expect to see in a really bad mod, not from the actual people who made the game
---
And the actual values, like what? Has the person who programmed it even played the game? Why does it even have a point limit?
---
There is fuel. Is mislabeled as 10mm under energy.
---
I dont think this will happen any time soon if at all. Its the reason why 90% of people even subscribe to fo1st
---
What's wrong with deathclawsgonewild.com?
---
Wondering if Game Pass PC players will play with others from Bethesda and Steam or by themselves.
---
Then with all due respect, you should move on. There are a lot of great games or other things to do besides FO76. 
---
That’s not meant to be dismissive. It’s meant to be supportive. No one should continue doing something that they don’t enjoy, **especially** if it’s voluntary. 
---
If you just needed to vent, then hopefully you got it out of your system. Because even as a Fallout fan for 20+ years now, and knowing this game could be better, I’m not about to let any investment of time and energy make me feel like I have to stick with something that’s no longer any fun. 
---
*That’s why I divorced my first two wives. They stopped being fun.* ;)
---
Christ... Can't the mods just make a fucking sticky for the ammo converter already?
---
Seasons is good and bad. I think it's too much grinding for the amount of time given to us. They should add an additional week at minimum as a buffer for non-hardcore players. (Keep in mind, this is coming from someone that has played almost daily since Dec 2018)
---
You do ultracite ammo yet?  Ooooh.
---
Well everyone I know is getting the points listed even though they have reported they are having the same problem as me. 
---
It’s hard to believe since most of these things people yell about here are just half truths.
---
Man and i was using Fo76 to rest from Destiny 2, guess i will need to find somethin else
---
I’ll log in again in a few minutes. But when I did them before all I had was a NW daily, kill a legendary, build 5 decorations and collect 3 pure water.
---
Edit; well that’s another massive cause for concern. I logged at approx 1700 BST and was greeted by 4 dailies.
---
I did the three non-NW ones and then did some events for XP.
---
I log on again now and more challenges show up so either they weren’t available from the start or my game bugged.
---
Fair enough. I replied to your other post. 
---
Feel free to walk away and find something that brings you joy. 
---
Life’s too short to worry about this shit, kid.
---
2400 hours for me.
---
Which of the fallouts have been your favourite?
---
Mine's fallout 4. Which is strange as it's the most similar to 76.
---
Todd don't know about devs one thing. They don't play a game actually. Why pay them?
---
Yesterday I saw a level 35 and 45 in the watoga train station, thinking they where actually about, didn't buy them because my luck would be I didn't have enough caps to get a l50 when I found one... Absolutely no luck!! If anyone wants to make me a level 50 for 1500 caps, I wouldn't object.
---
This was happening to me before update 20 I was thinking that we normal
---
They basically became that in 76 when Maxson refused to use the solution to the scorchbeast problem
---
Yes, happened to me twice already. 2000 points never to be seen again.
---
The entire game desperately needs a “create max” option
---
Me he
---
O
---
Ok too mi it 8pi
---
Just lost 1000.. its so annoying...
---
Im bugged too guys wtf
---
&gt;The biggest joke at this point is the PTS. You have these people doing hours of mundane, repetitive troubleshooting and spin the narrative to make them think they should be grateful to be volunteering for paid QA work (you don’t even give them a month of 1st for each month they participate!?) Where is all this money you’re saving from these volunteers, and making off subscriptions and micro transactions going? Why are we surprised that people doing paid work for free aren’t producing the quality of paid workers?
---
Dude, I agree with you &amp; even you're missing the point. The worst of it is having all these people provide feedback &amp; bug reports &amp; it falling onto deaf ears.
---
I've given up on helping out with the pts.
---
The waistland is your storage, develop good junk collection routs and you don’t need to store anything.
---
There’s full hp vampires, beserkers and other builds, bloodied and junkies aren’t the only two lol
---
Intriguing 🤔 That is an interesting question.
---
lol this is a fantastic bug, of course it's mislabeled as 10mm under energy.
---
Yay, your playstyle allows that. Me, I have to try to make one of those challenges every day. I have to stay far longer than I would if I wasn’t trying to get those points. It is not a mountain out of a molehill. It’s ridiculous even if you didn’t need to do the repeatable just for being unforgiving about missing one daily or weekly. And having to do the NW challenges. Which is just trying to force some people to play a type of game they absolutely hate!
---
You mean the hack they fixed right away and only affected one server? I'm all for pointing out flaws in a game, but being afraid of something that can't happen is pretty misplaced.
---
If your actually referring to "Dailies" as in the Daily challenges and not the weekly ones, I can't say this is the same. However, Weekly challenges are bugged but they still work, if one says to complete 5 of something, it actually completes at 3 and awards the points then. If you go all the way to 5 nothing will happen and it will give the illusion that you have gotten nothing. This happened to me and others but actually the points just show up but most people assume it was for something else instead of the challenge they were working on.
---
Crickets are tough SOBs. Don't feel too bad. There are some enemies that you have to stop whatever else you are doing just to kill them. Ants, mirelurk hunters and kings, and yes, crickets, are on that list.
---
But don't let that keep you from coming to Scorched Earth. It's a lot of fun!
---
I just want games to be made by nerds again. Ill be playing cyberpunk when that arrives. So there's that to look forward to.
---
I havent read it yet. I dont play melee so it isnt all that useful to me. Im not sure yet what Ill do with it. I might hang onto it until I get another "all 3 alive" and hopefully get the stimpak diffuser plan and then decide. I had thought up until yesterday that all 3 alive at the end would have been next to impossible but it felt easy this time. Lots of high players and everyone split into groups and spread out. Sure some of the animals didnt rank up far but i think sometimes the actual game makes it hard to achieve that regardless of player effort
---
I was buying .45 not 10mm.
---
No doubt. Did Census Violence and Im usually the only one doing it solo. Next thing I knew there was like 15 people there. It was nuts. Being high level and not really needing anything, I just stood back and let everyone else have the fun.
---
I could not even find the missiles xD xD so j just tossed them back on the ground like usual xD
---
Tattered field jacket, camo jumpsuit, responder fireman outfit
---
I use it as a glorified fidget spinner.
---
Part of why this is sad is because this seems so easy to implement.  In addition to C) Fav add L)Lock and it can't be sold or scrapped unless unlocked.  The Borderlands 3 Locked/Unlocked model is a reference.  The Letters, Numbers, and Punctuation tricks work most of the time, but there's so much loot to scrap and the UI lag is so consistently bad, that I scrap something I regret about once every 2 months.
---
Skeet shooter perk and a combat shotgun. When you ADS it has the range/accuracy of a rifle. Firing from above, he undoubtedly was getting x2 headshot dmg with each pellet.
---
I completed 2 weeklies and they didn't give me the score reward. 
---
I was tracking them both and seeing my progression. Neither have me the score reward that was to be given. 
---
Xbox one.
---
I know there's a location where you can build into one of those trenches you find throughout the area but outside of that I'm not sure. 
---
A base glitched under the map is always an option to of course.
---
Horribly disappointing. Scrapping ammo and building new ammo would be better than this conglomeration OF BS. (If it was a thing)
---
1 guy at BGS sitting in his tighty whiteys at home sipping milk laughing his ass off because they allowed his broke ass idea into the game.
---
I’m guessing it has to do with the bos content. When you’re up in the toxic valley there’s a new brotherhood of steel radio broadcast
---
I like the ritual bindings they’re nice
---
My first weekly I completed it but I did not get the score points. Not sure why it didn't pop up but it got the check mark.
---
Im from the US. My personal preference on “when its right to grill” has nothing to do with this post. I personally dont care when anyone grills and I grill whenever its nice. Regardless, its still shown as a “Summer” thing to do. Hence the theme for Meat Week.
---
Since the update my character has somehow been missing critical shots, those aren't supposed to miss right?
---
Known glitch but it's also been said you can enjoy the bonus rewards while they're available. You're not at risk of losing them if you snatch them up now.
---
That’s exactly what they should have done. Put 100 .38 in and get like 2 lead, 5 steel, and 1 gunpowder.
---
100% I tried my friend.... I couldn't find anywhere in the actual Bog that didnt get belted. Even the fringes get SB's.
---
I'd suggest looking at the mountain ridge sorta south of the monorail elevator thing. I've seen some cool ponds and mini lakes and didnt have to kill too many things as I passed through. 
---
There's a lead resource in a crevasse type area which is also above an acid node too. Not *quite* in the bog though but on the border.
---
they have been closing threads for it and downvote you to hell
---
I like this, I miss making level 2's go crazy with gifts when the free week was available
---
Bethesda doesn't really care about gamers like you and me anymore. They want the gamer that says "do I need them? Yes. Do I want them? Yes. Do I have the time to earn them? No, so I'll spend all my money on atoms to buy them."
---
Or perhaps in a weird turn of events, they'll be matched with Xbox players.
---
The likely scenario is like Steam they'll play with others on PC. Pretty sure Steam lets you play with Bethesda players so it should probably just work like that.
---
There's tons of low level events or go back to your main character. Score isn't tied to one character.
---
server stability. is why it has an 800lb cap
---
It's fine, I just don't want to get drawn into an argument.
---
Real life is shit, i dont want games to become shit too!
---
I don't think I excluded the XP score, so much as stated that we need more data to understand how much different people can farm. It's hard to say "You'll get X amount in 10 weeks" right now. 
---
My argument is that simply doing the challenges, as you mention, should be enough to get the 5000 you'd be short if you otherwise only farmed challenges. But I also mentioned that with an optimized farming setup it would possibly shave off a fair bit.
---
I have loaded in stuck under a friends base and loggged out and back into the same server and loaded in in a random spot. Only happened once so far though.
---
I know. what I'm saying is, you're selling 10mm right? but boredom gets the best out of you. and without noticing you hover over .45, selling some of it instead of 10mm. except you don't notice it because .45 sells for the same as 10mm.
---
New player in the past 30 days, rolled a BE 50cal finally.  Everything else has been total trash though.
---
And there’s double xp weekends a shit
---
That one does show a lot of promise. I played CyberPunk back in the day and it’s always held a special place in my heart.
---
What's up with the plasma caster
---
Yep, you need to log in and play a lot of you want full completion, that much is sure.
---
Maybe they deserve it though. 
---
OP can you honestly expect Bethesda to do any different with future games like Starfield or Elder Scrolls VI?
---
There may be a more experienced &amp; competent studio at the helm but do you think they monetary practices won't be as predatory? That they'll be as responsive to dealing with bugs &amp; desperately needed features?
---
Something to think over while you take a break from Bethesda.
---
Travelling Leather coat and Leather coat and Winter Jean's and jacket
---
Thanks for telling me that we won’t lose em!
---
Glad it’s not just me. Guess people are only focusing on the ammo converter though
---
The inconsistent flow of the game, number of clicks, and load screens are what get me some times. Ward feckin knows I’m gunna get his bone saw. Are you telling me he can’t radio the quest to me on the jukebox I have attached to my feckin arm!?
---
Does anyone else suffer from the stuck in crafting animation? That one MURDERS ME.
---
they force players to pay for 1st. And they dont really care about the people that havent got the money to buy it. They only think about money on this stage of the game.
---
I particularly enjoy having to press b 96 times to exit. Solid craftsmanship
---
Just a head's up. That lead+acid camp spot is very popular, and if you use it you'll often have trouble finding a world where that area is vacant and your camp can be placed.
---
It's amazing how consistently bad they are at communications. It's not hard. Our CMs are presumably trained at it, and have probably taken college classes on effective communications. Heck, it's something most people learn about in high school. 
---
So why are they bad at it? Is it intentional? Is it really that much of a circus at Bethesda that the communicators don't know what's happening until after we ask about it? They certainly burn through goodwill at an alarming pace.
---
You could not pay me enough to be a CM/PR person for this organization. They have to eat shit from the community *and* the company.
---
What happened to a little attention to detail &amp; not blindly spamming the sell key?
---
Same the robots one didn’t give me anything and my husband didn’t get anything for the robots or build camp stuff
---
Seems glitchy, got score for vital equipment, but not retirement plan.....
---
if you only have room for 2 guns and the rest is bulked scrap then the problem lies with you. 
---
As someone who always hoards in games it was hard to stop picking up every single thing in the game. You don't need any more than 30-50 of each common scrap. 
---
Sell or dump excess junk. Turn stuff into bullets. It gets to a certain point where you just need to keep some stuff for repairing your armour and weapons.
---
Thats funny cuz i was playin borderlands before it happened lol
---
No argument, really. Just some direct and sincere advice
---
&gt; I don’t care what the newest shiny particle effect item is and I am not going to chase it.
---
Was it FFXIV?
---
I see where you're coming from...a girls gotta have hope tho. If they ruined the next elder scrolls game...I'd be done for sure.
---
Inspiration xp bonus is nice now due to the fact you get score points faster due to the increased xp. I used to never use this perk because once you get high enough level it doesn’t matter no more.
---
Then they need to do somthing about the servers. The new content needs server stability too so they need to fix there servers in general
---
I have done all but the nw challenges every day. Plus I always do biv and I do the mr fuzzy token quests plus settler quests. I still have to go out of my way and play much longer than I would naturally to get that 10k. The person you are replying to is right, not all playstyles gather xp all that easily (I also go for a stealth build like him but I prefer sniper rifles).
---
Same thing happened to me on xbox
---
Wasn’t there an ammo converter/scrapper as reward for vault 94 raids? Where did that one go?
---
I’d have to do every challenge every day to hit close to the tier 100? Who’s playing this game that much?
---
I've seen him spawn after I died and then just bug out and start fist fighting a ghoul.
---
Maybe the mysterious savior and the mysterious stranger are the same guy but he just forgot what roll he was supposed to be playing when he showed up to help.
---
&gt;  the general understanding is that you need to play every single day and you still come up short.
---
My post is that if you play every single day and do all the challenges you will not come up short. So that's pretty different, even though in both cases there's a lot of logging and playing involved.
---
But yea, the bugged stuff needs to be addressed ASAP.
---
Not even just the people who can only play once a week, those people might not be reasonable in expecting to get 100% completion on a season pass.
---
I'm thinking about people who can play 4-5 days a week, and still won't be able to get to 100% without spending atoms.
---
Its a completely bogus system, and I'm super fucking bummed that it turned out to be so fucking shitty when I had been so hyped for it. 
---
I paid $60 for this game, and I also pay $100 a year for a subscription, and for that I'm given pretty much nothing with any real value except the fucking stash box that IMO everyone should have as a baseline feature in a game about collecting and crafting. To be clear I **only** pay for first for the stash box, I would never pay a penny for any of the other things you get with first including atoms.
---
Its fucked that this is the thing that's got me wanting to stop playing completely after putting up with everything else since launch.
---
All I know is I didn't play yesterday, I can't play today, and tomorrow is unlikely as well, so basically my chances of completing this event are already looking pretty fucked and its only a day old. But hey, maybe Bethesda will tweak things and make this suck less, maybe events are supposed to give SCORE but are broken? 
---
Fingers crossed I guess?
---
To be fair, their qa team aka the PTS are telling them. They're just ignoring the feedback
---
I mean that blackbird paint would look SO GOOD on the t-65
---
There are culverts under the road in places, where you can build.
---
You might also try building up in one of the monorail carriages, although SBs can still destroy stuff you place inside them.
---
Dude I feel really bad for you guys. I hope I didn’t insinuate that you guys aren’t meeting their crazy demands because I did not mean it that way whatsoever
---
I have to agree that the way they set it up is terrible and there is no point in trying to sell mass amounts of ammo or even buying it because you are losing so much through it.
---
It does have its uses like with big explosives missiles, mini nukes, and 40 mm grenades. They take up a load of space and its just wasteful to drop those. You can sell them for an ok amount of points and get some ammo. Its not good but its better than taking up space trying to sell them to other players or just flat out dropping them.
---
(Noticed that you can't look at the screen when in power armor which is a huge pain)
---
It wouldn't be hard to just add another screen to go through Sell Ammo&gt; Which ammo&gt; How many sets of # of ammo (Ex. Sell Ammo&gt; 5.56 &gt; How many sets of 20 would you like to sell.)
---
Also changing the amount you can buy for amount of points. It should still cost something to be able to change one ammo type to another but it shouldn't be so pricey as it is now. Its not even worth bothering with unless you are just getting rid of ammo for space.
---
*You don't need every cosmetic dude*. Seasons hasn't killed anything and I'd feel safe suggesting these items will appear in the ATX once the next season rolls over, probably on sale even.
---
Play when you want to and I think you'll be surprised what you naturally unlock on the fly.
---
inspirational and strange in numbers
---
I got the Red Rocket skin on it - looks like Iron Man
---
You don't need gunsmith, just participate in the scorched earth event when it pops up or run the silo yourself (obviously don't use the intended path) and you'll end up with too many improved repair kits to use.
---
That's an enormous help, thanks so much!
---
Why do so many people just complain about this game?
---
Coolest thing i've read all day.    And i'll join your merry band of melters...
---
^This. Yeah apologies I meant to say that too. However the two ponds more towards the bog I've rarely seen built on.
---
Full west tek got me maybe 4000 xp. And why should I go for a build I don’t enjoy to earn the points? The point of the game is to have fun, not force myself to do stuff I don’t enjoy. That’s what work is for and that is why they pay me actual money to work.
---
I know. My issue is that after the season's over, *that's it*. There's *no* way to get it. Ever. And this turns the grind to finishing it into a punishment for failing to do so.
---
I mean the skins that don’t change the model. I love how the thing looks, I just want to put like the nuka cola dark and the nuka shine paint on it.
---
Oh no, I didn't get that sense at all. We have common intent. Just saying the situation is even worse than your take.
---
Oh no, might be a common issue then. Hopefully we'll get an answer, I'll reply to you if someone comments with a fix. But seems unlikely :(
---
Did you ever get this done?
---
This has garnered le upvote
---
I didn’t know you could get them from events. I’ll try and do that later
---
Guild Wars 2
---
Do you think that way about the limited time events like Meat Week and Faschnaut and all the holiday stuff?
---
I still barely use my gauss shotgun because of this, too many missed shots with expensive ammo. I seem to have a hard time hitting SBQ, even on the ground too. I've noticed entering, exiting, and entering vats helps, not sure if anyone from bethesda has ever responded to this issue yet tho.
---
Strange in numbers, tenderizer, suppressor, inspirational. Plenty of perks, had a guy sharing the bandolier perk but it was useless to me as I was using a melee build and didn’t really need it.
---
It’s possible they were rewarded early. Multiple of my dailies gave score 3/5 of the way through
---
Who was doing the buy out and of what, sorry, I'm a little confused.
---
You don't see your own bond bar
---
Or maybe they find things they like about the game and don’t want to see it go so bad they can’t enjoy it anymore. I find the people who complain the most about something are those that care about it.
---
My only question is: Where is the ammo converter public team? We need buffs for this slow, grindy p.o.s.  
---
Sarcasm aside, it’s shit and I’m just not gonna use it.
---
Quick question - if I completed my dailies (2*) and my weeklies already. Where should I be on the board. I feel like a two of my weeklies didn’t proc- camp building and finding different junk .   sCoRE 11/100 975/1250 . I hit my experience repeatable probably5 times  not too certain about that though .
---
TLDR: You can complete the season within the time they allow (10 weeks) by doing all of the challenges every day, and there are a few ways to alleviate the grind.
---
From there it's open season if you think the requirement is too much or in some way problematic.
---
Yeah I managed to get everything I found was really easy to do and gave 20 to 40 atoms. Lots are just getting 76 of everything which is funny
---
Yep, if I make it far enough that's exactly what I'll be doing.
---
Even if there wasnt enough days to get all the score you need, beth would obviously do something about it by the end
---
The sad thing is theirs too many whales and sheep that wont listen and will throw money at them no matter what, so they will continue going down this road. And when they stop throwing money they will just end support for this half baked game.
---
No I clearly states that I sold .38
---

---
Because it's more of an incentive for players who are dedicated to the game, mostly. That's how I see ALL battlepasses. It's not something you just buy and expect to have done by playing casually. 
---
It's an investment so that you can have stuff others don't through your hard work. If everyone can just blaze past it, what's the point of even having it?
---
Wanting it to be brainlessly easy to obtain things takes away the only incentive to even try to grind for it and takes away any sense of accomplishment, to me personally at least. 
---
I can see why that's annoying to casual players, but I at least want SOME sign that the time and effort put into this game is at least worth it. Especially for a completely free battlepass, which isn't the standard in the industry.
---
Why was it removed?
---
Enjoy it if you want, it's your game too.
---
Grind out lead, steel and gunpowder and make it. 
---
West Tek/Huntersville/satellite array for super mutants. They drop gunpowder, and break their guns down with scrapper for steel.
---
Lucky Hole mine with excavator armor for all the lead you’ll need. You’ll need acid to break it down and smelt it.
---
Get acid from the rail station East of Watoga. Server hop and farm snallygasters.
---
Make sure to get super duper and ammosmith.
---
This is an endgame strategy assuming your level 50 minimum.
---
The suit still cannot be repaired don’t want to wear mine because I don’t want the health to go down
---
No, but my other teammates see theirs.
---
They don’t see mine though.
---
Then donate tons of money to them. It costs quite a bit of money to run servers. This is why they have fallout first so this revenue can help pay for the servers and develop new content for the game.
---
The atom shop before fallout first was not really making much revenue to support the game via servers and content due to the fact atoms were abundant to players doing weekly and dailies. So there were no need to buy atoms.
---
They could probably add it as a daily in the next season
---
Me as well, even a matte black paint would be ab improvement.
---
I've seen a bunch of posts from people saying they didn't get score from challenges, so it seems like an ongoing bug. I believe I saw a Bethesda rep acknowledge it yesterday-- we may be in a 'wait and see' position, but I suspect there will be some redress.
---
It is too much. This games season is played out where if you miss a few days, you have no chance of getting the max rank. Seasons are in every other game have it where you have ample time to get max rank, to the point where you can miss a few weeks and still get it. This game is encouraging players who miss a few days to buy atoms to complete it. That's fucked
---
Once I spawned in, hit a yellow box to immediately get shot and downed and thirsted by another player on the roof looking down on me while the entire rest of my team (all 3) were still loading into the game and not even spawned in yet.  Even with an SSD, there's still others than spawn in faster 100% of the time on xbox.
---
There's no cash in that my friend. Beth is a business, and once those desperate for the seasons skins have paid their way across the board, when no longer in vogue they will be put in the ATX as the company spent time and staff making them and people will want them. They know that, and it's what I'd do to maximise the profit off the item. It serves noone to have it appear once and never be seen again. 
---
It's not a prick act by Beth whatsoever, it's literally how all of business works. Ive got nearly all of my atx stuff by waiting barely a few weeks after release and it's all discounted. Heck look at the wastelanders extra content (settlers etc) that shit was like 40% off or more only a couple months later.

I’m glad they’re putting a skin in the season thing, but I mean just gimme da skins

People can't see their own bond bar, because you can't bond with yourself. It already counts you towards your bond total. As long as it's saying x4 you should be good
---
About the same amount of hours here spread over 3 accounts. I'd say Fallout 3. I preferred the atmosphere of it. Everything was dank and moody, like a post apocalyptic wasteland should be. I felt the took a step in the wrong direction with 4 and removing the karma system as it forced you into playing the good guy. There were some shady bits but in 3 I nuked a town, murdered everyone who paid me to do it and made a fortune from human trafficking. I know 76 has some cartoonish elements but then all the older games had quirky shit. You could find Doctor Who's Tardis in one of them. Even NV had Indianna Jones in a fridge. The frustrating thing with 76 is it often shows the potential to be the best of the lot.

Thanks for the info
---
I've seen this argument a lot, and idk.
---
The whole point of online games like 76 is that new content is always getting added, it's the reason people keep playing them instead of just finishing them and immediately uninstalling like typical single player games. Sure you don't *have to* grind anything, but almost every piece of new content Bethesda adds to 76 either has grindy aspects or is entirely locked behind grind, so if you choose not to grind, you basically have nothing to do after finishing the main story/wastelanders besides aimlessly wandering around
---
We want to play more, there's just nothing to do but grind. That's why people are so disappointed, because almost everything bethesda is doing is just adding in more things to grind. It's easy to say "well just don't play it if you don't like it", but people are allowed to wish for something better
---
This is true. All of the people I know have the same issue you listed. They do get the points.
---
I hope all this no points half truths people are throwing around don’t give Bethesda the wrong idea as to what’s wrong with challenges.
---
&gt; This season pass is garbage and you trying to put it in a positive light has just done the opposite for me.
---
Telling facts is trying to put it in a positive light? Jesus christ I fear for the future of humanity if you guys are scared of critical thinking.
---
Yep, there's a copper deposit and oil seep (not together) near those ponds, and I've camped on both without any issue.
---
I love the area, because it has great views, it's relatively free of enemies, and it offers cheap fast travel to both Foundation and most areas of the Bog.
---
Really not sure how anyone in the studio office thought it was going to be a great idea to add another grind on top of the Wastelander's grind. Whoever made these decisions is clearly a sadist.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJwmP20hsMQ) is the clip I watched. Shows a few other tips too
---
I don't care about the atom value. I care about value. So let's discuss your argument.
---
"Overall atom value" isn't real. As a made up currency by Bethesda it is directly controlled by Bethesda how valuable it is. And I'll prove it using Bethesda's own exploitative system.
---
Paint skins 800 atoms per vault tec armor paint, right? Weapon paints are usually 400. Outfits like suits are usually 300 or 500
---
The vault tec starter bundle for 1500 atoms comes with 3 armor paints, 3 weapon paints, and 2 outfits(just reskins of a suit tho). That's ludicrous in terms of "atom value" Bethesda would be losing around 2700 atoms per purchase. But they know noone will ever use all those things, so they package in it in a bundle. So if you would have bought a combat armor paint and a laser paint, that would be 1200. But they can wrest out a few more atoms in the bundle because people think that they're saving money by paying for stuff they'll never use.
---
Think about it, once you hit combat armor you won't use leather or metal. Your build also is focused on one to two types of weapons. And outfits cover up armor paints anyways. So if you really wanted something you probably wouldn't have even used most of the other stuff.
---
So let's see what is available in seasons: Player iconx3 Armor skin Pip-boy skin Clean sink Ammo Converter Chicken coop Ghillie for 1. Wood 2. Leather 3. Metal 4. Combat 5. Back pack 6. Robot 7. Scout 8. Marine 9. Secret service
---
Flatwoods skin bow Ghillie hunting rifle Blood eagle sledge Dark Matter Combat Rifle Appalachian Thunder Pipe(Gatling) Blood eagle Handmade

---
Space suit• Blue • Pink • Green
---
So "atom value of all the other rewards": doesn't matter. I couldn't give less of a damn. You know why? There is no consistency. A power armor retexture sells for 800 atoms but a bundle of 4 sells for 1800. So what does that mean? Do the power armors from seasons cost 5600 atoms or 3150? Neither because I'll never touch them.
---
Let's go back to the vault tec thing. Three armor retexture, three weapon retexes, and two outfit Reskins. This one has 9 outfit reskins 5 weapon reskins (and one unique skin for gatling) then 3 outfit reskins (that you don't even get until after 95) but here's the thing. The vault bundle could be more valuable than all of that. Let's say you're an energy build with secret service armor. If you get to rank 82 you can equip ghillie on your secret service armor. Good work. That will take roughly 8 weeks of your time for a single armor skin you want. Or you could spend less than three weeks to buy the vault tec bundle. You won't get USSS armor. But your outfit blocks out your armor skin anyways and you can actually equip a weapon skin on your laser rifle. Therefore you got two skins you actually used at the end of the day.
---
Almost every skin you get is from a retexture. You won't even get unique meshes until about the 80s.
---
Let's do another thought experiment: You want that Cosmos Power armor and main literally any of the 54 weapons, other than the 6 skins available. That's 88 ranks. Almost 9 weeks of grind, and if you miss one day that's another 200,000 xp you have to grind. Why? For a single set of (admittedly very high quality) power armor cosmetics.
---
Now let's say in the old system: a single suit of uniquely meshed armor is 1400 caps. Guess what? Less than 3 weeks of grind again. Nearly a third of the time.
---
But hell, let's be charitable to the new system. Let's say you can exchange "atom equivalences" from "something you would have bought anyways" fuck it. In this scenario you use power armor so I'll only count those for the sake of being fair.
---
By rank 28 you will have gotten 2 power armor retextures for low-level power armors t-45, and t-51. At 800 atoms a pop you could instead buy the Captain Cosmos for 1400 and have 200 atoms left over. This skin you would still be able to use even after you've outgrown your t-51.
---
Hell, let's be extra nice and say it's actually based on "relative atom value" of bundles. You hit 4 retextures by 48. About 5 weeks that'd be equivalent to an 1800 atom bundle, to buy a cosmos you'd have 400 caps left over(enough for a weapon/outfit). You get to x01 by 58 let's say that's the *real* cut off because most bundles go to x01. That's 6 weeks or so. 1800 atoms, 400 left over.
---
Even with all of these concessions I made. It would still take three less weeks to get the cosmonaut given "atom value of other rewards" then what it actually takes. Despite many players using t65 now and never actually touching 45,51, 65, or X01 skins again. But they *have to play* through 8-9 weeks of utter trite in order to get something useful.
---
Energy weapon mains and unarmed builds don't even get a single weapon skin out of the whole ordeal. Many people don't even use power armor and some *only* use power armor so they're being forced into a slog for a handful of cosmetics with 80% or so they won't use.
---
Yet you sit there with the *gall* to say people would have but enough of this stuff anyways to justify it?
---
Well guess what? No, I would not have spent 5000 atoms on the stuff available here to make the new system worth it.
---
I don't use power armor, I have a full secret service set, and I am built around unarmed.
---
Meaning the only things I would buy are space outfits and the Secret Service ghillie. Even using highest estimations (1000 atoms each) that would put me at around 2000 atoms. Less than 4 weeks of the old grind. But Bethesda likes releasing things at a fake discount to trick people into buying so it probably would have been even less than that.
---
So why should I waste 81 or so ranks just to get one item?
---
So tell me. What would you have wasted you money on over the course of 12 weeks that makes the 5000 lost atoms worth it?
---
Some of them are even easier than you may think. Like the weapon mods. IIRC (unless they patched it) the Combat Knife has two ‘No Mods’. Switching between them counter as nodding the weapon. 
---
For a lot of those there’s cheap/fast/easy way to knock them out. 
---
For the repair gear ones, I would buy damaged low level gear from anyone (players or vendors). Then patch it up and scrap it down. I’d repair found gear before scrapping it for parts. 
---
Look for ‘loopholes’ like that. The robot combat ones are also pretty easy (at least the early ones) if you just switch weapons around.
---
System?

---
i uninstalled. i've had enough of games that make me feel like i have to log in each day, to the point that i just don't play games like that anymore, i wish i hadn't bought the game in the first place at this point and i wouldn't have if i'd known that seasons were right around the corner.
---
I don't think so. Some weapons seem to have more problems with it than others though.
---
I got this bug when i tried to use AC in Power Armor. Without it working... ughm.. ~~fine~~ (well at least you'll be able to use it).
---
They coulda just did a workbench for ammo conversion, but NOOOOOOOO. 
---
Its like Nintendo Americas leadership in the 80s i swear.
---
why would you drop your weapon when it's laggy? Or why would you drop it for any reason? Like. Sorry you lost it but.. why would you do that? Why not just leave instead of dropping?
---
You on PC this is a huge problem currently....for me. Had to switch from my gauss junkie back to my double barrell junkie shotty the gauss shotgun is unuseable in vats for me.
---
I think if I manage to grind this out, I'll never want to play again
---
I'd rather have paid for DLC and gotten a game experience that doesn't feel like a second job.
---
With the added buffs of teams I’ve leveled up 5 times since yesterday, it usually takes me 2 days to level up but woah
---
Aye. It's fairly epic when it happens.
---
I did this and it still doesn't give me a quest. I'll try beckett instead see if it works with him instead.
---
Looks like I got the points for this afterall...they registered like 45 min after, while i was crafting ammo. Seems like some sort of delay.
---
Well certainly a smart move to drop a weapon when everything else is lagging already.
---
Not sure we're supposed to....
---
I wish I was recording but [plays.tv](https://plays.tv) stopped working a while ago. I did back on the beat, and that gave me score... The hardest was getting the right junk for aluminum.
---
could be people haven't quite noticed or it isn't affecting everyone, but is is bloody annoying.
---
no victim blaming on my part, I absolutely despise Bethesda's netcode and the SBQ fight is notoriously laggy, but you did just about everything you could possibly do wrong.
---
don't reload manually during the fight. if your weapon jams, stop moving and wait. don't switch weapons during the fight. try to avoid breaking your weapons or using repair kits during the fight. and above all, **do not drop anything**.
---
it's a joke that we have to tiptoe around Bethesda's incompetence but it is what it is. when you unequip something, or when your weapon breaks (or your repair it), it "stops existing" for a moment while the game moves it around. and if the server loses the packet telling to put it back, poof, it's gone.
---
the reload key being the same as the drop key also means that sometimes the game will drop whatever's highlighted in your pipboy when you reload your weapon, even if you don't have your pipboy open.
---
I very nearly couldn't do this, but by luck has decided I would wait to level my final alt up a few months back for fear of burning out. My other 4 characters are 50+ and 2 of them 100+.
---
really? gw2 has it's issues but one of the main factors that the casual playerbase loves so much is that you can take extended breaks (because you have to, the content release schedule is far too slow and far too light on the content) and come back without having to grind for new gear or anything, it's one of the issues i've had with the game; i want to play it but there simply isn't enough to do unless you enjoy farming some mindless achievements in the poorly written story episodes
---
Selling them by mistake is a thing from which people can recover if you notice before you hop off.  Even the Scrip machine lets you buy it back for the same cost - I've done it more than once, but never after fast traveling.
---
Scrap is unrecoverable.  The combination of the need to scrap many items that do not stack (e.g. weapons for steel and plans) and the delay so often encountered at a workbench is what is frustrating.
---
It was in the middle of the queen event. I was with my friends to. I couldent just leave. Plus i was in a stressful situation, the plasma was my only weapon that did alot of damage to the queen. I thought if i droped it and picked it back up...it would work again.
---
If you get to rank 76 in legendary run there’s a t65 skin that I think looks kinda cool
---
i mean you’re not wrong bro i dont know why you got downvoted
---
You probably completed a challenge (depending on the amount of SCORE you received it was probably the earn XP one) when you finished vital equipment, as quests don't actually reward score at all. Neither do events at the moment.
---
It's time to D-D-D-Duel!
---
Nice try Todd.
---
Shhh
---
It's nice to know I'm not the only person who games with both my mom 62 and my son 14...lol...my mom has always been more of a diablo type rpg player. Rather than fps shooter/RPGs.
---
If you really feel this way I would recomend to ignore the "new content" and just keep doing your thing. You don't really need to do any of it. Enjoy your gaming experience. The public team are a GREAT addition I didn't even know I wanted. And I bet that they fit great with your playstyle.
---
It’s fucking shit
---
My best suggestion would be switch on damage numbers and go shoot her with both. I'd be more inclined towards the AA, even though it's ropey on energy weapons as it's consistent.
---
Lmao when bethesda would rather make shill accounts then fix the actual problem
---
Try the vendor bot in Watoga, he might have it, or check the Enclave and the Whitesprings vendors. Not sure about plans, but there's a decent chance they might have the mod for it.

---
Bethesda have acknowledged the bug, chances are you received the SCORE earlier and didn't realise or attributed the gain to something else. You can confirm by doing some maths and checking your rank, depending on how many weekly challenges you have completed, you can basically expect atleast 1 rank per weekly, so with all the weeklies and the first set of dailies completed most people should be around rank 10 or 11.
---
I had to delete a level 50 alt to do it.
---
Yeah it sucks. Not worth it at all.
---
Jesus Christ this is not what I expected as a response
---
It would be cool if they had a chest that displayed atomic shop items similar to the way borderlands displays weapons in a loot chest
---
Both herd mentality and empath are highly underrated
---
I just think at this time, games will split between those who have a dedicated base who play more than most adults work, and games for working adults like myself.
---
I dont think its controversial to say its unfair to expect daily or damn near daily play to reach a max reward.
---
Bethesda is just very scared of 76 losing luster before they can get enough juice for their squeeze.
---
Personally shit like this speaks to a tone deaf design or a company leveraging best rewards in exchange to players dedicating all their gaming time and then some to 76 exclusively.
---
I'm not very confident in Bethesda as a whole and admittedtly do not expect much from them at this point beyond what we see from companies like EA.
---
In the air? what do you use when she lands?
---
Fr tho I really like it
---
You can make a new character and get 3 levels in one Event (not exactly, but you know)
---
people can smell you lies, Todd.
---
What does empath do
---
Today we got 'math', yesterday we had 'alt-math'
---
True but he would start calling you a liar anyone who kicks off over a shovel can't be reasoned with lol
---
I actually completed one of the weekly challenges (I believe it was the camp building one) and received no SCORE points whatsoever. I’m currently only tier 12 and I’m owed tier 13. So it’s hard to calculate the exact amount of points earned per week especially when Bethesda can’t get their shit together and stuff like this happens.
---
because Bethesda is not that smart. they are not EA or Activision.
---
because if they were smart, they would have known that the Ammo converter's UI is fucking awful.
---
Follow me around, I drop .38s all the time.
---
There's quite a few side benefits to public teams, even if you dont care about legendary run;
---
More XP: Useful if needing to lv up (low level, or missing perk card)
---
More SPECIAL: Get better prices from more CHR, or better skill checks. Herd Mutation always works.
---
Better Mutations: Strange in numbers perk card.
---
More Perks: Shared cards 
---
Charisma cards actually doing things (bodyguard etc)
---
Easier fast travel: now there's more camps/survival tents you can fast travel to for free
---
People actually showing up to project paradise.
---
Free caps: You get caps when team mates complete quests. Its not a lot, but its free!
---
Cool. see you when the next DLC comes out.
---
&gt;It's an investment so that you can have stuff others don't through your hard work
---
It sounds like when ea said lootboxes are good cus they give a sense of accomplishment. They dont, and neither does this. Its a chore, i dont feel accomplished when i got something for atoms that i grinded for. I diddnt win them, or earn them, i logged in daily to get 50 a day. I felt accomplished getting 1000 gold from vault 79 because that was a quest, and i felt accomplished because i actually did something, and not just grinded.
---
&gt;Because it's more of an incentive for players who are dedicated to the game, mostly. That's how I see ALL battlepasses. It's not something you just buy and expect to have done by playing casually. 
---
I bought each battlepass in fortnite since season 4 (when the game was still good) and got to at least tier 75 each season, getting 100 in most of them. Why? Because the main source of tiers were weekly challenges that were NOT time limited, like these ones. U could log in on the last day, play w4 hours straight, and if ur good or lucky enough, u can get to a high tier. Probably not 100, but defienieteley 70s, and thats without dailys, level up tiers, and bonus event challenges
---
Ok having run a dozen public events I can say it is inconsistent.  SOMETIMES I gain SCORE on a team and other times I do not.  Note I am accounting for all weeklies and dailies when determining this. I have no idea why I get it sometimes rather than others but I am getting it.
---
I got it once from Radiation Rumble and twice from Scorched Earth but did not get it the other time I did radiation rumble and three SBQs.  I had more scavengers alive in the RR that did not reward SCORE than the one that did.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
time to equip your nerd rage card
---
I'm up to level 10 in 2 days so I'm thinking it's going to work out OK
---
It's not just .38, I'm trying to convert thousands of energy cells, .44, .45, 10mm, shotgun shells, and other misc ammo on multiple characters. I only get so much time to actually play the game, I shouldn't have to spend most of it clicking through multiple screens just to convert 1/1000th of the ammo I have and then go through the same process to produce the ammo I want. My main uses heavy weapons and unless Bethesda puts in a mailing system so I can send the rest to a a brand new character then this was in concept going to be the best solution. Vending it requires build limit which I rarely have and there's no guarantee on if someone will come by and buy the ammo because Bethesda couldn't have designed a system that allowed us to simply sell bulk amounts of ammo for one set price.   
---
This was a terrible design that obviously had little to no q/a testing or feedback done on it because it wasn't put on the pts. Even if you're only trying to convert say 200 bullets the ui is incredibly clunky compared to some of the other system designs we already have in the game that could have worked. Hell, they could have copied the legendary scrip machine design, allowed you to just put ammo in and have it give you back the bulk ammo scrap that we would get from the Vault 94 raids. A concept like that would have been quick, simple, efficient, and then the player has the choice to craft whatever they wanted with the resources. Someone on the team for a AAA game company signed off on this design though and now we're stuck with it until they consider changes likely a couple of major patches from now.   
---
You can't seriously tell me that the developers thought all the people who've been playing since release wouldn't need to convert thousands of rounds of ammo and that the player base would be fine with a design that could only handle a handful of bullets at a time. They sure as hell don't make you jump through as many hoops to buy a large bundle of atoms, now do they?
---
looks like you got downvoted by some crack addicts lol
---
completely agree, fuck seasons, i wish they'd go die with every other shitty trend in gaming, alas, they won't.
---
I understand. I started a new character, and tried to join up with a team. Got kicked so fast the first time.
---
Second attempt, I played with the same team for three hours. The bonds are what matters more than who you play with, if that makes sense - if you wreck on your main, you don’t need a powerful ally per se...you’d rather have the buffs.
---
TL;DR: What dude above me said. :)
---
1. Responder Fireman
---
2. Camo Jumpsuit
---
3. Tattered Field Jacket
---
4. Leather Coat
---
5. Traveling Leather Coat
---
6. BOS Jumpsuit
---
7. White Powder Jumpsuit
---
8. Pirate, Long/Short Halloween Suit
---
Mr. Fuzzy and Whitespring Jumpsuits were two of the most sought after but duper’s fucked up Mr Fuzzy and Bethesda fucked up the Whitespring by making it a drop in the Halloween event.
---
That’s exactly it. The event related challenges award your SCORE before they’re complete.
---
I had to do it 3 or 4 times swapping between punk and gramps and then all of a sudden it said something like ally: lucky find failed. Then it gave me a new one
---
Supposedly you take more dmg and ur teammates take 25% less dmg. 33 less with strange in numbers, but it really makes you take less dmg too as long as you have 1 other teammate
---
I have mixed feelings on the grind. I completely agree with the sentiment that it shouldn’t be easy to get to rank 100 and that it should be a genuine accomplishment, but as a completion whore who also only has a few hours a week, tops, to play, I wish there were other ways to earn more SCORE. 
---
That being said, this being their first go at the season system and it lasting 10 weeks, I wouldn’t be shocked to see Bethesda tinker with available SCORE options, or add in some other mechanics to open up the season system a bit more.
---
I’m still getting AP negatives for thirst as of two hours ago...
---
Why do I need a converter when I can sell my extra ammo and buy then ones I need in vending? Never even built it when I received this award. Knew it was trash when it leaked with the conversion rates!!
---
They fixed the workshops so they’re now the same as pre patch. I’m happy again!
---
I noticed the first 2 supply crates are identical despite the first being small, and the second being medium.
---
Yeah I’m excited about that but that makes literally two different looks for the t-65 and that’s it. There are bigger issues with the game obviously but if they could just allocate a few people to make the skins in the game already fit the t-65 it’s be great. It’d also get me to spend my 5000 atoms im saving.
---
Thanks. I've been stuck in this terminal since yesterday.
---
Just take a break, come back when there is more content that tickles your fancy.
---
The pink suit was an atom shop item.
---
Inst/exp/something primed LMG. If I dont lag it does crazy amounts of damage.
---
they are not smart or competent but their greed rivals that of EA and Activision. i think they know the UI is awful, they just don't care.
---
I just made the simple assumption that due to its obtuse defense it would be heavy.
---
I know it was a dumb move, but you shouldn't blame me. The only reason i lost it was beacuse of the Severe game lad during thr event.
---
Ngl, you sound a little depressed. It happens bud, hope you feel better
---
At the same time I bought this game on release and only like one other person I know irl even plays and I haven’t seen him on in months.
---
I completed the daily in like 30 mins yesterday(no NW), and then the entire weekly plus the NW daily in less than 3 hours, while also doing the stuff I usually do when I play(also completed the 10k XP weekly twice), then I read someone on Discord complain about the season requiring you to play like 5 hours a day to complete it, wtf.
---
The challenges have been(so far) easier than the similar old ones which gave atoms.
---
The pink suit was a free atom shop a while back.
---
When I play fallout4 I don't have to play hours every single day for over a month straight to get the best power armor in the game. The plasma caster, Secret Service armor, Solar armor, Guass minigun, Guass shotgun, t65, strangler heart, ect are all locked behind month long grinds and aren't just pointless cosmetic items. As much as people cry IT'S AN MMO IT'S FINE FOR THINGS TO BE GRINDY, this game is nothing like a typical MMO. It looks like fallout4, it plays like fallout4, It is fallout4, but now instead it has a terrible grind on top of it.
---
That’s still a huge grind and is terrible. It assumes everyone can play every single day, because challenges are the only way to earn score. So it makes it impossible for people who can’t play everyday to earn score. Plus if you are playing to get every possible reward you are grinding every imaginable challenge and xp farm just to complete it. BAD MATH has nothing to do with it being a terrible system. For example I only have a few hours every day after work and probably only 2 to play games. I don’t want to spend my whole time on one game just to miss out on the end rewards. Then on the days off where I could grind it you are limited to only doing the dailies meaning it’s impossible to catch up.
---
Oh c'mon now, what are the odds of someone catching the flu or getting sick or something? It's not like the world is in the middle of a pandemic or anything... :/
---
Honestly the ally quests are awful, Sofia's isn't any better. The actual stories are okay at best by fallout standards, but the quests themselves are horrible. "Go to this arbitrary location and loot this arbitrary item/kill this arbitrary enemy with very loose explaination. Repeat ~20 times". The fact that bethesda felt the need to include a literal progress bar to show you how close you were to being done is all you need to know really
---
Plus the fact that those ally quests are literally the only side quests added with wastelanders. I enjoyed the story quests but it felt really disappointing to find out those story quests were the only thing there.
---
“Just” 🤣 Seriously though, good to know in a pinch but I’m not building until they fix it
---
Yup, I signed up once to get the atoms and the armour set. Haven't singed up again since. I might if they add something good to the subscription again but it'll definitely be 1 month with auto renew turned off.
---
you on xbox. ps or PC?
---
I don’t see a problem. There is a 70% chance that you don’t get any bonus items at all, so the stakes are simply increased with greater rewards.
---
I don't think that's true.
---
I don't see why menus would lag servers at all.
---
The creation, deletion, or movement of data in large quantities would.
---
It has to be a safeguard from being able to spam the server.
---
Found some off a super mutant at the array
---
PC
---
I've lost 2 weeks of weekly challenges and 7 days of daily challenges to this bug, that they couldn't hotfix and waited until they removed Atom challenges, and they couldn't even fix it?!
---
If you play in a team? Then I suppose lone wanderer would be useless to you. So I would use/keep tenderizer. And if you are content with 1 point in endurance, I would keep fireproof. If you have the dense mod on your chest piece(when you’re out of power armor). Or, you could get rid of the 3 points in perception (that you’re  using for concentrated fire) and put 2 in endurance to max out fire proof. Or if you don’t really team up very often, I would move those points to charisma for lone wanderer. The 20% less damage is something, plus the extra AP regeneration. But that’s up to you. Other option would be, taking some points out of agility, and putting them in endurance and charisma, and leave perception alone. I only have 3 points in agility, and it works just fine for me. Probably because of the extra agility I get from my mutations, kinda balances it out.
---
It doesn't matter what bethesda does at this point.  Just about everyone that plays this game is a whiny little bitch
---
The party dmg reduction works on you 2 if your in a group. So it’s like using lone wonderer if using strange and class freak.
---
Someone has already did an extensive test on the mutation on yt.
---
Yeah I haven't bought the plan either (I think its from the raider vendor though?) and I've been finding them on mobs and in containers. While on the subject of finding things, has anyone else been finding heaps of treasure maps since the update? I've picked up over a dozen since it hit.
---
I noticed that too
---
Fair point, you've gotta risk it for the biscuit!
---
Ya thank you, i understand now. Just wish the would fix the daym game lag. It been out for more than 2 years, and it's still a burnt tire.
---
The number of people doing public events  now is ridiculous!  I used to solo them all the time but now there are so many people we can't even social distance properly!  lol

---
Whelp, I saw the guy your responding to’s answer first and took it, and it has not halved the damage of my shotgun.
---
Do you like everything about it? Can't think of anything they could change to make the process a little more intuitive?
---
Yeah I have been finding an awful lot of treasure maps
---
As someone who bought the plans with buillon, it wouldn't bother me at all if they kept this change. They're really fun to use. Hope they get that radius buff Nuka grenades got though
---
Wow, that's really bad. Your average person would only have a few hours to do them if they change at that time.
---
Guess I shouldn't complain about then changing at 17:00
---
Are this numbers ( 21,500 per week)  with the PVP dailies or without the PVP ones?
---
I've noticed this too. With public teams being a thing, I really wish they'd increase public event spawn timers across the board since people will actually show up to them now.
---
\*Instigating not furious
---
It's a mutual benefit thing. They get ammo and I get rid of thousands of rounds of ammo for things I won't use as a strict bow user.
---
Litreally nothing we diddnt know about. Whats the point of this trailer. We know legendary perks and the wendigo collossus are coming from the pts, and the bos and ATLAS stuff has been datamined. Im left disappointed
---
The ammo converter should work the way you 'sell' legendary items to that scrip machine. Then in return it should give you something like ammo tokens (as items) with those you can buy the ammo you need
---
Made me genuinely laugh and then sad.
---
Every time I load into nuclear winter it’s for the sole purpose of getting rewards that should be available from just playing adventure mode.
---
They repeat.
---
I hadn't seen a one before, and have looted half a dozen since the patch, so I'm going to go with bug.
---
Apparently public events can reward S.C.O.R.E but that's just 1 reddit post
---
So, I just logged on for the evening and it’s back to normal. Can’t FT directly unless you own it, and it shows the resources card.
---
The progress bar! Right! 
---
Speaking of quests, I was at the very end of the last two main quests (launch a nuke and something involving the brotherhood) before the seasons update and when I logged on after the patch, those two quests were both marked complete. I can't even experience my first nuke like the game intended and now have to look up a guide because there's no quest markers. So there's that. 
---
Boy, they sure do fucking suck at their job.
---
tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies..
---
I am (was?) a casual player. I've had a long stint of not playing because of other games and life. Like, I'm glad the people who pour days and days into this game actually have more to do, but, what about casuals? What about people who want to play the game once a week?
---
They could have taken away the terminal and just had a simple pop-up like all the crafting menus. Heck they could have added a simple but funny animation of your character just pouring a bunch of random ammo from a bucket into the machine, pushing a button, and then giving it a kick while waiting for a bunch of ammo to then be dispensed. That would have added some humor to the process, been well received, and made everything much simpler.
---
Nah it's perfect 👌
---
Ok sounds like you figured out why I dropped lone wanderer. I’m always grouped with my wife when I play. Thanks for your help. You’ve more or less made me realize this kind of hybrid is going to work.
---
Ah cool, I’ve not done them yet as unsure how they work lol
---
There's not really any content to keep you coming back except for the grinds. The game will be better once that happens. Things are looking interesting in that road map
---
They really thought they were gonna release something pretty much game breaking, and they’re shitting on anything less than a 2 click ammo converter.
---
You’ll get up to around level 60 on score if you only just do the weekly for the 10 weeks. You can basically do the entire weekly in an hour or so.
---
Yeah, but those are good ideas that have been thought about with the goal of a well rounded end result. That's apparently against company policy.
---
yep. even better, when you run out of that ammo type it DOESNT move on to the next type, which would be awful.
---
Right, so they think people will buy atoms to jump levels, which some bootlickers no doubt will. The problem for them is that there isn't really anything worth spending real life money on for most people.
---
They have the greed part down the problem is they are just too incompetent and out of touch with their fan base to actually dangle good items out there.
---
Nerf this.
---
All the best with that hope. I really do mean it.
---
Do you need to talk? I'm an awkward introvert and never talk on games to strangers.
---
I got score from Heart of the swamp last night
---
Whose Hood and why u robbing him? Uncool bro
---
All they had to do was make it use a vendor menu. It's so laughably simple, and they fucked it up. The ammo converter is solid proof that they don't test anything at Bethesda. It's the most obnoxious thing I've ever used in a videogame.
---
Bethesda need to hire UI designers. Like, *actual* UI designers. Holy shit.

I have 15 strength, all heavy gunner perks, strong back, and the card that reduces ballistic ammo by 90%. Perception I have 12, all commando perks plus tank killer. Endurance max fire proof. Charisma max lone wanderer. Intelligence, I swap between max nerd rage, stabilized, batteries included, and demo expert rank 3. Or batteries included, max demo expert and rank 3 gun smith. Agility is 3, using either action boy (when in power armor), or adrenaline (even though this perk is busted right now). And luck, max bloody mess, and max of both mutation perk cards. I find this very easy to swap between using my b2525 handmade, and my b2525 gauss minigun (or furious explosive flamer).
---
Completely disagree, I have more incentive to play now whereas before wastelanders and seasons I stopped playing altogether due to nothing feasible or fun to grind other than ungodly stupid rng with gear. Now I play more often just to grind out end game power armors and whatnot because I like collecting everything I can so I have constant goals for that and now the season rewards, I also play in teams every day which are way more beneficial now as well..and while this is happening I don’t care about stupid rng rates because they aren’t the only thing to worry about anymore and you can go grind something else while the rng does it’s thing and I’ve already gotten a godroll Tesla and other bloodied weapons without specifically worry or going out of my way to grind legendary enemies. Maybe you just need a break in general as seasons aren’t forcing you to play at all, it’s just there as additional free rewards for playing and doing what you’d normally do.
---
this is what I hate about the gaming industry. they are making games, events, grinds, and content with teens and young adults who don't have full or part-time jobs (people who can't even pay for the items), People who stream (IDK anyone who would primarily stream 76 as the hate train would tear them apart), or rich Oil tycoons/Trust fund babies who whale on games because they don't know the value of money.
---
Looks like impossible to unlock 100 rank. Better play other games...
---
Simply put, I don't think life works that way, and games reflect life. It's about challenges and aspirations. There are plenty of games I never beat or fully unlocked, because I chose not to put the time into them or I couldn't, either for skill or real life reasons. This is no different to me. I don't feel like Bethesda has to ensure I can personally fully complete all content.
---
That said, I generally don't like timegating. It's a pretty common feature of persistent multiplayer games over the last 15 years and it can suck. So if Bethesda changed it up so we could earn this season's rewards at a later time, like switching boards, I'd say that sounds great.

See this is another thing I’m unsure about as I have done the dailies/weekly challenges but then it randomly moves up when I’ve not done anything.
---
No problem man. It definitely does.
---
Alright thank you man
---
I am one of those players that feels alienated
---
Just use Esc, its not listed, but it gets you out.
---
I've been playing since beta and never once had a frame rate issue other than early days sbq fights and my frames have been total garbage for the last hour.
---
the fact that there is no Secret Service daily or quests you can do for them is such a waste.
---
Dude. My missus and I had an airdrop stalking us. It even spawned in my tent one time. Legit scares me sometimes when im walking through the mire and I hear a thunk followed by a sizzle. Gets me every time.
---
Rarest to see on players or rarest to drop?
---
I use ritual bindings and skull mask. I see a lot of people wearing NV riot gear and Chinese stealth suit tho. But those just remind me of better days.
---
&gt;steps onto soap box and taps mic
---
&gt;No one from Bethesda gives a shit.
---
*clapping intensifies*
---
That’s awesomeeee - thanks for sharing!
---
Not PvPers! Although the people that can actually aim at invisible targets fuck them up pretty damn quick if they got a good handmade or legacy weapon.
---
Honestly you're not missing out on much.
---
I ended up painstakingly gathering everything, eagerly preparing to launch my first nuke. I finally get through the nuke silo dungeon, solo and fairly low level, with 3 nuke launch keys I had saved up, only for the nuke console to just instantly eat all my keys and do nothing. I still haven't gone back to any of the silos for anything besides lead farming
---
I think I applied the 25 increase for 99 levels, something like that. I knew it was a small thing missed somewhere haha.
---
&gt;  Just about everyone that plays this game is a whiny little bitch
---
Just about everyone that spends more time posting on this sub than playing the game, you mean.
---
Yeah its long way  , and if i dont even get my points why schould i even gonfor it!
---
Farm for unwanted rewards not gameplay really.
---
If they would finally fix the wrapped cap that goes perfectly with the field jacket I would actually wear mine!
---
33 is one of the "magic" prefixes. but it's +33% VATS hit chance. 25% less VATS cost isn't bugged.
---
I don't understand why people buy cards on mtg arena.
---
Oh there's plenty that could be done to improve this game that must go against company policy. They won't let us sell ammo to other players in bulk or convert it in bulk but they've got no problem with us buying atoms in bulk bundles.
---
The SSD problem is because they accidentally removed the WAITING FOR OTHER PLAYERS load-in stage, FYI.
---
Most BattlePasses I've seen has been free with a reward for every 5th level or so, with the opportunity to buy the whole pass at any given time to get all the rewards up to your level instantly, but with no further option to buy the remaining ranks.
---
With the Legendary Run you can play as much as you can then buy the rest of the ranks. It's expensive unless you e.g. buy 20 ranks with the atoms you earn as rewards plus the Fallout 1st atoms, but many BattlePasses are also closer to $20 from what I can remember
---
(Edit)
---
Seems like it's usually around $10
---
What the fuck am I playing this game for?
---
I included the one NW daily I saw in the daily challenges section, if that's what you're talking about? The one that gives 250 score.
---
Breaking the ammo into parts, ie. powder and lead is the ticket. That would have covered the need and kept the systems simpler.
---
Unless you regularly can get into the top spots for the placement XP, surviving is more lucrative than kills.
---
You get 20xp for a player kill (dangerous - they might kill you, draws attention)
---
You get 10pts for downing a player (dangerous as above)
---
5pts for killing a dog/ghoul (draws attention)
---
You however get 1xp for 4 seconds of not dying.
---
So 1 min 20 of not being dead is the same as a player kill.
---
Yeah, the pip-boy skin, sink, and ammo converter were among the main things I wanted and they're rewarded in the first hour. Beyond that, all I really want is that raider tree for my raider character, and the fireplace hidden door (which I'm not spending 479973379 atoms to unlock if I can't get to rank 99 to win it.)
---
No time to role-play in the wasteland.  Only grind. Grind till your fingers bleed. Or till your tv burns out.  Which ever comes first. They have done turned this game into a mobile game nightmare.  They have turned this franchise into everything I hate about mobile games.  The impossible amount of gameplay to achieve rewards.   Besthesda you F$#&amp;@D up by allowing a mobile game company to bring the money hungry mobile game platform to console and PC.  Shame on you.
---
Stop posting topics about ammo converter! Not funny anymore!
---
That's an awful conversion rate but would make sense in this game I guess
---
Well, my Gauss mini went from 49 damage to 98 damage...
---
Wicked
---
Apparently this is a known bug, I'd keep an eye open for a response in the coming week.
---
Protectron standing in a bush: "I AM..... INVISIBLE."
---
I'll just continue giving it away instead of trying to use it. Unintuitive and clunky is this entire game summed up.
---
All their restrictions are so arbitrary. If anything in the game makes sense, it must be by pure accident.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth with that first sentence. This game really lacks variety. They have tons of stuff but its so imbalanced between levels and practicality that its not REAL variety... 
---
That's why the only weapons that sell are junkies and bloodied, thats why no one uses metal trapper or raider armor. 
---
This game needs a diablo style endgame with randomly named bosses and selectable difficulty instances.
---
It’s possible you got your score early even before the challenge was completed, and you may have not seen those points added. I completed several challenges and did not receive score like you, because it already granted me those points. 
---
I bet if you added up the total number of points you’ve acquired so far, you might find your answer
---
I like them tbh, it’s also a good chance at ghillie stuff for people who missed or didn’t want to NW reward one
---
A mission will start when you go into a silo and you'll get markers.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mission:\_Countdown](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mission:_Countdown)
---
&gt;If it wasn't for the fallout license, these games would be considered dog shit euro jank.
---
I often wonder how many people would forgive this games dogshit visuals, recycled assets, unresponsive broken gameplay and multitude of bugs if it wasnt Fallout. 
---
It would have been dismissed as dumpster fire / shovelware / hot garbage (whatever the latest buzzword is the kids use for 'bad game' these days) shortly after its catastrophic launch.
---
All joking aside. Nerf this. And Junkies and whatever else does silly silly damage. I don't care what prep you need to do or what you have to buy. Also cap special points. nobody should be able to do damage that high.
---
Score is easy to obtain. I’m already rank 11 on the board in the first 2 days. Your right about the ghillie though. They should have bundled the entire ghillie outfits and the power armor paints at certain milestones then put more rewards in place.
---
Oh good! Thanks for letting me know.
---
It appears they were added to the grenade drop pool....I find them everywhere, but you can’t drop or trade them.
---
They really gotta work out the combat bugs in order for this not to be a dumpster fire.
---
The poor newbies that come along and look at some of those workshops must wonder what the fuck is going on. After myself and a friend left it last night, lakeside cabins was just a field full of stairs, shelves, water pumps, lamps and mothman statues
---
I’m against the people complaining about it not being broken
---
I’ve done a bunch of events and the only time I’ve gotten score points at the end of events is when it completes a challenge.
---
What? You guys aren't gonna take off your unyielding Secret Service armor so you can fight the SBQ in your newly acquired level 5 wood ghillie suit?
---
Farm lead and gunpowder from supermuties and make them. Sell the .308 rounds they drop for cheap and vendor hop to buy the ammo you want. 
---
If you're on PS4 and I hadn't already gotten rid of 6k rounds last week you could've had mine.
---
Epic thanks for clarifying
---
Not a problem!
---
Same here. It was the last two I did and got nothing. Went to check because it didn't trigger and I knew I did twice as much to complete it. When I looked at the menu it was checked off. If half of these dailies don't trigger it's going to be BS.
---
Handy! Plus Well Rested, Cranberry Relish, Brain Fungus Soup etc etc!
---
I don't care about the lack of atoms, if I want something from the shop I'll buy it with my fo1st atoms or buy extra atoms. As far as seasons go, I think its cool, atleast I have some form of progression to continue working towards, even if not all the rewards are great. Just another excuse to keep playing the game I'm currently addicted to and I didn't pay a cent.
---
Yeah I had done that too. Didn't seem to help. Things just felt abnormally slow today for some odd reason.
---
I totelly agree with you...
---
So i am not the only one ! Freaking fallout
---
What weapon? My dbl barrel with +25 vats chance Snipes from a decent ways away.... For a shotgun. Anything you have to charge I've always had absolute horrible luck
---
I was about to walk into a power planet building and it fell in front of me by the door.
---
Yeah I've noticed it, they still work they just don't show them as unclaimed, and you still can't fast travel to it if its unowned.
---
Maybe it’s a bug with the shotgun. I thought I had remembered a YouTuber say it didn’t halve the damage of his shotgun, and googling just showed me threads that basically went as this one did (one person says yes another says no).
---
Enjoyable to earn, sure. But the pressure to play everyday “to see everything” is unwelcome by many.
---
Bethesda priorities in action tho:
---
Overhaul systems that are fine to implement systems that encourage microtransactions and grind.
---
I don't think that's necessary, considering you aren't always going to have time to get every food buff imaginable, this isnt something you can do every queen unless you're the one launching the nuke.
---
This isn't something your going to see every queen most players are casual and don't have the time to spend a hour of their day prepping.
---
Ah thank you, so to scrip it goes
---
No, people have a job and others games, they can't farm only 76
---
And of course there's a points cap, a laughably low points cap. Why did I expect anything better?
---
ever fight a scorch beast and track it back into the nuke with your myriad party or 12-16 people and find a wendigo colussus in the pink trees? i did. this happened while i did the tedious quests. never give up. its all about the journey not the destination
---
It's coming to Xbox and PC gamepass on the 9th, I'm hoping that gives us a population boost and them a revenue boost
---
I can't use it because it doesn't even show the computers screen, I puts me below the screen
---
You sure it was Jangles? The Jangles backpack is a reskin of an existing Mr. Pebbles backpack, the two are identical except Mr. Pebbles' head is replaced with Jangles.
---
Yep, I loved having 5 points spent in agility for it, but now it's a complete waste and I personally don't feel like playing until they fix it.
---
They've stated that all seasons will be free to play for everyone, though atoms can be spent to speed the progress. People flipped shit over the wording in the initial announcement and it's since been clarified. We aren't going to have to buy the seasons.
---
Right! And we already have it, too: ammo can be broken down into steel, lead and gunpowder (plastic too where appropriate) which you can use for existing recipes. Hmm. Maybe make a post on this, actually.
---
I didn’t actively play a lot of the game though. I play 1 to 2 hours a day at most.  I took a break for a month and came back to try the new score system.
---
Edit: this downvote from you is pathetic. This pass is here for people who want to play the game actively. Hell just doing the weekly gives tons of points. It’s not like the pass gives any gameplay benefits except from extra currency.
---
there's no cap on exp score, is there? with enough patience and a friend, or a leveled alt account, you could probably power level enough to unlock it.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if more effects are bugged now.  Have no idea what is actually going on but I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the adrenaline perk broke due to an attempt to fix bugged weapons....just like the time they fixed +250drwr and broke half the players armor.
---
If this could come with 1st premium platinum club subscription I'd lay down the 49.99 a month for bush wookie bot
---
i could fast travel for free to one i had yesterday. Today i cannot. Yesterday i could fast travel for free when the workshop had been take so i could capture it back. today i couldn't. 
---
It's bananas.
---
Use the ammo converter
---
Black lives matter!
---
That’s absolutely disgusting. I’m sorry you dealt with that.
---
spooky crate
---
I found two major issues with the ammo converter: fixed amounts of ammo for conversion and poor menu navigation for repeatedly selling/buying ammo. Having to save up groups of x for [ammo] is daunting because most explosive ammo is heavy (even in small amounts) and the large amounts of smaller rounds requires repeatedly navigating through the menu for each type. Not enough Mini Nukes to earn points. Better save room if you intend to turn in what you have at a later time. Have a ton of .38? Better get mashing. Oh, and watch that cap while you're at it. I could have forgiven this oversight, even the steep conversion rate can be adjusted later, if it weren't for the menu navigation issue when repeatedly purchasing/selling ammo. The first issue makes it nearly unbearable to cycle through hundreds of shotgun and fusion cells.
---
My suggestion is to first modify the conversion rate to be based on the value of per ammo. Secondly, allow for a dump of ammo, just as we would with junk. Lastly, use a numerical input for purchasing ammo. God forbid we would have to use the directional scale UI, but for now, baby steps.
---
Side note. For all PC users, there is a way to reduce the headache of selling/buying ammo in larger amount. After selling/buying ammo, hit the Tab button to return to the previous screen. This can be repeated until ammo or currency is depleted. Hope this helps and somehow works on console.
---
I thought other people in public groups weren't allowed to build in your CAMP?
---
man what about the casual players who just get on and do events then build the camp up and see the vendor refresh around charleston. at best ill make it to 50
---
Would it surprise you to know that you are their target audience? That is how badly they have failed.
---
I had Beckett before the update, no dailies for a while.  Played last night, first daily in a long time.
---
What's even worse is...is that it had nothing inside.
---
Boy, you must have failed economics.
---
If the price of peanut butter was 18.50 one day and then 62.40 the next. (How many atoms you can get in 12 weeks now vs then divided by 100) then noone would buy it even if it came with some motor oil and lip stick because many of the customers won't want all of those things. They'd rather spend the extra 41.90 elsewhere
---
I know OP meant it as a joke, but yeah, I'd absolutely buy that one in a heartbeat.
---
Naw. They like being mad. It wouldn’t matter if there was times of new content.
---
the problem is that they keep halfassing these fixes. like gauss weaponry. instead of fixing the shotgun properly, they just reduced the damage while using vats by 50% *globally*. so the rifle, which was never affected by this bug in the first place, is now effectively useless in vats.
---
they most likely used a similar bandaid fix for the furious effect which clearly backfired as well.
---
Just promise to stay off the PTS....
---
Progress can be purchased with atoms.
---
Honestly never needed Deep pockets on any Armor set. I only carry 1 weapon and enough ammo for my days adventures. I have a carry weight of 325 on my level 80 character and always have 100 to 150 free space. Don’t collect junk, don’t hang onto 1* trash and don’t carry 50 stimpaks. Don’t run Thru Hiker. Don’t run Travelling Pharmacy. Don’t run Pack Rat. Stop wasting perks. Sorry but heard too many people complain about this. Bring on the downvotes peeps
---
Ok if i need someone to clear the way sometime send me a message. 
---
According to Mr Turtle (you know, the Angry one) the "magic" happens when:
---
- Fire rate required (~200), plus Prefix OR Major (does not need to be both)
---
- Prefix
---
  - Instigating
---
  - Junkies
---
  - Medics
---
  - Stalkers
---
- Major
---
  - +33% vats hit chance
---
  - +50% limb damage
---
  - +40% bash damage
---
If the weapon has a splitter or the Explosive attribute then the effective fire rate is boosted based on each beam or explosion counting as an additional "hit". So a lower fire rate weapon could also work "magically". However the SBQ has Explosive immunity, so best to have ~200 fire rate native to the weapon.
---
Buy from him on the exact same day every week.  Not sure if it works once you are bugged though.  All you can really do is go every single day and see if he "resets". Then write the day down somewhere and make sure you go on that day every fricken week.
---
Not the best answer but it's something at least.
---
Ive got 1k for radiation rumble before a few times, hopefully someone can work out how it actually works
---
no, theyve both been delayed for reworking and will come in another update.
---
You don't have to wait out the match. When you die you get the exp and you can leave.
---
There *are* some challenges that involve you waiting until the match is over but those usually reward perk cards, not exp.
---
Eventually yes, but not at the start of the season.
---
My bad
---
Thanks man! Exactly what I needed to know. I appreciate your response.
---
I mean you are addressing the same people responsible for horse armor...
---
they actually pulled off something incredibly difficult: bringing mobile monetization strategies to triple A gaming to moderate success.
---
cancerous, but impressive nonetheless.
---
Thank you my well informed friend
---
I updated my posted to show a link to a video with some gameplay.
---
People want some new gameplay, not a grind for unwanted rewards. 500 atoms per month not funny really
---
And yet you asked so nicely.....
---
I'm having the same issue with the same two weekly challenges. It's so frustrating.
---
How dare you make a well written, well informed post and use the heresy of logic.
---
Heathen!
---
Reddit has no room for your kind. 
---
Have my upvote sir, well written post.
---
I think its similar to the scorchbeast bug. I dunno if it happens to everyone, but when I kill scorchbeasts and then load into an exterior cell either via fast travel or from an interior, there is a high likelyhood the corpse will drop on my face. I think with the crates its the same thing, only you shot it down or came across a random encounter that had a crate spawn and now its just stalking you, or maybe you came across someone elses crate spawn and it liked you better.
---
I actually was aware of the mr pebbles backpack and I’m 99% sure this was Jangles. Like I said I was shocked so I got close to him to check and it looked like Jangles but I didn’t play fo76 at launch so I wasn’t sure if it was an early player unlock
---
That's something they sold in the Atom shop. They can do absolutely nothing with the ammo converter and their excuse could be that it since it was free, they have no obligation to fix it.
---
Then they dont get the rewards.  You dont need a chicken coop.
---
LMAO I didn't even think about that you right tho 🤣
---
Horse Armor says hello
---
I was under the impression folks from public groups couldn't mess with your camp.
---
Were you in a public team? Private team?
---
Over 12 weeks that averages 18 atoms a day. Assuming you sign in daily. Which you almost assuredly have to in order to get that many atoms. That's 1-2 challenges in the old system
---
Weirdly enough I'm getting -2 to my Special while grouped with Herd right now and it's going back to normal when I leave the team.
---
No, it's broken and delayed
---
More than ok, I really appreciate it!
---
Well if it wasn’t from the random grouping then it was from someone that I play with regularly which disturbs me more.  I really hope it was from the random teams i’ve been joining lately.
---
Check if your Pip-Boy light is on
---
Jangles is Rank 86 and with no fast rank buying for the first 2 weeks it would be quite some feat to get it in little more than a day. 
---
Its essentially the same skin as Mr Pebbles and I suspect that's what it was.
---
Hasn’t worked since FO4
---
yeah, I keep forgetting Bethesda has indeed pioneered the concept of Fing players over.
---
thanks for creating DLC, Todd.
---
Yeah I did. Every Monday, was good for 3-4 weeks then quit just last Monday
---
Leave the server and rejoin mate.
---
No worries. I can at least tell you if it's by Delano Grange it'll spawn by the ransacked bunker and get attacked by bloodbugs and the one just south of Watoga will spawn at the NAR repair yard. I think those are the wordt offenders, the rest work.
---
It's new to the update. Some assume a bug but I like to think of it as a feature.
---
Can we somehow brain wash the people pissed about the data entry decoration....I mean ammo converter.....to bitch...I mean politely criticize for this to happen.
---
I’m with you on this.
---
I have been with this game since the beginning when everyone else was saying it was a broken mess, me and my friend were still finding our fun with it.
---
The news cycle started ripping apart the atom store and Fallout 1st and I ignored the critical because the game allowed me to ignore the predatory practises.
---
This time it hits different, they have dangled time limited rewards and put a strict deadline on it. I’ve even dabbled with other battle passes before and never felt like I had to run the numbers to figure if it was possible.
---
I’m thinking of just making an effort to get the last few trophies I need for the platinum and having that be this games swan song for me.
---
I've started a new build based on CHR for this very reason - my main is at 3 CHR
---
That's still WAY too much. You shouldn't have to play every single day and do every single challenge for 10 and STILL not be able to complete the season.
---
This has been a bug since the game first came out. The social menu is just broken most of the time. Switching servers sometimes helps, or if you're on console you can join a friend from the console options such as "join game." These options don't always work, bit it is what it is. Most of us who've been playing since the start have gotten used to the bugged social menu.
---
Likely a display glitch with existing skin...
---
That is so weird. I appreciate it dude
---
Well that is just awesome. Pretty sure it was meant to be in this update unless they delayed it just like everything else that was supposed to be in this one and I didn't hear about it.  Haven't really been keeping up with the news much anymore.
---
The stuff that wasn't delayed is all pretty much messed up too lol.
---
I don't understand how this manages to be ***so*** much worse than the reloading bench from New Vegas.  
---
Like...they have an example of how to do this sort of thing *right there*.
---
They said they want the fastest way,not the slowest, most painful way.
---
I have kids so I'm not completing it anyway
---
You complete those at 3/5 and get the SCORE. You don't get any more when you hit 5/5 then. That's how it was for me for alle the weekly x/5 challenges. Irritating, but it's actually a bonus/faster.
---
I doubt it since they claim to have removed god mode glitch. But let me guess....pc?
---
Ah.  Come on now.  You _can_ complete it.  You just have to do it the way they want to.  You need to go spend $100 on atoms and you’ll be all set.  You’re welcome.
---
I've taken several long breaks from the game. If you don't come back, that's fine, and if you do, I hope the game is rewarding again!
---
I am just bummed it's such a slow grind. I don't mind having to actually play the game like I keep seeing people say but I don't want to spend 100 hours just to hit level 100.
---
I understand that's where a lot of games are these days though so I'm not complaining too hard. I just won't fret over it. I'll play how I want and if I get some rewards, cool.
---
It only being around for such a period of time, you only being able to earn so much exp in that period of time. It really puts me off the whole thing. Talk about serious Fear Of Missing Out.
---
Your right, I just tested by joining a private team and can’t change anything in their camp, that means it was someone I trusted before the patch and i’m just noticing now.
---
People on your friend list can't build in your CAMP without your permission either. To do this, they must join you in a private group (ie the old group system). So either you somehow accidentally invited someone to a private group separately from a public group and they joined, or someone sent you an invite to join a private group and you mistakenly accepted.
---
The 10k XP challenge is repeatable, which means by the end of the week somebody will be on here complaining it was too easy to get all 100 ranks.
---
Np
---
Level up again. I think it's designed to stop people abusing that and just levelling a new toon every time they need to.
---
It did it twice too. I tped to an event to do, see it but didn't see it drop because I wasn't focused on it. After that event I tped to a power plant event and when I was about to go in, it fell above the door lol.
---
Your probably right but he was already wearing a ghillie suit so I honestly thought he may have actually grinded that far already
---
Are you suddenly running on teams with random weirdos, where before you ran with weirdos that knew how to sneak?
---
On a different note, I was so confused why my UI turned blue. These posts have given me context
---
Almost makes it worse imo! That sucks that someone you trusted would do that.
---
I know a friend of mine came in and messed up my camp last month as well so you have my sympathy. Hope it doesn't happen again.
---
&gt;I’m a bloodied melee player
---
I mean, you could already oneshot everything. are you oneshotting things more efficiently now?
---
I got some too and don't know the plan.  Hopefully it stays. Lol
---
I’m going to try. What’s the quickest way to level up from 2-3? Do I just complete a quest? Which one?
---
I don't group like ever, so there'll probably be a handful I'll miss...but they're virtual tchotchkes, so.
---
Trying to earn every Indrik got me out of the stress over it, lol.
---
To me I enjoy getting on having new things to grind out. When you have done everything since beta you get burned out, but now I have something to look forward to everyday. It all just depends on what you want to do. If I'm not on fallout I'm doing league race practice and league races, so to be able to come in and do my daily and weekly challenges and get a better reward than just a couple of atoms is worth it now. This type of fallout isn't for everybody, you gotta want to get on and grind it out, if want old style fallout, go back to fallout 4, 3, or new vegas. Dont knock it though, find a team, if you cant then make one with some low lvls and help them out. It's online multiplayer for a reason.
---
That’s rough.
---
With the inevitable mid-season patches you might be screwed out of maxing out the board by sheer download time alone.
---
🤣
---
Might help to put which system you play on
---
I did mean it as a joke, but then I wanted it, so I actually agree. Giv now.
---
Never pound your meat while playing 76, messy ending...
---
sorry PC.
---
I just want the chicken coop. Before I was able to buy something like that directly from the store. Now I have to buy 77 other items I don't want just to get the one I do.  
---
And this is even WITH spending real money on it, to avoid the grind.
---
It's a bad system.
---
... and a leather armor ghillie suit, and a metal armor ghillie suit, and a robot armor ghillie suit, and a combat armor ghillie suit, and a scout armor ghillie suit, and a marine armor ghillie suit, and a secret service armor ghillie suit, and a ghillie backpack.
---
They're intentionally filling the season with trash cosmetics.
---
Yeah, well I one shot everything but now I  can kill the queen in one landing.
---
I've found them several times among loot. Maybe they are a new game edition but they don't appear often enough to rely on as the primary source if they are your grenade of choice.
---
I think if it is a dev decision its a pretty bad one considering how poor they are if crafted off the Gold plans. Maybe if they were 'lite' versions it would be OK, although that would mean a significant buff for the underwhelming Bullion ones.
---
I have not I don't have anything that I use ultracite for in my opinion for the amount of damage that you get compared to the resources in the materials that are needed in order to get to get that are not good enough for me
---
LOOL WTF
---
Just follow the main quest. It really won't take long.
---
Had it bugged for me too. I waited 10 days to go back again and it worked. Could just be coincidence but saw others post the same.

SCORE and Atoms aside... with this update I noticed that every event I normally end up doing alone had people joining left and right! Also we ended up grouping so the legendary kills, say in Radiation Rumble, that occured on the other side of the event still counted for me which sometimes can be a problem with other people one shotting them if they join solo in more popular events. Then we ended up staying grouped, dropped 3 nukes and completed other events to pretty much clear a large chunk of the Dailies and Weekly objectives together
---
you can buy them for 6-8k. It's not a guaranteed drop and you could do it 20 times and not get one.
---
Which one? Wayward?
---
Nope on Xbox !
---
i role play as a character in a mobile game and it all makes sense
---
Possibly a bug, since I didn't bother to learn the plan to craft. But also possibly intended, because you could pick up other types of grenades, weapons, etc. before you could craft them?
---
Been trying for 6 hours a day and 3 days in a row. Still nothing.
---
How to fix it.
---
1. Each ammo type provides a certain number of points when deposited.
---
2. Each ammo type costs a certain number of points when bought.
---
Yes, I invented a vendor, something already in the game.
---
I disagree. Not trying to really defend them but offering my point of view.
---
First off, we really don't need to b and moan about everything. Try to be a little more positive.
---
I think it is the way it is not only for technical reasons but also game balance ones. It is meant to be much worse than trading. It shouldn't be an unlock to win situation either.
---
It's something that can be useful if you really need specific ammo now or can spend a bit of time converting some of the stuff that no one otherwise wants into something useful.
---
If this was too easy or too good of a rate, trading ammo wouldn't be a thing anymore, same as freebies for newbies ammo-wise.
---
You aren't meant to be hoarding hundreds of thousands of one (almost useless) kind of ammo in the first place and if you do then that is on you alone.
---
If you want to be reductive to try and dismiss peoples concerns about wanting to engage with a system intended to be engaged with but badly implemented then that rabbit hole can get quite deep.
---
Hooray for truth
---
nah i’ll make sure to complain about it extra now
---
So just to make it’s not me
---
No, event delayed
---
Seasons is not good for fallout 76, i said it a lot of times in the past few weeks but just seems to not stick with some people.
---
* It's just a clever way for Bethesda to disguise existing content as new content.
---
* It's another monetization scheme. It's a time sensitive grind with a pay-to-advance option (coming in two weeks).
---
It's almost as if the majority of people who play this game have only ever experienced playing the fallout series and have no idea about other games or even what a live service game should be.
---
Look around at other games and you'll see seasonal/battle passes that trump Bethesda's by tenfold. Apex Legends seasons usually come with brand new weapons, mods, map changes, special events, and even new classes. Look at path of exile and how they do their seasons, they don't even have a monetization scheme for it as much as Bethesda but their seasons are truly stellar and all have a lot of content and are very unique. And then there's Destiny 2 and their seasons actually adds content to the game, not just retextured and recolored cosmetics.
---
I know those games aren't all 100% similar to Fallout 76, but i'm strictly covering the battle pass here.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Fallout players you're so naive you once again allowed Bethesda to trick you. We can't even get some basic quality of life functionality added but we get seasons and another monetization scheme. I mean imagine that fallout 76 is:
---
* buy to play
---
* with a monthly subscription
---
* and in-game microtransactions
---
* and now has a pay-to-advance option for it's season pass.
---
It should have just been the New Vegas reloading bench.
---
I've got 2 plans for sale in my vendor for 5k if you want one. add me, ign same as here.
---
Let em
---
I never in a million years would have thought you could do every single daily and weekly challenge for 10 straight weeks and not complete seasons. That's absolutely ridiculous. I am very much an all or nothing person and if they don't buff rewards and make this more attainable then I'm not even going to attempt seasons except when there is a great reward at a low level.
---
If they designed this to make me play more it is a total failure.
---
No I have been grouping with a steady group of people the last few weeks, so it would of had to of happened then and I just noticed.  I’m glad now for the new grouping system then so I don’t find anymore surprises.
---
ok will do.
---
🤣🤣🤣 no. Lol i enjoy some of it damn. Hahaha
---
I-i I I could burn dow-down bethesda. I-I could.
---
God maybe it'll make em realize the mistake they've made
---
Nullified. Imaging simping so hard for a corporation that you can't even comprehend or show understanding as to why people would be upset about being basically excluded from the biggest 'content'(?) update since Wastelanders because they have lives.
---
If you're on PC, I'd pay probably 2500 caps for the Gatling Plasma. Its not a god tier roll, but its serviceable enough for general use and maybe even the Scattered mod.
---
As for the helmet, I'd have no idea, would have to ask one of the outfit kleptomaniacs.
---
No, it's not just you. Most of the time my friends say the game tells them I'm in the main menu- even when I'm in the game and we're looking right at each other.
---
It fix most there problems though
---
I mean ive only spent like $80 bucks on atoms 🤣🤣🤣
---
I’m gonna be honest I think people expect too much from this game. But it could be my perspective as a newish player - so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Can you ask him what their thinking was behind the ammo converter?
---
I had the flu during October Halloween NW and still got them done. Die or die
---
I can agree with how many description of work I think maybe that was the possibility of looking at it if you think about it it's the same thing of when you try to sell stuff in your vendor if you don't have the space for it won't let you do it so if we are only doing 2000 point and you've got you know 5010 mm round you're obviously going to go over the 2,000 points I would say that may be removing the point cap is something that should be looked at why have a point cap what makes a difference if I'm going to turn in however many and get 10000 points as opposed to me having to told me turn in 2,000 points by X
---
As far as your last question I think as I said before that we are all feeling this way because of the amount of ammo that we have however in a week from now when we don't have those thousands of rounds were only going to be doing a few handful at a time I myself only play for about half hour to 45 minutes at night I work two jobs I married and I've got kids so I have other things that I need to do not saying that anybody or you yourself is less important because you don't have those things I don't know but I to only have a certain amount of time that I can play for so to me I know that I'm going to have to go back to my Camp a little bit more now if I really want those points as opposed to selling them off or just selling the ones that never sell which in my case from what I've seen is 10 mm and 38 caliber all my other bullets always sell in my vending machines I also only sell all of the ammo for one each
---
And I don't know if you are an Xbox which is where I am I would be very interested in your Fusion cells if you were looking to sell them
---
The idea of Fallout 1st was great, just like a lot of the other ideas we see at first before they come out. Look at all this great stuff we are going to get! Unfortunately we just aren't seeing things being delivered on repeatedly. Wastelanders was the first time they took the proper time but even then all the daily caps and the bugs still left a sour taste for many people. 
---
Right now I think they need to step back and reevaluate Fallout 1st and what they are giving us. I wonder how many subscribers actually use their private servers for anything more than to transfer items safely between characters. The discounted item in the shop was usually a single item that was kind of a joke. I doubt anybody really buys it. They would probably be better off offering a 50% off (or even just 25%) coupon that only lasts one month and is good for any item that you buy. The point is it just needs a massive overhaul of everything except for the scrapbox and the tent, which right now are the only true benefits to subscribing.
---
Same here.  Wasn't even testing it but noticed it immediately.  I was getting thousands of xp for seemingly no reason and then when I fully completed the challenge received nothing.  Numbers all add up however.  No real rhyme or reason either.  Some complete at 25 percent and others at 50 or 60 at least in my experience so far.
---
As soon as I completed scorched Earth and got 1k points I just started to wonder exactly which one I completed that isn't even close to done.  Same just happened with project paradise.  No way to know what is actually happening until I complete all of these.  A small amount for completing events would really be nice though for sure.
---
🤣🤣🤣 that ammo converter was definitely rough. Ha
---
I'm really liking the free parties. My event ratio is up so far, I didn't play with anyone before this.
---
Those two, I received the SCORE points, when I completed 3/5 instead of completing 5/5. You probably did receive those points at 3/5 instead of 5/5.
---
IDK it's not like their complaints are invalid. The thing that infuriates me is the radio silence; people that are ON THE FO76 TEAM post response comments and such on this subreddit - and yet they don't talk or make 'feedback' posts? If I was on the team, having a feedback thread is a no-brainer: speak with your audience, get the gist, fix and/or placate the audience. Just the simple act of talking with the paying customer would solve so much problems.
---
I usually play TF2, and the interaction between player and developer is even worse; the game is near unplayable with all the bots now. The only substantial way they can make FO76 better is for open communication. 
---
So yeah - it's just infuriating for most to see their complaints not being heard, so they believe if they scream louder someone might answer.
---
I've seen plenty of high level players just hide in a corner and wait for the event to finish to get the reward without expending any ammo or resources. For shame you leeches, you know who you are! : P
---
I completed it and got nothing I was pissed
---
I do too, but Jesus we have like 7 different currencies, bugs and stuttering are beginning to pile again, grind fest of magnum proportions, content that slowly drops. 
---
Beth just wants Whales to buy shit.
---
Plenty spend more...
---
I can confirm this is not the case as I can use the orange camo skins for wood and scout in NW from 1st. You just need to select them from the shop,which is not possible with the new ghillie wood skin.
---
The new ghillie simply doesn't have the button.if we make this known,devs will patch it.
---
&gt; you could do it 20 times and not get one.
---
Me. Right here.
---
I still don't even know what it is or what all the fuss is about it. Kinda hard to judge when it's an item that can't be looted from anywhere and never drops from anything.
---
Yup, it's a total grind - a fucking, boring grind.
---
I'll probably log on to build once in a while, but I'm pretty much done.  Especially as daily challenges no longer give atoms.
---
Honestly, with the make good this game still needs to do, having the first season be easy wouldn’t have been a bad idea.
---
But something remotely closer to RDR2 would be Miles better.
---
I could finish that whole pass in 3-4 evenings if efficient play.
---
This is where I agree. These passes should be doable without playing everyday.
---
Some people don’t have time to get on everyday and instead have to have bigger sessions on their days off, however this system really screws them over.
---
Stopped playing it for the day. Not gonna get the points, what’s the point in trying.
---
I’m getting very close to the decision of just cutting myself off from all these live service games. The grind can be addictive, but I recently played through The Messenger and had more fun in a few days than I have in all the months I’ve spent grinding games like this. 
---
There are still things I find enjoyable about these games but there’s so much repetitive busywork to do in between that I have to ask myself why I’m not just playing games that are fun the whole time.
---
Some advice for burn out that helps me is do your favorite activities between quests to give yourself a break and a reminder that you like the game
---
You're rank 11 because you had weeklies and the SCORE ranks are cheap this early compared to further on. I hit Rank 11 yesterday due to the same thing plus grinding xp for the repeatable to break out of Rank 10. Today? The Daily Quests barely pushed me into Rank 12. It's going to slow way, way down, with a slight boost Weekly.
---
I feel like their actual more to and look forward to it gets boring to long in do random shit that’s the same thing everyday and have nothing to show for it or even spend that day not even getting anything good, now their actually a motivation to do something and actually earn things, instead I having to pay for it, that’s the whole point of grinding.
---
I was thinking of starting a new character to keep things fresh and trying something different from what I already have. I'm glad I read this as I naturally forgot about this thinking it would be patched recently. Silly me!
---
It's totally ridiculous you can do EVERY SINGLE challenge for 10 straight weeks and still not complete seasons. I can't speak for everyone but since this is so hard to complete, I'm going to play less, not more.
---
Lol i know man. 🤣🤣🤣 there are definitely some improvements that could be made man. Like i have like 500 treasury notes. Why tf cant i convert em? I earned that shit. Ha also why have daily limits on how much scrip you can earn if they put a cap on how much you can have? Doesnt make sense. Ha
---
If you’re on Xbox I’d say the helmet is trade only unless you really want caps, and then you could probably get a lot more than 30k. The plasma like the other dude said it’s not god tier but it’s good enough. I’d say around 5-10k. Maybe more if it goes down to a bid war. Currently caps are kinda useless.
---
There's 2 Ghillie paints in the first 12 levels. I'm rank 11 and am still finishing story quests, I'm pretty sure concentrating on quests would get several ranks higher.
---
As i said - you already got it before. at 3/5. 
---
Remember how many challenges you did so far? Add em up. Calculate it. You got those!
---
Plasma: I would love a drop like that, might be worth a pretty penny. You have wandered tour own question hete though; it does not fit your playstyle, so why keep it? Find a buyer and make him/her happy! (And fill tour own pockets in the proces, obviously). 
---
As far as the helmet goes, I do think it is still a sought after item (only in combination with the matching outfit maybe?), I wouldn’t have a clue on a price though.
---
Yeah - mine is sitting just above broken so I have put it in my stash until this is fixed
---
What do you play on?
---
Look at the brain on Brad!  Big words, hating on corporations, and threatening a deep rabbit hole.  Your like a reddit triple threat.  I'm lvl 13 right now so I'm gonna go play outside with my kids.  
---
O and you welcome for giving you something to downvote so you get that satisfaction of putting a simpleton in his digital place.  Stay safe my internet amigo!
---
Technically, south of West Virginia would just be Virginia- which is where the Capitol Wasteland is located (or Kentucky if it's the southwestern corner.) I'd love to revisit Rivet City in 76.
---
The helmet also counts as a gas mask, look stylish and stay safe from fumes at the same time!
---
No one is forcing you into nuclear winter.
---
I understand that your having the symptom of having the fear of missing out but does it truly matter what you get from the pass? This is a free update it’s great for everyone. People who don’t play much will still get rewarded but players who actively support the game will get more rewards.
---
I know I’m not going to get all the rewards because of rl but does it truly matter? Bethesda is a company not your friend. Them making the pass for free for everyone is as good as your going to get.
---
They could have put it behind fallout first membership but they didn’t. They could have done so much worse. This is as close as your gonna get to a good pass system in a live service game.
---
Lol head to New Vegas and start a legion before Caesar does
---
But freemium implies we didn't buy the game. This is just premium monetization
---
Try what the other person said I guess. Don't go back for a while.  I have seen that posted as well thinking about it.  Supposedly entering the wayward can reset the bug and you need to wait it out.
---
Just having to type something that stupid is making me think about finding a new game to play at night.
---
I used a new character. Did both NW lvl 
---
up and adventure lvl up in one swoop.
---
Visit Vault 69 I know it’s out there somewhere ;-)
---
That trailer is great. The public teams have been pretty fun so far. The only negative I have so far is my map is a little busy now.  I am really looking forward to the new BOS content.
---
How did you do this?
---
Seriously, but yes I have had the same problem, but with various weapons, not just my shotgun. Snipe a guy with a rifle just to see his health rubberband back. Or run into enemies that just stand there, you can fire away but they just regenerate, but also never attack back. Broken game being broken.
---
Yeah, skins work in NW on armor
---
It was changed. It automaticly does it now if you have the perk equipped.
---
It's poorly designed and overtly predatory.
---
OP, gave you several reasons already
---
Why do people complain about complaining is a better question.
---
Criticism is necessary for healthy improvement. And if they won't critique themselves they players ought to.
---
That's because they gutted the update.
---
I found that out the rough way yesterday and nuked Monongah Mine with a friend... No luck, wasted some Fusion Cores and a keycard.
---
Yup, pretty frustrating when I have the 95% chance(and 3\* concentrated fire for good measure) to hit while having the barrel of my shotgun shoved down a ghoul's throat and still somehow miss 4 times in a row. 
---
On another note, when I was making a VATS build, I really thought gun fu would've been amazing. Ideally, you could use it to rush into a room of enemies and clear it pretty quickly. Issue is, with the lag or time it takes for the server to register the enemy has died, I might as well just not waste any points in gun fu and manually VATS shot everything(there always seems to be about a half second delay for me)
---
Literally just as me and my friend were screwing around, I looked out past the bog and said "look at all that field that I wish I could explore." And I was gonna run into the barrier to say "Yup, look at how far we can go. And then uhh... There was no barrier.
---
Update 19 removed the need to push an extra button.  It does it automatically now.
---
Upvoted, I want this too
---
I'm not sure sure if they are breaking faster or I'm just using them a hell of a lot more with events being more fun with how populated they are again. But yeah I had to repair my handmade 3 times last night and usually I only need to repair it the once.
---
I completed it I’ve done every challenge Botha yesterday and today’s dailys and the weeklys and I never got what I was owed
---
You still need help?
---
Yeah I saw the ign footage and thought it was out. Thanks for the help tho! 👍🏼
---
I'm subscribed to 1st, played in the BETA, do PTS to help improve the game, and plan to reach Rank 100. Genrally a Bethesda fan and have been since Morrowind. I'm just willing to call out predatory game design for what it is. If that's 'hating' for you then it honestly says more about you and than me, friend.
---
"only"?
---
That's 2 times what the game cost and 8 times what it's worth
---
Is your house near the waterfall in the mire? This happen to me. I end up using the power armor glitch to get into the tree.
---
Acting like Bethesda are the only ones doing it. 
---
Shit tons of games do and its bullshit. Bethesda were actually later to the game than anyone else but somehow other company's have started getting better whereas Bethesda hasn't
---
Ah okay, well that explains that...thanks!
---
The gun is okay, nothing spectacular. That helmet, though, is extremely rare and worth far more than just caps. You could trade that for some pretty incredible equipment to someone who's hunting for it.
---
&gt; So it makes it impossible for people who can’t play everyday to earn score.
---
I think what you meant to say is something like "So it makes it impossible for people who can’t play everyday reach the finish line during the season."  
---
Even if you're not going to reach the finish line, look at all the rewards along the way that might interest you.   It's really easy to earn score when you are able to play.
---
I'm not sure it should be counted as a "currency", but there are also Pleasant Valley Claim tickets you can turn in for rewards. They have a slim chance of being looted from ghouls and scorched.
---
Unhappy robot face..
---
Sorry it's all I see when I look at that sink lol
---
Usually going to NW is what stops tracking my adventure challenges(i only have the wood one left).
---
I had this bug happen with under armour I crafted before the patch. I made new under armour and it worked perfectly so try making a fresh set
---
Level 129, heavy build here. I‘d like to buy this! Do you want caps or resources? 
---
Ingame: JKL213, just like here.
---
1850 caps for 12 weeks is roughly 22 atoms a day. Vs the original 60. You have to reach rank 100 to get that many. That means signing in daily for 10 weeks straight and doing every challenge. If you get t0 99 you only get about 17 atoms. Less than 2 and sometimes one of the old challenges.
---
Also there are 7 dailies instead of 5 so it takes more challenges to get less atoms
---
Wow thanks! That would be awesome.
---
Also, you will hear and see a little animation when the perk found you additional items.
---
Yeah
---
Sexy. Cunts. On. Raging. Erections.
---
Same dude. Although the only other reward I’m looking forward to is the wallpaper.
---
Same for all the other perks similar to this like butcher's bounty and can do. Issue with the butcher's bounty now though is that you can only get the chance if you already got loot from it or in other words, you can't just search a bunch of corpses that other players or AI's killed.
---
Np will let you know when am on tomorrow - k
---
Oh, without a doubt.
---
This would be very useful. I think mechanical keyboard + luckyhole smelting + ammo crafting is actually jeopardising my marriage.
---
Im in the level 150s and use mutations. I forgot about that one so I might put that one up next time. I have 5 points in charisma. Im waiting for the changes to food to come in so I can maybe shuffle some special points around once I dont need to use perks to mitigate food issues so much. Im hoping to gain a point somewhere for Charisma then I can start sharing the 2 point cards
---
yea I've been eyeing those mountains lol they look nice
---
maybe I can at least find a spot thatat least limits the directions I can be assaulted by enemy spawns at least, make it easier to defend
---
Got no plan after 20 events, as a heavy build it‘s not important for me. Rifle build friend bought one Level 50 Fixer off a vendor at someone‘s camp who was selling like 8 of them, can’t remember the name.
---
Loving the under armour but yeah I've definitely noticed the increase to diseases from missing my wet suit.
---
Yea but i really wanted some of that stuff. Ha its no different than any of the other shit other games have for sale.
---
It's a unique combat rifle. Slightly higher damage, but it's got stealth boosts built in. If you learn the plan, you can get legendary versions of it from the purveyor or the ally weapon case dailies. With the right legendary perks, it's basically the ultimate weapon for a stealth commando/rifleman.
---
Deleted already

Is there a actively updated site with changelogs on this sort of stuff?  The wiki fandom seems to usually be accurate, but doesn’t say this was changed at X time.

Can you tell me the exact spot where you left the Bog?
---
I've noticed my frames have been dropping constantly lately on my xbox one x, never really happened before this new patch
---
The foods I need to get a grasp on. I keep mama doulces handy but not the perishable food.
---
&gt;They could have put it behind fallout first membership but they didn’t. They could have done so much worse.
---
The fact you don't see that they have done exactly that is amusing. What, exactly, do you think the intent behind making it such a grind, but allowing you to 'skip'/purchase ranks for a 'paltry' 150 Atoms/$1.50 is? Given I'm subbed to 1st and some Atoms saved up means I can skip around 30 Ranks outright, which I'll wait til the end to do as they are the longest/hardest. So I'm certainly not afraid of missing out. Misaimed with that one.
---
The issue is that it's designed in such a way to be predatory. To tempt/push you into paying to win/progress. That's shitty conduct and deserves to be called out.
---
I’m so glad there are people that feel the same I’m guessing the majority of people feel this way if only we could get the community together and everyone just stops playing for a week and then they can see we are sick and tired of the petty lack luster “content” they throw at us. Never mind we can’t stay off for a week I must be crazy to think that WE HAVE TO GET OUR DAILY EVERYTHING DONE -_-
---
This happens when I'am in my power armor, once I get out of the armor it seems to work fine..
---
Unfortunately, I'm on PC so I can't sell them to you, thank you for the business offer though. If there was cross-play sure but then that would be a disaster for everyone because of the hackers. I'm not really gonna bother with the converter till they properly fix it. If I have to spend an hour or more jumping through menu hoops, I'm gonna use that time on another game.
---
There didn't even need to be a points system. It could have been a simple Legendary scrapper design with set amounts for each ammo that you dump in to then produce the bulk ammo scrap we got from Vault 94 raids or that can be purchased off some wandering vendors now. Then the player can use that to craft the ammo they want and get experience from it.
---
Unfortunately a hell of a lot of the information you will find about the game is outdated due to tweaks and nerfs.
---
Don't go seeking out two shot explosive weapons and especially two shot explosive dragons (or any dragon for that matter).  
---
If a video, article or reddit post is more than about 8 months old just ignore it.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this post. Take my upvote, and support.
---
What SCORE-Rank are you at right now?
---
It's not taking away gear. You can normally upgrade your gear's power level by destroying something with a higher power level than it and "infusing" it. So if you have a gun you like, you infuse it to the power cap. They're making it so that gear will gave a limit to how high you can infuse into it, so it will just be capped at a power level that makes it unusable in end game content. The system makes sense when implemented properly, but Destiny made some odd choices with how they designed it.
---
Fabulous.
---
Its a paint applicable for the wood armour. You can't craft wood armour but it can be found and then you can apply the ghillie paint to it.
---
At the fence.
---
Outfits?
---
Or Sun Kissed.
---
AH thank you! Makes sense.
---
What you going to play now ?
---
I dont see the predatory part of this.  Grind get shit.  Dont grind dont get shit.  They award you enough atoms to buy 9 levels.  I know I've only been playing since f03(did go back for 1 and part of 2) and I dont have beta, plus or definitely not morrowind chops.  But I've been pumping quarters and paychecks into my hobby for along time.  This doesn't top the top 25 percent of this is a money grab.  But that's just me.  I just play the game and haven't missed a single event outfit of decoration.
---
It took me almost three hours last night to convert 6000 rounds of .38, 5700 rounds of 10mm, and 9000 rounds of .45 into roughly 1000 rounds of 5mm
---
I got 2 floater grenades off a cargobot that I shot down over whitesprings. Might've been added in.
---
No, the power armor glitch isn’t working. I’m going to try to glitch under the map with the staircase glitch. See if I can get under then up to get in
---
Nice try, Todd
---
Everybody loves you when you share the bloody mess perk.
---
I feel like with every update the game gets more buggy and more laggy. 😠.
---
&gt;"Simple BGS parent company investors were in the middle of a buy out. Or at least attempting to. "

That's a pretty wild claim that should be easily provable from multiple sources. A cursory googling provides a single article from 2020, which basically points to an anonymous reddit post claiming Sony was buying out Zenimax and says "LOL you're an idiot if you believe that."   Given that Sony is a publicly traded company, that info would definitely be out there if true.
---
So do you have a citation for the claim that Zenimax "investors" were "in the middle of a buy out. Or at least attempting to."
---
Dunno, I scrapped a bunch of junk last night and got 2 levels. I didn't even complete a weekly or daily from the junk I got when I scrapped. And I hadn't done anything special before scrapping.
---
The biggest thing I'd like to point out is IT'S FREE CONTENT!!! How an individual values their own time is on them. Is it possible to get everything? Yes. Does it require a lot of work? Yes. Do the devs make this a challenge so that maybe we'll spend some real money to skip some levels? Probably. We've gotten a lot out of a game that we haven't been forced to put extra money in to. EA forces people to pay extra all the time and their playerbase waits with open mouths to imbibe whatever little morsels ejaculate from the EA spout. Bethesda gives free content and their "fans" can't wait to tell all of their other "fans" how shitty it is while their hands firmly grasp each other's privates and simultaneously achieve their furious orgasms.
---
Sadly no......
---
It doesn’t stop me doing what I want to do, but I certainly have some FOMO so wanting to get most things in the season means I’m gonna have to do a ton of grinding that I don’t find enjoyable. But hey, if you’re happy with the seasons that’s good, I know not everyone is gonna feel the way I do about them.
---
Its annoying if you have a lot of crops but just scrap them. You get back the crop and can just replant it without looking for more
---
nah, just trying to do it myself.
---
i did get two in a row once though. Out of 20 so.. there's that.
---
It's a gun plan and once you know the plan the guns can drop. Highly sought after with the right prefixes of course.
---
Pro-tip: scrap the crop and replant for free
---
Yeah and if they screwed this up so bad imagine what the Perk Loadout system is gonna be like :-(.....
---
The wikis pretty much seem to have given up due to the constant changes.  Stuff like where to find items is fairly accurate (mostly).  Other stuff like what components are needed to mod power armor are just completely off to the point they aren't helpful at all.
---
I love love the new season. I don’t care if I don’t earn everything: making all things easily available to everyone is reducing their value. 
---
And oh my god more people actually play the game: there are people in events, not only 1-3 people. Soloing Line in the Sand was getting old and costly. 
---
All in all, really happy with the update. My only complain would be the ammo machine whose interface works like an old ‘80s DnD Golden Box game. It has to change for sure.
---
cannot, yet. credit card purchases are locked out for the first two weeks... or so said bethesda.
---
The thing with MMOs is they WANT you to play every day. Many MMOs will have daily activities that are basically chores, but help you progress or readers you for simply logging on. If you miss a day, it coould reset streaks or you could fall behind others who play every day.
---
That's how MMOs have been for a long time, and I don't see it changing with FO76
---
If you play Nuclear Winter, just wait till you put on your next Wood Armor set :-) It auto favorited it for me and I couldn't figure out why I looked so dope
---
Yeah, they changed the icons back to the standard blue icons so its harder to find the workshops now. You can't fast travel unless you have taken them over tho. Its a weird change but i do enjoy that they changed the Rusty Pick icon.
---
I’ve played for about seven hours so far in the new seasons, a little today and some yesterday, and I’m rank seven so far. I think a lot of it has been that repeatable XP that’s been moving me along so quickly. Been doing a lot of events while grouped up and buffed with XP food and good rest, on top of working my way through the main quest line, so a ton of XP there too
---
 its account wide, but the consumables you receive will be character only, so if you unlock some repair kits, they go to the character youre on when you unlock them on the board game.
---
"possible" with some kind of exploit or cheat maybe but no way are they doing that legit
---
Yea you get more bang for your atoms if you save them either for the last 10 ranks or the last day of the season since every rank score increases 25
---
I’m in no hurry, doesn’t seem like it’ll be hard to finish just playing the game
---
This weeks repeatable task is get XP. I wouldnt be suprised if next weeks repeatable task was "do X public events".
---
Alternate back and forth between repeatable XP and repeatable public events and the FAQ suddenly makes sense.
---
Although them forgetting to add it is just as likely.
---
So what exploit did they use?
---
My kid plays n.w for me...I consider myself blessed...I'm way to old to grind it.you get more points for camping kind of a mw2 feel to it
---
Its not a bug, its intentional. They added them to the grenade loot pool when an enemy dies. You can't trade them or craft them tho if you haven't earnt the plans yet.
---
awesome. i figured on the consumables. but im glad i dont ahve to worry about bouncing to specific characters to get specific things lol
---
Yes they use the old exploit ,Bethesda mentioned it to had repaired in this patch :)
---
The progress is shared across all characters, and the outfits/camp items/skins are as well. Currency items like scrip, caps, and gold bullion (as well as the supply box and lunch box consumables) will be given to the character you're playing on when you unlock them from the board game screen in the menu. Not sure what happens if you unlock gold bullion on a character who hasn't finished the wastelanders story, however.
---
Skins, outfits, camp items are all account wide. Consumables like repair kits and lunch boxes are not.
---
just friended you &amp; it crashed. gimme sec
---
And my feedback, sir, is that I would highly recommend Taco Bamba to any of the DC-region CMs.
---
The ghillie suit set has also been added into NW with this er...error? and those can be tracked in challenges.
---
Was just about to say this as I'd just figured it out lol.
---
HINT...read the patchnotes :) they fixxed  something :)
---
Nothing to brag about then is it
---
Oh and just wait until you guys try to use the ammo converter 😹 it’s so pathetic and horrible. Your A/X buttons will stop working after you convert your ammo due to the immense amount of times you have to spam that f***n button SMH ...Bethesda? You wanna buy me a new elite controller since you broke mine with all the laggy spam crafting and bs mechanics
---
If I planted a corn plant in real life, and the plant was damaged, dumping shit on it wouldn't fix it. I'd need to dig it out and replant a new one.
---
I have a job, family, mortgage. 
---
I played for a few hours last night. Made it to rank 12. 
---
It’s been out for a little over 24 hours. How about giving it some time before you start panicking to gauge if you can achieve all ranks.
---
Selling your ammo and making a weekly trip to lucky mine for lead is objectively better than this ammo converter. So not only is the item bad because the conversion rate is abysmal, it has the most time consuming and cumbersome user interface in a game built out of time consuming and cumbersome interfaces. If you're satisfied with the ammo converter, like legitimately tolerant and shoulder shruggingly satisfied, you have low ass standards and your opinion on the matter doesn't do anything but support a bad standard. Everybody complaining is fully justified, whereas ho hum tolerance like yours honestly isn't. Stop making excuses for these people.
---
I'm at level 4.my internet sucks spectrum drops every 20 mins so I need to stay on private worlds so I can jump back in to finish events if I do public I cant rejoin the last server.it sucks but hey level 4
---
Wendigo colossus has been in the game 2 months. That event, however is delayed.
---
Hard agree. All the other mobile game tactics are subtle compared to this blatant daily retention grab /further atom squeeze
---
Yup. I'm 3k short now. 3 of the 1000 point challenges didn't take over the last 2 days. The notification popped up on completion, it's greyed out on the challenges menu as complete, but blue points bar didn't move. Log off/on still didn't move.
---
Rank 11 here
---
- Did 8/10 dailies: I don’t play Nuclear Winter
---
- Just finished the weekly. I am now on xp repeatable
---
I mean, thematically it would make sense giving that floaters are also FEV creature and they tend to hang out with super mutants, but realistically I think they just got added to the loot tables by accident
---
AND they just disabled stackable punji boards 😂
---
Its only possible to earn this through scrapping gatling lasers at a weapons workbench. Best way is to learn the gatling laser weapon plans and craft them and scrap them until you learn it.
---
You need to level up 1 more time. First one doesn’t count for whatever reason.
---
You clearly have issues. 
---
Calling someone a “gay bitch” is a homophobic slur &amp; as such is against the rules of Reddit. Free speech does not protect hate speech. Clearly you are a moronic troll who loves Bethesda far too much.
---
Good luck, I’ll let the mods decide.
---
Honestly, I came back for Wastelanders, and I think I'm uninstalling when I get home. This game has barely changed in nearly 2 years, and I can't believe people defend Bethesda for this.
---
Damn ok.ok
---
Still those people brag about it.. NAd they dont get banned...  Its a shame
---
Yeah, Bethesda changed the symbols so they are the same blue icons as before. I thought you could only fast travel there once you claimed it. Might be a bug...
---
OmG. Thank you!!
---
Pro-tip: That requires me to go into build mode, which sucks. May as well make me fast travel.
---
the barrel clips inside the tri attachments.
---
So basically the entire game
---
In complete honesty the whole thing just reeks of Bethesda coming up with the solution of us  paying atoms for a catch up method to me at some point in the near future, as much as it pains me to say it.
---
I like the idea of a seasonal pass, and some of the rewards look cool, but there is absolutely zero chance of me getting anywhere near completion of this and my motivation has gone already to even try
---
God mode lad
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
Quite a few people across various threads have noted this Season Pass is actually extremely tightly gated and harsh. Many can be 'completed' in weeks if you are a natural grinder/play long stretches but less regularly, others have 'catch up' options, and others still have easy to reach finales but then stretch rewards if you want to keep going. Most directly count xp earned towards progress without a repeatable; just a direct and more favourable conversion.
---
These Seasons require you to do your Dailies and Weekly every day if you want to get to the end, no breaks, and any breaks have to be made up with either grinding hundreds of thousands of xp in the repeatable or paying.
---
Intent to engage isn't enough. Even if you have the desire and will to go all the way to Rank 100 a family illness, net outage, or combination of life events means it's just not happening. That's where the predatory part is. Imagine you've played an hour every single day and get to Rank 65... two months of making sure to do these tasks every morning/evening... and you come down with the flu. You miss a week of logins. In later Ranks that is literally MILLIONS of xp *or the price of a single pizza*. Or just give up, shrug, and move on despite all the work so far. Be honest; you know exactly which option is the most tempting.
---
Please do not bring realism into this, else I'll ask you to explain the conditions in which you can and can't use a terminal in power armor and how, beyond all comprehension, the right-hand palm-pad is for your left hand.
---
You forgot "dress Smiley in a ghille suit"
---
This is the annoying part. I want the annoying part to go away.
---
Now my mom has to bring the hot pockets and pizza rolls down to the basement 😩😡
---
I wouldn't mind spending 100 hours to get to level 100. It's going to take much much more than that.
---
90, 60, 40 doesn’t seem to add up (mod that boosts all three that I am unaware of?).  Also, only 39 caps for uny 20% ammo red +1 str is psycho bonkers, especially since they know the  general market price for serums...
---
Edit: 90, 60, 60 that is
---
Edit edit:  I am a fool apparently. 90, 60, 60 is base for SS chest piece.  I had the limb values in my head.
---
Every change they make is another nail in the coffin.
---
I really wish they took a different approach to this game, right from the start. It didn't get nearly as much of a finish as it should have had at release, and has been mishandled since.
---
Thats an odd price tbh
---
Rank seven. Not encouraging since the levels are linearly frontloaded (1000 score at 1 vs ~3500 at 99; rush of weekly events doesn't help)
---
? It takes two seconds.
---
Exp exploit.
---
adrenaline is broken...
---
This is also true
---
Yeah, i hate trap camps really, they just want to see your junk and camps. Its quite sad to hear, Bethesda just needs to bring back Survival mode to get rid of them over to that mode.
---
Hop on the royale it is very very fun
---
I rolled a bloodied handmade with 10% damage while aiming and 25% less vats last night. It's all luck of the draw and given I'm a full health build I can appreciate the value but it's still not useful to my character where I'm sure others would be giddy with joy over that roll. Value is perceptive but the luck of rng gods will favour you one day
---
What's your point in posting this?
---
How long did it take? I've been going for the rewards for about 3 days now and I'm just 1/3rd of the way there
---
See ya in a month when the new content drops
---
for some reason i stopped getting score from doing challenges after level 6
---
Played lots of township without ever opening my wallet.  Dont think this will break me.  
---
Edit: Premature Send
---
Understood. Its a stupid mechanic given that we cant very well store crops for repairs either since they spoil
---
You clearly have mental issues that no other human being in this planet has to suffice with.
---
Hating on others art is not good and can be taken seriously. Your obviously probably a troll since your hating for no reason. I have reported this to the mods as well and they will decide wether or not to ban you or not. Your just a child and have yet to understand what fallout 76 the Bethesda Luxury title has to offer. 
---
Good luck and I hope your banned soon.
---
Trying to balance a full time job and 3 hours travel a day. I kinda cbf playing when I get home.cause I'm so tired therefore I miss out of some.dailies and even weeklies at times. It comes down to two options at that point, give Beth some of my money (as an apprentice I don't have a lot to be begin with) or suck it up. I'm not a bust my balls completionist nor am I someone whos gonna grind over all weekend (I think they call my type a filthy casual). It's been two days since the update and Im already thinking what's the point if I have to do every daily every weekly and spend my atoms. It's a very cheeky design if it's on purpose. And yeah I get the better rewards are higher levels, that's how progression works but don't make it suck a tight gap where it feels like I've got two full time jobs to juggle. ( Im getting that chicken coop then I'm outtie)
---
Devil's advocate here. This game wants to make money and be set up like a Games as a Service model, although I hate it, it it what it is. They already give people enough in the way of free ways to earn atoms that you really don't need to spend unless you want EVERY SINGLE THING that pops up on the atom store. Which I certainly don't. So, yeah, if you want to not spend money, that's the option. Just like with every other gsmes as a service game. It's not an optimal system, here or otherwise, but that's what we've agreed to playing.    
---
Wastelanders was definitely not end-game geared content. Yes, bullion did give everyone something to work for, but Wastelanders was the No Man's Sky NEXT update of Fo76. Designed to improve upon what a lot of people complained about the base game. Could it have been more integrated into the existing story? Yes probably. But doing so would've tainted the experience for people who had already done parallel questlines.     
---
In all honesty, the game needs two things. Sweeping bug fixes akin to unofficial patches, and actual new areas. I don't mean a raid, as I've heard how dissatisfied people were about that fiasco. But actual new landmasses. People still want a PvP centric zone, so an actual separate murder map still fully connected to Appalachia would be amazing. I also feel like we need to be able to explore more of the caves that these scorchbeast are coming from. Hopefully the return of the BoS will also bring with it a new scorched-centric area to explore. Give people a reason to use prime receivers all the time instead of just for Queen.    
---
The fuck up on Bethesdas end is that this update was made with new players in mind first, and loyal fanbase second
---
I personally enjoy the game
---
Lol "and do it quickly" .   As if they answer to you.
---
SO bethesda finaly starts to ban people...  For AWARNES
---
Probably a renamed piece. Still a great price for it though
---
Yeah the price had me thinking they wanted to get rid of it, didnt buy it because it might be duped or glitched.
---
no they didnt, there is still a workaround
---
That was sarcasm:)  i know :)
---
Most under rated comment.
---
Yeah i and my son and friends are both missing it. PS4 and PC. What gives. BEthesda, that was my favorite emote that i had!
---
Oh god damn it I just got back into FO76 and was excited to see this on the seasonal board. Are you fucking kidding me?! *Facepalm*
---
I would trade the new content for a fix
---
the converter requires a lot of ammo
---
Didn't you hear? While you were away, the Scourge rallied and counter attacked. They were backed by The Master, Caesar, Communist China, and Cthulhu. Sofia single handedly united the brotherhood of steel, the enclave, the NCR, Mr. House, and the nightkin into one epic super battle for the fate of the world. In the end, Sofia was promoted as 'Overlord of Earth' for her valiant heroics during the battle. Ulysses was there also. But he just kind of stood back and remained awesome.  Overall, this was the game all fallout fans hoped for. 
---
The world doesn't revolve around you - you know. Things continue to happen even when you are not there.
---
90rw doesn't even matter the rolls keep it and bust it out on bullet spongy enemies.probably take a sheepsquatch out easy with the ffr
---
About 50% of the time. I did encryptid twice earlier and didnt get any...
---
Leaves you off.
---
Yeah I found Ward sleeping, though I haven't seen him out in his garden yet, does he still wander all the way out there?
---
I’m not faulting you on that. This method is predatory, however, like I said there are tons of ways which this could have been much worser. 
---
The weekly them selves can push you past the half way Mark which I find good enough. To me I wouldn’t mind giving atoms atoms to jump around 15 game spots near the end since you can get about 1500 atoms for free if you can go through the whole board. 
---
Most long time fallout first members have more atoms then they can spend. 
---
Like I said companies are not your friends. Calling out on their predatory practices is what players should actively do as well as not to purchase these kinds of things. I can name so many other games which are so much more money hungary and people pay out thousands of dollars a week.
---
To me this game is a mix of good and bad depending on how you look at it. I find this particular game great for what is currently is.
---
For me those two completed at 3/5
---
Bethesda releasing best armour in game, realising all others are now obsolete look at releasing legendary perks that only effect the old armours that we've since ditched for new secret service requiring the grind for equipment to start all over again
---
And that's being generous, I've done both daily challenges and 80% of the weekly in 4 hours over two nights as well as all my usual dailies and numerous events on top, plus a sbq fight and faffing in my camp 'cause I accidently scrapped my cabin, woops.
---
You most likely received your points at 3/5 instead of 5/5. I received points at 3/5 on a couple of mine.
---
Tbh, I’m fine with the poor exchange rate. It needs to be that way to avoid butchering the economy. However, the exchange should be less than 5 clicks; not 500 clicks. We need a bulk exchange.
---
Damn, there goes all my materials. Thanks for the info.
---
95% chance of hitting
---
*gun jams*
---
That one in particular is a darling.  It awards you the SCORE at 3/5 for some reason.  Still a bug, but you're not missing anything thankfully.
---
If this did not happen to you, IDK.  It happened to me, and I've seen several other comment on it.  It happens with other challenges as well, though only weekly ones to my knowledge.   Or at least so far
---
Dam last night I wasn’t able to do it so I assumed it would let me do the 2 in one day and I need do it one more daily to get max rep😭
---
... I guess that’s about it.
---
My guess is strict response guidelines for the CMs and old business hirarchy in the company itself where a CM isn't allowed to respond even if they have an 'official' response to a question if they don't get told to respond to said question by their bosses.
---
This is worse than the time the mole rat got stuck in the Eat-o-tronic!
---
this is the most annoying shit in the world
---
I've seen this bug before, wouldn't let me actually purchase the armor though - which i assume would be the same situation here.
---
Interestingly it was also for an unyielding ss torso, probably just a coincidence.
---
Have you beaten the Collosus yet? The encounter has been increased from 6 to 10% and nukes are hitting the Sundew Forrest regularly so nows a good time to go hunting.
---
Grind is good. If you have story content to do along with it.
---
This game is supposed to be "lived in", so alot of what you'll do outside of quests is build camps, do events, trade etc. If you don't feel like doing any of that I'd just come back to it when something new gets added!
---
Seems to happen for all allies.  I know it happened with Space Lady™ for me, and I don't think Beckett **ever** offered me a daily quest.
---
\[Edit: clarified daily quest vs. story quest for Beckett\]
---
The survival mode failed because those types of players couldn't handle legit fights.
---
This isn’t an airport no need to announce your departure
---
I hope so! I noticed that with some of the others so you're probably right.
---
With your D-D-DD-DDD-Deck?
---
What's so funny?
---
About a week. Just solo queue and find a good Bush to nap in.
---
Maybe.... Maybe OP is Caesar.....
---
Maybe your advice is what led to the formation of the legion.
---
Yeah let’s cry over how unfair free content is. 
---
Pff kids these days.
---
It's this, experienced the same thing as you but I had gotten my level from it earlier...
---
Personally for me I think I can get to around level 75-80 the highest item I want is the Dark Matter skin for the combat rifle. But if necessary ill buy the rest of the way. Once you hit 70-80 spending atoms isn't that bad
---
Just a theory, but I think they accidentally gave everyone the tricentennial salute emote for free, then removed it with the last update.
---
It's so bad. After watching a vid that covered it I'm glad I didn't get it. Please folks, don't support it. Like op said it's unbelievably buggy even for beth. Like no one tested it at all.
---
It was meant for only the people that bought the tricentennial edition of the game. A bug a while ago gave it to everyone, and got fixed.
---
As somebody who plays the mode consistently. The only way you're getting 700xp for just hitting top 10 is if you're getting 10-20 kills. 
---
I get around 1k per win, and if I dont win I get anywhere between 600-700 for 2nd place but under 2nd place I get way less
---
I am with you on this one. I have 3 builds completed, all just shy of lvl 200 each. I've done the quests, done the events so many times. Ive hunted for the gear for each build. And was excited for this new map and team thing they added. I jumped on today and really could not keep myself entertained. I hope they add new quests. Not just one or two but a few. 
---
I'd say try different builds would be the best bet to extend your interest. Different build are fun to work towards making out.
---
Its on a 3/5 glitch, If you add up your points to your SCORE lvl you'll see it matches. I spent an hour last night stressing 
---
For now, if the mission asks for 5/5 completed, it will pay out at 3/5 but still show as an active challange
---
Server hopping make any difference?
---
makes the “plant X at a camp or workshop” really fat though :)
---
🏅 This is an award from a poor man lol
---
I find it all funny. The terrible systems, you guys bitching about em. Its all hilarious, i enjoy the game, have since launch. Im a daily player and the new seasons rank grind thing is fine.
---
Yeah i just tried to purchase it after reading your comments, and wasnt able too.
---
Someone quickly find a way to dupe \[insert currency/item\] with a buggy VATS.
---
So weird, but I'll take it.
---
I'm under the impression that you couldn't change the name of starred items, any time I have tried it wouldn't let me
---
The super mutants have learned from Grahm and are starting to visit player CAMPS to do their shopping. That super mutant must have picked up the plan for it during one of these shopping sprees.
---
I agree with this post so much. Nothing exciting anymore. Just grind ...
---
I'll try that!
---
If they got you to play 3000+ hours, clearly they know something.
---
Survival mode failed because it became over run with food builds who wouldn't fight and only there for the xp boost and cowards hiding in the newly indestructible camps
---
So you don't buy the peanut butter...the peanut butter is still 62.40. Just because you don't agree with the price doesn't make it not 62.40. If you do buy it you get a bunch of shit to make up the difference.. either way the peanut butter was actually free, and so is all the other shit.
---
Its not like you can spend the free atoms elsewhere. The atom market is literally determined by Beth and nobody else, they choose what value to place on their items.
---
