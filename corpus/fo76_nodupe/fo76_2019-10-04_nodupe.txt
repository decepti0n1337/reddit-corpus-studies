?? How is there meat cleavers on the ground and not in a brown lunch bag??

sorry to say, but it's not recent, i've been stuck on this for the possum badge since the badges came out. And i've posted and reported about it the first month, and have since just moved on. It'll get fixed when it gets fixed, I'm pretty sure the coders would fix it on 2 seconds.  But it all comes down to Management priorities, and i'm too cynical to think it's high enough to matter yet.
---
I Havn't tried the time modes yet. I am looking for some seasons psn vets that are willing to show ke the ropes of that god forsaken place lol.
---
One time I was doing okay with killing a sheepsquatch. I was going through tons of ammo and stims, and a scorched beast showed up and killed me.
---
Well, you just lost out on 40% more crap, from my experience.  
---
I feel your loss.
---
disabling aric will make the animals aggressive to enemies and heal between rounds.  
---

---
If your goal is to get the best rewards it's a bad idea to disable aric.  Even though they heal in between rounds they aggro everything and are more likely to die. You can only get the best rewards like bear arm mod plans if all 3 friendly animals survive.  
---
If your only goal is to complete the event successfully and you don't care about getting the best rewards, then disabling aric can make that easier so long as you don't have a lot of firepower in each biome.  
---
Generally speaking I think the best approach is to let ARIC run the experiment and just have 2+ people per biome with strong damage guard the friendlies.  This gives you the best chance to have all 3 survive.
---
Lode Barring is the only Public Event that's in the Ash Heap, which should imply that all the others still work as they usually do.
---
I think the underlying problem is that most players simply don't have a reason to go to the Ash Heap, and so many of the events don't trigger.
---
I've been in on a few sub-15 second queen kills we did with unarmed melee. Not saying you can't do that with rifles but I sure haven't seen it.
---
lol  
---
Well, unless you got a ton of melee weapons, you still got a reasonable deal.
---
Well you are asking for a more complex community event... which sounds like development would be needed...
---
I didn't go hardcore, but rolled 3-4 per day (including many failures with no rewards). Got 2 tenderizers, 2 salt and 1 pepper mod. All about that RNG.
---
*Fine*, I'll do the quest. But I won't like it, goddamn it.
---
Melee is undoubtedly broken for damage I'll admit, but as I said before. If I wanted to swing a sword id play elder scrolls.
---
Soldier's on the front line don't swing swords today, so I don't want to either.
---
Hoping for trick or treat evevt
---
That would piss me off. I love my all rise.
---
I’m ranked 169 and I’ve made multiple characters I do vault raids everyday with my friends and just grind to get cool and rare items yeah sometimes it gets very boring but you just need to find a group of friends and play as a team
---
It was and still is a dead ass game ever since launch. Just totally boring. It's not fallout at all
---
That can't be RNG there must be weighting.
---
I feel ya, but on the other hand, there's always someone that just got the game starting new and asking for help. I always try to help them out, especially thise trying to do their first silo run or sbq. I find it hilarious when all hell breaks loose and they panic to where I need to calm them down.
---
**I would attend this party!!**
---
Don’t ask who Joe is
---
Oops I meant keypad not keycard
---
I'm hoping the wastelanders update unlocks a couple more.
---
I respect your opinion on not liking this fallout yrgame but pls post your opinions somewhere else, I'm looking insights from other players here and not some random who jumped on the hate train
---
Same... I kept getting flashbacks to Skyrim... I've been playing on mute for about 3 months now lol
---
Breach and clear is a "community event" meaning that if somone loots the drill before you there is a chance you get nothing.
---
Fly swatter and battle bots are over in seconds. Messenger actually works here and brings lots of mobs.  But players are use to it not working or giving good rewards so its avoided. And the other one load bearing is pretty good but now it's on a timer. So they mostly get avoided a lot.
---
I have 1900 hours I still enjoy doing the daily missions and running my farming path but wastelanders cant come fast enough
---
1900 hours is a HUGE amount, I'm nearing the 500 hour mark but I'd say at least 10 hours of that is me sitting on a cliff edge watching the view
---
I've been doing Nuclear Winter for all the rewards and holotape, but once I finish that I think that gamemode's dead for me.  I'm also grinding events for all the super-rare outfits, but that feels futile with how utterly impossible that is.  Really hoping Wastelanders revitalizes my routine in this game.  \[Also as a solo player I have no way of doing the Vault Raids, and it makes me sad because I really, really want those rewards.\]
---
If you're on xbox i'd be happy to help you with vault raids this week, but the next 2 weeks of raids are annoying missions so I won't be doing them
---
[deleted]
---
Wow this is depressing.  If literally no one is interested I'm going back to buying out the machines of camps I admire.  
---
I think Reddit is the problem.  Now that I have dream armor and flux for days it's time to quit Reddit.
---
Hated dropping nukes from the start..."heres a huge ammo sink for a solo player....lets follow it up with another ammo sink..."  Great logic.
---
Is that true with ballistic damage too? It seems like my numbers from the same gun vary a lot on different enemy types.
---
I agree that they are both ammo sinks, however I live on a steel node and my friend lives on a lead node so I'm fine for ammo
---
After not noticing it in the damage numbers I took it off for a while and didn’t really think much of it. For Meat Week I put it back on, because stealth is pretty much nonexistent at the Primal Cuts events and I wanted all the help I could get. I still didn’t see it in the numbers, but I definitely noticed the difference on the really tough enemies. 
---
Perhaps it’s not showing in the floating damage numbers, but still working in the background? Maybe I just saw what I wanted to see? I don’t know, but I definitely had an easier time handing the big beasts without stealth this time around.
---
Nah, I'm on PC, thanks so much for the offer though!
---
Thanks for the advice. I’ve been trying to focus on one biome to get one high level friendly but the rewards are shit! So this makes a lot of sense. I will say it seems like it’s harder than it was when they first put it in game. I wish more people did it!
---
Throw them.
---
Sniff my zebra
---
Is my gamer tag, I’m down
---
Sniff my zebra is my gamertag
---
Spittin true facts
---
Lets see your CAMP. Bet I'd win.
---
Join a player faction- I’m with wasteland republic and they are super cool
---
Are you referring to PvP damage?
---
I think so
---
You are only really losing damage compared to the absolutely busted prefix's. 
---
Mutants is just a good reliable damage boost, with no real difficulties or costs, which makes it one of the better effects overall. Mainly because many mutations are too good to not use.
---
Junkies, anti armor, bloodied, and "mighty" are the only prefixes that are just straight better than it, and one of those is unobtainable.
---
That's the spirit, you'll be added to the list.  Judging will probably begin in a few days.
---
I understand that Wastelanders/Atomic-Shop are taking top priority, but why is every update one step forward and 3 back since this summer? Old bugs re-introduced etc. Ty for addressing the latest bug so quickly for “Mystery Pick” but, Please fix the base game bugs etc. this narrative is getting old, fast
---
Yes, not too long ago, Bethesda fixed it so that all Legendaries you get should be scaled to your level. Picked up or bought from the Purveyor. However, they are some case of still getting weapons way above your level, but what can you do, it’s Bethesda.
---
Yes
---
You can't place anything in the artillery container tho, why would they do this?
---
Off topic question, how did you get that little free states badge next to your name. That is awesome lol
---
I think it's supposed to have low ballistic damage because it's intended to be among the best pvp weapons.  Idk if it is or not, but it's still horrible that we can't ever modify them.
---
Oh so, if I’m looking for like level 5 stuff... my lvl 3 mule won’t pull all lvl 1 or 5 pieces because it’s the closest appropriate lvl?
---
I highly recommend making a new character. It completely reinvigorated the game for me. It's nice to have play-style options, and switch characters when over-weight and waiting for scrip and cap limits to reset. It also let me use some cool legendaries that didn't fit my first character's build.
---
I need someone to give me a hand too so maybe we can help out each other, ill probably be on this weekend so I’ll send you an invite
---
Really enjoyed the video, great views, sorry you had to move.
---
Sniff my zebra is gamertag.
---
Fair warning tho, I’m one of the best on this game when it comes to getting my ass beat
---
So much for your "opinion", lol. Figured as much.
---
Maybe just good ol' RNG again.
---
&gt;3\* suppressor
---
I'll look into that one, thanks, hate to be wasting points.
---
No worries, I’m not the best either, I’m just a lvl 21 and I’ve been solo so far
---
You should be getting pieces around that level, it’s just that there have been bugs where low levels are still getting high level Legendaries they can’t use. I can only offer the advice to try it once in the purveyor and if you get low levels then good, if not, try resetting the game.
---
Just another glich to add to all the rest. Same happened to me. but when u click transfer on the box u see them in there but when u go to grab 1 they never enter ur invantory.
---
I'm not sure, but I suppose it could just be a melee issue. There is also damage dropoff depending on target range, though.
---
15 rad damage per shot is not going to change the game in pvp given how easy it is to heal that with a radaway or block most of it with radx, radshield, or pa.  Plus recoil is more important in PvP than it is in pve and the RR has shit recoil.
---
I mean, feel free to prove me wrong and go on a kill crazy pvp rampage with your radium rifle - I'm sure you can win some fights especially if you know what you're doing but not any more than you would have anyway if you just used a fixer or handmade instead.
---
Me too, at about 4 this afternoon went there w 600 scrip, no mystery picks and no discounts.  Only decent role was an AA .50 cal.  Want 150 scrip back.
---
Thanks for pointing me to this post, there's quite a bit to get my *math challenged* head around but it looks like as I head to getting my build to my liking Tenderizer is a perk I'm going to leave well alone and trust the numbers.
---
I'm very grateful  :)
---
I'll help you out, but can it be in a few hours?
---
 ... and got a sweeeet Junkie’s Lead Pipe. But seriously, mad props on your first Solo Squatch!
---
r/averageredditor
---
I did test and verify that the two shot radium rifles deal double the rad damage.  Not that it changes much.
---
It happens when you switch to Adventure after playing Nuclear Winter.  You'll have to restart the game to fix it.
---
Short answer yes, long answer maybe. I wasn’t going to, except I dabbled in nuclear winter. My main didn’t have the right perk points and I didn’t want to change everything around. I went from a melee on the main to a power armor wearing heavy gunner. I grabbed a bloodied handmade on my alternate. I can tell you for a fact that these changes are awesome and add new life into the game!
---
For a console I imagine. eBay is around $30. Some games stores are cheaper if they have lots of inventory.
---
Ok mines KSI ToxxicDucky I’ll be on tomorrow
---
Sounds good.
---
I use whitesprings &amp; charlston capital building as it spawns 2  3* legendaries.
---
Are you on ps4? I have an extra
---
But then I spent so many nights thinking how survivor mode did wrong
---
I got mine brand new on Amazon for 17 bucks 💯
---
Edit: it's a bit more now but I see it in the 20s on there sorry
---
Cool thanks! How much time do you recon it takes to get the 150 scrip?
---
I felt good killing my first a couple weeks ago. It was a rough battle. Now I just run up and melee solo them daily. Lol
---
RENEGADE3-2
---
Had one who was invulnerable track and kill me at the Bootlegger's Shack in the Bog today.
---
30rads is still not going to change the game and now that gun has shit recoil AND accuracy thanks to the 2 shot effect.  
---
I guess my point is a 2 shot handmade or fixer would have served you better and you can easily learn all the mods for those without spending hundreds of hours and farming 10k+ screws.
---
Try 50 cal machine gun.  Should work well against any but legendary
---
&gt;way to avoid the glitch without giving up on using the mentioned weapons
---
You mentioned that you have a bunch of explosive weapons that you can't use because of this bug so I was providing you with the information that the tesla rifle was the problem. For the most part many of the weapons that used to trigger the damage bug have been fixed (intentional or not) so their likelihood of causing this issue is almost a non-factor; exceptions to this are:  
---
1) Flammers  
---
2) Tesla Guns (particularly auto version, the only good mod)  
---
3) Explosive shotguns  
---
4) Legacy weapon (ex. explosive gatling lasers, etc.)  
---
5) High RoF weapons while wearing Strangler PA.   
---
6) Some melee weapons? ( I don't use melee seriously so I have only heard this)   
---
Basically by using these weapons you are putting yourself at risk for triggering this bug. By avoiding using these weapons your other explosive weapons are not very likely to trigger the bug and are for the most part fairly usable. I would not hold your breath on waiting for a fix because this seems like a very difficult bug to address since it is likely caused by the engine itself.
---
I ended up buying it from someone's vendor for 100 caps. Then I found the salty mod at a raider encampment. Going to add the mod then sell it myself, don't have much use for it
---
It takes me 20 min per day to max out my daily scrip
---
Translation: I would like it if it were to be that way. To end and eradicate the plague in the wasteland and make it a safe place where people can live peacefully.
---
Have every gun but that one... Will pay anything for it or trade, I have hundreds of flux and a few sets of Cav/Sentinel/Powered armor. PS4?
---
No I don’t do that.  I think I completed primal cuts with you once in the Cranberry Bog.  My PSN is different from my name on here.
---
Yeah but like in a bunker or town where the enemy's can destroy workshops and the defenders have to fall back and can't build there anymore. And something like uranium fever in that once they destroy the final objective at the end they win. Also once a workshop is destroyed the attackers now spawn there.
---
Yeah I planned on using my quad ffr fr radium anyway, vs low hp pvp players at least.  Just wish I could mod it.  There's no point in using it in pve if I can't put a suppressor on it.
---
Came across a lvl 100 when trying to solo a prime meat event, it killed me about 10 times and I ran out of time but I eventually got my zealot sickle...
---
This is what I refer to as the "damage desync" bug. It seems to be caused by hitting multiple targets at the same time, too quickly. The server and client seem to get out of sync, so your client shows the damage you should be dealing, but the server lost track of one of your previous hits, and rejects every projectile hit from that point onwards (your client will keep resetting back to what the server says the target's health should be).
---
The only way to avoid this bug is to slow down your rate of fire (depending on the server's responsiveness) whenever you're hitting multiple targets.
---
Translation: I was thinking the same thing, but when new people start playing the game with the new DLC they wont see the Scorchbeasts nor the Queen, so they will be bored and not have much reason to play the game.
---
Science 2 can make them cheaper to craft i believe
---
Yeah they're rare but Fallout 4 had them too.
---
Dam! Nice! Do you do the run on the same server or do you jump around alot?
---
I jump alot
---
Does it still have the unobtainable heavy mod?
---
Happens at breach and clear. Just hear the beeping.
---
Si pero cuando vienes el nuevo dlc vamos a tener enemigos nuevos y nueva historias y nueva objectivos para entretener nos.
---
It's like a stock super sledge now
---
Which one of my campaign were you at? The one in the mire?
---
Pure speculation but I wouldn’t be surprised if you select your chapter before joining the world. Where we currently select Adventure Mode and Nuclear Winter, we will choose Chapter 1, Chapter 2, or Nuclear Winter (however they would rename current adventure mode into a chapter 1 label)
---
I won’t be free till tomorrow sadly
---
Mutant's plus the +10% damage while aiming effect for the second tier of legendary is actually not so bad. Flat +20% damage if it's on a weapon you should expect to be ADSing with exclusively (AR, Hunting Rifle, Gauss Rifle). While not superb, it's still a solid straight-up damage increase with nothing funky going on for different situations or enemy types.
---
Looking for a Bloodied + Explosive Handmade, though. Shoot yourself in the foot, go to town.
---
You can do the three repeatable events each day for a chance to earn possum badges. It's about a 25% for me to get a badge.
---
Can't wait till Bethesda adds Perk Loadouts. PA &amp; NoPA are two that I've already been kinda pre-planning in my head. This list will definitely help me make sure I'm not wasting space on a bunk card. Much appreciated.
---
A ghoul chased me in flat woods and I killed it so hard it fell into the ground and teleported back to where it spawned aka those like 2 tents
---
PC, unfortunately.
---
If your on Xbox I’ll play with you I’ll even help you know spawns for stuff
---
Should always drop 3 stars... unfortunately that's not the case...
---
If you are in reddit app, go to the main page for the sub and click 3 dots in top right corner and select change user flair
---
Besides junkies, anti-armor, and bloodied, I'd rank mutants below instigating, furious, quad, and executioners in most cases. Those affixes also lack notable downsides. I rate mutants as inferior to more than a few "busted" perks. 
---
I agree that everyone past level 31 is mutated and the mutants affix is typically better than single-enemy affixes or the three trash tier affixes (berserkers, stalkers and nocturnal), but that's a low bar to clear.
---
My gunslinger carries a quad assaultron head for this cases. Just find shelter and get ready for a long, boring, reloading version of a fight. 
---
However, today I saw a glowing lvl 76 yao guai kill a sheepsquatch and 4 supermutants. Those bears are tough, tough, tough...
---
Yeah, it’s bugged. It seems like one weekly challenge is always finicky, for anyone and everyone.
---
Do you have it set to what you only have the materials for (can craft)?
---
Good opportunity to get a good weapon now.
---
You throw them they stay on the ground?? Looks like I’ll be making a few more... time to block up the door...lol
---
NW is probably the most balanced game mode ever lol
---
LMAO, that's the exact one I'm talking about. I don't think I was ever there doing it by myself. But she is definitely stronger than I thought she would be. That poison she spits is the icing on top of the cake though. And for some reason after she would kill me I would spawn back in right under her and couldn't do anything. I was already dead by the time I realized what was happening. Lol
---
Yep, she nasty. If luck prevails, you can cripple her spouts quickly and then her legs. After that, let's hope you have a high DPS weapon. Start to finish, I could kill a Primal Cuts legendary alpha Mirelurk Queen solo in about 20-30 seconds. More like 10 seconds if I skip crippling her.
---
Must be on PC primarily I have it on xbox and don't notice any hiccups but it definitely needs to be optimized better on pc the armor takes too long to craft for that to be the outcome.
---
Yes. But, with min/max builds I can kill one in 1 melee hit or about 2 seconds of gunfire.
---
Don't tell us, just report them, and be done with it.
---
Did you take evidence or anything?
---
Gotta clean house.
---
All kidding aside I could kill the Legendary Sheepsqautch no problem. But the Mirelurk Queen I don't think I ever went up against her without her at least killing me once. And in my mind the Sheepsqautch should be the stronger of the two.
---
I’ve never killed one, been killed twice, did he drop a legendary weapon or armor piece?

Kinda like NV and I think if I remember correctly fallout 3.
---
I had a couple harass my wife and I while we were passing by a Workshop. Unfortunately for them we're both equipped with explosive legendaries. We wasted them in self defense and took their stuff.
---
I appreciate the response, but it turns out the problem boils down to two things:  
---
1.) my brother needs to be clearer with what he has purchased, and is ergo a dingus  
---
2.) apparently scrapping other limbs for sets of armor gives you mods for the other pieces  
---
Imma delete this thread but upvote you
---
I reported them before I crashed. Doubt anything will be done though, cause that's how Bethesda is.
---
Really that’s interesting I’ve got 5 characters 2 3 completes 1 won’t work and 1 I haven’t tried yet.  How many times have you tried powering up a plant?  I did the Poseidon and thunder mtn and gave up.
---
Yeah, got a few screenshots. Bethesda likely won't do anything, they aren't to worried about these things for whatever reason.
---
Damn😭, thanks for responding tho
---
Good you found out what was wrong.
---
Minor changes will happen, and it will be another quest line either after the Overseer line, or alongside it. My guess is alongside it and separate, with nothing being affected from each other.
---
They've acted pretty fast in the past when they have a verified dupe method.
---
Punished?  Way to be dramatic about it.  A bug is just that, a bug.  Don't take it so personal.
---
Plenty of time to build the scrip back up.
---
No, it was still the same 40/15/5 and 24/9/3 as usual.
---
I’ve always thought it boosts the legendary effects, just from the eye test. Interesting to know the game files back that up
---
Because guys are alpha dogs,not alpha cats.but Mr. Pebbles has been to space,and probably has chicks all over the solar system.
---
The problem with execution animations in a multiplayer gameplay with no time pause or slow like previous fallouts is being stuck in an animation while other mobs continue to attack you. If ppl thought sitting in a chair in battle was infuriating, just wait till u accidentally initiate or automatically depending on implementation, perform an execution and then die from other mobs while your toon is chopping a head off. Not to say executions arent in other multiplayer games but they generally have a cancel or “teching” feature to give the player control of it. Something that would be difficult to implement into the current control scheme of fallout.
---
Along with my other perks, I can tank a legendary lv 80 sheepsquatch with 1 stimpack.
---
Okay, that makes sense. I tried looking up some info on this type of duping, but came up with no luck, so it must not be very well known.
---
Bethesda still hasn't unbanned the very first ban wave. They don't fuck around with duping.
---
You, good sir, are being blessed by the gods.  They are smiling upon you.
---
They've said new players can go through all the original main story if you want or skip straight to Wastelanders.
---
If the trailer and news are anything to go by, the Toxic Valley is the main area Wastelanders will take place in (the crashed spacestation is where the Raider base will be set up, and the settlers will take over a farm and there's a few of them around the north west side of the Forest they can do)  Neither of which the original main story affects.
---
Haha idiots
---
Well I'm glad to know this.
---
Confirm. Thanks!
---
I don't really get the idea some people have that that this game is meant to be played 24/7.  Play it as you enjoy it, dip out if you want to do other games and wait until the next content update drops then come back for a month or two.
---
Congratulations, don't feel bad. I am in the same boat. Lol. My wife hasn't left me yet, my friends think the game is a joke, and always make fun of me. My in laws would not understand, even if I  explained it to them, and if they did understand, they would probably think I was talking about the cold war. That's why we have our second family here, and in the game. I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
Yvw
---
Had them show up at 'bots on parade' once
---
Hopefully this pinhead get booted before getting to enjoy themselves.
---
Nothing worse than going AFK while you're at a vendor. So inconsiderate.
---
Yep have those mole rats appear every time for me during breach and clear and bots on parade (if enemies that spawn are mole miners instead of scorched)
---
I'm gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum.. Cause I'm all out a water and food.
---
are you kidding? it's all over youtube. Its been going on since the start of meat week. Steel duping glitch. Have you even looked at how cheap steel is right now? how many bulk steel and mines White Springs train station vendor has?
---
at Al's tattoo parlor
---
Play instruments while on nukashine?
---
It's in Al's tattoo parlor
---
It's one of the ones I'm getting daily or almost daily. I can't get Trick or Treat? to trigger, though, so I'd believe that daily quests still have issues.
---
good god I forgot there's a speakeasy at Big Al's... thanks for your help, this was driving me nuts.
---
Time for tping the Grafton mayor office, whitesprings and throwing rotten eggs at sbq
---
Read the notes around the church.
---
yea thats known as the nukashine just remember its the machine
---
I thought that shots down the sights always landed right on the dot but you had to compensate for weapon sway. Are you saying that aiming down Iron sights or scoped aiming has a cone of fire? I thought only hip-fire had a cone.
---
I remember hearing about some players having their bans lifted after that first wave, but then being banned again almost immediately what seemed like for no reason or they didn't want to lift bans in the first place, but I'm not sure what that was about.
---
Maybe it's not that they don't do anything, they just seem kinda slow I guess. The damage was done and *then* action was taken.
---
I much prefer it be a limited time event item, gives it some oomf as a collectable, like the fasnacht masks.
---
For it to be useful, it needs to do more damage than a missile launcher, but then missile launchers would need a durability nerf to balance them, then we'd be repairing them each shot.... It's a balance issue. But, hey, it's still just an old musket. Novelty.
---
I picked them up but don't remember their names. what did I miss?
---
Alright, thanks for the info
---
If they are key cards save them. If they are silo codes don't worry about it. The self destruct every week.
---
I pick them up to stop the beeping.
---
Oh, alright. I’ll just give them away or something.
---
Not trying to sound like a dick but I do pretty well without all these things tbh...could win a match single handed with a .45 combat rifle alone and good positioning. Bushes and all. Don’t even use power armor. Not even exaggerating. perks I run are master shotgunner, master commando, Ghoulish, tenderizer, adrenaline, frog legs and bloody mess, and it’s a great challenge. Still die a lot, and win overseer quite a bit. Also played a round (just one, but it was pretty cool reaching a stalemate for once) that has ended in a tie, it’s not impossible. 
---
Just sayin if they add whatever you said to the mode it would only make things way easier for people like me.
---
No clue
---
Once you know which random encounter points to check, you can find a sheepsquatch in 3 hops easy. If I could find 3* legendaries that way it's the only thing I would do. The mappalachia project and a few other groups have datamined the entire map for all possible locations.
---
Survival Rejects, ha!
---
Visited a camp that looked pretty hospitable until I noticed that all their vendor machines were inside a lvl 3 locked room. This looked like the attempt of a "survival reject" who wanted to initiate pvp. I had marsupial on, and the backdoor was open, so I went inside there to the vendor without becoming "wanted."
---
Got what I wanted, and right when I left, I saw a much lower player show up, and I guess he picked the lock. We both showed up to the Prime event and there he was with the "wanted" stigma, so I jumped on area chat and asked if he wanted me to get rid of it. He gave me the thumbs up, so I took off Pacifist mode, and told him I was gonna go ahead and kill him, but I'll protect his loot. He immediately came back, and he was no longer wanted, and he got his loot back. He gave me the thumbs up, and I wished him well and to watch out for shady camps like that.
---
Sometimes Walmart is $15 for console.
---
Dont worry about it. The silo codes dont weigh anything and just disappear from inventory.
---
If they are key cards put them in your vendor for some caps. Those don't expire and someone who does launch will buy them. Ez caps.
---
Hold down the aim down sight button as you reload and it will reload a bit faster.
---
You'll get all level one from the purveyor. If you want lvl 5, level to 5, then you will get 5 and 1.
---
Yep, you're right. Youtube was the one place I didn't look, but I searched for it there and immediately found a video lol.
---
Latest Inside-the-Vault mentions a "mischief-filled new Seasonal Event" ;)
---
You wouldn’t know if a player was in the foliage. That’s why I tend to shoot every bush I come across. Have gotten a decent amount of surprise kills just by doing so. 
---
If you know people hide in bushes, and you can’t normally see them...just shoot the bushes. Lol 
---
And ammo never is a problem for me. Just pick em up off of dead bodies. I end almost every round with a fuck ton of ammo. Could just keep firing for the duration of the entire last circle and still have hundreds left over.
---
Did you read the Terminal?
---
No it isn’t
---
I'd level the playing field because my adventure mode character can't use endurance    and charisma and luck perk cards I'd be be able to use them without having to grind to allocate points to them. And really would it really make it easier for you the storm NEVER stops moving so you've failed in your attempt not to sound like a dick you're either hacking or you never ever stop playing.
---
I like how you said that last bit. Playing with the same bastards almost every night you start to compile a hit list of enemies and rivals. Lmao it is absolutely amazing. Players I’ve come across have come to know my name for sure.
---
In player venders obviously, aside from that no.
---
Some say Haven Church is legitimately haunted.  Others say it's an automated pipe organ still churning away after all these years.  Either way, it reliably plays creepy music in the middle of the night.
---
Just because it isn't impossible doesn't it mean it's likely to ever happen in a game I play what ever"squad stream" will always win no matter what I do. These changes are to bring everyone on the same level to make the game mode more fun for skill less idiots like me that spend most fights trying to select what they want to use with their weapon wheel.
---
And I did say that those perks would be removed which you would know if you read the whole thing.
---
Fucked up my adventure character just cause I didn’t wanna start a new one for NW. Actually on vacation right now, don’t know how else to say it but reality is I’m pretty good. Terrible at other games except battlefield really. And if the storm never stopped moving then yeah, easier to catch people running from it. 
---
Hate to say it but some folks out there really chalk it up to “hacking” when reality is people could just be really good. You could put yourself in the lobby and ask randoms if they have heard of my gamer tag and they’ll tell you I’m a pain in the ass. 
---
Add me on PS4 if you’re on it, catch a game and get back to me. I’ll send you my psn. I would even be down to run a game with you and show you what I mean. No hacks or cheats. I’ll even run the standard perk load out and churn out as many wins as I can.
---
Yup. Hence the standard load out. Lol
---
Mutants is only 10% dmg boost where two shot is 25% and it multiplies with explosive. You are spouting off nonsense. Mutants is scrip, even explosive mutants.
---
Go to westek, murder everything. 
---
Go to the satellite above westek, murder everything.
---
Go to huntersville, murder everything.
---
If the legendary count was 5 or more, stay in server and hit the steakhouse and harpers ferry in a constant loop.
---
If not then just server hop.
---
You are now a ghoul
---
What do you mean what " standard" load out there shouldn't be any perk cards that are better than others they should all be the same.
---
It is a stupid barrier that prevents you from playing more. Since this is the only end game loop, why not just remove the daily cap and allow us to play as long as we want?
---
Hey you run what you prefer.  The only way TSE is good is if you play in enemies faces. I’ll run a better gun than TSE in any and all of my characters. TSE is mediocre at best, and WAY overvalued.  
---
Did you spend 20K on yours?
---
Fuck this posting here is a waste of my time this mode will still always be a hodgepodge of pro gamers and "squad streamers" that I'll have to suffer through until I reach level 100 in a 100 years.
---
[removed]
---
It doesn't help, that is outdated. Tenderizer has been broken since then.
---
There was a bug on PC a few months ago where any acid damage at all would crash the game, guess the Orkin man wasn't very thorough.
---
Uhh.. Both shots land in the same spot when you aim down sights, and if you are hip firing you aren't trying to be accurate anyway. And Tse procs explosive twice to give +75% damage compared to a pitiful +35% on a mutants explosive. You don't know anything about the damage calculations or weapon handling if you think mutants isn't absolute trash.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cqvxb4/updated_comparison_of_legendary_weapon_mods/
---
As you can see, mutants is bottom of the barrel garbage.
---
Yeah or just have them in the loot table.
---
Alright thanks, I just wanted to make sure
---
Drunk junky?
---
Yup, I just had my executioner death claw and had to try and keep her spinning while I hid behind her hitting. Any time I got in front was instant death
---
Soon
---
Sometime in November.
---
Also, all the custom animations work with a human opponent. They would have to create entirely new animations for all that. And since fallout 76 is basically just fallout 4 assets (I love this game tho &lt;3) it wasnt happening. Not on zenimax's cheap ass budget
---
I have a TSE dragon and adrenal reaction, nerd rage, solar powered and radicool. All together when I have a bunch of rads it’s day time and I have low health it does over 1200 damage so that’s pretty good noting that I don’t have the rifle perks
---
They were, but the regular options aren't, as far as I know. Limb damage is also a common roll on melee weapons, I think.
---
I already have drunk lawman. I was talking more of perks and junk/scrap look. Cobbled together sort vibe.
---
Survival was the best!
---
It was removed due to bug, there was an issue with melee weapons having 2 fixed attributes. 2nd slot was 50% limb damage and slot 3 was either weightless or +1 agility. They have implemented a 25% overall discount to compensate for it
---
Dude, you seem to be taking this personally.  
---
Go try a good gun.  If you’re in to Levers, get an IE or BE. Then tell me how your TSE Lever compares. TS is a crap prefix. There are much less expensive prefixes that are way better. Just use the lever example and compare TS to Instigating.  Instigating is WAAAY better.  I like being able to 1-shot level 68 3* Supermutants with a single bullet when I use a lever. 
---
And yes I understand how exploding works.
---
Yeah, if you're on PS4 I think I have a few left as well.
---
I mean, if you wanna trash talk on two-shot, at least know what you are talking about. It's not like either of them are good compared to BE
---
Then same thing was happening to me before i realised it. It will break down single items like the bug parts before it breaks down your bulk acid.
---
Ah ... ok
---
So, one of my characters is a bloody rifleman. I intentionally don’t use matching armor, never wear an outfit and am using railways. The aesthetic is junky, mis-matched and kinda cool. 
---
Railway is both effective and nice and asymmetric looking. I use a flight helmet, and I think I have a metal chest, trapper arm, combat one leg, robot other arm, etc. Looks nice and mismatched. Unyielding / Sentinel - and since you’re trying to shoot more than melee you really don’t have to have the highest DR / ER - most of your defense is blocker, fireproof, serendipity, etc.
---
I enjoy that look.
---
You have 12.5 days
---
By the time you start finding them, you already have a fully modded 3 star legendary powerful automatic silenced combat rifle, maybe a Fixer. 
---
However, damage is not pathetic. Radium rifle is great. I happen to have an Antiarmor one (3 stars, don't remember the other two) but I cant use it because I havent learned any mods yet. 
---
The problem, in my opinion, is ammo. It uses ammo that can be better spent on a lever or combat rifle. If it fired .38, lots of people would try it and adopt it.
---
I spent all my scrip on the mystery pick... :(
---
I'm giving away my caps for nothing.  Luck isn't required.  If I can't get a formal competition then I guess I randomly do my eccentric generosity.
---
Ok I won't.
---
Love the story :) !
---
Liberty prime? He look all American?
---
Good news! You at least foresaw your disappointment because it's not in the atom shop anymore.
---
But yea
---
Lol. I was hoping would be part of the tricentenial pack I did not purchase because I wasn't 100% sure.
---
why would anyone downvote you for asking that? i did the samething
---
Lol. I was hoping tricentennial.
---
 You are  entered.  Someone will message you in a few days to book.
---
I have a 2 * version with out the reload speed that i gave 10k for.  One of my teammates has one and when perked out right, you can watch the SBQ's health bar drop. Takes about 2 min and 750 rounds each and she is toast.
---
You are correct. My most entertaining characters are those who choose their armor and weapons based on style. My survivalist gunslinger knows there are better weapons than his quad western revolver and his multipurpose axe, but boy... he loves them as much as he loves his green rag hat and his Cappy shirt and jeans.
---
What level are you? I imagine that the amount  required increase as you gain level is that the same for every level how am I supposed to know.?
---
There are new challenges given daily and once a week. But there are also a bunch of fixed challenges. Maybe you haven't noticed it yet but there is an item in the in-game menu that you can select and review them all.
---
If you still have it I'd be interested.
---
I started a pistol/shotgun build on a new character and am hunting for weapons to use down the road..
---
I know neither of those weapons (pistol/shotgun) are great end game but it sounded fun, he may never leave the forest.
---
theres 3 sets, when u do standard/expert it rolls for 1 set and then give a plan you dont have. if it rolls for the set u have completed, u get nothing or maybe some other plan not related to the vault.
---
Ha
---
Ty
---
Wow.  Ok this is good.
---
Ty been looking for somthing to replace my 3* medic pistol that does explosive damage.
---
Ohhh. Thanks.
---
Oddly, the scorchbeast &amp; queen's strafe attacks both use the same exact effect for poison damage, but the strafe attack causes the very same type of lockups (stuck on a frame for seconds or minutes) as the strangler armor, but it does so when it turns creatures into their scorched variants, not when it damages them with poison.
---
Name one thing in the game that would be more entertaining than watching hundreds of mines spew out of the ground like a snake.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo
---
No but supposedly you can get them from purveyor
---
It's fine to have a personal preference against the downsides of two-shot, they break faster, they are bad in vats, and have less hip-fire accuracy. But mutants is outclassed by literally every single other legendary effect except assassins. You could be using a non-legendary lever action and still get one shot kills in adventure mode.
---
Only if you have the plans learned can you potentially get legendary from her
---
That's what pacifist is for
---
4 perks
---
I specifically said, "from a gameplay standpoint" &amp; "other than the folklore stuff."
---
As far as I can tell, it’s a straight upgrade from the Combat Rifle—there’s nothing that the Combat Rifle does better. The Fixer even weighs less. So I’d assume it would appeal to fans of the Combat Rifle at the very least
---
Also, that isn't even the fallout wiki. Which I have already been to.
---
Nope, he's still banned. And it was 100k Ultracite ammo. Serves him right, it is obviously an exploit to craft a surplus of the strongest ammo early in your game career.  
---
Also, it was actually only 20k ultracite ammo that he happened to pick up 5 times while transfering it between his main and his mules while trying different weapons.
---
Berserkers? Nocturnal?  Stalkers? Exterminators? Etc. Mutants isn’t bad at all.  I’d rather have a flat out 10% damage boost than any of those.  
---
And no a non-legendary lever won’t 1-shot 3* Level 68 Supermutants.  You pretty much need Instigating or Bloodied for that.
---
Ok, I was just trying to help on the “real” wendigo. 👍
---
I get that.
---
Im more so looking for opinions, could it be that the "Wendigos" in 76 are just another name for the "Trog" mutation we saw in The Pitt? What do you think?
---
Yea its called pacifist mode
---
Do you have a link I cant find your previous post?  I will be remodling mine when i move my current one is nice maybe not winner but be nice to enter.
---
Nah I already know about the real wendigo. I played Until Dawn lol.
---
Yeah, but do you really need that extra sneak?  I sure don’t.  I just don’t see how a BE Fixer is better than a BE Handmade.  I’m not saying the fixer sucks, I just don’t see why people are offering crazy caps for it.
---
No, you can only craft legendary armor
---
Right on. 👍
---
I honestly don’t remember them.  I haven’t played FO4 in 2+ years and I just don’t recall.
---
Why?  I did the other day at work, and my co-worker told me he was still grinding for an extremely rare rune in Diabolo 2.  But, that's just our "normal" conversations.
---
Now, if I did that at the bar, then I'd get some weird looks.  And probably get a tin foil hat wearing "modern day adventurer" to tell me "not to cross those suns-abitches".
---
It is though.  It's just more rare to find a bloodied explosive dragon than a handmade.  And the handmade doesn't break after 5 shots.  And most of your farming is going to involve killing lots of enemies, preferably in fast succession.  You can totally one shot scorchbeasts with a good dragon though.
---
Yeah, so it’s worth a lot because of that, and because of the reasons you stated in your OP
---
On this note I'm convinced sloths came from oblivion trolls, and scortchbeasts are skyrim dragons
---
I picked up a good fixer today, so I’ll try it out tomorrow.  Just looking at the numbers after modifying it, I was disappointed.
---
man you talk about ppl crying, and been fucking moron, and not contributing anything to the post, but look at yourself, crying/been a dumb fuck and bringing nothing to the post. 
---
about games. then you would know that PC are better for everything compared to consoles.
---
i was just saying that you are a fucking hypocrate.
---
at a nuked whitesprings last night a guy was able to pool all the glowies to their knees.  we had a easy fish in the barrel.  just 7 dudes respecting the tag first game and prospering.  good hunting yall
---
I just keep putting 5.56 in my vending machine....
---
They're from The Pitt DLC, they're basically very fast feral ghouls that run on 4 legs and look like the wendigos.
---
Its works for me on ps4 but i cant get some other ones to work in the mire region the cloe one and talk to boomer one.
---
I do that all the time with one of my heavy guns.  I’ll pull the whole clubhouse and kill 20+ ghouls at once. 
---
I’ll test my fixer tomorrow.  I was just super disappointed after modifying it and looking at the damage numbers compared to my Handmade.
---
Huh? Those are 2 different universes. You don't think the same mutation could happen more than once in another area of the US? All im asking for is the real difference between them.
---
It took me 40 minutes to run far enough away (over-encombered), to realize I was sorta safe.  Until I heard the second one.  I ran across three of them on my, what seemed like a forever, journey to find a damn vendor that wasn't out of caps!  I don't even look for them when I hear them.  I just keep moving.  Eventually, I will take one one when I'm not bogged down in junk!
---
SHMAGMYER my camps nothing special but it's pretty essential for any dweller to stop by :)
---
I’m not even sure if I played that.  I had a season pass, so I assume I got it, but I don’t remember it. 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh wIt, you’re talking FO3!  That’s why I don’t remember it. 🤦‍♂️
---
Is there any confirmation that the wendigos in 76 aren't just sufferers of a disease like the trogs? Is there origin ever explained besides myths and legends?
---
Honestly I only have a few complaints about the camps: the inability to have stairs right next to a wall, the build limit, the no inward corner pieces for the roof, and how when you have an inward corner there's a gap in the wall.
---
A banned player just buys another dirt cheap copy of the game and returns with less to lose and more to prove. When they're tired of doing that, they no longer care about keeping their methods to themselves, and release them to others.
---
I didnt watch but Bethesda made shit break faster with this last patch
---
I hate anything with the Two Shot prefix, but this is a valuable weapon.  If you’re smart, you’d trade this for a Vampires, Anti Armor, or better prefix.  TSE weapons are extremely overvalued, so I’d try to flip this into a much better gun.
---
Probably the best DLC from 3 in my opinion. Trogs are also in New Vegas in the plant vault, but they're all green and are called "Spore Carriers."
---
Think of it as a Christmas present.
---
Switch servers
---
I’ll hold my head in shame...I barely played FO3.  I only got into the series with 4.
---
What are you talking about? The fixer outdamages the handmade. It's the new top tier rifle with the highest damage per shot. https://youtu.be/-xUqpKkB0bU
---
Fixer base damage: 98
---
Handmade base damage: 92
---
You should really give them a try dude, 3 and NV are by far my favorites of the series. You just gotta get over the bad graphics and glitchyness haha.
---
thanks
---
I don’t have an account to post pictures here, but I have a BE Handmade and BE Fixer, and the Handmade still does better damage with the same mods.  Maybe I have to use different mods on the fixer?
---
The handmade in the video is 6 damage less than the fixer with the same mods. 98 to 92
---
I only started during the free trial this past summer so, I never experienced the very worst I guess.
---
I might.  👍
---
The solution, make plans for enclave and BoS paintjobs. Just like the pionere scout Bowie knife is set up :)
---
West Coast Fallout is the best Fallout. New Vegas is the actual best game of all time.
---
I’ll double check tomorrow.  I’m using it semi-auto as I’m a rifleman build, so maybe that’s part of it.
---
Definatly
---
Their is two quests that focus on the orgins of the wendigo one is of a human supposedly turning into one and another is the one hinting at it being a cryptid or possibly mythical creature.
---
Their both pretty interesting to complete
---
So is it true to the myth? Do those people eat another human to turn into one? Or is it a mutation?
---
It's the ginchiest!
---
i would think becuase its kind off a 4 star if you think about it, it comes already with a modifier and now you can get it from Moma with other 3 modefiers.
---
im not a shotgun build so I dont have any use for it.
---
edit: combat rifle not shotgun.
---

---
That's the build I running. But it's a bloodied sniper build. 
---
I don't know if it's any good, but it works for me.
---
When I first saw Bethesda's ver of Paul Bunyan and His Pal, Babe The Blue Ox.  I thought that when you'd click on it, a big Nuka-Cola Cap would fall into a slot in it's base &amp; both Paul &amp; Babe would animate.  I hope Bethesda's F76 team makes something like a 3 pak incl a tweak to Paul &amp; Babe, approx high of player, for your idea of : "Tip yer Cap(s) to the CAMP owner !" animating "Kudo Banks".  Well, for me, the animation was "uninspired" ; Don't-cha all feel it needed some wood chopping ?  Maybe the halves land on Babe's horns then 2 big proud smiles, eh !? 🛶🪓🛷🥍🏒 🍁🔅   Onto the ideas of others.  I've got more, but datz e-nuff 4 now.
---
🍁🔅 Yep, I'm a Crazy Canuck ( *It's* 🐱‍🏍*stereotyper !*..🤪) ; BTW, Paul is also my Dad's name, he moved from Québec on own before the age of 16, and worked from coast to coast here.  This included as a lumberjack &amp; as a job most would not do, log-hopping on lakes &amp; rivers, pole-hook in hand, clearing log jams.  He worked a couple short stints in the Good Ole USofA.  He's &gt;85 now, his lumberjack &amp; mining (etc) years are gladly long behind him.
---
I heard Papa often say the CURSE WORD (++) in the next part...
---
The Bunyan name is born from the laughter-inducing curse-word "Bonne'yenne !" ( bonne-rienne )  ( aka "bonne-a-rienne🔆", said aloud by Acadian &amp; Québecker lumberjacks. 🔆The 'r' in rienne basically rendered silent to mask the cussing + feminization of the thing / issue cursed over.  It would be like the co-worker saying : "Diss axe, she's good fer nutting !"...except worse.

shit you are totaly right. good looking out.
---
That’s a nice 50. Congrats.
---
That's honestly the hard part the quests has notes saying this guy starts to turn feral and then awendigo attacks you. Which never really clarifys if the wendigo is the dude or just a wendigo.
---
The other quest I can't remember.
---
My opinion wendigos are just seriously mutated and feral humans that where possibly evolved from another factor, like the FEV or maybe the scorched virus.
---
I wish I knew because things like this are why I used to revisit the same places looking for new information
---
Try the white spring bunker
---
I live here. Some people dont know it's a separate state. Eventhough weve been here since 1863🙄🤷‍♀️
---
In short, you use perks that don't work in PA while wearing PA, and you believe that your acid damage ignores all resistances, because you're unaware that it is reduced by poison resistance.
---
They remind me a lot of the Trogs so I decided to make this post, plus they're seen with Feral Ghouls a lot of the time which makes me think they're like the Trogs.
---
see it all go boom!!!!! and after that the server crashing. lol
---
In the nukashine
---
here here!
---
Because I am pretty sure the trogs aren't aggressive towards feral ghouls in Fallout 3, but I could be wrong.
---
Yeah, same with alot of discovery quests
---
Pretty sure i got that by mistake. Took a break and hopped on piano so it wouldn't time me out.
---
All four of them need a buff imo, and the blunderbuss just needs to be recorded because it's just a big heavy pistol that shoots one shot. It should be a shotgun
---
I tend to do best with legendaries when I decide to roam a road for a couple hours.
---
Theoretically it could be possible that the throgs are a evolved or devolved wnedigo considering FO3 takes place over s century later or longer and  during the history of fallout monsters where known to migrate like deathclaws and werid snake dogs from big MT, cazadors and others of similar nature.
---
Edit you could ask In the fallout lore Reddit where they tend to provide more accurate and concisee information in regards to questions like this.
---
Have you tried going up to the terminal?
---
The only one to keep an eye out for are the nuke cards you get after shooting down those vertibot helicopters. The little one will drop a crate with the card in it.   Even if someone else shoots it down, you have 5 minutes to grab one (and some other loot).
---
Undamaged ashtrays, cigarettes and flip lighters galore...
---
Yeah I think they might be related somehow I like that
---
yeah he said it was from a perk that cripples them. I derp on the name. good hunting bro
---
oh thank you
---
thank you
---
I see a lot of builds in general doing bloodied. Heard they are super powerful. I will have to look into it. I'm just not sure I want to run around with low health lol
---
As long as you have some serious firepower it’s very doable and fun.  I’m sure any decent commando build could do it. That said, heavy builds would be the best for sheer destruction (and wasting tons of bullets).
---
Howd you get armor to show while you have grognack armor.

What exactly do you need to know how to do while wielding a plasma gatling in power armor?

Having to stand still for chameleon to activate is a 100% movement speed decrease.
---
I try’d it allot but never got 4 hits /. And the repeating radio call get annoying / maybe now there is no survival it might start getting filled
---
as a bloodied melee I find it fun as hell but I'm not speced for making ammo.
---
My first time was when I was in a party. The guy said there was Sheepsquatch near him and I thought he was pulling my leg. Funny enough there he was in Berkeley. I didn’t know it was so tough.
---
dang
---
So have Hunter/Hunted (PVP) right below Pacifist Mode on the Settings tab?
---
Nothing big. They broke the game and fixed it and then broke it again and then they fixed it again. Oh we also got raids that we have to finish within given time, which makes it undoable cause servers are shitty and we have to wait for like a whole minute for a stupid door to open
---
I went into one of the groves in the cranberry big looking for a megasloth  found a sheepsquatch killed it and the mole miners around tried to find a megasloth left the big not five minutes later found another sheepsquatch killed it and then five minutes later a level 91 Deathclaw

---
You can pull the whole clubhouse to the door playing melee?  I’ll have to try this once I level up my melee character during the next double experience weekend.  I’ll be bloodied, so maybe it won’t work for me. 🤔🤷‍♂️
---
If you wanted to set it up like that, sure. Or just still let it exist as a radio station that you can swap over to via pip boy. 
---
Maybe give it like a 15 minute cd from when you last fought another player so that players couldn’t swap over mid fight.
---
Yeah I agree 👍
---
I'm pretty sure it's just that noone is taking this challenge literally. I'm pretty sure it says enemies that have become scorched. Well creatures can actually become scorched after they spawn. Idk how I think just any scorched attacking it can pass the disease but I'm pretty sure they have to turn to register.

That typically does not crash the server, but it will often cause the client to become unresponsive until it catches up, depending on the machine. When Windows says a program is not responding, it does not mean it has crashed. Hence the option to wait that it gives you.
---
1. Display cases for guns, magazines, bobbleheads and misc. junk
---
2. Vault raids
---
3. Public events are a bit different now
---
4. Laser weapons got a buff
---
5. Survival mode has been cut
---
6. You can now build a 20 lb backpack if you dont want to do the Tadpole challenges
---
how do you do no. 6?
---
Honestly comes down to the server. I've had a horde of ghouls attack me along the road near the golf course at white spring with three if five being legendary. 
---
Other times I've seen none in a session.  
---
I always seem to run into more when grouped up with my friends though that's for sure.
---
So that you can hog up all them sweet legendaries by yourself
---
Idk what Im looking at
---
It would be great if Bethesda gave the PA users some decent Legendary armor to grind for, I know the raids give legendary armor but to be quite frank it looks ridiculous, I was thinking more along the lines of chameleon and such like not something that looks like an exploding bush.
---
Agree
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
This pic makes my vampire's tesla spark with joy. :-)
---
It was 2 + 2 + 1.  The 1 was a sucky revolver, but at least it will nicely fit in my stash before I grind it.
---
If you're offering I would love one for me and one for my friend! I have the skeleton one and am rocking it right now but the witch is calling my name! I'm willing to buy or provide mats or whatever.
---
If you have shotgun, and have the Enforcer perk, shooting them in the legs can make them fall down. And by "them" I mean pretty much everything. Sheepsquatchs, Mirelurk Queens, Deathclaws. Enforcer has a pretty good knockdown and cripple chance, and combat shotguns (with drum) can carry a lot of rounds. A lot of things turn from threats into mostly harmless when their legs are gone.
---
Note that Legendary creatures, if they get to do the Mutate thing, that can and will heal their legs and so they'll be able to get up again. And they can and will then eat your face if you didn't get out the shotgun to shoot their legs out again.
---
I ran a shotgun as my alternate weapon as soon as I got Enforcer. I only stopped using it when I got my hands on a bloodied explosive .50 cal since that just eats things.
---
I’m saying it’s unfair how they’ve now changed it to 25% of the boxes instead, when I’ve spent my scrip.
---
*EDIT :* About the AT☢MS.  Even if Bethesda would create objects for this BUT entering them ( gift for friendly likable beginner and / or kudo's for a very fun thoughtful CAMP would be at -25%, it would be ok by me.
---
So if you want to gift the CAMP 100 AT☢MS, it'll cost you 125 AT☢MS.  I would not mind it were it to happen.
---
I was at that person's CAMP located behind the hanging Radscorpion ( the pond ).  It was sometime soon before or right after the last "Meat Cook".
---
A player 3 to 4 x's my level ( I'm L38 ) took a photo of us as my Gifting emojimation and the CAMP owner's "I Heart" emojimation was going.
---
The CAMP owner was wearing dirty T-shirt &amp; jeans.  After I advised the player of what I would do &amp; that he needed to stay close to me at the back corner indoors where some small gas generators where, I dropped some gifts of armor, guns, etc. ( nothing major, but I wanted to help and the person was 😊) and there was no issue with a snatch &amp; run.🙂
---
Whitesprings.  I just got a blooded 3* goss rifle
---
Black powder weapons are kinda pointless when you can one shot almost anything with any weapon with the right build. Maybe when they add hard mode into this game and a freaking ghoul has like 10k hp, they might become usable
---
I've seen this happen when someone is over the absolute carry weight limit and they drop a minr and it duplicates when it hits the ground and makes weird stacks, people used to do it with bottlecap mines before they got removed
---
Do you sell them for 10 each? If so what's your Xbox gt I'll buy a bunch for that price
---
Thats the issue, BP weapons should be at the top for having one bullet in them. I'd even settle for super far range.
---
What do you mean unobtainable? What's it called?
---
I mean they do big amount of damage, but you don't need that much to one shot a super mutant warlord. When it comes to bosses with a lot of hit points, you still need like multiple shots and since dps isn't that high on black powder weapons, you're screwed.
---
you're about 3 weeks late...  and wrong, they already addressed this, they're not going anywhere
---
There is perks in strength to lower ballistic ammo and drugs weights. I carry like 100 stims and 10 k ammo (5mm)
---
Grafton day is too short of a event. I love uranium fever as it not only gives legendaries but a good supply of black tittanium.
---
Ok so this is my build roughly. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334e6b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sg2pe2e00s12ip2id2lu2lt2ls2l71ep1ic4sb2s72au2c52cr0&amp;w=&amp;m=c9egh&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
I can usually carry 100 radaway and 100 stimpacks along with whatever random other chems I pick up (i sell random chems to vendors for 1400 caps each day)
---
As for food and drink. I just make around 10 soup at a time and that's all I usually eat. But I do usually have 50+ water and non perishable food on me at all times.
---
I probably don't need the food/drink perk but I just collect so much as I'm a hoarder and don't like to leave things behind. You can all ways just eat and drink stuff that you come across and never pick up food or drinks that you won't use on the spot.
---
Having weapons weight reduction armor pieces.  With 5x you get 90% weapon weight reduction which allows you to carry a ton of other stuff. I also have a back pack with deep pocketed armor and a high capacity backpack if I get stuck somewhere.
---
There's always a plan for one in the Overseer's cache inside Morgantown's Airport.
---
Sure, make it even harder to get a hit on the legendary. That will fix it.
---
U wanna get rid of anything how about the pricket fort event to burrie the corpse so that blasted mayor will shut up.
---
I prefer Uranium Fever, but I don’t think it works as a Public Event because of the limited space.  With modifications, Grafton Day could become a good Public Event because there’s lots of space.
---
Join a player faction and run queens with them. 
---
I’m in wasteland republic and they prob do like 9 queen runs per day. All you do is wait for a call out and they will run all three silos. I have way to many legendary weapons since joining them I hit my scrip daily max so fast. 
---
Here’s a invite like to the discord- Xbox one only. 
---
https://discord.gg/9aDRTur
---
Yes it's fixed, you can complete the musician badge now
---
I just pretend the event takes place in the rest of the mine. I go clear out the other wing instead of the event area since I know I'm never going to get a tag in on a legendary with 15 people crammed in there so why bother trying anymore. I still get the event reward from out there which is at least something.
---
Fair enough. I feel your pain. However, I hope we get the 50% off from the purveyor later
---
platform would help
---
I don't carry much consumables. Found out you can just eat what you find on the ground and still have some left for later eats. I don't carry much ammo either. I leave my camp with like 120 .45s and 100 5.56s and that's it. Kinda keeps the game a bit more interesting. Can't afford to miss a shot
---
True my fault XB1
---
Yeah i just build an extra foundation piece, jimmy the wall the way you want it,  then bam delete the extra.  Its need using the brick and covering the white with purchased wooden wall paper
---
Lol meant duper auto'd to super. I loaded in ws and thought I saw like the building blowing up as it does sometimes when you load to a camp. Nope, was a dude standing on the side shooting mines out like he ate bad sushi.
---
no worries, PC otherwise I would
---
The dragon actually has very very good range, it's just really hard to aim on its ironsights
---
That’s a bug
---
You can get undamaged abraxo at whitesprings. If you go in from the station &amp; follow the path past the chalets, it’ll be near a little red car with some other cleaning supplies.
---
I saw a guy right over it though and it wasnt a graphic bug you could pick these up.
---
Wtf man. I'm starting to think Bethesda employees are involved in all these duping. They intentionally allow duping and make some extra cash off of it. There's no other explanation I mean how the fuck do they allow this to keep happening? No way an AAA game developers are this incompetent
---
I'd be happy with that.
---
for bloodied builds, for this gun instigating vats accuracy perception is a god roll
---
Maybe it was coincidence, but it looks awfully suspicious.
---
Not just with mines. Legendary Fixers are being duped to oblivion and they been out for like a month now? That means actual duping is happening right now
---
There are a few posts about this.
---
I finished the challenge with an Angler.
---
Correct
---
It’s oooold
---
Whenever you fast travel or load a zone, mines rain down on you
---
I had it happen a few times coming out of the big bend tunnel
---
Only like 10 or so, but it was pretty inconsistent
---
Couldn’t tell you what triggers it though
---
(Kinda similar to the scorchbeast corpse stalking you and falling in when you fast travel)
---
It's not their fault people are turds and keep finding loopholes if that is indeed the case. Megasloth may be right, maybe it was a bug. I just wanted to bring attention to it.
---
Sounds like one of the minor modifiers is 250DR while reloading ( which is bugged ). So that might be the problem.
---
Is the first shot decent and then does it drop off ( damage ) when you reload?
---
The Fixer is a good rifle but it's the legendary Fixers people want, a 3 star Fixer is a weapon with 5 legendary effects
---
A little.
---
Bummer thanks anyways!
---
Let me ask you this though. The pile had different nuke mines and meat cleavers in it. I also found a bag where the guy was standing with those items in it. So does that fit the bug you talked about or should I report this?
---
I carry two guns. 5k ammo. 100+ Water, 300+ stims. Cooked meat. When I leave camp I'm about 150 of 350.
---
Yeah he's still here on reddit bragging about being a duper and "giving away" items at his camp by selling them for dirt cheap. He has a camp with tens of thousands of junk items priced for 1 cap so he can feel good about duping because he's "sharing the wealth". He's an asshole.
---
All u need is Carnivore mutation so u can eat any meat,10stimpaks,10radaways,couple of radshields,some drinks,2 Guns and couple of thousand bullets.
---
I wonder if there is anywhere to find this information for yourself; quicker and with more accuracy?
---
West Tec.
---
I ALLWAYS find 2 to 3 legendaries there
---
A guy yesterday said he had that happen when he fast traveled to someone's camp.
---
It IS their fault. Other games don't have loopholes and if people somehow figure it out, they are insta banned.
---
Noooooot at all, lol
---
Report that shit 😅
---
I really want a vampire's, +vat's accuracy, - vat's cost LMG to play around with. 
---
Personally I think heavy weapons should get a bit of a vats cost redux like automatic rifles but that is just me. I'd settle for a fully functioning weapon modding system that let me tweak the gun to my tastes, but I'll just keep wishing there.
---
Done
---
Yah before going to faction I went to west tech. I love queen runs better tho... hell they even have a camp with four beds you can rest in while they launch all three nukes!
---
Also repair kits drop from
---
Queen 
---
FYI they are American beds tho :( felt so dirty laying in them as a Canadian.
---
That’s very handy, thanks. I’m in the same position as the previous poster. 3/4 for the Tadpole quest but the challenges are a real grind.
---
Hmm interesting. Thanks!
---
And sometimes it would just disappear.
---
You know the one at twin lakes well he has a big brother that lives close by that is often a legendary
---
I’ve got a 3* Fixer.  How does it have 5 effects?  You get the sneak bonus, so that’s 4.   If I could get a Bloodied, Vampires, Exploding, Faster Fire Rate, 50% Vats Crit Fixer, I’d be super excited. 😜
---
Neither does armorer.
---
It would probably all be spread out
---
Havnt tried angler yet but everything else has failed for me with the exception of scorched and beast will definitely give anglers a try.
---
I've seen this too, I have to store the artillery and place it again to get the grenades.
---
There would need to be alot more creatures added to make it so high lvls benifit from it. And there is were the issue is as toxic valley is a low lvl area. Everything is a 1 shot kill for us.
---
I am looking for a decent raider group / I joined one that disbanded and another that recruits player from xb1 but hasnt done anything in a month 💀😩
---
True, except they took action immediately.
---
The Encryptid event takes place in the Ash Heap, so there is precedent for a difficult encounter in a relatively low level area.  It would have to be beefed up though.
---
You're supposed to start your war stories with 
---
So there I was *IN THE SHIT*
---
"...by American standards..."? What on Earth does that mean?
---
Every game has loopholes and they do instaban. Or at least I hope the punishment it harsh.
---
I saw your post, spent 750 scrips on the 25% discount range weapons and got all trash so know you're in good company.
---
[PC] Thank you so much. Dumb question what do the dead trick or treaters look like? Are they in costumes like in the American films (I'm English). I have never seen any corpses  dressed like that.
---
It doesnt seem to count with the scorched enemies, ive encounted this before, not sure if its a bug or intentional
---
In school we have a grading system based on letters and anything that's like 65% or lower is an F or Failing.
---
It's not a bug, it's a duping method triggered by dropping items while over the  absolute carry weight limit. It's an old method that only works on mines but now it works on meat cleavers too so steel and wood is now infinite. It started again with meat week and when those mine piles go off it can easily crash the server.
---
https://youtu.be/UxCDXZGTZXo
---
Fyi because of event update you keep your junk when you die at this event (or any event with a ! in the event marker on map, like sbq or uranium fever etc.)
---
i was just having fun with it, I know how computers work but thank you for the info anyways.
---
Trogs were caused by a virus.  The wendigos are descendents of the banished leader of the gourmands.
---
People are blatantly duping and crashing servers when those mine piles go off. https://youtu.be/UxCDXZGTZXo
---
I dread having to use PA because I go overencumbered as soon as I enter it! 2pcs FDC weight reduction, 2pcs ammo weight, 1 pc weapon weight, all armor +1 str, and 2 weapons are 90% reduced weight too
---
Ive found swapping weapons with the left d-pad works for me 100% of the time (swap to last weapon)
---
BUT this bug only occurs for me on my combat rifles when Im server hopping and it was my last weapon used (hence first one equipped when I load a new server). Its a pretty specific trigger but the fix I mentioned works always for me. Side note might be because I kit my combat rifles to .38 auto. Ive noticed it highlights in my inventory that its using .38 and .45 (that little ⬛ beside the ammo is on both??)
---
I see; blodied as a whole doesn't work so well in pvp anymore.  
---
Crouching in PA with Stealth Boy torso on hotkey is very doable though and quite effective (as no one really expects it).
---
Fix your servers. This is getting embarrassing.
---
Spending an hour to launch a nuke only to get DC’d right after is fucking irritating.
---
This is great... I have a fixer with anti armor, vats chance, and less vats cost.  Now it actually GAINS ap while I'm firing it.  It's ridiculous.  Now I need all my guns to have less vats cost...
---
I dunno why anyone expects this game to work a year later. Why the hell would it?

Good read.

I just spent almost an hour doing a solo nuke only to be DC’d immediately after I launched.

Nothing I like more than wasting my fucking time.

Are you on playstation?

Nov 2020
---
Sweeeeeet!
---
Oh
---
Yeah, it's real random which ones are registering. One random actual Scorched worked for me, but nothing else so far.
---
Tales of west Virginia hills portrays a wendinger as a sick old man that turns. Weather is a disease or mutation o have no clue
---
I was talking about recycled resources not lore lol
---
Nope. I'm on xbox and all my friends on xbox who use it experience the same thing.
---
I would but I'm hip deep in Borderlands 3 at the moment.  See you in about six months or so.
---
I mean, if you use sneak perks its guna hit like a truck regardless. Maybe people are just trying to use something other than 55.6 lol
---
Don't take things so literal. You are choosing to be willfully ignorant of what's actually being said here.
---
Its hilarious that you think those perks don't work in PA. You're factually wrong buddy.
---
This was great! If, I was your audience.
---
Thats fucked dude :/ They really need to design a system that Grant's you 10 atoms every time you disconnect.
---
And Chemist
---
I'm looking at the esm right now, and Serendipity clearly has a condition check for power armor.
---
Good job OP! I encouterd that summabitch when I was innocently herding some Brahmin back to their pen. At lvl 24 I was happy that someone over level 50 showed up and helped me down that monstrosity!
---
I was putting it as a joke :p but I really did that a lot, like a looooot (took me literally 2 weeks to craft a bloatfly syringe gun... &gt;_&lt;)
---
Right? Or at least the ability to re-join your last server.
---
I can confirm this has been a problem for a few months now
---
Nice build that's very similar to mine, only differences I have are that I focus more on Vats so I'm using level 1 gun fu and level 1 adrenaline to help clear hordes and I also run demolition expert 5 for a damage boost with my BE weapons and the option for grenades when things get hairy
---
Some YouTuber claimed via data one that the event is Halloween at The Whitesprings.
---
Never mind. Lmao. You got me, thanks for the info. I can admit when I've made a mistake. Now I have bloody mess instead.
---
Da heck? Is that true? I mean, crafting legendary =&gt; go to a workbench a craft a chameleon piece of armor ? Did I got it right? O_o
---
They have alot,camp fire tales,several in flatwoods,several in toxic valley,then once they grow a lil bigger then they got all of the mire.
---
they're really spread out so if someone sums it up that knows it already, that saves me a lot of time
---
So I always load at camp. That's just where I sign out from. So everyone it froze I'm watching my camp render in. I ran away this time and it instantly keeps going as normal. Gonna try again with both results couple more times to really see if this is a bug
---
Lol same gun I have, haven't been able to pick up a better one yet.  Realized the explosives damage is quite useful for it, best way to use INT points for additional damage it seems.
---
People have been duping steel too. But I heard the server crashes whenever these piles go off
---
It's not bugged
---
Thank you ! I like when people stick around and take photos and stuff. You would be surprised by the numbers of rude customers I get ! !   
---
But i'm sorry to tell you... but the picture aren't free, you owe me 15 caps... because i like monies !
---
They can't possibly sell for 500c each to a vendor?
---
It has been like that all along. This spooky thing isn't specifically related to Halloween.
---
Read down
---
It’s a different bug to what I was experiencing
---
How is that what they described?
---
Lolol no no just the armor from the raids, i dont know much about it because I dont do the raid. But it goes something along the lines of getting a plan for a reward, buying legendary modules from the purveyor, saving up vault steel, and then you can craft your armor you gota plan for.
---
So that’s what they were. I was playing last night and I took over monogah power plant for fusion cores and some prick lvl 200 (I’m lvl 60) came in blasting the fusion core generator and my defenses and he kept one shotting me with his explosive sniper that he had I was confused cause this was the first time I’ve had this happen since well actually first time ever cause usually I’ll encounter people who are nice and wave back but this fucker just kept killing me until he got bored fuck these blood hungry survival mode fucks
---
Idk what janky-ass servers you've been playing on but I've experienced maybe 10 total disconnects since game launch
---
I had nothing but just the ‘scorched’ and ‘scorchbeast’ count for me
---
Wow, that’s was nice at such a low level. I got my first near 100 and I had to hide in a shed and play peek a boo with it cause it allways ran away when I was in the shed too long. Man I was scared, still am today when I encounter one of high level in the open and no place to hide, lol.
---
No not until they either remove the timer or increase the time by triple or double. Getting nothing as a reward on novice is a waste of an hour for me
---
Honestly the best option would be to increase the rad damage drastically to make it a viable pvp weapon
---
Even the 10mm pistol can be viable!  I'm the only one who uses it above level 50 but damnit it's served me well.
---
I feel ya, and its constantly running so you waste time waiting for shit to just load.
---
Same here
---
You forgot to mention after the last time they fixed the game they managed to break it again so we are waiting for it to be fixed again
---
60% of the time it works every time.
---
I'm a bit worried about that too - I got an instigating pipe with very similar effects three times in a row and just stopped spinning.
---
Just did a vault raid yesterday and it was much improved. Loading times were faster and action/response times quicker too. Still not perfectly smooth but we had no major issues. It really seems to be dependent on how many people are doing the vault at any time and few people are interested right now.
---
Damn that's brutal usually I get to play for a little before I get kicked
---
You've got to remember there's like 250k people on this sub...and you will see 3 maybe 4 of these a day buddy...it only looks like you have no luck due to population and gloaters!
---
Hunters vats misdile launcher...it's the best drop yet!
---
When I found my hunters 50 cal I cried of joy. No more running. Jug down a hoppy hunter IPA just to save the time. Two at a time, no prob easy killings
---
The ones Bethesda puts me in. Lucky you ya might be close to where some of their servers are.
---
your in a PvP Zone. consider it the toll
---
You got elder?
---
I like this post a lot. Everyone whined and complained and we lost our survival server. So now gloves off
---
I tried like hell to build a Solo Sniper had an TSE Sniper and I missed all the the time, I had an AAE Sniper and it never did enough damage, then I went to instigating Sniper and my shots were not registering damage. The next problem is that the way the game renders AI that you still have to be relatively close enough to see them and a bit closer to actually have the game determine the hit marker. I don’t want to burst your bubble but from my experience of trying Sniper builds ‘it just doesn’t work.’ The game is flawed in design to benefit with fast shooting high damage guns (that’s why gatlings, handmades, 50cal, Tesla, Auto Lasers and LMGs are the rave) and it shows because things like Farman, missile launchers, revolvers and sniper rifles are all thrown away or scripted because they are slow and with the stupid AI high DR it doesn’t matter it’s one time damaged because it chance is all neglected by its armor.
---
&gt; Bethesda employees are involved in all these duping.
---
This. At this point it is pretty obvious.
---
Sure kids (or lifeless adults) can't imagine that these things happen, but for veterans like me, who have worked for decades in business and companies, it's a well known fact.
---
I don't get how they didn't stop the eBay Sellers with 50 copies in stock of the same god-roll weapon/armor. 
---
All they had to do is to make a purchase like if they were a normal customer and then, to track and to close the account/s involved. 
---
No legal measures, no talk with eBay (or with other similar sites), no bureaucreacy… just direct action! I would love all the problems I find in my work were so easy to solve!
---
You got good story telling skills! wall of text put me off first but i persisted!
---
Mursipial is a great mutations!, make sure to lock it down so that you don't lose when taking rad-away/decon shower.
---
Until the fixer shoots as fast as the handmade, or the server lags get corrected, this is true for the base damage, but that's about it...
---
A double tap with the handmade does twice the damage the first bullet does, because the second bullet also procs everything. Not possible with the fixer.
---
That's why you don't see any instigating handmades anymore, no one want to get rid of theirs.
---
Not a dumb question at all. Yes, that’s right, they’re dressed in the actual witch or skeleton costumes. There’s a vampire one also, although there isn’t a costume for that one, more’s the pity - I think he’s just advertising the Pumpkin House if I remember correctly. And I’m not surprised that you haven’t seen corpses dressed like that, as neither had I until I server hopped a good portion of my life away actively looking for them! I’m English too.
---
When exactly did they say that it was coming sooner?
---
can't wait for another Atom Shop limited time bundle exclusive outfit
---
Scrip
---
Are you saying instigating handmades can proc instigating twice because of server lag? Wouldn't lag let any gun do that if it were possible? I've never heard of double procs on instigating.
---
Yup
---
It looks better than it did originally.
---
She treated me good spent 50 scrip she handed me a Blooded Explosive combat rifle.
---
Xbox I’m afraid, but thanks for the offer! 👍
---
That's how mine does 2*2k headshots.
---
We've been running the Raid daily for over a month now, the servers have greatly improved. Dead in the water is also the shortest and least tedious of the 3 raids so if you were ever planning on running the raid now is the time. Novice and Standard can easily be completed, even if it would take each door litterally 5 minutes to open, which they don't (you can beat Standard with over 22:00 remaining on the clock).
---
Try avoiding US peak times for the smoothest experience.
---
PSN: scorchedwendigo
---
Pop by the south Whitespring station next time you are in the area
---
Novice takes less than 20 minutes though
---
Everyone I talk to on XB1 says it’s unplayable at normal or expert difficulty
---
I also think that is outdated. Since we see actual damage numbers, i think we also should see the damage difference thatd Tenderizer makes.
---
Yeah I forgot it was a pvp zone cause before they removed survival mode anyone I met there was friendly never once had I a problem with anyone in that zone even when defending it and accidentally shooting them friendly fire they wouldn’t retaliate but last night was different this guy was literally trolling me by destroying the fusion core generator and my generator and defenses he didn’t even take the workshop for himself just came in and killed me every chance he got lol I mean I’m not mad but after a while it can get annoying
---
I gotta test this out, I don't use instigating much because I'm a commando build.
---
Only half joking 🙃
---
Exactly, be smart about what you carry on you. Why is everybody else suggesting OP should make a food build smh
---
Hi there. So I have one each of X-01 Jet Pack and Optimized Servos. The Ultracite mods I am after are:
---
- Targetting HUD
---
- Core Assembly
---
- Kinetic servos
---
Happy to pay caps as well.
---
Don't respec, I also run as stealth commando for this.
---
15
---
Congratulations! 
---
I have to know.....what did the Sheepsquatch have for legendary loot? A good one star weapon can make a huge difference, especially when you’re starting out.
---
Some really good ideas here for PVP and PVE on the same server. The only thing I would suggest is that when "flagged" that you're in PVP mode, your gamertag colour changes to indicate it.
---
I've now been server hopping since I posted that question..... argh. :D I have the worst luck.
---
- I have seen many many death claws
---
- Some tents (lots of times)
---
- Scorched
---
- A grave (multiple times)
---
- Some bloke called Ford
---
- Some girl beginning with a K
---
..........I'm just grateful I know where to look now :)
---
OK i feel like I need one of these in my life, anyway to get them that isn't the atomic shop? :)
---
YES! I need to get in a boat in West Virginia, and fly to New Mexico!
---
How is weapon that has no dmg bonus compared to normal one absolute beast?
---
It's pretty set in stone that weel never have vehicles so long as Bethesda keeps running fallout on the same engine. Murders tried to make a train and it would crash the game everytime. They decided to scrap the idea and made the train a skin lmao
---
They are the only true good guys in fallout.
---
You guys carry so little while I carry so much lol. 62 cans of dog food, 33 corn soup, 33 grilled radstag, 398 stimpaks, 285 radaway, 105 rad diluted, 144 super stimpaks, all my weapons don't have weapon reduction except my combat knife and deathclaw gauntlet lol. Have a lever action, guass rifle, 10mm pistol, handmade, dragon. 340 carry weight out of 500 atm. Grilled radstag adds +20 carry weight and rad ant lager another +50 and +60 with high capacity backpack.
---
Aside from being nerfed into pea shooters, what’s wrong with shotguns?
---
Yes, absolutely, my PSN name is the same as my Reddit name. Send me a friend request and come and get a couple! Please be aware though that I switch between playing two characters and only one (my level 120-something melee build) has the witch plan. But my rifle build has the skeleton plan if your friend needs one of those? If I’m playing as the wrong character I’ll give you the ‘bye now’ wave, disappear, then come find you when I’ve logged back in. No mats or money needed.
---
Why do you say the handmade is faster though? They both have a fire rate of 75
---
Yup it's the best 2h melee weapon due to the armor ignore
---
same
---
I wouldn't want Far Harbour, but I do want a Pitt DLC that expands the map northward a bit. Especially in the northwest, so we can finally get the northern panhandle of West Virginia represented. The ruins of Pittsburgh, just starting to succumb to the disease that produces the wildmen, trogs, and other mutant abominations, would be the new northern limit.
---
Nope
---
Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
Collect a fuckton of iron and lead ore, and craft a fuckton of ammoooo
---
The guys in camp building development need to sit with kinggath.
---
Haha. Feck those random spawns! I know that feeling, but it’s such a thrill when you eventually see her body in the road (not a sentence I thought I’d be saying today!). It took me a good few days, but I was very determined not to give in. It became my life’s goal! I did read that sometimes the body will show up but without a plan on it. Can you imagine the crushing disappointment?! :-( I’m keeping my fingers crossed for you.
---
PSN Passion4TheHunt. Built a decent home. nothing special, just a real functional home. Please wipe your feet before entering and please close the door upon leaving.
---
They've changed it recently and now it looks like Sentinel before. I think it's the best looking paintjob for T-60 right now.
---
If that happens, body &amp; no plan I may take up drinking :D
---
Between 150 a day from the machine and the scrip you get from completing daily quests around the map, capping out at 1000 is pretty quick.
---
I also buy three star gear from vending machines if they’re cheap. I hit a camp last weekend that was having a fire sale with everything at 500c per 3star, and I’ve just been hitting my daily limit with those and a few extra 1-2 star junk in my stash.  It also helped with my problem of nearing the 30k cap limit. I got scrip, someone got like 15k caps in less than two minutes. Everyone’s happy.
---
I’m at about 700 scrip starting from less than 100 on Sunday, and then I swap to a different character to actually hunt more down. Having 2000 scrip to blow for the big sale should be no problem.
---
Well done dude! Earlier this week I were roaming the Savage divide when suddenly I encountered my first vengeful mothman!
---
Managed to get the best of it with my lvl81 heavy gunner, BUT, less than 5mins later, I kid you not, on the way to one of the train stations, I encountered a lvl80 legendary sheepsquatch!!! 
---
Literally thought that's it, I'm dead, as I didn't have many stimpacks on me, so first I hid below a small cliff but it found me and somehow didn't attack, just hovered above me so I took a photo of course, then thought fuckit, lets see so I attacked and managed to barely beat it. Reward sucked tho, got a lvl 30 combat knife with 1 star lol.
---
Has anyone here ever shot the Flatwoods Monster with the vox translator syringer gun? I think it would be a good idea if someone did that and got back to me
---
(hands over prewar money) shake it baby
---
I wonder the same specially with sneak so hi on mine how the hell do they see a invisable enemy.
---
Because stealth is broken and does not work when in groups. As soon as someone sees you, even a player, your stealth is broken.
---
Starting that whole boat thing just blow my mind back to ARK Evolved.
---
Great watching never knew there were so many places to get lead! 🏋️‍♂️
---
Well all mine appear blue in inventory until I right click to view them then they show true color, so I added a r, b and y to change name. Then must have been luck for me because every time I exited terminal to check which one I got I kept getting blues. Only consecutive buys got multi colored both times so I assumed it was the way dispensing worked. I just did this last night so also could be updated fix, if not then Sorry I couldn’t help
---
My take on it is that the events are designed as waves of creatures that attack the players. If they leave the stealth mechanic working then the creatures won't know where to "wave" towards and players would be able to hide and kill them easily. By effectively turning off stealth for the event the creatures will rush any/all players in the area - which is what you expect from a wave-based event.
---
...it does make it a bit more lively for bloodied builds - but there's got to be some downsides, right? :)
---
It's so you can cheese the event with crit damage. If you're high enough above the event you will go into caution sometimes. I jumped on the pole frequently and some prime meat places the the pole was the highest spot so I wasn't auto detected, just caution.
---
We did standard and novice everyday this week but we're still perfecting a expert run. That damn reactor with 4.5 minutes is a real pain.
---
I'll check this click to view in the eveing, maybe I also have all colors already?
---
Standard or Expert?
---
I’ve noticed a big drop in activity in this sub recently so maybe that idk ): also ty for posting it here, I wouldn’t have known otherwise... I’m really excited now
---
Thanks, I did at first but I arrived late, and didnt catch all of them.  I just watched the others and joined in... :)
---
I did the black powder and pistol challenges in one go in whitesoring with a black powder pistol and it took me about 4 hours, 3 of them spent reloading. 
---
I m not lying i actually fell asleep once doing it.
---
At least rank 1 of each is nice. Rank 3 of each doesn't give you much more for the point cost
---
Bandolier (max) , sturdy frame (max) , traveling pharmacy (max), strong back (3), portable power (max) for the 2 power armor sets I carry, batteries included (max), thru hiker (2) and good with salt (max). With bloodied build and unyielding, radicool, and nerd rage, it isn't so bad with the carry weight.
---
Who really wants to be harvesting lead while launching a nuke, I mean I get multi tasking but those barbells are super heavy till you find someplace to scrap them.
---
I am 3 runs away from getting it. Run it every day, all 3 levels on this weeks
---
I read that those helmets are messed up for some time and I believe it's a very low priority on any fix lists, so I gave up on getting them all. I got all other outfits possible in the game (including Winter Man Faschnacht mask and Hunter's hood), I only miss Jester and Goblin masks that didn't drop on PC and Hunter's Pelt (which is not officially available).
---
That’s very true!
---
I didn;t realise it could be swapped for legendary scrip,..,... I just put what I had on the BBQ ( only had about 12 pieces anyway).... Im rather disappointed at the amount of ammo I have to use, just to get to the BBQ and then get rubbish.  The drops from the Final boss ( Sheepsquatch in Ash heap mainly) were far more satisfying to me :) ... To get Scrip do you have to trade it at the Purveyor or at any Legendary Vending machine at Rail Stations? ( not that I have any left... Haven't done any for ages)  :)
---
after you learn all other lining plans you can buy it from the bot vendors, thats how i got mines, I forgot what vendor i got it from tho, watoga maybe.
---
Exactly my thoiughts too my friend.... Only got 4.... couldnt add it... couldnt work out WHY I couldnt add it, spent the whole cook out running around after squirrels
---
On expert: having 03:30 on the clock once you get to the break room is enough, although it's possible to get there 30-60 seconds faster. Have someone with lockpick 3 run straight to the workroom/council rooms, and pick the lock to immediately find the next key.
---
Practice makes perfect in the reactor room, and you ideally want to hit the emergency restart button with 02:30+ on the clock. It takes about a minute for the door to agriculture to open. You'll get 1 minute added to the timer once you open the door, so your timer will still be at 02:30+.
---
For the agriculture, have one person on pipes in the cave, one on pipes in the greenhouses, and two in the pump room area. The two pump roomers should have written down or taken a picture of the pump reset codes. All pipes + pump codes should be finished around the same time and you'll have roughly 3:30 - 4:30 on the clock once the Strangler Heart opens. 
---
If you're on Ps4, feel free to join us for a run!
---
I don't even know if scorched angler is on the list. Where was it anyway?
---
"Yup" is right.
---
I watched the video and haven't seen anything BoS related?!?! Am I missing something?
---
Literally spent 700 scrip on it rip
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
got an AAE combat rifle though so nbd I suppose.
---
 One of my alts has a Quad Lever Action, and 20 in a row is kinda beastly.
---
👍
---
&gt; Vault 
---
This happened to me as well when I took over a workshop. Guy killed me three times before I could realise what happen. I quite the server and they followed me. I had to block them on xbox. Was rather annoying.
---
Furious Shovel was excellent
---
 It would never occur to me to just stand out there taking fire, so this has always seemed a useless thing. ;)
---
 In the beginning the Hunting Rifle is the bomb, and you should learn to hide, while it takes its sweet time to both cycle and reload.
---
Yes.Just take off join team tab in main menu
---
Lol, just obsessive compulsive on owning every look 😂
---
Does that pit you against other solos or is it still solo vs teams
---
its not all true, the bot vendor does has a chance to spawn,  my camp next to the charleston station for 99% of my play time(500+ hours) and he does shows up once in a while.
---
your camp been there will not stop him from spawning, as well as it could spawn in other places.
---

There it is , it has evolved a lot, this is from months ago and I wont be on my comp for few days right now.
---
It just works.
---
Tse is overvalued by noobs, its one of the worst prefixes. Only ghoul slayer, nocturnal, hunter is worse.
---
Yes, lately I lost those like half the time I play. Need to change server to fix it.
---
If anyone has to carry 100 plus stims you are doing something wrong, i can play for 4to5 hours and only use 20 to 30 diluted stims . Carnivore mutation allows you to use uncooked meat with no chance of disease so you can instantly eat what you kill . My usual weight is about 200 of 280
---
definitely. The rendering delays and black screen drops to homescreen are killer. The intermittent freezes are frustrating. There is some bug which i am trying to pin down exactly how to do it but when it freezes while you are in the air, you can sometimes jump again which throws you 50 feet into the air like a slingshot. I do have mutations that help the jump but never have been shot into the air repeatedly as the last few days. Something to do with the jump button and crouch while freezing. Xb1, level 202.
---
My poor poor scrip :(
---
Isn't it just throwing away ammo with extra steps?
---
Hi. I am an Xbox gamer.  
---
Since patch12, I got freeze trouble when I open maps,friend list(Social function of game), and use Xbox button(for take screenshots,accept invite etc...).  
---
I found your reddit post in Twitter.  
---
I send report to Bethesda support about my trouble issue.(2 days ago)  
---
They said template thing of tecnical (open port,re-install etc...)  
---
But it's not work. Bethesda said please contact to Microsoft customer support.  
---
I did. But MS support said that looks like issue of game proglams.  
---
So I reply to Bethesda support about MS support said.  
---
I said could you try to clear my friend list? But they didn't touch about this friend list issue.  
---
When I open Fallout76 today, my friend list was gone(in game) and my issue fixed all.  
---
Nothing got freeze when I open.(but bethesda still don't tell about this)
---
I’m glad someone else is!
---
Come to PC and play with the clown again.  His camp is so ugly.
---
Lol are u talking about clown daddy?
---
Yes please.
---
When ever I meet Mirelurk Queen I just pull out my Vampire minigun. It's not about damage anymore and all about surviving.
---
Hahaha, ok, next time I meet you or stop by your shop, I'm gonna immediately eat..ekhem, pay the fee I owe you :D
---
Sorry to hear about rude customers though, your shop is really cute!
---
The point is that it’s still harassing and annoying when someone obviously doesn’t wanna play along
---
Oh yeah that's true! I forgot about vault 94 :O
---
They never said that they continue to bother them if they don't retaliate.
---
Aw I do miss that clown lol. He’s a great wee dancer don’t u know 😉 maybe one day I will afford to by a good pc and then I’ll be straight over there 😃
---
For smelting all the lead ore, you can hit up Tanagra Town that has all those bugs in it that drop a nice amount of acid. Also taking advantage of the Primal Cuts event in the Ash Heap also has those same bugs spawn in the first 2 waves.
---
I'm one of the lucky ones I guess, didn't use the mystery pick "reward".
---
However it should have been better tested at minimum. With all that negativity around, everything should be double and triple tested before release.
---
Better than my 2 shot. Accuracy is there
---
Im surprised too, ive had lots of disconnects on console in EU but everyone always said US servers were fine
---
Why am i not surprised. Lolz

---
I, for one, think it's "suspicious" (It's at least obvious they've been tinkering with the script up to the sale, which pretty much says eveything).
---
agreed!  With all the terrible mistakes/bugs/glitches and other wackery that's gone on since launch and with wastelanders literally right around the corner you would think they would be Dotting the i's and Crossing the t's at this stage in the game.
---
same here i been to a couple queen fights and i have killed atleast a couple yao gui's and it didn't register for me either.    i been stuck at 2/3
---
Two plans for Salty Tenderisers great what to do with them eh? Why dish out the Mod plans but no Tenderiser?? Why is the Purveyor thing so crap? Two hundred scrip for a pipe revolver, a flamer that eats fuel and a legendary pool cue wtf??? Really made meat week worth it - not! I totally get why if everyone got a TSE shotgun everyone would be winning but on the same token it is unfair when 1 person wins a pool cue and the next person wins a quadruple shot, exploding, 90% light arse kicker.
---
Ahh that's cool. I've never worked with gamers.
---
I tried to kill one when my character was at 25-30, nearly downed it when the plasma grenade killed my character due to lag, respawned and went back to the same location, it's gone.
---
I'll add you when I get home from work this afternoon
---
I might be because Beth has a long-term scheme in regards to free/atoms; they want to ease you in to the "Atom Shop", get used to spending on it, then you will be more likely to BUY "Atoms" for REAL MONEY when there's no more "Atoms" left to gain from the game (apart from the dailies (have phun grinding, oh and welcome to GTAO)).
---
It is indeed the particles. It’s bad at the queen because the particles apply to literally EVERY enemy, including dead ones, which makes everyone else around lag uncontrollably, while you’ll barely notice anything.
---
I know they talked about putting in public test servers at some point, but to me it should be a priority, particularly with something huge like Wastelanders on the horizon. The bug you mentioned is proof that players can find issues within minutes of something going live. Issues that the employees just don't find or don't look for.
---
I loved the OG survival mode and that's all I played until they nerfed the weapons and my handmade went from doing max damage to, if i remember correctly, 6 damage per shot. I spent months tweaking my character and didn't have it in my to do it again.
---
Sucks being a gamer around people who don't give a shit

or the laser musket.
---
These people selling the items would be using VPNs with alternate accounts.
---
With you on that...
---
Too right. They are not using rng and are limiting the roll of good perks.
---
One shot by whom?
---
Wow, you really pissed people off for explaining something in a way that uses the word "American". Must really suck to be as fragile as those people.
---
Idk man think about it like this, what if you wanna play the game with no hostility from another player who could or could not have an advantage over you? Where does that put us? The argument here is that people who force you to combat them are taking it to a level where it gets annoying. You have to realize that not everyone wants to initiate in pvp but when someone forces you to do it by continuously killing you over and over and over it get ridiculously frustrating cause at that point you can’t even play the game without having to pvp and even if you manage to win you still have those people who just won’t give up and keep coming back it gets tiring and old man. The op is not assuming everyone from survival mode is an asshole he is only talking about those certain people who go out of their way to be an asshole in game. Most people don’t want to pvp because they are busy doing other stuff like quests or exploring or role playing and we didn’t even ask for survival mode to be taken out so idk what Bethesda was thinking when they made that decision but the point is if someone doesn’t want to pvp then don’t FORCE them to that’s the argument here . If you wanna pvp go find someone who has the time to play with you don’t force other people to pvp just because it’s a pvp game .
---
I love power armor, but I'm over weight in it since the backpacks came out. My weight is around 440 to 510. Hi capacity backpack, unyielding pocketed armor,  and low health. Grilled Radstag and whiskey helps. Right now I'm over weight with legendarys, and I have a hard time dropping things of value. I would give them to friends, but most of them stopped playing.
---
Things like the fake sheepsquatch, level 50 mister handies and etc
---
OR he just wants to enjoy the event with a few others who aren't one-shot arseholes, ever think of this?
---
Anyway I would prefer 3 locations to have UF event, that way it spreads out the players instead of being in just one.
---
Are you Rad'd to the gills?
---
&gt;TSE shotgun
---
yikers
---
There is a vault jumpsuit you can craft and wear over armor.
---
There is a Mods lists for Weapons and Armour, is that what you are looking for?
---
I got full health little to no rads
---
My “running weight” is generally under 150.
---
Until over-encumbered from picking up stuff, I don’t equip any of the weight optimization perks.  I do prefer armour with the various 20% weight reductions. 
---
Generally, my load-out is:
---
2 weapons with 1000 ammo each
---
10 Stimpacks and 20 diluted stimpacks
---
5 Radaways
---
1 disease cure
---
10-20 Corn soup
---
3-4 repair kits (from SBQ)
---
10-20 Assorted chems depending on build
---
2 Power Armours (for fighting in Rad.Zones and Excavator for fast traveling after farming)
---
From time to time, I may carry 2 more weapons for experimenting or for fun.
---
Stealth bonus + faster movement in sneak.
---
Repeat.
---
1000 times faster to make one purchase in eBay than to set up a selling eBay account w/feedback + new duping accounts + new mule accounts + new delivery accounts… + all the logistic crap dupers need for the "business".
---
The undamaged fan from what I remember is in a locked room in the Blackwater mine.
---
Exactly... why would there only be limb damage if it was RNG? This LImb damage thing is always happening... they thinkered with the probabilities....
---
&gt; scortchbeasts are skyrim dragons
---
Count the legs.
---
(Which is, by the way, odd.  Scorchbeasts are supposed to be mutated/infected bats, so they should have 2 legs and 2 wings like Skyrim Dragons, but instead they have 4 legs and 2 wings, like many mythological dragons.  Go figure.)
---
Would be kinda funny if someone were to answer each and every one of your pictures with a different pic showing a bug that hasn't been squashed \^\^
---
It seems like Tenderizer is not working. Dmg numbers don't get boosted after the first shot on enemy; several players in here have said the same. 
---
I would however love to see some conclusive answer.
---
Any time after 3pm eastern time
---
Only reg Scorched and SBQ has registered for me as well. Definitely killed scorched megasloth at repair yard and it had not counted. As well as the many other creatures I helped kill in Scorched Earth event.
---
I ran standard two days in a row with no issues, on Xbox. My biggest issue is the lack of rewards. I've crafted 3 thorn armor pieces, and none of them had a desired perk set (hunters, exterminator, and I think the third was junkie).
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of two-shot for this exact reason.
---
No problemo!
---
I’ve experienced at least that much per gaming session.
---
Thanks! I wish I could trade in the third star for 5 scrip lol
---
Guessing you're responding to my question in the EDIT part of my post..
---
That's a great map with lots of info, but what I mean is how/where to make such a thing yourself. I looked myself some time ago but didn't find any easy way of doing it.
---
That’s my main motivator for staying put.  Recreating on purpose a thing that I originally did by fluke would probably be very frustrating!
---
Yeah, until I read about the bug a while back, it was a "better than nothing" effect.
---
Good idea, Grafton day could work really well if they beefed it up, except that it's an early event area for lower level players, I remember XP farming it around L15-20 so either you ruin it for lower levels or higher levels won't bother attending.
---
Every fucking game every nowadays has a mystery Random loot generator of some kind.. the fact that Bethesda can’t manage to even get something as simple as a fair random loot drop system is embarrassing.. coding a random number generator is one of the first things you’ll ever get thought if you try to learn to code..
---
Hit me up, my psn is Themightyboop. i have (what i think) is a nice homestead set up.
---
Well. That thing is a beast for everyone to be fair

I can milk those? I had no idea. Thanks.

This is my rifle build. Vats crit sneak based. Works very well, the str and endurance perk can be swapped to whatever. You get a crit every third shot . I run lever guns though, scopes feel so "off" in fallout after playing other fps games I just run vats since it's a core mechanic. I never ran vats in the old fallouts because it paused the game, I LOVE the "live" vats in this game.
---
Well played 😉
---
Congrats!

For future reference, NOBODY outside this sub cares about 76, except for maybe those gaming youtubers who do “What went wrong?” videos.

I just picked up a Vampires Tesla yesterday. Does it regen health with every enemy hit? Or just for the first one?
---
I plan on testing it tonight.
---
"Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. His eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red like the fires of Hell."

Same

Turn it around. It takes me 30 seconds in the morning to hit the scrip limit. Then I just play normally, collecting tomorrows scrip at leisure.
---
I have barely any experience when it comes to coding.. I did a couple of years of IT in college.. I can safely say I know practically fuck all about coding.. however in those IT Lessons we were taught the basics of coding.. and the VERY first thing we learned to code in class was a random number generator... RNG.. IF RNG IS THE FIRST THING THEY ARE TEACHING ME ABOUT CODING IN SCHOOL THEN WHY THE FUCK CAN SOME DEVELOPERS WHO ARE LAID TO DO THIS SHIT NOT GET IT RIGHT?
---
It's unfortunate, but people deal with the glitches as long as they get their weekly candy from the atom shop. It doesn't feel so much like a game anymore as a lobby for the shop. Soon ammo crates will be available or something.
---
Would this be possible /u/valseek or /u/LadyDevann ?
---
I am on Xbox. I can figure it out I’m sure :) thank you so much for this info.
---
After you "earn one" the hard way, they will start showing up more regularly. Not sure if it is coded that way, but much of the game does seem to work that way.
---
Yw
---
And thanks so much for the offer! I’ll shout you if I genuinely get stuck.
---
Scrip packs is my next guess ngl..
---
It happens automatically, as soon as you put the five Prime Meats on the barbecue it added five scrip to your collection. You can see how much you have under the collections tab in the Pip-Boy
---
Ok,np
---
I will never buy a Bethseda release again.  I think the purveyor is being manipulated in a negative way for the consumer. Dodgy bast\*&amp;ds.
---
I got this reference
---
Grafton day should have been a big community event like fashnacht.
---
There was a poster with power armor on it.
---
Ah yes triple aaa. Or AAAAAAAAA
---
There's a lot more to random loot systems than just picking a random number.  But to give an example I think is more suitable: the physics engine was (maybe still is?) tied to frame rate.  That's one of the most fundamental errors in game dev, and it's not that hard to multiply everything by dt each frame, and make a few other changes, so that it's no longer tied to frame rate.  The fact they didn't do this is a great indication that they either don't know what they're doing, or don't care enough.
---
Assuming its connected to your friendlist, the only thing you can do is to remove as many inactive people as you can until they release a fix for the social menu related issues.
---
It's convenient how 90% of the stories in here end with "disconnected from server". Very convenient, hmm...
---
I got pretty lucky yesterday with my rolls.
---
VE reduced weight Handmade
---
BFF faster movement gatling plasma
---
3* Instigating Crossbow (cant remember other 2)
---
3* Instigating plasma pistol (can't remember other 2)
---
A couple more decent weapons too.
---
Some general things:
---
-	Is your gear repaired? (just checking)
---
-	Damage reduction is always better than damage resistance 
---
-	The following perks give damage reduction Blocker, Fireproof, Lone wanderer, Dodgy (with enough AP), serendipity (at low health, not in power armor), Richocet
---
-	The mod emergency protocols reduces damage by 50% while below 20% health
---

Those affixes are all good, but situational in their usefulness, Executioners is useless on weapons like the super sledge where you want one hit kills, instigating is bad on automatics, furious on slow attackers, sure one of them is probably going to be better on any given weapon than mutants, but mutants is never bad in any case, 10% more damage is 10% more damage no matter what weapon you are using.
---
Got an Anti Armor +50 limb damage Weightless Power fist not complaning at all
---
I think all the rare legendary mobs should. Mothman, Sheepsquatch, Flatwoods Monster...
---
But I honestly don’t care if there’s more to it.. ive never in my life seen a game get a random loot generator wrong.. we’re almost in 2020 we’re not still In the ps3 era where most company’s are just getting their foot in the door... Bethesda have been doing this longer than nearly any other game company there is left at this point.. how are they still getting is so wrong? They don’t care that’s how.. and I’m bored of defending the game.. game development is definitely hard.. it’s why I decided to to go down that route.. but it shouldn’t be this fucking hard 🤷‍♂️
---
People like you shouldn't be allowed keyboards.
---
I don’t have the Pro, but the video quality on The Last Of Us, Metro Collection, Fallout4?! and many others impressed me! 
---
I saw online videos of Fallout76 gameplay sessions and it looked far better than what i’m getting, i use the network connection with cable and i live in Bucharest, Romania(the network’s speed and quality is as good as you can get in the entire world).
---
I was thinking to waste some money to get the Pro, but if you say you have the same problem, i will wait for the 5...
---
IMO there isn't a better one for a pve rifleman or commando. I have gone through just about every variation of explosive handmade and keep coming back to the quad. Anything else and I am spending more time reloading than killing. 
---
The only thing I have not picked up in a handmade is bloodied explosive. If I get one of those I may put my quad away.
---
This post is lacking in common sense. The whole point of them being limited edition is that it pushes you to buy it
---
After watching a couple of videos from juicehead and Luke Stephens I think that the situation of Bethesda in general now is very different from what we think from the outside. It seems that BGS has almost completely gone out of the picture from Fo76, giving up all the handling to their partners dedicated to managing the multiplayer context. Looks like BGS is in full development of the next single player releases, but Fo76 is not being managed how it should be
---
It seems like everyone still have 1 quest missing. Mine is the vox syringer that i loved doing that 1 time 1000 hours ago.
---
Queen of the hunt and all others work.
---
The pro is definitely worth it for other games but so far with fallout 76 it’s been terrible. I’m not sure if it’s a bug or what but game performance has been terrible.
---
There's plenty of examples of errors in loot systems in other games.  I don't want to defend their RNG system though, just didn't want people thinking that stochastic game mechanics are a simple matter.
---
They took away our ability to destroy C.A.M.P.s at will so we had to get creative.
---
So basically what you’re saying is, at some point every item becomes free? Think about if that makes sense financially
---
*kick gum and chew ass
---
Junkies is a good replacement if you dont like bloodied. I run a sniper build that goes hw for events.  My best sniper weapon is a 1 star instigating lever action.  With all stealth perks at night, hits for around 2600 damage, enough to one hit gutsys.
---
Where LVL 40 player build his camp to drag him hostile Assaultron? If Cranberry Bog I suggest changing location. Game spawns enemies when players visits locations and it happening many times, so don't be surprise they're spawning near you location. If you have gear that isn't allow you to kill those enemies quickly, I suggest moving back to forest are.
---
This idea really needs to be implemented, as there are some who just cant get teams due to timing and irl stuff.
---
Granted they want players to team up, but all content should be solo-able, perhaps just for less rewards (eg: less Vault steel), but still able to learn unique plans
---
What they really need is a LFG queue so all us solo players can easily find a group in-game.
---
Thanks!
---
There are 2 was to move it, one from the pipboy that moves the whole camp, and from the build menu, only moves the camp item.
---
I'm not a sniper build but I do use 4 pieces of powered unyielding armor and a Instigating Lever Action with 25% Faster Fire Rate along with 1 rank of each Riflemen perk and a level 3 sneak and I can constantly 1 shot most enemies that I lock onto with vats. I do have high perception 20 or 21 I'm sure that helps. Pistols could use a buff but my  favorite pistol my Bloodied Explosive Pipe Pistol does 571 damage and my Bloodied 44 does 351 damage.
---
It seems like there's always a lvl 50 Legendary Sheepsquatch camping around that house. 
---
When I had to grab the Overseer's Log from there, I stared at that thing for maybe 20 minutes hoping it would go somewhere else so I could get the Log and get out of there. But I decided to go and try to sneak by it using a stealth boy and my (then) pitiful sneak ability and was successful.
---
You not pissed off that it could have been FSS  with +STR ? I am seriously hacked off that my instigating and bloodied DCGs that dropped are both second rate and that I had zero chance of getting top rolls due to Bugthesda.
---
on pc you can edit the .ini files but otherwise no
---
I'm South West side of the map, by the river bordering Forest and Ash Heap. It's also that the players will just hang out there not really doing anything. 
---
If think all camps would draw attacks at some point, this is just ridiculous and seemingly continuous to the point I just log off the server.
---
I realize the title could have been more descriptive:
---
FreeStater, Jesus and Juan Diego Sunday, survived the bombs and the fall of Harpers Ferry, only for Jesus to murder JD, before falling to another group of survivors led by JD’s girlfriend, Brianna Hawke.
---
I had a Vampire/Swing Speed shovel somebody gave me like, 6k for. haha
---
Sorry, as standard the fixer is 48 semi auto and loses 4(?) dmg full auto so 44. The handmade as standard has 45 at fully auto.
---
Same for me. Every notification on top left stop poping after some random times. Same goes for quest rewards and legendary loot notification that should pop in the middle of the screen.
---
And even older thing is the bass line not playing... For many it may be a cool thing, but I love it and I miss it when it stops working...
---
Hundreds of levels and a thousand hours to come to this realization.  
---
I’d venture to say only Bethesda titles reach that level of play in all the games you have. Maybe GTA. 
---
Imo it’s already paid for itself. Twice over. If you really thought or think it was that bad you could have stopped playing it at any time. 
---
But who doesn’t love bitching anonymously on the interwebs.
---
Ugh the nerfs were so bad! Guns might as well shoot confetti and paper snakes for all the damage they did! And at first I thought no map markers might help but ultimately it made it very boring. Bummed me out so hard to watch everyone leave and watch survival die a slow death. They should of just axed it back in August if the plan was to bring it down anyway. I was hitting a real stride too, had some fun beefs going with some other players.
---
I know what you want, but I'm asking the guy who's offering to make you this magical vault suit that can be worn over armour.
---
 I dont think it exists, I'm pretty sure he's gonna make you a vault jumpsuit.
---
Well I don't know what to tell ya man I don't lag at all with it even in the vault where lag is crazy sometimes. It's weird that it would affect some users and not others. Either way tho that sucks.
---
Ahh ok, I'll have to double check when i get back online, as I only use SAR's.
---
I do a lot of queen runs, and have heard that an Auto receiver is better than a Semi, so I do need to look into the Commando perks to test it out
---
I don't know the answer, but i do know that you will not die from anything other than the rads or during reload. have speed demon to reload faster and you should be fine though. Have one myself, used it quite a bit at the WS many levels ago. Get them aggro and start zapping.
---
I want separate tab for food too.
---
Does the radiation from the shot can trigger mutation?
---
😭
---
Yeah, this posses my off so much. I spend so much time checking the other locations, then when I finally get to the right location, there is already a sweaty meat sack in power armor that waits for the other locations to disappear and then swoops in and kills the legendary. While I get nothing . One of the most infuriating Events when this happens
---
That doesn't help the weapon , but good general suggestion.
---
Auto receiver drops damage but increases fire rate ofc, but apparently drops dps too?
---
Not surprised that they are recruiting! And if they offer me enough, I will certainly sort that crap out for them!
---
Just imagine if you could hold the trigger down like the Gauss. Imagine if they used something that is already in the game and wouldn't take long to implement.
---
I think it is called "heavy" because it looks like the heavy mod from the standard sledgehammer. The only weapon that comes with the heavy super sledge mod is the All Rise.
---
Any assaultron head dropped when they could still be explosive actually doesnt irradiate the user, i found a bloodied damage while aiming one in a vendor a couple weeks ago like that, with no irratiates the user text, and it doesnt.
---
Im not entirely sure.
---
I did pick up an AA handmade last week, so will be testing Auto vs Semi at some point next week
---
I play on Xbox and I never have any issues finding people to run with when I log on. It’s a pretty solid community.
---
Let me know. Have you got a gauss by any chance? To tell me base damage cos im in process of building a commando.
---
It would actually use it more if that happens.
---
One time a guy brought a radscorpion to my base. He had to trail it so far, it was pretty funny.
---
If they could have the enemies scale up for the event, or spawn multiple grafton monsters I'd be up for this. Just have a whole parade of them. As it is you show up, one shot the grafton monster and the event is done. It would be over as soon as the first person arrived
---
I have an AA Gauss ive had for a long time, i believe the base dmg on mine is 206, but that may be with perks
---
I'll reply to this post once I'm able to get back online and have a look
---
So basically there are two back-to-back post-release events that is specifically geared against solo bloodied builds (Encryptid, Meat Week)
---
Grafting Day is weak
---
Any Weightless assaultrons head is invaluable to bloodied build because it weighs less than a pound and can be used to trigger nerd Rage extremely easily again if you die. You can use a regular one too but it's 8 pounds.
---
Same thing is happening to me, on PC.
---
No.
---
And here's me who stops caring about leveling up once my characters have all the useful perk cards, which is around level 60-70. Legendary characters might change this tho.
---
When I want to try a completely different build, I simply make a new character rather than change my special point placement.
---
Looks like you were right!
---
Not True, between waves I was Hidden, as soon as the next wave started I went to \[DANGER\]
---
Learn to work with people. Don’t have Bethesda change the game mechanics just because you “are only a solo player”.
---
Yeah, the option to initiate the quest doesn’t pop up
---
It fucks up Berserker Builds as well (One of the more balanced/ weaker player builds)
---
Hanlon's razor my friend, this is a perfect example.
---
Fallout 76 does have companions
---
I’m on PS4 too, and those work for me
---
&gt;It's so you can't cheese the event with crit damage
---
It was one of my suspicions as well
---
Heard it's being done with cleavers. I don't understand why. Steel isn't exactly hard to come by legitly.
---
I noticed last night with a number of other PA users that we got DESTROYED fairly easily while in PA... exited my PA, got back in, back to normal. I’d suggest trying again. 
---
Also, my PA showed two sets in my pipboy when this was happening. Might be a new bug. Will see if I can replicate it this weekend. Happened to at least three of us last night.
---
It means don't get on a Boeing aircraft
---
I think that would be a bit overpowered, i personally wouldn't like that. I'd rather just have more that 150 trade in per day.
---
I went once and did three scrip rolls....all three were wood left arms - 2 were the exact same legendaries and the 3rd was very similar. Lol
---
Not my problem you can't check your fire or enable Pacifist. 
---
If I shoot you, it was almost certainly intentional.
---
It's currently 36th most played game on xbox (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox).
---
So pretty big I reckon.
---
This sounds like fun!
---
PSN Nombatty
---
I have a Quad / vats crit / reload asssultron head. It can one shot a lvl80 scorched beast, without even having the perks maxed
---
I loved the Pitt. And I'd love to see anything Pennsylvania in a fallout game! Lots of potential there.
---
Given the number of bugs and their periodic reintroduction, I too would side with stupidity.
---
I made a mod that remove those lines... But I haven't published it because well... I'm a sociopath and replaced it with Preston Garvey asking you weird things.
---
The base damage is around 140 I'm pretty sure
---
Yah had this happen to me last night.  Bored griefers.  Tried to bait me into fighting with a TSE, then when I left pure some mobs to my camp to trash it.  Luckily I suspected much, came back and server hopped.
---
Do you have boost mode turned on in the PS4 Pro settings? If so turn it off and then try playing to see if it makes it better. I've come to find out that boost mode will actually hurt a lot of times instead of helping.
---
3 people playing 5 games = 15 separate games. 3 disconects = game working 80%.
---
Everyone you talk to doesn't sound like they actually run the raids then man. I just got the full strangler set on xbox yesterday and I've been running it daily with our groups none of us found it even remotely "unplayable" he'll we finish standard with 18 min left to spare and 2-3 min to spare on expert. I think some people get a little too dramatic about how "bad" these vault raids are.
---
Given the circumstances (small indy dev group, no experience with FO previously, patchwork code to make a single player into multiplayer, etc. etc.), it really makes sense.
---
That said, the mothership has a track record of trying to over-monetize games recently, to the detriment of the whole game.  I'm all for adjusting the tinfoil hat as needed, just not pulling it all the way down over my eyes.
---
A lot of the problems seem to stem from the fact that the FO76 team is \*apparently\* small, so small they can't do their jobs effectively and thoroughly.  
---
When the beta/test server comes online this will help a hell of a lot.
---
At least 12.  Probably more.
---
or he get's a drill....
---
I’ll check that when I’m on next but I wouldn’t think that would have an effect on fo76 as it’s for improving games and aren’t PS4 pro enhanced.
---
Using broken armor is clever, but I have no idea if it will work like you hope it will. I would love to see a viable Berserker build, but as it is junkies gives the same damage boost (I think?) and at negligible drawbacks. Berserker needs a buff. Should have a perk similar til Nerd rage IMO
---
Lol we were playing the same matches
---
Bethesda has the Bill oreilly approach to testing.
---
IT WORKS NOW! 10.04.19
---
I think I've had maybe 1 disconnect in NW ever. I'll only spend an hour or two on thete a week but it's crazy what a different experience were having.
---
&gt; Meant the further one we will have 
---
Not will.  Might.
---
I also got a Fat Man from her. My other ranged weapon was a Hunters Tesla Rifle.
---
Pedo guy
---
me: logs in 
---
Grafton mayor: *its ya boy grafton mayor*
---
I think it only happens when you are using any weapon with high fire rate+explosive?  Best solution for now is to carry a second power armor with you, Wich is sad
---
Your right, and I can't explain it. I just know from personal experience that Boost Mode can hurt more than  helping.
---
Add the chances to those plans at novice lets say at a lower chance id support that, like 1 in 4 runs or similar but guaranteed chance should stay in standard and expert for all the timing work among your 2 or 3 teammates.
---
dood its bethesda. bethesda games are always buggy :\^) hehe good old funny bethesda bugs
---
It's not *too* bad for me, but I lost a couple people from my regular squad because of the lag spikes. Seemed to start getting worse after the last patch.
---
That's terrible. I've had disconnects in the main game, but not NW. I live in China, so I figured I had it worse than most since none of the servers are nearby (melee is so lagged). If they can't even get it to work in their own country then something's broken.
---
Why should anyone outside Bethesda do their job for them?
---
I’m using a pro and my daughter has a normal PS4 in her room. I’ve just got another copy of the game so I can pass caps to my other characters. My daughter has a hd tv the same but the quality of the picture is way poorer in her game. The normal PS4 looks cartoonish compared to the pro, there’s a huge difference. The only thing I’ve noticed on the pro is it disconnects way more.
---
Yes, same here. I won’t even get notifications for events.
---
Fortunately, I heard about it before doing a mystery roll. For 60 scrip as a melee player, I'll just take the roll for 3-star armor instead.
---
Having to spend SPECIAL points on crippling ranged perks just to get Scorchbeasts to land and keycard drones to slow down and Bloodied VATS snipers OHKOing legendaries at public events is bad enough, but it seems finding ways to screw over melee players has become a bit of an in-house hobby for the 76 team.
---
Yeah not saying it looks bad. The graphic actually look pretty good. It’s just always bad FPS for me which makes it hard to play and idk how to fix it. Movement starts to feel really sluggish and combat becomes difficult/annoying. Gets to the point where I can no longer be bothered playing and I just get off.
---
A BE gatling plasma with a beam splitter freezes pretty fast so I could see that being true.
---
Several people and also a dataminer have confirmed it does not work in power armor.
---
With any receiver (semi, full auto, hardened, whatever) it does more damage than a handmade with the same receiver.
---
It is also lighter than an equivalent handmade and gives improved stealth and faster movement while sneaking.
---
And it takes the more common .45 ammo instead if 5.56mm ammo.
---
Enough?
---
I've taken it to bring molotovs with me to that event and to One Violent Night.
---
They cover a wide area, are cheap to make and don't cause bodies to clip through collisions.
---
Not ideal but trying to make the most of a design choice I find disagreeable because there is sweet fuck all I can do to change it.
---
Better? Quad Assaultron Heads are one of the most overpowered weapons in the game.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed a lag when I play, like having to hit the same button loads of times before it’s done anything or I spawn in and run and it puts me back to the spawn point. It’s not like that on my daughters but like I said it just looks awful.
---
For the 1,000,000th time, if you claim a workshop you should have zero expectations for your safety.  
---
I’ve claimed shops for materials (mostly cores) but also to PvP after all that’s what it was designed for.  
---
And yes, I’ve been killed plenty of times in the process but don’t go whining to Bethesda about it.
---
Sweet haha
---
they really need common mmo support concepts like LFG queue like you said but also things like in game guilds (yes I know discord but you can't join unless your already on friends list into worlds) so people can easily group up on same worlds and such
---
Nobody said "should".
---
It's standard in the industry that MMOs (and MMO wannabe's like FO76) have test servers that some players enjoy testing game content on before general release. That means the volunteer testers are happy, the regular players are happy, the company is happy and there's a lot less bugs.
---
  
---
Usually for a game that is online and getting new regular content there's either a subscription involved and/or DLC costs. (at least at the start until it goes F2P). Obviously there's none of those costs with FO76, which could be used as a justification for such a small team. The business model simply will not allow for this unless in-game purchases bring in a lot of revenue.  
---
Either way, it's been standard practice for decades now for test servers that players can use.
---
They should also take off the events that happen at night as there are only 3 (one violent night, campfire tales, and the Path to Enlightenment) and they can only occur during the night. to get both nighttime, event cooldown. and RNG to make those quests possible is a nightmare.
---
L142, a bit over 600 hrs, and no, not really. 
---
One endgame item left on my to-do list, along with a lot of little things. 
---
I have been in several SBQ battles, but I  haven't dropped a nuke.  
---
For the little stuff...
---
There are a few events I haven't done, a couple of locations I haven't fully explored.
---
Missed the first meat week; last week provided that opportunity.
---
etc.
---
I think it verfies for each person.
---
They are doable once you find a "god no lag server" but those barely can be found,
---
Tested berserker in a few different ways. Not worth it at all. Low damage for high risk. Wouldn't recommend using it at all.
---
The last match I played my screen turned black 2 seconds after loading in.  I could still hear and talk to my group only couldn't do shit.  Eventually my screen came back but then went black another 2 seconds later.  Then eventually it came back just in time for me to be dead.
---
you try restarting your game?
---
I would love some new kick ass perk cards that start at lvl 100 and come in increments of 50....almost God level perk cards... because honestly, I'm not seeing any benefits beyond that. I don't even mess with my level ups anymore. Maybe once I get enough, I'll re-spec for fun.
---
I'm still missing a piece of armor for the full set, but maybe you could do some experiment and try another weapons and post results? You can remove the power armor paint so no one suspects it's yours .
---
I'm not going to stop buying games from BGS. But they won't ever get a pre order, full price or in game purchase from me again. Moved on from 76  2 months ago and I'm enjoying my free time much more.
---
I understood that reference
---
Remove all clothing, remove all perks and fully suppress mutations, time out foods and chems.
---
Restart game.
---
Test in this raw state.
---
I think it was in the forest but I’m not sure.  I remember your name was spelled out with a bunch of different light up letters
---
They axed survival mode. RIP
---
events update is THE single worst update I've ever experienced in a video game. may not be the worst ever, but definitely worst I've ever experienced. I've nothing to do now. Game has content that I can not access. This is ridiculous.
---
As my 5th, it would definitely be as a "challenge" ...
---
PvP is the only reason I still play.
---
But that can be extremely exploited
---
I just wish scrapper applied to all scrap or had multiple levels to it to expand it's uses.
---
Meat Week broke it because of all the Primal Cuts indications popping up at once as public events this time. Seems like they'll have to do something to the servers if the error is persisting.
---
Happens every time I come in. Has for 3 days now. Makes playing almost unbearable. I’ve tried everything at this point.
---
They should remove all the dross from the legendary list to make Mr Mumbles less dreadful and annoying.
---
"We'll do it live because the thing sucks."

---
Mate i’m in Australia, and I only have disconnects due to my stupid internet provider. Not to sure why you’re getting them
---
I've never come across this mate so I can't offer any advice outside of reinstalling the game
---
You can certainly let others know if you feel like diminishing your chances to win haha
---
Ok just tried that. Even putting all armor and weapons in my stash. Still doing it.
---
Weird, I keep getting screwed by greedy bloody melee builds bum rushing and OHKOing legendaries before anyone else can get a shot during events.
---
It's just a terribly designed event. Sometimes it doesn't update to tell you whether or not the location is the source so you can't progress. I mostly stick to the animal ones now since those are quick and easy.
---
Do you still have it? If yes can you take a picture of the effects?
---
see this post was 71% upvote while I was typing this. I understand not upvoting, but downvoting this is simply ridiculous.
---
Well survival mode is gone in large part to people complaining about it including the non PVP crowd which is hilarious. 
---
I said it when it was announced you get rid of survival you are probably going to see more PvP in adventure so there you have it.  
---
For me, I don’t mind and have actually crossed paths with some of the hardcore survival players recently and had fun doing the back and forth PvP but I’m sure people will start screaming from the rooftops to eliminate all PvP from adventure.
---
I normally am one of those one shoters but for public legendary farming events I play differently. Staying out of sneak lowers damage and limb shots help. But uranium fever if there are a lot of players I’ll kill the first mole miner that I see then equip what ever weapon it drops shot everyone a thumbs up and most people get the picture. The supervisors also seem to have a uncanny interest in me and will run past three or four players to attack me. So I tend to kite them around so everyone can get a hit.
---
I’m only good with buffing the .50 receiver. Otherwise it’s an incredibly common weapon that should not become top shelf just because.
---
Hazmat wearing berserker melee here. I do not mess with broken armor. As melee, rads come at you from every direction and rads mean a smaller health bar and a smaller health bar means you die easier. SBQ, ghouls, and glowing things all give rads. Putting on a hazmat unequips armor, if you rely on broken armor you’ll have to repair it to put it on then break it again every time you equip a hazmat suit and that seems like a hassle. For carry weight I just use a high capacity backpack.
---
I have max sneak and agility, I can smack the SBQ in the face and she will never see me. Field Surgeon, Born Survivor, First Aid, Serendipity, Blocker, Ricochet, and Dodgy keep me alive; I don’t really die that often even at Scorched Earth and with those perks I can hold all three pylons at Encryptid. Mutations include: adrenal reaction, speed demon, marsupial, talons, twisted muscles, and carnivore.
---
Sounds like Rose.  Her quest will take you to areas lower level players are not quite ready for.  
---
Back burner it and revisit later.
---
General guide:
---
Stay on the left (Forest) intil L17 or so.  Follow the overseers quest.  
---
Goto Riverside Manor and camp mcclintock.  for a couple other quests
---
Go N to the Toxic valley about L20. Go to Wavy Willards for a quest.
---
 Around 30, head S to the ash heap and pick up the excavator quest
---
At 40, explore the middle of the map (savage divide).  you will be much better prepared for the remainder of Roses quest.  See her for rewards after L50.
---
At 45, go east to the Mire and Bog.
---
If I uninstall it’s for good. I’ve grinder 3 builds now and if I loose them I’m move big on. Been here since day one and I love the game but I’m hitting my limit with this crap.
---
I heard they realised it was broken so they switched to a 25% discount while they try to fix it.
---
😉
---
So far you're winning for best psn out of the dozen or so I've collected
---
I like your honesty, upvote for that.
---
Where can I get a plan for the fixer??
---
Is it considered like a pistol? I was thinking it could trigger Gun Runner to max base speed while traveling.
---
Understandable mate
---
&gt;It's at least obvious they've been tinkering with the script up to the sale, which pretty much says eveything
---
I'm adjusting my tinfoil hat; it's obvious they've been tinkering with the script that is supposed to hand out random effects. You know, Random ran = new Random(). It's not that hard, if you want it to be truly RANDOM.
---
I think its on a mule somewhere but im not sure, i had this picture of a different one (executioners 1 star) that also doesnt irradiate you and is missing that text though
---
https://imgur.com/a/gzAkYLT
---
Any good spots for scorched spawns? I know a lot of places they spawn but none seem that great.
---
I believe those have been there for quite a long time (though I can't speak to individual positions, I haven't been keeping track).  Either most of them are 'open positions' that they need to fill repeatedly over time, or they're having a hell of a hard time finding people that meet the requirements.
---
Honestly, I'd be surprised if they actually have the funding to hire all those new people, but that's pure speculation.
---
i think we had like 8 people in the same world last night,  private server here we come
---
I actually think its pretty underrated. Probably.
---
With Ghoulish and some way to regen Rad Damage, like Sunkissed or Pharmacist, using a Vampiric Assaultron Head you can, very likely, be borderline unkillable.
---
Not that its hard to be unkillable in this game, mind, but I think that would be an interesting build to try.
---
It's with an s for sure?
---
I would have thought they just would have went with just scrip meaning both singular and plural like sheep.
---
I laughed harder at this then I should have. Bravo
---
Quite possible really, why you got down voted is more curious?
---
To be fair
---
I absolutely love uranium Fever, I always go into public chat to tell everyone I won’t 1 hit the legendaries if they don’t, and it usually works lol
---
I never really understood how some developers are super incompetent and others get it right the first time
---
spot on. idc how they implement this idea but they need to add professions, do something about events, add a huge cap/resource sink, add mid/high cost SPECIAL reset - give solo players something to do ffs, game offers near zero set content now that the events are random. 
---
WoW was the most populated game for a long time for a reason, they need to learn from it.
---
I asked because I read that mutation chance consider the rad per seconds. But now that I think of it, I got some mutation from a simple ghoul caress lol.
---
Thx :)
---
I have a TSE one and I’m pretty sure it doesn’t irradiate me. Maybe it’s something with the explosive effect that helps cancel it?
---
It's affected by gunslinger, so I assume it would work with Gun Runner.
---
I like my sniper, thanks.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is a good place to hang.
---
Th see are always there. They have been for ages.
---
Are the plans for the fixer still only available from the encryptid event?
---
Two-shot explosive minigun, junkies explosive 50 cal and numerous other fastrker firing guns I've tested after hearing the reports I've fought scorchbeasts and other high health enemies with no issues man.
---
lets assume they are not tinkering; what could be the reason for this from a devs perspective? how could a true RNG code yield these results?
---
not sure about heavy guns, but it works for rifles
---
I love the music that comes from that church. For real there is a note in the church that talks about the organ and the music at night
---
Encryptid is the only quest.
---
Oh no you can like whatever you like I'm just telling you the damage of sniper rifles and single shot weapons aren't as good as automatics
---
No idea then, send a support ticket.
---
Thanks I’m on it.
---
To be honest, the PA strangler is useless since it will freezes your game and everyone in your vicinity.  
---
Now seeing how they dealt with the laser-explosive issue ( the fix was to simply remove them lol), I doubt the PA strangler will be fixed anysoon.
---
I had two Scorch Beast Queens not drop any fucking loot.
---
 So stop playing?
---
That's legacy, the original versions were bugged and didn't have the irradiate user effect.
---
I guess yours is actually double legacy because its an explosive one that doesn't irradiate lol. Does it just fire a pellet like \*pop\* after you charge it? Man that would be underwhelming, the best part of the gun is the huge laser and the sound effect.
---
The vendor just needs to be the one limited in daily sales and not have the players limited by how much they can scrip daily. This doesn't make me play more, it makes me log in, scrip my crap legendaries, play for maybe an hour and log back off. Until wastelanders, legendary farming is really the only thing going for me with this game. Have the legendary vendor scrip cap at what other vendors are for their caps (1400) and have the player scrip cap double what we have now.
---
That’s not and will never be the point.. I don’t wanna be forced to stop playing a game I’ve invested a lot of time/ money Into.. I want Bethesda to fix their shitty product..
---
I got downvoted because we must’ve talk shit about the fabled EA.. I mean Bethesda.. they’re perfect remember!! 🤷‍♂️
---
Yup it's in the patch notes
---
It charges up so the whole head is emblazoned in a Laser and it shoots out multiple explosive shots. It’s fun to use though
---
well you dont actually have the launch codes. You are either getting launch cards, or pieces of the code which then need to be deciphered into the code. You are far away from the launch code (technically.) You can get the code easily today if you dont want to manually break it.
---
Is it though? Fallout 4 was Bethesda’s most sold game within a 6 month time frame. Now overall it might be Skyrim, but I believe Fo4 surpassed it. I’m going to look and report back.
---
Now with the max carry backpack I can carry just as much without my power armor as with, with the exception of my excavator suit. That still has the extra amount, and with the logging bug that much more :)
---
I have 118 unused perk cards on my main. Just collecting dust
---
Rolled all my scrip on that broken garbage, 20 minutes later my buddy pulls a bloodied explosive minigun for 25% off.
---
i use weight reduction armor with deep pocket mods. also use marsupial and a few other mutations 
---
my inventory is usually around 160 lbs out of a 395 lb carry weight 
---
i carry 2 handmade and a  subgun 
---
10 stimpack  ( i use healing factor so I don't need more)
---
a few diluted rad aways 
---
20 water ( you can find extra at player camps)
---
5-6 ribeyes
---
ammo ( with bandoleer i can carry tons of ammo)
---
armor 
---
any junk i pick up along the way 
---
X01 power armor for high rad areas 
---
a few fusion cores 
---
standard backpack 
---
armor is all vanguard as my build is high health so im at 529 protection for ballistic and energy  without PA
---

I love it, it's basically endgame for me to trick it into doing what I want, here's my current humble abode:

Why would it matter if people "suspected it was me"?

Idk man. You're an anomaly then.
---
No, Grafton Day is way too short.
---
?
---
Not if you do it the way mentioned above, doorways happily face each direction, just have to maneuvre back and forth a bit.
---
You were saying?
---
That's who I have handmades also :)
---
Alright here’s my findings: Skyrim has sold over 30 million copies by 2016, Fo4 shipped 12 million on its opening day, equating to 750million dollars on opening day. Holy shit didn’t realize that!
---
“Ah, day 28. This picture is of my game crashing for the 5th time in a session.” Lol
---
Bethesda did not discover this for themselves. 
---
They only realised it was broken from reddit comments and support tickets yesterday, where myself and others called out that we were only getting LD with agi or WR.
---
HRockit 
---
I play with several characters though and really only my main's CAMP is up to snuff right now.
---
Gamma Guns serve the same purpose and, by default, are lighter.  It doesn't use rounds as common as Fusion Cells, but you don't have to deal with the wonky reloading mechanism in the middle of a battle either.
---
You know I do find myself playing less since this daily cap was added.
---
LIBERTY PRIME ONLINE.
---
Can't see how anyone would pay good money for this game and then defend Bugthesda for giving them a crap product... but they do !!!!
---
I crafted more than 5 health items,  but the counter is stuck at 4
---
We care!  
---
You should start a new rock band now, "Smashing Pixels"
---
I don’t get god rolls but since I changed how I buy from her, they are much better. I don’t run bloodied but I have a full set of crappy unyielding armor. I run down to the lake by her, get my health below 20%. Apply my armor and use anything that will get my charisma and luck up. I’m usually at 22/23 and then I buy. I get much better rolls than I used to.  Good luck!
---
My use of quotes, in no way, was attempting to quote anything you said. Exaggeration is commonly used to illustrate a point, I prefer "fucking" to "literally". Intentionally taking things out of context is surely an intelligent persons rhetoric...
---
I want one that mocks the robot on robocop that say "You have 10 seconds to comply"
---
You'll want high strength and use the swing speed perks - martial artist &amp; gladiator.
---
Glow sight (bonus damage against glowing enemies) helps in nuke zones, especially against a mob like the WS golf clubhouse.  
---
Bloody mess &amp; tenderizer are also good choices (IMHO)
---
Since you will be up close and personal, vampire weapons will help keep your health up, and healing factor mutation will take care of restoring health after the fight is over.
---
Fireproof will help against SB gas attacks.
---
Gamma Guns are an option as well.
---
"...and I'm all out of gum." 
---
I said this to myself many times the day we had the daily challenge to chew gum. I never did find enough to get those 10 atoms.
---
One thing I say to everyone who uses carry weight perks. 
---
Only use them when you become over encumbered. Instead of having it passively. You are missing out on some heavy damage and Dr by using them when it’s not needed.
---
There's only the one set of voice lines. It's based on the Liberty Prime robot in fallouts 3 and 4. You dont control what it says or when
---
This is why I hate those people who complain about us complaining when we are reporting bugs. Shit's not getting fixed otherwise.
---
If you find a Quad, and have the time to sit there and power it up, you can easily get 3000 out of it.  Coupled with a sneak attack, Covert Operative, and a VATS critical... everything short of an SBQ melts.
---
But that's the key - if you have the luck and the time.  Most Assaultron heads aren't that remarkable, and all of them are, by default, inordinately heavy for being novelty weapons.
---
I cheated to a home in Skyrim my second go.
---
Was this at white springs on ps4? I was there too, I made a post on here about it I also contacted bethesda.
---
More people giving the queen more damage resistance was a major one for me. That was until someone pointed out she has 32k health and has an unchanging amount of armor
---
Have you thought that maybe it’s skewed purposefully towards dropping us crap?
---
A non Atom addition would be refreshing.
---
Me too... best part of 3450 scrip on my 3 characters and a third of that is now melee scrip.
---
Yet consoles still have cheaters in them? You call it a "master race"? All of them are equal.
---
Oh wow. Didn’t realize would work! Thanks!!
---
No other game has caused me to what the fuck more.
---
As a public event it’s a 💩 show
---
No way. I if I have a plan the parts, and perks (if needed), I should be able to craft whatever I choose.
---
I don't want to have to hope other players are crafting what I want,  willing to sell it, and at a fair price.
---
The thing that I don't understand is why it takes them a whole patch cycle to change a timer from 40 minutes to 20.  Maybe you could excuse this last November, but this is a *new* system, written just for this game, and it apparently never occurred to anyone that they may need to tweak it?
---
Siege having crossplay seems like it will be extremely unfair
---
Going with the poster of the hanlons razor comment on this topic...
---
Pml ! Me too!!
---
Noooo, i just used my last 100 script on a useless weapon :(
---
Let's go to grind again :D
---
Damn
---
it was just a joke man, don't take it to heart
---
Thank you lol
---
F
---
Nothing really we can do, j was the first one there and the guy ghosted soon as I got close. I sent a video though to bethesda. At least they know it's being done.
---
lol taking things out of context. You used quotation marks, they have one purpose: to QUOTE people. 
---
And you acknowledge that you used exaggeration, which means you acknowledge you don't think accuracy is useful here. Exaggeration is a form of lying, and lying is not useful to 'illustrate a point.'
---
You're just an idiot. Byebye blocked.
---
Not surprising. I'm not retracting my point, though.
---
I buyed the plan from a player in his vendor machine. But the chance for this is like 1:1000000 -.-
---
I love lamp
---
Thank you kindly! I will finish up with it today! My psn is v01df1sh!
---
I think its also that emoji thing related.Because in NW i have seen my team mates skating around showing thumbs up
---
Missile launchers and fatmans are useless
---
I know man, nowadays I'm trying to play the game but map is literally nearly empty for me almost always, I never hopped servers until this event but now I feel like I have to hop just because Feed the People or Tea Time showed up - two examples that yield NOTHING of value to me - and hopping is a waste of time and is really frustrating. The Messenger is always up, which is the buggiest quest of all time etc. 
---
I understand they might be adjusting in game economy as too many easy access events may cause an inflation of caps/items/good 3\* equipment but COME THE FUCK ON man 2-3 weeks should be enough for something like that ffs. Isnt it just a simple code change after all?
---
I did the scorched black powder one yesterday, which was actually a ton of fun one-shotting pretty high level scorched. But I can imagine it would be incredibly tedious doing a thousand or so.
---
As well as “random rng system”
---
My bad. I confused the daily challenge to kill anglers with this one. Still have to find scorched creatures to kill.
---
meat hook: hold my beer...
---
I'm having trouble with the silo.
---
Not between consoles. They obviously arent going to pit pc and console players against eachother

At least their customers will be happy

Nothing really, just trying to don't make you look bad
---
That could be the cause, yes, but I don't remember them emoting every time I saw this behaviour.
---
Dense chest + fireproof 3\*
---
Don't forget to use chems on crazy strong enemies.
---
When I see multiple scorch beasts or a glowing cryptid, the first thing I do is pop a Med X.
---
It would be nice if Camp Fire Tails popped more.
---
Confirmed. It's actually quite a hard hitter with sneak/vats/pistol build. And you run faster too. Just gotta manage those 15 agility points well.
---
Interesting idea. If u choose to go ahead with this then i wish u luck👍
---
Bethesda marked you to the ignore category.
---
...and he only played the game 12 times.
---
Gonna say action hero.  AA is nice but FFR is a flat damage increase.  Reload I believe is cancelled out by speed demon so that’s a wash.  Also your other two mods are vats related so I’d argue you essentially have a 1* vs a 3* with frankly 3 good modifiers.
---
Triple check, let me know if I'm wrong (not being sarcastic). I looked it up cuz I had the same expectation. English is a stupid language, haha.
---
Great read. Can't wait for the sequel.
---
Either you say something positive about Fallout 76 or you get out is the jest of this sub. Gave my upvote but now its 74%.
---
I love UF. It's fine with anything up to 6 people. They need to tweak how many enemies spawn, though. There are a lot of times where we're all just sitting around waiting. Meanwhile, running it solo, I've had 5-6 enemies spawn every 30 seconds or so.
---
stealth bonus and faster movement while aiming, plus the three stars

I can't think of a proper reason for a man like you to defend such trash. Universally everyone suspects/*knows* he's cheating.

The only reason I could think of was the fact that you were "friends" with him, and that's why you blindly defend him.

The first line, near-universally, means that whatever you're defending, usually is *questionable* at best.

And for the 1,000,000th time if you don’t wanna engage in combat you shouldn’t be forced to or otherwise what’s the point of trying to claim the workshop if they are just doing it to be annoying ? If they wanna pvp they can server hop to another server and find someone else to play along with but for fucks sake don’t force me to engage in pvp if I just want to take over the shop to farm and I do realize that that purpose of the workshop is also so other players can raid you I understand that I have no problem with that but when you have someone griefing you or just being annoying to pleasure themselves then that’s not actual pvp . Actual pvp is when both parties mutually accept combat. And if the simple solution is to just server hop to get away from griefers then why shouldn’t the simple solution to find someone who wants to pvp be the same as just trying to play the game without constant griefing?  Just server hop or go somewhere else instead of continuously  annoying someone but don’t make players who obviously don’t want to engage in combat with you. I’m complaining im simply just calling out the people who use pvp as an excuse to grief someone. When you want actual pvp both parties have to atleast agree to it otherwise how is it pvp? That way you get your pleasant pvp instead of killing someone over and over and then wondering why they are complaining about griefing. I’m not saying you do this either so before you go saying that I’m saying everyone from survival mode is a griefer please read the text above^ 
---
That’s all man don’t mean to be rude or nothing just my view on this post.
---
It seems really important to you to feel intellectually superior. Quotes are used for several different reasons, as I used them to keynote different words. Exaggeration is not lying, it's emphatically necessary in some instances. Telling me what I think as part of some slippery slope of related suppositions is significantly more inaccurate. Thanks for blocking me, you don't seem to be interested in a meaningful discussion.
---
I'm going with action hero
---
Bethesda gave you a free event known as Meat Week so how dare you speak badly about your lord and savior!!!
---
Once you try a Bloodied weapon at nerd rage health, you won’t mind dying as much. My main is a sentinel build, but my two alts are both Bloodied commando builds. They are very OP.
---
I decided not gonna log in that day, because I knew that there was probably gonna be an issue. Like come on guys, u cant expect beth at this point to release something thats not broken. Saving up the scrip for the 50% sale it is.
---
I don't even bother with horde events for that reason. They just are not worth the time and resources.
---
I know they gave us 'meek week'  ;)
---
Best thing about it is Grahm's commentary...
---
Oh I love those, I get so excited not seeing loot load after waiting 20mins at corpse after spending 400+ rounds that I just turn the game off for the rest of the day.
---
Just no!
---
They stated sometime in Q1 of 2020 and its not in stone so odds are high it would be pushed back.
---
Wow. I was proud of my camp.... not anymore.
---
I never really noticed it on my other two characters, but my guy with chameleon mutation has this happen all the time. Maybe it's unrelated to chameleon effect flickering the screen often. I'll have to pay more attention lol
---
Action Hero is better. Vats perks on high rate of fire heavy weapons aren't that useful. The damage outweighs the extra pen from the AA and faster reload is nice for the tanky enemies.
---
I think the top of Seneca rocks will always be my favorite. Its rough to build up there and teleporting in can get you killed, but damn does that view make it all worth it. A couple lil bonuses are its centrally located so you alway have a free shortcut, and your higher than the scortchbeasts.
---
What they need to do is remove the time limit. This has never been a good design choice in any game. Even Destiny 2 ended up removing their nightfall time limits.
---
It's definitely bugged. If you've managed to complete it I'd love to see a screenshot of which one worked for you. I suspect you're full of it though.
---
Great use of that tunnel mate, looks like a genuine location and not just another camp. Wicked stuff.
---
Reminds me of that time when I ran out of ammo and had to take out one Toxic(?) sheepscuatch with a chainsaw...
---
Make a list for everyone to use, so when you pop in you have to jump servers 20 times to play!
---
Thanks, but no thanks!
---
I wish they would add the pipboy light color change option from 4 along with it.
---
The first thing I did when leaving the vault was look for the option, only to find it missing.
---
I find it weird that I can build power armor or a laser rifle, but can't change a light.
---
Huh, interesting, but this only applies to situations involving bots from what I understand, so I don't think this is relevant here. For example yesterday's bug revelation post is at I believe 97% upvotes now. r/fo76 is a highly controversial sub for with jackasses from either side a) constantly ripping on everything about the game and b) constantly defending everything about the game. I like to think this ratio is organic and this 20% downvoting lads belong to the latter category.
---
Gamna guns do work but I think it damages your armor.
---
The roll is RNG but the choices it picks from are not. Consider a 6-sided dice but only 2 sides have anything on them. For any random drop there is a list of items that can drop. If there are 6 items on the list, it rolls a 1-6 and gives that one. The list for the mystery pick was copied from the list that the creatures use to drop...only they made the copy back before they fixed the drop issue on the creatures and never made the fix in this list. They have acknowledged that it was a mistake but it will take a client side patch to fix as the problem is in the ESM. 
---
Now, one way they do tinker with the odds is that the lists are not a simple list. They can be nested and objects/effects can be listed multiple times. So, your first roll might have 3 items and 1 list. If you land on the list, it rolls again for the items on that list. Consider meat week. It rolled between a plan list (flag, meat cleaver), an apparel list (grillmaster hat, bloodied chef outfit, bloodied hat), a weapon list (Tenderizer, shishkebob plan, flamer plan), and a mod list (the 3 tenderizer mods and the tato salad recipe for some reason). Once it landed on the list, it rolled again to see which item you got. It also did a roll to see if you got a legendary armor piece. If you did, then it rolled a list of 1\* armor pieces and the armor type was based on a leveled list that was appropriate to your character's level. Then there was another roll that determined if you got the firework mine or not. It was set with an 85% chance to not drop. (all this info is only applicable if you completed the event at 100%. Lower percentages had fewer items in the loot pool)
---
So as you see, it is RNG, but there are a lot more pieces to it than that. Some of the leveled lists are very complex and have items repeated multiple times. For example, the list that contains the ultra-rare plasma grenade plan has so many items on it and repeated items that it makes those plan exceedingly rare.
---
As long as PC isn't involved, go nuts. I don't want to deal with the youths.
---
Easily the action hero! Two shot is a 20% damage boost and fire rate obviously dies and extra 25% damage. The other one has Anti Armor, which is good, but “only” roughly 28% added damage, I’ve been told. Vats doesn’t work very well on this gun as it consumes way too much action points, thus the two vats related perks are next to useless. 
---
On a different gun, say a Handmade which excels in vats, I would have preferred the other. Two shot fucks up vats accuracy. It’s not a problem when aiming down sights, like you do with a .50 cal, but on a rifle or pistol it’s really not a good option. 
---
Long answer. I’d say keep the action hero and have fun. Scrip the other one.
---
Since they’ve been up for a long time, they might just be using them to test the job market: see what kind of candidates are out there, what salary they are looking for, etc.
---
The random rng is a new development in rng. Its the randomist of random number generation.
---
Interesting. I hadn’t heard the bottle cap mines were duplicating.  Just that they gave caps.
---
Every now and then you just see a camp that stands out from the rest.... mine isn't one of them.
---
Same with the legendary module thing... Wasted 50 scrip on a useless module that aint even a legendary effect...
---
holy shit amazing post man, thank you for spending your time to draft this up!
---
Maybe a new dlc for those stupid kids shoes with wheels in them 😂. There are several bugs that can cause it. There is/was one with power armor stations where you could glide around crouched in that position.
---
Thanks.
---
I feel like it fails due to some modifiers actually being more rare than others.
---
The action hero, AA doesn't stack with stabilized perk very well.
---
Also if you prime the action hero, you've got an incredible SBQ weapon.
---
I'd say I can count on one hand the number of times I've been disconnected from NW. Given that we're not all experiencing the same thing, perhaps there's something with your location or network configuration that's causing the issue?
---
Blatant hackers get no ban, and I get a 72 hour ban for saying a bad word.
---
Yeah level one stuff lol, but it's a decent way to get a instigating pipe rifle or hunting rifle, most other weapons aren't available til level 5
---
That was clearly sarcasm
---
Every time I start up the game that's the first thing I hear. Regardless of where I am. Does that happen to you? I'm hoping it's a bug they can fix asap.
---
I'll probably start judging camps in about 4 or 5 days, so you got some time.
---
Rock on. Mind sharing a bit more on you build and gear? Looks like a puncher.. dcg or something similar. I can back track and figure out luck, can probably guess agility ...
---
What do you run in endurance? I'm leaning towards fireproof, sun kissed, rejuvenated.
---

---
This guy gets it
---
Simple answer to this: deadlines. Some developers take time to test before release, others however put a baby behind the wheel of a running semi and say good to go.
---
I've played campfire tales and path to enlightenment during the day many times.
---
At this point I'd have more faith in a baby in a semi truck than bethesda releasing patches
---
\- Stealth improvement is hard to test, and bloodied build wont need it
---
\- movement speed currently dont show on pip-boy and I can't feel it
---
\- Damage per bullet is 8-9% higher, however stinging magzine on Fixer is 25 rounds and handmade has 35 rounds = every 175 shots fixer will need to reload twice more
---
I see where you are coming from but what new player needs to rely on others?  I am a solo player and have taken multiple characters past level 50 on my own
---
Hard disagree.
---
Getting the best armor in the game SHOULD be challenging. The fact that you are unable to communicate with other people in order to make a team shouldn't change this.
---
Make a post on reddit to find a team, and you'll have a Raid grind team in no time.
---
Besides, dead in the water and meltdown can easily be duo'd on novice and standard. If you're unable to duo them; improve your build and try again later.
---
Heavy weapons.
---
Damn right.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Uranium Fever is definitely way too cramped. I like the idea of Grafton Day being expanded and more challenging. Good idea.
---
Ignoring 50% armor on its own is equivalent to about 29% higher actual damage dealt, unless the target has low DR (which usually means they are weak and get killed easily anyway). Not sure how this stacks with other armor penetration effects, though. The Action Hero definitely has the better DPS, the one disadvantage is the worse accuracy.
---
See, and I've been told she has 75k health. I don't know what to believe anymore.
---
They just need to remove the time limit. It's a bad mechanic in this case especially when the servers suck. Make the fighting even harder if they have to but the time limit should go.
---
To Be Faaiirrr ✊
---
This ☝🏾
---
“At some point” even the most basic alphas or even betas have test servers running. This far into the experiment that is 76 not having this is laughable.
---
I am pretty sure it is 32k, my aae handmade does 18 damage to the sbq head 18*35 is 630 and I can definitely see her health going down from my shots so I can for sure say it's not 75k
---
You bet! All the answers to most questions are in the ESM somewhere. It's just knowing what questions to ask and then digging until you find the answer. For whatever reason we didn't go digging for the meat week mechanics until Wednesday afternoon and learned a lot of stuff about how much credit you get for the different activities. I wish we had looked into it sooner as it could have helped a lot of people be more successful at the event. And there are still some things we don't know. Yesterday we were looking at a stat on enemies that we can't figure out what it correlates to. It might be something useful but there is no info as to what it is or does. So things aren't always straightforward.
---
Best I can think of is to have a few on hand, like a BP pistol with a dragon and maybe a third BP rifle. Fire, switch, fire, switch, fire, then reload, reload, reload while on your way to the next target.
---
Get your hands on a QE version with the flechette mod and it’s like how shotguns used to be
---
Yeah, got a junky. Looking for another challenge :)
---
I thought we were always supposed to be over encumbered 😂.
---
I'm op and save more ammo going semi-auto
---
No, neither should be public events. This whole thing has been a failed experiment. Grafton day literally takes 5 seconds to complete.
---
Nice. Do you use shotgunner perks with it?
---
Heavy weapons and I believe demolition expert helps with the explosive component
---
Really? You went in like 4 posts saying that.
---
Hanging with the boys in the wastelands the other day...
---
I got a good thing but why should i get mad when i got a good Thing, some Times you got to be happy with what you got
---
How does that solve the space issue? It's impossible to even tell wtf is going on when there are 5 or more people in there.
---
Not on board with "make the game easier" requests
---
Decent chance that was a bullshit ban. The Wanderer made a video of him crafting 100,000 ultracite ammo in a two week span so it's definitely doable.
---
Do you use the sneak damage perk? When I crouch, my AA/FFR handmade does 47 to the head. As long as she's not directly aggro'd to me, I get consistent sneak bonuses.
---
Thanks I’ll swap it over to my heavy character. And yeah demolition expert definitely helps. Swapping in my lvl 2 card boosted it by close to 200 damage
---
ignorance is bliss
---
I don't sneak, hurts my characters back. But yeah 32k health seems about right
---
I only fire full auto on Scorchbeasts and enemies like that, I can one shot super mutant warlords with my combat rifle shooting 38 ammo which is my main weapon. I save 556 for proper fights.
---
Team mates can travel for free to you and your camp but not to your workshops.
---
I would use a sign and small letters to let people know. Then, when they shop at your vendor they will know that you provide this other service if interested.
---
Definitely Action Hero. VATS perks on rapid fire heavies are not helpful. About the only drawback is Action Hero won't be as accurate at range but the stabilized perk in PA solves both your accuracy and armor penetration issues.
---
Did I miss it, or were there no bloodies out of the whole lot?
---
I've seen that glitch before where they float and there is no foot animation but it has only lasted a few seconds then it renders properly
---
I admire your positive outlook :) bravo 👏
---
Lucky hole mine gang
---
Where is The Action Hero found?
---
As far as I am aware tenderizer doesn't work. I wouldn't run strong back as you get better reduction per point with the specialized reduction perks. Pack rat should be a more situational card. Scrap and stash as often as possible so the points can be better spent on blocker or something more beneficial.
---
To be honest i we focused on fixers and didn’t even notice that 🤔
---
Player skating is something new on Xbox as well. I've been seeing it a lot since the last patch.
---
lol I like you. I believe you on the health. Wish we could turn health numbers on or something so we didn't have to guess.
---
FO4 was the same way.
---
Two: This one and another.
---
400 rounds?  How about 2K rounds.
---
Man I'm still looking for a dragon. I know Grahm sells them but never saw them during Meat Weeks.
---
Also, what are the breakpoints of low-DR to get 50%?
---
Does the +1 from a backpack drop 5%? What about DR from a base outfit / vault suit?
---
I didnt see a mystery pick i just saw lower prices.  Any reason why?
---
Yes yes yes yes, this should have been implemented in the beginning of the game
---
Nope it’s still heavy gun perks
---
The 3 people that work at the austin division must be going crazy. Including the janitor-
---
I thought it did. I know I can get 1000 damage on my harpoon when I get all the perks lined up. It’s a fun weapon just slow on the loading.
---
Sweet. Thank you.
---
Same thing for me. It’s just not worth the time/caps because of how easy it is. It’s just a boring inconvenience. Last time I did it, it probably took under 5 minutes with most of that finding a shovel and travelling. I think the only enemies I encountered were two level 1 mole rats
---
Sounds like your prices are very fair.  I try to keep my prices low too because I'm in the forest and I want low level players to be able to access health items for cheap.
---
Last night I got a 3* beserkers explosive hunting rifle and it’s making me consider making a beserkers sniper style build of it would even be possible..
---
can confirm.  I've seen those last week as well
---
If we found an AAE handmade at 5k we would snap it up because the fiance REEEEEEEEAAAAAALLLLLLY wants an AAE weapon
---
Max rank first aid, field surgeon and born survivor. You will rarely ever die. Use blocker serendipity dodgy for extra survival. Get addicted to med x and psycho for -20dr then you can where under armor and a backpack and a piece of armor to even you back out. Having a negative DR breaks berserkers and turns it off.
---
Lol I had a level 30 fixer for a while until I was tired of the dead weight because It was only good for 30 and below levels. Pretty pointless for me since I go to higher levels all the time. I sold it knowing somewhere down the line I'll get a higher level of that or plans for it.
---
This stuff doesn't happen to me. Why?
---
That should be a prize on its own 😂
---
It’s doing 1089 on a shotgun build with level 2 demolition expert. I’m curious to see what it does on my Heavy build with level 5 DE
---
Ran and cleared an expert and standard last night little to no issues.
---
Carry weight gang
---
It was a reward for a survival mode challenge. With the mode having been removed on Tuesday, the weapon is no longer available.
---
Make the Grafton monster legendary ;)
---
I am hereby offering FREE practice Raid runs for Playstation 4, on standard difficulty. All you have to do is familiarize yourself with the environment and fix/break a couple of pipes. I'll do the rest.
---
You will see that it is indeed possible to get plans by doing relaxing Standard-difficulty raids.
---
I think it gives you 90dr
---
Always blows my mind when people refuse to sell anything over 10k. Also if any of yall have any explosive laser/plasma weapons I will buy them, if on xbox
---
Don’t whine dude. This game was INTENDED to be play with others. If you play only solo you have to deal with those difficulties. People who grind the content properly shouldn’t be punished by babies wanting the game to be easier.
---
I'm on ps4 in the american NW. Hbu?
---
You missed the mystery pick fiasco... took about 2 or 3 hours for Bugthesda to realise the screw up and they changed it to lower price instead.
---
You can find some real gems in vending. I got a max level regenerating STR FDC urban chest for 999. I do think though that people saying 5k is too much for a top tier are really pushing it though.
---
I'm a bloodied big guns build and I only put on the high capacity pack after farming runs and I'm over encumbered. Otherwise I run with the armored pack, which lets me carry up to 400. The damage resist us OK. With high capacity I can carry 490.
---
There’s a huge difference in your damage resistance between running the two so it really comes down to how you play and want to survive. If you’re running stealth commando like you say and don’t get hit much then high capacity would be better? But you also said you’re bloodied so if you find you get hit and killed a lot the armored one could be better! 
---
The best option is to farm up both then you can have armored and when you’re overweight put the high capacity one on
---
Well thats quite alot,thanx!
---
I would pay atoms to be on the beta test server
---
Don’t forget to add flechette also!  Then get out and kill them scorched!
---
There is no BOS items.. Its. Military Bunker an my Character is a BOS Heavy Gunner is about the best I can do for now.
---
Carry both and use the weight one when you need it.
---
I'm on PC. An this is below Charleston Junkyard.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Like I was telling someone else, a lot of gamers are more than willing to test onliner games for free. It's been standard for persistent online games for decades.
---
First of all, this is a bad idea. This game is too easy already as it is, pretty much everything is soloable, even the nuke silos which at some point were supposed to be "end game" can be blasted through in 12 minutes without any effort by a solo player. Vault 94 is the end game content everyone was asking for and it is very reasonable for it to be hard - level 95-100 mobs, limited time frame to add pressure and some tactical moves make up for that reward which is the best armor in the game if the full set is equipped (granted you have nice legendary effects on it). The same logic applies in other MMO'S where you need a 10-20 people raid to get one of the best gear in the game.
---
Second of all, I have seen dozens of discord groups, posts on forums, voice chat groups of people who are always looking for group to raid. Its not that hard to just team up with someone and learn the raid together, since good communications and tactics is the key to success. Hell, I even get occasional invites to team from random people near vault94 when I roam around in Adventure mode. And lastly, you dont even need a full team to do a raid - every mission on Standart is easily done by 2 people, which is enough to get the plans. We farm all missions on Expert as a party of 3 and at the very start we sucked aswell but we learned together and got better so don't give up. This game lacked some sense of accomplishment and in my opinion vault raids compensate for that very nicely.
---
I find prices in vending machines really up and down, one day you’re finding a great weapon or armor piece for 1k, the next machine someone’s selling a 1* two shot shotgun for 10k
---
I killed several during the queen event and nada.:(
---
If he use power armor and stabilized perk, the AA is better for sure!
---
I don’t take workshops to harass or annoy.  Maybe I want to replenish my fusion cores or other materials?  
---
In that example, why should someone else be allowed squatters rights without any recourse? 
---
There is no rule that says you need to engage in PvP when someone claims your workshop.   I have taken plenty of them and had mine claimed many times without killing or being killed.  But there is that possibility!   Those are the rules.  
---
Personally, a little tension and anxiety is needed in this game because it can be pretty goddamn boring otherwise.  That’s what survival mode provided until enough people complained and it got nerfed and then eliminated. 
---
So now people want to PvP more in adventure and this is a surprise to folks?   Give me a break.  You got exactly what you wanted but with unintended consequences. 
---
Had they just left survival alone and catered more to those that enjoyed PvP we wouldn’t be having this discussion.
---
You need to kill shit a scortchbeast has turned into a scorched.
---
I bet it's Valseek. Lol.
---
Yeh both is best offcourse but it takes a while to farm,i have 7 badges now so was wondering what to get first.thanx for ur input!
---
give up with the big ambitious ideas for this game.
---
I have but everyone was a consummate pro. Would signal people to the legendary, only do a couple of hits, wait for everyone to get hits in, then wipe out enemies. Definitely the exception though.
---
I thought the Fixer was a unique weapon.
---
The first one I got was high capacity because I was always running close to over encumbered. If you find you’re rarely over-encumbered then the extra armor is better
---
Not only that but higher levels (like level 400s) stealing my loot when I die during the SBQ shouldn't be as disheartening as it is.
---
disappointing, was the only mode I played. One of the few survival games where you weren't always trolled by jerks. But was fun never knowing what was going to happen if you ran into someone.
---
Yeh eventualy i will get both but have 7 badges now and wanted to choose the first one
---
It's a random event.  You can't start it.
---
Like, I'm sorry but maybe "casual players" shouldn't get the best loot in the game... If you want the best loot in the game maybe you should play more...
---
😢
---
I'd pay for some gossip on what the hell is really going on inside that company with this game.
---
Yeah I know should of said I was looking for it .
---
why anyone sells legendarys is beyond me.  like you said, caps are easy enough to come by, scrip is not, I scrip every unwanted legendary, even if it's a decent roll, because scrip is worth more to me than caps
---
Yeh im a big hoarder lol,but i have 410 carryweight when 20% hp so il take the armor one first i gues.
---
Exactly lol. If you want everything handed to you go play a lego game or something.
---
I feel there should be player made factions, but to make it work better you'd need a bigger population on a server, and server permanence. As in you are assigned to a server, and that's your home, your structures remain loaded even if you are not on, and the workshops can only be claimed by factions and a faction can only hold a number of workshops equal to the members in a faction.
---
Inactive players &amp; factions (30 days inactivity?) have their structures marked as unowned and salvageable to other players (stuff in Stash boxes is safe) and that player space on the server is open to new players.
---
Ingame text chat also required.
---
Better?
---
Considering people sell shit for 5-100$ on Ebay I'd say their really missing out.
---
Awest story and awesome kill!
---
Same here!
---
I don’t play Fallout 76 on my PlayStation 4 PRO, but I did recently switch from an Xbox One X to an old base model Xbox One after having played on my Xbox X since the B.E.T.A.
---
The game on my old Xbox has massive lag spikes anytime it has to load in textures, lag spikes when opening the map, lag when opening the Pipboy, lag when new Public Events start, lag when switching to weapons on my weapon wheel, and lag when switching to a weapon that has a weapon skin on it. We’re talking a good 5 second long freeze for each of these as well. 
---
So for me it’s the opposite. I had noticeably better performance on my Xbox One X as compared to my old base mode Xbox One. On my Xbox One X it had lag spikes in the Pipboy, Map, and loading into a new cell, but the random and constant hitches were not present. 
---
Honestly, this game feels half broken on older consoles. It wasn’t like this at launch. The last few patches have made things considerably worse for me performance wise.
---
You don't scrip a godroll, you trade it for bulk caps/5.56/other godrolls until you find godrolls that fit your build/playstyle.
---
I don't believe for one second that you would scrip an genuine godroll.
---
I saw a guy getting negative votes for asking if we’d get compensated. I sent a ticket to support, hopefully they can fix this. What a waste of scrip, I would have just gotten 25% percent off 3 star ranged weapons if I had the choice when I spent mine, but I ended up wasting characters worth of scrip  on that bugged mystery box, so in effect, Bethesda is punishing me for assuming their game would work properly. There’s something wrong with this company, this is shit that would take minutes to test, I worked FQA at a game studio, it isn’t hard...
---
What are the lit up pieces?  Looks cool
---
Update: As of last night, I've finished a list of Fiber Optics locations, just need to format and check one or two places again.
---
The overall state of the game is not improving, despite the few new additions (Purveyor, Player Vending, Vault Raids). The servers are laggy, there are only few QOL improvements and the game needs serious optimization because the frame rate is really bad. Few wasted scrip is not my main concern, although it is annoying.
---
The challenge of the raid and any other activity in Fallout 76 is “how to play through the lag”. Normally I would disagree with this post because I like having to overcome challenges for greater rewards, but the raids are so unplayable due to how poorly the game runs. So, I agree. Just throw all of the rewards in novice mode until the game runs well, which I’ve lost all hope of that ever happening.
---
PC here and it happens to.  It doesn't reappear until I quit to main menu and join a new server
---
If you look at the Clean Up Appalachia page.  The 50% sale is if we make the stretch goal in killing scorched.
---
Way back when they first announced at some point we would get player vending, a friend and i went a bit overboard and made 2 mules and kept EVERY legendary, crap or not, to sell one day as we had no clue what it would be like or what the market would be.. so i loaded up the 2 mules with all the weapon/armor/food/chems perks for lowering weight, got all armor pieces with weapon or ammo reducing perks, and i had like hundred sof legendarie son each character lol
---
eventually we realized most of them were useless and i am still scripping those to this day lol
---
but i still have a huge amount of great stuff for sale on every character i play with, its fun to be amerchant for me, its my end game!
---
i wouldn’t want this, the amount of people who do standard and expert on xbox is insanely small, there’s about 16 people i know that do the raids and i’m not seeing any lfg post on xbox looking for players to do raids on standard and expert, this will just leave those two difficulties out of the picture entirely.
---
I wish the Grafton Monster was level 200. One-shotting it is just so boring.
---
Cool. Better just saving it then?
---
yeah that is the craziest thing!
---
Just no lol
---
I’ve seen a bunch of wolves doing it.
---
Since the random melee roll was broken they replaced it with the 25% sale. We haven’t reached the benchmark for the 50% just yet. That won’t hit until mid this month.
---
If you haven't worked in a multi-location corporation, it's hard to understand how things...worK?  Work is such an inaccurate word though...
---
I worked for a company that made *billions* of dollars, on a program that sold billions of dollars of product, at a location where the end product rolled out to the customer.  If we wanted to hire a secretary (they still called them that back then), we had to get the *entire corporation* to give us permission.  They usually set a specific budget for personnel, and that was determined at a level far above the site or even the product level.  If we were successful and needed more help, we had to *ask permission* to get more money to hire people - we didn't have the ability to just take the profit from *our* product and sink it back into the local funding.  The money that our product (and again, we're talking *billions* of dollars) didn't actually belong to *us*, it belonged to the mother ship.
---
BGS Austin may be bringing in loads of cash, but they don't get to spent it however they feel like.  They inevitably need permission fro Zenimax to do...well, most things related to money.
---
(All this is speculation and experience with big companies *in general*, not specific knowledge of BGS or even game companies in general, so take it with a very large grain of salt)
---
The best CAMP’s are the most versatile for any area to where you can drop it wherever you need it.  I’m currently working on making a mobile CAMP where everything I need fits inside the Bungalow Camp Trailer.  It’ll be a micro-build.  But currently I’m operating the highest-elevated Slocum Joe’s in Appalachia at Seneca Rocks.  Try out Omelettes!
---
I believe those are stacked bear rugs.
---
Well I can still save about another 1k scrip with the space on my characters combined. Think imma keep hold of it til then. 
---
If we can kill not far off a million scorchbeast, weve got this ha
---
Look at Captainoob’s latest videos. A BE Fixer is 30 more damage than a BE handmade at nerd rage health.
---
the problem is the amount of particles it spawns, not the armor itself, someone i know has a full set and 1 bullet creates a massive cloud blocking your screen.
---
that makes sense
---
RTX 2070 gives me 30-70 fps so no, it is not only you and it doesn’t matter if you are on console or PC. The game has incredibly poor optimization across all platforms.
---
Yes.
---
The 40% off, was yesterday for a few minutes. Since then they've been informed of the fucking melee bug, again. They decided they can't/wont fix it in time, so we now have this shit 25%.
---
Wow, would never have thought of that.  I'm always happy when I finish rebuilding my camp and then see all the other creative things and want to start over
---
VATS use on heavy guns is trash.  .50 cal isn't unusable, but it's not great, on something like a mini gun it's worthless.
---
(I haven't tried either with the .25% AP cost, but I can't imagine it's a big improvement)
---
This never happened to me. My sessions normally lasts until I don't really want to play (that's 2-3 hours) without disconnects.
---
 \&gt;&gt; bloodied Faster swing speed +1 strength meat hook 
---
Also known as the God-roll melee drop.
---
I've, never put anything in my Vendor for over 2500, but this is a 5 figure item (Though I'll offer it to my Discord group before putting it in a Vendor for that)
---
Good thought ... I could do Marine or Enclave at 9 DR and a backpack w/ 1 DR and hit zero then balance w/ an addiction. What backpack would you use? Lead lined or standard? Probably not high-capacity as you probably want ER / DR.
---
I hear you on the negative DR, will watch that.
---
Also, any thought
---
When you’re running around with 20% health you are anything but invincible. Also the damage doesn’t go up infinitely it caps at 80%. Which yes is the highest damage output prefix in game. But you have to be basically 1 hittable to the majority of enemies.
---
How about you reimburse players who got punished for thinking your game would work? No one in their right mind would choose a 60 scrip Mystery Box vs a 75 scrip guaranteed 3 star ranged or Melee. For everyone who spent their scrip they saved on the Mystery Box, they are unable to get the new sale, so you're giving the people who were actually effected no compensation, and giving a new, bteer deal to everyone who still has scrip. I was an adamant defender of your game because I've worked in game studios and i understand how hard it can be do iron out bugs, but this is some negligence on the part of testers. Do you have FQA who tests the build before you put it out? I've played for 2 months and I'm already fed up with the state this game is in. Terrible service.
---
If you find the game too easy with it use something else.
---
+/- 20% higher damage than a normal combat rifle (varies a bit depending which receivers you’re comparing)
---
Also higher base damage than a handmade with equal receivers. Same fire rate in full auto makes it overall more powerful than a handemade. Plus it has the built in sneak perk too so it’s very, very strong
---
Underground near twin lakes. I even have 5x industrial water purifiers cranking away at the either that is the underworld. If only I can figure out how to farm...
---
Yeah we can tell.
---
If there was an LFG function in the game, I'd fully agree. But as it is right now, you're punished if you don't have friends that play to team up with. Playing more won't help you if you're stuck being solo for content scaled for high level and multiple players.
---
It'd be really damn nice if Bethesda would get on adding *basic* multiplayer functions to the game like text chat and LFG.
---
I use sneak on bloodied with sneak perks to make my damage better and it's very good. You can even sneak in a queen fight and get that extra damage on her. The movement is kinda nice for me imo
---
You're right.
---
Thanks for being respectful, I didn't get the bloodied legendary perk since now.
---
No other perks should be made viable as well.  Junkies isn’t bad at all just seems rare as hell on weapons.
---
It has that bug where you shoot an enemy and even if it takes their health all the way down they regain health again and you waste so much ammo
---
What are those launchers like? Any TS? I'll take em off your hands.
---
Here’s the build:
---

---
It might not be the most efficient but it works for me. I’ve got a 1* Berserkers DCG and a Berserker’s Meat Hook that are my go to. I’ve picked up a few ranged weapons I swap around with when I have to shoot things out of the sky - mostly a Berserkers Hunting Rifle and a minigun. I’ve found that the boost from berserkers is enough to make them work when I need them without being specced into them. No one wants berserker weapons so they are cheap and easy to get your hands on. 
---
This character runs vault raids like a beast, it’s too bad the rewards are unreadable armor plans. It’s a really fun build.
---
the time limit isn’t a problem as long as you know the layout and are with a good team and find the least laggy server, i play with my group and we first try all difficulty’s of dead in the water.
---
Then why complain
---
How’d you get underground there lol?
---
I'm a solo player, I find the trade sites OP talks of is full of people that don't even play the game, they have 3 accounts each with 5 characters and max caps, it's like a status thing for them or something, most of them are elitist and I just don't deal with them.  other than the vendor or the trade sites how would I trade it?  I'm not holding on to something hoping something better comes along.
---
Cant say I'm surprised there are more bugs... I dont really understand why they would take away half of the discount because of a bug?
---
They fuck up and we get punished for it lol?
---
While I only use it in certain situations, the Action Hero + bloody mess and heavy gunner perk cards makes for a pretty devastating weapon, like I was shocked (I mean, I don't really use a 50 cal machine gun much but I was still pleasantly surprised).
---
“I want more situational cards I have to swap before doing X, I enjoy having to swap cards 20 times a play session depending what I’m doing at the moment” signed a grumpy person
---
Same, with the double vegetable harvest and double chem crafting perks, I can sell hundreds of healing salve for nothing, even more during verdant season. I mostly sell for the sake of interaction rather than profits.
---
So it’s a walking contradiction? Scorched killed off all humans, if the scorched stay there then humans can’t return
---
I meant for bloodied unyielding build it will anyway be sneaking, I don’t have any sneak boost and I am wearing heavy armor, shooting under queen’s nose without being detected
---
I'm curious if they actually have QA. At this point these are the people that need to be talking. If they exist. Why are you letting these types of issues go through. Or, **how** are you not noticing these things.
---
Even non-duped versions don’t irradiate you. Any normal legendary one that was found prior to the patch that fixed these things once and for all (might’ve been #8?) did not irradiate you. 
---
I had a TS one for a while that never gave me rads even after the patch. Wasn’t explosive or anything either.
---
Also I agree 110% that weightless ones are a great secondary to keep for bloodied or pistol builds. That and faster reload are the best 3rd perks for it.
---
Yeah mine's currently a roof ornament
---
I don't find it easy I just wanted to support the high level players that say the game is too easy.
---
For me, the game is ultra hard.
---
that's fine but you aren't the only one selling legendarys, and not everyone that is has back stock like you, it just doesn't make sense to me
---
you can server hop and test the terminal inside the cave that opens the door, if it takes more than 5 seconds to load find a new server. i can find good servers in no time.
---
They guy is a chick and no magic. I offered to make a vault jump suit. He already has the one that he came out of the vault with why would I offer to make that? This is the only option right now if you want a blue vault tech some thing on over under armor.
---
Happens on my main, but none of my other characters
---
PA raid set freezes up entire game for everyone not wearing it in the vicinity .. that's got nothing to do with internet provider .. also seeing people freeze when others use certain high power weapons .. that aint internet provider either ..
---
Keep an eye out for in player vending machines. I have seen it quite a bit, typically not at crazy prices either. Or check out the fo76 market place on reddit. I highly recommend that and the Unstoppable Monster (also was a survival weekly award)
---
Armoured mod and keep an excavator PA to hand for the extra carry weight
---
I think it was any legendary versions that existed prior to patch #8. That was the patch that actually fixed all the various problems with the gun
---
I noticed the same thing today. It is as if some of my perks don’t actually work. I am running no PA build and rely heavily on the no PA perks. It seems like the recent patches broke the game again. Getting really tired of this. It is unprofessional and kinda ridiculous.
---
Unfortunately, no. That is also a good resource but not what I'm looking for. Although I explained in the OP what I mean, let me rephrase and simplify it. (both list ideas/descriptions)
---
1. "I have a component. What can I make with this?"
---
2. "If I get that plan, what will I need to make the item?"
---
I don't have examples prepared but that should give you an idea. So wood (or wood scraps) would tell you stuff like camp walls, hunting rifle, etc.
---
The other list (probably a simpler task, although perhaps not quicker in making it) simply tells you what you need to craft the item you're going to learn to make. I mean, unless I haven't paid close enough attention, the game doesn't seem to tell us in advance. Unlike games such as WoW, which tend to tell you what materials you'll need before learning to create the item in question.
---
Yeah, that’s what I’m doing. I’m at about 650 scrip now so I’m saving up until that point.
---
Thanks mate!
---
I’ve never heard of this. Very unfortunate hopefully you can figure it out
---
I use and sell a lot of healing salve.
---
Same here. I keep most of my items for sale at 33 caps. I don’t need it. Might as well make it cheap for a low level player to benefit.
---
they literally said they aren't going anywhere, also where's the contradiction?  we're still alive
---
I wish this would be fixed though because it was seriously fun to launch my artillery around places like White Springs, since I'm close enough
---
What all perks do you guys run for dr and er
---
“The time limit isn’t a problem... as long as—” *checks notes* “the stars and planets align.” 
---
The point with time limits is it creates a fake sense of challenge. Raids, dungeons, etc are supposed to be challenging yes but in terms of game design a timer on such content is just lazy design. Again, previous games have tried this and the community has always hated it. 
---
I’m not saying the content should be easy, by far, in just saying it should be challenging in other ways. Look at WoW raids and dungeons. Some people take hours or days to complete them. They go at their own pace and forcing people into a time limit isn’t fun for a vast majority of gamers.
---
Do you already have all 5 armor pieces with your dream 3* legendary rolls? And are they all Heavy? If so, may I ask what kinda gear you're running?
---
What kind of weapons do you use, do they all have the 3* rolls that perfectly suit your playstyle?
---
To some people (like myself), grinding and trading legendaries to find that perfect set is part of the Fo76 endgame. I won't scrap something that can be used as a bargaining chip in upgrading a piece of my gear, and I seriously doubt anyone else  would too...
---
i second this and also there’s third party apps to find people for raids such as discord, xbox lfg, etc.
---
Fixer/comabt/radium all in the same boat. They compete aginst each other.
---
Handmade and assault rifle complete against each other... Unless I missed an upgrade that allows handmade to use 45 ammo? 
---
That's like saying why do people want 10mm when Western does more damage.
---
Sounds like you haven't used a bloody build. Also making bloody weapons rare is a way to deal with it being "game breaking," like you're talking about which you'd probably have a better idea about if you'd played as one and or as other useful builds.
---
Yeah I hear ya
---
Also heard it was broken weeks ago, have never noticed damage numbers increase while using it...
---
Well we're in the same boat
---
Yes... News is that there is no news.
---
No kind of reward can make me endure this crap.
---
And Reddit of course. They are on reddit saying they can’t find a team. On REDDIT! I have 2 teams of people for the raids I found on Reddit lol these people are crying for no reason.
---
I have a duck that follows me around the yard eating bugs while I cut the grass. I bet that duck could fix this game. Gonna get him a little brown leather jacket like Todds .
---
I scripped tens of junkie's weapons. Always seemed useless to me until it became meta or something next to bloodied. I rarely use Chems, so...
---
where?  how?  tell me this magical place where someone will give me the piece I want.  this is the apocalypse, do it yourself, rely on no one.
---
Yes I know sorry, I should made a bloodied build before posting this.
---
Pardon me.
---
They can find a team on Reddit ...  I have 2 teams of people I’ve found on Reddit.
---
I can imagine that in the boardroom...
---
"What is this Q and this A of which you speak?"
---
I would be surprised if it did work...
---
If you don’t upgrade any of the under armor, like the vault suit, you won’t add any DR. A standard backpack also doesn’t add any DR. I like to run around in base underarmor as outfits. 
---
I did not go cold turkey when leveling this character, but I did stay in low level armor so I would get used to being squishy and playing sneaky. I don’t remember what the threshold for DR is but I think even very low amounts start punishing berserker weapons.
---
It's also super OP. Prob not going to add a similar perk for PA.
---
Also, it's pretty stupid to force me to rush through your game. Make me want to look at everything, to stay at places just for the atmosphere, make me want to check details, don't make me want to be the fuck out of there asap.
---
I don't know who's downvoting you but is isn't me! And that magical place is the reddit marketplace. If you find a genuine godroll, post it on there and say you're looking to trade it for a different godroll. There is always someone who can use a godroll that doesn't go well with your playstyle/build, and it goes both ways!
---
Have you had a reply yet? I put one in too as now they’ve changed it, which is a bum deal for all those who have spent theirs.
---
The fact that it has been a year and Bethesda still don’t know wtf they are doing is laughable.
---
the caps arnt worth the 400 bucks that would cost me. 
---
Id rather buy a new handgun.
---
Nope, which is odd because normally when atom shop items are bugged they reimburse me over night.
---
lol and yeah, i don’t really like the timer, i was hoping for mini bosses or something else.
---
&gt; Survival escapees possibly?
---
A couple months ago, you know long before survival was canned, my wife was handing in a ton of cheap legendaries at Berkeley. Some level 75 thought she was taking too long so he started shooting at her. 
---
Well she hopped off the machine and killed him, flagging his other two group members hostile to both of us. I'm chameleon on top of the station rolling in laughter, apparently unnoticed by the group. She stands on top of the car with her 50 cal out. Guy respawns, whole group starts shooting her and blows up the car, she's still standing there with full health. 
---
We killed their group several times before they blocked us and left. We were the assholes from survival right?
---
Good for you? You shouldn't need to go to a different, unrelated platform to find a team for a multiplayer game. Not Discord, not Reddit, not YouTube, or any other social media. It's a failing of Bethesda that the game lacks basic features for a multiplayer game.
---
20 hours since you sold...
---
Exactly. I’m a lore person myself and I take way too long to complete content already because I’m checking every literal nook and cranny. I also like to discover stuff on my own, like when I found the Old One in the lead mines. I sh!t my pants out of excitement about that find lol.
---
Wasnt sure exactly when it was changed, just knew legacy ones didnt have it so i just went off of that
---
True, literally everywhere, even in Trading discords there are vault raid groups who are constantly looking for people to team up with and even are willing to explain the raid to unexperienced ones
---
20 hours
---
PS4 or Xbox?
---
exactly
---
Thats dope!
---
Exactly. People just want to be victims.
---
I’m level 400 and yes there are parts of the game that are rediculously easy, but others where i still die constantly with the best armour and weapons available with my bloodied build that is.
---
I assume your a guy the same way you assume the OP is a guy, unless you know him/her personally?
---
Anyway I know what you meant with the vault jumpsuit, but I don't think the OP knows the difference between a vault suit and a vault tec jumpsuit. 
---
It sounds like they are expecting a magic vault suit that can be worn over armour. I could be wrong though.
---
So let me get this straight, you server hop by leaving the world and then joining a new server by clicking "play"? Right?
---
Fantastic story and I would have loved to been there to watch :D Some people are way to impatient, if vendors are busy I just take a seat and chill :)
---
They do have one. Mics and invite to team. I’ve also found people to do raids with those features. People just want to whine. They have the resources right in front of them.
---
Squeaky wheel gets the grease.
---
Sorry I forgot to add that in. Both Xbox consoles
---
I fully believe they exist. They're either really bad at their jobs and should probably be updating up their resumés soon. Or, upper management is tying their hands. Either way. QA needs to fucking answer for all of this shit. If they pass the buck to upper management get UM on a fucking panel. Either way these people need to face the fucking music.
---
Edited, now the twitter army will be after me :(
---
Really?
---
Oh then I'll need to get prepared XD
---
Even high levels die.
---
Thanks for the info man.
---
We don't need a similar perk for PA, that perk needs to work with PA. It would still be more balanced than it is with lege dary armors.
---
Get both and just make 2 backpacks.
---
Thank you I hope so too
---
Level 60 mole miners please Bethesda
---
I didn't  say players relying on others.   The settlers would.  That would be the lore reason to do this.
---
As far as playing by yourself this wouldn't  change that.  It would be a little like the crafting in Wow but more interesting.
---
I will be happy to die for you this evening. My PSN is dixiemomma1577.  No payment needed. I’ll be on in a few hours
---
Ah you don’t get the sarcasm. They have no ability to stabilize their game whether it’s crashes   Dc or server side.
---
For reference I have a 170, a 130[xbox], a 120, an 85, 75 and a 70 on ps4. Also this is the worst fo76 sub.
---
Yeah that would be nice. I haven’t done the raid yet so other than the time limit thing I can’t say much. I’ve honestly avoided it with the whole character wipes, lag, etc, and the rewards are kind of meh IMO.
---
I’m uk so normally get a reply in the middle of the night. I’m guessing there’s nothing they can do about scrip or reimburse it. I spent 700 and out of 11 weapons I got 6 melee and 2 were exactly the same item. Can’t complain too much now the daily’s are giving scrip as means can get 1000 in 5 days. Also noticed that a lot of the cranberry events I’ve been doing have given me legendary armour but not listing it in the rewards.
---
Last thing I want to do while playing is to stop playing and go online to publish and sell something. I don't care if it is a bloodied handmade which gives you better erections and tax discounts. I am playing, let me play. Come to my vending machine if you want to buy and I shall do the same. Those high prices forums are sustained by their own population: many of us buy cheaper and sell cheaper because we are playing the game.
---
Is that 20 hours from  last sale? Or 20 hours from first sale?
---
As in, is it better to scrip all at the same time rather than a couple items every hour or so.
---
... sounds about right. 🙄
---
Yeah, that was a blast! I was on with Beehive and we were calming taking some workshops and then it quickly snowballed into an entire squad. So much fun. I want to hit up Encrytid (spelling?) with a group like we had last night!
---
I’ve had both of mine boot me off all the way back to the main screen and the game doesn’t even have the option to “quit”. 
---
I hard reset both (if you good Xbox hard reset it will give you the details, not just pressing the start button on console but a whole unplug deal) 
---
Since then it hasn’t done it. 
---
To be safe I’ve done this after each update and maybe too much but it hasn’t done it yet again...
---
Any studio can hire a FQA team from a third party studio if they cared enough. I worked at a third party studio in Montreal, and we tested H1Z1, Wow, Watchdogs, and other AAA titles even though they all have in house testers. When H1Z1 had a new map coming out, they contracted us to help. Now maybe bethesda is the worse run game studio in existance, and they don't have the funds for a second freelance team, even for a week, But i suspect they do it because they don't care. They see the game we're all content to play, with all it's annoying, constant bugs, and they think, "why would i spent anything hiring FQA workers, when we can spend nothing and keep our player base?" Just my opinion, but i haven't seen anything to believe otherwise. They knew this Mystery Box was coming for a month, and they still fucked it up? that's negligence, not an oopsie
---
Pretty sure first scrip
---
A kindly old magician showed me the way. I’m in CA/Pacific time... will be on about 9PM or so... PM me if you want to check it out. I don’t want to just blab it out because then EVERYONE will do it. I like feeling S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Armour. I have the high capacity and never use it, due to the negative effects.
---
I'm for the ani-armor. Try keeping a TS .50 on target.
---
Did they think we'd grumble? 'Cause they're absolutely riiiiiiight!
---
Negative effects?i dindt know this.thanx
---
I am pretty sure its since your 1st sale.  At least that seems to be how it lines up.
---
Andreslamantis. Like in here.
---
I can't see them doing map expansions for a while, considering how much space they already have to develop in the main map.
---
Lol neither did I till I started using. Look at them all to check what the down side is first.
---
So they're just jealous! He's cat Han Solo!
---
Havent played since January for a reason homie. Been on that #unistall kick for a minute
---
Same here, I carry both.  They're only a pound or something.
---
yes. Just like caps. 20 hours since your first sale.
---
I don't know if it counts but I've been playing since 25th December and I'm lvl 98. And yes I'm having a lot of fun.
---
A 10mm can kill most enemies in game. Silenced and hardened, you can place 5 headshots on a high level supermutant and not lose Stealth.
---
the same marketplace full of elitists that overvalue everything?  there is literally a way for me to get something in game that is worth more to me than caps, what is so hard to understand?
---
Im still looking for a quad assault rifle, so thanks for the tip.
---
I think it depends on the player. For me, I pretty much exclusively farm legendaries at this point, so I have tons of them. I always have a few days worth of scrip-worthy items saved up. 
---
At this point the odds of me hitting on a better item than I already have at The Purveyor are pretty slim. There’s a lot of good items I get that I just won’t use—I sold a TSE Gatling gun last night for 1200 caps, useless for my build, but I’m sure that person was ecstatic. It’s a waste to just scrip items like that. If someone else will buy it and use it, great. If not, I’ll dump it in the chipper before too long because I don’t want to hold the weight forever. 
---
This method has kept me flush with caps and kept my stash weight reasonable. That allows me to not worry much about cap or ammo farming, two things I find tedious.
---
All in favor of better head say aye.
---
i post things in about 1 minute...the loading screens takea bout as much timea s it takes for me to post soemthing on a trading site..so no lsot game play time!
---
then i get a pm and the player travels to me.. i dont really put much effort into it!
---
Its a win win really
---
So no screenshot then?
---
Thank you
---
It isn't hard to understand. You need godrolls in order to get other godrolls. Simple as that. But okay I'm sure you don't want to hear any of this so cya
---
whoa re you accusing of downvoting? i just now checked back on this thread.. its friday man! relax a bit!
---
I have a standard backpack and marine armor w/ deep pocket mods, plus my marine armor chest has weightless legendary effect.
---
I have 5 Strength with 2 points in Strong Back and 3 in Pack Rat. My base carry without aid buffs is 330 lbs.
---
I only carry ammo for weapons I have on me and limit mini nukes to 1 or 2 (for Daisycutter since it has 90% reduced weight) for the rare chance I want to use it. Sneaky Sniper build, so I mainly pick up .308 and .45
---
I've swapped to only using diluted Rad-X and Rad Away bc mutations and keep those and Stimpacks between 30-50. Med-x I carry about 10, I rarely remember to use it. Purified water I sell down to 30 if I'm toting too much &amp; usually sell all booze, chems, and spoil-able food except carry weight boosters for fast travel moments.
---
Fuck that I love both of them uranium fever by far is the best one
---
I think bloodied is good as it is
---
I mean I let you know how the game works. I'd figure a thanks is more appropriate than a pardon but this is r/fo76 ie garbage so idk why I have expectations of you at all.
---
there’s a pretty good theory of how the character wipe glitch works, but it hasn’t been proven
---
I got an aa ss rw super sledge for 400 caps a few days ago.
---
very nice! looks like it could have come built-in to the game. i see you have the “less is more” going on- i find it 1000 times more interesting when players don’t cram 1 of every camp item into their camp and you didn’t build a wasteland mansion. i’d just hang out there a bit and take it in
---
Happening on PS4 for me also.  Happening with every notification that is supposed to pop up.  I have a newer character and when I'm scrapping weapons I get the sound that I've unlocked a mod but nothing shows on the screen telling me which mod.
---
What do you mean?
---
I don't need to say sorry?
---
it's not that simple though, I have to get off the game, open a browser, find the trading site, find what I want, if it's even there, negotiate a price, then open the game and meet up with a stranger and use the broken ass trade menu.  how is that at all simple?  
---
or I could grind West Tek and scrip my legendarys and buy new ones from The Purveyor, all without leaving the game or dealing with another person.
---
&gt; I would love some new kick ass perk cards that start at lvl 100 and come in increments of 50....almost God level perk cards...
---
That sounds similar to the already announced legendary player system. Too bad it was delayed to 2020.
---
I sell rarer/nicer stuff at high prices, but much less than I see them go for on the market sub. I'd rather give a wider range of players the chance of having that stuff, and I'm lazy so dumping it on a vendor and letting people find it suits me. This week I've sold Fixer, backback and dense mod plans, plus some VE weapons. Making nice money, but people buy them reasonably quickly, so my prices aren't horribly high I hope.
---
Yea I know. Bethesda Game studio used to only employ around 100 people, now they have over 300. The parent company is Zenimax. I was just putting out that they do have the income to hire people.
---
sounds like hard drive failure, perhaps a heat issue if xbox has auto shutdown for temp limits
---
relationship goals on point!
---
how is 1200 caps more valuable than scrip?  you can get that on a vendor run...
---
this game just CANNOT get itself out of the fire, i swear.
---
I think people should really stop trying to use that excuse of "coding and testing is hard!" - i think Beth just literally isn't 100% sure what to do with and how to fix their game.
---
I feel bad for people like Lady Devann and Valseek who have to be the community face of this company
---
Yeah, I get dashboarded too and I reset/clear the MAC Address and that seems to fix it for a while, but it inevitably happens again at a later date and I just repeat. I switch my consoles off by the mains every night (after powering it down of course) so they get the well needed rest period lol. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it happens more than it should
---
Meat hook is broken because of game design. It could be fixed.
---
Place your camp in a low level area far from enemies spawns.
---
Also not really it. But like all the things I've found so far and that are being linked here, they're good resources. The things that I'm specifically looking for and that I mentioned here are probably not really important or needed by most players. So I'm just hoping to find out if anyone has been bothered to make it because they're really just resources for people who like to plan stuff out into silly detail. Making long lists of materials, etc.
---
So my expectation for finding these things already existing is low. Also, I'm now wondering if there is any fan made website which links to all of the known resources, like someone else said they'd do but I couldn't find that.
---
carry both! high capacity had a RR debuff. the armor is totally worth it, i have a fragile build and actually rely on it.
---
Yeah, I killed at least half the list during one Scorched Earth run alone. Yet another bugged challenge among many.
---
I didn't accuse you of downvoting, just the asshole that likes to tell people how to play the game
---
Do you honestly think anyone should have to do that? Do you believe the game design and mechanics were built around that?
---
Yeh me to,im gonna go for the armor first and then grind for the high one.
---
if it was a heat issue it would show warning messages for overheating and wouldn’t allow for the console to turn back on until it’s cooled down. and 76 is literally the only game this happens with (I play a lot of Gears and other games too)
---
Oh wow, you have no idea how much I appreciate this and you willing to help me out. Thank you!! Oxox
---
That would be very nice
---
thank you for saying this, too many people just won’t learn how to do them properly. also one of my friends completed it on a second character at level 5 in a mediocre group. they got the expert mask at level 11 on that character when we grouped for expert on dead in the water
---
While it is very true that bloodied weapons can be almost gamebreakingly powerful, they have disadvantages too.
---
To make a bloodied weapon perform the way people talk about, you basically have to sink all of your perks into a very specific set of skills.  You will have about 10 perk points to swap to other pleasntries if you are doing it right. 
---
As a player who swore against bloodied builds for a long long time because I also thought they were stupid and broken, I decided to use some stored up perk points and try one out.   
---
I found the following:
---
I do a stupid amount of damage.
---
Shit dies really really fast.
---
So do I.
---
Bloodied really excells when in a group setting, letting someone else take the punishment so you can focus on doing what bloodied builds do.   Damage.
---
Bloodied is effectively Fallouts version of the glass cannon, pure DPS, no tanky, dies easy, but dont be in front of their gun.
---
If you are in level appropriate content like SBQ, Arktos, 94, bloodied is scary because at any moment you could just be dead and not know why, because that lvl 40 radroach you didnt see snuck up on you while you were focused on the super mutie and chewed off your feet.  
---
Yes, even bugs are a threat when rocking a full bloodied build at 19%
---
It is not an invincible build, very far from it.
---
Strongly disagree, but yes they do need balancing. As in the other effects need improving.
---
beserkers, nocturnal both need their negative effects removing.
---
Enemy specific damage should be increased from 30% to 50% (assassins from 10% to 50%)
---
Mutants effect needs to stack like junkies effect does. More mutations more damage, up to 50% with 5 mutations.
---
The rest are fine and bloodied isn't without it's negatives. You need to plan ahead so as to not get overwhelmed as your at such low health to get the full bonus and also, it requires the use of many other perks to get the insane damages people are sometimes doing. Whereas instigating, junkies, furious and the enemy specific ones don't.
---
i’d say excellent choice. that’s the route i took and i only use high capacity when i have lead i refuse to part with (and just long enough to get to a stash i might add)
---
I’m on lvl 101 and I don’t think I’ve seen that event show up yet to be honest.
---
Could you tell me a good price for my 2* TS -33% Vats Cost Auto Grenade Launcher. I think it's quite good and rare but don't know how to price it.
---
next guess would be corrupted game files. if other games are fine then HDD failure is probably not the issue.
---
no, but it’s what you have to do for now until the lag is fixed.
---
yeah this game needs next gen, also the PS4, even the pro, is the least powerful of this generation
---
Good, so at least I don't have to hoard everything and sell it all together. We need more than 150 a day though for fuck sake!
---
standard backpack, all the mods have negative effects
---
It is a well known bug. I noticed this a few days after the release.
---
Turn on pacifist?
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say Survival mode or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
I’m still having a blast. They just finished meat week and implemented a new “Clean Appalachia” event with milestone goals/rewards. The next big DLC “Wastelanders” will be coming out next month so if you plan to get back into it, I’d do it before that drops so you can see the changes it makes.
---
Moral of the story is, fuck Bloodied builds. Bloodied should be disabled at events.
---
it’s probably to bridge the gap for the load time of the inventory.
---
The real issue is the humiliation you feel when looking at a vendor, or with your Pip Boy open, and some random scorched shows up and lays your 200+ level toon out in front of a lvl 30 something.
---
Because the game is majority shit with a few positive things, hence the majority complaints vs. The few positive posts. I've played since launch but that definitely isnt because the game. Was just about to uninstall when I found this wonderful little group of people. Without them I would have traded the game back in to gamestop and gotten 37 cents and some bubblegum.
---
Its not  TEAM problem.... its a timer problem... its not fun! Make the raid HARDER put lvl 200 enemies inside.... screw timers...
---
100% this
---
Lol seriously?
---
You didn’t miss anything. It is still a bugged mess with laggy servers and poor optimization. It is sad, but it is true.
---
I'm not sure if you know, but there is a quest line you must do prior to doing Encryptid.
---
https://www.newsweek.com/fallout-76-lowe-down-guide-recall-keycard-circuit-board-walkthrough-1392276
---
Once done, you can just get recall keycards from vendors.
---
I stopped playing months ago and honestly don't know how this game still has any significant player base. Bethesda literally fucks up at EVERY turn, alternating between incompetence (stuff like in OP's post) and malice (Atomic Shop debacles and event XP deflation for example). The more of an outsider-looking-in I have become, the more obviously off-putting this game reveals itself to be. I've literally never been more disappointed in a video game or a company I once loved.
---
I agree but these people aren’t asking for that. They are asking for rewards for easier content. No timers and stronger enemies isn’t easier but right now on novice that would be too easy to get plans from.
---
scrap kits yo!
---
Action Hero is also a "legacy" now.
---
it should not be solo able, as the loot you get is the best in the game and this is the only thing the high level players have that is actually challenging.
---
Yes!! I want to be able to label myself as hostile outside of picking locks for 20 mins. I have only ever done it twice and it was probably the best PvP experience I’ve had.
---
I have a quad extra limb damage assaultron head. It Is the gun which starts the fight, like a black powder rifle. It takes 20 loads and some time, but it can cripple or kill anything, whatever the size. It's my go gun for glowing level 76 Yao guai and similar enemies.
---
I’ve died to several mutant hounds 😭😂
---
TL:DR:  "So ... the error is on the person that fixed that world drop bug almost 3-4 weeks ago now. They didn't take the time to wonder if this problem that we have pointed out to them could be showing up elsewhere and they just shipped the Mystery Pick it seems without giving it another once-over. "  
---
Being a fly on the wall as this whole thing went down, here is what I observed ...
---
The basic Legendary Script has been a mess since launch. Which is why the drills and syringers kept showing up as legendaries and despite multiple attempts to fix, they never did.  But that wasn't the only problem, there were all sorts of missing legendary prefixes, and some mis-named one ( disease prevention was mis-labeled as rad resistance )

They kept trying to fix it but ... you know how that worked out.  And its not "hard" but it is tedious work because for example, rad resistance legendary effect, some use "spells" , some use entitlements, others use enhancements - and some effects have literally 5 similarly named spells in the files that were all zzz'd out for various reasons- so you can't just copy and paste the list, you need to really go through each and every one and make sure you are using the right spells\\enhancement etc   
---
For example, this photo from the game files hilariously sums it up:   [https://imgur.com/a/So71rcE](https://imgur.com/a/So71rcE)   
---
"This spell is a hack for all perks that need to use the "Apply Combat Hit Spell" to place a spell on the target you are attacking. Unhelpfully, only one instance of that perk entry point is allowed to work at the same time, making perks override each other. Therefore they must all cast this single spell, which has conditions to determine which affects to apply. Yeah... "
---
So ... along comes the Purveyor.  They did the right thing and basically rebuilt the entire thing from scratch.  It was so much better than the old script ... probably because they needed to separate ranged, melee and armor out individually and then by stars, so whoever did it - built it by hand.  
---
It was so much better than the current one that in the very next game update, they literally copy-pasted it to create a new world drop list that is in use today,but its the same as the purveyor's 9 lists put together.   But... there was a problem , it was missing some modifiers when they did the copy-paste.   
---
Weirdly, the Purveyor's main individual lists did not have some of the issues but the world drop one did.  Eckserah messaged Devann and in the next update, the world drops were fixed.   Now ... we get to the Mystery Pick. As far as we can tell, the mystery pick was supposed to go live with the Purveyor which is why you saw it in the promotional photos.  But it had a number of logic things wrong with it and they pulled it on their own after noticing it.   Eckserah noticed it too but didn't get a chance to say anything before they pulled it from release.   
---
So ... the mystery pick just sort of sat there ... and the logic stuff was fixed but it had the same problem that world drop list had, where it only have like 2 modifiers for melee and 3 for for some ranged.   Best guess, is they copy-pasted one or the other to create the world drop list from the Mystery Pick.   
---
So ... the error is on the person that fixed that world drop bug almost 3-4 weeks ago now. They didn't take the time to wonder if this problem that we have pointed out to them could be showing up elsewhere and they just shipped the Mystery Pick it seems without giving it another once-over.
---
That's some American gun law logic right there
---
If they think it’s shit then why are they playing still? There has to be a reason why they are still coming back to keep playing. Yes I’ll admit. It has its problems but you have to give them credit where credit is due. This is their first time doing a game on this scale for fallout. It’s not going to be 100% perfect. I mean fuck. Look at the black ops games. Every single one has shit connection. But you don’t see people bitching about it and activision is a triple A company. And yet people still play it even with the problems
---
I've had it happen a few times on my Xbox. Kinda worried this game would brick it.
---
They are amazing people I will say that. The devs aren't really responsible for this mess. As a programmer myself I don't get to just work on anything I have strict lists of things that I'm allowed to work on and I'm pretty sure it's the same for them.
---
Very welcome. I’ll let you know when I get online!
---
Ask us in a month or so when the Wastelanders DLC comes out. It will add human NPCs with Fallout 3 style dialogue choices that matter
---
How do you all even get so many good legendaries!?
---
I have the quad extra limb damage assaultron head. Sheepsquach and Yao guai can survive the critical head shot. They are tough. I have all gunsilger and critical and Stealth perks.
---
hi, if oyu are on ps4 and ever get another fixer plan, id be willing to trade or buy one!  i have horribel luck with the sheepsquanch!
---
Agreed. I got two suppressor swing speed knuckles in a row the other night.
---
Yeah i was the same for such a long time, didn't like bloodied, thought it was cheap and unsporting! But I had a decent bloody weapon drop and had a spare 5 or so levels to use so I picked serendipity, dodgy, radicool etc.
---
 Even with a half arsed build the damage was great, but I wasn't much use at things like encrypted (pylons) and arkos, i daren't even try the vault raids!
---
I think it actually feels fun having to be on the look out for packs of charred ghouls and, bloodbugs! It's a fun way to play. 
---
I do think that there should be some downside to having such high rads though, as it's almost mandatory with a bloodied build. Maybe have it so you have periodic food and water loss from being sick all the time!
---
Yeah, I've had some of those crazy packed mansion builds in the past, but I tend to think it looks too "busy" when it's built like that. Glad you liked it!
---
This has happened to me before. Very strange because the Xbox INSTANTLY shuts off like the power cord is pulled out. I was thinking it is temperature related, although there are no warnings/errors and Xbox will turn back on without a problem. 
---
As a precaution I have been running a small fan pointed into the right side of Xbox and it has not happened to me since.  Just my two cents.
---
I've had it happen a few times. Usually loading in after a fast travel. Crashes and powers the Xbox off.
---
Shut up and take my upvote
---
I'm not saying it should be solo-able by lower level players, 
---
Make it a tough challenge to solo, but not impossible.
---
I've seen the video of the guy who solo'd the 2nd vault raid, but that was utter min-max without any room for mistakes.
---
I'm no game designer, but I'd balance a solo raid so that a min-max player would find it intermediary difficult.
---
But your average vet player would find it hard.
---
I don't want any players who have already grinded the "raid" to get salty about it, but there needs to be a viable solo option, where you can learn the plans
---
I have only gotten rp from spinning the wheel on GTA online. I think I got 15,000 chips once.
---
Don't worry mate, ignore this person. just go try a bloodied build, you might enjoy it.
---
hmmm, that is a niche item, i found those sell way better if they have a weight reduction perk, IN GAME id say you could sell it for 1500-2000 caps at your vendor since its a 2 shot
---
if i were you, id start the pricing at like 3000 caps and lower it as needed if noone buys it in a few sessions, i thinkn 3000 is too high for in game BUT you never know! all it takes is that one right person!
---
OR you could post it on a reddit trading site and say "price check" then hopefully people will chime in on what they also think its worth
---
good luck!
---
I'd like to run the vault.. haven't had a tram to try harder difs
---
I worked as project lead for a FQA/LQA team on a few games. I would be ashamed of myself if this was the wrok my team was putting out. Normally there's some discussion about whether the problem is the Devs or the FQA team(On H1Z1 we would give them an extreme number of bugs that they didn't fix), but unless the Devs are literally the worse team imaginable, it's the FQa's fault for not catching bugs like this.
---
Well, if you uninstalled the game just for scrap kits maybe you don't like the game in first place. I like playing fo76 and all the community around it.
---
Vault 94 is the location of the raids. Your best bet is to search YouTube most likely to figure out what to expect.
---
It's currently only vault 94 that's open.. it's up close to the pumpkin house
---
I actually had one person come into my camp and YELL at me over voice chat once.  So I left the world and took my business elsewhere. There is always going to be someone that isn't happy.
---
The real crazy thing is looking through "completed auctions" and seeing someone pay $160 for a single weapon or $230 for a armor set.  Who the fuck spends hundreds of dollars for virtual items in a video game???  I want that persons disposable income.
---
The main reason for this is because the raids are incredibly unstable and laggy.
---
I gave each week a few tries, but had to take a 2 hour break after each run due to having headaches caused by the crappy frame rate.
---
And although its a rare occurrence, I'm afraid of losing my gear to the glitch that wipes your character
---
When did you stop playing, what level are you, and what build are you/do you want to run
---
Go up by redrocket in the north. You get a radio signal taking you to vault 94.
---
If your solo most likely you will die but novice has no timers so you get the layout and the idea. Then got to find a team of people to run it with on standard and difficult.
---
1 raid per week with 3 total. 2 sets of armor and 1 PA that have a unique bonus when you wear the set. But thats going to tale some time.
---
Just run them on novice and bring a lot of supplies.
---
Trading, purveyor, find them in vending machines, etc.  I have a ongoing post on that other sub which shall not be named with a ton of good legendaries.  And there are people with waaaaay more then me to the point where I don't know how they keep track.
---
good thing is we can each play how we want!  i kind of feel like you are inflating the "trouble" of posting something online, kind of like those infomercials where they make a normally simple task seem like its so hard, like "all these tupperwares! " and the person drops them all over the kitchen flailing their arms around trying to hold onto the tupperwards lol
---
no offence meant! its just not too hard to make a post online as you are waiting to load as you fast travel somewhere
---
Yeah I’m tired of the “I never had a time limit issue” people. That’s great that you and four of your buddy’s each memorized 50+ different key card spawn points to get through the raid with a minute left to spare.
---
What would a MAC Address edit help with? Try checking your HDDs I had a similar issue with my PS4 I replaced the HDD and it fixed it.
---
I love my melee weapons though!  So that’s all I carry with me, so I’m not prepared to come across a SB.
---
Sorry I'm on PC.
---
just shoot me a message on xbox and i’ll invite you to a party when i am able to hop on
---
Go get the body and keep it. You'll never hear the mayor again.
---
Thanks friend 🤗
---
Fuck no
---
the raids are difficult but offers the best armor in the game
---
I make most of my money selling ammo and food items. I sell everything at less than half of the in game sale value - it's not hard to make money in game, why bother trying to hustle your fellow players? When I see a camp I like, I usually buy something to leave a tip. Attention to detail and interesting architecture/design mean more to me than prices, but I'm sure I'm one of the few people who operates that way.
---
have you ever made a deal in an online game using a forum before?  it's a right pain in the ass, especially, as I said, when we have an in game alternative.  and as I said, making the post is only part of it, you also have to meet a stranger, when it's convenient for both, and deal with the broken trade menu, it's like you ignored my post entirely and only focused on making a post, which I never even brought up as part of the process because it's not the hard part.
---
Perfectly stated especially mutants
---
I can give them credit for their product whenever it works. When you sell a full priced game you have an expectation that it will be a working product, not one that breaks every hour. If you intend on selling a product like this then either delay it (because it was rushed) or dont sell it for a full price, then have a microtransaction store that sells skins for almost $20. 
---
People, including me, still play this game either because they have friends in it or because they want this game to succeed. The inherent problem is that they released a broken game and still, almost a year later,  we still have a broken product that still had issues from their previous games.
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Cool will do!
---
Yeaaaaah. I put 100+ hours into it. I like the game. Don't like the way the atom shop was going.
---
THIS
---
They would actually need to play their own game first to see the bugs
---
This event should have been been instanced like what they've done with the vault. I have no desire to do a scaled rewards event with players I'm unfamiliar with because it never seems to go well.
---
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
It doesn't work as there is a power armour mod that reduces damage at low health. Emergency protocols.
---
+25% speed and +50% damage reduction when below 20% health.
---
That, stacked with dodgy, stacked with lone wanderer, stacked with fireproof, stacked with nerd rage, then stacked with serendipity would be too much.
---
However. It is shit that they don't mention it on the perk description!
---
We’re already like 50% done with challenge in 4 days out of the 14 days we are given
---
that's how horde modes work, the reason a horde of enemies is after you is they already know you're there
---
Nah Bloodied is balanced the way it is think about it this way,  you’re trading Health for Damage and most people run it at 25 HP and lower so they’re vulnerable to any form of damage whether is a lot or little is still lethal.
---
Thats awesome. I'm sending a friend request now but I wont be on till later. I'm actually not 100% sure I'll be on today but I definitely will find you at some point soon! I will let you know about the skeleton outfit for my friend. I know he has the mask for sure but I'm not sure about the outfit. I cant wait! Psn is MammaT22. Thank you so much!
---
They should just remove all legendaries out of the game period. No one should be able to get more loot faster then anyone else, it's an unfair advantage! Same with the backpacks, everyone should have the same carry weight and just deal with it. And PA and armor should be cosmetic only, it's not fair to those who don't want to wear any. No one should have better stats then anyone else, it should be based on skills only!!
---
No, it doesn't. You can't easily mod files on ps4 like you can on pc.
---
XD ok mate got the message. I'll make a bloodied build the next time.
---
Sorry
---
Is about right actually, already happened.
---
You on Xbox? If so what's your GT. Ill come buy gear for my guild bank.
---
Got it.
---
No, this is a terrible idea for fo76.  The last thing I want are a bunch of cheaters from PC.
---
I'm not, and I'm sorry for it.
---
Nice one mate
---
um, i specifically stated i have made many deals in an online game using a forum... and i stated a rebuttal of your accusation it is "hard" to post things on line and then have a person fast travel to wherever you are in game.  
---
i feel like you just want to argue, i have resisted downvoting you so far, but, i think ive exhausted my patience.
---
Like i said before, each person can play how they want.  If you dont want to trade on subforums, then you can choose not to!
---
and now, i will bid you a "good day sir!"
---
Prepare for hackers and cheaters.
---
ok, thanks for the reply!
---
So is mine
---
your "rebuttal" didn't mention ONE of the points I made in my post, so either learn how to rebut or leave me alone
---
And microsoft has more than enough money to hire people to work on a VR version of Mine Sweeper.  I have a feeling they won't be approving that one though.  
---
They *could* throw a ton of money at 76, they could totally afford to do that.  They could have done that from the beginning.  But they didn't, and there's no real reason to believe that they will start to do that in the future unless they believe it will be worth the investment.  I'm not sure Zeni has that much faith in 76 at this point.
---
They already announced they are working on the frequency, it was in one of the recent inside the vault updates. 
---
They are going to increase frequency.
---
A few months back they totally nerfed legendary drop rates in game, you used to be able to get legendaries off of diseased mutants in whitesprings as well, and you could get a "hot server" where almost every other enemy dropped a legendary, i shit you not!
---
Also, watoga used to have legendary robots that were super easy to kill, they nerfed that as well
---
I'd rather they didn't with all the pc hacks.
---
Yeah, that’s what I do, I pull to the front door.  One ghoul always gets stuck, but the rest all come.  It’s a lot of fun.
---
No. Form a team and complete the endgame content. Its easily doable with two people on standard.
---
Lol is your controller.
---
Agree, in game is where the juice is. The trading sub and discords have turned into elitist lounges, unfortunately.
---
"Hello, what would you like for your weightless perception blocker robot left arm?"
---
"BE Fixer or legacy, no caps"
---
...wtf.
---
I've gotten some great pieces from you amazing wasteland vendors - thank you for keeping it real :)
---
are you trying to solo? this is __not__ solo content.  id also like to see stability and the few bug improvements for the raids as well. id also lile to see a real matchmaking system put in. let me get that out of the way, now onto the meat.
---
novice imo should not give plans, it is a mode for __practice and learning__ the raids and the mechanics and patterns.  after 2-3 runs you should have a basic understanding enough to do standard with a semi competent group, after about 10 you should be able to carry and walk others through it.  the puzzles are not complicated.
---
after about 10 standards (or less) on top of those practice novice you should be ready to be able to run expert.  expert is all about running your teams routes in a timely manner. (and ffs stop trying to kill everything in expert)
---
for refrence, on xbox one both of the teams i run with can run standard with 20+ minutes left, and normally clear expert with 2:30-3:15 left. on top of it once you have enough runs down you can talk first timers through standard and get a first try win.
---
tldr: disagree, novice is for pratice, standard is already easy with a team.  the real issue is we need a party finder system and server stability fixes.
---
I usually sit in the train station benches and wait my turn, or use the sit pose behind them. Once I had two other players run in and look at me, realize what I was doing and do the same thing, patiently waiting in line to use the vendor. It was possibly the most beautiful moment in any fallout game to date.
---
and those “victims” are now downvoting our comments.
---
hear hear! I've been playing for 10 months, and have yet to team up with a single person.  joining events is one thing, but team perks and communicating would be nice.
---
Right before that, helped down the queen got killed by a mirelurk king didn't get the loot for defeating the queen
---
im the same way but with low level vendors selling obviously low level stuff, i try to buy some stuff to support the small business out there!
---
Instanced or not, I think even with a coordinated group, a bad combination of weak friendly creatures and powerful bosses with ranged attacks makes success heavily dependent on RNG. :/
---
Was he using it semi-auto or full auto?
---
Economy in this game is broken. Or economy in this game is not existing. 
---
There is no good price. There is no bad price. There is no low nor high  price. 
---
Go check eBay or Amazon. Ask those peoples there to arrange you 100 TSE Handmades with faster fire rate and for the right price($) they will duplicate those things for you.
---
sorry im pn ps4 but i bet another redditor might chime in to assist you!
---
Cool, well I've accepted your friend request and I'll definitely be on this weekend, so I'll see you out there! :-)
---
If I get home from work early enough today I’ll take you up on this!
---
It is a full auto, but he used it as a semi for most of the video.
---
When I talk cross play I generally mean console to console. I don't like mixing pc with most games.
---
LEAVE YOU ALONE! THIS IS MY THREAD I STARTED! wth!?!?!?
---
man you earned yourself a shiny new "block"
---
I don’t base my opinion on a gun based on the ammo type. On my rifleman I carry .45 and 5.56 so I’m fine either way.  I guess I could make the fixer use .38s so it’s basically “free” to use since people throw out .38s.
---
the character wipe glitch has a good theory on how it works, i will not say it as it can be used maliciously. the laggy part is easily fixable, just server hop until you find a fast server. i don’t personally have a problem with frame rate as long as no one is using a tse heavy automatic weapon.
---
I'm lvl 122 right now and the Yao guai still kill me in two swipes, they're the only enemy I actually fear. I wish deathclaws weren't so weak in this game, it's a weird design decision.
---
None of those friendlies are level one.
---
Room B at lvl 1 is a ghoul.
---
the bane of any good trader are those @#$@%^^@ dupers
---
also, im pretty sure alot of the methods they use to dupe stuff is a leading contributor to crap server performance and crashes!
---
I’ll have time to test it in a few hours after I run some errands.  I hope you guys are right about the fixer being better than my handmade.
---
Umm, I don’t really agree with this. I usually see someone selling a bloody chef outfit for 3000-4000, and selling a explosive pipe revolver for 11k
---
If you use power armor the action hero. If you don’t use power armor the anti armor.
---
The actual picture is the one you took in the vault. You can take another with that frame in photo mode and it will display the level you took it at.
---
Ah, yes, that other wild wasteland, GTAO
---
That seems about right to me. I sell most plans, ammo, aid items, etc. for cheap. I'll also drop free stuff for low levels regularly. But legendaries, hard to find outfits, or pain-in-the-ass plans (looking at you Robot Armor pieces) I sell at a premium.  
---
P.s., Any of you got a sweet, sweet plasma grenade plan to spare?
---
Lol
---
Maybe level up a bit?
---
I can’t see them not having enough funds to hire third party. They just figure, like you said, the consumer is our testers and that’s an awful business model. But we keep buying so until that stops they’ll keep the machine going.
---
Sad lol
---
Bloatfly.
---
um.. I just walk up and hit the button to open the menu..
---
My suggestion would be to lower the feed requirements before the animals spawn, if I’m grabbing every plant/whatever I need and can’t spawn anything stronger than a boatfly then something needs to change
---
That's terrible.
---
I've heard about it, but never experienced it until today. I was at a vending machine, and someone decided to go non-stop explosive .50 cal at me while I was browsing... so I kept browsing. I bought something nice too, but probably would have completed my shopping much faster if not for the irritation.
---
Px
---
Sneak past them and also level up
---
to agree with this, but a lfg system isn’t necessarily needed as we have multiple third party options to find players, yes it would be nice to have for people who can’t find a group but i just don’t see a point in adding it when we have 3rd party options.
---
The answer is money. They control the deadlines and nobody here would complain if they put stuff on hold and fixed the base game. But again, that cost money, when you could just do the base amount of work and just keep adding to the atom store for the die hard fanboys
---
I thought it was 8 million. I'm sure the number will jump quite a bit during the weekend since there are usually more queen nukes. As far as weapons in vendors I'm just happy when it isn't a bunch of non legendary items or extremely overpriced.
---
I am interested in this as I wanted to do Vault 94 but most players I know hate the raid and haven't found a full squad to do it with.
---
Bethesda take notes!
---
i agree the pipe revolver is over priced by far!
---
the bloody chef outfit i dont see a problem with ( i sell mine for about 500 caps each) as they are a  limited time only thing, you cant get them anywhere else in game
---
true, most of us got waaaay too many of them so the market is flooded, but for those who didnt get one, or missed meat week, or are new players, they cant get them anywhere else!
---
supply and demand baby!
---
i agree there are alot of vendors who price things a bit too high in game still, but you cant blame them, they can do what they want, and maybe they arent keyed into the ebb and flow of pricing as a true merchant
---
the best thing to do is exercise your power as a consumer and only give business to merchants you feel price fairly
---
What platform are you on? I might just have to go visit your shop sometime
---
It wouldn't be "too much" anymore than assassin sentinel or cavaliers stacked with all of those same perks. Or unyielding sent ir cav.
---
No, this was on pc. Why were there kids screaming pvp? lol
---
I completed 3 ways of this raid at novice. And I dont want to find group to complete normal or expert. So I completely abandoned this raid content and will never go back, because I have no interesting reward at novice. And if Bethesda put plans in novice i'll back to Vault 94, again and again, each day. But now - it's just dead content fo me.
---
I did that with a combat. Hardly any damage loss for free ammo. My guy is comando so makes no difference if its 3 or 4 bullets to kill.
---
Most rifle players keep somekind of .45 gun on them. Semi auto has the lever so may not see as many radiums or combat but commando eats thru ammo so having options is very nice.
---
Personally i sell all handmades and all 5.56 ammo. Guaranteed to stay rich or have a trade for something i want.
---
A raider suggesting pacifist. Never thought I'd see the day
---
Tried 2. Not it. I sent in a ticket w/ video. Hell I even checked my internet run speed and it’s good. I’ll be walking and just slow down like I’m over encumbered then it picks up for a few steps and does it again.  I’m over it.
---
I suggested this exact thing a month ago..
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d1rn6f/uranium\_fever\_should\_not\_be\_considered\_a\_public/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d1rn6f/uranium_fever_should_not_be_considered_a_public/)
---
now i rarely ever see my fave event for loading up on scrap. when I do see it I haven't had less than 8 people there with me, most trying to kill the Legendary as fast as they can. Every time I have played since it become a public event there has been at least 1, usually more, fritatas racing to kill the legendary. On top of that you have to deal with the literally dozens upon dozens of mole miners that spawn which would normally be awesome, except that the event area isn't nearly large enough to hold them all. it turns into one big cluster f\*\*\* with idiots jumping around everywhere spraying everything with their explosive auto guns.. making it public has ruined a very useful event..
---
hire a body gaurd, as in a high level player.
---
You might not have anything they want in return, but chances are you'll get help for free as many high levels are bored anyway!
---
It's 8 million to get another 25% off sale. We only had to kill 500,000 for the first challenge, but we got more stuff for killing 750,000. So if they're wanting plus another half to make it a 50% sale, we'll have to kill an extra four million
---
hi, im on ps4, my psn id is FritoZ, i have 3 dedicated merchants with TONS of stuff on my character as the weights are vastly reduced if i keep stuff on my character as opposed to in stash or in vending machine, so feel free to ask what im holding too!
---
The sneak definitely works, I got past numerous high level enemies without being detected thanks to this gun, I only snuck as I was out of ammo!
---
30 weapons and they're all legendaries?  I would be impressed
---
People will argue about it but big true
---
i agree as well but it is by far the most common complaint outside of people trying to solo it for some unknown reason or server stability.
---
i personally got 1 team off this sub, and 2 teams off the xbox lfg that il normally run with, so as you said there are workarounds.
---
afterall, once you learn the roles it just becomes a cakewalk, even on expert.
---
Yep. Thaaaank you
---
Dude it was crazy. I spawned in and saw madness so I videoed as much as I could then these kids showed up screaming at the other guys at ws "we caught you" pvp me. Lol it was an interesting situation.
---
send me a message on xbox if you want to do it and i’ll invite you when i get on
---
But they dont.
---
I’d also look at permissions in your router. I know Fallout and other online games to include Xbox live need certain ports open.... just an idea. 
---
You could also uninstall the game fully and delete the game info from one console at a time then reinstall it. 
---
With all the updates I’d understand that data can get messed up. 
---
Might be worth a try...
---
Believe me that sounds like Joystick Death if you haven’t tried it try playing with a different controller does this only happen in Fo76?
---
Pack it up fellers. Debate over.
---
Just wait and see if and when the Purveyor does a 50% off sale. Nobody will be able to move after turning in 1,000 scrip per character and only getting to scrip back 150 per day.
---
I agree, those effects are also too much. Which is why people ignore power armour. Standard armour needs a nerf, or at least a cap on the effects of similar pieces used together.
---
try playing it on standard to actually get the plans.
---
Youtube! Still havent done them myself.. so I cant actually be much help.. but I know theres videos of people doing solo runs. I'm sure theres also walkthroughs.. but more importantly, thank you for doin what you do so we can sit our dork asses on the couch after work and save the fake universe 👍
---
Why wouldn’t it? Most games get about a year or so of additional support: Dlcs or “free” updates. Hell Wastelanders is about to be released within a month or so. Todd Howard goes on record saying there are plans in place to support the game for a decade but realistically I say 2 to 3 years total. Maybe they’ll do bug fixes for an Additional year or so. Hell Fo4 is still getting updates came out in 2015. Skyrim came out nearly a decade ago and is still getting support.
---
Unless you're still in your 20s (or maybe 30s), the cost of travel shouldn't be something you think about, it's shouldn't be enough to put a dent in your wallet.  You can easily earn enough caps that fast travel costs won't be a thing you bother thinking about.  Hell, I frequently forget to equip Travel Agent, and I don't care.
---
(none of that applies if you're still leveling, so I totally get it if that's the case, and I completely agree that it's a huge bonus for lower level players)
---
You’d think Bethesda might note what weapons and armor are getting turned in and no one is using... like get the hint Bethesda...lol
---
Lol we will all zombie walk around Appalachia.
---
I have. The armor is trash. The power armor is trash. The raids are only great when its bugs to farm acid. Otherwise its shit tier end game gear.
---
The irony is a data miner found the bug by just LOOKING at the data. There was clearly only limb damage as the sole secondary trait for melee and only agi and rw for tertiary. 
---
Didn't even require testing, just a casual glance from anyone who understands how legendary effects are supposed to work.
---
Only thing I hate is the darn trade glitch.
---
Seems like it resets at 5pm
---
If you only need lead, you don’t have to run the silo. Put on pack rat perk (junk weight reduced by 75%). The weights are in the first part (residential area) of the silo, so you go in, grab the weights from the exercise room, and then exit the silo.
---
Why were the mines sad??
---
Scrap kits broke the game
---
Allegedly
---
Resets everyday a 5pm pst
---
Unfortunately 90%+ of YouTube “how to” video walkthroughs are filled with pointless info or you watching as they pick up a ballpeen hammer or pick a lock that has nothing to do with video title...
---
Bloodied is fine. The perk stacking of weapons is what needs to be fixed.
---
3/4 now, it's up to 6 million.
---
If you diss Wheelies ONE more time it is my sovereign right to smack a bitch.
---
I don't think standard armor needs a nerf but instead that PA needs a buff.
---
Yep, haven't played in two months because of regular disconnects. I'll try again with the wasteland release in hopes they improve the situation. If not, uninstall.
---
It's a shame because I play almost entirely solo. Wish they'd just let you run it without a server in a solo mode.
---
*puts down glaming torch* awww
---
If you have the same rolls on your raid armor it is better though. I know, blah blah a hundred years to get the same rolls. But that isn't true, if you wait to mass craft several pieces on the same server you have a much higher chance to get the same rolls on different pieces
---
Except the PA is the best in the game, the extra damage its capable of is pretty substantial.
---
I have a full set of vanguards and the high capacity took about 60 dr off and a lil less er
---
Game didn't sell well initially (as evidenced by the price being slashed in half so early on).  As a result, the post release budget was surely reduced drastically.   
---
A studio that is kind of famous for releasing buggy games that get fixed by modders releases an online game where modability is more limited, it's a bad situation.  It's a wonder the game is fun to play at all or that most bugs do get fixed even if it often takes months.
---
I guess Im one of the few "smart ones" that didnt partake in the *mystery roll*....Im glad I dodged that bullet......
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you there
---
My guils compeltes this event pretty regularly (less so now with the stupid event timers) and we have never been able to get C past lvl 2. The plants seem to just stop spawning.
---
👍🏽
---
Only in 76, I’ve tried another that’s less then a month old. Same thing
---
&gt; dunno how it will be killing 12 million Scorched. 
---
12 million?  If the ratios are like the 1st challenge we'll have to kill 40 million to get the full goals.
---
make a post
---
Fully agree, we need a higher scrip amount
---
Same here.  I remember in my earlier levels, I was always out of stims, and would munch on whatever I could find to get some HP back.  Considering I was also broke, I would have loved to have seen a vendor selling healing salves for a nickel or so a pop.
---
Thanx for the info👍🏿
---
Yeah, cause I just love using broken op gear. Not. Till they bring in something to fight against the acid damage, I'm not interested in using game breaking gear.
---
I find blueprints are overpriced considering how easy they are to get I usually sell most of my blueprints for 50% the in game price
---
Aha! So the loading screen displays a random picture from my photo gallery. Thanks for that :)
---
Bonus for a successful event: Grafton's mayor goes offline for x number of hours afterwards
---
What's px?
---
Then go trigger it.
---
More than welcome to disagree with me. I'm okay with it. In my personal opinion it isn't worth my time or effort. It offers me nothing of interest.
---
The problem isn't the player limit of 1000 Scrip, the Problem is I need more than 150 a day to burn off the trash gear. I can easily spend 1000 and still have more gear to grab 500 from the machine and burn that too. The problem isn't greed...it's weight. Sales will not help, I need to get rid of more weight per day.
---
That’s for sure, people love to buy Handmades and 5.56.
---
It was 500 to 750 thousand before. That's an increase by half. So 4 million more right?
---
Yeah, but I dont use armor at all except to trade and make caps these days.
---
No, it was 100,000 for the 1st goal and 500,000 (i.e. five times) for the final stretch.
---
It's 8 million scorched for the first goal, if they keep the same multipliers it will be 40 million for the final stretch.
---
It's not a balance problem its an ungodly stability problem.
---
there are third party options to find people, a lfg system would be nice if you can’t find people though.
---
If I get close to the queen she usually detects me and it makes using my bloodied dcg bad
---
 Also with the fact that it seems lately that hits aren't being accounted for more often with melee than it used to so I've stopped using it for the time being, which really messes with my build alittle
---
Ah fuck yeah everybody should start selling your fucking Zealots weapons
---
At level 232 both seem like a 1 person job.
---
Go on Facebook. Stuff goes for absolutely outrageous prices on there.
---
They changed it so that you no longer drop junk if you die during an event, so that shouldn't be a concern any more.
---
Have my upvote
---
Wait, really? That sucks it cancels out I thought it would stack like most other things
---
I'm a unique type of raider.
---
 The only downside to a Lever Action is that it takes a while to reload. The Quad fixes that for a while. 
---
 Ammo I make and there is always plenty. I run a full auto Handmade as well. ;)
---
I know the feeling. Though, I’d had to face 2 lvl 30 mirelurk Kings. There was one time it was a 3* legendary lvl 30 Mirelurk king, but after dying repeatedly, I decided it was best to just log out and log back in.
---
It takes me like 4 seconds to complete Grafton Day.
---
Oh my god. You legend, i was gona make one of these myself but this is great.
---
we all know that....
---
Why should they if you don’t want teammates?
---
What u/Grim-Reefer123 said and also: there is a bug that sometimes displays your character's current level as 1 on the loading screen along with experience and ammo as zero when you load in JUST TO CONFUSE YOU.
---
What’s your agility?
---
Should of been here for the first meat week. Was the only time I unlocked and used travel agent. Seriously you're doing something wrong if fast travel is ruining your game play. Sell some shit yo.
---
This is really the best way to manage stash weight. I sell useful gear at a reasonable price so that I don't have to grind trash to sell to in game vendors. I keep maybe 25 of each scrap and buy whatever junk/chems I need from other players when needed. The only things I loot are legendaries.
---
I don’t think that was implemented yet. Though they did mention it a few ISTV’s ago.
---
Now if only amazon could deliver like this.
---
About the same level they are when they fast travel only to find 34 combat armor helms?
---
Welcome to Fallon's Department store!
---
That happens sometimes.
---
No, it was 100,000 for the initial goal:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/cm1RPKthQ75aMdF9dQY4m/fallout-76-project-clean-appalachia
---
&gt; Community Challenge – Clear the Skies (September 10 – September 23)
---
&gt;    Take down 100,000 Scorchbeasts with the community 
---
The 3rd stretch goal was 500,000.  We did over 600,000.
---
I guess you're misremembering 750,000 because that was the limit on the last progress bar they showed.
---
Thx
---
I think I was level 30 when I beat this I saved up missiles and mini nukes and went in all guns blazing with excavator power armour. Seemed to do the trick.
---
i think its just smart as a merchant to keep abreast of current game objectives and supply accordingly!  
---
besides, you would be helping everyone hit those goals for killing scorched by increasing effectiveness of our fellow wastelanders\~!
---
Thxdude
---
I think all your prices are sensible, OP, except that I don't think you should be selling your godrolls for just 5K.
---
For instance, everyone wants a damn bloodied handmade.  You don't need to sell that for less than 15K with so many people running around near the 30k cap limit all the time.
---
I would buy any max level 1 star bloodied handmade or 1 star bloodied gatling plasma I come across for 20k.
---
Now meat week has finished I'm kind of at a loss for end game content now. SBQs are rarer after that week ended and I was building for Survivor mode but hey, that's gone now.
---
Oh damn we didn't even kill 750k? We're fucked. Wastelanders gonna have to buy something out of my terminal then
---
What’s your gamertag
---
Yeah, I use it all the time to figure out what would be best with my build (non bloodied sniper).  I have a F FFR FR handmade and the chances of getting a fixer with that roll is so low I haven't even bothered to try.
---
Side note - I can build the fixer, no idea when I learned the plan but I did.  Probably found it in a vending machine, saw it wasn't learned, and bought it. :shrug:
---
So why are you here then?
---
Looking for a good handmade TSE since begginig. Never had a single one, neither by drop or vendors. I would pay 5k without even think. I’m on PS4. Sad face.
---
I mean, nonsense or surreal designs require one to desire to break immersion
---
I think it's 16-18 and that's only with 3 unyeilding pieces at the moment. My sneak is good against most things but the queen likes to kill me so fast when I get up close. I'm guessing that those extra 6 points from the other 2 pieces might boost me up and help out with the bloodied perks for agility but idk. I'm going to post my build later because I really need some help. I'm at a stand still because I don't know what to move around that would help / what perks don't help or are broken still
---
Haha thanks :)
---
Thank you!👍🏽
---
i have tried selling them for higher prices, but they just stagnate and sit there... once i realized lowering my prices actually moved product, i embraced it!
---
BUT, dont forget! the same god rolls i sell at my in game vendors for that low price, i also post online at the trading subs, and usually the trading subs get me a buyer super quick!
---
so basically i give a chance to in game people to get a great deal, but if someone on the subs offers me 15k i for sure accept!
---
What are these dungeons? 
---
I've stumbled across the scouts, the camp stuff and just started the moonshine. But dungeons?
---
Best power armor in game.
---
🤦🏾‍♂️
---
Thaaaank you, I figured it would at least be pretty meta and put a smile on a few people's faces. Problem is I didn't kill any scorched while I was tracking these down. I gotta play catch-up. I'm rocking a Zealots +power attack damage/+str Sheepsquatch Staff. Hope our ships come in soon
---
Same, I don’t want it damaging my precious Gears Edition Xbox lol, good to know it’s not just me with the issue though. Might make Beth look into it if it’s happening on a bigger scale
---
I don't think that's true. I reload faster on my. 50 cal with increased reload + speed demon than my. 50 cal without increased reload
---
So tune into the radio signal? That must be what I was missing
---
One of the reasons i uninstalled. People told me "its just one item!" when people were upset about the repair kits being added as the first non cosmetic item in the atom shop.
---
I was like "Its not going to stay just one item"
---
I was right. Im hoping it will improve.
---
i do have max caps on almost every character as i have 3 dedicated merchant characters, its just freeing to know you dont have to worry about the prices!
---
No!! I want to whine about not getting free rewards 😬
---
Im proud of you, son.
---
I get pissed when I get vendor-catfished with 30 non-legendary weapons. If it was zealot’s I’d at least be happy
---
agreed, its super frustrating how it randomly just decides to close the trading screen!
---
I don't have any more at the moment, but I'll save this post and get back to you if that changes.
---
Yes this exactly, good to know it’s not just me with the issue. Hopefully Beth look into it if it’s happening on a bigger scale. Thanks for your input on it 👍🏻
---
I couldn't agree more with everything you said. I hated that killing ghouls would bring you to #1 on the server so easily, so I was happy they removed it. They should have just removed PvE from effecting that, and instead of changing the damage per shot hit cap, made it damage per second.
---
5k is a deal on a god roll 3-star (FYI, Bloodied melee is the only melee where SS isn't necessary or even particularly desirable). Sometimes you'll even run into fire sales on decent 1- or 2-stars and junk 3-stars just because someone didn't feel like sitting around waiting for the scrip limit to reset at the machines and thought they could eke out a little more than a vendor would have given them; I scored a Vampire's SS Shishkebab for less than 200 caps a couple of weeks ago (as well as a few dud 3-stars that were all \~100 a pop just for the scrip from the same player). I also managed to nab a Suppressor's SS +1 AGL Death Tambo for 1250 yesterday to replace the Mutant's SS Meat Hook I've been using for months. Hoofing it or paying to fast travel to player vendors might be a chore and hassle, but you can find some decent deals a lot of times. Online listings through reddit are usually for custom order filling or misers seeking top dollar for great gear they found, so the cost is always out the nose. Some players will put good gear up for unreasonable prices and just wait it out, but frequently people realize that it's often a matter of opportunity and that not everyone who passes by is gonna have 20k caps at the time to drop on something, but will gladly fork over 1-5k for something nice.
---
I run semi auto rifle build, just hit level 90.
---
I stopped back in January. All I ever did was run scorch beasts and golf course to find legendaries.
---
Don't worry, we've already killed over 6 million scorched.
---
Where my experience happened was at the Charleston station, I was trying to get the traveling vendor bot to spawn. I walked over the bridge, came back, saw a guy throw down a frag mine and the insanity began. 
---
Also, there were a bunch of other people there as well, I'm not sure if they were all in a team or they just happened to be there like I did. And the guy doing the dupe yelled at me because I was crouched next to him while looking at him with a pair of binoculars, he must've been paranoid or something.
---
No. I run half health to have a chance in PvP. If it were nerfed, there'd be no point. How bout we buff other builds instead?
---
Here's the thing: a dungeon in Fallout is any interior that's got hostiles and loot. So we don't actually have dungeons. Like West Tek is technically a dungeon. So they're all pretty short, Arktos is just a bit bigger
---
What are caps?
---
Please please have someone build a basketball hoop at the bottom of the hill.
---
I just hope it doesn't brick my system.
---
That's what I's appreciates about yous
---
And yet I get downvotes. 😂
---
Uh, I never have to wait.
---
Makes me breathe a little easier, thanks
---
lol, anyways if you want to join in just shoot me a message
---
i agree with you totally!  I spend most of my gametime traveling to other merchants and scooping up deals and checking out how they price stuff
---
Yea 16-18 is too low, I said Unyielding doesn’t need sneak boost because Unyielding commando usually invest at least 12 (often 14-15) in agility. With Unyielding you should be at 30+ agility easily.
---
If you are running commando you can send to me if you like
---
Another call to make this game even easier... So lame
---
My Xbox is from 2014 the assassin creed black flag/unity bundle. I also stay in houses I rehab so it's hella dirty. I'm so fearful for the inevitable day coming that it crashes and doesn't come back. On a good note my Xbox has taken 5 years of un-optimal living conditions and is still kicking ass, so that bears the red ring of death.. 
---
Ps on and old person note, that Xbox bundle came with codes for the game instead of the actual game, which marked a first for me. I'm still upset about that lol
---
It was definitely implemented. I was leveling up my level 40ish alt during meat week, was dying constantly to the level 60+ yao gaui at the savage divide prime meat thing, and never lost my junk.
---
have tried the whole uninstalling and no improvement, it’s why I’m thinking that it must be something in the game and wanted to reach out to the rest of the community to see if it was just me or if others are having the same issue. Thank you though
---
I’m just joking but I’m on PS4 and have the full set of strangler already
---
https://youtu.be/JQ8jGqdE2iw
---
it is out there! keep looking! good luck!
---
difficult, but doable
---
Yeah - don't won't the DR but do want the stats ;-)
---
I like the Mex-X addiction suggestion - that gives me a backpack and some of the underarmor easily and can still peg at 0.
---
Only game that ever did that to me, besides fallout 76, was Ark Survival Evolved.. It's scary when it happens lol
---
I'm tempted to fill 3 vendors with low weight knives and hide them behind walls, with one vendor outside selling items people want but don't want to look for at camps.
---
yeah i imagine all those people who bought/traded for assasins sentinals pieces are kinda upset now
---
Side-note, welcome back brother. I was deployed in 15 when Fallout 4 came out so I feel ya!
---
I’ve never done the raids before in fear of my account getting deleted. Do you get a different plan each time you win the raid, or get duplicate plans?
---
Sounds like more fun than the raids.
---
that's awesome!!
---
Sure thing :) Thank you!
---
Semi auto isn't bad but commando is better dps wise. There is quite a bit of new stuff to do as well
---
The post was removed lol.
---
That was a rare glitch that has been taken care of and yes but only on standard and expert. No duplicates but you can fail to get a plan if your rng lands on a armor set you have completed.
---
ah, are getting existential today? 
---
what is love? baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me, no more...
---
That's basically my pricing scheme as well. Currently have an AAE combat shotty in my machine for 5k. A JE assault rifle for 3750. A quad assault rifle with crit damage and less AP cost for 2500.
---
No, it's will. You don't think companies should miss the chance for positive pr by making the goals difficult, do you?
---
I understand your style.  I run 260 with max capacity 370 before buffs from aid items.  I carry 40,000 5.56, 32,000 .45, and tons of aid items.  I only use PA for nuke zones.
---
I am having trouble getting my team through on anything other than novice.  We’ve completed novice a few times on each raid but always out of time on standard/expert.  Would love to get some training and tips from those able to complete this .  Starting to feel like my team doesn’t want to grind this anymore since we haven’t had a win yet on standard/expert.  Have 6-8 of us that play every night .  Everyone is adult- level 150+ - reasonably good gear/builds.  Usually on after 8p central for a few hours.  Gt: WinkMaster1 if anyone is willing to help out.  Thanks and have a great weekend!
---
Ah, a fellow 50 cal user, I see :)
---
What's wild is I used to sell at rock-bottom prices, and had trouble moving legendaries. Then about a month and a half ago, I doubled or tripled prices, and legendaries started flying out of my vendor. It's the Chivas Regal effect all over again.
---
Ok. I only have one character, so I can't compare. Good to know though. Thanks.
---
I'm the twirly Toy stash box tower guy on PC at Whitespring Station (around 400 toy stash boxes in 30 unit high helixes). Currently that character has moved his camp and isn't playing much anyway. But I like that people had fun with it.  
---
Got a tutorial from a guy who specialises in those under the map CAMPs but haven't tried making one myself. It was a total puzzle how to get into his CAMP but fun.
---
This is maybe better ;) 
---
https://youtu.be/pLsUL97oSRk
---
People have datamined some of the info on the halloween event in the game files, but I can't find any old threads about it. All I can remember is that it's mischief/trick-or-treating at the Whitesprings resort. Could change between now and when the event actually starts, though.
---
Ok I'll give it a shot. Thanks :)
---
I used to just give my high-value plans away for free. Now I charge half value at my CAMP (but would still give them away for free if you ask nicely).
---
Exactly haha
---
AWESOME HALLOWEEN COSTUMES AND MANNEQUINS TO PUT THEM ON OR WE RIOT!!!!!
---
BEHOLD PERRY THE PLATYPUS THE COWINATOR
---
What raids? :)
---
if you get a duplicate plan you will just not receive the plan.
---
Yes!!!!
---
Do you run with a team? You could always go the herd mentality route for +3 to all stats.
---
Hm, interesting. Idrk anymore because when I'm looking up perks for my new build, I see alot of forums talking about broken aspects of perk cards or gun effects and it's just got me confused lately
---
The only prices I take issue with is ammo. I don't buy plasma or fusion cores, so sell those for however much you'd like, but if your ballistic or energy ammo is over 1 cap, I won't buy and it is likely going to sit there for a while or indefinitely.
---
And if people want to sell their 1\* Nocturnal Pipe pistol for 2,000 caps, go ahead. It's only taking up space in their stash.
---
so because you dont want to find a team, Bethesda needs to give you the rewards for the only team based thing in the game? am i getting this right? 
---
how about we just give every player a full set of each armor and call it a day.
---
Balance was never the issue. It is just not a fun activity for most people. The server stability and poor performance were the main turn off for me. That, and the fact that you could loose all your gear.
---
k, have fun with that set lol
---
Yeah, one of my toons is bugged with that stupid message every time I log on too. I can never find the actual event going on so I haven't been able to do it to unbug it. They need to fix this.
---
Yes I know.
---
I just realised this 30min ago, do I erase the post?
---
That's a pretty neat idea, and then it's a funny wild goose chase finding your weapons
---
That's nice. Would have loved to have seen an attempt an Nirvana's 'Nevermind'.
---
Totally fair. Not trying to be rude or anything :) your info is still useful because it means all legacy ones can be used safely without rads, which is a great advantage
---
Your prices are fair, i come across trash 1 or 2 star weapons in vendors for 10k caps etc...
---
You put in 100s of hours and you're this angry at it?  It's time to move on.
---
LOL the truth
---
Good job and story bro👍🏻 next stop- solo the imposter 💪
---
on my character with a penchant for energy weapons, i regularly will buy ALL the fusion ammo if its 1 cap..... if its priced at 2 caps, i walk away!
---
Yeah the prices on those took their first hit with the effect NERF and now they're just fit for scrip really I suppose.
---
if your worried about the effects in PVP, if you're trying to defend against it, there is an easy way right now.
---
There is gear with +25 poison resistance.  So, since its already in game.  Where is your agruement?
---
Since only like .1% of players PVP, i dont see why this is an issue though.
---
its like if you buy cheap whisky and pour it into the crown royal bottle!
---
im glad you found success in your pricing!
---
MAYBE (&lt;- key word here) a reseller using a stolen credit card?
---
Lol thanks
---
It's on, didn't get damage just odd behaviour, maybe they were at max caps and wanted me to leave before I bought anything. They logged out after I left.
---
2 caps is usually what I put on healing salve, 6 for stimpacks. I only keep a few in my store so someone doesn't come and wipe out my inventory.
---
To block people like you
---
That has happened to me, it felt so real :)
---
These are the best things I've ever seen done in the game. Kudos on your dedication and effort.
---
If you don't have someone to brag about killing Sheepsquatch to irl then you need better friends, coworkers, family or gf.
---
You can't get explosive and FFR on the same weapon, and no one sells TS anymore... I think you're still in December, chief.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this.
---
I've decided to see if I can memorize it and repeat it even down to the inflection in his voice "Grrrraaaafton mayor here"
---
3 levels per day is perfectly doable. 5 at a stretch. My average hours per day are above 6. WTF am I doing with my life?
---
With this game you can't always be sure if it's a bug or a feature.
---
Not often, and yeah Herd and Empath + Strange in Numbers could be fun - but I team occasionally, not with a regular group.
---
Honestly I should find some non-invasive filthy casuals to just group with for the hell of it
---
System? I must have 30+  hours since meat week started and not a single disconnect or PA bug. No nuke launches personally but participated in at least 6.
---
My only real beef atm is the missing quest markers.
---
The issue for me, is I just don't give a flying molerats haory butt about the rewards. 
---
I do not wear PA, and not being able to craft/trade the armor pieces makes them a non-seller. No new weapons, no new CAMP plans, no new recipes, **I can't even craft armor sets for my alts.**. 
---
Seriously, wtf?
---
Those markets allow you to search for what you want and trade items directly... it's a much better experience than restricting yourself to vending machines.
---
\^\^ this. Stay away from fissures.
---
I've never seen it personally if you're on Xbox, but I have been there numerous times because rumor has it that it's supposed to be a good spawn location for the power fist puncturing mod, but I've never found it
---
I understood your predicament. 
---
I just think lots of people will join you when they cash in 1000 scrip for twice as many legendaries, and can only redeem 150 scrip-worth. Even if they scrip the heaviest things first, they'll still be overweight for days.
---
Someone fast travels to my camp: "90 weapons you say? All I can find is 3000 Bobby Pins, 17 White Wolf Fedoras, and a Zealots Wood right arm."
---
Now if they damaged walls ... WE COULD PLAY SEIGE
---
5 figure item isn't saying much, though. Most good weapons are worth over 20k.
---
It's got a LOT better. My average play time before a crash used to be 45 minutes. Can only remember one crash this week so far even on my wife's PC which is a lot more prone to these things.
---
this.  use something similar to hunter/hunted radio.  
---
Player joins, server wide announcement: player xyz is looking for a group to run Vault 94 on difficulty abc  
---
Other players tune into that radio frequency to join and can fast travel to vault 94 for free.   
---
Announcement ends and as soon as team leader enters the vault.
---
Didn't even know they wanted the Fedora but they leave happy
---
You are absolutely wright.
---
Cycling lights you can interact with each one to change the color or connect them all to eachother and then a terminal for 1 color on all of them
---
This is the best guide ive found.
---
Had it saved for ages as id love a megasloth or a deathclaw, but with all the reports of pets just random disappearing, im holding off until a later date

Ammo is used as a second form of caps! Start buying vendor 1:1 trades.
---
This is the definition of evil.
---
I like it.
---
Since TS isn't very good, and VATS cost is not really important on a grenade launcher, I'd say it's not very valuable. You can probably get a couple thousand caps for it, though.
---
I think the Sheepsquatch has a certain move that nerfs incoming damage.  When it roars and glows red, my melee seems to be about half as effective on it.
---
But it stands to reason that if you could get 6,000+ out of a single hit, the vast majority of things will die unless they have a lot of resistances.
---
I snorted my coffee laughing so hard at this.  Marvelous work.
---
Thanks :) too kind! A lot of friends help with materials, time, and ideas. I’ll always love 76 just because it’s fallout with friends, no matter the bugs haha
---
terrible moderators
---
I'm gonna say this for the last time you only need animal friend rank 3  for any tamable creature PERIOD! This isn't aimed at you i'm tired of people confusing poeple on this. They have changed the way you tame you can no longer just point your gun at the creature you have to walk up next to it for the "tame" to appear ..and it has to be an actual tamable creature to begin with.
---
Wow. Everyone did you wrong here. The SMG with -90% weight is heavy even when it's not modified. I get you now.

Irl money... Eww just eww.
---
I'm glad you aren't on PC lol.
---
The Pipe Revolver is definitely not overpriced, especially if it's a good 1st star effect.
---
I would like meet and shoot the person responsible. Just when I think I've gotten over the shame of being a middle-aged gamer someone comes along and makes me feel like I'm playing with a bunch of three year olds with their talking Buzz Lightyear toys. This has to be ironic right? I get the reference but every damn time you use your PA?
---
You could throw your friends I guess haha :)
---
The Messenger isn't part of the Public Events, although it's continued bugginess is an absolute fact.
---
Any attempts to combat inflation are futile and not worth the time or effort when the underlying resource is effectively infinite.
---
I can get behind this but have an idea why they won’t. Not sure if they can catch Dupes sold to the Purveyor but if not, the 150 cap slows mass conversion from Dupes to Legit Legendaries. I don’t have nearly as much to Scrip as you but still feeling the weight.
---
congrats, this was super awesome to read :) taking sheepsquatches is tough for me even now (level 200-something) quite an accomplishment!
---
for anyone else reading - you can get on the roof of the Welch station without Marsupial - jump on the barrel, then the low roof, then the high roof. sniping mole miners from up there is how I farmed all my black titanium for my first excavator set.
---
I have a Quad Ass Head that has 1 ammo in it's clip for some reason.
---
I try to think to myself, "what build is this for?" Most of the time, it's for a garbage build, and good for nothing, other than Scrip (although I wasn't aware of how many folks run a 'Junkies' build). I play for a couple hours after work, so I really rarely get god-tier weapons. In the end, the only weapons/armors I sell, are bloodied/unyielding, because I know people are looking for those. I'm the only one silly enough, to run Mutant Slayers.
---
I did, at one point, get a B.E. shotgun. It didn't fit my build, so I put it in my vendor for 10K, until I could build a character, not thinking anyone would buy it; but that's how my primary character reached his caps limit.
---
If that's how they acquired their gear, then they got what they deserve. 😋
---
i think....i love you!
---
so what are both afraid of?
---
IM AFRAID THAT YOU MIGHT LAUNCH MY COW!
---
Power armour definately needs some more relevant mods I agree with that. Especially the arms. 
---
Maybe normal armour is ok as it is, the only  thing that annoyed me Is when you get ambushed by somebody in full assassins armour and you can't so any damage.
---
well i stopped reading this after they said you needed wasteland whisperer you absolutely do not for any creature. The rest of the guide may be correct i'm not sure
---
Already have a TSE Fixer, Furious Explosive Fixer, Medics/Executioners are not explosive, Furious Explosive Fixer is by far my Favorite.
---
You've probably fucked yourself over several thousand caps, chief.
---
It's fine, I just suggested this to the entire community. Sharing is caring lol.
---
They want us to get the best rewards though so they'll set the stretch goals as we go along to be attainable. If they've any eye on publicity they wont want a thousand youtube videos and articles with titles like "FO76 population so low they can't even complete community events!1!!1!!"
---
Isn’t there also something about levels? For example. You can tame a level 21 death claw but not a level 80 death claw.
---
This is great! Also that song is super catchy ahaha
---
I don't think that's all that helpful. For things like cannibal I found it wasn't that bad to hop out of power armor for a minute once you've cleared a room out. Having to re-equip it every time would be extra-annoying though.

---
Whoaaaaa I love this!!
---
Uh, what? SS is almost always the most desired 2nd star effect, regardless of weapon, excluding V FAST weapons.
---
I think the timing needs to be adjusted greatly - at least for standard. 
---
There are too many problems w/ servers, etc. 
---
Leave aggressive time limits on the higher, but increase standard quite a bit - the rewards aren't as great - so I think that's workable ...
---
Exactly.  I have seen my reload change during play session to where I reload like lightening and reload like some 90 year old lady with arthritis.  Speed demon in general seems odd with its run and reload speed and the supposed caps/non stacking ness of this mutation.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
well it not so much that it's the fact that the random deathclaw spawn that is actually tamable just happens to be a lv 21 ...unless you get lucky and rng decides to make it scortched or a legendary then it can be a higher lvl
---
please posta  tutorial on how to build this, ive tried so many times fiddling with the launchers but i cant get them to work right\~!
---
its the dang connection point!
---
Nothing about pvp. Talking about how the damage effect of the acid lags folks out.
---
Well depending on the prefix that might be a good deal on that pipe revolver. I’d pay 11k for a BE one without a thought just because they are rare and some people utilize the pistol and rifle perks to make them crazy efficient.
---
What I found happens is, when the Queen is killed, the event is over, but the mobs still persist. At that very second, accidental PVP and loot dropping resumes, even though you're still in event mode. It's the only explanation that makes sense, because I've accidentally PVPed  during Scorched Earth, only to be told, that's impossible.
---
You missed out on a lot.  I used 2 repair kits and a scrap kit and killed the queen instantly.
---
i keep a mutant slayers melee on me for whitespring runs if my instigating one breaks!
---
They never claimed to have a perfectly running game in the first place.
---
I'm used to the regular spawns, I know what is normal. I get maybe one attack a day. I am in the forest region by the way. It's just these douchebags are hanging around in my camp, not really fighting, trying to get my camp destroyed. I can only surmise they're just bored high level players with no challenges left in the game trying to cause sh!t to amuse them.
---
You're prepared to spend 10k? Uh, those are worth *at least* 20k each...
---
&gt;I was right. Im hoping it will improve.
---
How would you even know?  You haven't been playing.
---
Yup that’s why you’re seeing a lot more posts about people griefing.  I’ve had more people randomly shoot me this week trying to start a fight than I’ve seen in the last 6 months.
---
You’ll also see people trying to find more griefing tactics like luring mobs to camps, workshop shenanigans, and post-event damage to start a fight.  Be sure you’ve got your passive setup on.
---
Watch out for the high capacity. You’ll get addicted to that extra carry weight
---
Since Scrap Kits, which really weren't that long ago, you haven't missed much.  I think it's just the Vault Raids.
---
well then, ive got some great swamp real estate you might be interested in!
---
I also sell bridges if you are ever in the market, and my friend the nigerian prince would love to give you a  call about an exciting investment opportunity!
---
I answered you with nice eBay link. 
---
Unfortunately it was removed. Reddit don't allow eBay links. 
---
Go and check yourself.  EBay handmade tse. 
---
If I'm messing with your business let me know, I will do I more often.
---
Ok I just had this happen last night and wanted to come back and share. I've long since completed Mayor for a Day and was in Watoga last night. I ran up over the wall and this assaultron just flattened me out of nowhere. I hadn't even fired a shot since loading in. Then I realized that the Dropped Connection event was running. The game automatically puts you in a psuedo team when doing events. One of the guys in the event had not done Mayor for a Day and so the bots all aggro'd on him. Because we were all part of the same team, they were aggro'd on all of us. Once the event was completed, all the bots went back to ignoring me and just focused on that one guy. Sometimes the game will also include you in an event without your knowledge. This is what happens when the trade bug has reared its head. The game thinks you are in an event which is why fast traveling to an active event and then coming back will often resolve the problem.
---
Are they actually going to add them or are you just hoping?
---
It has to be at a random spawn location. There’s a map that you can google search. Wasteland whisperer is absolutely useless. You only need animal friend to tame or pacify.
---
On the one hand I agree.  I'm fortunate in that I have a group to run with and I've already acquired 2 full sets of strangler PA.  
---
The balance is fine, it's a challenge to master each mission on expert the first time.  
---
The problem is the lag.  It's gotten to a point where we quit out and restart probably 75% of the time if the first area doesn't work correctly or if there's clear and obvious signs of lag like the initial terminal taking 5 minutes to load.  
---
If there was no lag, or if the raids were built in a way that minimized the lag, it would be fine.  Until then it's a huge pain in the ass server hopping to get a stable enough server to run expert.
---
There is no such thing as a perfectly running game lol. What an idiotic comment.
---
If you go out of the way to make this game Pay to Win for yourself, you don't deserve sympathy.
---
A BE Pipe Revolver will easily sell for 30k. Pipe Bolt and Revolver are affected by a wider range of perks, increasing their value by a decent amount.
---
It happens sometimes. But the camera from the tourist is a ‘ must have’ imo. And easy to get.
---
Sounds like some people going to be eating noodle bowls and steeped soot flower tea and living in rented refrigerator boxes for some time. Lol I read one guy spent 80$ US for completelymax durability plus 200% god roll automatic RR.
---
I'm not saying your wrong, just curious as to how you know for sure you have to get close to it to tame it? The reason I ask is because I have been trying for the last few days to tame a creature. I started out wanting a Deathclaw, but now I'll take whatever will let me tame it. I've tried all the "spawn locations " over and over. I've server hopped with still no luck. But I've never trying to get really close. I'm level 115 and have animal friend 3 and wasteland whisperer 3. So now that I see you saying you have to be close to them, which I haven't. Makes it feel like that's been the problem.
---
Level 80 easy.   or at the very least  lvl 45
---
Naw. None of them all. They could care less and still out farming folks, doing their competitions, and tweaking their builds like usual.
---
But that salt, that salt right there is why they keep fighting. Cause post like these are what feeds them.
---
Check the magazine
---
I’m not sure if it’s still a thing, but you can heal the friendly ghoul by shooting it with a gamma gun. Blew my mind first time I saw someone doing that.
---
You sir are a Genius.
---
Most of them are back in Adventure griefing and attacking random people. Survival will be back eventually. It will be interesting to see what happens with it though.
---
I mean... Like this? Ask people? Check forums? Patch notes?
---
Haha yeh i good really understand
---
i tame stuff all the time ...and getting close to a tamable creature wont be an issue because if it is indeed a tamable creature ....it wont attack you even if it has a red bar.
---
well ideally you would be loading up to troughs so that you dont have to protect bugs. Just getting them to level two is a big help.
---
I don't have a fraction of the problems you guys do so i don't know what to tell you.
---
I just wish starfield wasnt a thing. Fell like the company is so split up right now working on tonz of different things.
---
You can say what you want about smaller developers not having resources but one project at a time makes for some incredible games.
---
Took eso 2 years to be just ok and now 5 years later it's beast. Top contender for mmo so lets just hope they don't listen it idiots who cry on the internet and continue to hammer away at problems and adding the key features we all know it needs.
---
I’ll bet you keep a lot of razor grain and fertilizer on hand 😂
---
I don't think people dupe TSEs anymore, chief.
---
it got turned off because limb damage was being applied to everything. again.
---
Only ammo worth 1:1 is fusion cells and 5.56. Everything else is below cap value or worthless.
---
Cow did you do that??
---
ok ok ok, i just price checked them and Danny Tanner is right! i honestly was shocked!
---
thanks for the heads up! i was out of the loop on them!
---
Its time for you to move on.
---
if they are cheap enough to justify buying for scrip I'm cool :P
---
Oh ok. I wish I wouldn’t of logged on in the damn morning! Lol.
---
A few things I wouldn’t mind spending caps on:
---
Botstop. Let me rent a bot for a hours 
---
Train station multi character storage. 150c per hour
---
Haha that was satire.
---
I keep this sub on my front page to gauge if this game has met any standard of quality as far as loot and encounters.  All I see are Beth fuckups, crashing, messy encounters, crashing, and them making the game worse.
---
From a former player looking for a reason to come back it just seems like it is even more of a shit show than when I left.  So much wasted potential in 76.
---
Uh, thank you? And Danny Tanner is a Full House character.
---
i would keep both. Use the Action Hero as your main weapon and the other one for long range shots. If you think "why would i carry 2 50-cals?", i m carrying 3 right now 1 minigun and a MG42. I have a gun for every situation
---
Thank you! :) It’s Fats Domino - I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday
---
Auto 10mm ain't bad either for stealth tbh.  With the right perks you can empty 5 magazines into a guy and still be in caution
---
It's time for people who incessantly bitch about the game to quit playing it. This isn't me white knighting because the game is far from perfect but I dont understand how 6/10 posts here are so negative. I can't wrap my head around why so many people play a game they don't like.
---
Nah, not to me they're not. If someone out there can get it, and wants to wait on the buyer willing to pay that, then good on them. 2/3s of the possible in-game currency on a single item is too much for me on principle even though I have that much to spend.
---
So you haven't played New Vegas have you?
---
It used to be that way but it's been nefred hard. I have all of those sets and get melted when I use them.
---
The ability to bulk sell ammo would solve a lot of that problem. It's nice not having to go to reddit to sell it in bulk.
---
Lol I do love the witch hunting though. Those other guys there did nothing but look at the mines and were blamed as soon as someone else showed up. Twas goody Smith we saw dancing in the moonlight!
---
That is pretty rad.
---
Were all those participants... voluntary?
---
And stick around in a subreddit about it.
---
Tbh I have the pay to win Fridge ;) haha
---
yes they changed this a while back and wasn't mentioned at all in the patch notes but trust me i know 100% for sure
---
I would like to hit you up on this over the weekend. I’ve done it twice, but the group I was in failed both runs.
---
People don't have to wait, though. That's usually starting bid, and that's why you use multiple characters for caps. I don't think you're ever going to find what you want unless some poor ignorant player sells for cheap at a vending machine.
---
PS4 from what I understand doesn't. I don't know about PC. Xbox is lucky to have it
---
About 75% willing :)
---
yes this..well you do need whisperer to "pacify" certain things ( they changed this a few patches back)  but not to tame
---
Well who else are they going to tell all about it?!
---
While I agree that its sometimes hard to find a decent server to do Expert (cause time actually matters there), you can pretty much do Standart on any server no matter how laggy it is. Our group of 3 people has 12-18 minutes left on standart at the end of each mission, so therefore I assume doing standart is possible even as a duo, no matter what, and still have at least 5 minutes left at the end (even if lets say server lag eats up 2 minutes on door opening and announcements playing)
---
I regularly frequent the trading subreddit and while demand has taken a small hit it is still quite valuable and no one seems pissed off
---
I just wish they get to the point of the video... I’ll even watch the 30 second monetized video if they just get to the point without all the extra crap... 
---
I don’t want to see you wander around for 5 minutes picking locks or anything else...lol
---
.308, and .45 are often used.. .308 is more resource heavy than 556.
---
Alright, when I get on here in a little bit I'll definitely try it. And if I get a pet, I'll report back here with the good news. And thanks for the info, greatly appreciated.
---
buy plans from train station bots.
---
what system are you on I'm on xbox and will help anyone who needs it with finding a tame
---
If you have a friend or family with Xbox maybe login on their system? Just an idea...
---
So what are they? Do they involve grinding events over and over..?
---
Go to the trading subreddit
---
same as it ever was.. it's going to be some variation of bloodied
---
I’ll assume this was meant for me. Saying they owe us an apology is like saying the Founding US members owe us one because they didn’t solve American slavery.
---
Yeah, pretty fair  👍
---
I’ve been crashing within seconds upon loading into a world. PS4 here also.
---
Not compared to crouching. You can sprint, stand still faster.
---
It's the only situation where the mutation serves a purpose.
---
Going bloodied is kinda my thing. What weapons. I’ve got a character for every type.
---
I stopped playing at the wrong time
---
I can play with you and even help you join a community, the west virginian minutemen, I'm the commander the right hand of the general.
---
PSN ID: Weezunder
---
PS: I don't have a mic
---
hey a tip:  spawn in at abbys bunker go south down the road past the wendigos ..there is a random spawn just past them next to a (vw bus) this is my goto taming spot if nothing tamable is there relog and repeat
---
I'm fairly certain the Godd Howard himself apologized at E3 and said it hasn't gone the way they expected but it would turn around. Personal opinion, I'll take that over them just abandoning the project. Unless were due reparations. Then I want those too.
---
Is that a cowtapult or tremoochet?
---
Open up the construction, start building walls around them. Maybe have a premade sign you can hang that says "pricks not welcome".
---
Thanks, but as far as I'm aware (and have unlocked) there are only 4 magazine options, Medium, Large, Medium Quick Eject and Large Quick Eject. 
---
The Medium Quick Eject is lighter than the Medium, but I didn't think the defaults counted as mods. Perhaps that it, but I think I already scripped it, on account of it being terrible with or without -90RW, so I cannot test it until another one comes along.
---
Full health builds will be Vampires, Furious or TS
---
Bloodied builds will be bloodied.
---
secondary effect will be either +10% while aiming, or explosive.
---
Tertiary effect will usually be +250DR while reloading, FasterFireRate/SwingSpeed
---
Yeah turning in 1000 scrip is something I'll leave to youtubers....no way am I going to be carrying around 500lbs of garbage weapons that'll take two weeks to scrip back
---
Some are great for that. Some of the better ones (new Purveyor only drops, explosive, faster fire etc) are a little more expensive. Most are reaaaal cheap
---
Since this has become the darling of the FO community, everyone seems to look at NV through rose coloured glasses. 
---
No one seems to remember, legit hardcore bugs.... Like when you sent your companions to the casino.....and could NEVER get them back. 
---
It was the only FO/ES I traded back in within a week, and waited for a new patched edition to drop.
---
Thank you. But what weapons? Like handmade? Or minigun?
---
You’re able to solo vault 94?
---
and yes please let me know how it goes for you me and steve (my pet mirelurk king) are rooting for you .
---
then hmu, i’ve completed this raid multiple times on expert
---
I make 1350 a day selling 3x serums, which I make just to get rid of the extra flux from SBQ drops.
---
I feel like at this point I'm mostly offering a safe travel point in the NE. Not a lot of sales at Scrappalachia Pick-N-Save these days.
---
Bethesda has already acknowledged that they messed up. Watch the Bethesda E3 2019 showcase and see Todd talk about Fallout 76, I'm fairly certain he even said the word sorry. Todd has also said in multiple interviews that if he could go back he would do the BETA differently. If you've already seen these things then I'm not sure what more you're looking for from them, and if you haven't seen them, please inform yourself.
---
I've been playing for over 150-300 hours, but I do live in Cali so that's probably it
---
That actually seems kind of low for all of that, are you using rifleman perks?
---
have they tried removing all mutations, take off all armor, take addictol. then go get killed. then restart the game and get killed again?
---
i have found removing all mutations and armors and then getting killed seems to fix a weight carrying issue and other visual glitches.
---
and sorry not trying to be long winded but make sure when you are looking for the pet you leave the perk on while searching.I seem to find more tamble creatures vs trying to put the perk on when i actually find one.
---
Thank you. That's the pet I'm hoping to get actually wanted a Deathclaw but have recently changed my mind. One more question, where did you find him?
---
Yep. Happened to my Xbox one. Twice. Then it refused to boot. Had to replace the console. Probably a bad disk drive.
---
Have not tried that - Ill suggest it to him. Thank you for the info. I wondered if it could be a mutation glitch.
---
True. But they still are typically bought at below cap value.
---
Alright will definitely give this a try to, my camp used to be on the hill behind the Red Rocket.
---
Man you find chems and stims everywhere I don't carry more than 10 stims, and 4 radaway at a time and I'm constantly selling them to train station bots.
---
I got time, and I'm not a fan of mule accounts in general so I'm not going to use one. I've found one off a dead critter and one, as you said, for dirt cheap in a vendor. If I get three more and finish the set, great, and if not, that's fine too. I'm doing fine without.
---
at the spot i just mentioned  but be warned they spawn the least of the tamable creatures cept for like cats and dogs which are super rare
---
That’ll be 1800 Atoms
---
Mobile cowtapult? Haha
---
&gt; Do I message blast my server like a catfishing incel?  
---
I don't have an answer for you, but that made me laugh hard.
---
Wait till they figure out they can group up and kill people with radiation damage from fat mans even if pacifist mode is on... oops.
---
It does say on the website that they are going to change PvP up again for us without effecting people that dont want to do it. So hopefully its not a waste
---
Im sure theres a Standard or Short option for the Thompson.
---
If you find another thompson, have a look
---
It goes much slower solo ... you cant split jobs well.
---
it has to be some wild glitch if they are down 29 points of STR. when u say -14 that’s like whoa
---
Might be a dumb question but is this the only weapon you need to know the plans for to get? I’ve honestly only done 3 star armor rolls.
---
The highest I’ve priced and sold any item was a bloodied gauntlet with faster swing speed and +1 strength.   Made 8k caps on that one. 
---
I have a collection of handmades including an AAE and vampires and furious and BE.  I just got a stalkers handmade from the legendary purveyor and just about shit myself.  
---
Not sure I would sell any of them for something close to 25k.  Hell, I sold a nice AAE handmade a few months back for 2K caps.  I’ll openly admit that buyer got a bargain.  
---
I bought a quad railway rifle with FFR for 1k caps and was dancing in the streets especially after adding the auto piston receiver mod to it
---
Exactly. And it gets annoying testing perks out myself. Like one perk, I forgot what its called but it makes the explosive radius bigger. I would THINK that it would affect the weapon affects, but after looking it up it seems like it doesn't affect them at all. Which doesn't make much sense to me
---
A WEAPON TO SURPASS uhh....POWER ARMOR
---
Doesnt really seem very monkish, I'd do 15 strength and 15 endurance then some agility or intelligence and fill in the rest with what you need. Monks have iron fists and bodies, speed, and wisdom. But that just me
---
Ease up on that shift key, my guy.
---
People come to reddit looking for very specific pieces usually and are willing to pay more .. when im shopping vendors I am looking for surprises and good deals - if I wanted to play 15k for an armor piece id look to reddit not run around appalachia hoping to get lucky
---
The problem is how well it synergized with unyielding, adrenal reaction, and nerd rage. A slight neft to a couple things does seem somehow in order.
---
It's why I try to keep around 25K on me at any time.  I spend 2K to 3K just on the Queen and her spawns.  If I'm using my anti-robot .50 cal to launch the nuke, that number goes up...
---
BTW:  Lately I've been seeing less support for us .50 Cal users during a Queen fight.  For the last two that I participated in, I had to fight off the spawns and take on the Queen, despite me putting out much more damage than the lower level players.  When I started out, I was taught by a high level mentor to get my shots in on the Queen then help keep the spawns off of the guys with the big guns.
---
Meh I don't care. If I know em and i found them why should a charge 750 caps for a couch or 2k for a blueprint that spawn consistently (minigun)
---
I don't know so much about builds, but my recommendation is that you put 6-7 to intelligence because with that you'll be able to craft and fix almost everything, but it's just my opinion.
---
Your build, your rules.
---
Have a great day.

Absolutely not. If you want to be able to do cooperative content, you need to get out there and make friends. You need to get your build as good as it can be. The purpose of having a challenge is to overcome it. Once you start designing a game around giving everyone all the rewards; you get modern World of Warcraft.   
---
And this isn't coming from some elitist player. I haven't completed vault 94 or Arktos Pharma. It gives the world a sense of scale knowing that there are still challenges and rewards to obtain. If people can just go and easily solo these things, and everyone has a reward; why would I even covet that reward?   
---
Now here is the compromise; while you shouldn't be able to just get the high-end rewards from low difficulty/solo play, you should be able to work towards it over time. There should be a vendor or a challenge that you can grind out to unlock it. But that challenge should not be optimal compared to playing with people in this multiplayer game.
---
The fixer is already knocking the handmade off it's throne as king commando, which is why 5.56 was the currency. Save your .45s cause you'll be surprised when dupers get a hold of these fixers, suddenly no one will shake a stick at a handmade anymore.
---
I'm saying that charging a lot for plans that are actually rare, and not by in-game value, will allow you to buy a lot more of what you want.
---
That’s why I went with iron fist and punching weapons as the primary weapons skill. Working with what I can in the Fallout world.
---
Good guns: handmade, combat rifle, minigun, 50 cal, gatling plasma , plasma rifle, gatling gun, tesla rifle, railway rifle, 10mm smg, the fixer.
---
Good legendary effects: two shot, explosive, faster fire rate, less vats cost, furious, bloodied, executioners, vampires, faster reload
---
I know - the worst part is that his damage numbers go down to near nothing unless he drinks alcohol.
---
I've done it once. Went ok. Wasnt expecting the Assaultrons to show up and start beating us down for not leaving in a timely manner it seemed?
---
Have you noticed a difference with grenades even? I've tried that perk, and it does *not* seem like a 50% increase
---
I like your philosophy - anyone complaining about that price doesnt even understand what weapon they are looking at
---
Fetchez la vache!
---
no, all pa
---
Full health builds would be junkies, the ones you listed are terrible.
---
No one uses +250 dr reloading because it breaks the 1st effect.
---
You are experiencing the helpful but temporary bug. You are getting a boost that is not intended and fixes itself when you exit PA.
---
Its a known bug.
---
The 305 is your actual carry weight, but for whatever reason with Excavator, the set bonus is +200 on log in, instead of the proper +100
---
Standard or short magazine? It's not on the wikis I've checked, and if it's in-game than it's the only mod I haven't unlocked.
---
Lol dude, nobody would ever carry that much weight. The game is not realistic in this aspect. In real life you could carry a few hundred pounds but your storage would be unlimited because you would have unlimited space considering everyone else is dead besides mr. gutsy and other robots.
---
Some of my best purchases were from in game trading.  I got a vampire auto handmade with FFR and sweet Furious fire axe with SS for 500 caps total.   The guy was dumping gear and hooked me up because no one wanted to trade with him!!   It made my week.
---
I would think that a monk would have 15 charisma and I see him weilding a grenade launcher😁
---
I've beat NV 30+ times and never had that bug. That game is a masterpiece that put Bethesda to shame.
---
A single dlc has more original content than 76.
---
Freaking right!! Let's start the bidding at 10k
---
I’m not against the idea tbh
---
ive wanted to get into serum selling, but i figure most everyone has the mutations they want by now... but you are saying you sell them everyday still?   im glad to hear it!
---
No to matchmaking. That is not a social improvement. If you can leave a group and immediately find another then there is no social stakes to interaction.   
---
What you need is more reasons and ways to make friends through design.
---
I could support this, but there would have to be way more baddies, and the Grafton monster would need a HUGE buff. Most people of even middling levels can kill it with very little trouble.  
---
Really, they should just remove UF from the list. Especially until they implement the guaranteed boss loot
---
Beat me to it.  Take your upvote, you son of a silly person!
---
For full health ranged-builds, anti-armor generally outperforms furious. Two-shot has terrible accuracy penalties. 
---
Faster fire and Swing speed are second affixes. 
---
As noted by others, +250 DR while reloading is bugged.
---
I'm not sure about other categories, but for heavy weapons, I primarily use the .50 cal because:
---
* Ammo isn't too hard to craft.
---
* No spin-up time to fire.
---
* Decently accurate.
---
However, I still use many of the others just because they are fun to use and not too far behind in damage.  Minigun, ultracite gatling laser, and plasma gatling are all very close to the .50 cal in damage, but the spin-up time makes it frustrating to fight melee enemies that interrupt your fire. However, using different weapons means I can stockpile different ammo types like fusion/plasma cores and 5mm.
---
I use a variety of the other heavy weapons too, but the others all feel like they have some drawbacks:
---
* Flamer does good damage, but it chews through ammo/durability rapidly.
---
* Gatling gun is good for picking off weak or distant enemies and conserving ammo, but I don't think its raw dps is as high as the other faster firing weapons.
---
* Missile launcher, fat man, auto grenade launcher are fun to use, but only really worth it on tightly packed groups of enemies.  Also the ammo is heavy/expensive.
---
* Harpoon gun/broadsider fire/reload too slowly to feel useful to me.  I don't even bother with these.
---
I’ll try and join you tonight. 
---
GT is Hawkeye PCS
---
Balance? The problem is it's boring, the rewards are shit and it has a chance of deleting your character.
---
No time to explain. I’m busy crafting 10k rounds to get through one raid.
---
I appreciate that you are feeding the hungry with the best ribeye steaks around. Medium rare for me please.
---
28% dmg? this is absolutely wrong. It's just 28% armor penetration instead 50% if using stabilized. it's roughly 10% dmg boost. Or less.
---
I'm sure when I see the option to tame. I'm gonna hit tame and be happy with my new possum. Lol
---
lol, nice.  A unique legendary lvl 50 drill with vampires + bleed damage ftw :)
---
That's what I'm talking about! :) Grats on the new toys!! :)
---
Holy moly, I didn't expect anyone from Bethesda to see this! I'm glad you like it!
---
I see people popping in here and there to bitch about 76 being trash.
---
I was watching a streamer last night, unrelated to 76, but the subject came up when the streamer seriously asked about the game.  Someone chimed in, several times, about how it was a shit show and how he's hate himself for playing it.
---
I asked the guy bitching how many hours he had into the game.  He didn't speak up once after that.  Not sure if he just left or if he couldn't bother to lie about it.  The conversation went on normally after that, pretty sure the streamer is convinced to give it a try.
---
They should have fixed vfast months ago. I gave up on ever having a chainsaw worth using.
---
there does not need to be a time adjustment for standard on dead in the water, you can get up to 20 minutes for the end room if you get all the pipes, meltdown in the other hand definitely needs adjustments on standard and expert, and the last mission just needs less rng.
---
All of them. But beware, it has comically large helmet...
---
The top rifles right now are the handmade and "The Fixer". The Fixer is a variant of the combat rifle that only drops from the purveyor if you have learned the fixer plan from the Encryptid event. Commando (full-auto) variants are generally stronger than rifleman (semi-auto) builds. 
---
For heavy weapons, look at the .50 cal for the best balance between power and ammo consumption. 
---
The minigun is weak and has an annoyingly slow spin-up. It should generally be avoided. I have a furious faster fire minigun and it still underperforms relative to other heavy weapons. 
---
Melee is also in a good place. There are lots of options there.   
---
I'm not really clear on what you're going for here though? What's your goal?
---
I would use it lol. Drilling ghouls all day, with the weapon I mean 🤔.
---
You could finish free range in record time.
---
some guns come with mods already attached.  Try dropping it down to "standard" and you might get teh weight down.  
---
But yes, 90% rw is borked and mods are way too heavy.  Will Bethesda ever change it?  Who knows.  Maybe when private servers come out we can mod them to sane weights.
---
notes to not listen to crybabies.
---
Wondering about that. Had 900 scrip saved up and.. Nothing...
---
really?  I have had nothing but positive experiences with my +250DR Vampires Explosive CRif.
---
must do some testing when I get back home tonight.
---
That would be broken op.
---
Honestly? I don't notice much. I wanna get the second rank and see if it's that much bigger, but maybe the perk itself doesn't work and that's why. From what I've gathered from Reddit, it doesn't work with any explosive weapon and only grenades. Which seems alittle pointless, in a way.
---
the deletion glitch has a theory on how it works, the rewards ARE the best in the game, for me at least.
---
Nice succinct list. I'd remove the mini-gun. I wish it were stronger, but I don't think it is. I'd add anti-armor, instigating, junkies and quad to the list of good legendary effects.
---
For rifles, Handmade or Combat Rifle.  
---
For heavies, Legacy Explosive Gatling Plasma.
---
If you dont have 100k in trades laying around, 50 cal or minigun
---
Melee unarmed would be DCG (unstopable monster if you were lucky in survival), Meat Hook, or Power Fist
---
Melee Armed would be just about anything, though most go for 2 handers (I use a bone club)
---
" I only keep a few in my store so someone doesn't come and wipe out my inventory.  "
---
this is a good technique, good call, some people will try to buy them all then flip them at their vendors, negating your attempt at goodwill!
---
You want a list of the required ingredients for each thing you can make? I don't have one, but perhaps that might help others understand.
---
does anyone feel location makes an impact on asking price?  my isolated camp gets few visitors, but its in a high level area so i figure players around there will have more caps generally.  the vendors are more like a giftshop attached to workstation camp
---
also, i only sell magazines (@99), bobbleheads(@199), and nuka quantam(@9).  i dont put any armor/clothing or weapons for fear someone might FT travel to browse thru my collection of asylum worker hats.  i know they're overpriced, (esp considering how buying/trading dosent count for cheevos)
---
Are you saying you think emergency protocols is stronger than legendary armor? Emergency Protocols does t even come close to many legendary effects as stated in the title.
---
Never bought anything with cash, but yeah I am a bit salty that all the gear I grinded for and hunted down mods for (thank you pve player vendors) was a waste of time. But even more then the wasted time and effort I am the most butthurt about not being able to enjoy the gear I worked for anymore.
---
Oh well, at least you guys got a whole game just for you. Enjoy grinding for gear so you can kill mole rats faster.
---
you did the same thing I did and forgot AA.  which is better than anything save bloodied.
---
send me a msg on xbox and i’ll invite you to a party
---
Do what de did when we were nine and played NES: just play a different game. Flawed and all, we continue playing because it is a great game with tons of problems, but a great game still, with a great world and a great proposal to the player.
---
Check nukacrypt.com
---
It's never enough.  People like this would demand more and more.  This isnt about redemption, it's about the feelings of the OP being validated.
---
I’ve just typed in the code twice and it was wrong
---
Fallout.fandom.com lists it as " Standard Magazine "
---
PA is great for pvp which no longer exists and crashes the game if you go too high rof. 
---
Solar and thorn effects are weak and don't compare to a full set of 3☆.
---
Grinding to get a 1/10000 piece 5 times would take longer than you will be alive.
---
No it isn't. AA is trash with stabilized. The armor penetration values DON'T add up to 95%
---
It should be like the Ripper. Same with chainsaws. It's hard to balance, but I would love for my shovel to hit harder than a walking Cane. It should, really.
---
someone told me that its hands take too much space when using heavy guns so they stopped using it, there's that.
---
That sucks to hear...the code's been out since monday tho
---
Thanks but which property can drop to standard? The only lighter options I see is the medium quick eject. There might be another lighter option, but there's one mod I don't have unlocked. 
---
I might need to scrap some SMGs for science.
---
After the original release or the last patch?
---
I can get a good run out of one with the melee duration perk and luck of the draw.
---
I know I’ve even checked websites and it hasn’t worked
---
Reminds me of the cow launcher from South Park n64. Great stuff.
---
I think Bethesda needs to make you into a NPC in their next game as the one who launches cattle.   
---
Quest: "When Cows Fly"
---
Description: Ol crazy Kazamati is having a dispute with the local neighbors regarding the amount of cows around their house. Time to send the neighbors a nice 900lb non-cooked beef gift basket from the sky.
---
Quality. Content. This is it.
---
Finally, some love for the artillery!!  Cattle away!  Fire the cowtillery!
---
I read the title and knew it was you. You crazy bastard. Will stop and check it, as usual.
---
Try 17189221
---
That worked thx
---
I spend way too much money on plans.
---
No worries.
---
Enjoy your nuke :)
---
I have a furious +25% fire rate minigun that shreds pretty hard.  Seems to do just as well as my furious +25% fire rate .50 cal, just uses more ammo.  I think the key is to get the tri-barrel mod which increases the damage per shot which helps it to penetrate armor better and also reduces its thirst for bullets a bit.  The accuracy increase is also nice for picking off far away targets.
---
It's a known bug which I find very useful. If you are a good way from any kind of benches to scrap stuff and you become overencumbered in your Excavator by a good bit (but no more than 100 of your normal carryweight)  jump servers and the bug will kick in allowing you to fast travel to somewhere where you can scrap. But you lose it once you step out. I do this regularly. Or alternatively I drink a nukashine , see where I end up and hope it's not too far from somewhere with workbenches. This can be great fun and I've discovered lots of unusual places doing this that I might not have discovered.
---
Yeah, with double radius they may be useful, but I just tested it with plasma grenades, and at max grenadier, there no discernible distance increase
---
Moobile cowtapult
---
i don't recall, if you can craft one do that and then swap the legendary to whatever mods the base one has.
---
This is conjecture, mind you.  I wouldn't be surprised if it just doesn't work like half the stuff in this and all other Bethesda games :P
---
Anti-Armor only amounts to about +29% more damage. It's actually not the best in terms of overall damage (I still prefer it to Two-Shot since it doesn't have the accuracy penalties). 
---
Junkie's maxes out at +50% damage, and you don't need to constantly use chems - addictions are permanent until cured, and it's easy to find five addictions that don't impact your gameplay too much. It's the best legendary effect for raw damage, for anyone unwilling to build around Bloodied.
---
Nope, I did not say that.  Please don't put words in my mouth ;)
---
I think it's kinda BS that we not only have a 1000 scrip cap, but also a 150 per day cap. It's just annoying. And that when you use scrip it doesn't partially refill the daily scrip is also annoying. Here I am with 3\* weapons clogging my inventory when I just wanna pull the slot handle again. I NEED MY FIX DAMMIT.
---
I grok beauty.
---
This is beauty.
---
i think you are right, players with access to higher levels should theoretically  have more caps
---
i think a central location like top of the world or whitespring is probably the best vendor location
---
and if you have the capability to move your camp on the fly, always move it to coincide with events like during meat week im sure you noticed alot of vendors set up righ tnewar the meat week staging area
---
I want to stop playing.. I think it’s maybe time I take a break.. I just haven’t been this addicted to and invested into a game since I’ve was 11 and discovered runescape.. 😭 I’ve been top 500 in Overwatch.. played mlg ladders with friends in multiple call of duty’s.. even played competitive smash for a while.. I’ve been around the block when it comes to gaming.. but no game since I was a child has captivated me like 76 has.. this is why I am so angry towards the tragedy that is this games development.. 😭😭
---
For real.
---
See the curator at the fort, accept the quest, and then turn it off in your PipBoy. 
---
Resume normal activities.
---
Wow, that is AMAZING!!
---
I guess you had found the cap-pinchers paradise for moment.
---
I was holding it together until I saw you wearing the Evil Knievel helmet giving a thumbs up.
---
I am now Ded.  In lieu of flowers please send ribeye steak.
---
Animal food trough wiper!
---
This is a good list, but to expand on this a bit: not all legendary effects are good on all weapons.  Vats is worthless on most heavy weapons.  Furious is not good on slow/single shot weapons.  Instigating (which isn't in your list) isn't good on low damage weapons.  Also, a lot of people seem to like two shot, but I find the accuracy penalty to be pretty annoying on most weapons so that takes it down a notch IMO.
---
Yes, that's one of the two things I'm looking for. And if it doesn't exist, one of the things I'm suggesting. From what I've seen available from vendors in the game lately, it would be a massive list already if it was made and complete today - but perhaps still worth the effort for a number of players to use.
---
Totally agree I got killed by a  level 1 ghoul in Flat Woods the other day. People only see the damage you can do with a Bloodied Build but no one knows how scary a few Mole Rats can be to a Bloodied Build when they suddenly appear from underground.
---
Off topic, but i always remember my first Nukashine black out.
---
Was level 25 or so, and ended up in one of the monorail trains in the cranberry bog!
---
I looked out the windows, saw a scorchbeast and noped out of there 😂
---
Oh they aren’t new toys.  Got them earlier in the game and as a lvl 50 ish player it was awesome.
---
I ain't going anywhere joker
---
Bethesda don’t want us to have too much fun remember.. we have to spend hours grinding and our hard earned money if we want cool things in this game smile
---
Very true
---
I like it with my Gatling gun. Does take up a bit more with a .50 cal.
---
I made 100k in 3 days just by pricing weapons reasonably and pricing endgame rare plans really high. Power armor plans can be sold over 10k.  The fixer plans at 10k.  Bloodied explosive anything at 5-20k.  Any reasonable handmade or good heavy gun at 12k+.  Armors are only valuable with uny/sent/cav/detect, otherwise sell them at scrip value.
---
Enough people have nothing left to aquire aside from rare plans and ultra-rare outfits and a god roll or legacy that they will pay exorbitant amounts for it.  But you'll turn just as much profit making quick scrip sales.  Stock the vendors with at least 20 weapons and be near whitesprings or east of it, you'll get lots of traffic.
---
Thanks! I agree with you 👍
---
Once someone has sent an invite, press the Options button on the controller; it'll bring up their name, and should have the options of whether to accept or decline, or you may have to press X then accept or decline will show up.
---
What about European standard? I’m feeling left out.....
---
It's not the durability that's the issue.
---
The damage is terrible even at it's peak.
---
The lvl 45 bloodied ss buzzblade is the best possible vfast weapon and it struggles to kill enemies that are a one shot with other comparable weapons.
---
Great for clearing trash mobs, terrible at tough enemies.
---
Tickles them long enough for you to get punted into orbit.
---
You don't think you can make more friends if you just play more? All the friends I play this game with are people I've met on the game. That's not really an excuse. It's not Bethesda's fault you can't find friends to play with...
---
My psn is Silkrush; I'm sending  a friend request
---
Even if there isn't a mod called standard for it, the game may be calculating the 90% weight loss as though there is one so you possibly can't get the weight down.
---
I have a 90% reduced weight LMG that weighs 8.8 versus a non reduced weight of 16.The mods for that gun are all standard with no options but the game still calculates it as though they are upgraded mods above standard.
---
Why is this the only kind of shit you respond to?
---
My instigating plus 10% damage handmade outshines both my TSE and AAE handmades.
---
It can proc on each trigger pull so more useful for semi auto. It still get some ok use on guerilla or comando.
---
Oddly I found that lvl 1 proc the most. Probably cause of how much it repairs. So lvl3 would rarely proc but it would fix a lot. Rather have small repairs often but that's me.
---
Don't know if it can go over 100%. Worth a test for sure.
---
Thanks! Keeping the quest never occurred to me.
---
My first I had no idea what was going on. Thought my game was crashing 😂😂 ended up in trappers camp in savage divide. About LVL 14 and hadn't gone further than the forest. Was overencumbered at the time too. Terrifying and brilliant experience all at the same time trying to get back up north to safety. And that's how I became an nukaholic 😂😂 unlocked a good half ot the map by getting wasted after that
---
I agree with you man. I've met all the people I play with by uh... playing the game. People are just whining because they play casually but want the best loot in the game.
---
Heavy: 50-cal for sheer joy-of-fuck-you-mutant, Gatling for windy-windy-but-I-make-less-ammo. LMG for woah-lol-this-thing-fires-fast-haha but omg ammo.
---
Rifles: Fixer then handmade. They're close to each other, but nothing else is close to them. Lever action is worthy if you're sneak, but then you should prob be Fixer.
---
Pistols: Who knows, who cares. (sorry, it's just broken, and I really want a Buster Scruggs toon. Colour me salty). OK fine, it's 10mm SMG auto. Probably. Or not.
---
Melee 1-h: DCG, Mole miner gaunt or power fist. Swing speed or PA damage are both good. If not bloodied, I suggest swing speed.
---
Melee 2-h: Super Sledge, Grognak's Axe, Sheepsquatch club, maybe bone club. Same deal for secondary as 1-h.
---
Melee special: Meathook. This will typically be bloodied, but works great with nearly any mod, if you're OK to spend the points. SS or PA damage is almost irrelevant but SS is the meme. (they're maybe relevant with highly-specialised builds)
---
Metas are Bloodied (low health), Junkie's (can play low or high).
---
Other options are two-shot (full health), vampires (very full health, I love this one with Vanguard, such a pity about damage, but it's playable), Furious (should go one of the others), Instigating (sniper - actually really good).
---
Secondaries: The interesting bit. Explosive is the meme one here, but actually unless you need the AoE it just costs 4-8 perks (fireproof and demo expert). 25% FFR is beautiful with an auto weapon, and beats explosive for DPS (no perks needed). 10% aiming is underrated for certain, I love this bunny. Swing speed or PA damage on a melee...well....does it die in one hit? Then it doesn't matter. Does it not? Then swing speed. Who the hell power attacks all the time?
---
Tertiaries: 250 DR reloading is broken. Sorry, just is. Doesn't work. Maybe they'll fix it and it'll be nice. Reload speed on heavies or rifles is GOD here. Especially on heavies. 90% weight reduction can be amazing too, especially for rifles, as we have no perk to deal with this. For melee, I guess strength maybe? the weight redux one seems silly (they're all so light), and the blocking one is....well, do YOU block?
---
Hope this helps, sorry for War and Peace :)
---
my Ferenghi training in the rules of acquisition dictate this behavior
---
Which one?  I have an AAE Gatling Plasma, AAE handmade, AAE combat rifle.  I had a nice AAE combat shotgun but sold it a month ago.  
---
I like the AA weapons but am a bigger fan of furious and bloodied and vampires designation. Tank Killer or Stabilized perks can provide a decent AA effect.
---
Lol I guess it's better than adults on segways.
---
Ita nor super rare and it doesn't have to be a full set or even those exact ones. Legendary armor is stronger than a single PA mod either way. Even just the chest peice is comparable.
---
You're asking for too much, Bethesda doesn't play this game, I'm not even sure Bethesda knows this game exists.
---
A happy anomaly then lol hopefully they patch it overall
---
I sold a bloodied 1 star 50 cal for 1000 in about 5 hours of game time, I expected I would have to cut it back to 500 or less to sell at all.
---
But I'm keeping my Anti-armor, weightless, and who cares handmade rifle.  That's my new baby
---
Are you on PS4
---
I would pay 2000 atoms for this
---
Don’t wish that.
---
Stocks won't clear themselves !
---
You can get the camera without finishing the bucket list. I had used the camera for about 70 levels before I finally finished the quest to get the zoom lens.
---
As for the op someday you can finish those quests theres no rush. I hit 118 and I'm thinking about finally heading to top of the world. Distractions are always part of the fallout experience for me.
---
Ya BOI!
---
I hate when I forget to equip ammo smith or super duper then craft a bunch of ammo.
---
Some people try using gatling guns for crit sniping but it's still more of a novelty gun with the AP consumption. I had a bloodied 50% crit gatling for a while.
---
Top tier prizes should be in the hardest level but you do t have to be condescending about it. 
---
I'm not about micro analyzing a game. Hell, filthy causal is in my game tag, but that doesnt mean that NOVICE should have a descent reward.  Maybe even a few plans that if you want the while set, you gotta step up expert. Give em a taste as it were. 
---
And yeah, timers suck, but if the "lore" or the mission calls for it (fix the thing before it vaporized the vault or whatever) then therr should be a count down.
---
Will get on this weekend, sent you a friend request, haven’t done the vault yet so it would be fun.
---
You're too low level for that area. Unless you're perked into sneak and can bypass everything, you're probably either going to have to get some levels or bring some friends.   
---
One thing about 76 that can be rather frustrating at early levels is the quest design is not that great. Ideally you would FULLY explore every area you find before moving on with the quests, as that's pretty much the only way to level enough to be the right level for each area. But the game doesn't really tell you to do that, so people area always trying to do stuff they're just not ready for. I would recommend ignoring that quest for a while, and just explore every little bit of the Forest, the Toxic Valley and the Ash Heap before venturing into the Savage Divide. You'll find lots of neat areas and learn more lore this way, too.   
---
Another thing, if you scrap and stash your junk, death doesn't really matter. So if you go somewhere that you're dying a lot, you CAN do these areas, it'll just be more time consuming and frustrating, but you'll probably get through eventually.
---
there r a coupla reasons the raid(s) have been a bust for me.  not the least of which is that i still couldn't in good conscience tell my friends to buy this game at that point.  tried v94 2 times, and even then, only on the first week it came out.  (1st time got frustrated, left; 2nd time disconnected, never returned)
---
\-couldn't sit and read a terminal at my own pace before some mirelurk or cricket would start chewing me up.  this problem has been mostly fixed around the world, but i encountered it again in 94.
---
\-whole single-player vs 4-player debate.  i am very curious as to who the larger playerbase for this game is, and moreover, which playerbase will play this game longer and/or sustain it in the long-term.  (do whales travel in packs?)\*  obviously hazarding a guess would be wanton speculation, but beth has to know what the numbers truly are.  in ESO, there are tons of quests/events/raids etc that ill probably never complete, but b/c there is so much other material i don't feel too bummed out about it.  fo76 does not offer a similar palliative at this time.
---
\-the raids sound boring.  idk if fallout wants to be a grindy looter-shooter, but right now its just too janky to really lean into this philosophy.  so adding shortcut design difficulty (eg timers) just sours the experience.  someone made a reddit thread about having funny or unique quest goals, so for example they mentioned feeding a mirelurk that will open a door for you.  additionally, i'm not sure if these promote a diversity of roles/loadouts or force players into certain styles/weapons which is always a PITA to change.
---
\-hell is other people
---
\-finally, can anyone confirm that you can buy/trade/sell plans?  from what i understand, they are using the atomshop infrastructure to issue these rewards which make them non-transferable.   as a sub-optimal/food/junker build really dont stand much of a chance of completing the raid, but i would be interested in buying plans for them.  im paying (the opportunity cost of enjoying aspects of the game i like) vs 9000 caps, whichever is lower
---
\*they travel in 'pods.'
---
Someone was just fucking with you and you took it as a sincere response so maybe this isn't the best method.
---
I'll play the flip side. We also get mounds of free dlc, atoms and few atom shop icons lol.
---
Incorrect.
---
I literally have no idea what I'm doing in this event. I apologize to the people I'm in it with. I kill the things that are attacking me.
---
Yep, until you increase your health.
---
If novice doesnt need plans and is for kearning time limit should be removed then cant learn the vault if i keep gettin time kicked from it
---
She responds to people having technical issues and suggestions as well. Really depends on the day.
---
Novice gives you a little steel which is more than enough. Novice is not the raid. It’s practice. Standard and expert should be only things with plans.
---
Those ghouls better not be miners or you goin to jailol
---
I agree to a point, but these are mostly novelty items. I cant imagine someone swinging a cane or a shovel on the sbq.
---
FWIW dragons were pretty popular PVP weapons when the game was first out because you could one shot other players.
---
Once one-shot builds got nerfed they became more or less useless. I have a BE dragon and while it’s fun to use it breaks in like 7 shots so it’s not really worth carrying around.
---
Exactly. It’s a shame
---
Awesome thanks. I only have one unyielding peice atm but definitely going to get more now. Thank you
---
Are you guys ever planning on fixing the responders shotgun paint glitch? If you put it on a 3 star shotgun, it sometimes removes the stars, particularly the second effect. It can remove explosive from 3 stars explosive shotguns. I want it on my two shot explosive pump
---
Yep, it has some serious issues in fpv.
---
Whoa. Chill
---
I prefer the glowing ones.
---
I killed a guy with a bounty last night and accidentally picked up his loot as I was trying to drop a stimpak for him, so I had to chase him down and spam the gift emote so he could see I was giving his loot back. He threw a heart and me and we went out ways, I'm glad there are so many cool people still.
---
Just "we're aware"...........
---
Yes, killing every workshop owner in sight and make the toxic PVE ppl cry.
---
Especially as I’ve gotten most of my 2* vanguards Combat Armor, heavy and sturdy, from vendors
---
One of my toons is lvl 92 and Im just getting around the Responders questline with her....
---
Im fat from cssual and unless m missing something some crappy power armor plans and chance at a legendary is far from best loot in the game
---
This is the real endgame
---
Simply outstanding Sir!
---
Definitely not. I’m running an Xbox one X on gb speed internet. Definitely THEIR system, I.e. server instability but not mine. that’s the thing with server instability though, it’s not consistent for everyone - hence it being unstable. I’ll have days were absolutely nothing will go wrong and days where the game plays like pubg did when it was first released for Xbox.
---
Amazing.. Bravo.
---
On the way haha :)
---
I would prefer an atom store alternative to hacking ini files
---
Bloodied caps at +95% when at 5% health.
---
👋🏻
---
Ouch - thought I had something :)
---
I mean, if you seek the darkness and cynicism, you will find it.
---
Hopefully that made sense. I'm not used to speaking in hippy bullshit.
---
And Ive never experienced half the bugs or server issues people complain about with 76. So what does that tell you?
---
Yeah, I like to think for every asshole in the game there’s at least like 5 kindhearted folks just trying to play the game like everyone else.
---
I will join.... never been on an xbox party or on a 76 team.     Will ping you when online
---
Reload speed is not cancelled out by speed demon. Try it.
---
Well designing difficulty around time limits and constantly spawning mobs seems lazy to me
---
In my new Vegas playthrough back in the day an entire large region the map got bugged and you would fall through the ground if you went there.
---
yes, i am now schooled on explosive pipe revolvers! i had no clue they were so sought after!
---
The fundamental problem with vfast weapons is the way the armor calculation affects damage.  For those that don't know, increasing your damage per shot also makes your shot penetrate more armor.  This means if your gun does say 50 damage and you get a mod that does +10, you may find you actually get +12 due to penetrating more armor now (not exact numbers).
---
This means that weapons that hit for low damage very quickly are more greatly affected by armor than those with lower rate of fire and higher damage.  So, even if the theoretical dps is the same, the lower rate of fire weapon will have higher dps in actuality (unless the target has 0 armor).  This is the main reason all vfast weapons suck and the only way to really fix it would be to change the armor calculation (or buff the weapon damage to obscene levels).
---
This is also why things like low HP builds are top damage.  The combined effects like bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction boost your damage per shot to very high levels, and the armor calculation means they also penetrate more armor as well, leading to even more damage!  This can also explain why Instigating seems to add more than double damage to your weapon.
---
That is exactly what happend to me. It was just after the Queen was killed and a Mirelurk King packed my shit back in. Then a level ~400 took all my components. Just seemed a bit cheap, I doubt they needed the screws and stuff as much as I did. :(
---
I'd like to take you up too! Gt is ju1c3itup
---
Here's what's been found. Spoilers ahead:
---
&gt;!Name: Mischief Week
---
Led by: An eyebot named JES-2R (get it? Jester.)
---
Objectives:  Kill Whitespring Robots, Blow up cars, light bonfires, graffiti walls, trick-or-treat, and fork lawns. !&lt;
---
Thank you so much! Greatly appreciated!
---
Reminds me of the time i put my bloodied explosive harpoon gun up for 20k some guy got chaffed that i wouldnt sell it fer 5k
---
Yeah, I got Unyielding to let me share much higher ranks, I didn't do extensive testing but I saw perks falling off a lot. Once I dumped herd mentality it seemed to work fine.
---
alright, send me a message when ready
---
That was the trick, thank you!
---
Amen
---
More likely someone new spawned into the encounter and triggered all the mobs to reset?
---
I hope we can TP people's bases...
---
I agree. But why try selling for alot of caps if I'm trying to get rid of them. Selling them at 50% allows me to get rid of them and allows players to find them easier. And when you see the in game price is higher people will usually buy it.
---
You're welcome!
---
The actual difficulty is a separate issue that I have no opinion on. I simply take issue with the idea of not having difficult rewards for the sake of inclusiveness.
---
added you, send a message when ready
---
Then shut up and play.  Don't like it, leave.
---
alright, i’m on rn so msg when ready
---
It's pretty nice to have for any char really, I finally bought a set of Unyielding +1 charisma for my main so he vendor for 'full price
---
Man I wish I had that floor!!! I love it!!
---
added
---
Sounds amazing lol I cant wait.
---
I’ve a question for you all, since you seem super knowledgeable. I have a BoS officer plan in my vending machine for 250 caps. Is that a fair price? Once upon a time they were rare, but maybe not so much anymore?
---
"he called the shit poop!!!!!"
---
(one of my favorite parts from billy madison movie)
---
I don’t think your tone is appropriate. It’s just a simple request that does not impact your experience of the game in any way.
---
The reason I’m asking for this is because I’ve got a job that requires me to work in shifts. It’s not feasible for me to find a team.
---
Yeah. Even just 2 steel would be nice
---
Wait a minute.
---
Serendipity is 45% DR if you're not wearing power armor and at low health.
---
Emergency Protocols is 50% DR if you're wearing power armor and at low health.
---
Where's the perceived imbalance here?
---
If you stack either of those with Blocker, Dodgy, Nerd Rage, Lone Wanderer, Action Boy....
---
I mean, the card doesn't say it, fine. But what the hell do you want? Immortality? Where'd the challenge be then? Why would you play?
---
Look at it like this.... Protocols is 50%. If Serendipity stacked it'd be 95% (if additive) and 78.5% (if multiplicative, which it is).
---
Why would it be OK to you to introduce that level of broken-ness into the game? I mean, think about it. Couple that lot with blocker, dodgy, high agility (high AP), LW, NR....you'd be pressing 99% DR. What'd be the point in playing??
---
I don't get your point of dissatisfaction.....can you please clarify?
---
I would be up for it.
---
Instigating fatman
---
I believe it is 5 hp over 2 seconds per each enemy hit. 
---
It has been a little bit since I tested and I was over 50% irradiated at the time so it might actually be 5% per hit like I've heard medics is, but I didn't test it at full health to see.
---
if you mod with calibrated shocks, then you dont have to worry about the bug :)
---
it is alos possible it is not the bug, but that you have weight reduction armor equipped (which is auto-unequipped when you enter PA)
---
Because of that "feature" I actually gain about 100# when I get in my excavator.
---
Hahaha maybe to the people in that circle jerk. Sell that for a few thousand and know its going to a good home.
---
Every Bethesda game was buggy as hell at launch
---
The technology just isnt there yet...
---
When I get home I’ll try 1 point, thanks.
---
Wait, how is junkies resource intensive? I posted my junkies build the other day and got 1 comment, I'd like to know these things lol
---
I agree with this. The assholes really stand out,  but the community is mostly kind people just trying to enjoy themselves.
---
Be quiet penis
---
It would impact me if my team and I had our time grinding expert and standard wasted by Bethesda giving away the rewards in novice after a while. Also, that’s irrelevant. They shouldn’t cater to that because of your job. Play when you have the time. What about people can’t afford the game? Should they get a free copy? That’s a can of worms game companies shouldn’t worry about.
---
You can definitely get rid of them quickly if you sold them on the cheaper end of their value. It seems like with the prices you currently have, you're easily losing like 90%+ of the value of rarer plans.
---
Which ones are OP to you? In the title.
---
Cavalier's - are you always sprinting? Hell no. And if you have dodgy, you're not doing it for long. Can't rely on this bunny for defense.
---
Sentinel's - are you always stone-still? Maybe you are. Maybe you're a sneaky VATS thing. Would you be wearing power armor? Eh, no. So how does this compare?
---
What circlejerk?
---
Amd yeah you can do that, but I'm just saying that there's literally no point in screwing yourself over on tens of thousands of caps.
---
lol yeah, it was like a market street around the overseers camp too.  i love going just across the street to price check competition against each other haha
---
Can you please offer an example?
---
Seriously?? It has to be more then 15
---
novice doesn't have a time limit...
---
Sorry, due to tool limitations, they can't restore individual items including scrip.
---
And what do these "bounty hunters" do? There's no PvP besides workshops, and no griefer worth anything would claim a workshop and keep it.
---
It wouldn't bother me, people sell whatever they want.   
---
I'm going to contest your "barely made the stretch goals" though, we were like millions over lol
---
You're all fantastic - thank you for the advice! Good to know about the quest design. Did get someone to help / up to lvl 22 but will step back from the quests for a bit!
---
I sell way more shotgun shells and 308 than I do 556.
---
The only ammo you cant get 1:1 for is .38 and Fuel.  Everything else sells.
---
If it doesnt, go to a server with a lot of low end players on it.  They will buy the shit out of your ammo.
---
I'm just complaining, I know they're not gonna do shit about it.
---
Most of the assholes on their list are pvpers. I think the guy that stole my shit was a known fight-starter. The BH I talked with said something along those lines. 
---
In short you’ll have to ask them. Most actual assholes I’ve met in this game have all been pvp provokers, making me believe they want to be able to back up their actions in combat too.
---
I just have like 9 perks to increase semi auto damage.
---
I dont sell .45 because I use it. 
---
Most ammo will sell at 1:1
---
Its how I make most of my random caps, ammo sales.  Not on reddit either, just from my vending machine.
---
Do the rifleman and gunslinger perks still stack if you put a rifle stock on a pipe revolver? Didn't know if maybe they fixed that.
---
Tragic ending to a thrilling story
---
U sure about that i only attempted it once so idk my freind went back a room and got force ejected from the vault and he refuses to do it again
---
Sure but then players should be able to sell what they can make with those plans
---
An extra hundred thousand. We ended at 600,000
---
I get where you are coming from. 
---
Here is my problem. My job requires me to work shifts (day, evening or night). My IRL friends don’t play fallout. 
---
So for me (and probably many other people with jobs) it’s not feasible to find a regular team. I don’t really want to play with random people every time.  On top of that, I prefer to play alone. I talk all day. I play fallout to unwind. 
---
On top of that (I see this a lot, not just in your post), I don’t think it’s wise to find a sense of accomplishment in a videogame. It shouldn’t be normal to grind for hours in a game. Don’t play videogames all day. Find a sense of accomplishment in the real world.
---
Serendipity doesn't proc every time and again compare that to someone using assassin sentinel or other legendary armor using those same perks and you'll see that PA still wouldn't be as strong as normal legendary armor already is.
---
This makes me wonder what else I can launch other than cows and people. My collectron maybe, or the scorched that spawn in my camp. Hmm.
---
alright, message me when ready
---
Still stacks
---
I want to recap
---
- You died at SQB
---
- He stole your loot bag
---
- To counter this, you visited his camp and gave the arsehole your caps
---
- He acted the dick over this
---
- You countered this unpleasantness by dropping him ammo and stims
---
- Now he's on a hit list of some kind, which....eh, survival is gone and it's very hard to initiate PvP in adventure, so....?
---
I get your gist here - kill him with kindness, right?
---
But that's not what you did. You fed it. He's gonna be an even bigger dick now.
---
....or am I just nuts that I can't see the point of this?
---
Yay, and the pulse rifle and pistol and the g11e and the .223 pistol and the turbo plasma rifle and make the alien blaster great again and...
---
Nice this almost identical to some people I see in Whitespring. They have these bear rug spiral CAMPS.
---
Your argument boils down to all builds that are OP are fine except being a tank build is not ok for some reason
---
Most a holes will shoot first... then anyone is free to kill them.
---
I already did
---
I've tried hunting scorched a little..... the problem is they don't respawn fast enough. I can clear out a town/whatever and then I'm just twiddling my thumbs waiting on a respawn. 
---
Having a zealots weapon wouldn't really change anything.
---
There's a "pay to win" fridge and scrap collector for you to get pissed about too
---
naming my plasma gatling wint like a badass
---
Doesn't 2 shot hurt accuracy though?
---
Can't really count damage from shots that don't connect.
---
Most perks that dont work with PA would be fairly balanced if they did half the effect.
---
Idk I was taking it less seriously than he was. He said reported me and he was clearly annoyed while I was just finding something fun to roleplay into.
---
Why is this so downvoted.
---
No problem. I founded a group called The Law on the Xbox to deal with shitheads like that. We've been retired for ages now, but maybe it's time to get back into it, especially hearing how much it means to the people that need the help.
---
Thats a bummer, im a heavy build
---
Sometimes I take a shot at somebody, just playing around, not just if they're in a vendor or scrip machine. Usually I just take my impatient ass to another station
---
Monty python anyone?
---
“*vault* steel”
---
Yep.
---
Start out a session with the goal of X, then a nuke goes of .... Squirrel! ...
---
and there goes that session plan.
---
Next session, end up with a group running some event ... Squirrel! ...
---
and suddenly, its a week later, and you still haven't gotten back to X.
---
Yao Guai heads only give a 25% damage bonus, so that's why they survive.
---
Number is based on my own testing.
---
Ahh, I see. I attended Biv’s school of hedonism where I learned that tomorrow is a myth and that the time to live is now. 
---
Might be why I’m always broke.
---
I actually like Zealot weapons and putting prime receivers on them to using during Scorched Earth. So I'd be happy if I ended up finding any zealot explosive rifles or shotguns at your camp.
---
When you talk about percentage chances, you look at gain over time. Sure, it might not proc 5 times in a row (such is the coin toss) but then again it might also proc 5 times in a row (yay, I'm INVINCIBLE!).
---
Let's look for a minute at why someone would wear PA:
---
- Rad res - broken on non-PA, unfortunately, but there you go. It's a thing. You can wear this or a hazmat, and you won't get legendary armor bonuses either way.
---
- Damage res - also broken. PA just has an inbuilt "-x%" that we still don't get, but it's there.
---
- Carry weight for low strength builds - str goes to 11, yay! Put it with a Radicool and mutations, yay, 17!
---
- Fall damage - eh? What's that?
---
- Drowning - nope, can't.
---
Now let's look at Sentinel and Cavalier.
---
- Cavalier - Are you always ALWAYS sprinting? No? Then when you stop, you're fucked.
---
- Sentinel - Are you always ALWAYS still? No? Then when you move you're fucked.
---
And lastly, let's talk Assassin....
---
PvP.
---
Enough said.
---
If you want to be top dog in PvP in PA, then serendipity is not your answer, it's Strangler PA.
---
Serendipity wouldn't save you from it, and you would be back here complaining if it did.
---
Listen, I'm very sorry you lost your ~~bully-mode~~ survival mode, but your suggestion is beyond nuts. Others are pointing this out to you also, I'm just the one with the highest wordcount, I think.
---
that sounds more like a bug or maybe a game crash than anything, cant say i ever heard of that happening.
---
novi does not have a timer,you could stay in there until the server goes down. the only part that does in novice, is each step of the reactor, which won't fail mission and wont kick you out but just makes you restart the reactor startup stage.
---
standard is the first with a timer, and expert timer gives you half of what standard has.
---
Check out the page or the hashtag my buddy and co creator did that cover and it came out amazing!
---
Bloodied builds do the most damage and then I believe comes in junkies builds but I like to play with AAE or TSE Weapons I do almost 700 DMG with my TSE Gauss
---
I encountered a funny bug in grafton earlyer. After being hit by a explosion from a car i engolfed in flames but was not taking any damage what so ever from the fire. The fire lasted till i rebooted.
---
&gt; It’s ultimately just a game
---
Can't argue with this. You're absolutely right. We all lose sight of this sometimes, I think.
---
I just....don't do the killing with kindness thing. I prefer killing with killing :P
---
Agree that your approach will long-term make the community stronger, and I'm all for it.
---
Funny thing is I want to note, not all “assholes” are irredeemable. I met a quite endearing one that was roleplaying as a raider overboss. 
---
He’s the one from my first post about PVP and I learned the appeal of PVP from him. We wave and give thumbs up when we see each other nowadays.
---
Same i just use eather my BE Combat Rifle or my Mutated Meat Hook.
---
I'm just over here wondering why the pop of NW is still dismal after Survival got shut off.
---
magnificent. i love this ingenuity!
---
Sorry, I may have missed it, so can you paste it here? Thanks!
---
Of the people I've ran into in game, 2 followed me around and kept doing slap damage until I blocked them, another insisted on acting like a creepy SoB going on an on about how he could murder me and in what *graphic* ways over his mic, and most others I've gotten close enough to interact with were doing their own thing and either didn't have mics or didn't want to interact. Which is fine, but does make it difficult to make friends.
---
I'm aware it's *possible* to have positive interactions with strangers in FO76 at random. It just hasn't actually happened for me.
---
I didn't know they have changed it I have to bp and havent learned it. I been looking at pics of it online
---
to quote you in another thread: "proof or it didn't happen" :'D trolls be trolling lol
---
Yea i got the bp the other day I havent learned yet cause I want to try to get a few more to sell
---
Yeah highest damage but at the cost of lower your health. Basically a glass cannon. 
---
There are some stealthy builds with super high agility that the glass cannon isn’t a problem.
---
i didnt say its an ideal solution, but short term something that would work. this is the first thing in the game that needs a team afterall.  its potentially a start toward content that will make grouping up more benificial and be a reason to add more and more friends.
---
  hopefully with wastelanders we get something like you are suggesting
---
Some people refuse to turn on passive mode on principle I guess. 🤷‍♀️
---
Yeah I like playing stealth marksman build
---
I've been thinking about putting a Prime Receiver on mine. Doesn't use much ammo so not as bad a grind for the Ultracite 2mm. Can any confirm if TSE Gauss would become even more of a beast Primed?!
---
Junkies gives damage bonuses without the health cost of bloodied... I use a junkie exploding .50HMG most of the time...
---
I personally witnessed how unyielding goes. My STR is currently at 26 with just two pieces. Hoping to get lucky with the 50% discount, assuming the community kills enough scorch.
---
I don’t have it prime but I’m sure it would be a complete monster with the damage
---
We can definitely relay this idea back to the team! Thank you for posting.

---
 &gt; We can definitely relay this idea back to the team! Thank you for posting.
---
It absolutely 100% does not.
---
I have two main toons, level 404 and 11x(something? she levels so fast). My main wears PA, my alt does not. Both are bloodied. Both are tanks. Both are successful and fun. I'm very happy to link both - here you go:
---
My PA build and my main. Very very very hard to kill.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e114ebb&amp;d=sb1sq2s32sr2sg2p00eu0c72ii0s11ip2ir2l71lt2lu2ls2a12a04s72ic4&amp;w=&amp;m=5c29fe8&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
My meathook build, and my almost-main now, as she's faster and more fun to play. Terribly hard to killl, but yes, it happens. Not as tough as the PA build, but hey, she's a one-hit machine, and you should see what she does to the queen with a couple of perk swaps....
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1648bb&amp;d=s92se2ss2sg2s50si0sj0pe0eu0c72i44ir2a12a00au2la2lt2lu2l71am2ej4aj0&amp;w=&amp;n=PvE%20Bloodied%20Hook%20Tank&amp;m=c249fe8gh&amp;nw=
---
Like, where are you going with this?
---
In PvE either of the builds linked above are crazy hard to get killed with. In PvP, I just swap in a chameleon piece on the melee and use tele-vats and again, I can't die. The PA guy is never going PvP, and if II wanted to, I'd wear Strangler.
---
What EXACTLY is your complaint??
---
I’m doing part for sure trying to get that discount just hoping they can up the pool for scrip I go though 150 in like 3 minutes it’s a shame
---
if you feel up to it yet, but its gonna be a hell of a mat burn.  the person who posted the first expert clear stealthboy spammed his way through it.    
---
imo its just much easier and less stressful in a group
---
They were always upset before survival ended when they ran into a critical vats build.
---
Before the damage cap, I was one shotting them with a naked black powder pistol.
---
Just the other day I ran into a legacy explosive energy weapon using, sentinel/assassin's equipped, stealth boy popping player. I managed to sneak up behind him. I saw him crouched and assumed chameleon armor. I opened fire, causing him to panic and saw him sprint away while still invisible. Stealth boy. Completely countered my sneak, headshot, critical hit multiplier build. He eventually spun around and obliterated me with with beam splitter explosions. I told him I would stay and play if he dropped the stealth boys. He gave a thumbs up and stuck to his word. I respawned to him standing and jump spamming, the telltale sign of sentinel set users, and killed him before he could get a shot off. He came back and I killed him again. He came back again with stealth boys and I left.
---
I tried to have a conversation with him, but the game always mutes me when I kill another player. I can hear them, they can't hear me. IDK what is up with that. I assume I've been reported so much for workshop PVP that the game automutes me assuming I'm an actual griefer.
---
Maybe you just need to play more. I have a big list of friends now. All of which I've met in game at some point. So there are at least 3-4 people online in my friends list at all times whenever I get on
---
I'm a surviving member of the brotherhood of steel. Found one of you 76'ers dead and decided to take that handy lil pip boy off his hands.
---
Sounds like I might be a god with this thing. I'll have to test it today.
---
is he? You come across as incredibly whiny in MOST of your posts =\_= I can see why he would think its you taking things personal. It'd do you a world of good to look at the positives occasionally rather than obsessing about the negatives :/
---
That was funny af. Thank you
---
I think it's a decent idea, I'm just worried that we'd be spread out too much across servers to actually see any action. 
---
Plus we'd still be surrounded by pacifist players which ruins the whole tension-danger-around-every-corner vibe that made survival mode so fun.
---
how long do you find the waits are for a  full lobby? and what system are you on?
---
Either that or the devs could do some fucking development.
---
I laugh out loud, lol!
---
I gave up on vault raids because they’re next to impossible to complete solo, and I don’t always have friends playing when I do. a match/team making system is really needed for vault 94 and any other raids they do. I almost finished on novice mode solo but was killed, and then spawned outside with all my guns and armor broken and out of ammo. I don’t know then logistics of implementing a team making system here, maybe it’s not possible, but for me I can’t enjoy the vault raids without some way to make a full team.
---
Despite the douchebaggery desplay that guy put on I think you've maintained a very good and positive attitude about it all. Hopefully this guy was just pissed at other things in general and that's not normally how he acts or he's got some lonely times a head of him. What platform are you on? I like your attitude and wouldn't mind adding you for if something comes up in the future for group  quests or whatever

Thanks for the support and I hope to see you ingame, if you’re on PS4 let’s hope they implement crossplay 😆
---
Not to be a dick, but I've bought drills from harbor freight that outperformed bethesda's
---
Been messing with different Primed Laser Rifles, AAE, TSE, Vampire, Furious etc, using different mods, FFR with or without Auto vs Beam Splitter etc. Pretty fun stuff. Auto Vamp just removes the need for Stimpacks completely haha, great for high health builds. More experimentation needed though. The explosive effect is very confusing on different enemies, especially SBQ.
---
A bump to 250 per day would be perfect.
---
This is the answer to OP’s problem 100%. The vault raids are not designed for “a casual solo player” and they should not be made easier to accommodate that player base or else they will no longer serve their purpose as end game content for high level teams. We desperately need a way to form those teams and take on multiplayer content, we absolutely do not need to be drawing plans from novice runs; there are only 16 plans you’ll get them all pretty fast either way.
---
Hmm. Not sure. My one and only trip so far lol.  I needed Formula P ingredients
---
nope, RNG shined on me last night.  
---
Picked up a vampires explosive combat rifle.  This completes my full health rifles build.

Platform?

As a sacred time of year, I will be roaming Appalacia eating pumpkin soup and pumpkin pie. Each day one sacred day closer to the devil's thinning......and sweets.....lots and lots of sweets
---
I think the difference with the sub-reddit is you know what you want, know what you're getting and have direct access to it vs. in-game where you have to stumble upon it randomly. The prices are higher because of this... capitalism at work.

While I appreciate your advice, sir, I should also mention that I work for 16 hours a day 4/5 times a week and I am still able to hop on for 2 hours to raid with my buddies  (whom I just met in the game through trading, they   
---
 also have jobs by the way). The entire point of my post was - if you put your time and effort into something, you should expect a better result, if you are playing casually, then don't expect best items in the game. The game has basic tools to team up: 'Invite to team' option and a voice chat, and as I've said, "Standart" difficulty doesn't require any skill or grinding whatsoever, just a party of 2 people who at least have a weapon to shoot or swing. After all, this game was supposed to be played together, otherwise you can't expect all the benefits from an online play :)
---
they were teaching kids how to create a random number generator in schools in the 80s.
---
Back then it was BASIC, but I was still taught in 1989.
---
They mentioned it in a recent 'inside the vault' as one of the things they've heard the community wanted that they're actually working on. They didn't say when we would get it but it implied that it was coming in the near future.
---
In their current state of course, but imagine all the raw power of a 3 star drill. The drill at full speed, your hand shaking with anticipation. Then...Bam!!!!! All 15 damage sinks in the flesh of your enemy. Scorched shudder to think of such a weapon, griefers would finally have something to fear. Much justice could be brought to Appalachia with a weapon such as this one.
---
Well my community does something similar...
---
I'd just carry a Vamp for a quick switch and heal ;) . TSE is pretty crazy with the Beam Splitter. AAE seems to be the best for damage overall. Though, they all just break so quickly.
---
I legit one time saw a dude selling a PPP for 25k caps.
---
I mean, I sell them too as a joke, but a price that doesn't surpass the 150 caps.
---
Too depressed to play lol. And I kind of like NW, but it's not the same at all. Even when I play NW I'm basically playing solo just hoping I get the chance to murder someone. I dont care about winning or teamwork at all.
---
I find it dickish that useless weapons exist. It's obvious they did it to dilute the loot pool with fail rolls because what other reason is there to allow them to be crap? They don't even reach level cap other than the Shovel, which has so low damage that I'm sure shovel knight is offended.
---
just check spawns you'll get it free
---
See, I’m 100% with you there, but I’d argue it’s more based on context in my situation. 
---
I died as soon as the event ended and I had no junk before it ended. On top of that, he saw that it was clearly me who dropped the bag upon death, killcam is handy sometimes. 
---
When arguing theft, it’s important to factor in context like the courtesy to not take advantage of unfortunate timing. I had earned that scrap via the event and had dropped via unfair death.
---
This unfortunate game mechanic doesn’t excuse this behavior because he was knowingly taking something I had earned and had little control over losing. This in my opinion is a form of theft.
---
Just the kind of camp I love finding, fits seamlessly into the wasteland, very believable, thanks for sharing the clip.
---
Well done!
---
I have a AAE and TSE but the TSE shreds but the accuracy is bad while on the other half the AAE is better from far
---
Mr fuzzy Paddle Pall.. sure its damage might be off the radar but if you kill a player with this, they usually rage quit the game.  And to me that is truly powerful.
---
I approve of your new food delivery service venture and wish you well.
---
There is a new nuclear winter map so if you don’t mind BRs you might enjoy it
---
if you are referring to a non specific build (not bloodied (low health) or junkie's (chem addict)), the prefixes you might want to look for are anti-armor, instigating or executioner's. handmades are probably the best rifle but fixers can be argued. Gauss rifles and railway rifles hit pretty hard but recoil is the tradeoff. those might be some.
---
Hey I’ve lost many of stable flux due to death. I don’t go and try and get my stuff back if I die. It’s my fault I died and those are my consequences. He was a pretty big jackass to you though. That was uncalled for.
---
Given how difficult it is to find a couple players that are reasonably familiar with the raid and capable of working together as a unit, I’m actually in support of this.
---
There is no system in place for group finding in-game, aside from panhandling at camps and train stations.
---
Even if the chances were very low in novice mode, say 1%, that would afford a reason to burn a bunch of ammo and other resources on a daily run.
---
I’m only level 41 but when I reach level 50 I’ll be looking for people that volunteer like this.
---
It just works
---
With my bloodied perk setup, fury and sneak x2.0 bonus I one swipe kill those pesky sheep with a bloodied DCG, if I miss then a few more swipes once I lost my x2.0 sneak bonus.

The sheepsquatch hunt questline, vault raids, community challenges (project clean appalachia), NW challenges, uncovering vault 51 secrets on NW by levelling up, etc... And that's for name a few.
---
I agree that I'm losing alot of caps but befesda needs to make caps more accessible and remove the caps limit cause some stuff people charge on forms cost 30k or more witch means you need to have multiple characters. Wich is total bs.
---
I love my hunting rifle , kills shit just fine , I aim for the face of a mutant or any humanoids. The thruster on a mr. Handy , that kind of stuff . Boom dead.
---
Luck of the draw would proc for me even with my weapons being over 100% repair. This was a few months ago though as I made a new character and I no longer run luck of the draw. Assuming they didn't change it, it should still proc even with your weapon being over 100% repair. It would just repair up to 150%
---
i can carry you through if you want
---
We seem to play the game differently then, and that’s ok. The point I’m trying to make is the deaths in public events are not meant to drop scrap. 
---
By taking my dropped loot, this was taking advantage of a questionable game mechanic. 
---
If it were any other situation I wouldn’t be claiming this as theft.
---
apparently you are missing something.. rubber is a component in several junk items..
---
It’s in weapons, armor, surgical trays, basketballs and other objects
---
Infact if something else blows me a kiss during this I die, it's all in the approach and timing I find. Shadowed, muffled leather armor, 4x unyielding, 1x chameleon.
---
5000 caps for a great weapon is a damn steal.
---
I bought an AA/FFR/AG 50cal for around 20k caps a few weeks ago and felt like I got a great deal. ( yes I normally run bloody, but I got it for the vault raids where radiation is an issue going solo)
---
Prime out the Action Hero. You won't be sorry. ;)
---
Kinda like the paladins the best
---
But no *Casper the ghost* outfit, me sad :((
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
There's so much toilet paper we should be able to.
---
I’m getting the same issue
---
You can scrap items you find. Basketballs are rubber, as an example. Also, you can actively search for materials in items, you can activate this option in the Pipboy. If you look at an item, it will have a magnifying lense next to its name if it provides the materials you search for.
---
Also, did you never pick up items to scrap them? Rubber is not a really rare find. Fire extinguishers are relatively common in the starting areas (Airport has lots), so I cant really imagine that you never found an item that contained rubber.
---
And about the last part in your post. Scrapping junk is one of the first things the game teaches you, alongside with crafting new items out of the scrap. So "not figuring it out" isnt really an argument hete.
---
If you ever played Fallout 4, you should already know everything about scrapping junk for mats to create new stuff anyways.
---
Don’t forget the stealth bonus, and amazing VATS efficiency.

It was meant.to be veil, but yes, he is a little thinning with a bad comb over and a vile temper if you mention it lol
---
No one can steal anything from you. If you die the same second the event ends you’re out of luck. Just gotta deal with it. Will be far from the last time it happens.
---
I'm not sure what you mean.. You didn't know about scrapping junk for basic materials? Or you expected the quest to point you to the materials you need? Or something else? I played in the BETA so it was all figuring stuff out in game and it wasn't difficult. Most junk items make  a little sense as to what their junk yield is, like kickballs and basketballs give rubber when scrapped.
---
Heres a great resource for future junk issues you may have, the first page on item respawn in the document is especially important:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where\_to\_farm\_all\_the\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/)
---
I figured it out. Refined also has hipfire accuracy as well. Hardened 50 isn't in the game
---
Do you have a link to where they mention the "mischief filled event"?
---
putting the stability and "fun" aside (because we can all agree that stability as a whole needs to be better and fun is dependant on the person.)  and i know the whole reason this thread was started was because of the nerf raid thread going on.

this sub amazes me.

I hope we get an outfit that is just a white sheet with holes in it. Budget ghost outfit. =D
---
um no.  You get scrip from the daily.
---
I will forever do this every day for the extra scrip.  It takes like 3 minutes to run the body to the graveyard. 
---
And getting a shovel should be pretty easy.  I keep one on me at all times.  Ok, so I keep my shovel on me at all times because its a 90% reduced weight, FSS, +100%dmg while sneaking.  So its kind of a badass shovel.
---
Thank you sir!
---
We vibrate, we live, we are reborn. To traverse the mission is to become one with it.
---
Why?  No idea, but currently that is the way it's set up (so you're not imagining things or making some error in comparison).
---
It's one thing on a list of 28348 that never got addressed when porting 76 over from Fallout 4 (no idea if the error existed in 4 or if it was something that got screwed up in translation).
---
Yeah, why not? I'm interested. Hell, they might already bringing back the classic plasma rifles, there was concept art for it after the last E3.
---
When you put it that way I see your point. Thanks for the advice. I need to stop expecting everyone to see my circumstances the same way I do.
---
Got it... :(
---
That’s a lot of caps. I’m almost at 200 and I’ve got 5 serum plans. I also have almost all of the building and weapon plans. But those serum recipes are a real grind. Not that many people have all of them.
---
So nice to have someone like you in the community. I wish you were on PS4. I only have a 2 person team and we can only do novice mode so we never get plans. Nonetheless I want to say thank you and I hope you have an amazing weekend friend.
---
Yeah the TSE just goes everywhere haha. Do you feel it breaks quicker? Have you messed about with AAE making them Auto, with or without Beam Splitter?
---
I'm torn between keeping FFR Semi, or Auto, if I can up the damage enough to counter the faster rate vs the bloody thing breaking... I Primed mine to get a little more kick out of them too.
---
Sounds like a laggy server or something wrong with your local provider. 
---
I was lagging super hard during a queen fight the other day, finished, got up for a can of soda and see my wife is downloading a heap of music from some pirating site. That explains things.
---
( no, there were no folks in strangler armor or anything outside the ordinary)
---
It’s all good. No one likes losing their stuff, but there needs to be some penalty for death.
---
:D
---
Bloodied Explosive Faster Fire rate Gatling Plasma.
---
This is the most powerful weapon in the game.
---
This looks ok but imo it’s far from what the post is looking for. Seems like a high end melee bloodied build.

There’s no accompanying weapons, no anything other than go out and punch stuff and not die from low health.

I wish I had taken pictures, but I ran into a really sweet camp on xbox. HilaryzHitman was the gamer tag but he made use of a small tunnel under a road (like you commonly see a lot of people do) in the Mire region but it wasn't just a camp under the road- he/she/they connected a building on each side of the road. Part of it was locked and I didn't wish to anger anyone to fully see the entire camp but it was beautifully laid out. I think I just bought a 1000 caps worth of plans I didn't really want cause I was so impressed. I think it has been one of the better ones I have came across in a very long time.
---
Test your critical hit damage. I am discovering that some weapons have higher or lower critical multiplier than others. Receiver type can provide a bonus multiplier. We have damage indicators now, so find a ghoul, crit it in the chest with the refined, write the number down, do the same with the standard .50, and let us know the results. You can also do one normal body shot, one critical if you want to see exactly how much the critical portion is adding.
---
They didn’t go away, I guess.

A pusher and spoon, great for the starter, main course and desert.

It's because the wanna make a statement by denouncing it but they realize that fans of the game cancels out their derision so they attack the players who enjoy it

RUN AWAY!

I lost a set of armour to that little bug too...
---
Melee two-handed weapons are still pretty OP.  I don't have any true melee builds but when my high strength characters pull out a Super Sledge or Grognak's Axe they do some serious damage.  Add melee perks and Bloodied or Furious and you'd pack a hell of a punch.
---
It's at the bottom of the first post.
---
Refined- better crit damage
---
True- better hip fire (tighter reticle when not aiming)
---
Stabilized- better recoil for ads
---
Aligned- reduced AP cost
---
Speedy- faster reload
---
Perferating- armor pen
---
There can be some combined but it's good start for attachment knowledge.
---
Some things like piercing have little armor pen with little faster reload.
---
There's a nice sheet some where im the google land that breaks down all actual numbers.
---
+special effects aren't great. Explosive is great, but Stalker's is poop. Two shot is good, but limb damage is just mediocre. I would go with Two Shot unless you spec into 5 intelligence for Demo Expert

I'm don't use discord, are you able to provide any more details here? ;)

I run 2 lmg's too. I have a prime instigating explosive and an AA without prime. I use the prime for the big nastys and the AA for trash. Splits the ammo type to so I won't run dry.
---
Of course. We have a community of about 130 ppl. There r always nuke callouts to join. We have a trading hub. Do u have any specific questions?

Same. I sold The Fixer plans for 2800 caps a few nights ago in my shop. I'm sure whoever saw it shit themselves, but they cost me nothing to get, plus it was my second one in a week.

Morgantown for Glowing Ones! Harper's Ferry for Flux! ;)

Supposedly they changed it so you're not limited to a regional server so if your area has low participation it will place you on a more active server even if it's farther away.

Because original thought is bad.  Do you not watch the news.

Welcome to the elite cadre of two dozen players that bother with the vault!

No but it crashed to desktop once when my character was placed in the game right when loading was done.

No, don't worry. There's no such thing as to much help. I'm getting ready to fast travel to Abby's Bunker. So we should know soon. Hopefully I leave with a pet.
---
Just ignore them. They get off on hating things.
---
no, i think its because the youth of the world are trying to push communism and/or socialism on the rest of us who dont agree with their ideologies or interests.
---
They are sad noone will play minecraft with them, so they come and try to disrupt our community to get more people to hate on Fo76 because we are happy and they cant stand it.
---
Cowtapult was easy, but tremoochet? Truly stellar work, consider this pun stolen.
---
I think the two shot with limb damage is better.  Explosive bonuses are only mediocre and require a 5* card to boost.  Limb damage plus One Gun Army (which I think gives a chance to cripple for both shots of the Two Shot) will leave your opponents crawling on the ground at your mercy.
---
Brahmin Ballistae, then.

Hey man, I've got a spare t51b set you can have / trade, a mix of l50 and l30 parts with some mods. I'm online now for another 10 mins or so, DM me

Is there a way to say what people can do to avoid the wipe glitch without giving away how to do it to others?

I use both. I use armored when I'm fighting, and capacity when it's time to FT somewhere. They're pretty light, so there's not reason to just have one.
---
Cool, thank you. I’ll probably use that one. I’ll probably display the other until I’d wanna sell
---
Cool I'm at work but during my breaks I smoke and get on reddit so keep me updated

thank you for taking the time to write such a friendly and considerate reply!  it is heartening that we can have such open dialogue over the internet!
---
-terminals: haha i still don't know what happened in 94 so ill have to keep an eye out for the next oxhorn video i guess!  but it is a conceit of 76 that they can kinda shortchange the lore if they give us enough atmosphere &amp; that players dont have to know what the stakes are to get in and play.
---
-1 v 4: i was just wondering who are the players that beth wants to court (the proverbial whales).  which set of players stick around for long periods  and spend money on games like this?  i honestly don't know and am very curious as to how the numbers shake out.  certainly, there are dedicated clusters of players and dedicated individuals; can beth successfully cater events/raids/locations to mollify both parties? (also bearing in mind that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive to each other)
---
  nevertheless, i think we can all agree that a LFG tool will render 85% of this debate moot.  
---
-"boring":  i will readily concede that this is an issue of diff strokes for diff folks, and just wanted to offer my opinion (as also a solo filthy PS4 casual).  imo, not sure that fallout can compete with other games out there like BL3, destiny2, or even Rage 2 for that kind of experience.  (ie the quests/motivations are stupid but who cares we are having fun shooting guns and blowing stuff up! (which i also enjoy, pleasedontmisunderstandme))
---
-builds/roles:  good to know &amp; thanks for the headsup!  i saw some ppl mention exterminator perk max rank was the only real requirement than any other special
---
-plans: this is where the cognitive dissonance begins to kick in.  why would they not let ppl trade/barter?  my speculative guess is that it has to do with the architecture of events/awards rather than some nefarious atomshop plot.  however, i would like to note that ppl can engage in this lofty goal of "community" w/o having to complete the actual event by trading.  as mentioned earlier, this is not my cup of tea, but i see how others can really enjoy themselves in this gametype.  i personally enjoyed many of the camera challenges, but i could see how that is boring AF for diff players (can't wait to build a full set of Daguerreotype power armor!)
---
Sever stability has everything to do with it. The raids are finicky, lots of pickups, picklocks, hacking. Even a little bit of lag can seriously derail your run.
---
Since this is instanced, I see no problem with having different settings between solo raids and group ones. Bethesda might, seeing how badly they screwed this up. 
---
For example :
---
Going solo? No time limit. Same rewards as group raids but more hoards.
---
In a Group? No change to how the raid is currently.
---
With Vault 94 buggy and lagged, I haven't been seeing anyone in there recently and nobody should be forced to have to join a group. They did this with the backpack already. Annoying as fuck. 
---
I'm not interested in raiding the vault solo if I get nothing out of it. It's just not fun. It's tedious bullshit. For what? Plans for armor that I'm not going to use? Using an item only found in the vault that I don't want to do?
---
Haven’t tried the collectron yet, I’d be surprised if you couldn’t throw it haha :)
---
Haha throwback
---
Lol sorry man idk how it works over there
---
Will do.
---
&gt;edit : also what would be the point to run anything over novice? 
---
Well since you can only get rewards for each difficulty once per day, you would have to run the higher level difficulties if you wanted to grind.  Plus if I recall correctly they give better rewards, including more Vault steel, so there's still incentive to try the harder difficulties.
---
Thanx just got the armor one,next is high one💪🏿
---
Agree! I thought a “deed” in your vending machine that sold the Camp might work :)
---
I've got 100% fall resistance armor, and love Seneca Rocks. I also spawn in under my floor so I never fall from that. But I love running off my roof and landing WWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY over there lol

Now this is some cool shit
---
Did you have to PvP with the cows lol
---
This alongside massive overheating, though I've never had a warning yet, has plagued my old Xbox One X for ages.
---
I recently got the Gears 5 Xbox One X, and I could swear 76 still makes it pump out a stupid amount of heat, yet other games are fine, so its pretty worrying at times.
---
Yeah, make 20 pieces the amount required for a level 2 friendly.
---
Run up and bash them with your gun. Sometimes that triggers it. I was confused the other day why I could not kill this guy who refused to leave the workshop I was clearly about to claim. Same thing happened today, I bashed the person, and they were flagged, then dead and out of my way.
---
Howd you get that
---
I plan on giving it a try tonight.  I need some people to be there for me while I’m on Rad-X.  That’s a tough time for me.
---
Must be the same because we get disconnect all the time.
---
Funny thing is that so little people play or finish the raids to get those armor pieces that it probably does not make sense investing time and resourced to fix them.
---

I tried :)

You find a spot where the ground is thin, and place a crafting station so that when you exit the station you "pop" on the other side of the world map. You have to do it so that a floor piece is under you, so you don't fall, though.
---
Freaking fantastic.
---
I see some decent, but non god tier ranged weapons for sale on EBay for 20-40 bucks.  I wonder what I could fetch for my AAE Gatling Plasma or AAE handmade or BE auto prime handmade?
---
Shoot me a message!
---
Cool with any of those! Shoot me a message if you wanna join
---
I'm a Rifle/Shotgun build. Can help cripple and round up mobs for low levels wanting to take part in big events. I also craft, mod and service all Power Armor, very handy ;)
---
Sheepsquatches are a blast to fight but have very little reward going for them for the cost of fighting them. I definitely feel like they need to be guaranteed to drop some better loot.
---
PC?
---
Not sure I'd be proud of testing H1Z1.
---
reread my statement.  I said Bloodied Explosive.
---
That’s how many hours I log into base building 🤣 jk...maybe

Since the crash references d3d11.dll that would suggest something with the GPU, as you've gathered.
---
Do you know what temps the card is reporting when the problem occurs?
---
Gloriously
---
This.
---
I would rather fight a level 100 mirelurk queen in a broom closet than have to find a bunch of keycards within a strict time limit.
---
real fallout players dont bash the game.
---
I acquired mine mostly through in player trades.   Got lucky with some at player vending sites.  The best ones were in player trades.  AAE Gatling Plasma and BE auto handmade specifically. 
---
Actually got a few decent ones from the legendary purveyor including one AAE handmade that I eventually sold as I bought another similar one off a player trade.
---
If our times overlap I'd be happy to join, i've never run them before. I'm generally on between 7:00pm - 11:00pm EDT
---
Yeah, but that's logic. Much easier to just accuse the developers of intentionally sabotaging the event.
---
I'm not sure that's an acurrate take. It's just that on the trading sub most people don't want caps. The value still works out the same; this weapon sold for 10k in-game, can use that 10k for an equal weapon purchase. On the trading sub it would be this weapon for that one. If you offer caps, you probably won't even get a reply... I notice the trading subs value certain weapon and armor types more than in-game vendors will though. Like a nice junkie's roll, or certain armor effect combos. And then those players that are aware of that and list accordingly will be seen to have "higher" prices.
---
Is it an old rusted out van looking thing? I'm currently on top of that, and can see a truck with a boat hooked to it.
---
There are modified consoles in which you can mod files. Not as common but it happens.
---
&gt; I am seriously hacked off that my instigating and bloodied DCGs that dropped are both second rate and that I had zero chance of getting top rolls due to Bugthesda.
---
This is the post of someone who's never seen a tiddy.

I can also see the tree the windegos were in.
---
Cool sounds like u would be a good addition to the group. Hope we worth getting discord for. :)
---
Just add me or my friend, we're playing right now and for a couple of hours more.
---
I've never used it so not sure what to do, maybe team up with a group one night. My Xbox GT JaggersLips13
---
Seconded. I have soooooo many legendary songs-to-scrip at this point. Waiting for the 20 hr cycle.
---
If anyone is wondering why so many wanted PvP to end in adventure mode here’s a great example... this is why changes were made. 
---
Bethesda will side with a new low level than a high level fighting noobs... if a lvl 50 is that bored now and not doing other things... yeah... 
---
Bethesda is a business and if players are preventing fun for others those others won’t play and won’t tell friends to buy it... 
---
Down vote me all ya want but that’s the truth like it or not.
---
I would be ashamed of myself if I did QA on H1Z1 too.
---
I screwed up on this I got a bloodied snappy pipe revolver and modded it with long recon scope.  Sold it for 2K caps about a month ago. 
---
Got it dropped from a ghoul at Whitesprings.
---
I have failed it maybe once? And I usually solo or duo it.   Go to room A and try your best to get the radstags to lv up your animal. You only need to save one animal to complete the event. People’s biggest problem is spreading to thin or getting distracted by mobs instead of staying on their animal. I never leave swinging distance of my animal. Until the sheepsquash comes out. Then I usually clear up the wave and go kill the sheep. Doing good dps is important of course. If your not one shotting your animal becomes vulnerable. If I had six people I would focus on only two rooms. 3-4 players per room will guarantee consistent completes. If you want all 3 complete you just need a lot of players, the animals love to sprint off so you always need someone staying by their side.
---
Either give it a low drop chance (maybe 1/4 the chance of the other modes) or put a machine outside the vault where you can buy plans with vault steel (even if it's a ridiculous sum) so that those who can't do the raid on higher difficulties can at least grind the novice raid for steel and buy the plans with the steel after a lot of grinding.
---
Nice. When you dropping the mother lover? I'll be on a little later.
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
Dang that’s terrible performance 😳
---
Do you know if XP gains are better if you play Nuclear Winter?
---
It's unnecessary for Bloodied melee builds. You'll have insanely high STR from Nerd Rage and Radicool, plus the damage boost from the Adrenal Reaction mutation always active. There's no need to increase swing speed if you're going to be killing everything in one swing. The only things that would take more than one hit to kill are SBQ and IS, and you're in imminent danger of getting BTFO'd in one hit yourself trying to use a Bloodied melee build against them.
---
And IIRC, the only V FAST melee weapons in 76 are the Ripper and the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, but the SS legendary effect only makes their power attack swing faster without doing anything to their normal attack rate, essentially making SS on those weapons dud rolls.
---
Just wrong.
---
Yeah true damage drop off from range is pretty steep too. That could explain it.
---
Just finished the Sheepsquatch questline. For the raid, do I need a team?
---
Read
---
It’s so confusing
---
Why...
---
If there was any game better you’d think they would spend their time enjoying it rather than talking about a game they don’t like...  it hey... it’s 2019...lol
---
Lol to show the asylum dresses 😂 I know, I’m crazy lol
---
Shure it is mate we all passed that.
---
This. All the way lol. 
---
I mean, the raids should be the time where Bethesda shines, like, make a room and put an immobile level 150 proto-type sentry-bot or robot tank in the middle, provide the player with some cover. Sentry-Tank can fire multiple guns at anywhere from 1-4 people in a 180 conal area so the team has to work together to draw fire while other members shoot at the bot. When the bot overheats it becomes vulnerable but also the facility’s security turrets come on line. Make them like durable AF turrets and put them BEHIND the previously established cover line. The player can then say, okay who takes out turrets and who DPS’s the bot’s core. After 50% health the sentry/tank prototype gets a rocket turret that pops out and fires a barrage of rockets at one player every like 10-15 seconds. Rinse and repeat until the players die or the bot dies. Boom. Make 3 more boss battles like this and have two per week, no time limit. One acts as a mini-boss/first fight then the second will get buffed and be the boss/end fight. 
---
Again, time limits are just lazy game design. I just shat out a boss battle concept in like 2 mins off the top of my head which uses very little new content/code in the way it’s designed.
---
Will try for sure when the opportunity presents itself.
---
Everything else needs a buff, ESPECIALLY junkie’s. Junkie’s is severely underpowered for the amount of debuffs you get.
---
Please don’t start the nerf bandwagon. PLEASE.
---
I did it one time, after thousands of rounds and many stimpaks I finally died, at which time I learned that it respawns you outside the raid, all junk/progress lost.  
---
I have not bothered a second time
---
I laugh my ass off every time I see this.  I wish it'd happen more often.  I'm on PS4 also.
---
Almost all 30,000+ of my karma is from "positive posts" on this sub. Gtfo of here with that BS. Pointing out legitimate flaws isn't whining, I give credit where credit is due but that isnt that often with this game.
---
Judging by all the downvotes, I'd say you're right. Sorry for wanting to inform of how it actually works. My bad.
---
Yes, I don't know in your country but in my country what sells its just the bad news, who cares if a new born in Africa passes a bad situation, when you can talk about the new born that die the same day.
---
Right?
---
What about 1000 caps for a level 20 handmade 0\* or 500 caps for a vault 76 jumpsuit? Sometimes a shit deal is a shit deal.
---
I see your point but it's also kind of their obligation to fix it.
---
Better come with camp budget increase then.
---
Started with rifle, works amazing. Ran this for about 250 levels and got a bloodied 50 cal drop. Life changing. Rifle was good, heavy is WONDERFUL. I have a basic bloodied 50 cal, don’t need more. Explosive would cost me perks and this thing wrecks face. When I unload on the SBQ her health very visibly drops - it’s satisfying:)
---
I don't understand you sorry, could you explain me pls?
---
Thanks!!
---
The Rusty side of our duo is interested inthe Handmade. How much are yu wanting for it. We have about 8,000 caps and a whole heap of legendaries in our stash.
---
Did you mean bloodied explosive/ffr
---
Why?
---
Gyms usually have basketballs in them and usually about a dozen plus! More than enough!
---
You are more then welcome to spend 5k ammo on the sbq just to fail the event. Bloodied might be super strong but it also takes a lot of effort to put up those big numbers as a GOOD bloodied build. It also sucks dying over and over and over and over. Losing flux to a crazy bear that always seems to target the melee bloodieds after the queen dies 🤣
---
They want it to be hard to earn atoms so you will pay money for them
---
System is working as intended
---
/u/tiptherat you catch this?
---
Ah, you again :) Annoyed you, did I? 
---
I read the thread, can’t find. Link? :)
---
I like those ideas for the other builds!
---
It's commendable, so yeah get some of your friends, go for it boi, yes you can!
---
I got a Last Action Hero for 1500 caps at a player vendor about 3 weeks ago.  Got a Sole Survivor for 2000 caps about 6 weeks ago. 
---
There are deals to be had out there for sure. 
---
Shit I sold a 3 star Bloodied Radium Rifle with FFR for 2000 caps.  Then turned around and bought a Bloodied Railway Rifle with FFR (I added auto piston receiver) for 3000 caps.
---
Yeah PLEASE
---
All you did was make vague claims about PA being better than legendary armor which everyone knows isnt true and then personally attack me like a child.
---
Yep! I seem to run into more way over priced crap rolls than anything. However sometimes you get lucky. For instance, I found a instagating, vats accuracy, faster reload lever action for 1500 caps yesterday.....it's only level 35 , but man that's a fantastic roll and I couldn't pass it up. I bet over on the trading sub I bet I can sell it for a substantial profit.
---
Then take a learning comprehension class.
---
Completely agree with you.
---
Dodgy doesn't work in pa
---
I did the queen and died like 4 times in a row in front of all these power armor players before I could get adjusted. That was embarrassing especially when I’m messaging people to follow directions 🤣. Then I killed the queen. ;)
---
A lot of cap dumps fit niches. PA plans, serums. You need to be a collector. A cap dump for weapons or armor. 
---
If they just put a NPC in like MurMur that replaced a legendary Affix on a weapon, say 5/10 times then the gun broke, people would blow their caps. Problem is they hold little value. So much abundance.
---
I agree. They lost a lot of what they built over the years by releasing this game.
---
I’m actually looking for a good zealot weapon.  So it’d be cool with me
---
You on PS4? Come check out Floopwoods. We got lotsa stuff
---
I do that, it's just that I was tired...
---
I go the Walmart route with my vending prices. Do I 'lose' money selling 2 or 3 star legendaries for hundreds of caps? Sure. But those are hundreds of caps I get before you. I care about how fast I can move my goods, not how much I can get at its premium.
---
They went from a company with a great rep, fun games, and positive community to an EA status fortnite/ rust community.
---
I made CAMP with Bungalow and lost it many times because of "needs support" bug
---
Yep... it started for me when I did Primal Cuts in that region.
---
On PC sorry
---
I honestly don't see the problem with stealth boys. Just like vats, they're available for people to use, and it's a good counter for literal built in aimbot.
---
Meh. These "critics" aren't even gamers. 
---
After all if they were why wouldn't they actually be playing a game as opposed to actively seeking out a community to hate on.
---
I keep toying with the idea of adding a second vendor at my camp, with super good/cheap items in it, that is really hard to get to, and just in plugging my regular vendor. That way people are confused about the offerings (if they are paying attention), and are rewarded for actually checking out my dope camp/being lucky
---
Nothing good? I mainly got armor which was kind of a drag but at least I got 150 back and ran that out at 25% off. Hopefully we get this 50% sale. That’s nuts!
---
As you said, you still need SS on the strongest enemies. It's not that hard to stay alive while fighting enemies like the SBQ, so SS is very much helpful.
---
Weaker and FAST weapons still significantly benefit from SS, because there are several more enemies that those weapons cannot one hit.
---
I said that about V FAST weapons because of what you said, so yeah I agree and that's why they're the only weapons for which SS is not a top desired 2nd star effect.
---
I'm not in pc but I want to wish you look, yes you can!
---
I use it, and the AP goes down at least. I'll have to test this, unless you have a reliable source?
---
I agree, it’s very disheartening when you see a vendor that looks good on the map and it’s all overpriced crap. That’s a good roll, I find on the sub though things that aren’t max level really struggle to sell! But hopefully you manage to!
---
You mean like Tesla rifles, flamers and other high particle weapons, where enemies just become immune and you have to swap to a melee weapon to kill them?
---
Yes, also that. Cant believe I forgot that....Stash increase too!
---
I don't think it would be unreasonable to allow us to buy scrip with caps
---
Shit I got griefed and harassed non stop until about level 60 and then I could fight back and not get my ass totally kicked.  
---
Now at lvl 247 I can (and do) get my ass kicked on occasion but the constant complaining by some of the non PvPers is a bit much.
---
Can you DM me when you launch a nuke, would love to fight a queen! Have yet to do so, I’m on XB1
---
I'd like to see some of the NW wall kits (or other base building mechanics) in there, so you can make defenses around the friendly creatures.
---
again, reread my statment.  all of it.
---
rip
---
From what I have experienced:
---
If you contest an unowned workshop while someone else is in the borders, you can shoot them starting a duel.
---
If you walk into an unowned workshop as it is being taken, you can contest it but cannot shoot them to start a duel. I do not know if they can shoot you to start a duel.
---
Yea I didn’t either. Not until I sold a couple that flew out of my machine at 2.5k. I thought that to be crazy so I started looking into it. The bloodied explosive version is obviously the most sought after but  I just got a level 25 executioners explosive  on my alt so I’m pretty stoked about that.
---
What we really need is for Bethesda to establish *what the stash box limit is meant to be* 
---
This is a survival game first and foremost.
---
Fury + 30 melee damage if ur melee build, I'm thinking of switching to a junkie melee build I'm always popping fury..lol
---
The way I read this, it sounds like you haven't scrapped your junk.  Go to a workbench (Armor, Weapon, Chemistry, etc) and look at the commands.  One will be for scraping.  Press that button/key.  Once in that menu, you can go to your Junk tab and scap all your items individually or look at the bottom of the screen and press the button/key to scrap all your junk.
---
Also when you're on the map screen in game, there is a Help section.  If you're new and need help with the game mechanics, that's a great resource to start with.
---
EDIT: Forgot to mention that in your Junk tab, you can see the base components that each piece of junk has in the description box and the bottom middle.
---
Once I stopped collecting and scripting weapons each day I realized that this game is a gambling simulator (random chance to get decent item) with added cosmetics and a decent amount of bugs.
---
Would not be so sad if there was any content to speak of but once you do the few quests that exist there is really nothing left to do.
---
The single player games could at least be modded with new content and bugs could be fixed by the community.
---
And the fact that their servers can't handle the load is sad as well and I doubt any drastic changes will be done to the source code to fix it.
---
They are probably happy it has not burned down yet and won't press their luck.
---
I played survival a fair amount pre damage cap nerf but rarely played NW.  It just wasn’t my cup of tea.  Plus, all the rumors of cheaters sort of turned me off to the idea.  
---
Not surprised it’s dying I think some people bailed the game after survival got shit canned.
---
Same here the other night at around 145am eastern us til it crashed at 6am. I owned every workshop and was crazy never worried about a single thing was great, was thinking private servers here lol
---
Definitely, but more difficult for sure. Anyone with a pc can easily mod their game files though. 
---
I often hear on pc NW how it's rampant with cheats.
---
It's honestly why I've strayed from PC when it comes to competitive multiplayer
---
I feel its fine right now. 
---
Inventory and stash management is a part of what makes this game so great. 
---
You actually have to think about what you pick up, what to keep, and if it will be useful to you or not. 
---
This is not a collect as much shit as you can game.  This is a make sure you only take what you need to SURVIVE game.
---
Yea I'm roll with it on my alt Character for a while I think, I'm level 36 and can sneak headshot level 68  supermtants, it's pretty ridiculous lol.
---
One of my pet peeves is when people, especially high levels load their vendors with regular non-legendary weapons and armor for a few hundred caps a each so it looks like they have a crap load to good stuff to sell. Like " whoa man, that guy has 17 weapons and 23 prices of armor, let's go check it out!".....So you fast travel there to discover it's a bunch mix matched non legendary level 20-35 weapons priced at 350 caps each and a bunch of very common outfits, or level 10 plain leather armor for 100 caps each..... Thanks for wasting my time dude....
---
I see your finger guns and raise you a auto BE handmade.
---
I’ve gotten atom challenge credit after killing a Scorched dude and a scorchbeast.
---
Later I killed a Scorched wendigo, two Scorched Yao guai and a Scorched megasloth. None counted for the third and final kill.
---
It’s only 20-30 atoms on a single bugged weekly, so the world is not ending, but it’s a little disappointing.
---
Xbox =(
---
Faster fire rate and explosive can not drop on a weapon
---
I’m not sure the rate I only occasionally play NW but it has leveled me up in the past
---
They seem to be pressing their luck pretty hard with repair kits, scrap kits, and now a refrigeration and scrap bot mechanic that can only be obtained through microtransactions. They legit just sold a reskined junk extractor lmao.
---
2 pieces of armor with 50% fall damage reduction.
---
I'd like to second the kudos on "tremoochet"
---
I agree as stated above. 
---
But I feel legendary weapons and armor shouldn’t count as “collecting.”  There should be a bank or separate infinite storage for this
---
I'm 1057 hours lol.
---
im sorry, i thought you were intelligent.   Let me go back and super punctuate my response to make it clearer for your primitive mind.
---
I mean.....if you’re buying gear on eBay instead of trading/finding/earning it, that’s a sign of a larger issue.
---
Can’t say I feel bad.
---
I notice there wasn't the typical disclaimer "no - were hurt in the making of this video."...
---
I'm not sure if you thought my comment was aimed at you. What I mean is this kind of attitude you're describing is very typical of young teens, at least when I was one. Showing they like or dislike the right bands, games, clothes, etc. so the people they look up to will accept them. Hopefully they'll be embarrassed by this in a few years. :)
---
Oh ok, well in case you didn't know faster fire rate and explosive can't spawn on the same gun and what's more explosive can no longer spawn on plasma/laser weapons. And now you are more informed ;)
---
Where do you even check that?
---
Just delivering some ready made meat :)
---
U should try a different game then. I never see people take workshops.
---
I have one.  They are available.  Go to the marketplace.  You just have to spend a shit load of money or trades for one.
---
If you dont want to by the exotics.   Not my problem. But they are still in game.  
---
The OP didnt ask what is the most powerful weapon that still drops, he asked what the most powerful weapon was.
---
The most powerful weapon is the BE Gat Plas
---
The most powerful that still drops is the Bloodied FFR Gat Plas.
---
Hate is a strong word and thrown around too much, people get hate confused with something they dislike. I legit hate one person on this sub and it has nothing to do with 76 at all, it's the type of person they are.
---
I hate "know it alls", just because they assume they are more intelligent so they know what's best and only their opinion matters or is always the right one....reddit is full of these types and if you've ever hit the downvoted button on something you may be who I hate.
---
Fanboys and apologists are a whole nother specimen I'll talk about some other time, they are only good at lining these companies pockets and are fully okay with mediocrity...a cancer to the gaming world.
---
I wonder if that’s Bethesda’s sentiment as well
---
I pvp so I keep most of my Weapons Auto just for the most dmg output
---
SBQ adds target whoever is doing the most DPS to the SBQ during the aggro checks every few seconds ("hive mind" enemy AI, same for Scorchbeast adds, but regular SBs die before anyone notices behavior if you happen to be in a group against one). You'll get mobbed by every Scorched creature and ranged Scorched if you go in swinging wildly with a Bloodied build. Serendipity won't save you from a dozen incoming attacks.
---
No i appreciate it, i wasnt either, just wasnt sure exactly
---
I was in a couple of PvP battles today with some familiar (survival) players after two events were completed.   I got killed several times over because, you know, that can happen when you PvP with other players with decent weapons and decent gear.  
---
I also play solo which doesn’t help as the team can open fire on me but hey that’s part of the gig.  Still had a lot of fun and miss survival.
---
If you decide to go heavy, a Bloodied, FFR, Reload .50cal is your best bet.
---
Simple... would you rather play and talk about a game you like or one you hate? 
---
If people have all this time to discuss how much they don’t like it and are negative, it usually means they have nothing better to do. 
---
To me they should find something they like and enjoy that instead of being negative and hateful... nothing more than that...
---
PvP still exists. I just saw 4-5 players at Bog Town presumably duking it out against each other before I quit the server to go afk. 
---
The trade value seems to be completely stable, so I agree with you.
---
I'm assuming you are on PC. If my assumption is correct which version of Windows are you running?
---
I use the combat helmet and looks really cool, my character is more military style. Not one to wear uncle same outfit running around killing things kinda like the immersion.
---
That's because the large majority of players making this claim are not giving the entire story. They were simply on the losing end and need to make up for it by playing the victim. Just like the guy who shows up at monster mash expecting not to die. Or the guy that gets the bounty because he picked someone's lock to use their workbench. Or the same guy that dies with said bounty screaming bloody murder because you took that bounty.
---
I think you're underestimating how good some people's armor is, chief. Combined with sneaking and being outside of PA, I personally almost never get detected during SBQ fights except by the Queen herself. She still hardly gets to attack me, and I can land several hits with any melee by doing that.
---
Oh sorry I miss understood you, but I'm gonna say one thing... I have 13 years and yes, I've written every single word in here, but yes there are other people with my same age that are just a bunch of... "bad people" right Mr. ?
---
Yeah it’s annoying cause it limits your ability to use the discount to its full advantage
---
They shouldn't have stuff in Vending or Display count toward the stash box limit.
---
I'm thinking that but versus the higher damage with Primed I'm not so sure. What mods do you have on your autos?
---
Lol last time I did the cook out some ding dong went on his mic yelling at players for playing the drums so I ran around jumping all over him and playing the drums...lol what a dic

---
Yes I hit the down vote button some times, I know what you mean.
---
People without judgment right?
---
How so?
---
Yes great idea please do.
---
If people want to (key part there - “want to” ) PvP, more power to them! Enjoy! But a very large amount of people don’t, like at all and Bethesda knows this hence all the changes. 
---
They tried to create a survival mode but made the huge mistake of not making it “survival” at all. 
---
Fact is it’s not survival if you’re not surviving in that mode and have to come back to adventure to fix everything up... that’s not survival 94 surviving...
---
If they made it were you had to start a new character like NW and you had to get everything from that one mode and no back and forth it would have attracted more people, but they didn’t and it started dying.
---
I agree.  It feels ridiculous to say this, but trying to keep my caps down below 30k is becoming a chore.
---
Well said, wish I could understood you earlier.
---
A solo mode would be the best solution indeed. It’s what I should have suggested!
---
Get energy weapon kills. Spawns the stuff
---
Gonna need more information than that.
---
It's pretty easily manageable right now imo.
---
Well since the recoil is bad and I hip fire I try to stay with true barrels and I use the force stock to give it more health and doesn’t break like in 2 minutes it does help a good amount both of them have the beam splitter I have a marksman build but the damage output is higher but in pvp it’s all about DPS so I try to put out more damage as soon as possible that’s why I run auto I’ll check in a few so I can be more specific

---
PA doesn't effect sneak detection and Scorchbeasts and the SBQ can see through invisibility from Chameleon armor or Stealthboys. They're bats, they see with echolocation. You're probably just not drawing aggro because you're trying to be sneaky instead of swinging wildly and getting out-DPS'd by a ranged Bloodied build using a heavy automatic weapon or fanning the hammer on a semi or pistol.

I dont know if that's entirely true. First thing I did at level one was explore the entire map. I never engaged would always sneak around just to discover areas so I could when I started quests I would be able to fast travel. If I could do it anyone could
---
good series can drop everything good then make millions off idiots. People view you guys as the marks that are killing good games. Why make real fallout games when people will pay 35 dollars for a skin in a game that doesn’t even work? Why would they ever make a real game again after this?
---
Why? we did the work, just like any game, the devs however didn't implement bug fixes. If you read my other comments in the post, you'll see that i said there are two problems that lead to buggy games; A bad dev team and a bad FQA team. But there's a difference between the bugs you'll see. The bugs you see if the FQA team sucks will be LQA/ easily fixable bugs, like a bugged loot table. You test it before you implement and then that doesn't happen. The problem with H1Z1 is their runescape level spaghetti code, they couldn't fix a bug without another popping up. They since ended the contract with our studio and ended up having both easily fixable and impossible to fix bugs.
---
How’s shotgun build would you recommend it?
---
Hi and thanks for your recent reports! We've been looking into the issues you've mentioned across [a few](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dcylpy/fallout76_mutation_serum_crafting_bug_and_camp/) [different](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dd1k1e/gun_breaks_right_after_i_repair_it_bugglitch/) [threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dc30so/crafting_mutation_serums_on_pc_doesnt_work/), and through investigation found that if you take **all** of your Ultracite and Nuclear Material out of your Stash and then put it back in, that should help resolve the troubles you've been having with crafting, repairs, and object placement.
---
Can you give that a try and please let me know if it helps to fix any of these issues? Thanks very much!
---
That's pretty much what server hopping is.
---
If the workshop is unclaimed, it is "contested" by anyone in the zone but they have to shoot to initiate PvP. 
---
They most likely contested, shot them but didn't shoot you.
---
Just built an ultracite power armor without issue
---
It's at the top of Character Challenges.
---
More because they don't know the difference of hating something enough be worthy of visible disagreement &amp; just disliking and staying neutral to an idea or opinion.
---
I don't typically judge someone based on what they like or dislike, just the person they show me.
---
PA definitely effects sneak negatively.
---
AI cannot "see" through invisibility, it just doesn't work like it does against humans. Those invisibility features simply make you sneakier. There's no such thing as echolocation when it comes to enemies, it's just all up to their PER and how high it is.
---
So yes, it's definitely possible to sneak around enemies and hit them without being spotted. It seems like you've maybe just never had a melee sneak build.
---
The point is that you don't even need sneak. A lot of people have good enough DR for Bloodied melee during SBQ, so SS is always amazing no matter what.

 &gt; Hi and thanks for your reports recently. We've been looking into the issues you've mentioned across [a few](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dcy...
---
Yeah waiting also, have 10 bloodies chef outfits, 6 grill master chef hats, one tenderizer and had plans but decided to learn them instead of selling them. Cant wait to see what they will go for in a bit.
---
The main problem I have is PvP is it can ruin PvE, group up with these guys? Are they gonna help kill stuff or have someone get flagged so Im flagged?
---
Some stuff that I would recommend is running serpendity in luck and dodgy in AG it truly makes a difference when playing at low health
---
Plungers!
---
They will do a good fallout, fallout 76 it's just an experiment (a failed one), sorry if playing the game I bother you, but I like it.
---
Accuracy? Honestly? Dear sir do you not realize you are on Reddit? Who ever heard of such nonsense. 
---
;)
---
PC and Win10. Maybe the easiest is SLOBS? I'd just hate to take a significant drop in frames in order to run it of course.  
---
I should note I am not doing any streaming. It is just for me to review my own performance in Nuclear Winter and to adjust my strategy to get better etc.
---
It's supply and demand. Selling out of your vendor, your demand is low because your market visibility is very small. Selling on the trading sites, your market visibility is massive, and so if you have a valuable item, the big spenders will spend what *they* feel is it's worth, and they all compete with each other, so the maximum value is quite high.
---
I prefer to go with "confused"... 
---
If it's adults acting like this I would be more concerned.
---
I need The Law , a higher level player kept stabbing me at events during meat week and the game would offer me 50 caps to stab him back. I would then he/she or other players would decimate me . Maybe I'm just a noob who doesn't fully understand the PVP system, but I was pissed , he/she got me like 4 times. But they Iniated it every time and didn't get a Bounty. Was confused.
---
This is an old idea. There are videos on YouTube
---
"Judge the man, not the soul"
---
Fireproof will take care of it. Endurance perk.
---
This by far is the funniest thing I have ever seen built lol. Launch them at the Scorch Beast Queen. Maybe she will be your friend lol
---
I did the same and have not seen any Ultracite armor mod plans on sale.
---
"Confused"?... Yeah "confused" is a better way to say it, actually is the right way to say it.
---
1000 would be more than enough.
---
Thanks so much.
---
Huge help! Thanks
---
Yup. Only scorched i have so far are Scorched and Scorchbeast. 
---
I just killed the SBQ and all the mobs around her so i know for a fact i killed at least 5 different scorched.
---
Me too
---
Shotguns. Even with all the Perk Cards, not so good for damage. Very fun trying out different Legendary Effects etc though. Combat Shotgun only though. Good for crippling then switching to another weapon. I reckon they'll buff them soon, plus Laser/Plasma durability. Or are we getting a total re-balance for Wastelanders?
---
What?!  A bugged challenge?!
---
Don't mention it, is what vault dwellers should do.
---
I listed H1Z1 because i know what working on a shitty game is like. A shitty game very similar to this game. Do you? Do you have any idea what you're talking about? we had backlogs of bugs logged that were never fixed by the time the cancelled the contract with our studio. Literally hundreds of bugs never addressed. An FQA team logs the bugs, they don't fix them. A buggy shitfest can have the best FQA team in the world, but if the Devs don't implement them, there's no progress. The exact same team went on to work on Rock Band 4 with no issues getting all major bugs fixed.
---
Cause they don't probably don't exhaustively test it...
---
There called Brahmin, not Cows.
---
Yeah I dont know I'm sure they dont want to lose u but there is NW and that is strait up PVP u dont like that?
---
Shotguns use to be so OP but then they nerf them truth be told I don’t know what they’re going to re work next and I feel like not enough say stuff for them to actually do something about it or they just don’t care
---
Im a melee player for the most part. 
---
Simply use assaultron electrified sword and at night i use the nocturnal sski sword which dishes nearly 200 damage. 
---
Gun wise, i simply run with shotguns. Using gatling guns, etc make the easy game play way too easy
---
The game is so easy, the only power armour i use is a level 45 excavator suit with calibrated shocks for a carry weight of 600.
---
No worries... I just try and stay positive... too much negative and hate in the world... it’s also a game and some people hate this game like it killed their families or something... or started a real nuclear war... it’s crazy...
---
Yeah, two shot isn't terrible on heavies or shotguns since the second slug is likely to land. It's really bad on rifles, particularly in VATS. The second shot almost never lands, so you're doing less damage than a non-legendary.
---
I believe you can find most of the patch notes on their site. Not sure how far back they go.
---
I farm the queen several times a day. I’m not on now but plan on doing more queens and a few encrypted later. Gt is same as here.
---
Care to share or give some pointers on your method/ farming route?
---
1. Some quest may fail to complete.
---
2. Some NPCs maybe hostile to u by accident, unabeling you to finish/start their quest.
---
3. New items added might fail to show up in thr legendary vendor.
---
4. Phrame rate issue and possible crash issue with instancing cells.
---
5. Failure for some dialog options yo register regardless of your stats.
---
6. Legendary perks may not work as intended.
---
7. NPC may fall off the map.
---
8. Random 3 Scorchbeast may come attack the settlement, making all outside npcs die, thus causing failure on multiple quest.
---
9. Some of the new items or weapons may have animation bugs/broken values.
---
10. Because of the new instancing tech, you might loose all your equipment and gear.
---
11. We are begging for budget increase on camps and stash, and that is never happening.
---
12. A giant surge of new players will arrive, only to fail all the public events, forcing you a respectable 300+ level player, to waste your time.
---
13. Wastelanders will most approximatly be 20 hours long.  After the hype, ull go back to whitesprings 2 farm ghouls again.
---
14. To prevent #13, bethesda might rework the entire whitespings and remove the ghouls from there.
---
The endurance perk fireproof helps. Also putting the dense mod on torso armor helps. I have both and still kill myself sometimes though. Lol
---
When pigs fl-  So sorry, when *cows* fly
---
Fireproof found in END and in terms of armor mods I recommend dense
---
Great job building into the terrain.  Looks super!!!  I didn’t see Murgle the cat, is she in your camp?
---
As someone who did not spend real world money, but rather around 6 months or more of grinding and trading to get my full sa set, yeah a little burned
---
WTF is prop hunt?
---
You need to let them hang over the edge a bit to connect the wire from the bottom then slide them in.
---
If you're a group to run the vault with - the Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter (PC) is always looking for new recruits. 
---
I've found 5x+ brown, blue &amp; green, 2x pink, 3x Forrest, 1x yellow and 0 red. I don't go there every day but that's what I've found in the last few months or so.
---
Your doing it wrong don't shoot unless your cornered there no time for that.
---
Nuka grenades too
---
Yep.  Found one at a player vendor for 1500 caps and scooped it up right away.  Don’t have the prime receiver but it’s awesome w/heavy perks and SBQ
---
Yeah what a ...Blast... Don't ya?
---
Hating on haters makes you one of them, I try to not as often as I can.
---
Do you not have that kind of thing with your graphics card software?
---
Explore the whole map, find all the locations.
---
Oh yes I think I have become slight insane now, I thought I’d maybe never leave the asylum lol
---
What is straight of PvP? I do enjoy that, Survival was awesome.
---
And I don’t really like NW, I mean it’s okay. But I’m not a huge battle royal fan, and I enjoy the RPG feel of the main game.
---
Yeah don't reduce your self to the hater level, stay where you are.
---
Och, they're always fixing things, then break something else along the way. They are trying though. People forget the things they fix.
---
Yeah the red is there to haunt us all lol
---
I would get the armored first and carry that and a regular. Then get the high capacity.
---
&gt; NPC may fall off the map.
---
ahahah, i wouldn't be surprised
---
15 Flying scorchbeasts aggro wastelanders making them mass migrate from their settlement.
---
Newest glitch issue i seen after this lat update / patch is everytime i cook all my wood ends up back in my invantory vs staying in my stash.
---
Yep, I gave up and bought it once I saw someone selling it in their vendor. It will haunt me forever though until I find my very own in the asylum.
---
Restart computer. Verify installation in the launcher. Remove mods.
---
I sell all plans for 10 caps each. Visit my store today for those low, low prices.
---
Bet you never want to go there again lol.
---
What...and I stress this.....da fuq?
---
How many bramin were injured during the making of this video?
---
Deff not 50k... Shotguns aren't popular since the nerf and Assault Rifles are inferior to Combats and Handmades (apart from visually imo). He could maybe get a few extra k between them but those are fair prices.
---
Even guys who sell rare but replaceable stuff for cheap seem to draw the line at selling legacy weapons cheap.
---
My cows are gonna be somebody someday. \*Brahmin loved that.\*
---
short version: one team turns into various objects that can be found in the world and hides, the other team must destroy them before their hp runs out.
---
Awesome bunker, Brother. If you're looking for a group to run with:
---
The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter (PC) is always looking for new recruits. 
---
That's what I was hoping to do, get the color to match perhaps haha. Sadly I've got nothing, guess I'll have to wait for a patch to come out.
---
I feel it aswell invantory is over 1k and stash at max. But cant sell anything till tomorrow. And god knows ill still be over weight for a week. Till i can get all stuff sold.
---
Most of my characters sit around 600 lbs in their stash and want for nothing.  
---
Increasing the limit would cause more lag and worse performance.  
---
If anything they should lower it.
---
I have made two, yes two, characters in survival, nothing but survival. Never moved to adventure to farm, fix or level up. They are both primed for survival, for pvp. Survival is gone, so I intend to bring the pvp wherever I go.
---
You get what you get.  Stop asking for handouts.  Aren't you embarrassed to behave like that ?
---
I killed two scorched sloths yesterday and neither counted.
---
Yeah I’m with you there I hate that too. Especially with high levels they should know better! You get your hopes up thinking there’s gonna be 20 legendary weapons to pick from and it’s all non legendary pipe rifles, awful!!
---
I'm referring to all 3 weapons combined, that's easily about 50k they're losing out on.
---
Shotguns were never nerfed.
---
AR is only completely inferior to Handmade, but is still better than CR in fire rate.
---
Those effects are definitely very valuable and could net 10-20k.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Myron would have never thought of a delivery service like this for his Jet.
---
Win 10 should have Xbox Game Bar. Mine is enabled by default and is accessed in game by pressing win+g at which point I get an overlay that allows me to do all sorts of things, including record video. I have only tested it a little but did not notice an fps drop while using it. 
---
If it doesn't seem to be enabled for you check the options in System -&gt; Gaming -&gt; Game bar
---
The NVIDIA Geforce Experience also offers similar functionality.
---
I noticed something like this. I had a three star lever rifle. It had quad ammo, +30 scorthed damage, and +1 perception.
---
Not sure if it happened when I put paint on it or added a wtf the mod was that took a bunch of flux to make for additional scortched damage, but now it only has quad ammo capacity. It's still a decent gun, but went from being worth 40 skript to only worth 5 now. Kinda made me mad. It was my best pervaoyer purchase too.
---
Just ran this two times with him. Great guide, thanks again.
---
I've sold them for 1500. They're fun. If you ever get a TS faster fire reduced weight that's worth about 10K. Those TS agl's are awesome for blanketing an area with indirect fire for fun.
---
 LOL. Three fireproof and Heavy Combat with a Dense Torso and I can stand on a car and blow it up. I actually do suffer some damage that way. I suspect its ballistic from stuff flying around.
---
Shoot.  I was on. Ill prob be on again soon
---
Problems being identified and problems being fixed are two very different things.
---
 I dunno, puts reflex sights on my new char's Hunting Rifle OK. ;)
---
Oh, I... I didn't meant to hurt anyone, sorry, click the down vote if you want, I deserve it. And take your time enjoy the things you enjoy.
---
I hope that you can spare me some day.
---
This sale was supposed to be the special random box for a reduced price but there were issues when they launched it so they pulled it and gave us a flat 25% off for compensation. The better sale is later in the month (17th I believe) and potentially can become a 50% off sale.
---
Well being that I am a labeled "survival reject" I am finding that I have to rely on the reports here of all the hurtful actions myself and my kind have brought upon the innocent adventure players. It was silly I know, but I really really hoped those reports were true of people getting unexpectedly killed when a workshop was contested and they neither owned or were grouped with the owner at the time.
---
Maybe I was just doing it wrong.
---
Can i get one?  I'm trying hard to find the plans,  but no luck
---
The problem arises when you use full assassin's/sentinel **and** stealth boys. You are effectively countering the counter to your build with a hard counter to there's.
---
The issue is, players who do not want to deal with vats have an answer. You pop a stealth boy, you win. If I am a vats critical build, I do not want to deal with stealth boys. I have no answer. The best play is to leave the fight and find someone else.
---
If stealth boys are not nerfed, the game comes down to who has the better legacy explosive weapons. Because then that is the only way to get damage in. My guns do less than 80 damage per shot. After all the damage reduction in the game, they can never kill anyone. They are only able to kill after stacking sneak, head shot, and critical multipliers.
---
Amen!
---
Well, if your interested you can blueprint a staircase and keep jumping off and switch off reviving eachother with a buddy. Revives are worth a good chunk and you get whatever survival xp you earned. Not saying I've done this, but it works
---
With the current limit and my 1 strength character I’m able to manage just fine—even with 35-45 Legendary items stashed away for sale or storage. I’d love to see another 200 lbs, but not at the expense of stability. 
---
Once your CAMP is built and you have your weapon/armor situation under control, there’s just really no reason to be hoarding all the crap people hoard in this game. If you’ve got hundreds of lbs of junk, you’re just a masochist. You will never use it, you only have that much because you don’t use it in the first place. Sell it off and be free.
---
Gotta kill alllll the scorched to get the 50% off.
---
Omg this happened to me about an hour ago and I was the one who started the god damn thing!
---
If ur on ps4 I have a bunch I think 10 of each not cheap 500 each which is still cheaper than farming t unless ur melee build then u dont spend any caps on ammo.
---
The original lvl 6 was nowhere near the workshop. I saw this guy moving in so I closed in hoping he would do exactly what he did. I was counting on behavior and claims that have been posted here in fo76 in all of the anti survival player threads. Thus, the point and intent of my post is that such claims are absolute BS.
---
Nice job I like it
---
It wasn't pain, I realized my error, and I accept it. Well you have a good night or day. 😃
---
The worst part is that after they put it in the RNG list of Public Events, long cooldown (40 minutes ish) there's another layer of RNG. It has to be night time when the Public Events on your server reset. Because One Violent Night, Campfire Tales and The Path of Enlightment only spawn at night.
---
They said they will reduce the amount of time for Public Events from 40 mins to... half? 20 mins. But in my opinion this won't solve the main issue. Sooner or later they will add newer Public Events to the list, and that will make even the simplest event (such as tea time, swarm of suitor, feed the people, etc that required for a daily challenge) harder to find.
---
Yeah some just see all the bad and some all the good it’s hard to stay in the middle sometimes
---
I died right as I killed the wendigo in One Violent Night, and I couldn't respawn. Just stared bitterly at the screen as the camera lazily turned in a circle over my corpse, watching the other players emoting and checking for their sweet loot. I don't want to say it was the worst thing to ever happen to anyone, but it might have been.
---
You can buy a recall circuit board and trigger it. Better do it when there are a bunch of high level players on the servers. All the recent ones I’ve joined failed. Most players are clueless.
---
I doubt this will be an official thing, but once official mod support comes it shouldn't take long for this to be a thing.
---
I got 500 lbs in only scrap If I have a limit on 2000 i  would probably have about 1500 lbs in only junk
---
Yeah I'm holding out to sell tenderizer, bloodied chef outfit and grill master hat. I dont mind waiting just to get a couple caps more...lol
---
True fact man.
---
You know what else is a mystery pick? Lol...Every Legendary Enemy in the game...dont waste your scrip.
---
Cool, the community needs to do more things like this.
---
Can the fixer drop as blooded
---
I’m not that happy about the bugs, modders and problems either.. but what do you want them to actually do/say? 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Most of the staff on here aren’t devs and with that being said - they can’t just fix your issues on the spot. Trust me, if you’ve ever seen an actual dev workspace you’d understand that patches get flagged in order of priority and it’s not as easy as fixing a line of code and hitting “submit”. Patches take time to push through each platform, problems exchange hands within the teams regularly. All in all, it’s probably been a very shitty year to be a community manager for Bethesda because of all the people here grasping for someone to blame and they’re out here trying to interact with this community all while knowing it’s hostile. It’s also not their fault the chiefs, directors and higher ups released this before it was ready. Do you blame the cashier for running out of a previously stocked item?
---
Ice Breaker was always the superior exotic
---
Someone suggested starting the quest and not finishing it, and that worked for me.
---
Nice! I can’t wait to rank up to my max potential
---
I checked your perk set up and saw you’re not running bandolier. you don’t have any trouble with ammo weight? Also how many do you carry?
---
So... pick up the body but don’t bury it??
---
remove the word 'exhaustively' from that statement and you have it bang on the money !
---
Check on fallout 76 markets for someone to add dense to your chest/torso armor. Difficult to find in the wild, but worth it overall.
---
No issues with ammo weight at all. I typically carry around 10k ultracite. It doesn’t weigh that much compared to the saving from traveling pharmacy. Meds are HEAVY.
---
I might raise mine then. It’s a grind to make them and like you said they need them for showers and such. I find they sell better then serums.
---
I like the idea of writing graff all over Appalachia. That should be fun. I might get really into that.
---
Juice head spreads a lot of misinformation. Not a fan.
---
Vanguard and assassin cant be together
---
Edit: unless you mean something like 3 parts vanguard and 2 parts assassin
---
I do enclave officer uniform, mask and combat helmet and to me it looks really cool, I blacked out my helmet also. If ur on ps4 I have an extra combat helmet I can black out for u and give u for free if u want it.
---
Thought the same thing😂
---
May I suggest calling it the [Trepanator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trepanning)? Remember folks, don’t drill a hole in your head!
---
I did say community manager didn't I? Its their job to talk to us. I want a video tour of the austin division. I want them to be more engaged in the good and the bad threads, not just the good, and don't just say "the team is looking into it". I want them to talk about the internal logic of the decisions they make, since to me it feels like they don't even play the game. Im not asking much, just for them to do their job and be passionate about it. I want more than PR speak, I want them to show us they have a soul.
---
The left leg is the chest is heavy, arms and one leg medium and the last leg is light.
---
Society, and the current state of the worlds younger generations. 
---
If this offends you, then this comment is about you.
---
Sorry if someone thinks that this post is too controversial, I will soon post the kind of post that I most like, but I need to express myself sometimes, maybe I don't speak for all the community but... Can we all just get along with other communities?
---
Hope to see you tomorrow
---
If I ever found your camp with God rolls for 5k, I'd buy your entire stock.  Are you on PC, I want to know for reasons
---
They have plenty of time, because if they didn’t, they would use their free time to enjoy life doing stuff like playing games.
---
Don’t mind them, it’s IMPOSSIBLE for the internet to agree.
---
I sell serums for 500 also and certain ones sell better than others. Yeah raise it not worth the hassle for us to grind it out and all they do is stop by and pick it up. Always figure ur time spent when selling something. It's like speciality outfits, I could be playing the game running quest but instead I'm spending my time server hopping just for an outfit. Just saying ur time is worth something.
---
Looks fun
---
Did all that 😔hopefully support will know what to do
---
if your going for a full health build, ditch the assassins for Vanguards.
---
Assassins is only viable if you are PVP focused.  And since PVP is currently dead, its useless.
---
Lol my bad vanguard cavalier sorry
---
Emergency protocols helps a lot.
---
This.  
---
I hate carrying half empty cores around too, they are weight sponges.
---
A lot don’t think of it like that but anything I grind for is worth making my pockets rattle with caps. Now if it’s a legendary that’s crap like the 3* batons I keep getting, 500-1000. But if it’s a 1* it goes for scrip. We work to hard to give stuff away.
---
I'm gonna log in one day and be like ; "My, what a wonderful day in Appala-OH MY GOD WHERE DID THIS DEAD BRAHMIN COME FROM ?!?!"
---
Yeah my bad its vanguard cavalier
---
Anything I grind for is worth making my pockets rattle with caps. Now if it’s a legendary that’s crap like the 3* batons I keep getting, 500-1000. But if it’s a 1* it goes for scrip. We work to hard to give stuff away.
---
Why would you do PvP in a game with built in aim bot? Aka VATS?
---
+ perk system that allows weapons to do ridiculous amounts of damage.
---
I agree.  Most of the guys I played with back during beta (I still play other games with them), they haven't touched the game since then only my brother and I have.  I still enjoy it, its just really lack luster right now.
---
Could be ok for PvP, depending on your loadout, but I doubt it's something for PvE.
---
Times were simpler then
---
Yeah I have no problem helping low level players but stuff I grind for I wont give away.
---
Yeah sorry it vanguard cavalier
---
you mean everyone running around flatwoods trying to slap damage kill people because gamers are mean?
---
IT WAS GLORIUS!
---
Bro. Stash used to be 400
---
Keep it, thats the go to setup for Vanguard.
---
If you have a full set, people will get jealous.
---
Yeah they suck now..I have a AAE lvl50 3 star and it kinda sucks.
---
As a person who regularly hits the vendor cap limit and still picks up hundreds of caps each day...you can totally proc it once a day per person.
---
That would lead to exploits where people just store their ammo, excess fusion cores etc in vending and put them up for 30k each so no one buys them.
---
Yeah I don’t have them I have two handed melee build, got my self a bloodied supersledge
---
Fireproof should be all you need, but mod your chest peice with Padded or Dense (dense is the high end version of padded, but padded works just fine if you have Fireproof)
---
I can stand next to a wall and unload a TSE mini into it, and not take damage.  The same is true for my Handmade, Combat Rifle, Lever, 10mm (I like explosive guns)
---
The only thing that kills me now is my TSE Gat Plas, they are brutal.
---
Unless your shooting a legacy energy explosive weapon, Fireproof and Padded mod on your chest should be all you need.
---
I miss the old menu screen. It felt like music that a fallout in West Virginia would have.
---
OP what system you on, PC? If so what's your GT?

Yeah not selling. I have 3 sets of armor, my main armor which is scout all polymer deep pocketed, then I have a set of assassin heavy combat armor set up for stealth and this vanguard set, all max lvl 3 star. Would like a full set of unyielding but have never come across any max level. Maybe someday we will see..
---
This definitely helps me a lot. Very detailed post and writing format, thank you!
---
im hoping it comes back when they get public events working right, most of the time i see it now is at queens.  i dont even see any type of working together at arktos, just a ton of "kill __ALL__ the deer"
---
I believe that was me, I just got it from Murmur and I didn’t need it so up it went. I dont try to take anyone and I think my prices are very fair. I really dont need any caps most times so try to keeps prices low. I am the same build and having a nice melee that you can use instead of bullets now and then is a nice thing! :)
---
I have a Vampires pickaxe up now, not my cup of tea but someone I’m sure will want it, it was too nice to scrap in the hopper just for scrip...
---
Thanks, I have this and will try it out.
---
Well my friend if that was u thank u u have made my game playing a 100 times better, I really appreciate it.
---
Unyeilding is really hard to find, since everyone wants it.  Even if they dont rock bloodied, it comes in handy for vendor runs for the stat boost to CHA.
---
I put my Vanguards set together about 6 months ago, around the time I started working on my Unyeilding.  Im still missing one peice (i have a 1\* for my right arm that is holding the place for whenever I find the 3\*)
---
Thank you. I like your writing format.
---
Glad I could help! It has become why I am in game now mostly :)
---
Yep. I’ve got one.
---
Anything that I like for the different build I use from time to time on different characters. I’m an Universal soldier. :)
---
Fireproof perk and put a dense torso on your armor.
---
Since doing this I've never got killed by my explosive weapons
---
Taking about script, I was at almost 1000 the other day when they had that deal for 70 script and it's a roll of the dice each time I got crap what do I need a hunter lvl 50 3 star shovel for dumbest weapon I've seen, I used it to go bury the soldier at for picket then killed a couple of ghouls with it. Such a funny weapon.
---
I didn’t dispute that they’re a community manager and I didn’t dispute it wasn’t their job. Like I said what do you want them to do/say? They’re interacting with people who post problems letting them know they’re aware and they’re also on posts like this. They can’t really say much more than “they’re looking into it”, as they’re not devs and it’s a totally separate team. I’m a dev (not of Bethesda) and I could tell you what the entire process is like for this kind of situation.
---
Tell them you want a video tour then, suggest your ideas but don’t get mouthy with the staff. No one is going to take you seriously. If you came at me like you did the CM above, I wouldn’t obligate myself to respond to you. Would you want to be confronted that way if you were in their position? They’re doing what they can, they’re not going to hate on their company’s game and they’re taking the community feedback back to the other teams to collaborate on. They can really only gather intel and interact with us on posts like these, which I feel is presenting that they do indeed have a soul. They could just respond to problems and call it a day and that would technically be sufficient but I often see them going above and beyond here. There’s a documentary that shows their offices and workspaces from another game they developed in the past, I’ll try and find it but it was before Bethesda got flooded with reviews on YouTube.
---
I totally agree with you on the game though, I’m not happy and I feel awful for playing it on day one. I wish I wouldn’t have bought it. It tainted my opinion quite a bit until I picked up for the first time since November finally last month. I’m blaming the higher ups, they knew the state of things.
---
I had a camp there once. Pretty annoying when the enemies spawn halfway up the windmill stairs inside your house though!
---
Yeah I used to throw all of those away, then we get those quests and I am running around looking for a stupid shovel for hours! :) I still have yet to need to kill anything with a pool queue though... :)
---
Are u on ps4? If u are I will keep an eye out for u.
---
I would love to but I won’t have any time to play for the next week and a half.
---
I run the high cap now and it has been great, I dont mind the lowered rad resistance because I am now a bloodied build anyway so it helps....
---
50% is still coming, but we need to slaughter a bunch of scorched to unlock it.  
---
So get to whitesprings, big bend tunnel, and morgantown.
---
Anyone drink lead champagne beforehand?
---
This is what I do, I use the excavator as my truck. This was its original intent anyway.
---
Lol well there is always one at morgontown airport in the garden. I really hate that event going off as soon as I log in...lol I've done it twice now and still get the event announcement when I log in. So annoying
---
Personally I don't think it would be hard for console players, but aren't PC updates shipped earlier? could cause some problems there, otherwise I imagine it's as easy as switching what server the game client points at, since i very heavily doubt they're using platform-dependent servers.
---
The rad damage is great if you have ghoulish equipped
---
Plenty of time to save up scrip again by then, take full advantage now.
---
I sell things in my vendor cheap and not many people buy it, only think I do high price are my serums as I only have three recipes and trying to save up to get more as they are expensive to get still only 620 for a serum, which is a pain to make as I have only run into trouble and issues when trying to gather ingredients for them.
---
I sell mine for 100 caps each since you can break them and learn the plan yourself then.
---
Its gonna be a tesla fest lol.
---
I heard on another thread on here that scorched gulpers work. But I've not checked yet.
---
????
---
That's the endgame here, and how I got my Legacies.
---
Vendor hopping is by far the best farming method. I have no luck with drops, but vendor hopping is on a whole different level.
---
If you want to have an idea of what vendor hopping looks like, check this out -  [https://imgur.com/a/efBQCOn](https://imgur.com/a/efBQCOn) ( I don't have any of the weapons anymore, all sold).
---
QE Harpoon cost me a whooping 400 caps! Most expensive was BE lever for 25k caps, others average around 5-10k caps each
---
As in, click for Fast Travel and....
---
Disconnected. 
---
(Always looking for stable flux. 400 junk in a vendor is a good place to look)
---
It does suck no doubt  to build for shotguns then the nerf, but dont call for something else to have the same thing happen to it. While we're at it you could say nerf gamma guns, handmades etc.
---
Not until you eat all your supper.
---
I'd rather loose 200 stash and gain 25% more camp budget. But that's just me.
---
You don't need to own every single thing in the game, don't become a hoarder and end up dead in your own filth.
---
I remember when we had 400! 'When I were a lad...' etc
---
Thank you! This thread is getting saltier by the minute so I'm just going to move on.
---
Oh there was also that great but where if your companions had weapons you gave them.... And you went into the strip... The weapon disappeared. 
---
Or the make a random not or creature essential bug. 
---
Or the console glitch where vendors inventories never changed. Ever. 
---
Or the Karma bugs ...
---
While NV is one of my favourite entries in the FO setting, it is just as rife with bugs, clipping issues, load and Dave problems as any other FO/ES game. Easily.
---
If you didn't encounter game/quest breaking bugs, then you didn't play it  near its release. If you say otherwise, you're lying. 
---
And if you're skeptical? Simply Google New Vegas game breaking bugs..... And enjoy the hilarity.
---
Berserker is great in a hazmat suit in a nuke zone. Probably the best place they shine to honest. All of the other builds rely on armor effects or low health which is hard to maintain.
---
I drop mine if I accidentally change magazines in my plasma gatling. I saved them at one point went up against an enemy and only had those half used cores and was changing mags every second so effed up. I wish they would do the same thing they do with magazine changes but at same time understand why it wouldn't work.
---
For most effects the highest benefit is at below 20% (so 19% and below). But most effects still give benefits at other tiers (ie 20-39%).
---
No actually, missed opportunity
---
&gt;Like I said what do you want them to do/say?
---
Did you not read what i said?
---
&gt;Would you want to be confronted that way if you were in their position?
---
I'd be ashamed of doing such a poor job.
---
Im not getting paid to tell them how to do their job.
---
Its abysmal that indie companies have done such a great job with revealing that kind of information, but this multi-billion dollar company can't. Look at GGG. Often post office pictures, often talk about how the code works in the background, often talk on reddit, often make statistics for us, make community contests, release manifestos with "making of"s, often interview players and hire them and often talk about the decisions they made with the game and what went right or wrong and why.
---
There's just no passion here. Do you think a CM job is just to answer people once a week?
---
&gt; I wouldn’t obligate myself to respond to you. 
---
The same way I don't feel obligated to be nice for wasting 60€ on this mess.
---
Show some passion, that is all.
---
The challegne has to be 3 Diffrent Types.
---
I.e ( A scorched , scorchbeast And A Scorched Megasloth.)
---
+there is a list of certain enemies that work and what dont
---
I think its still for sale on the atom store aswell. Wankers.
---
Ah I see know. I’m the same for 5:56 ammo. However 20,000 ammo in a vendor usually turns out to be 14k .38, 5k .44 and 1k syringer ammo lol
---
I hadn't thought about this... but you're right. Everybody sprinting to the Flatwoods church quest marker. It was all so *exciting*.
---
Big Bend, Whitesprings, Morgantown.    Get to the slaughter
---
Too true!!
---
Nay, im on XBox.  Im also a weirdo and use leather unyeilding.
---
Cringe post bro
---
Yeet!
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Unyeilding, Bolstering and Bloodied.  These are your low health perks.
---
Bloodied starts working as soon as you take damage, and caps out when you hit 19%
---
Unyeilding increases when you hit 79% 49% and 19% respectively
---
Im not 100% on Bolstering, but I do know it caps at 19%
---
basically low enough that nerd rage procs but as high as possible at that level
---
I don't remember this, but I was "re-downloading" the game on day one of the BETA lol
---
They were super quick to nerf the shotguns. Even if they put them back to normal you would still have no chance against a Tesla and most laser rifles
---
NW is about survival, so get under that house and hide.
---
Ahh, back when things were shiny and new... memories
---
Or even pre-vending / pre-scrip when you'd find Legendaries just tossed to the ground or stuffed in the ice box outside of Whitespring Golf Club. When people cooperated and bartered outside the Atrium shops. And you couldn't simply ignore griefers because they had slap damage back then.
---
How things have changed :-)
---
Don't you all have motion aiming tho? seems like it, quote "wouldn't be fair."  
---
Unless bethesda was too lazy to implement that, which tbh I wouldn't put past them.
---
Isn't it close to impossible to do pvp in adventure?
---
Okay,
---
Not really man, the old tse shotguns were insta death
---
afaik the lowest you need to go for max effect is 19.9% as below that there is no more gain.
---
If you are on PC get " improved health bars" that will give you a numbered read for your health, not that shite that Beth implemented.
---
Yeah when my stash gets full of building materials I’ll bulk it up and take what I can spare to a low lvl camp but I check first to see if it’s a person with a second or third build. They don’t need it and you can usually tell by what they have at their camp. My second and third has stuff from the atom shop and usually I have rare outfits on. I went once to drop some off and the guy had the words on his camp wall “ not a low lvl” I guess so ppl like us don’t bring him stuff or PvP him. I rolled on. That was smart of them though.
---
no matter, same answer because of the  assassin prefix. It's useless in PvE.
---
I have so many challenges left, how do you only have get to level 100? Holy moly.
---
Got an AA FFR RW railway for 1k caps a few weeks ago
---
The challenge is bugged, only scorched and scorchbeast register.
---
I placed the body but didn't bury it.
---
How does stash limit correlate to game content?
---
Are you trying to save one of each type of junk without scrapping it for collecting purposes? That is the only quasi-reasonable scenario I could see...
---
If you're scrapping things, then get better organized because there is no legitimate reason to sit atop a mountain of redundant shit that you're not using.
---
Definitely use the fletchette mod, turns it into a shotgun type gun. It also practically gives you unlimited ammo since you can loot more harpoons than you use
---
Make sure you have actually joined the scorched earth event or you may still drop loot and/or start pvp - I.e. if you fast travel to a site right next to the nuke zone to avoid rads you may not actually join the event even though you are in there with everyone else.
---
The well known waterfall location in the Mire - northwest of the Treehouse village and east of the crashed plane  [https://imgur.com/a/BzJPPkv](https://imgur.com/a/BzJPPkv)
---
I think it might be due to high number of other players / enemies, so it takes a very long time to load. Happened to me several times when I died during the event. Last time it happened I just stayed on the loading screen for a bit and it eventually did load me into the world. It did take a long time though, and the event was over by then.
---
Its definitely bugged, saw a post earlier were they said they will look into, not that that means anything. I have killed several scorched megasloths, wendigos and yao guai and none of them registered.
---
Bloodied explosive heavy gunner
---
was a rifleman with a furious explosive handmade that focused on sneak attacks with full chameleon armor but ever since the purveyor gave me a bloodied explosive handmade ive switched over to a stealth commando with the chameleon armor still. nothing like being able to sneak right up to a crowd and have them never see you. before all this i did a powerfist strength build. so far most favorite has been the current stealth commando though. yea can die a lot but i am able to do a lot of damage to event bosses making fights end a lot faster and saves ammo for everyone else.
---
I really miss that. Finding amazing loot in a suitcase after a big queen fight.
---
Thanks fellow Steelers fan! I have noticed that too. I had like 11 random bolts in my inventory when I got the thing and within an hour or so had like 100 lol
---
Yeah that's cool. Help out where u can. You ever here of PKOA, that's what they are all about. I've only been a member a short time but it is a group of good people glad I joined them.
---
I agree 100%, except make it an endgame laser weapon like it was in classic Fallout. Low rate of fire but high damage or something like that!
---
I have three characters over level 100. I’ve never even seen someone wearing the red asylum dress. I’ve seen them on the marketplace for crazy trades though.
---
Seems to have worked for me. Still have the body in my inventory, only because I couldn't find the shovel. At least the quest doesn't trigger anymore.
---
will pay 20k for any legacies, even if it is a relatively bad one, like Stalkers explosive laser rifle.
---
I have a Quad Assault rifle- are you on PC?
---
Two factor random system:   
---
50% of the time it is 100% chance of limb damage.  
---
50% chance that there is an 82% chance of limb damage and the rest is divided among the other modifiers.  
---
Jokes aside (no really, that was just a joke...), I think most people think of random systems in games as each thing represented has the same chance as any of the other, when usually the worst outcomes have the highest chances of occurring and the best being the lowest chance.
---
It's probably because I put legendaries at 999, serums at 299, and if i am at camp i give away ammo. most of my plans are 49 and below.
---
Nah. Its okay though. Im kinda poor on caps anyway so I’d feel bad.
---
How about a low level whitesprings, that lasted till the end of the beta.
---
I wanna know too. I get stuck on one side of the door unable to open it because the keypad is on the inside instead of outside where I am trying to open it. Then if I switch it around I am on the inside while it is outside
---
Should be a good lvlr. Shotguns are great early-mid game with little or no perks. and also good for tagging mobs during events. Keep pasifst on tho or someone will kill you.
---
Hope they make assassins work on human npc if there are any in the update.
---
Children's toys are a great resource as most of them contain either plastic, screws or lead (or a combo of those) Even the wooden blocks have lead paint...
---
