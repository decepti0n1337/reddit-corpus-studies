No game with a pass system I have ever played required more than a few hours a week to max.  I'm sure they are out there, but they aren't that common, and they certainly don't seem like they would be fun to me.
---

---
No, you don't have to pay attention to it, but its simple introduction has lessened players ability to get new content the vast majority of which comes from the item shop.
---
I don't really see how offering opinions on the elements of the pass that seem problematic equals whining, I know anything critical to some people is whining, but I don't really get that.  If we don't offer feedback they won't make changes.
---
People WILL feel pressure to complete the pass, that's what passes are designed to do, and if they feel like its a big grind or it's not fun or rewarding they simply may just stop playing.
---
---
---
That‚Äôs uncalled for my guy. She‚Äôs a community manager, not a dev. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger.
---
Damn, I was expecting fusion cores on the list of stuff you could buy, that's a shame.
---
I had the same reaction, ghille suite would be nice but yea so not motivated at this point for same stuff. Didn't expect much so I'd say it met my expectations
---
Current system:
---
\-Easy to get atoms, you can get atoms every day and week.
---
\- You can get up to 6500 atoms in 3 months  with the current system.
---
\- You can get wathever you want with those atoms, adapted to your liking and playing style.
---
\- Incentive to log in every day and every week.
---
Season system:
---
\- You need to get to a specific rank to get atoms and it can takes you days to get any atom.
---
\-You will receive only 1500 atoms in 3 months if you complete the season... (currently until rank 90).
---
Every season has a thematic that you may or not like, you have to wait 3 months until it changes and you may not like the next one either.
---
\-At a certain point, many players won't log in because they won't be able to get more atoms so they won't have an incentive to log in until next season or content update.
---
\- Not enough atoms to buy a decent PA skin or pack in 3 months (sure, you will be able to buy some cheap skins or item packs but only after those 3 month and many of them cost +1500 so...)
---
\- Be glad if you can buy anything you like in the atomic shop after those 3 months because you will miss many offers.
---
\- You get PA skins when you may never use a PA, same applied to armor skins, so they're useless skins.
---
\- Even if you get 5 PA or armor skins, it's the same skin but slightly adapted for every PA or armor type, so in reality, you just get only one skin, only one (you should be able to get them in the same rank and  apply them to every PA or armor as many other  skins that we already have, it's a step back).
---
\- Some skins are just skins with a different colour that we already have and appear at the atomic shop...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So yeah, definitely it's a great improvement and nothing disappointing like the legendary card system....
---
Yeah I don't see a link either
---
Check your Misc tab to make sure it's actually in there.
---
I had to re-log during this quest, and apparently it didn't do a "Checkpointed" after I picked it up the first time, so I had to go back to the Pleasant Valley storage room and pick it up again.
---
I know the sink says water, but I doubt it‚Äôll be purified... if only we could hook it up to our water purifiers. And yeah the white raider mask looks cool but rank 92 for it? Yikes.
---
Lol same here.  That's why I nuke WS on private server on occasion.
---
Who mentioned 50+ hours? Wastelanders is the only ‚Äúproper‚Äù DLC added to the game. I definitely expected more quality than what we received. 6hrs followed by a horrendously boring grind - with a distinct lack of challenge. Yawn.
---
Can't you just use &amp; camp the computer until more folks arrive?
---
Oh yeah, cause you never kill a legendary enemy while playing public events. Or killing cryptids or w/e
---
Who uses each suit of power armor enough for that to be worth it?
---
If there is 1 person you get small waves, 2 people bigger waves etc.  Works the same as SBQ.
---
I think some of the new things are cool and all, but the items shop, the place where most new content gets released just became even more prohibitive, and now that the regular source of atoms in game has been dramatically lowered and the daily time requirement has been pretty largely increased with an included FOMO element... I don't think it's the right direction.

Here‚Äôs a link to my bloody unarmed build.

---
You‚Äôll want to make some changes if you have a junkie weapon, but it‚Äôs a jumping off point.
---
I recommend a small investment in an automatic rifle, because you‚Äôll need a decent ranged option sometimes.
---
Because Patriotism CANNOT be silenced!!!!
---
I have only launched 2 nukes so far and that was when I had someone to do it with.  How hard is it to solo silos?  Any tips?
---
I would like to MEAT Week plz..
---
Are cosmetics considered content? I really wouldn‚Äôt consider them content.
---
You can also trigger the big bend escort quest too for a gaurunteed 3* (usually more tho) every couple minutes. By the time you do 1 tho awol is usually up so just jump to that. Run through robco real quick. Continue w/e  route u usually run and then do big bend again. Plus the blue ridge swag is nnnoooiiiccceeeee once u get the while set
---
Anyone know if the electric chair is an atom shop item or do I need to find the plans?
---
Just FYI the order you equip some cards can affect the sneak bonus, too.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4le76/the_order_of_your_perk_card_affect_the_stealth/
---
That makes sense - also you might as well do as many of the dailies as you can to earn the maximum atoms before they disappear.
---
So what do you have to do to get tiers?
---
Well suposedly grinding XP also gets you score, I just found it interesting that you get just enough atoms to cover not doing weekly pvp
---
Buy it, then send a support ticket saying the silenced voice doesn‚Äôt work and that you want a refund, they will give you the atoms back and let you keep it.
---
Same as all alcohol
---
Poor man
---
Annoyed even though there really isn't anything to spend atoms on anyway.
---
Anything I have spent atoms on I've regretted like the cooler which is worse than useless, the collectron which I scrapped because it's nearly non-stop sound spam became intolerable, the wallpaper which turned out to look wet because they fucked up the graphics somehow etc.
---
Serendipity does NOT work in PA...
---
Hey you‚Äôre not alone, it‚Äôs my birthday too! üòÇ
---
Or Bethesda should fix it when it's been broken for months. It's a get around for weapons, but you can't inspect outfits or hats to see what they look like before buying
---
Agreed, I never participated in the PVP. I felt like it was out of place for the fallout universe.
---
Edit: I've done world PVP. But not the wannabe fortnite PVP.
---
This is the best- holyyy craaaap I‚Äôm just in awe... that‚Äôs so nuts it just might work
---
Yes, for life from EVERY game ever made...
---
You can‚Äôt trade secret service armour but yes it would if it was good unyielding
---
Are you trying to trade?  i thought the SS armor was not able to be traded between players.
---
It‚Äôs just a clean sink
---
As in it‚Äôs not dirty :)
---
As in it‚Äôs not a dirty sink, like we have in game currently :)
---
The raider vender at white spring usually has the plan for sale
---
Wait let me get this straight they are now asking for you to pay for FO1st AND a season pass now too?
---
Puuuuurfect name bravo!
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre asking since Secret Service Armor cannot be exchanged another player. 
---
And this sub really doesn‚Äôt allow bartering, so I recommend you find the ones that do for all your related bartering needs.
---
I love these!  I don't use alcohol but I know there will inevitably be the "consume X bottles of alcohol" so I always keep an assortment in my STASH (also handy for Biv's dailies).  Same with the pies/cakes/candies challenges and Sweetwater's find honey daily.  I used to also keep a store of beer bottles back in the day when we had to craft molotovs but I haven't seen that challenge in AGES!  I tend to do F/TV/SD challenges but there are times when I put on my big-girl pants and head into the Mire to do my dailies there!  I feel so brave!  lol
---
The new public teams will make it easier to complete challenges in a team, which will help out a number of solo players.
---
Are seasons out yet? I want to know so I don‚Äôt have to pause my fallout 4 just to check
---
Just a imaginary question
---
Should list your platform.
---
Apparently it spawns randomly at vendor bots
---
This!  Plus you can walk away with 100's of candy from doing just one event so it'll be a long time before you have to go back in!
---
I would want explosive.. 2 shot is lacking in the accuracy department... YMMV
---
Same  here, I am incredibly disappointed in their decision to remove daily atoms. Why would they even consider this besides being greedy? I am not a fan of the new rewards either, so much meh, lol.
---
I know that I‚Äôm just saying... they said it‚Äôll dispense water so I‚Äôm just telling you it probably won‚Äôt be purified, gonna be drinking more radiated water
---
Kinda, if someone has the armor and wants a b2525 sure. But any method to trade said armor is a glitch, and has a chance to fail and the armor can disappear, so is the chance you gotta give up a b2525 for a chance at the armor, knowing you might not get a full set if you dont time it just right worth it?
---
Can have both on the same minigun.....
---
June 30
---
Of course.  Cosmetics are rewards for going out there and doing shit in pretty much every game, mmo or singleplayer.
---
Gamma works great too. Only 3lbs and  a couple shots and im where i need to be.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt blame you... I‚Äôd like an actual release date on when it comes out, instead of being left in the dark like Bethesda always loves doing
---
I've been collecting bubblegum.
---
Yes hurry this weekend only.
---
Thanks
---
Hello :) not sure what you need a link for?
---
As a spooky addict I had to, heh.  It wasn't pleasant, and I even like NW fairly well.  :/
---
I‚Äôd love that but can‚Äôt find one.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm 99% sure they‚Äôre just for decoration or something, I‚Äôve never seen anything about them anywhere and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way in
---
Hey. Could you explain what you need a link for? This is an in-game service
---
Unless they haven‚Äôt fixed it, you could theoretically trade it via the legendary scrip things, but iirc they have fixed that and trying to trade it gets you banned from subreddits.
---
Almost any time you're required to repair a quest related item, it'll be at the tinker bench under craft, then quest items. Despite being told to repair it, you have to use the "craft" action.
---
Basically play the game. Daily and weekly challenges, normal xp, and public events.  Also spose to be adding more replayable content but I would count on it for this season.
---
Imo its easier solo. But to make it easy,  if u need to have 3 cards for picklock, and 3 for hacker, this way you can skip alot. And a good dmg gun. I one shot everything in there with my shotgun.
---
Awesome thank you
---
No
---
Legendary perks are their own set of ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù perk cards, but they delayed them to work on them more and do some balancing stuff as they are pretty trash.
---
Well..that's another thing I've not heard/read about.
---
Thanks... idk what to do then, cause I‚Äôve kind of messed up my perks and stuff
---
I don't have the plans but if you need one I have a level 30 Fixer you can have
---
Nah I already got $10 bucks from your mom
---
I love you for this idea.
---
Unless its 50 percent camp budget anything is better than nothing.
---
Why not just launch on prime and just wait the 30 minutes for Scorched Earth to fail and then you still have the nuke zone til it goes away. Never tried it but should work.
---
Once you got level 50 every level up aftwrwards let's you either move a special point or pick a perk card
---
Says ps4 help but i‚Äôll add it!
---
I hear you bud
---
People kept it secret and you can also have the chance to not see it, so it‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôll fail and destroy the piece and you aren‚Äôt able to get it so... and plus it‚Äôs glitch trading anyway.
---
I know that I just wanna be able to change my builds easily, but at level 79 it‚Äôs kinda difficult.
---
Nothing, you just won't have any reason to keep playing until next season or content update. With the current system you can at least get some atoms.
---
these days I spend more time throwing away and leaving behind than collecting.. but I dont base build
---
as long as Ive got mats to repair my gear and craft ammo.. Im good...
---
As someone who's roleplaying a character with a fascination for explosives, I'm gonna miss the free/cheap 40m grenades, missiles, and mininukes that people used to leave lying around.
---
Ss armor is so ugly i went back to wood
---
I‚Äôm genuinely more worried about them going the fortnite route and have a free battle pass and a locked battle pass for the first members and the free one having jack shit in it
---
Unless you wanted to start over (maybe wait for a double or triple XP weekend, the only way to add/subtract your SPECIAL points is every level after 50, you can choose a new card, or switch a SPECIAL point from one to the other.
---
Thank you
---
No way. That armor set can easily be acquired in a few hundred rolls of crafting. The Holy grail fixer is one in a million.
---
Pro-tip. Put all your reg stimpaks in your stash. Only carry superstims and run field surgeon, you'll have a much easier time tanking 3 pylons.
---
Happy Birthday!
---
I just went for one build, then saved my perks points.  That way I can change when i want. 
---
I'm bloodied now using heavy weapons, but have been thinking of converting to a junkies with melee or something just to mix things up.
---
I believe you can buy the plans for lever-action rifles from the responders bots in train stations, I got mine from one of the ash heap stations.  If you're lucky, you can get a decent rifle from the Rusty Pick, but 99% of the time I play the slots there I get garbage.
---
Good luck!
---
Happy Birthday to you too!
---
It‚Äôs gonna get blown into wood scraps and meat, not fro me but from a curious wastelander.
---
Ohhh thank you. Right now I‚Äôm using a melee build with my bloodied faster swing speed baseball bat, but am thinking about changing to my TSE 10mm Submachine Gun
---
Not really Given the exchange rate and cap.  For example 200 cannonballs at max will net you 156 308 rounds. A day. Yes it‚Äôs going to reduce some sales but hopefully it helps end all the twits who put up thousands of. 38 and just .38 for sale. If nothing else at least they will have a better use for them. Granted I suspect it will Also put and end to the fatman spam during Fasnaught.
---
Best Birthday Buddies!
---
I looked mate, but never saw PS4 on the title, the text, or the flair.
---
Big same. I can't wait.
---
Fun fact: Honey is fermented with water and other fruits/hops to create mead, a popular beverage in another Bethesda game!
---
-_- hey dad, I‚Äôm dad
---
Lits of cool stuff in here. Very excited!
---
Lol, I think it's going to do just fine.
---
New*
---
Bethesda just loves getting me hype and making me wait for long periods of time
---
Less choice more work
---
yeah I'm sitting on well over 100 unused perk points.  I really should do something with them.
---
As far as i know you can only do it once an hour.
---
Weird! Thanks for the update man!
---
For real. Nothing has sucked me in like this game has in a long time. I don't have as many hours as you, but I'm not too far off. üò¨
---
Thanks!
---
Lol
---
If your lucky enough you can bash certain spots and it will kill the robots. At least that's what I did
---
I've only worn outfits since I started rolling for the SS armor
---
Heads up on the log cabin, it is a prebuilt structure, like the seedy shed.
---
I prob have like 100 weight taken up in ammo. This is a blessing
---
My point is you would never need to spend that much (should be able to earn at least some levels), nor should you. The rewards aren‚Äôt that good lol.
---
Lol according to people I know, but I disagree. I just carry the nickname.
---
 VERY well together. Gives Sniper rifles a more ‚Äúreal‚Äù feel with the whole one-shot, one-kill.
---
I believe it's only 24 ppl per world, max.
---
Move on.  It sucks, but nothing can or will be done by Bethesda.
---
That‚Äôs not really terrible considering how common .38 is. I drop thousands of .38 every time I play. Any seasons weren‚Äôt in PTS. I don‚Äôt know how people could have data mined that.
---
What rate do you think is reasonable?
---
Always a good amount of people when I'm on. Usually don't notice them until a nuke drops.
---
Can I get a happy birthday on the 7th of July haha?
---
oh that would make sense, thank you for the reply.
---
Happy early birthday
---
My only nip pick on this is it is still a minor way to convert you cash to gold-script.
---
Nothing against people that want a dog in the game, but if you're gonna say "pet", I expect to see various choices of animals. Otherwise you may as well just put "dog trick" in the emote name.
---
I get lost in the place so ill have to look up a video on a walk-through.  If your ever down to nuke whitesprings send me a message. Ty for the tips
---
It's a minigun so its eh, I am not a fan of the mini but the explosive is fun on them. Demo expert does work to boost the damage. Two shot is fun with explosive but they're soooooo damn inaccurate, even with the stabilized perk while in power armor.
---
What system are you on and what level?
---
Edit: what was the lever in question.
---
Not a problem. Happy travels. :)
---
I agree about how this won‚Äôt hold up with how the dev team pushes out content.  If they keep having rewards like this I don‚Äôt see an incentive to grind or pay for it myself.  Just my thoughts.
---
Scrap all the junk.
---
Scrap/sell all the weapons and armor you don't need.  
---
Bulk junk and sell to vendor bots.
---
Keep around 100 or less of the various materials, especially those that you don't use.
---
Watch for things that eat up a lot of weight.  Get rid of the excess.
---
A while ago I met a player that had 200+ fertilizer in their stash.  It has it use, but it so easy to find/craft.
---
Have you tried Nuclear Winter? It‚Äôs a great 10-20min diversion when I want a FO fix but can‚Äôt seem to get into playing a full session.
---
The blood of communism says otherwise comrade. /s
---
5000 people playing on steam right now. 
---
24 per server.
---
Heh if you played wows or wot you get to see Bushcamping at its weirdest.
---
Seriously someone was basicaly trying to well island  camp with a Yamato Battleship. And some maps you just can‚Äôt Bushcamp with a scorpion, Both the German and American Skorpion.
---
If PC, I can craft you one full modded.
---
How did you ‚Äòlose‚Äô it anyway?
---
All the more reason why siding with the raiders at the end helps the settlers more than the raiders!
---
Sadly xbox but thanks for the offer.
---
[deleted]
---
I feel most people are probably going to just be like meh guess I'll go play something else until the next big update I'm tired of grinding anyway.
---
Every time I tamed something it didnt survive a server hop I hope they fix that
---
You can't craft a legendary that OP lost.
---
Are you on xbox? I have a TSE 2 star max level minigun you could have if you are. I don't use it so it's just taking up stash space.
---
I had FO1st for one month and cancelled it.. just one month! When you cancel, all your junk stays in your Junk Box. You can use the junk and withdraw from the box, you just can't deposit anything. So scrap as much as you can for a month, then cancel and only pick up Ballistic Fiber for a month üòú it is actually pretty liberating to not worry about picking up scrap anymore!
---
Also, scrip your heaviest legendaries first from your stash of scrip fodder. Sell legendary items high price, buy lighter ones low price. You'll be rolling in caps and scrip, but not have the weight to deal with. 3-star knuckles are a lot lighter than a 3-star fat man. And seriously... Purified water isn't for hoarding, it's for selling to vendors.
---
The most important thing I had to accept was this: you can't sell everything. You have to accept that you will miss out on some opportunities to profit. You have to draw a line in the sand on what is an acceptable loss, and everything on the other side of that line you pay no attention to.
---
Ditch all .38 ammo, .44 ammo, and all missiles, mini-nukes, 40mm grenades, harpoon, railway spikes, .50 caliber balls, etc. all the heavy ammo. Nobody will ever but them. Also monitor how much gunpowder you have, cos it gets *heavy!*. Ditch all power cores under a certain level. For me, i discard any power cores under 60/100 and give away any less than 80/100 to people. They aren't rare.
---
And work towards getting your large backpack! It's a grind, but try and have fun with it! That alone is an extra 30lb carry weight over the Small Backpack. But the backpck mods are way more substantial. You are 100% able to use the Grocer's and Chemist's backpack mods, as well as the others, with the small backpack ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hfxppd/small_backpack_and_proof_you_can_use_mods_on_it/)). If i remove my Chemist's Backpack, my weight goes up by 1000lbs üòÖ
---
That was removed in wastelandrrs with the new quest implementations
---
MEAT WEEK! MEAT WEEK! -Grahm
---
You don't need any of it, it's literally all luxury.
---
I would love two, one terminal style... And one wall mounted monitor that I can hide in places!
---
No, but we've had several 1800 skins in the last couple months.
---
It's been like that since Wastelanders launched, sorry to say. Makes it very hard joining on a quest with a teammate, you have no idea where they are going or what they're looking for üßê
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
I have no idea I didn't drop it cause it was favorited didn't sell it. I have no idea
---
So would there be a way to incorporate the data of "having all of the plans" from that one character into a PC mod? Say simulating a trading window with that character to see if we know them or not?
---
But he could manage it for a while. I never said I could craft a legendary lol
---
How did he become like that?
---
Haven't heard of this.
---
CHOPPIN THAT MEAT!
---
Yes! This guy gets it. It‚Äôs free stuff!  Bethesda gets to choose what free stuff they give away, or they can choose to stop entirely.  It‚Äôs non game breaking cosmetics, JFC people.
---
Enjoy your updoot
---
Well I rolled a bloodied explosive fixer after months of trying that‚Äôs why I made the post. I love the lever action though. I was using that up until now.
---
Exactly there rewards for doing content there not actually content
---
when they arrive my lifes goal will be to exterminate every single BOS that the game does not protect..
---
I mean I'm 1700 hours in, mainly playing the same character, and I'm still finding new locations and trying to connect all the story dots. 
---
Friends, creating my own stories in this environment, and intentionally dumbing down my abilities from the meta have kept things fresh, but I read you loud and clear, what works for some of us wont work for all of us. 
---
I just wish that most gamers could find the peace I've found in this game, it sure would save them some $$ jumping from FOTM game to  FOTM game.
---
Xbox the gun was level 50 mutants explosive + one perception
---
Yeah, even though she left a long time ago after calling me an asshole. Maybe killing commie mom was a mistake, but, ya know, nothing gets in the way of democracy.
---
Id still use it on my suits that sit in my stash never to be used because I‚Äôm a stealth commando
---
Lol pot meet kettle
---
&gt;!Mandatory ducting throughout the camp required.!&lt;
---
Where are you getting info on the ammo conversion rates? I‚Äôd like to read up on it.
---
Wasn't sure if you just missed it in the post's title.  Cheers!
---
That's the point though, people want luxury and companies know this. They're more likely to buy luxury they want especially when pressured by systems like this than they are pay to win items that are publicly known as predatory and bad. So more and more companies are using this model to sneakily peer pressure and time pressure you into buying more stuff.
---
Same here always looking for work as a hired goon same name as this account.
---
There's one almost always to the east of the Abandoned Bog Town, alternatively fast travel to Pylon V13 and due west there should be the same behemoth there.
---
It was intentional? Because that sure does blow.
---
dang so theres no way to know now?
---
I'm confused how do you put a gun "in your backpack"?
---
Immersion in a gameplay context doesn't mean absolute reality or absolute control. If that were the case no game ever made would meet the definition. I'd say gameplay immersion is more about the game providing you with a gameplay loop that feels satisfying and isn't broken or interfered with by meta aspects of design, ensuring you can maintain suspension of disbelief within the world context. I got that from the other modern Fallouts, even if I couldn't enter every building. And I get it with most other online games I've played (at least the good ones). 
---
But I no longer get that from 76 because there's nothing new for me to scavenge or kill for, and it's all about generic objectives on a daily rotation to jump spots on an effectively timegated and disconnected gameboard for rewards (where are these items even coming from?)... or, alternately, going to a cash shop. 
---
That said, you're still free to disagree.
---
Fortunately I haven't ran out of settlers to pay for page and ward's sins yet.
---
Same, enclave 4 life bitches!!! Lol
---
On XB1 sorta similar. Had a bloodied minigun on display on the heavy gun rack, removed and put back in stash for more budget. Budget is at 98% btw. And today logged in, 10mins into playing someone bought my bloodied minigun for 14caps or 20 minus the tax, logged out asap. Kinda hurts but not my main gun thankfully.
---
Always happens to me in SBQ fight.
---
Sometimes fast travelling helps.
---
Looks like it is associated with unyielding/bolstering gear.
---
Naahhh, this sub is full of whiners. There‚Äôs like 5 or 6 recent posts whining about seasons already, ‚Äúyada yada seasons underwhelming.... ammo converter rates are stupid.... ‚Äú
---
The thing is. Seasons is FREE. The ammo converter is much better than just dropping every .38, 10mm or .44 you pick up. 
---
But yeah it‚Äôs just normal for the people on this sub to whine about everything.
---
I‚Äôm going to need a bigger scroll wheel
---
Like what?
---
Ur welcome :D
---
50-100 of most junk materials that isnt exceedingly rare or something youre constantly crafting with.. there are a lot of items I keep between 25-50 because I almost never use them
---
go through and make sure no junk slipped into your stash without being broken down.. it happens
---
check your misc tab for unsmelted ores and gunpowder.. that stuff really adds up after a while if youre not crafting ammo or smelting the ores down
---
also.. if youre hoarding legendary gear trying to get max top dollar for every mediocre legendary item that drops youre not doing yourself any favors weight wise...
---
GL
---
-ETA: if you have a lot of gear and are determined to keep it you can craft the lightest mods for it to lower the weight in some cases
---
And fortunately they listened the infi complains during the early days, and they added (with months of delay) the needed "known/not note" feature.
---
They created an exciting and sophisticated craft system, with four digits of plans/recipes/mods... not offering us any tool to track them, to collect them. Crazy.
---
This company urgently needs a FO76 general manager with some COMMON SENSE to put some order there.
---
Yeah a lot of the skins Ill never use. I dont wear power armor often enough to care about those. Id say probably 75-80% of it is worthless to me. However there are some things in it I will use and am looking forward to. Most of the aspects to earning SCORE I already incorporate in my daily routine so for me it will be business as usual and hopefully Ill progress through it without any more effort than Im already spending so it will be fairly passive. The thing I hope they give us the means to keep check on is what reward is coming next so when it comes to limited currencies like caps and scrip etc I will have enough of a heads up to make sure I wont miss out by going over limit
---
Probably because people have thousands of rounds sitting on alts. I have 50k+ each of. 38, .44, 10mm, shotgun, and a few other ballistics. I can convert it all to something I will use now.
---
No seasons thing is free. I‚Äôm just saying this helps sell fallout 1st subs since you get monthly atoms and they‚Äôre reducing the amount of free atoms you can earn.
---
Hell yeah! Thanks for the info.
---
Besides PTS experience, juiceheads (iirc?) video has the rates.
---
Edit [ammo converter info](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K96B4c659Hc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=343)
---
Lemme know if that works or not, on mobile so idk if it did it right.
---
Does it pick one at random or does the order you place them in make a difference?
---
Hack? it's not dangerous if you have a mildly thought out build, or spent any amount of time looking for a high tier gun. If you're not a bloodybuild, not dying to SBQ is really fucking easy.
---
conjecture. They works, he can spend his money how he wants.
---
It might be a side effect of not progressing in quests in a group so a friends dialogue and queat options do not affect yours.
---
You can convert like.... 1500 10mm a day until you cap on the conversion points that are 2k a day.
---
Wasn‚Äôt Elon musks kid born like a month ago?

Nope. They must know about it so hopefully it'll get fixed sometime. Or not. ü§ì

A part of the house
---
What
---
Two guys running around, one telling you his buddy DarthDavid is leaving the game and giving stuff away. Trap camp, I figured as much since the one guy kept showing up at events. I got trap doored to a room full of radiation emitters and a door with a number lock. Me, wearing excavator and taking a rad-x just kind of stood there and pulled out my suppressor napalm flamer, finally he came in but wouldn't engage, let me out and then killed me while my back was turned. Probably because I called him a dick.

Specifically Creating (an) Original Complete Engine
---
You are so focused on the atomic shop and ignoring the positives like the ammo converter, and other non-atoms rewards completely. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the seasons but there are some positives with the rewards. 
---
Also how did you calculate the amount of atoms you can earn? It‚Äôs almost double what I calculated.
---
This is awesome. Let me know when its complete for Xbox!
---
I dont get ur question sry
---

---
I'm confused ü§îü§î Do you mean 'Stash Box'?
---
Sometimes you among the first on a server but usually it fills in short time
---
Well, I don‚Äôt think I need a hired goon, but if you want to be on a team, that works!
---
Nuts. Oh well. üëçüèª
---
"What can I say? What do you want me to say? It is what it is."
---
I don't want you to say anything in particular. You can counterpoint my position and I'll respond as best I can, or you can enjoy what you enjoy and not pay attention to criticisms. I'm not really here for encouragement I'm just sharing my thoughts with the community and Bethesda, because I want the game to be better and I don't think what I want to see is a very hard or unreasonable thing, given how normal it is for online games to put new rewards into the base game. 
---
"What assortment of Camp bling... would make the game feel more worthwhile?"
---
Anything but *almost nothing at all* after a year and a half, haha. They're never going to please everyone but what they have added is an embarassment. Have you seen the assets modders have mined from FO4? Bethesda is not short on this stuff, and it's not like new cosmetics are complex things.
---
You've been to my camp then.
---
awesome thanks
---
I love your suggestion about the under 100 thing. I think that will definitely help!  Thanks so much!
---
Don‚Äôt care, never did the atom challenges before. Love the new system.
---
I hate them all I want to shoot them all in the face to death..
---
It wont take long to add to my routine of scrib, treasury note turn in, and vendoring. I still have 30+ days of scrib  turn ins. I can simply convert ammo when I stop at my camp for the day
---
Oh, I'd love to see what you have. IGN Wrayk
---
A grind in a mmo? :O
---
Not enough information.  How many stars and what is each?  TS is a prefix while E is a major.
---
Oof I feel attacked about the purified water /s. It's like you peeked into my stash and saw my 60 purified waters. Thanks so much for your suggestions!
---
Steel for at least 5 casings too.
---
Level 50 is a high you as go in terms of special points so you‚Äôre ready assuming you‚Äôve got a got a decent gun and build
---
Did you accidentally scrip it maybe? I‚Äôve lost items transferring from stash to my inventory before, possibly that as well
---
Love my auto I1090 handmade.  With my load out, crouched and scoped i make quick work of most enemies.  Most just needs a single tap.
---
I also have an IE version but the explosive damage to targets around your primary focus negates the instigating effect on them.  I tested these two multiple times at AwOL and the i1090 is better in mobs.
---
If you don‚Äôt log into the game at all in 3 months (and therefore don‚Äôt earn any levels without having to pay for them all) I don‚Äôt know why anyone would buy the seasons lol. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense logically.
---
getting items they decide to give me is not better than getting atoms to buy whatever I want
---
Whitesprings has vendors for all factions inside now.
---
It won‚Äôt have the inventory of Grahm or the travelling Charleston vendor but it does for everything else
---
How do you place items in the backpack? Or do you mean it was in your inventory when you died?
---
I'm pretty good about scrapping/selling/scrip-ing(?) Armor and weapons but I feel like mayyyyyybe I'm hoarding junk. I'll go through my stash and downsize. Thanks so much!!
---
ETA: I think my problem may be worse than I thought. I have 692 glass shards just chilling.  Send help.
---
Edit 2: and 398 fertilizer. I need an intervention team.
---
Throw it in your vending machine
---
Hmm fuck, you're right. But my intentions were good anyways. Cheers to you pal!
---
I'd assume the 'Reputation' for the Brotherhood of Steel quests this Fall/Winter will be 'ranking up' the hierarchy  (Either as a Scribe or Knight) i can definitely see that working plus since it'll be at a slow-ish paste it would make those of us who Roleplay actually think on how to do things. 
---
Think about it: There could VERY well be a misc/daily quest to turn in pre-War books like in Fallout 3, or collect Brotherhood Holotags (Although the second one would likely be a repeatable misc quest)
---
The possibilities are definitely out there.
---
I kinda just chose perks not thinking in the long run so I have a really random build
---
Preaching to the choir internet amigo.
---
Has there been anything better in the shop the past 3 months than the ammo converter?
---
Again I want to emphasize I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the seasons and think it‚Äôs the wrong direction, but doesn‚Äôt it come down to what the rewards are and personal taste?

---
I'd like to know what's in those posh bungalows too ! It's only fair I wipe out the ghouls in that place every damn day...
---
What do you need the atoms for anyways? All anyone ever does on Tuesday is complain about how trash the items are
---
Sweet home alabama
---
Honestly maybe
---
Use weapon/ armor skins.. no matter how goofy they might look. That'll prevent your valuable stuff from showing up in the scrip/ sale menus. But then if you ever accidentally drop it it will be destroyed... so also  rename it so that all your valuable gear shoes up at the top of your list instead of being spread out throughout the list.  There REALLLY should be a lock/ unlock feature for items you're carrying!
---
After they fix the bug with it
---
Vend it. If it doesnt sell after a reasonable time scrip it
---
You said you are going specifically for the secret service cosmetic. 
---
This is exactly the major problem with this.
---
In order to get the perceived value you'd have to regularly use each type of armor, power armor, use multiple builds for each weapon type and be a person who enjoys camp building.
---
Hardly anyone will use all of this content. Once you hit secret service armor you won't be switching it off for much else. But even then, let's look at these as full sets. 
---
You only really unlock four apparel styles throughout the entire season. That being: ghillie, nuclear onslaught, captain cosmos pa, captain cosmos outfit. So what about their value. Well, technically there are Power armors for 800-1000 so maybe that sounds good. But you can get sets including all main power armour's for ~1400 or so. 
---
However, as part of Bethesda's ploy to get people to spend more they all come in on arbitrary "deals" that actually make them cheaper usually. Likewise there are often bundles that include paints for every armor and a couple weapon skins. (See vault tec/patriot bundles) for 1500 atoms
---
Now, once you are a high level you cab get all 5 dailies in under half an hour and/or while doing other quests. That comes out to about 520 atoms a week. Meaning I could get a full armor paint job, two weapon paints, a pip-boy paint, an outfit, and a full suit of power armor paints for &lt;2900 atoms. That is &lt;6weeks at roughly three hours.
---
Next, let's look at this system. According to Bethesda it should take roughly one hour for low levels and 1-2 for higher levels. So let's be conservative and say one hour per level. The deals/bundles I mentioned cap out at secret service and x01 armors respectively. So let's only go to x01 armor in the season system.
---
That's rank 58. Meaning it will take (on a very generous conservative side) 58 hours to get roughly the same stuff. That is a factor of over 19x the length to get the same stuff.
---
Unlike with the atom store however, you can only get one type of cosmetic. You can't choose the patriot bundle instead of the vault tec bundle, for instance.
---
Now let's go to *your* specific case. A hot new ghillie secret service set is available.
---
Hypothetical atom store: The most expensive armor skin I can find on its own (not part of a bundle) is 900 atoms. But just to be nice let's say you have to buy a full bundle for 1500 to use it. That is roughly three weeks at 1.5 hours if you are trying.
---
NOT HYPOTHETICAL S.E.A.S.O.N method. Rank 82. On the conservative side that's 82 hours. 54.667x as long ad buying a whole bundle. Sure, you'll get some other gear. Most of which you will never touch because of your build and your level.
---
But fuck it, I'm still here. Let's address currency. You only get one set of bullion/scrip every 20 ranks. 20. Ranks. 
---
Being nice, the highest amount of bullion you get is half the daily cap. Scrip is slightly less than two days worth. So at an hour per rank even in the last 20 ranks. Is 20 hours for 100 bullion and 250 scrip.
---
 In order to be comparable for dailies. You'd  have to spend 40 hours for gold/10 hours for scrip.
---
So the currency is hardly affected and daily log in is still highly incentivized
---
You are able to craft ammo, but for now, don't be afraid to use your melee weapons and scavenge what you can.
---
 Also, most player vendors will have ammo for sale, I would recommend only buying ammo for 1 cap a piece.
---
Thank you but the damage is already done
---
Kill scorch people, they always have some.  That will help until you can get to a train station or a player vendor. Also, later on you can craft your own.
---
I take offense to #4. I agree chainsaws should have legendaries (and be readily available over level 20), I am lvl 104 and use a lvl 20 flaming chainsaw with a long bow bar, and there is a reason I call it a can opener. I‚Äôve seen it violently rip through X-01 in a matter of seconds! It‚Äôs effective if you have the right perks and mods! But I do agree: we do need legendary chainsaws! That would be amazing!
---
If you're making one for ps4, I'll contribute a lot of plans for ya. The more rare ones, such as the plasma grenade will cost something though
---
Carnivore makes that a non issue along with two industrial water purifiers at your camp.
---
...I wonder what the exchange rate will be...and also, I dumped a bunch in a train station suit case today lol
---
I don't know what a 'dog element' is, and I know that this game is a c/p of FO4... what does that have to do with anything? xD
---
Here are five free to play games (not even a box price like 76) that have no sub model required, consistent players indicating a satisfying gameplay loop on some level, and are still being updated: Path of Exile, DOTA2, Warframe, Destiny 2, and Eve Online. 
---
You might not like these games but they are easy examples to disprove your weird argument that there are no games without a sub that have repeatable content.
---
Also I believe to the right of the vault is a dead settler or responder and they have ammo on them.
---
.38 ammo is usually pretty easy to find in containers or looted off of enemies. Take your time exploring the forest region outside of Vault 76, Flatwoods etc. You shouldnt have too much trouble finding ammo and weapons. The region is set up pretty well to provide for new players
---
False.  Sometimes as a solo I have gotten larger waves like it was on release.
---
Materials for ammo and items you need to repair are essential.
---
Most mats are easily farmable.  It is boring, but that's fallout.  There are posts and guides that tell you where to go and server-hop, especially if its an enemy that you are farming, e.g., farming acid by killing crickets at Tanagra.
---
Once you know what you need and where to go it is just a matter of spending an hour or so to server-hop those mats.  Again...boring but it sure saves space in the stash.
---
I will add...what u/plaguewiind stated.   Gettting FO1st for one month and just farm/scrap everything is worth the $9.99 price.  You can fill up with a butt-load of scrap and use it when you need it.  Running low?  Then do another month of FO1st.
---
&gt; doesn‚Äôt it come down to what the rewards are and personal taste?
---
which is why a statement like..
---
&gt; Has there been anything better in the shop the past 3 months than the ammo converter?
---
has no teeth.. its all relative
---
Id rather it be my choice is all Im saying..
---
that said.. to this day the only thing Ive taken from the atom shop that wasnt a freebie is the Bye Now emote...
---
What is the forbidden sub?
---
The content is all the things in the game not just the activities, but also the rewards for them, the framework upon which you express yourself while playing the game.
---
Power just shows it on the map. They still work with bo juice
---
Must downvote.....but can't. Too polite  :)
---
Is it out??
---
The t r a d I n g sub apparently the mods from that sub and our sub don‚Äôt like Evan their or something like that so we just call it the forbidden sub as to not get our post removed
---
No heavy ammo (unless you‚Äôre a heavy build).
---
No more than 20 purified water on you at a time and sell any extra to robot vendors...don‚Äôt put it in your stash.
---
Don‚Äôt hang on to extra heavy weapons unless they are weightless (90% reduced weight) to sell...or god rolls.
---
Use your gunpowder and create it when needed.
---
10 stimpaks, 10 radx, and 10 radaway, no more.
---
FO1st scrap box (lol)
---
Anti armor Gatling laser
---
Its always been this way. Theres a common misconception that removing power "turns off" the machines. All powering them does is puts a marker on the map so other players can find you. Subsequently removing the power to them just takes away that map marker. The only way to stop people accessing them is to store or scrap them or put them behind a walled in room
---
Same with the Raider Punk, he could talk about the "network", tongue twisters and conspiracy theory garbage all day and I don't get tired of it.
---
Yeah but i do that anyways. If i find something i can use i will take it
---
Removing dailies and weeklies and rolling them into the season pass.
---
The other categories remain.
---
Ah okay then, me and my buddies just found this then
---
Oh! Uh... i didn't get it at first but now... yeahhh... I still have a screenshot on Xbox of the Scorchbeast Queen doing a *clears throat* *pose* after myself and 15 other mid/high levels killed her. I honestly thought it was hilarious how it abruptly happened like that.
---
Many oddites when it comes to this game. Definitely makes it more unique regardless.
---
Bo Juice!
---
June 30th
---
The best juice ever!
---
Sounds like you may have dropped it without realizing it
---
So? Its still free ammo
---
I am one of the people who do the dailies and weeklies regularly. 
---
I've always been sort of working class proud that I have camp items but the only money I ever spent was the $10 for the game itself.
---
I really don't want much of this stuff. I'm interested in the ammo converter of course, and glad that it is a low level, but I figure the exchange rate will factor in that it was easy to get. Nothing else on that list really interests me, I like the jangles beer stein. I will have to decide if that is worth grinding it to 100. I guess it depends on the challenges.
---
One of the things I hate about this new DLC trend is that they're timed.
---
If you take a break and come back, you'll miss out on content.
---
What system? I can give you a hand if you‚Äôre on PS4.
---
That‚Äôs it boys, we don‚Äôt have to look no further, the most pointless comment ever made is here, call off the search.
---
Back in my day we didn't MUTATE willy-nilly!
---
yup. just alcohol addiction. thank god we dont have to drink the special blend to negate the addiction lol. Many people have addictol but early in the game, I got addicted to alcohol so much almost never found addictol, (and never to chems for some reason) i got the perk to never get addicted. but then I kept gobbling up all the alcohol all the time wherever... idk if that is the real addiction.
---
Lol so why are you so pro atomic shop?
---
Where do you place the camp ? My camp is currently at the cliff overlooking that pylon so just wanted to know for a possible future move
---
lol go through and cut everything that isnt super rare down to at least 100.. then you can go up or down from there according to your usage..
---
also tag the most important things to you for search and for a little while pick up ONLY those things.. then you can see exactly what other materials youre getting along with them and act acordingly
---
one thing I would keep all of is ballistic fiber.. it sucks not being able to repair your armor for lack of 2 pieces.. lol
---
Wait you can only get the ammo converter from the first season ? Wouldn't that hurt new players or old players that come after the season. Like when they bring back the BOS, and hopefully some fun story elements.
---
I know I deserve it for trying to hide my flaws. 
---
You unlocked the truth by higher Perception.
---
Their estimation for the atoms you can earn in the current system isn't far off from what I'd estimate. 50 atoms every day of the week + 150 atoms from weeklys comes out to 500 a week, or 6k in 3 months. You can sometimes earn a bit more a day or a bit less a week but I'd say that's pretty average. 
---
500 atoms a month is a huge hit to potential free atoms. By my estimations that's a cut down to 25%. And it doesn't seem likes it's going to be a trade off where the players that currently earn the most atoms will earn less but the players that earn the least will earn more. It'll likely be a case where you'll have to spend just as much if not more effort for the same amount of currency.
---
I don't mind them offering fewer atoms overall, but this is just way too much of a change. Especially considering the low quality of items in the Atom Shop, it's almost insulting that they're pushing to monetize the system even harder.
---
The nuka cola vending machine is for strictly nuka cola, the punch bowl on the other hand is for nuka shine only
---
Kill enemies. Take ammo off their bodies. Repair that machete at a workbench. Don‚Äôt know why you are walking around with a broken machete lol
---
Why waste 1500 atoms on first ten....u can only buy into it after 2 weeks....save it for last 10
---
&gt; to this day the only thing Ive taken from the atom shop that wasnt a freebie is the Bye Now emote...
---
Im pro free atoms and choice on how to spend them.. even if I do not actually spend them
---
other than purchase price I havent dropped one thin dime on this game
---
Tuesday June 30th!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Sure, that ammo converter is cool and it will be useful, that's why I said that we will get at least some new items but that kind of new item with a new mechanic won't be something usual to get.
---
Also, it has a new currency system that is not like what we could imagine or expect after the Armco machine implementation, and it seems like it has another daily limit too (you can check all the info posted by another user [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfo2ju/ammo_converter_finally_i_bloody_love_you_bethesda/), but it looks like another step back)
---
I'm not against this new system or any new stuff, but it should at least offer us the same or more quality and not less.
---
&gt;Also how did you calculate the amount of atoms you can earn? It‚Äôs almost double what I calculated.
---
If you mean the amount of atoms that you can earn now, I did a quick estimate with this week's quantity and  yesterday's daily rewards.
---
There is some cool stuff in there. Bummed
---
There is zero chance I‚Äôll be able to make it all the way to 100. No time to play these days with wife and kids always around.
---
I‚Äôm on pc unfortunately but thanks for the offer
---
You can build without a foundation! Alas it is glitchy and any floor or staircase you place with this method can only be removed by moving your camp!
---
Not sure the validity of this but it seems like really popular items come back very frequently while others can be gone for 6+ months
---
Why the hate for the BOS, in 76 they were so noble,  plus they have that die hard, old grizzled bastard feel.
---
Shit man, get them playing!
---
The other attributes on these two guns don‚Äôt affect damage so I didn‚Äôt include them.
---
Are you xbox or pc? I could give you loads for free if on Xbox:)
---
Every few weeks to every few months, sometimes longer.
---
I think most things that arent newly recent have come back either as a single item or part of a bundle..
---
not 100% on that but it seems that way to my observation
---
sadly im on PC.
---
So you would rather atoms you will never spend than cool rewards? Ok. 
---
Do you think the ammo converter is something you want?
---
You can buy your way through at the end! After two weeks of it being out.
---
150 hours, level 80, I've only seen one and it was at the abandoned bog town.
---
They both scrip
---
Spoiler -but yeah vault 79 your freind also cant turn off the turrents for you. Which means helping them is near impossible without destroying the tanky bastards.
---
I think I consistently did 4/5 dailies and most weeklies when I was playing regularly.  Most of them only took a few seconds to do, so why not.
---
You earn less atoms but arguable will have more cosmetics at the end of 3 months than if you spend those atoms in the shop. Isn‚Äôt that what matters at the end of he day? How much cool stuff you get?
---
my base is a tinkers workbench next to the overseers camp..
---
ill use your ammo machine.. I mean its lvl 5 right? Im sure ill unlock it.. but Ill never build it..
---
of all the rewards I am most stoked for perk card packs so I can spend them on legendary perks..
---
I like radiums but I had to give a lot away this week. I still use my bloody ones from time to time
---
you would need to get it off another player, or wait for mischief night to return (Halloween event)
---
üòÇ
---
Oooooh
---
Was part of the halloween bundle last year.  Not sure if it was also a separate plan dropped during the event.
---
You‚Äôd have to team with someone that has it, then they could build it at your camp.
---
Well ive been convinced to move to a bloody power armor guy
---
I see
---
Well looks like a good way to recycle the absolute junk ammo you get,looks like you can feed it grenades too which is nice.
---
I'm a bit confused. What does the count mean? Take mini nukes for example. Is it 3 nukes for 100 points? Or is it buy 3 nukes for 400? Or is it both? 
---
Also what does max sale/max buy mean? I can sell 60 mini nukes before hitting some sort of cap or what?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Grim_Reaper_Vault-Boy_cutout
---
its not limited to BOS.. I hate every living being on the map that isnt an actual human being playing the game also.. lol
---
actually I hate some of them too.. but not as much as NPCs... too many of them are protected
---
Yea... no thanks. I‚Äôm ok missing out. I don‚Äôt want it that bad.
---
You can team up with any rando on your server and do any event to get the challenge completed. They don't even have to be around you if you don't want them to.
---
People do that without rugs, no excuse personally I used them to stop people from fast travelling under the game world!
---
Guess I‚Äôm waiting till halloween
---
Oooohhh okay, not bad then. Not necessarily great, they could have used that effort to fix broken parts of the game but cant win every battle I guess.
---
also.. BOS are a little too Stepford for me even in other games..
---
Ok, so I guess I need to wait and see
---
Vend and or scrip.  As much as I want to like them they are underwhelming.
---
Ok. I'll just keep checking
---
Ah a genocidal menace, I love it ! Then good luck wiping Appalachia of it's people.
---
Just do a bloodied junkies/build.  The gear is everywhere and you can pick it up really cheap.
---
The two synergize with each other.
---
Best you can do is check the atom shop update every Tuesday
---
Ok. Maybe they'll have some things in with the seasons update.
---
Did that accidentally so many times in the early days, and then the scaffolding mess I built to get them down again!
---
Will trade you the plan for a be Gat plas :)
---
Thanks for doing this.
---
If/when an XB1 version gets going, please contact me (GT: NrdNParadise). I have most of the plans (with lots of extras) and would be happy to contribute and assist in putting this together. Just don't have the extra time to organize it myself. Cheers.
---
Ok. I didn't know it updated on Tuesdays. I was looking daily. Ha
---
I wish we could do the ESO route id just pay dlc and be done with it and at leasy get 30 plus hours of quests with stuff with new endgame activities everytime they do em. Then 1 20 hour dlc at the end of the year :v
---
Doing stuff the community wants isnt very bethsda
---
I would suggest setting up camp between the Gorge Junkyard and the Morgantown Trainyard.  From that area, you can melee across to Morgantown Airport and then do Collision Course. 
---
Also, watch your perk cards and keep an eye out for Scrounger under Luck.  It'll help some. 
---
If you're on xbox, I always have a few spare rounds.
---
U serious are u joking? I hope your joking ?
---
Do we have anyone set up to do ps4? I have a mule with around 2000+ plans that im willing to donate to start up.
---
I imagine they'll recycle stuff on there similar to how the do the atom shop
---
Try opening the brewing station once or twice
---
Let me know I got a mule with over 2k of plans but thats counting duplicates

It gets worse when you realise it will take you 149.5 hours (6dys5hrs30mins) to complete according to Bethesda's estimate and according to data mining if you miss even a single challenge then you can't reach level 100 without spending atoms. Even if that part isn't true you will still have a cap on how much you can level up per day which is nonsense and means you will definitely have to play challenges every single day for 77 days straight to have a chance at level 100.
---
Since it is a plan and not an Atom Shop item  you could try posting to see if someone can build one for you.  That's limited, but at least you can have one in your CAMP
---
It's just Bethesda error. Never mind it
---
anything that a lot of people bought in the past is sure to come back because they know its a winner..
---
I think the problem is when they add it in a bundle with stuff you may have already purchased as a single item?
---
Of course I'm joking smh
---
I couldn't pull up any other menus. I wear PA so no legendary armor on.
---
Oof that stings, hopefully they get these vendor bugs under control soon... I think this one is new so more people reporting might help get it on their radar.
---
its till mid september so 10 ish weeks to grind 100-200 hours of the new challenges
---
No i meant all the poison mobs that the sbq spawns when she lands that kill a power armor user within seconds (at least if youre bloodied).
---
Im talking stingwings, snallygasters, mirelurks or bloodbugs.
---
That makes sense. And that's too bad there isn't a way to reduce the atom price and not get a double of something you already have.
---
Dude that‚Äôs way too much effort to be worth it when I can get way more than that from the raider ammo machine
---
I will try that one I just wanted  to make one anyway
---
Hit the market sub!  Lots of really friendly people there and I‚Äôm sure someone will have a suitable replacement, if it‚Äôs any comfort, I would value that rifle around 7-9 k so it‚Äôs not irreplaceable.  It‚Äôs a great gun, not downplaying it, just letting you know your options.  Sorry for your lost weapon!
---
Pattle Bass
---
Some Cool Or Recycled Equiptment
---
That would be awesome, good thinking!
---
The main reason I got the Fascacht collection makes this the most trivial challenge now!
---
The real problem it's that it's lazy. 
---
Rather than put the real work in to make proper endgame content in, it's just more grind. 
---
It's a distraction from the reality threat there's nothing to do at high level. More and more grind, less and less content.
---
The display case that doesnt have the wooden backing has clean glass.
---
Aw, man. I like doing those challenges.
---
Yup
---
But could that really destroy his entire camp? Guess it would take forever with that unstated item
---
NOOOOOOOOIOIIOOOOOOOOOO YO MINOY HOY. 
---
That was the motivation :(
---
I'm not as veteran as many other players are, so I haven't bought that many items yet, also I don't use a meta non PA build so many PA skins appeals me but in any case, this was posted trying to use a neutral perspective and let's be honest,  it's better to get more atoms and use them in whatever you want than just grind and wait 3 months just to get less atoms and random stuff that you may not want or use.
---
thats why you never sleep on something you think you might want.. youll probably end up saving money in the end
---
Not always, that takes some server hopping!
---
It's only useful in NW! XD
---
That's good to know!
---
I'm juuuust starting to get to the point where I'm really needing ballistic fiber now. I'm surprised the bots at Camp McClintock haven't learned my name yet
---
Seriously? Lame
---
Mini nukes aren‚Äôt life changing or anything, but I really enjoy firing my two-shot fat man into a crowd, or at a sheepsquatch. It takes away a good chunk of health!
---
Literally just did it at level 24 now. So, yeah. Any level.
---
I always have to exit vats then re enter for my shots to register, even if it said 95% hit chance prior.
---
I‚Äôll friend up tomorrow.  Can‚Äôt wait to see where I am at.  It‚Äôs so rare I find something I don‚Äôt already know so this might be eye opener.
---
IGN TxJeepers
---
It worked, thanks.
---
I like modding them as a favour.
---
once I got several thousand caps.. and a good routine for earning daily caps limit.. I just went and bought a ton of it from vendors.. that along with what I pick up just playing the game now.. it hasnt been a problem since..
---
I can repair everything 200% now too so it doesnt come up as often as it used to and BF is one of the few things I still pick up religiously
---
I play destiny and warframe atlas prime forever and am a titan main, these to are defiantly like this and it took them in destinies case the taken king and warframe took until like 2018 before its playerbase exploded. Destiny has only became free as of forsaken. Also ment dog helmet.

---
gotcha, thanks
---
I will donate what plans I have to the Xbox One mule!
---
Currently bundling this with trying to get the responders vendor to spawn at the train station.  As I server hop, if it's close to 9 pm I head on over to the camp.
---
I'm hoping i can level up enough from playing normally and doing events. Looking up specific challenges to complete doesn't interest me.
---
I experienced this exact same thing this week. I was helping a lower level build a camp and i would get disconnected and nothing would save and I was out all the materials. I would try again and get disconnected and nothing would save and out the materials.  I would up buying him the plan and then giving him the mats so he could build it.
---
I'm in the same boat as you as far having a family and I run a business and I just game when I have time. I'm grateful that there is an option and choice.
---
Of course, more is better in this case. I was primarily making a joke at the expense of the people on here who seem to only have the energy to complaim.about everything in the game. Complain that it is all trash. Complain that they will have less FREE currency to spend on said trash.
---
This is exciting to see but I'll be honest. The perk card packs seems kind of pointless for anyone who has their build locked in.
---
Right now anyways.
---
And bigger budgets and access to full atomic shop inventory for us to purchase when ever from the build menu.  That works now but only includes what‚Äôs currently in shop.
---
Does Beth not care how many atoms they not selling cause we can‚Äôt get things like the display cases from last winter!
---
it's still better to sell unwanted ammo for 1c and buy wanted ammo for 10c then using the converter sadly.
---
When I first went into that area and seen all the skeletons in the building and the scene I thought "well at least they went out having fun". 
---
Then I got to the pledges and was all "oh......"
---
I personally run herbivore and grow veggies. Completely self sufficient and easily restocked. Carnivore was what I wanted originally, but I was getting mutations "naturally" at the time haha
---
It's to get you to buy it. It's actually a real thing used by a lot of companies, I'm sure there is a term for it.
---
They tell you it's only available for a limited time, so you think you have to buy it now or it'll be gone forever.
---
The point has already been made by others but the issue is that the current system where we are able to more easily choose what "cool stuff" we get is being replaced by a system where the majority of the stuff we are getting is preseleced for us and now we are being pushed towards spending more real money on Atoms for the things we might actually want.
---
Even if we get more stuff does it matter if you aren't ever going to use 95% of it? I'd rather be able to select 5 items of my choosing than be given 10 items someone else picked for me.
---
 
---
Yeah, personally I find some of the stuff is really cool, but the majority of it could go in the trash for all I care. At least 75% of the cosmetics are things I would literally never purchase. If you like the majority of items that's great. But I get the feeling you'd be in the minority.
---
I have 1 perk point in stealth and sit in front of the SBQ pumping clips into her face without being detected.
---
SPECIAL plays the most important role.
---
Woah woah woah how do I learn how to repair objects to 200%??
---
Such a great asset to the community, truly a great job!  Well done.
---
what did you expected? 
---
atoms = real money for bethesda. the whole system is made to excuse the obtainable atom nerf.
---
They‚Äôre still going to be there, but they‚Äôll count towards your SCORE rank rather than just giving you Atoms. They‚Äôre also supposedly going to be less ridiculous.
---
I like to mix it up with other drinks. Like russian roulet but with terminal brain damage and hardcore alcoholism
---
I personally love my instigating lever action.
---
If I were to get one, I‚Äôd get a lever action.
---
Yes. And I'm continuing to update it. The release of WL caused some changes to be made in [map76.com](https://map76.com) which we link to a lot for locations and that caused all the thinks to break. So I'm slowly working my way through and fixing them.
---
For instigating getting a gauss rifle would be best for its high damage. Instigating and explosive is very situational. While yes you do have that extra damage from explosive you also risk hitting another enemy with said explosive ruining the instigating effect. A instigating hunting rifle would be a great alternative until you can get a gauss.
---
100 is WAY too much for most junk.  You don't even need 1 if you never use it.  20 "just in case" is more than enough. 
---
The stuff you actually use, keep more but really wtf you need 100 asbestos or bone or whatever for?
---
Ahh.
---
My camp has mutts that spawn behind it so I have a constant source of meat.
---
Plus my tent is down near the drop site so I can easily grab some scotch beast meat
---
No, all workshop events have a dedicated reward pool. Take a look at the help tab. There's a section on all the events.
---
Ehhh, I doubt it. There are thousands of checkboxes. We aren't making a 'new version' of this but are continuing to update it as the game is updated.
---
they aren't. having played rdr 2 and destiny, i was surprised people around here actually got excited for a battle pass.
---
oh okay i like BoS but they aren't noble here, they hit protectors for supplies and was planing to hit the free states supply too but raglhejs put defenses and Barrie's up to hinder them, yet the place is full of roles and  fight marks.
---
Yeah, and all the links broke when [map76.com](https://map76.com) was updated for WL so I'm slowly working my way through and fixing them. Thanks for the tip!
---
woah, one more reason to not play the game any further.
---
it isn't that much we have right now as endgame content, they take care we won't play the game at least once for 5min's to obtain 50-70 atoms daylie.
---
You know, if someone has a spare rubber ducky (a device that‚Äôs normally used for pen testing that acts like a HID device) and a spare Xbox, you could probably run a script to keep it from getting knocked offline for being idle.
---
Making manual changes to your existing sheet is probably the best way. I have moved the revision history onto its own tab now to be easier to find. I try to keep it very thorough for this exact purpose. However, if your copy pre-dates the wastelanders release, I would just copy the current sheet and manually transfer over your checkmarks.
---
Yes, we've discussed it. It's a bit out of our abilities currently. It would also require a login system and the related security.
---
So if I were to get am Instigating Hunting Rifle what else would I look for? Vats Hit % and Reload? 
---
Side note: I am far from rich
---
That's good
---
My friend was watching me play, and i encountered the same guy, my friend excited told me to go look for the source of screams, when i finally caught up with the guy, i couldnt believe me eyes, we literally cried from laughter for 10 minutes, brilliant.
---
max fix it good for armor and max weapon artisan for weapons
---
-ETA: I swap them in when repairing..
---
I agree BUT if you get gold perk cards you can trade them for legendary perk cards that might fit better for your build.
---
One thing to consider is the ONLY penalty for dying is dropping your junk. If it stays there waiting for you with threat of death on everyone else, there is no penalty at all.
---
Angry Turtle video brought me here.

---
This is awesome work guys. I love that you guys did this for the community! Many thanks :)
---
Bethesda, now that the community has made up for your shortcomings (again), would you mind added this feature into the game?
---
You're already tracking what plans we know and don't know. All you need to do is setup an interface to show us. Heck, you could even use the existing vendor inventory interface much like what these guys are doing. 
---
Any coder knows that this is very trivial work. The kind of work that a coding intern could do.
---
‚ÄúBuH tHE Pvp aND TRap CaMpS BaD!‚Äù
---
True, I‚Äôd rather lose caps tbh. I just get mad I can‚Äôt get revenge. Lol
---
This just happened to me about five minutes ago. I was standing in front of the computer, three people showed up, the first two came into the house and then ran out like sensible people, the third guy comes prancing in, goes straight for the terminal, all while I'm shooting at him wildly and bashing him with my gun... Nope, 1900 caps and various fluxes be damned, he wants his sheep NOW. 8 minutes left plus I'd posted a LFG so no one even had time to join. Naturally we got our asses handed to us and I spent all my damn ammo trying to salvage the event.
---
No wonder no one does this event anymore.
---
since it's the only "content" we get for sure that is mostly working i would say kinda - all of my teammates are logging in once a day for the daylie challanges and once a week we are hyped for the ATX update... sadly it's the only thing we get frequently.
---
For a hunting rifle, I‚Äôd go with faster fire rate. Since no matter how many rounds you fire, you‚Äôre still just reloading a magazine. Faster reload would be best on a lever action.
---
Especially because 99% of my deaths are lag related.
---
Yea I used all of my Adhesive building that crap. Luckily with Super Duper and Butchers Bounty, it wasn't too hard gathering all the materials. I also have the double explosion perk and max demolition damage perk but I don't know if those get factored into the explosive bait radius. My Adhesive Farm is working overtime tonight.
---
Me too, friend
---
Right now my approach is keep 100 of everything for now. My camp is suuuuuuper like white girl basic and I'm looking to expand so until I get my camp the way I like I'll just get a feel for what I do and don't need. But you're right, I can't realistically see what in the world I'll need 100 bone for.  Lol.
---
I hate breaching, people bragging about being able to do Silos in 5 minutes etc. then you find out its just from breaching, it should be one of the easiest things for them to fix, but no. They also keep builds and guns in the game that are clearly broken/unbalanced which make any content trivial, as much as I'd like them to balance and fix things, I have very little faith in this development team now. I love Fallout 76, but I do not trust the devs at all.
---
&gt; No heavy ammo (unless you‚Äôre a heavy build).
---
guy with a similar post last week was all like.. I have these mini nukes and missiles just in case I need them.. lol
---
So you are building a griefer trap camp given that you have an issue with anti-griefers?
---
Ugh I'm so overwhelmed with how much I have to learn about this game lol
---
It's not about the loot. It's about sending a message.
---
Is this something that they were working on or something I totally missed in game already?
---
well played yo
---
Those are 3 different weapon categories and each would need its own build and armor to make it the most effective. Splitting points even between 2 primary weapon classes stretches you thin even with the damage bonuses from bloodied. I would highly recommend specializing into one of them rather than going for an all around build
---
You never know, I really like that paradox too.
---
Something they are working on for update 20
---
I coughed on that MFers crusty face. No regrets :)
---
Getting explosive is counter-productive.
---
You might be thinking added bonus good but if that explosive goes off hitting several targets near your initial one, you've just nullified your instigating effect.
---
That's not even to mention potential bugs where explosive effect goes off before the instigating one.
---
If I were you, I'd just go instigating only. If you REALLY want explosive, go with a different effect like bloodied, junkies or AA.
---
The problem is either they won't accept the team invite, respond to the message I send them, or the Xbox messages don't work at all.
---
LOL. They're giving me free stuff, but its not free stuff I get to choose, greedy bastards. /s
---
Join up. Gt:shadyrebob
---
Blame Zenimax(publisher) not Bethesda.
---
This is accurate.
---
Really wish there was a lock feature, hold for 5 or 10 seconds to lock and unlock.
---
Or, hear me out, you could not give a fuck. Suffer through more UI annoyances just to participate in a currency slog? A currency slog that has mediocre rewards at best. The only "neat" thing about the legendary system is that you'll be able to remove clutter cards.
---
youll get there
---
That same for console ?
---
I mean, I get it, currently you can earn over 2000 atoms a month which means you can generally afford a bundle or 2 from the atom shop. It IS a big drop off, but at the end of the day, Zenimax wanna make money, we're lucky we can even earn atoms at all if I'm being honest. Plenty of games out there where all the shop items must be purchased, so I'm not gonna get too pissed at zenimax for trying to monetise a game that has persistent upkeep costs and development fees.
---
Dang, that's really cool. I never would have thought of doing that!
---
Ah dang... that sucks but good to know. I feel like it should be tied to the Bethesda account but oh well. Thanks for the info üò´
---
Y‚Äôall better give this Plan Mule of yours the name of [Virgil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_A._Lewis)
---
He got it wrong in the vid about the atx being atomic shop from the looks of how they described it. Seems like it might just be an FX thing.
---
Bootlickers gonna downvote you but this is correct. Expect more and more of this going forward from all Zenimax properties.
---
&gt;Nobody is going to skip everything.
---
whales, people who work and have no problem to spend 150$ if they earn well. that's the whole point of this system, next to cap the earnable atoms to make regular players buy more. don't forget, we are only a small percentage who gather up in comunitys like reddit, most of the players are playing only a few hours a week and aren't in-deep with the whole system. this season system is not for us, it is for the 3% of whales or bloody casuals.
---
What? No people keep attacking my camp and myself  accusing  me a of being a griefer, i'm only level 34.
---
I mean unless you spent your caps and flux on the card, it's not your event to start.
---
Don't care
---
The munitions plant up north could be a good way to farm Ammo points, Just afk at that workshop and wait for .50 and just sell it lol
---
Oh shoot. Maybe I should get rid of those 20 missiles I have in case I need them. I have no freaking clue about which build I want or anything. I feel like such an idiot ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
you know there are ways to see edit history besides the comment below you not having any context?
---
Along with any player who has their own crafted ammo machine!
---
Don't do it man(or woman) get rid of it. The quest to get the mods for it is a neverending descent into darkness.
---
Yep, that's how it works. The PTS cloned your character the day it went live, and the only way to update the PTS version is in the PTS. It doesn't get updated as you progress your adventure mode character.
---
if it was my build..
---
get rid of the time of day regen perks in endurance for one thing
---
swap travel agent in as needed, dont run it all the time
---
you could probably use those points better IMO
---
I always interact with the punch bowls when they are at someone's camp. I have yet to get nukashined. I have one at my camp and did not put nukashine in it. But I am now!
---
I would love that. My luck on fixers has been terrible and I do really like the gauss pistol, but pistol builds are still a bit lackluster.
---
So based on your very helpful information I think that means I would like an Instigating Rapid (and also possibly, VATS Enhanced) Hunting Rifle. I hope the 3* version one isn't a God Tier. I'm still fairly new to this so I'm not sure what is and isn't.
---
Don't listen to anyone suggesting you spend more money on this game than you already have. FO1st is a fucking scam and supporting it is just asking for the game to stay in its current state. Why fix the broken when dummies continually pony up for it?
---
I have an IE pipe revolver rilfe that I love for sneak kills.
---
Happened to me right now in a SBQ fight... and the worst part was that I was seemingly revived by one of my armor pieces but I still got the message that "some other player has taken your loot" and new something was wrong. Furthermore, It just allowed me to respawn in Vault 76 and when I tried, it told me that I couldn't fast travel because I was overencumbered... the only solution was to quit to the main menu and I appeared right in the same place I died (without my loot, of course).
---
also.. if you could make room or add points to STR to get a max blocker in there that would be good..
---
being able to ignore 45% of incoming melee damage is huge considering how often you get melee'd in this game
---
Hear me out: Weasel as an ally, and a quest is find a new voicebox for her, that being an unused motherlode voicebox on a hidden hornwright test site/lab
---
I just purchased an instigating gauss rifle on sniper/stealth build and loving it so far. More so than TS lever action.
---
That code means you are banned. U shouldn‚Äôt have duped all that ammo sir
---
It's weird, the Fixer has all the same unlocked mods as the combat rifle, learnt by scrapping combat rifles, but previous skins for the combat rifle didn't work for the Fixer!
---
But you aren‚Äôt forced to do the challenges or get anything from the Atomic Shop
---
Is the Gauss Rifle affected by Rifleman perks? Figured it would be Energy Weapon stuff.
---
That's some excellent loading screen material you have there. 
---
I've always though it would be dope to have a shared gallery of photos when you're in a team, that way you all can see each other's photos.
---
Strangely enough, griefers and this breed of anti-griefers are the same person, could be some really strange smoke screen to avoid getting reported, so that they are literally (and less my original figurative use) the same people. Either way, it might be the locks or design of your base. People are suspicious of my locked room I sleep in and I often find the wall blown open. I have really great deals and actually think of my intimidating base design as a kind of meta-quest. As a muta-cyborg-gouhl I'm fairly well humored, I positively glow. Really tho, I love the voice actors for the gouhls and the character work there.
---
I have been running a Solo Sneaky Sniper since January 2nd, 2019...here's my 2 caps on this...
---
Instigating is the way to go. 90% of the time you will be clearing a room or area before any of the enemies even know you're there. Your main weapon will be a Hunting/Sniper Rifle for long range and a Lever Action/Fixer for mid range. If you're being mobbed by a group, AA or TS are solid ways to go. Furious if you're up against a boss. If you have the carry room, I'd suggest having one Troubleshooters as well...robots suck and it makes clearing Silos and certain events go much much smoother.
---
For your second trait, I go VATS Critical Damage 50 because I am speced as a Critical sniper. FFR is good also, if you don't care about Criticals. Limb damage is ok, but since you're killing most everything in one shot, it doesn't make that much difference.
---
The third trait is where it can get sneaky cool. FR is good for the levers and the Fixers, but the real gem is 250 DR while Reloading on Sniper/Hunting Rifles. The 250 kicks in while reloading and while chambering bullets between shots. It has been this was since the beginning, and it hasn't been patched out...to my knowledge. As long as you keep firing and firing and reloading, you are a beast. West Tek with an Instigating Hunting Rifle with FFR and 250 DR while Reloading is a cake walk.
---
I've been running this build since day 1 (and actually in pretty much every Fallout game) and it is super effective. Sorry if that was long and rambling. I've been at this build for a while and it consistently has been my favorite.
---
It's like a cake day, but irl
---
Thank you all for the great funny responses, but I'm really curious. Maybe u/Ladydevann has the answer?
---
U get fuel with them?
---
There‚Äôs Nukacola in the cola machine,  hard lemonade in the punch bowl, and Nukashine in the keg.
---
Keeping them stocked can be a bit of a bore, but people passing by do seem to appreciate it. (Well maybe not the Nukashine so much...)
---
Yes indeedy.
---
Not really sure what you're trying to say.
---
I really like those perks, they work great on my other toon but I wasn't really sure if they would for this one. What would you use instead? 
---
Travel agent would be swapped in when needed, it's pretty much essential until you're rich haha
---
lol
---
So fuck players, no surprise.
---
this is the stupidest of arguments someone can bring up. don't you have anything else except this nonsens  killer phrase?
---
sure i'm not forced to do so, but why play the game anyway? you are not forced to breath, why do you do it then?
---
Why call them anti-griefers then? They're just griefers.
---
Anti-griefer implies you're the griefer.
---
Given the data mined transmissions, I doubt the Brotherhood force that is coming to Appalachia is going to be what fans of the Brotherhood are thinking it's going to be.
---
I suspect it's going to be the Eastern Brotherhood and the Outcasts story retold. I'm hoping I am very wrong in that assumption.
---
Either way, I will help Paladin Rahmani and see how they progress the over all story of the Brotherhood.
---
How many of those untradable plans are not bought with gold bulions?
---
I'd rather earn valuable in game currencies and other fun camp items than solely earn microtransaction currency for things i'm not really interested in.
---
Would you kindly... Is also a key phrase in bioshock 1.
---
Max blocker is a good idea. I could drop 2 points from endurance and take out the two perks you mentioned, put then in strength, grab another point from elsewhere.
---
I was trying to keep a few points in endurance for health, but is that really necessary if you negate the damage? Hmmmm
---
Cheers for your thoughts
---
It takes a little time, maybe 5-10 mins, but you can wait it out. You'll most likely end up at 76 but at least you can head back and loot the queen\imposter
---
I feel ya. I switched over to Elder Scrolls Online about a month ago and it is very very satisfying and fleshed out after putting in so many hours of FO76.
---
I agree. I think blocker is way better than barbarian for a low strength build
---
That would be awesome, but unfortunately the Platinum Chip is buried under a ton of rubble in Sunnyvale Califonia for the next century and a half
---
I did this with an instigating hunting rifle (can't remember what the second star was), and it was powerful.  But once you get into danger, it was always a problem.
---
I switched out to command (same stat, so just a few new cards) and I wouldn't ever go back.  Instigating was still a good perk, but I've since changed to junkies and am loving it.
---
I like all 3 of mine. :)
---
"balancing" means nerfing everything to the ground. and we know how that went down for them based on the TSE nerf backlash.
---
keep in mind a lot of people see this game as a single player experience or coop at most. I'd actually wager the people who give a \* about a "healthy economy" and such mmo concerns are a minority.
---
Buy atom or kick rocks.
---
He says those lines if he's naked or not though. And it's 'jawn'. It shows up like that in subtitles. Which is West Virginia slang replacing any generic noun. He's a jawn, she's a jawn, that radstag is a jawn, this bottle of Nuka is a jawn, etc.
---
I had that happen once, It cleared up after a restart and an afternoon. I had cancelled and recently restarted at the time (it has been a rather tempestuous muse), and the whole serververs were recently down that day (last week?). With this game try not to freak about the glitches, embrace that radioctive shit as a kind of meta-luck RNG bro.
---
Unyielding is the only answer here. I would add that for secondary effect you want 1 sneak and one AP bonus at the minimum.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, you can hold down shift or tab while scrolling to speed it up considerably.
---
Pretty much all of the NPCs involved in both faction's quest are interesting and I wish there was more interaction with them after the quests. Except for Johnny. He can die in a fire.
---
Hopefully we'll see more in the future if they add more story content. It would be easier to re-use characters anyway.
---
I work. I‚Äôm probably in the top 2-5% of income earners. My entire point is why would someone buy an entire season ($120
---
Buys 1500 atoms btw). That would mean they don‚Äôt even play the game seeing as you earn score just by getting xp. Why would you spend $120 on a game you don‚Äôt play? Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Thanks, guess I‚Äôll just hope it clears itself up.
---
I havent really thought much about gunslingers..
---
but I think off the top of my head.. without wanting to stray TOO far from your posted build I might run it more [Like This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=66685fa&amp;d=ad2ak2al2a30p02pb2lt2lu0cu2ic4c72el0e00sg2e82a72a01sv0l71sb0lr2s60em0cm0lv0&amp;m=c58)
---
Faster fire rate is a perfect secondary for it
---
Yea, if the ammo is costing more than 1 cap a piece then you are getting ripped off (there is an exception for certain high level ammo). But any ammo you are using low level should only cost 1 cap.
---
Another advice is to collect different types of weapons that way you can switch off to another weapon when you run low on a certain type of ammo.
---
I‚Äôm kinda jazzed on the ghillie skins for armor.  I like it.
---
I killed that bitch in every playthrough of nv
---
I want to earn it legitimately but thanks I do appreciate it
---
If I don‚Äôt breathe I die if you don‚Äôt play Fallout 76 nothing will happen, also the question why play the game anyway is easy to answer, it‚Äôs fun and I like playing it.
---
Pledge room is the best Easter egg in the game hands down
---
Yeah I mean I‚Äôm not opposed to seasons. I just wish they would‚Äôve tossed in some more atoms instead of some of those rewards that nobody will use. Then at least you have the freedom to choose what you WILL actually use.
---
"Seasons are going to be free for ALL our players."  WHEW
---
Save them for when seasons come out so you can skip some grind
---
so you have a vending machine with one of every single plan on sale (for 30000 caps each I assume)? might I suggest also selling plans for cheap in another vending machine? Cos I have a lot of plans I'm willing to donate for that!
---
At least you didn't revive with the pylon damage over time draining your health and killing you and then draining your health and killing you repeatedly until you shut the game off. Happens to me every time.
---
Do you mean SCRAP?
---
since the game was launched, the only thing I have taken from the atom shop that wasnt the weekly free mcguffin is the Bye Now emote.. and I got it on sale half off.. lol
---
Not too many. Bow plan, compound bow plan, small backpack plan from top of my head.
---
Gotta love the light foot perk
---
Wait until you find something that you really really want on the store instead of buying something that is 'ok'. The store items switch out every week. If you spend it on something you do not really want now, you might regret it the following week when something better comes along. 
---
That is the trap!
---
Hello. Nope not quite. The character just has them all on their person and you trade with them to see the plans. There are 1300ish plans so they wouldn't fit in a vendor. Also some are worth more than 30k so people might buy them ;-)
---
Scoce?
---
Public events, earning xp, and completing challenges will give you ‚Äús.c.o.r.e.‚Äù  Each rank will require a certain amount of score to advance to the next level. No idea how much is earned or required at each level but presumably it increases as you go up.
---
Sounds good. Will make an announcement
---
Thats fine. Its turning garbage I drop into something I can use.
---
Yeah. Im glad that i now can see if i already know a plan but why the fuck do they still not have pictures of what you can actually build with them? This stuff seems like basic necessary features.
---
Nice one :)
---
Who said it will dispense water? None of the people you are replying to said that.
---
I thought about that. The main problem is that you need to actually press a key to trade with someone so I need to be at the keyboard
---
other people also work, i don't think you can represent them all. 
---
just look at f2p and mobile games. all signs point to this kind of clients.
---
if you think this don't make sense just search for mobile or f2p whales. funny i have to mention this, everyone should know this yet. be happy that you don't get it, this still doesn't change the fact that there are people out there who pay insane prices for online stuff.
---
My instigating pipe revolver rifle is a beast sniper.
---
Fantastic. I will link you up to the Xbox folks. Can you DM me for a link to the discord
---
Yes
---
This doesn't work for inspecting a cosmetic to see what it looks like though.
---
oh right I see. (I said 30000 caps cos I thought that was the cap limit, am I wrong there?)
---
Rip there goes my hopes of seeing how the gauss shotgun does in U20
---
You are correct. Just some plans people do "trade only" so 30k caps might be a good deal
---
I've never received that challenge. I always find a bunch of it on the bowl at the pumpkin house
---
the edit shows what a shitshow reddit is sometimes.
---
I must've visited your camp yesterday. I just opened someone vending door and started tripping the fuck out immediately
---
Logically, playing video games rather than improving yourself mentally and physically is nonsensical.
---
They like the game, they can do what they want with how they approach it.
---
Yep did it to me yesterday. Around late afternoon i went to hop from public to private and said i needed to repurchase it. Even though the money was In my account and it wasn‚Äôt up for renewal until till today. Tried restarting the game and completely restarting my computer. Nothing. Then It renewed today and works just fine now. 
---
Best guess Bethesda is either still getting things back in order from the big server crash last week or something is up communication wise between fallout 1st and steam. May was my first month actually purchasing it so i don‚Äôt know if this is a common issue on other platforms.
---
Wait, when was griefing disabled? Last week (a little over maybe) a lvl 600 dude destroyed my wife's camp with a .50 machinegun
---
Get a collectron station and then you can buy anything else. Don't use atoms in repairs kits as you don't need them to repair items, you can use junk to repair, also you can get them while playing. And don't waste any atom to level up the season because it's not worth 150 atoms per rank and they will remove challenges to get atoms.
---
###
---
Love this post. I guess nothing strange happened today like I thought.
---
I like houses personality in a few ways, but I don't like how he decided to go the logical route &amp; plan to outright destroy the BOS.
---
it's literaly only the login and character servers to merge. 
---
developers with some basic skills should have no trouble to manage it within a few days. ofc, speaking of bethesda,  they better not screw around anything on the servers or in general. they break more then they improve.
---
Yeah this was my first month of it too, well I hope it gets sorted.  I doubt it‚Äôs connected, but I bought the settler/raider pack today, just a thought.
---
Ended up overencumbered in the bog at level 15 or so my first time. You know how hard it is to run away from a Scorchbeast when you've never seen one before and you can't run anyway? I died so many times. I was still operating under FO4 logic, so I didn't want to loose all that valuable junk!
---
And I thought what was sinking the ship was a lack of end game content.
---
All these people advising looking for coat hangers and shopping baskets when West Tek will net easily 600-800 steel - plus caps, ammo, wood.
---
Right got it. So it‚Äôs an actual player then? That‚Äôs a good work around. Is it controlled by a human or have you written a script for it?
---
Edit: NVM I saw your response to another comment. So your plan is to respond to each player personally. That's a pretty big undertaking, especially if you plan to do it for free!
---
i just played spongebob remastered yesterday and they had more bad words then fallout 76.
---
Kinky.
---
Today character looks smashing! Maybe that's why I haven't seen a single player with the new gear.
---
if you managed to get to the quest, you're fine.
---
cosmetics, camp items or skins.
---
do NOT buy repair or scrap kits. please, don't.
---
That would be awesome!
---
I put beer
---
Ooh thats a good idea. Russian roulette but not death
---
&gt; I'm trying to be excited about the seasons but the lack of the how and other information makes me a bit cautious. 
---
That's your problem. Don't force yourself to get hyped about something. It'll only set yourself up for unrealistic expectations and disappoint.
---
If you're not organically excited about it now, it's because what they've presented isn't exciting to you right now.
---
That might change in a week when it gets released but best not to work yourself up necessarily.
---
Exactly. Controlled by a human... Me :) so needs me to be logged in
---
I think you‚Äôre missing my point about if they need to buy the entire season it means they don‚Äôt even play the game...
---
Also the weight of your equipped armor
---
I‚Äôm trying to stay optimistic, but the recent announcement is making it seem like it‚Äôs going to be a slog.
---
Yeah, Bethesda MASSIVELY nerfed the amount of atoms you can earn and put what atoms we can earn behind a grind wall.
---
Bethesda were intentionally misleading when we'd say we'd get less. If people knew back before that it'd be this much of a nerf, they would have kicked up a lot more of a fuss back then.
---
Typical Bethesda lack of transparency.
---
If they don‚Äôt play the game... i.e. don‚Äôt earn xp and therefore need to buy an entire season... how can they like the game? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
That is a valid and popular opinion. Mostly, of all of this comes down to personal preference and playstyle. Personally, I don't like wasting bullets. I don't like spending my non-fighting time looking for and making ammo. I like the efficiency of one shot one kill. I like hitting the first enemy and watching the others run around looking for me and silently taking them out one my one. That's my jam.
---
It comes down to how you want to play. Sure, overall, Bloodied and Junkies builds do the most raw damage over time...but so much of that is wasted. Its the difference between killing an enemy with 1000 Damage vs 600 Damage...they both are dead. The extra 400 just feels like a waste to me. Again, comes down to personal preference and playstyle. In Fallout, Min-Maxing just doesn't appeal to me.
---
He's not a hacker, just a massive piece of human garbage. Eventually the SBQ will only tickle you but until you've got good armor and perks she can certainly be rough on you.
---
Got a link for the rewards?
---
I feel like there's a nicer way to say the game sucks but I get your point and it's duly noted :)
---
Now I also want a chocolate fountain!
---
I am also specced as a Crit Sniper, so I think that is actually what I would choose. As for the troubleshooters, I've never had an issue with any bots. I always target their CIs and it either downs them or comes pretty close, and breaks their CI.
---
Sentry Bots I always target Fusion Cores and VATS shoot instantly to 1 hit them. Pretty cheesy but as Todd would say, *shrugs* works.
---
Why do people buy posters or pictures and hang them on walls? They don‚Äôt *use* them, do they?
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just get on once in a while, not hardcore grind and just enjoy the world for a bit.
---
Hell, I myself will likely be buying some ranks as I doubt I‚Äôll get farther than maybe 30-40 levels. I‚Äôve got other things I want to do than just fo76.
---
At least 2, so it's symmetrical. or 4 so you can put one at each corner of the camp. Given how weak they are, I wish they'd overhaul the defense system and put them on automated at least.
---
The ‚Äúseason pass‚Äù format is just another tumor on this game
---
Its an online game. They have ongoing costs with servers, officer rent, and developer costs for the game, but if they want to make money to pay for all this, well, then it is greed. That is just ridiculous. A game with ongoing costs need ongoing income, or it will be shut down. They are a company, with private owners who has made investments, they are in this specifically to make money, not to give away free entertainment.
---
How is this a suprise? Of course they need money to keep going. Of course they need a profit margin to not be shut down by the owners. How is any of this still a surprise to people?
---
I think it‚Äôs a step in the right direction to keep things interesting, just a little underwhelmed initially
---
people also can buy everything to have it instantly after the first two weeks, also if someone log in in the last few days they have to buy to obtain everything.
---
i highly doubt that someone who play the game frequently each few days will pay, but some who only log in each few weeks or so will if they're up to. like i said, the whole system is made for this people = limited time, 150 atoms each rank like other season pass handle it and limited currency as reward. we get 1500 atoms in total, the whole season take 1500 to purchase (like for the next episode).
---
IMO other than atoms, perk packs are the only thing I want.. so I can spend them on legendary perks.. and to a lesser degree the other currencies too I guess...
---
Im not a builder or cosmetics guy tho so take that for what it is..
---
-Edit for spelling
---
Would be a step in the right direction if they didn't drastically nerf the atom rewards and pad it out with a lot of grind filler. Separating the skins was especially annoying to make it appear like there's more than there really is.
---
And are you selling them at default value?
---
This season being a "generous gift" is laughable. Everything they add, content wise, is just to perpetuate peoples' habits to log in daily (notice how 99% of end game content is time gated and grindy?) and thus maintain the potential that people buy atoms. 
---
I'm sure they would have removed earnable atoms altogether if they thought they could get away with it without yet another round of bad PR for this game and their brand. Earnable atoms were one of the only ways people let the atom store slide to begin with and now look at how Bethesda is squeezing that out.
---
I almost can't wait to see how they apply all the grifting skills they learned here in starfield. It should be a laugh.
---
Every time I see this post, I read it as "We Want Eazy!", and then I start rapping. Geez, I'm old.  :(
---
I sang this lol
---
Good advice to all.  It‚Äôs Thursday. This drops tuesday.  It reads to me as being daily rewards, weekly, and no daily gating with XP and events.  I‚Äôm guessing 1-2 hours a level is 2 for casual, 1 for nose to the grindstone
---
Control key = fast scroll
---
Conrtol+Shift= really fast scroll
---
here, take a look:
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_pass#:\~:text=Battle%20passes%20were%20then%20seen,continued%20to%20play%20the%20game.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_pass#:~:text=Battle%20passes%20were%20then%20seen,continued%20to%20play%20the%20game.)   
---
there you get a better explanation then i could word it out.
---
How are they not making money? Your speaking as if they aren‚Äôt already making money from the atoms shop?
---
How are you allegedly griefing low level players, at least according to the "anti-griefers"?
---
Finally!
---
That can be easily abused though.
---
lmao
---
yeah...  i have no interest in the 9 ghillie suits, pip-boy paint, power armor paints, space suits, weapon skins.  it really is mostly shit that i would never get, because i would never want it.  what i do want is to not have them, to avoid them cluttering up the purchased section of the atom shop.  the most appealing thing in there is the atoms, secondly the ammo converter.
---
Just giving me Pulp Fiction vibes.
---
"Get the gimp" hahaha
---
Oh yeah this reminds me. How often do you run into the issue where your crits say they deal damage, and their health visually drops until you leave VATS and no damage was actually dealt.
---
This is annoying
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Bye bye
---
I get that, and hats off for the Crit Sniper. I see you are also a person of culture. I use the Troubleshooters because I hate when they sometimes explode after targeting the CI...that and forgetting I didn't have my Fall Damage gear on are the main ways I die in this game. If you are able to remember to get out of the way when it happens (as I never remember to do), then Instigating is the way to go.
---
The other upside, the way I see it, is Cost. You are more likely to find a decent Instigating piece for a reasonable price than a Junkies or Bloodied...not to mention adding Explosive into the mix. Add in bullets usage and repairing...the Instigating Sneaky Crit Sniper is the Frugal Wastelanders friend.
---
I'm pursuing this exact task. I've got a decent way to go, missing 2 of the rarest plans and many of the mission reward plans plus a majority of the expensive PA plans sold by vendors. With a group effort, I think it could be done.
---
I love that idea.
---
I hope it keeps giving you atoms and other filler items every x ranks above 100 like other systems
---
I heard but really haven‚Äôt looked but since I‚Äôve never used any atoms can those be used to skip the score system
---
best in slot would be bloodied, if you want to build your whole loadout, perks, armor and playstyle around that.
---
if not, instigating is ok to farm midlevel enemys, but drop explosive - giantpunda already pointed out why. also, combat rifle isn't that good, same for the hunting rifle - there are better options for both of them like handmade (full automatic) or lever (bolt action). for stealth i use a full-auto fixer with firerate and vats cost, for a lever i would use vatscrit damage and vats cost as additional legendary effects.
---
these weapons are hard to get tho, since they are top tier.
---
If you are on PS4, add me (IrradiatedSalmon). I run this with a crew, and we have been farming it all week. I now have both full outfits and 3 extra fixer plans.
---
In what way?
---
The one method I can think of would be people selling atoms for caps. However, atoms are worth way more than caps. At this point, caps are like toilet paper (before coronavirus)
---
Laughable huh? Griefing griefers is one of the only reasons why I still play this game. It yields a much more satisfying reward
---
More since wastelanders. I've submitted a ticket about it, so we'll see...but yeah. That is frickin' annoying. Happens with Gulpers a lot for me. It's to the point where I subconsciously plan for it to happen and over shoot more often than not. I really hope its addressed.
---
Trust me, I get that!  That's why I played a sniper for my first 150ish levels.  
---
For me, after a while, it was just more efficient (and for me, safer) to make that change...and I was looking for something new anyway.  PA never really appealed to me for day to day play, and melee is just too...bland.  It was a simple change, that I could change back to if it didn't work out without any hassle.  And I'm at a point where I just buy ammo when I get below ~10K 5.56, so it's not much of a chore to keep stocked up.
---
I still swap back every so often just to see those big sneak headshot numbers, I'm just more interested in efficiency to make better use of my limited time (or was, before the lockdown anyway, that's a lot less of an issue these days).
---
People will find a way, and knowing that there are so many exploiters and mechanic abusers in this community, oh boy they will. Something like this Bethesda simply cannot afford.
---
Sheepsquatch have a lot of hp.  Aside from event bosses, they‚Äôre probably the hardest enemy to put down.  Don‚Äôt get too discouraged.
---
You get a 10% chance to earn the plan by participating in Encryptid, the event at the end of the quest chain you‚Äôre working on.
---
You‚Äôll get a card to start it at the end of the last quest.  Before you activate it, check the map to see how many high lvl players are on your server.  If there‚Äôs 4-5, go for it.  Just wait until people start showing up before using the terminal.  You have 8 minutes, so don‚Äôt get impatient.  It‚Äôs best to just chill out and let the ultra geared players do the heavy lifting.
---
Best of luck!
---
Sounds like a good idea, until all you get is everyones daily photos of Meg and a saw mill
---
Sounds great, but I'm always sceptical of these types of systems.
---
Where you would be noble, expect someone else to find a way to exploit it.
---
It takes some practice but you can aim manually with it... And it's incredibly satisfying.
---
Imma pass on this. Doing the same shit we've been doing for almost two years for very lackluster rewards. Its not worth my time.
---
Also, you know wood ghillie suits right? Like, whoa....
---
nice roll, congrats. got the same one from fasnacht.
---
since the bullets have a pretty long traveltime, i wish i had  a B/33/25vatscost.
---
I'm honestly pretty broke so I'm looking for something more mid-tier. Im looking at maybe an I Vats Vats hunting rifle. Should be a good upgrade and not too pricy.
---
Could be related to the atom shop but I‚Äôm not sure. Since i did buy the liberty prime power armor skin with atoms i had saved up before my private server started acting up. I did submit a ticket to Bethesda this morning.  I don‚Äôt expect anything to come of it but Might be worth doing that as well if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
No?
---
are you on pc? i'm hoarding a shitload of weapons, i might have something you need to gift away. if yes i would take a look.
---
you realize the entire settler faction is communist right?
---
PS4. I appreciate the offer though.
---
This is what my Gunslinger/Cowboy build looks like. Works really well. I just finished it yesterday, so feel free to tweak it to your needs. With the right pistol (+Crit. Fill), every fourth shot is a crit. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=17a53ff&amp;d=ad2ak2al2a81a72la2l71lu2i12c72p02pk0pd0pl0sb0ek1eo2ej4pp0lv2lr2lt0ap0cu0&amp;m=f5c29e83&amp;n=Pistol
---
so when‚Äôs this going live?
---
Oh, I see you mean. Like with the duppers and stuff. So people might find a way to dup the atoms. That makes sense. I did not think of that.
---
I guess if they were to try to impliment something like this, it would have to be on the atom store side and not be involved in the game in any way. In other words, it cannot be something like an in game gift that you give to something. It would have to be a Atom Store purchase that you can then assign a username to and it will mail it to them. They would then be able to open it in the atom store.
---
There's the flag, a backpack, an outfit and a gas mask, all 4 of which are rare rewards. The outfit and gas mask are the same blue &amp; red retextures of the Railroad Armored Coat from Fallout 4 and Assault Gas Mask that various Blue Ridge NPCs wear. If you want better chances, you should collect all 4 extra supplies; one always spawns before the ambush that you have to clear with explosives, one always spawns near the Blood Eagle captain halfway through, and two always spawn after the gate. I recommend searching for the first one as soon as you initiate the intro dialogue, and then search for the other 3 after you kill the captain but before you open the gate. Works every time for me.
---
I have a camp in that same pylon but at the bottom. I really love that place especially with the raiders that come to hangout every now and then!
---
You can't "scrap" a legendary weapon. I assume you mean "scrip"?
---
You mean scrip? .. you might get some caps for that puppy
---
 [RMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy)
---
r/punpatrol *chhk* we got a live one
---
I don't even know what these freaks can think of, they're the tumors of this game.
---
Mines always full of NukaShine. Will never not be.
---
I'm trying to spearhead the ps4 side of the effort. I need to go into the checklist and get an exact list of which plans I'm missing, I've got a lot already but I'm probably missing a couple hundred still, many od which are vendor sold PA mod plans.
---
Thanks. I was just saying that the only way this could be more op (read: broken) was if it had reduced vats cost and increased vats hit chance.
---
Agreed by chance the other day I was buying and selling with randoms and a guy had the assult rifle plan turns out I dobt know that one. Saddly he left and I couldnt recall his name. 
---
Also Im at 65/66 on pipe mods and its driving me crazy.
---
I would give you your head back but I can't tell if this one is yours or Cook-Cook's.
---
Surrender Cash or Return Empty
---
down in the Q&amp;A they say we also rank up with gaining exp.
---
so farming enemys should do the trick to boost it up.
---
Anyone have the radiation barrel plan for sale on xb1? Or can it even be traded?
---
Gt - jt2slow
---
Yes they can be
---
If it's max level you could get a few thousand caps
---
That‚Äôs one way of interpreting things I guess.
---
I love the Captain Cosmos skin, but it's a re release of FO4, which had a ton of colors and power armor mods that actually changed its appearance. Here it's just the standard black and white
---
Idk how people defend this game.
---
true for someone like me who doesn't maximize the amount of atoms I make a month And has about one billion unusable  Ammo an ammo converter is pretty sweet.  tho I guess they could just add the ammo converter and keep things the way they are
---
Bugged.  Still works on railway and I believe gamma gun but otherwise busted.
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs just...nearly every line...she says...have these annoying.....pauses.
---
or bugs, exploits, bad support, lies, false promises, cut content, deleted content, sellout mechanics and so on.
---
but no, it's literaly only the bad Power Armor which is underpowered compared to decent legendary armor. BAN POWER ARMOR NOW BETHESDA, if you ever read any word our comunity is writing...
---
Unless you know the mods for a radium or something. I put that in a separate category lol. Those are hard to get to sometimes
---
The literal main point of the main quest is to re-establish a currency which is basically just restarting capitalism.
---
But yeah, not wanting your friends to die so you work together is definitely communism. That's why every nation in the world is communist, clearly.
---
My god get a better grasp of actual communism other than a Facebook post before saying something this dumb.
---
I would agree
---
People just want it to have a sink in their CAMP bathrooms. I know I do. Who gives a rad-rats arse what water it puts out, I have a purifier in the pond for that.
---
Can use it with explosive weapons due to splash damage. Explosive lasers still do good in PvP vats
---
No, definetly not, they are just in a situation where they have to share mean, they literally have the sunny bots
---
I know, I want a sink for my kitchen area too, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôll most likely not be purified is all
---
I feel this. Played the beta, defended Bethesda ferociously, eventually realized they really weren't going to miraculously fix many of the bugs and I honestly could not stand the lack of NPCs. Quit playing. Came back just recently after wastelanders, and initially it was fun, MUCH better than what it was... But I'm getting more and more annoyed again.
---
You're right, OP builds are rampant and I'm one of them, twice. Leveled up a melee build and could kill absolutely everything in sight. Started a new character, took about 5 days to get to 50, and she is once again OP with barely even trying. I do have one magic shotgun that I just recently starting playing with, but even without that, my Fixer two shots everything. Which, okay, I could just downgrade I guess. But then you also have the fact that vats works like .2% of the time, rubberbanding enemy health, mobs despawning as soon as you kill them, getting to the queen right after the bomb and realizing she's already been killed, empty events, or people not knowing how to even do the event correctly... It's all just getting to be sooooo damn frustrating again.
---
Like yeah, seasons *could* be cool, but I would so much rather Bethesda work on *fixing the problems* than just throwing new stuff at us. But we all know that will never happen because we're all just dealing with the problems and they have no incentive to fix anything.
---
haha same i was slightly jaded at the time but it super funny now
---
I would say they are Communistic in the same way Native Americans kinda were. Though my knowledge is lacking in this area, Native Americans did have personal property, but the tribe did daily jobs for the betterment of the tribe. And everyone had equal and equitable reward for doing their job

Happy Birthday!  I‚Äôm sorry I unplugged you

Don‚Äôt think you bought it it‚Äôs always been a free item.

---
Check the Copper Section.
---
So many times I've fast traveled, and before the screens recovered from blackness; "OH, I FINALLY FOUND YOU!" right in my damn ear.
---
My poor heart cant take it much more.
---
tag it for search you'd be surprised...
---
Golf club yo. Golf club.
---
Good to know lol I traded all mineüò©
---
This game is a literal free for all wasteland at this point. It‚Äôs too far gone for Bethesda to really care about anything but milking whatever microtransactions they can out of it. I‚Äôve never in my life played a game with so many constant bugs and exploits. I think the only reason people still play this game is just the gambling sensation of RNG and trying to get perfect rolls on weapons and armor. Everything outside of that is some of the most stale gameplay I‚Äôve ever experienced. I look at this whole game as an experiment or beta to see how an online fallout game would work and now we all know that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust work‚Äù.
---
Heh, all the 1950's anti-communist propaganda in the fallout universe, this would be a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing that Fallout humor does.
---
yea i would mostly agree there faction logo is also reminiscent of the classic hammer and sickle i just got worker party vibes from them. though i don't know if they have personnel property
---
A step in the right direction would be listening to player complaints before trying some Fortnite inspired money grab. The Early estimates to comp the season are 2 to 3 hours a day i‚Äôm trying to play video game not a part-time job
---
76ers are the best faction.. we fuk shit up like nobodys business...
---
hehe yea i think it would be pretty funny and i guess in away they portray communist the way capitalist see them and capitalist the way communist see them. i love fallout
---
So I think this is a joke, he often ruins my stealth approach. I thought maybe it was an intended pun, so he is the "missed-surprise bot" XD. Usually his gifts are pretty worthless and get me killed - pretty hilarious
---
He's been there since the beginning, not sure why you never seen him around
---
Do the mining public and private events. Go in with Excavator armor and come out with enough ores to last for several days.
---
Right?! I was hoping they would‚Äôve opened it when wastelanders came out
---
ugh.. you can have the rest of mine.. lol
---
cant shoot it in the face to death fast enough..
---
Both. For the free fuel, I have to craft them first. Then I scrap them.
---
Wait, the hell is copper even used for? I never see it in any of my recipes. Then again all I craft is heavy weapons power armor and ammo types that start with 5
---
Yeah, 100 with every craft.
---
&gt; we've been noticing a steady decline in Fallout 76's player numbers following Wastelanders.
---
we have?
---
Xbox :( but thanks for the offer!
---
X-01 crafting  (mind im very new to the game)
---
max starched genes so you dont lose it.. yes
---
So I take the serum and then equip the card?
---
For me it's the Insult Bot. That thing will chase me down and wade right through a massive fire fight and explosions like the Terminator 2 T-1000 just to get to me.
---
Yes, starched genes prevents you from losing the mutation if you take a rad-x
---
30th if they don't delay it.
---
yeah. when you have level 2 starched genes perk radaway won‚Äôt remove the mutation so you can still remove rads. however you can‚Äôt get any mutations from rads anymore
---
hope this helps!
---
Yeah meant scrip. I‚Äôm not bloodied and it seems only a BE will do for most now days.  I‚Äôll toss it in the machine for a couple k thanks
---
also.. if you plan to take a million mutations.. youll probably want Class Freak too to mitigate some of those downsides...
---
You both are out the caps.
---
Yeah I heard about that
---
Wren made a comment about me wearing a responders unformed earlier (daily atom) and I was shocked by how sentient they are.
---
She said ‚Äúyou 76‚Äôers‚Äù trying to be good or something
---
No, they still pay the caps. They just disintegrate on your end is all, recieve nothing. Rough sometimes.
---
it almost seems too easy doesnt it..
---
It‚Äôs only difficult for me because I‚Äôm bored of doing the same three quests over and over and FUCKING OVER!
---
There, I said it. Now downvote me Todd‚Äôs batty Boys!
---
Very lol
---
Some amazing shots!
---
So Todd gets the caps? That motherfucker.
---
It's easier smelt, copper veins like the massive one at WS,  S of the bunker will give you lots of ore. Then there's veins near the WS station.
---
If you put on a completed Excavator PA you get 4 everytime you poke it instead of just one. 
---
Other than that, I find most copper from the small red tool boxes, usually near PA harness too in the form of magnets &amp; fuses. Like the ones at the Blackwater mine entrance. 
---
Edit-typo
---
I have the excavator power armor already, im looking to finish my first X-01
---
Thank you , it‚Äôs because it seemed weird I took the serum and then I put the card
---
personally I dont take more than I need.. Id rather spend the CF point/s on damage..
---
I understand this is not normal.. lol YMMV
---
GL to you too
---
I dunno man, being able to earn all the fucking skins I wanted rather than be given bullshit I‚Äôm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever FUCKING EVER gonna use is a pretty shitty trade off. Especially since I can‚Äôt even earn the atoms to buy *one* skin I actually want.
---
all good! 
---
also you can take serums with the perk card on to :)
---
Aye, indeed.   
---
 [https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/)
---
I wear a Vault Suit under armor.. I would never wear some other factions garb.. fuck those guys.. Im out here doin work
---
*unless the game makes me or I cant advance.. lol
---
Santatron stopped giving me and my girlfriend any kind of food with wastelanders.
---
WHATTTYTTT FERB I KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TODYA
---
Wait, Jesus is a ally?
---
You use it in nuclear winter if everyone votes Flatwoods, since that map has crap loot spawns lol
---
Yes, the assault rifle plan is quite rare. A friend of mine just gave me a copy yesterday to put towards this task. 
---
I know 2 people that have 66/66 for pipes, but they have the same exact mods as I do (65/66) so we're guessing the mod was something only available in the early days as both the players I know that have it played during beta.
---
Why should people be pleased by something that eliminates an existing system that they currently use? They could have easily left the existing challenge system in place AND added seasons (without atoms among the selection of awards). The only reason to do this is to limit how many free atoms people are getting in game, by a tremendous margin.
---
I hardly post here because I play the game most days, typically enjoy myself, have few issues with the game, and there isn't too much to say. 
---
But I'm likely going to quit over this.
---
Yes! Everyone loves her as much as me. I want to fix her collar and have her at my camp swearing like a trooper! Please, Bethesda.
---
Yep, when I am low on fuel, I just craft 50 low level flamers, thats 5000 free fuel. Then I scrap them to get some materials back.
---
Serums bypasses stashed genes, so you don't need to bother removing the perk. If you need to shutdown mutations for a while taking a radx will remove the effect while it Last or until you take the diluted variant
---
Ah okay thank you :)
---
And it stays forever right? I really don‚Äôt know how this works sorry
---
Hard to tell, but I suspect it requires you sell or buy a specified amount of the ammo for the points listed.  So you sell 3 missiles for 60 points, but if you wanted to buy a stack of 3 missiles for some insane reason, it's 250 points
---
*Hugs*
---
I haven‚Äôt, what is it?
---
The legendary perks and boss aren't coming on the 30th?
---
And I‚Äôd also like to add, they didn‚Äôt even give us everything promised with Fallout 1st. We don‚Äôt get regularly updated Fallout 1st exclusive items. We don‚Äôt get persistent workshops. We don‚Äôt get larger camp budget as advertised. Nope, none of the shit they said they‚Äôd work into Fallout 1st and the private worlds has come to light.
---
Is this offer still valid? I‚Äôm thinking about buying fo76 and haven‚Äôt played fall out 4 in years. I miss it though and I‚Äôm a huge fan of Bethesda.
---
It is not.
---
Faction dailies can easily be completed in less than 15 minutes for 9 T. notes, and you only need to do a few public events to make up the other 11 for the day. It's easy enough to earn them, so why don't you help your friend do that? Pretty sure the notes can't be dropped anyway.
---
Alright thank you lol guess it‚Äôs grind time then lmao
---
&gt; possible
---
He didn‚Äôt really wanna grind cause we just grinded for so long to get to 50
---
We don't know how much time it will really take for the challenges at this point.  Once they get revealed, it will be easier to figure out a more realistic total.
---
Eh, I'm putting that on the person more than the company. 
---
Honestly, someone lacking that kind of self control should probably just not be on the internet, they are going to get taken, hard, by far worse than the legendary run if that is the case.
---
dont SBQs spawn other SBs too sometimes?
---
seems like theres always more than 1 when I go to them..
---
also Butchers Bounty works no?
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake.
---
I was thinking of doing something like this but nuke whitesprings
---
Make sure to pick Reaper's sprint in luck to spam Vats
---
This nearly broke me when i did it too. Like you I got to two multiple times and couldnt get the 3rd before they spoiled. My advice would be to get some friends to help. Even if its just all checking the nests at Watoga because each friend will have their own loot draw from the nest container. The nests seem to be a good rate of drop of at least some scorchbeast meat so hopefully between friends you can get enough.
---
EDIT to add another way is to ONLY take out the scorchbeast meat from the nests and server hop. Hopefully whatever else is left in the container will reroll to meat. I dont know how effective that will be but I use this method on Tech Data
---
Again, butcher's bounty is great - for drowning me in lungs, livers, hearts and brains. Not one of the SBs I killed dropped Meat for my bucther's bounty to double.
---
As for the SBQ, I only just got my tenth commendation for I am Become Death while halfway through my farming spree and haven't actually gone back to the Enclave bunker yet - though that is a good point, I could make a point to join the next Scorched Earth event, so that's worth trying. Might not work as well as I'd like, since others could get the kill, but worth a try.
---
So thanks for that suggestion.
---
Hey me and a friend (ps4) was stuck at the assaultron, she wouldn't come out. As a last resort I picked up a super sledge and started power swinging at it worked !!!
---
After 10 hits she died and the door opened !!!
---
If you can get in on a three Scorched Earth chain you'll have all the meat you could need in no time.
---
Another tip with mutations is if you ever use RadX make sure you use a diluted variant, this way you won't suppress any of your mutation effects. ü§ó
---
Thanks Hairy Nipple Dongs
---
Pls help im lvl 244 and still don't have incisor perk ..what am I doing wrong?!  Ive asked before on here but just get laughed at/ mocked.
---
Progressing through the pass will be the new motivation. Which imo is a much better one since sure, you dont get as many atoms, but tbh Bethesda has hardly put anything worth buying into the shop recently anyway, and most of the stuff in the pass if pretty sweet
---
...I don't actually have that many friends who play 76. But I could get my friend to help once they have the level to survive cranberry bog/do Mayor for a day (so they're not fighting endless robots), though I can also help them with that.
---
Thanks. That would help.
---
Their hammer logo just needs a sickle and I'd be a tad concerned, but no they're not communists. They're chasing wealth and a headstart on new capitalism in the wasteland.... Which I gave them....
---
Ahh but let‚Äôs say I do accidentally use it will it be suppressed for as long the the rad x last ?
---
Anybody have a picture of this combat rifle skin? If they apply it to the fixer eventually and it looks good then I might have to invest in getting a good fixer.
---
What is a "three Scorched Earth chain?" I've never actually participated in Scorched earth yet (i've had the game for... a month and a half or so)
---
I like your style.
---
This and pictures of in game posters, drawn portraits and comics make me happy
---
Grats
---
that‚Äôs ok. it‚Äôll stay until you take the perk off and use radaway
---
Well, I'm a function over looks/cosmetic people, so I'm happy about the change, but I'm still new on the game, so can't say much, still low level so those perk card , ammo converter, caps, gold n script is what i need most,
---
My punch bowl is always full of Nukashine.  I have toilets next to the table it sits on with a sign above that reads ‚ÄòFor Nukashine Vomit‚Äô
---
Ah okay thank you helped a lot
---
Try the server hopping then as I put in my edit. In theory items left in a container will reroll
---
all good :)
---
Yes, but, if you then use a diluted RadX after, it will override the effects of the full version. Giving you back your hoppy skills!
---
Yeah gifting crowns in ESO could go awry sometimes.... So dicey.... I never got fleeced but many guildies have. I dare say Beth wouldn't want that headache....
---
I mean, yes, that was the point of my comment.  That's the point of dry humor.
---
Robots drop a lot of copper scrap, try Robco research facility or any of the 3 nuke silo's if you don't feel like mining it
---
Welcome bud, happy hunting.
---
Well to some yea I suppose lol.
---
I think the American pistol paints were on sale for first users right?
---
To be honest points or material would make me happy. Then add special ammo types like new vegas
---
You too
---
People that farm Scorched Earth will launch a nuke, kill SBQ, launch the next nuke and so on till they've run out of nukes to launch and hop to the next server. It's a fairly common thing, I get in on one every day usually.
---
As long as you deal something like 1500 damage to her before she dies you'll get loot.
---
I absolutely hate it when people do that!!why? Because I cannot resit the punch bowl and I know every time I drink from a punch bowl it is always going to be nukashine. I am right 99.9% of the time yet I still can‚Äôt resist a good punch bowl for shits and giggles.
---
That... actually sounds really good. time consumimg, but less hair-rip inducing. Thank you!
---
when I think of your situation.. it reminds me of the guy who was bemoaning the fact that his base kept getting repeatedly taken out by 3 SBs continually spawning near its location..
---
and I thought.. 
---
FO76 is doing all the right things.. but to the wrong people...
---
Yes, happened to me too, And i experience it before i even finish my brewery quest, so i don't even know what it is,  1st thing I do after drink it is check my monitor cable, after that check my windows, and in the end I realize that my char get really2 drunk üòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
I hope they do, I can already picture the Black on green look!
---
Ah. Okay. Cool. I'll see if I can try that too. I have noticed Scorched Earth sometimes happening in close succession on a single server.
---
and how about a clean unbroken toilet.
---
I think you can actually make your camp at one of her 4 fast travel points from the Deep
---
I still can't believe they had the nerve for Fallout 1st and even more so that people pay for it.
---
oof. RIP that guy.
---
Love this idea. Definitely keen on an xbox one
---
Happy birthday Mr. House!
---
I think the concept is good, it‚Äôs something else to do. I do think the rewards are a little meh...padding things out with the same items for different armors feels a little cheap. That said, there‚Äôs also some really good stuff in there. I only need to get to rank 5 for the ammo converter‚Äîthat‚Äôs shocking. I really thought they‚Äôd torture us with that.
---
Ya problem is steam numbers, I have no idea what the actual balance is but I had to wonder at first if steam accounts were hacked or not they look like a randomized code string g to me, no names or anything readable.
---
Lol u r genius
---
Lmao this post was months ago and bug still exists
---
Ive remained fairly lukewarm on it throughout.. its kind of difficult for me to say because I dont see it in that light..
---
if you wish to keep the mutation yes
---
A man of culture who also recognizes super rare plans. Cheers.
---
I was confused at first as he approach while I was in battle. I didn't understand the 'loot' her gave me as he wandered away. I've encountered him at least 4 times. Ha. Insult bot is my favorite.
---
XP gives you SCORE points. 
---
Low health, unyielding players finish Season 1 in two days. 
---
Patch 21: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made an adjustment to Unyielding armor, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòworking as intended‚Äô and will no longer grant extra XP for INT. We swear, it wasn‚Äôt intended, we didn‚Äôt notice for a year and a half.‚Äù
---
Lol you're joking right? The plasma grenade plan is super common now due to all the players who duped Large Christmas Presents.
---
Mire &amp; Cranberry Healing Salve Recipe and Walking Cane mod plans are Infinitely more rare.
---
Wait... do you seriously think that the fucking seasons are supposed to be a lazy alternative to endgame content?
---
Angry turtle runs round in broken armour and did have an explanation why
---
might be fun to use against low-mid level robots even if youre not speced into handguns to save ammo..
---
I wouldnt want that thing anywhere near me vs high lvl ASSaultrons or some gutsys unless I had a gunslinger build.. YMMV
---
Discord Plan Collectors memebers represent!! *flashes nerdy gang signs*
---
Personally, I've loved fallout 76 since the beginning so I cannot say it even needed a comeback. But I think great comeback stories are the spiritual successors of games. Like kings field for instance turning into games like dark souls and demon souls. Or the great comeback of the adventure games from taleworlds. Adventure games were few and far between once we left the 90s. Also the comeback of crpgs is a beauty to behold. I know you mean game comebacks but I think the gaming industry as a whole is in a reniciansse of sorts when it comes to dying genres. Strategy games are next. Just look at age of empires and command and conquer. Pretty cool stuff.
---
I‚Äôm a seller too. If anyone wants to look though my stash, just let me know. 
---
IGN: xaltedone
---
I actually did the same, but when Wastelanders dropped Bethesda deleted all 50 of mine and I don‚Äôt want to go through the effort of doing it again.
---
Fasnacht collectron only seems to do candy, drinks and bottles
---
not working in my legacy one, prob gives 1 each 10 shoots
---
once i hit 29k i turn vendors off.
---
Am I? I must have missed the part where I spoke like it was so. Can't really find the part where I said that they are not making money either. Did you respond to the wrong post?
---
Wastelanders is definitely a substantial improvement. But one addition isn‚Äôt going to change the narrative‚Äîand it didn‚Äôt with ESO either. It‚Äôs going to take a couple of years of consistent improvements and additions to get it there. It seems like they‚Äôre committed to it, so I‚Äôm hopeful.
---
Yeah I have a bloodied reduced vats cost and it‚Äôs pretty disgusting. My go to weapon outside of power armor. Low dps but one shots almost everything.
---
you can take it with card on, the serum goes through it.
---
also NEVER EVER take card off for any reason.
---
But honestly, what does any of that even matter, given how limited the camp budget  is? I mean they keep giving us new camp shit to grind for when my CAMP budget is maxed out.
---
if there was more new stuff to do.
---
but it's the same ol shit we've been doing forever.
---
are people even doing thosr challenges that curently gives atoms?
---
you should be thankful that they still gives you some
---
I am after doing my first nuke and want to do whitesprings so I'm up for it
---
You can find it on the link I commented earlier, pic‚Äôs a bit small but it‚Äôs good enough to get a general idea of it
---
Hahah that's a really great story to be able to tell. Too funny.
---
Todd needs his money
---
Totally agree. Rarely use power armor. So that rules out alot of stuff for me. And I'm going to use 1 or 2 camo armors. 
---
So 1 skin for all the power armors. 
---
1 skin for all regular armors
---
A bunch of boxes of "useful things" (more bottled water, radaway, and 38 ammo we dont need)
---
Fraction of atoms and miniscule caps gold etc
---
At least the camp things look good....probably would of been a single bundle in the shop though
---
Have to say this new system is terrible and I can see a big drop in players after the 1st week
---
Ah I found that link earlier but couldn‚Äôt see it very well because of how small it was, I was hopping someone found another picture of it by chance.
---
I‚Äôd rather have two sided interior walls tho
---
&gt;So that about sums up my response to seasons after having checked out  the rewards offered, estimations of grind time, and assessing how much  cash I'd have to spend to get the rewards (almost $200 CAD, which is  quite a bad joke). 
---
How the fuck are you estimating ANYTHING about the "grind time" or how much cash you're going to have to spend when the fucking thing isn't even out yet?  
---
We have essentially ZERO information on how this is going to work aside from Bethesda's vague mention of it taking 150 hours of gameplay to finish all 100 ranks.  Zero mention of whether t hat's casual gameplay, hardcore gameplay, if it's gameplay that has to be specifically targeting scoring as many points as possible all the time or if it's just points you're earning on the side while you're just playing the game or if you're going to be severely limited in how many points you can score or if it's even possible to grind points to speed shit up.  Stating that it's going to cost you two hundred dollars when we don't know shit isn't estimating, it's pulling shit out of your ass just to make things look bad.  
---
This is like reviewing a fucking movie that doesn't come out for another week because you watched a trailer on youtube.
---
If a player throws explosive bait at your base they can damage it even without entering pvp.
---
Rifles are meta already.  You are asking for an  even more OP version of an  OP weapon.
---
does he share his perk to walk on water?
---
If I could upvote you more than once I would, those are gorgeous.
---
Why is that?
---
It'd be cool if they included one where you could encounter an Enclave Eyebot roaming around playing the same patriotic marching music as the Eyebot you find in Springvale outside Vault 101 from FO3. :)
---
I would like more quests to get max rank with my faction, I did the Foundation main story gave them half the gold and have been doing the dailies for almost a week and that bar doesnt move. Why cant i have something repeatable like Fallout 4 has. Dont reward xp from it if they are worried about xp boosting just give faction rep.
---
I feel your pain. I have the SS torso needed for the Jetpack and am about 1500 gold away from the actual Jetpack plan :(
---
To answer your question though, no I don't think so.
---
The problem is still the endgame. 76 is a good game, but Beth Austin doesn't seem to know how to create a endgame. 
---
In ESO you can still see that the developers had some previous experience with mmorpg's and it's huge every way. NMS is something quite new and Hello games listens what the customer has to say, even if this means NMS is no longer the game they wanted to do.
---
76 is now in a spot that they have to come up with some good endgame content to keep(or make) people happy.
---
Are you fucking serious?  So do you think that they didn't have any of this shit ready to release on time and decided fuck it lets stop working on the new event and legendary perks and stuff that the players actually want and put all of our effort into pushing out this season shit that's gonna make us that sweet money money money?  
---
If they'd just said fuck it, this other shit isn't ready to release on  time so we're not going to release ANY update for another month you'd be screaming bloody fucking murder about how they should have at least released whatever they did have ready to release.
---
yes.. you get the suit before the mission that locks you in
---
-ETA: I think most people do both sides up to the Siding With mission and then chose
---
Bethesda saves everything for the atom shop. Plus those raider and settler bundles. Hence why the trailers everything looked new but in the end we got a terrible outfit at the end of either questline. 
---
They should add more rare event items in the style of  the fireman out. Travelling coat and asylum variants. But maybe not quite as rare as those
---
I think it's a bit premature to call this a comeback. There are fundamental problem with the game and with the company that still persist and are unlikely to change in the near future. Maybe ever.
---
If you think of all the classic comeback stories that most people are aware of, I think it'd be fair to say that 76 is on the bottom of that list.
---
Bear in mind what it's up against:
---
* No Man's Sky
---
* Final Fantasy XIV
---
* Star Wars Battlefront II
---
* Elder Scrolls Online
---
* The Division
---
* Destiny
---
The only game that Fallout 76 has clearly done better than are those that haven't bounced back like Anthem.
---
There is no question that Wastelanders is an improvement to the game and that it shows signs that the game isn't an entire loss. For a lot of people (myself included) Wastelanders was Bethesda's last chance before giving up on the game, and to be honest, the company overall.
---
What Bethesda does for the rest of the year will be absolutely crucial as to whether or not reaches that comeback status.
---
We're down to a handful needed on XB, but unfortunately some of them are time consuming.  We'll post the status once we finish them off, it's happening!!!
---
A random encounter I would like to see:
---
An npc comes up to me and hands me free atoms. That npc then says (in Todd's voice): sorry we took away the original dailies and weeklies that rewarded atoms.
---
So because Wastelanders was delayed that means they can't delay a single fucking thing from there on out?  The legendary perk system is a fucking joke that has been panned across the board and Bethesda has so far done the SHOCKING thing of seemingly going back to the drawing board with at least some of it and you're bitching and moaning that they won't just release it as the pile of steaming horse shit it currently is.
---
I got the chest and I want the Jetpack. Even without anything to reduce fall damage I can't wait to break my legs!
---
I've only played the game since Wastelanders. Been at it for about two months. I like it but it has turned boring. So I've been tapering off. There just needs to be more to do.
---
Awesome news, thanks!
---
I found a pet possum one time... it lasted a day. My turrets blew it up. Your Beaver friend most likely won‚Äôt last long sadly because the targeting AI of camp turrets is a POS... Lost two pet deathclaws to my own missile turrets.
---
We're doing an xbox version, message me if you have anything uber rare.  We're down to 70 or so but most of them are PA mod plans which will get knocked out tomorrow.  Mire and Bog salves and barbed walking cane are the only real hangups.  And the BOS paints which just plain takes time to get.
---
Heads up. You're going to need stable flux for the jet pack. Can't remember which type.
---
Yeah, I was on this game pretty heavily the first week or two.  But I found myself reinstalling and playing FO4 and NV (mostly NV) again before I hit level 50.  I still stuck around for a bit because I was looking for weapons only to find out that everything I wanted is a legacy weapon &gt;\_&lt;.  
---
Finding out that all the fun stuff is gone but, boy oh boy, they've got 1-star Nocturnal Rolling Pins for days, pretty much killed whatever was left of my desire to play.
---
Because they need a straw man to base their bullshit argument on or else it doesn't work.  This Seasons system has to be one of the most innocuous thing they've added to  the game, we just fucking play and they give us free shit for it, and it's being turned into "BETHESDA IS A BUNCH OF GREEDY LAZY FUCKS AND THEY'RE FORCING US TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO UNLOCK ALL OF THIS CONTENT INSTEAD OF EARNING IT!"
---
Oh shit. Ty for the look out. I ain't got any of that. I legit just sold it all cause it weighs too much. I'll go look it up and try to find how to get some.
---
edit: Takes 5 cobalt and 5 violet.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition!
---
The dialogue is horrendous right now, to make matters worse Rocksy has a habbit of poofing away.
---
If u want the ultimate berz build, fm me.

There are a couple of spots on top of the buildings in watoga where the meat spawns. That's how I got it for the quest.
---
You did the community proud.
---
How do you turn them off? Cutting the power just changes the icon on the map. I've had people purchase stuff with no power on. May just be a glitch. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I legitimately enjoyed scrolling through that collection. Well done.
---
I hope no one calls the company over the house
---
Bethesda has made it very clear that they're not interested in implementing text chat, even as far as a recent interview with massivelyop showing that they know it's the number 1 requested feature but it's not on their radar at all. Certainly not for the foreseeable future.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 desperately needs a method of communication in text form and this feature is essential to giving the Roleplaying community a structurally sound backbone. 
---
Also, this is straight up false. 
---
I've used the text chat mod that's available for PC extensively and I've NEVER in all my many many months using the mod have seen anyone even attempt to roleplay. Absolutely zero character to character local chat (roleplay or otherwise).
---
It's either just shooting the shit in a general chat with inane conversations or actual useful stuff to do with trading items. That's it.
---
Roleplay may be the key of longevity for you. For the rest of us, it's a steady flow of engaging content, however that is manifest.
---
I just want to be able to kill more NPC than the game allows.. too many no name wiseass bigmouths are protected by the game...
---
Ok, so here's a thing: this *is* the way these people play the game. They just buy all the cosmetics they can just to show off. They get their share of fun from this and they could not care less about grinding game's events to get yet another piece of gear only to make this grind what?.. Faster?.. More enjoyable?.. Well, this game does not really offer many other options. Also, these people might as well not even care about storyline. So it is what it is, they just spend money on yet another set of (quite poorly designed) cosmetics, put them on/in their camp and log off for the night. This is their way of playing.
---
Nope sorry. You'll just have to wait until tomorrow.
---
Was starting to be on the up and up. But will probably hit a steady decline with new money grabbing tactics
---
NMS and battlefront 2 learnt their respective  lessons early on.  76 likes to test the waters on what it can do with earning more money
---
Campsite with Grahm and the responder vendor bot, reminiscing about how they used to have a monopoly on wandering trading in Appalachia.
---
They should also really make then more with using... like, extend the range so it covers a size of the map like almost 1/4 of it. That's the only feasible way to make it useful
---
I bought it. It's ok. Kind of frustrating because so many people bought it so it's hard to make a unique camp with it. Windowed half walls are my favorite part. I made a garden loft with those and the dirt floors. Just wish there was a plain foundation (without the porch roof) option. $12 is kind of steep but I had enough atoms to justify it.
---
Not a terrible idea actually
---
last night i found her over by the old raider camp playin chicken with the radscopions i bust in kill them an go to her "now your not gona give me trouble too are you kid" 
---
bish i just saved yer bacon from them glowin bad burrowing boys an your givin me grief?
---
Despite how much time I've put in, and how much wastelanders helped (quite a bit) I still don't think I would recommend it. There's just better ways to spend 15 bucks. In the end it still boils down to several layers of grind that get old pretty quickly.
---
I thought so but wanted to double check. Found out I need flux as well so I got stuff to do tomorrow as well!
---
Now that is a Gallery.
---
I use a .38 instigating combat rifle thats useful for most baddies and saves my .45.
---
Had a million billion shotgun shells and finally started using them with a instigating combat shotgun and am just now running low 
---
Even the bullets you think are useless just need the right gun to fire them effectively.
---
The tiny lighthouses at landview lighthouse have about 3 copper each. Not much but always good to pick up when doing the event
---
This is exactly what I do. It‚Äôs annoying but effective.
---
Does it stack with demon speed?
---
Apparently already in the ATX files but still unreleased, was featured in the same original images as the clean sink.
---
with season? what do you mean rank up? is the nw mode? I just brought the Colector and did not saw the rank up thing anywhere
---
Rank 34 is gonna be the griefer icon for sure haha
---
didnt use furniture had to lean through curtains that reached the floor the machines were set back far enough you had to move into them to get to them im now defaulting to if they have them hid or inside anything they arent getting my caps flat no negotiations im done
---
Why wouldn't the game just give you another level one copy of the card and not let you rank it?
---
Wait, you can *actually* tame animals at your camp? I thought the ‚Äúpet‚Äù deathclaws thing was a joke people used to laugh at a glitch.
---
Not a glitch. You are correct. People can buy when they're off. Either need to store the machines (which is a pain to restock when you put them back) or wall off the area and make it inaccessible to others (wall it off, don't just lock a door...people just pick the lock and don't care).
---
The same exact outfit is in there 8 times. EIGHT. That's ridiculous and lazy as hell.
---
This Is why we need bottlecap mines back.
---
I don't know how NMS makes it's money, but they are amazing, because they never asked more of it.
---
Yeah. Just started for me after I made my Gatling plasma and 50 cal both prime.
---
does it matter?\\
---
same weapons for me :/
---
ten
---
Really agree with your last paragraph. Comeback commenced--i believe so. Comeback complete? More of a 'serious but stable condition with doctors *optimistic* about a recovery'.
---
On the flip side, I hate the guy that killed my CAMP Brahmin and if I try to fight back, I run the risk of my whole CAMP being ruined.
---
well if you're not advertising on map theres a much less chance of ppl buying stuff.. unless you're in a popular spot.
---
So true, but you would have to play the game like any regular player who plays the game to know that.
---
makes me wish for half-WIDTH walls
---
This is a really cool service and idea. I don't really need any help but I do have a question. What are the plans that are generally worth the most?
---
the look of it is the reason im grinding it!
---
the only one looking better imo is the marine armor
---
Does season rewards include atoms or are those now completely money only?
---
How long it takes to complete challenges is irrelevant in this discussion since there's a finite amount of rewards. After you reach rank 100 in season you're done, nothing new will be given to you for your actions. You can rush to rank 100 in two weeks or you can reach it on the last day of 10 week season - the end result is the same, you got laughable 1350 Atoms for all your troubles and there won't be more till next season starts.
---
It looks fine to me. I like what‚Äôs offered. I just think a lot of people will always be displeased, neutral, or pleased. I just want a radiation trap with the playground.
---
Yea,  nothing but player icons and garbage... like skins for every armor set... and five weapon skins... and like nine power armor skins... and two backpacks... and a dozen or so camp items... total garbage.
---
If its not an item what is it?
---
A character that opens up the real endgame that we all have missed.
---
nine.
---
As a player nearing 1600 hours on 76, I can safely say I‚Äôm almost done with all the normal challenges, thus weekly and daily challenges are pretty much my only atom income other than Fallout 1st atoms. Weekly and Daily challenges are the reason I get on and play every day, they are the reasons me and my buddies hang out so we can do challenges. I am NOT a fan of Bethesda basically taking away our ways to get free atoms. 
---
Worst backlash I‚Äôve seen Bethesda get was when Fasnacht was delayed by a few days, yet getting our daily and weekly challenges taken away hasn‚Äôt warranted another huge backlash? People on here riot over the wrong things... don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Fasnacht. But everyone was basically threatening to cancel their FO1st subscriptions because Fasnacht was delayed, we all need to raise just as much hell to show Bethesda we aren‚Äôt okay with our daily and weekly atoms getting taken away. Pretty much anybody without FO1st is screwed without weekly and daily challenges, and that‚Äôs a real scumbag move on Bethesda‚Äôs part. Not everybody has money to spend on atoms.
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned, this is the worst thing Bethesda has done to its player base. Even worse than removing the radical mask legendary effect... How long are you going to keep punishing your player base Bethesda?
---
I got an Instigating vats chance faster reload one from the purveyor. Lots of fun to use :)
---
What?
---
8?
---
It's currently just a junk item, but it's too large to fit into any of the regular display cases üòî
---
Yes, that is how developing video games work... they require money... and live service games require a constant stream of it.
---
If everyone can hoard their thousands of free atoms every month then they have no reason to buy more atoms and the game doesn't get the money it needs.
---
7
---
Anyone worried someone will try to make a Neverland Ranch CAMP now that we have monkeys and a bunch of kiddie rides?
---
Turns out there were a few more pics in an earlier datamine, you‚Äôll need to go almost to the bottom to find them:
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/scBlqDD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Something I‚Äôd like to add, based on data mining I‚Äôve seen... Most new items are in SCORE rather than the shop. Perhaps they‚Äôre shifting to a ‚Äòfreemium‚Äô cosmetic style and P2W consumables. 
---
They retracted that statement on P2W.
---
Social Distancing Fallout style.  Gotta keep those New Plague numbers down.
---
Thats already doable via what i assume is a glitch, though its basically double budget at this point, it would definitely be nice if it could be implemented properly.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
That's the whole, fucking, point. Imagine your boss would stat paying you only $100 every month instead of whatever you're getting now. And the excuse would be that from now on the company will be sending you food, clothers and other stuff for "free". Only that you can't pick what you'll get and chances are, most of it will be the stuff you don't like or outright don't have the use for. And don't forget, you'll still be doing your job. Great, isn't it?
---
Worst cast scenario , you can buy it from foundation afterwards. No it‚Äôs not free, but you can get it while completely siding with the raiders.
---
Ya I can‚Äôt do that my budget is maxed I make fairly realistic houses lol.
---
Now, I agree with you on 99% percent of this, but for the sake of accuracy, I am required to point out that one of the Sunnys sells a white hard hat. However, I agree with everything else.
---
I just love 90% of this co.munity
---
Angry turtle does a good ammo ingredients farming video and copper is mentioned
---
We have lots of Settlers and Raiders stuff, I would like to see Enclave stuff and Zetan stuff too.
---
Skins. Wow. Can‚Äôt wait.
---
if they fix the performance and desync that would make at least 45% of older players come back and new ones to stay, I mean 5 of 10 hits don't get registered and the enemies even showing damage taken/stun or playing the stagger animation don't lose health, fixing the combat should had been fix it by now.
---
&gt;they can't just leave things as they are because it's unfair that beta players have their hoards of atoms.
---
How exactly is this unfair and to whom? Genuinely don't understand this point
---
Though this most certainly doesn‚Äôt alleviate your point, there *is* actually one new item added that one of the Sunnys sells: A white hard hat.
---
What you do is constantly juggle and fill that last 30 pounds on your character and in your box. Then you get stuff, become over encumbered, drink chems to make it to your stash, see you have no room, rage quit and start the cycle again the next time you play.
---
Sometimes when i post on this subreddit it's like im talking to a wall. I remember posting about the sharp nerf in atoms gained, and how it's another way for Bethesda to nickle and dime us. I also warned seasons are just clever ways to masking content that isn't actually content. 
---
But i got flamed and downvoted and i was told i'm jumping to conclusions. Really? After all bethesda has done to this playerbase are far as broken promises and overselling their product- people still give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
I‚Äôm taking a break from the grind to go play some Dust and Frost, it‚Äôs refreshingly unforgiving.
---
One thing that would be cool is if they brought back the institute. Maybe a random encounter can include a damaged gen 1 synth that is trying to repair himself. you either have the option to help with the repairs by spending a couple of scrap or to let him die.
---
As someone who is foggy on fallout lore, who is he and why is he so important?
---
Honestly, I play as a Brotherhood soldier and I think adding the Brotherhood faction first is just tacky. Though to be honest having them in the game in the first place feels kind of weird.  
---
I would of rather the Responders or something new but I feel like bringing the West Coast Brotherhood over to the east coast is just fan service.
---
Thanks mate
---
Yes!!! I immediately thought of the same thing!!!
---
It is because Bethesda does not like making money.
---
I bet we get brohoods stuff with upcoming brohood DLC.
---
I know you get some Enclave gear from their quest line, but I agree, we need more options.
---
The concept of a fridge in game is much desired and executed really fucking poorly though. I wouldn't consider it p2w at all. I have to pay to have my food spoil marginally slower while also taking up camp budget? What perishable foods in game are worth keeping, honestly? I agree with your first point about the ammo converter; people would be upset if it was not somehow unlockable by the masses. But comparing the utility of the ammo converter (even with its horrid exchange rates) and the fridge is a really poor example.
---
This. Entirely this. 
---
I tried, nearer to the games launch, to work on a Raider community. Probably the ONLY reason I still play is the people I met, and creating a text based RP via Discord. Ignoring some dramas from people interactions, it‚Äôs probably the main thing to keep my interest in the game, and build a bit of a community. Getting real support for things we write about and wish we could do (customization, custom factions, ACTUAL endgame content, or even custom quests) would be validating and helpful to the whole community. So long as there‚Äôs things for people who don‚Äôt fit that mold as well (IE the recent stuff about the PVP community that I hardly knew existed, more for the traders, and the lore experts).
---
So, people who can be taken advantage of easier shouldn't be on the internet, but the people (or corporations) doing everything in their power to take advantage of those people, we're okay with that?
---
What part of predatory don't you understand? Forget Bethesda for a moment and just look at the countless mobile games that rely on exploiting the psychology of people, look at casinos and gambling problems, now look at Fallout 76.
---
If your answer to predatory behaviour is to blame the victim, then man, that's some messed up ethics and morality.
---
&gt; I've used the text chat mod that's available for PC extensively and I've NEVER in all my many many months using the mod have seen anyone even attempt to roleplay. Absolutely zero character to character local chat (roleplay or otherwise).
---
I feel like that a big reason for this is that there is no local chat.
---
I agree with you to some extent that RP isn't longevity for everyone, but that certainly doesn't mean it doesn't have a place in F76. Text chat is important in multiplayer games nowadays and it's a shame Bethesda has been dragging their feet on it.
---
Have it on my vendor for 5K caps. No one buy it
---
A settler/raider/scavenger wounded or "crop dusted" by a Scorched.  Have the option of saving them with a vaccine or letting them turn.  Can force them to join faction, charge them caps, enslave them, or simply give it away for free.  Throw in forcing a choice to pick who gets saved if you don't have enough for multiple NPC's.
---
Yea, who wants shit like skins and camp items when I could instead be saving up atoms so I can buy skins and camp items.
---
I think its all random, but you could at least preserve the ones that you do find by using a refrigerated backpack or the Good With Salt perk rank 3.  They should last for hours and hours.
---
This, this, a thousand times this. It doesn't matter how many power armors they add at this point. I've bought a few and I'm not buying any more; I can only use one at a time so what's the point? Especially when you consider the state of power armor in game, but that's another conversation...
---
Why would you want less freedom to choose what you want?
---
On pc?
---
And don‚Äôt forget too look for the slug busterü§ô
---
What platform you on
---
I want Grahm and chally the moo moo as allies.
---
We need like an enclave symbol we can place in.our camp. Instead of creating our own with the letterings. Stuff like this would indeed be welcome
---
IGN Tzahi
---
Wish to see what I miss
---
PC, you?
---
Steam numbers don't represent the full base of players. You still have all the players using the Bethesda launcher. Then there's both PS4 and Xbox players.
---
I agree! If memory servers, and it usually doesn't, fallout 4 had a flag you could put up. I would like that
---
I wouldn't consider 3 quests that take about 5 minutes each and doing 3-5 public events grinding but okay.
---
I'll buy if xbox
---
There is local chat with the mod. Just no one uses it, or very very rarely. Like I mentioned, I've seen zero people locally.
---
I'm not against having text chat in the game. It's just the reasons that people give to justify having text that (mostly character to character chat as direct replacement for voice chat) is BS. That's not what people actually use text chat for.
---
Where do you think Watoga gets the money for all those bots we kill?
---
I have the Elder paint they should automatically recognize my standing.
---
I‚Äôve got a JE combat rifle if you‚Äôre looking for crowd control.
---
Mr house is the founder of robco and in new vegas well sort of the king pin
---
Fusion cells, Plasma cores, Plasma cartridges, Shishkebobs, plasma weapon repairs, various CAMP items.
---
Hello, you are probably new to the game based on your description. Few things, there is a Reddit called r/market76 where you can trade your items. Two, The AA prefix is not even close to being as valuable as bloodied so finding a trade like that would be hard.
---
My heavy gunner is what I call The Outcast (fo3 sound familiar?) Cept enclave version. Plan to get a thorn set, and have a freestates backpack ghille suit hood + vault 94 scout mask. 
---
Built a whole character story relating to free states/enclave/vault 94 events.
---
I am the true Outcast üòÅ
---
That's awesome!!! I really liked the outcast and that's really cool you've brought it into fallout 76.
---
Ahh, you‚Äôre the guy wants these GnB5s I have...
---
To start off, what type of melee build are you going for? Unarmed, one-handed, or two-handed?
---
yup :)
---
A fireproof chest piece of any description. Plus Fireproof. Scorchbeasts are no longer a problem until you get right up in its face so it can smack you one.
---
Shotgunner perks (I just run one rank of each one), Skeet Shooter, all the normal damage boost ones.  I am bloodied so it benefits from Adrenal reaction, adrenaline, nerd rage, etc.  Sneak works pretty well with it.
---
Depending on your build, roll for whatever suits you.  Add Extended barrel, Aligned stock, short scope, Prime or Hardened receiver, and the Perforating magazine.  Profit.  It will miss most first shots in VATS, but if you have gun fu, it will hit all the switched targets.  I do better aiming for headshots for whatever reason.  In third person, it will rapid fire.  Does good damage to everything including the queen if she touches the ground.
---
Wait...daily challenges to earn atoms are gone?
---
Or a standard 9 iron. It works for both.
---
Hi :) see proof
---
i would if i came across that
---
I don't think I've done the unsolved death and taxedermies quest. I'll do it and get the plan for you cause I have nothing to do.
---
Just kinda changed it.from a bos outcast to enclave. Thats what fallout 76 enclave quests made me.feel like. I joined em (Modus) but I am my own president kinda fitting considering us (76'er) is like a legend to the settlers/raiders (or returning factions/npcs)
---
Bethesda is going to put this piece of equipment into our hands and then make us grind for upgrades to make it actually useful.
---
Vaultec: Democracry*. *Democracy not guaranteed*.
---
It may already be compatible?  Are u sure that it isn‚Äôt?
---
Reskins and recolors for free rewards, classic sleazy Bethesda move. Also it's so disingenuous of them to have released the captain cosmos skin in the shop right before the pass comes out.
---
Dam that house is so cheap! I just bought an apartment of 45m2 and it was the same price, maybe I should move...
---
Because I value the long term stability of the game over my own greed and having some stuff I wouldn't have bought unlocked alongside a bunch of stuff I definitely would have bought seems like a fair trade if it means the game is less saturated with free  atoms and more people are actually buying them and we all have to worry a bit less about whether or not Bethesda is going to get desperate enough to start selling loot boxes and shit?
---
Lol glad to hear I'm not the only one does that.
---
Didn‚Äôt know there was three lol, but one handed I think
---
Except calling the fridge P2W was all people fucking talked about when it first came out.  It was Bethesda's descent into breaking their eternal promise and the next rational step would obviously be loot boxes.
---
Might have been part of the cut presidential questline. Or just flavor that they can use in the future, there are tons of things in the world that they can choose to flesh out. Look at all the preexisting structures/areas that wastelanders used.
---
Ah, then it is safe to say you simply did not read my post or that you misunderstood it. Alrighty then.
---
Make sure you know which one you want to roll with. One handed weapons are hatchets, all the knives, machetes, etc
---
It sounds like you'd say Bethesda is greedy....
---
I'm not saying it's unfair, I'm saying  that's the argument other people are making.  That people who have been playing the game longer have a stockpile of atoms so it would be unfair if new players don't have the same opportunity to stockpile atoms the same way.
---
Not to you.
---
That's an entirely different point. 
---
You see my boss. Pays me to perform a job. We have an agreement ahead of time: I do x job. You pay me Y amount. That's the agreement. 
---
In this instance it's a game company saying "Here's some free stuff, of which we have zero obligation to provide to you, again, for free."
---
Then they altered the free stuff which, again, they have zero obligation to provide you....
---
I don't think you understand the difference between jobs.... And playing video games.
---
For perks, you‚Äôll want the gladiator, expert and master, and low health or high?
---
That does make sense. I was hoping for more enclave quest, but once you finish launching the nuke, that's it. :(
---
i've always wanted to see who the heck is always restocking the Nuka Cola machines. figured there must be a Nuka Man wandering the wastes filling the machines, and one of these days i'd like to meet them.
---
Well, they think under 200. Probably closer to 150-180.
---
However, are you honestly surprised that Bethesda would resort to such manipulative tactics to try and push people into spending money so they don't miss out.
---
It's a real scumbag way to do business but this is Bethesda for you.
---
Sorry?
---
We're talking about an entirely optional premium currency... And you're getting some free.... And people are complaining about it..... Of which they had no obligation to give you, for free..... and people are complaining....
---
I bought two serums of Marsupial. I thought it would only be temp and I though why not activate starched genes. Still have it so every time I see a serum I buy it up. Can you have multiple mutations?
---
Either rotate them or move closer/further away from the edge where the wall clips and it should flip around.
---
You should be able to pick it in lvl up under strength. If not file a ticket with Bethesda and God speed
---
I've never seen a "serious" roleplayer in all my time either. I've had people run at me naked with pitchforks before but that's about it. 
---
Even if you try to faction roleplay, you're constantly reminded that you're a vault dweller. You technically don't join any of the factions you do work for, Wastelanders NPCs call you a dweller, and even getting max rep just makes you an ally.
---
Idk. Hence this post
---
For starting, the two women outside the vault give you a machete. My mistress character, did one hand melee and pistols. My favorite (I was high health) was the gutter (from the burrows) essentially a vampire's assaultron blade. I prefer one handed, because they're typically faster. However, if you're going bloodied, deathclaw gauntlet is the best. Two hands, I guess a war drum.
---
Happened to me too had to restart the game
---
Yeah, lol
---
you only really get the under armor and the officers outfit which is really sad because of how important modus and the bunker is to the main story
---
High health
---
&gt;Fallout 76 desperately needs a method of communication in text form and this feature is essential to giving the Roleplaying community a structurally sound backbone. 
---
how is that false? maybe roleplayers don't know of its existence or they don't see any other roleplayers using it, so they don't use it either. text chat is basically mandatory if you want to RP and a mod that not everyone uses isn't really good enough.
---
S I X
---
Oh. Thank you for the answer.
---
[We needed this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Race_for_the_Presidency) and I'd feel like the appalachian chapter of the enclave quests could become a little more complete. Cuz like Eckhart was "potus" via a rigged election system so he could gather control of the defcon system. I want that title now please and presidental camo skins for PA + gauss rifle please and thank you. 
---
This quest would also give the pvpers little cause for rally for that dwindling crew since the event is pvp oriented. I dont like pvp but I could just trigger the event in a private server where no other players to vote against my presidency üòàüòà
---
Just go on the roof of Wes tek. They're not rare
---
I hate doing the dumb challenges and love the regular grinding, so I‚Äôm likely to get more from this really.
---
(Maybe not since I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù do 2 challenges/day)
---
No problem
---
I wish I found vendors like you on Xbox :/
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
For your melee martial artist you should look into . I believe that gives you faster swing speed. Alright, so I don‚Äôt know much perks that affect high health, but for armor you should run vanguards, which gives you 35+ energy and damage resistance, I have all five pieces fully upgraded and could give you well over 400-500 damage resistance.
---
I completely agree! I always loved the way their power armor look. And unless I'm missing something, it's not available in fo76
---
you can just go pick one up at wes tek roof
---
paying for location not build quality lol
---
I‚Äôve been using the machete and it does feel very nice :). Thank you!
---
Planning to rig an election?!??? Sounds like you're half way there!
---
You cannot, since it was made into a public event.
---
Well aside from the people that are aware of it (I'm sure that there are some RP people that are aware of it given that's it's not a secret that the chat mod exists), you also have voice chat currently in the game.
---
Likewise, have not seen voice chat ever used in game to roleplay a character.
---
Well, with exactly one exception which was the dude in the very very early days that RPed as Preston Garvey. Other than that dude, never seen anyone RP in voice chat.
---
Okay I‚Äôll start to try and collect some early or save the script at least :). Thank you so much for this adobe it helps clarify a lot!
---
No problem! I hope you have a good day and find some good legendaries!
---
Not worth the time you're going to put into it?  Otherwise known as playing the game?
---
**five**
---
I just.want that presidental "power" suit. +3 cha as an appearl and im assuming.its like presidental like üòâüòâ so itd look real cool for us enclave fans out there. But I digress
---
I do not like this new system coming up, Weekly and Daily challenges are the only atom income I have since I‚Äôve basically finished all the normal challenges. 
---
Only way 1500 atoms every 3 months is going to work is if atomic shop prices go way, and I mean WAY the Hell down, like 25% of what they usually are. (300 for a pack instead of 1200. 1500 atoms isn‚Äôt even enough to get a PA skin, this new system is absurd.) 
---
Or

They add more normal challenges that repeat when you beat them. Like the Character, Survival, Combat, Social, and World Challenges. I just recently killed the 16k robots to finish all the robot challenges, if they were to add a few repeatable challenges like ‚ÄúKill 1000 Blood Eagles/Robots/Animals/Creatures/Scorched/etc.‚Äù for 40 atoms each, then I‚Äôd be okay with Daily and Weekly challenges being removed. (I‚Äôd love a repeatable 40 atom challenge for killing 1000 Blood Eagles, that would give me a reason to assault all their camps around the map, unlike most other stuff the Blood Eagles are actually challenging and fun to fight.)
---
I‚Äôd pay 10k caps or 5k caps and 5k ammo...
---
The pie itself is dissipatingly useless so I'd say you got the better trade
---
Nobody uses the text chat mod because nobody uses it... People are also extremely wary of using any sort of mod in general due to fears of being banned, even if they're unsubstantiated. On-top of that, the Text chat mod isn't exactly 'feature complete' or working seamlessly within the game. And pal, I have to dispute you based on every single MMO with an RP community out there - It might not be what 'you' use it for. But people looking to RP? Use the shit out of it in games where it's supported. SWTOR, WoW, ESO, etc, etc, etc -   
---
' For the rest of us, it's a steady flow of engaging content, however that is manifest. '   
---
( Like Roleplay? )
---
Thank you so much, that‚Äôs really kind of you
---
You haven't seen it because the game doesn't have the facilities to support it.
---
Some of us have done nearly everything already and the only thing left to do is complete collections and do challenges. The game just isn‚Äôt exciting end game and I was really hoping the season pass would change that   With a combination of interesting challenges and rewards, you‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion but for the amount of time they‚Äôve said we‚Äôre going to have to put in per rank the rewards aren‚Äôt worth it
---
Did you mean the [Hellfire paint](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hellfire_prototype) armour from NW? Its a grind to get forsure but they atleast gave us it (prototype to fit lore lool)
---
This guy nailed it :D
---
voice chat is broken for me most of the time, i tried all the suggested fixes and it's still way too quiet, i don't doubt others have the same issue with it given that these bugs have been around since launch, i also barely see anyone use it *at all*, i could count on 2 hands the amount of times someone has spoken in 200 hours of playtime and that number is even smaller if i don't count some people who spoke on more than one occasion.
---
one of the two we have is very  buggy and inconsistent and the other is a mod which people might not know about or don't want to download for whatever reason, neither is a sufficient substitute for properly implemented text chat
---
It's the June update because.... drum roll please!  It's coming out while it's still June!
---
They release patches on Tuesdays at the same time they do server maintenance.  If Tuesday were July 1st then they'd call it the fucking July update... because it would then be July.
---
Seriously, how fucking desperate are people to look for conspiracies or something to bitch about that we're picking apart the mystery behind why an update that comes out on June 30th is called a June update?
---
Got it:) what's your GT? I'll join you and drop it for you
---
you can have multiple mutations: i'm currently mutated as both marsupial and healing factor. but if what you're getting at is could you have, say double marsupial, i'm pretty sure you can't.
---
Don't forget incisor for some armour penatration too.
---
the lighting system rework evidently was not finished as the lighting on the contemporary floors as well as some other things is broken.
---
Belviathan, same as on here. Feel free to look through my vending machines and I‚Äôll let you pick out something you want for free
---
I'm kind of doing my own thing. I'm doing stealth pipe gun spec for more immersion, and focusing on kill streaks and second wind damage boosts for a play style similar to the Psycho in Borderlands 2. I'm also testing a high energy resist build utilizing lv 1 leathers, perks, and mutations. I'd love any advice involving damage mitigation or if anybody knows if weapon weight reduction effect even applies to lv 1 armor cause I've never seen it.
---
Trading is against rule 10. Head over to the market sub.
---
Finally good news
---
It's a fucking season pass meant to replace daily and weekly challenges... ie the kind of shit that was already easy to do and needs to be so because ALL players from fresh out of the vault newbies to veterans need to be able to do them.  If you were expecting a new endgame experience out of an alternative to daily challenges then you were looking in the wrong fucking place.  The odds of seeing anything like that before the off map expeditions come out is slim to none.
---
Joining now:) I'll check out your vendors, but I don't need anything for free. I just like helping out

It was a blast zone, but when the blast zone times out the flora can stay irradiated
---
If the flora was irradiated the blast zone may have recently dissipated. Not sure whether the colossus can spawn before it dissipates and survive after or if it's a true bug....
---
i don't doubt that they were intending to make the later seasons have a fee attached and only changed their minds once they saw how much fuss was being kicked up when players *thought* that was the case, it would explain why they took so long to announce that all seasons would be free, rather than nip it in the bud immediately.
---
That's not a bug, they have a small chance to show up replacing a random encounter in a blast zone, you just happened to stumble upon one right after the rads timed out.
---
Yes, thank you!
---
I can respect that, thanks so much!
---
What are 2 Utility Items?
---
I thought they weren‚Äôt in the game yet and are only in the PC exclusive test servers?
---
Depends on who you ask.  If you ask the salty people you'll have to fork over hundreds of dollars to unlock everything, ask anyone else and you have to do something as outrageous as "playing the game".
---
Please tell me you're on PS4. I want it so bad üò≠

Ammo converter and Chicken Coop
---
does the distinction really matter if bethesda is staying with zenimax? people tried to push the blame for destiny 2 onto activision only to be proven wrong when bungie actually got *worse* after leaving activision, who is to say that bethesda aren't equally to blame or even more so than zenimax? or that they are not essentially the same company following the same rules and so blaming one is like blaming the other?
---
We don't really know for certain but given it took Bethesda 3 weeks to make that clarification, it doesn't look good for them.
---
Tank you
---
Sometimes they drop pre-modded though...or at least for me I've found some with mods already on them.
---
Nope, they've been in since wastelanders. The spawn rate is just low.
---
They've been in game for awhile, have like a 1/15th spawn chance in certain areas (that have been nuked)
---
Welp now I feel silly, guess I should of done my research first
---
Yeah the 36 crafts suck it‚Äôs like 200/300 ammo just to clear a max level west tek. I do see your point though. Kinda a shame you lose 45% ammo pen for use if them out of pa if it wasn‚Äôt for that I‚Äôd be heavy all the way.
---
PC? Did you do the changing default communication device setting to match your speakers and also switch off the setting that reduces your speaker volume when in a call? That normally fixes it for most people.
---
I agree that neither situation is a good substitute for in-game chat. All I'm saying is based on the existing methods we have, roleplaying isn't a thing. Certainly not as big of a thing people make it out to be.
---
Zenimax has owned Bethesda since 1999. There is no difference between the two.
---
Well while your here you wanna crack a trade?
---
That‚Äôs right, don‚Äôt respond you fucking nigger
---
You are correct on all points.  As for the odds, IMO you have better odds for unyielding if you craft at high health, vanguards if you craft at low health.  I guess it is sort of an additional FU from Bethesda's RNG.  Maybe it is just a myth, but I find it to be true in my experiences.  You'll need about 30 rolls per piece on average to get one that you can live with.  Sometimes you might get the right piece in 10 rolls, other times you might need 50.  I rolled 140 left legs before I got an unyielding one that I liked, but that is admittedly the worst possible case.
---
Good luck, may the RNG gods smile upon you.
---
Considering it takes so much dedication (one to two hours for each rank) then I am severely unimpressed.  Especially sad for the atoms earned reduction, but this is Zenimax/Bethesda we're talking about, look what they did to ESO. Consider yourselves lucky we don't get loot boxes.
---
I think you under estimate how much they make bud. They aren‚Äôt hurtin for cash. Everything they do pisses off more and more people though, and that‚Äôs not good for business.
---
Wrong
---
Omg not on here aswell ffs we know already
---
Yea but a lot of people already buy atoms as is so it's kind of a swing and a miss. Bean counters keep ignoring the fact you can more for lower prices and always go for the highest possible cost as is. Free atoms are about the only way I'm getting any of the atomic shop goods even with my first membership, which is feeling more and more like a rip off but that's another topic entirely. Everything is already overpriced as is even with their pseudo-sales to cause people to impulse buy things. They aren't bleeding money due to the atomic shop, if they are in desperate need of income from it it's due to the player base getting tired of constant crashes, netcoding rubberbanding like crazy not being able to see you friends on your list or have them join you on your private server due to them not being friends when they are. There are many more things that might make it be less financially viable than just free atoms.
---
If you've ever done any sort of RP you know that voice chat is nowhere near ideal. You have varying quality levels when it comes to microphones, you have people bleeding into eachother and talking over-one another, you have all sorts of background noise and game audio. You've also got gib little ten year old Joey trying to pretend he's a big gruff Sheepsquatch hunter and getting laughed out of the call.   
---
You can make do with it if you're desperate, but that's the whole point. Looking for a better, more convenient and more accessible option.
---
You're deluded to think that player to player roleplaying will sustain the game. Not RP in the sense of you dealing with NPCs. That's different but that's not what we're talking about, just to nip that strawman in the bud.
---
Even to allude that it's comparable to gameplay content like raids, bosses, or the like is laughable on the face of it.
---
I'm not saying people don't RP and you don't have RP communities or even whole RP servers for other online game. I'm just saying it's so rare with this current game, even with voice chat fully available to all players be default, that it's really not a strong argument to say we need text chat because of roleplaying.
---
It's self-evidently nonsensical. How people use the PC text chat mod proves it. Same too with how people use voice chat.
---
Sorry bud. Roleplaying isn't that big of a thing in Fallout 76. Certainly not to hang its hook on to justify having text chat. Not to say that we shouldn't have text chat. It's just that roleplaying is a poor reason for it. Catering to deaf people, to people who don't have a mic, to people who have poor english spoken skills or have more anxiety speaking english than typing it are all superior reasons for having text chat implemented over roleplaying.
---
Damn rip, thank you for the info though!
---
I yoinked that thing. Is it any good? I kept it because it seemed cool.
---
That's the whole point, Roleplaying isn't a thing because there aren't sufficient tools in place to make it work with. And it is a thing, even then - There are people trying despite it all to kick things off, Doc CJ Martin is a famous story of a 76 RP'er doing what he can with what he has - But it's not enough for the vast majority of people that would be interested in RP.
---
It‚Äôs been listed as owned for the longest time, so I don‚Äôt remember. Even that comment you‚Äôre responding to is 42 days old. Do wish I had a forehead smudge though, I think was the intended take away.
---
I don‚Äôt get it either.
---
I started with an axe, then a vampire machete, death tambo, cultist dagger, then Vampire switchblade.
---
The vampire switchblade has been my primary for about 150 levels,  Recently supplanted by an FSS ghoul slayers switchblade - great for WS runs,
---
Have a few others in my inventory for fun, but keep going back to the vanpire...combined with healing factor, and because you do take a lot of hits, bolstering armor,
---
keep a couple heavy weapons for cargobots and Other things that fly,,,,ot PITA ground based critters
---
Can‚Äôt know for certain until the update, but ‚ÄúCombat Rifle‚Äù being in its title is concerning. Plus, as another person pointed out, past combat rifle skins have not had this feature
---
I think I know exactly how much they're making off of people like myself, and that is a big whopping zero dollars.  I have almost 27000 atoms in the bank and if things just continued as they have been that number would only keep growing and I would never have any reason to spend a single penny on this game again.  That's a fucking problem.
---

The searing/puncturing/rocket baseball bat is about the best possible melee weapon you can use at level 1.

You will want slugger perks with it.  And martial artist.

Any high level player should be able to craft you one.
---
It‚Äôs been 2 years, they‚Äôre constantly developing.
---
Good i have enough useless atoms saved up from the fallout first membership which i never have felt a need to spend them on all the useless stuff, but as far as i saw all of the rewards there are useless too so i will just save up even more until my yearly membership runs out üòÇ
---
Fisto smh üòí lol
---
Nope. The only bloodied heavys I have are god rolls. And I don't run aa heavys. Specially not on a gattling laser, aa is kinda pointless on heavys since you have stabilzed. And double so on an energy weapon since they still havnt properly fixed it
---
Im always intrigued by bloodied, but not sure if it really fits my playstyle. I also think it's complete overkill, I mean I pretty much one shot everything in the game with a junkies build, so why do I really ned more damage ya know? Are you not pretty vulnerable with low health getting so close to enemies with unarmed?
---
1 - RP Communities sustain many MMOs, they're not the biggest but they're a sizeable chunk of dedicated, self-serving players that routinely can be counted on to continue supporting games in the absence of official content. That's the whole point of the post.   
---
2 - How about people that don't have microphones and can only communicate via emotes? Is that enough of a reason? What are your reasons for not having it, exactly?   
---
3 - For the hundredth time, the PC text chat mod isn't officially supported or feature complete. It's also underpopulated and difficult to coordinate from the ground up. You need infrastructure already there to pull that off and most RPers can't be assed building that infrastructure because the game isn't made for it.  
---
4 - It's not a big thing in 76 because 76 makes doing it a pain. That's the whole point of adding all these extra systems to make RP more accessible in 76, to give RP a chance to take hold in 76.

With the trio of dodgy, blocker and serendipity, plus lone wanderer, you can eat a few hits before being in real trouble.  Maxing our stealth ability plus an unyielding suit keeps you very sneaky, so being spotted doesn‚Äôt happen very often.  I also have a couple cavalier armor effects that help me take even less damage while either sprinting towards enemies when I‚Äôm seen, or running for cover to reacquire stealth.
---
As far as damage, it‚Äôs pretty satisfying to kill the Sheepsquatch Impostor in 3-4 hits, or one with a bunch of food buffs and Nuka shine.
---
Crane caught Pie &gt;b25/25 fixer
---
Happened to me several times at Encryptid. Adding insult to injury, after waiting 5 minutes or so to respawn, the Sheepsquatch-bot body and loot were gone. FFS please fix this, Bethesda.
---
What inspired this post? Have I missed something.
---
I did the exact same thing! Also I just recently updated some of mine with new outfits from wastelanders.
---
Dude, who has that kind of time?! I've been saving up atoms for nuka cola themed items. Don't temp me, Bethesda, into spending them on Tuesday!
---
I had modules left from the Vault 94 raid grind.  At 4 a day, you can get them in about 5 weeks.  IKR, damn the grind.  I think Bethesda designed it to take at least a month to get a full set of SS.
---
if u seek revenge it means the player will be an enemy (red) next time u respawn
---
People are triggered by the Atom nerf in regards to the seasons.
---
I have no idea what that means. What are seasons?
---
Yes!!! This please!!! The fixer had been out long enough that most people have one, even if they don‚Äôt use it. Pls add it to the fixerüôåüèª
---
in my vendor
---
Basically a new way to grind and earn cosmetics in the game. Daily and weekly requirements, and rewards for completing. They begin on the 30th.
---
With the addition many ways to earn existing atoms have been reduced, so as to force people into their wallets a little more often if they want to clear the weekly requirements and also still buy things from the atom shop.
---
He's trying to stir shit up because people are complaining that they reduced the roughly 5k atoms we could make in a 3 month period down to 1500 over a long grind.
---
Definitly! It's helped me escape the clutches of trap bases many times
---
Nope, it was specifically taken out of Update 20 coming on the 30th.  Legendary Perks were dead on arrival and require a major rework.  The new boss fight, A Colossal Problem, requires more polish.  Hopefully they'll get targeted for Update 21.
---
Surely that much atoms is with fallout 1st?
---
I average around 3k but buy stuff semi regularly
---
There is a BoS teaser quest that was datamined from PTS that hopefully will be activated post-U20 so that'll give us a bit of new "content" that will whet our appetites for the real content coming in the Fall and beyond.
---
There's also 2 components to the BoS quests so we won't have to wait ultimately until Feb; we should get something in the Fall time frame around the same time as Season 2 starts.
---
It's a little extreme, it shouldn't take THAT long.
---
I like the idea of it taking longer because in games like Red Dead Redemption 2, completing the pass is way too easy and doesn't take long. It's not fun when you blow through content and when you're done it's like what the fuck do I do now.
---
Making it take THAT long is definitely not the answer.
---
thats one radiated beaver
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, as it is the truth. Been there since the start. Asshole usually gives me a damn worthless G.A.S. certificate. Seen him at least 100 times now......I play a lot.
---
the dialogue window won't open for me
---
Gotta catch them all!
---
Stirring up shit is the people that are calling the seasons update the death of the game and the last straw before they go play something else.  I'm doing the exact opposite, trying to point out that people that likely haven't spent a dime on this game since they bought it probably shouldn't be complaining that they might actually have to start supporting it for once if they really want to do something as important as running around in a fancy new power armor skin.
---
I know it's obnoxious to have to quote myself but it looks like you need it because you obviously didn't read what I wrote.
---
&gt; Not to say that we shouldn't have text chat. It's just that roleplaying is a poor reason for it. Catering to deaf people, to people who don't have a mic, to people who have poor english spoken skills or have more anxiety speaking english than typing it are all superior reasons for having text chat implemented over roleplaying.

Having read several of your responses in this thread I think that this is the one that feels most appropriate to ask this question of:  it feels obvious to me that your criticism is that this is an immersion breaking system because you do arbitrary challenges to acquire items from what may or may not essentially be the cash shop, a meta system. 
---
My question is what specifically makes that so different from the current game where you do challenges to earn atoms to make purchases on the cash shop that suddenly makes this game-breaking for you?
---
Cause it‚Äôs not the game that‚Äôs the problem - yes, there are problems within but all of the issue root back to one simply source: Bethesda itself. They are too greedy, possibly lazy, and stubborn to actually do what it takes to turn a potential good game into a great online game but at every turn they lock things behind paywalls or take away free options like making repair kits then charging us for them, not fulfilling FO 1st promises, and etc. There is a fundamental flaw somewhere at Bethesda, though I wouldn‚Äôt place that blame on Pete Hines or Todd Howard or even the dev team (tho it would help if they actually played the game themselves so they can see the issues and bugs) but either way it needs to be found and done away with. Most of my friends believe it to be Zenimax‚Äôs presence at Bethesda which is kinda like EA‚Äôs presence with their studios, and their foremost concern is money, not the community.
---
Which stealthboy path is this? I'm interested
---
Twice they‚Äôve focused on possible monetization over new content and both times backlash.  Wish the community would just learn that this game could be improving wayyyy faster
---
Take time off the game. 
---
The only thing I do now is farming dailies and events for rare outfits and plans. That‚Äôs less than one hour of game time for me. It‚Äôs totally ok.
---
Nope that's just savings from challenges, and not even as much as I could possibly have since I didn't give a shit about the atom shop for the first half a year or so and rarely if ever completed any daily or weekly challenges on purpose.  
---
Frugal spending, avoiding expensive trap items like PA skins and waiting for things to return on sale to get the discounts.
---
At least EA can put out somewhat acceptable games (Minus Bio-Ware and BF5)
---
Without 1st subs and atom purchases the game's as good as dead. It doesn't have the sales in terms of core game to sustain itself and expand, especially given the incessant shit dumping it receives on social media and in online reviews.
---
If by some magic miracle I took control of any area of Bethesda, it'd be the ATX. The CAMP building cosmetic side still has a strong appeal from what I've seen and read. A solid, concerted push of worthwhile skins alone (imagine if I offered respectable reskins for *all* the weapons?) could help this product. The fact people still have 27k atoms means they've got Christ-like levels of restraint, or simply the products available weren't appealing enough.
---
But yes OP- the subs and atoms are the lifeblood but the business also needs to earn it. Fine balance. 
---
God bless you all in the Wasteland, may your rolls be godlike.
---
Nice pictures man :)
---
Well you may be tempted, but you cannot purchase levels until 2 weeks after the season starts. So you're safe at least for this coming Tuesday.
---
I think people forget sometimes that the game needs money coming in to run. It's a live service game. People are quick to shout the money grabbing shit but not realise that without it the game would cease to exist. But Bethesda bad right?
---
They are thankfully coming around but ultimately a few good games do not redeem them over major flaws and issues such as the starting fallout with Battlefront 2 which almost lost them their Star Wars IP. But EA having issues isn‚Äôt the point. Money is ultimately the only thing that matters to big company exes, that cannot be disputed. The only time when the priority changes is when some issue has result in the potential loss of future profit but a major margin such as Disney coming down on EA for those same Battlefront 2 issues. Bethesda is gonna keep doing this to the fo76 community because ultimately we recommend the game to friends and pass it off as ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù and every new player means a new bought game and more potential atom shop sales. Thus why change what they are doing. Plus there is oddly a weird portion of the community that wants to defend Bethesda in all this for whatever reason
---
Tbh I‚Äôm glad that this may have some effect on the community.  I haven‚Äôt given BGS any of my money since launch and don‚Äôt plan to.  
---
And if we go months without any actual content I‚Äôm glad to stop playing the game for a while, and I feel like potentially a lot of people feel the same.
---
You can't. Bethesda was regular cash money for it. Not have some scrub earn their 1st for free in-game.
---
It gives you atoms.
---
One tiny silver lining in this (for me exclusively) no longer having to eat up hours of my time completing daily and weekly atom challenges.
---
If they want to go ahead with removing those challenges, they better nerf the atom shop prices.
---
Don't knock specialized weapons like GS/MS/T/ or Z. Sure they aren't practical for every encounter but I have a T/E/FR Handmade that makes silo runs or runs to Sugar Grove a breeze. They are good little weapons for what they are.
---
I mean I buy it every month but I feel like they should give u a chance to earn it to and yea it does give u atoms so it‚Äôs be unfair if u just constantly re purchased it with the atoms it gives u but like say u don‚Äôt have the money one month it‚Äôd be nice to use the money u already spend on atoms
---
for a "story" as short, bland and uninspired as wastelanders, they must not have been getting a lot of atom purchases.
---
Personally I wouldn't use any of them the TS spread is obscene the instigating may be your best best out of all those rolls and the ffr is pointless.
---
Umm... dude. This is the second post today about exactly the same topic.
---
You didn't get any traction with the last post. Why would you expect any different this time around?
---
Also, easy with the "Won't anyone think of Bethesda's revenue? WHY WON'T ANYONE THING OF BETHESDA'S REVENUE?" posts.
---
Bethesda is a big boy now. They can make money on their own without your help.
---
I don‚Äôt want to support the game regardless of what happens to it.  I mean, unless there is some sort of complete graphical, gameplay, and technical overhaul.  
---
I haven‚Äôt spent a dime since launch on the game and I don‚Äôt intend to, because this isn‚Äôt a good game in my
---
opinion.  Nearly 3 years after fallout 4 and nearly no improvement.
---
Redesigning one's camp repeatedly. Trying out different looks. For a few of us, that's a pretty significant portion of enjoyment we get out of the game. I like the occasional reference to it being 'Barbie's Dream House' as an insult because...honestly it's just funny?
---
In the Sims I stop having fun the moment my characters have made enough money and I can't figure out how to redo my house anymore.
---
...I am in the wrong profession I should be doing this building shit in real life.
---
That looks amazing!
---
Phew, that's good to hear. Ha
---
There is a total of 1,680 hours in teen weeks time. 1,460 hours should be plenty of time in those ten weeks to live your life outside of the video game. 
---
Assuming that you sleep and work an exact 8 hours for both every single day during the 10 weeks, that equals 1,120 hours. Which leaves 340 hours outside of work, sleep, and fallout to eat, relax, piss, shit, shower, socialize, etc. 
---
 If you can average about 3 hours per day, then you will manage to hit level 100 by seasons end. With Covid, most people now find themselves with more free time than ever. 200 hours in 10 weeks really isn't that bad. I'm married to a wife who dislikes video games and we have a newborn, and I also have a full time job. If I can manage it, anyone can.
---
I use to do them daily. In fact that was all I was able to do due to time constraints. This week I have been sick and playing another game. Don‚Äôt really miss that daily atom grind. 
---
If the challenges are better then ‚ÄúDestroy 5 Turrets‚Äù or camp building I will be happy. I would just claim workshops and build there, since I am already at my limit. 
---
Also the leveling up while... daily was just bad. Trying to level past 100 while wearing a clown outfit, with a disease, on meds, etc. Sometimes I would just hop to an event, put my power armor on, and level up 2/3.
---
I‚Äôd say take a break and wait for new content.  But seeing BGS‚Äôs track record it could be a good while..
---
I can agree with the gameplay and technical overhaul but graphics wise I‚Äôm actually fairly okay with - guess I‚Äôve gotten used to it. But I only recently got into this game because I lost confidence in it while it was being announced, specifically the info drop on nukes and pvp had lost me and then right when the no npcs thing dropped i knew it would be dead on arrival and tried to tell my friends and strangers online and no one believed me until they saw it upon release. But I actually just beat the main story and launched my first nuke a couple days ago. But overall my experience was enjoyable, it had its negative moments like the tedious quests and previously mentioned lack of gameplay but in the end there is still potential here. And I truly want it to become the next No Man‚Äôs Sky - from lies to better than promised, but as long as they isn‚Äôt immediate, media covered outlash against Bethesda then I don‚Äôt expect anything to change, not with 76 or the next fallout and es games.

Awesome shots! Do you just hang around a place until the weather is nice?

I've been making a collection of all the funny and sometimes scary bear and other tableaux I find around. Can't always get good lighting though.
---
Bass.
---
Apparently they haven‚Äôt pissed off enough people yet.
---
Where can we check the score rewards?
---
You want a magic one with any 1 of ty he below properties. Use vats and then it will deal incredible damage.
---
I have a quad, 33% vats hit and I can 1 shot most enemies.
---
Junkies, instigating, stalkers, 50% limb damage, 40% bash, 33% vats chance.
---
This is fine for regular guns but it's not how shotguns work.
---
Think you need to check your info.
---
Being here from launch, being honest.  Don‚Äôt expect this to be the next No Mans Sky. The story behind that game was completely different, and the studio behind that took a list of everything they wanted added to the game and made it in just a couple years.   
---
Fallout 76 has been out for nearly 2 years now and we‚Äôve only had 2-3 major content updates, which in reality didn‚Äôt add much.  Just don‚Äôt get your hopes up.
---
In addition, I‚Äôve played enough since launch to have two level 111 characters and honestly the game is boring and stale past the first play through.  I‚Äôve been playing as a completionist (I also have nothing else to do) and even then nothing after the new Wastelanders story is remotely enjoyable.  
---
Truly, I wouldn‚Äôt even call this studio for this game remotely close to AAA, as games like Apex have their own dedicated studio which can push out much better, polished content in way less time than the one for this game.
---
They could follow the ESO model and open up news zones and quest lines. For all the knock on ESO, at least there is new content and in game items. Although they are not free and require the DLCs or a membership/DLC to access.
---
Beth has to pay some bills, so we are all her sugar daddies.
---
That is why they can get extra money from you because you have a job :P
---
Happy birthday to you as well
---
Nope, they have bugged effects, have a look here. Even better got test it yourself or research it.

If you follow the rail back towards Foundation, there is a cliff with two trees that have fallen onto the rail allowing you to walk across the rail all the way to the support pylon. From there, I just fell onto the lip of the room and placed my camp inside
---
I have a exec 50 25 I have tested multiple Gauss shotguns I can solo anything in the game I don't need to test or do anything maybe don't rely on YouTube.
---
saved up for what, you have 11K worth of atoms meaning u dont spend shit, so ur pile of atoms is just sitting there 
---
with the seasons u gain cosmetics / atomic shop items directly, so u dont need to spend ur atoms which u dont anyway
---
I‚Äôm excited for Cyberpunk because maybe it will show some of these companies what putting more than minimal effort into a new game means.
---
Last time I suggested keeping things like the scrap box and such in FO1st because it's what makes people pay for the subscription and thus support the game and keep it from being abandoned I was attacked and downvoted into oblivion.
---
Lol dude, use vats, hit something then hit the same thing normally. Massive damage. Did you even watch the video. It's a well known bug.
---
Go test it properly.
---
I have one my self quad, 33% hit. I can 2 shot a scorch beast or behemoth.
---
It doesn't matter it still works it's actually a bug with more then just shotguns.
---
Are you on PC? If so the bad news is there‚Äôs a hacked one that only takes 100 rounds.
---
I love CDPR I was just talking to a friend about that. They are a great example of how micro transactions / app purchases ect aren‚Äôt necessary to make a great fame and still profit. Even though I would love to spend money on a good game and would appreciate that kind of thing at that point.
---
These ares one of the best pictures I‚Äôve ever seen taken in this game. Absolutely amazing
---
I‚Äôm not actively rooting for this game, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It feels like a dead husk that‚Äôs being paraded around. Though tbh, a worthwhile turn around would be so sweet to see but I don‚Äôt believe it will happen until some things change both within the community AND the studio, then gameplay, graphics and everything will hopefully improve. It‚Äôs like how they are saying the next Elder Scrolls game and Star whatever (I‚Äôm not following that game) are gonna run off the same engine as they‚Äôve used since fo 3, and oblivion. If the community wants a new, improved, and overall decent engine like some do; it‚Äôs gonna take the community to put its foot down and say we will stop buying your games until you show us you‚Äôll actually try for once. Then the Studio may actually listen and change. Until then, nothing is gonna come from any bugs, glitches, or overall marketing scheme for this game or their next several games
---

---
Did you hear about how during development they still proceeded to upgrade their graphics/lighting/engine to beat industry standard?  It‚Äôs crazy how far they‚Äôve came since that first gameplay reveal. 
---
Bethesda **could** learn a lot from this
---
Are you on PC?
---
Agreed.
---
Send me a message, I'll give you some copper. I don't use it for anything other than building right now üòÇ

Theres a few detailed posts about it, you'd have to search the sub. It appears to be 5 or 6 pieces to a map
---
I'd kill for some real sugar bomb cereal

You don‚Äôt see people role playing in voice chat because most role players think voice chat is horrible for role playing. I‚Äôve been an avid role player in several MMOs - even in MMOs with easy voice chats, I‚Äôve never seen it used for serious role playing. And personally I will never RP through any voice chat. It is just not conducive to good role play. They add in actual text chat to 76, not a mod, and I‚Äôll get into it here. Until then, with only voice chat? Not going to happen for me.
---
Ye, it's one of the nicest bundles in the game
---
I can build it for you if you want (:
---
Goddamnit... yea im on PC
---
The reason I quit 76 was Fallout 1st and the constant crashes, bluescreens and glitches. This game could have been so awesome, but alas it is not. To everyone paying for first, I want you to know people like you are the death of gaming. You condoned Bethesdas BS by paying for 1st, and now there is no going back. Rip 76, it was a blast while it lasted.
---
I have a commando and use Daddy-O, Psycho, Mentats, Day Tripper and Alcohol. It spreads the minuses out with a hit of like -3 to Cha and -1 to the other stats
---
First I've seen or heard of it, thanks!
---
No it dose not
---
You‚Äôre trying to reason with fanatics man.
---
All the cosmetic rewards from nw are account wide and available in adventure. Also your special stats from adventure determine what perk cards you can equip in nw
---
Just because something you do works does not mean there is not another way that is better.  In this case, the links provided show a way to get more damage than you're currently getting.
---
yeah thats the point, i guess i missed the /s
---
Well, the person who traded me the weapon was clueless about the weapon being hacked and did the honorable thing and gave my stuff back.
---
one source without thinking of representation bravo
---
Thanks for sharing, they are all amazing.
---
Excellent shots and an even better eye!
---
I do have to say they did the Pumpkin House pretty bogus. I live just down the street from it and the house they constructed in game looks nothing like the real one. Ah well, minor gripe. At least they included it.
---
Have you tried soap and water and a non fragrant deodorant, could be you're a bit stinky

Done and doing :P

I would love to take the burden of hosting a server off of Bethesda and put it onto my own infrastructure as a private server, hell, lock my character to it, I don't care. I want mods to fix all the shitty game-play decisions Bethesda makes.

The challenges are really easy to do, I tend to get dailies done in 30 mins - 1hr depending on what events there are.

Are you on ps4 yet?

sometimes my fixer has an ammo clip of a heavy gun
---
yep
---
High rad fluids were annoying to get, but once got a ton from finding an ultracite vein in nuke zone, which spawned waves of scorched every time it's touched. Just kept on spawning and killing  them. Got enough HRF for anything needed at the time.
---
Anyways, nice tactic on getting your Violets, will try it! üëç
---
Only for t45 i think
---
Finally someone said it. Google the board members and tell me there isn't a push to make money not a good game. Trumps brother is on the board of zeni and has had some serious health issues lately.
---
Oh please. This development studio (and even at a higher level as a publisher) has no rapport with which to base this good faith on. Literally every patch or major content update has been delayed for weeks or months. Every single patch (EVERY SINGLE ONE) has introduced new bugs that sit and sit for weeks and months or forever and then maybe we are lucky to get a patch that quashes a 1/3 of the ones they just introduced while the backlog keeps growing. Vending keeps getting disabled, camp budgets keep getting fucked up, storage is a nightmare always, the combat and damage system are incredibly inconsistent and barely functional, pvp is a literal wasteland filled with hackers, the lag is intolerable and I could keep going for a few more minutes if you like. What have they done to address any of these systemic issues? Not a god damned thing except drip feed buggy content in and make a barely concealed attempt at monetizing EVERYTHING. Every system in this game is designed to keep you grinding and drain your resources while you grind, and then encouraging you to fill in the holes in your grind with atom store purchases. Don't even get me started on the abortion that is ammo points or perk coins and you are kidding yourself if them "going back to the drawing board" is anything but another poorly disguised attempt at minimizing the backlash while still doing exactly what they want to. 
---
Every problem with this game can be traced back to tech debt and greed. It is really rather simple, and it grosses me out as fallout fan.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles do this for it.
---
Have you done the excavator quest yet? You can get it via that
---
I wonder if it has anything to do with this year being a leap year and a date/time miscalculation
---
Alien Abduction- could tie into the Zeta lore or just be a fun, lighthearted encounter.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of entitled people on this sub that don‚Äôt understand this.
---
I have done it up to where you begin to build to the armor, but I don't yet have enough black titanium. Do you have to complete the quest in order to receive the plan?
---
cry and move on to ur next weapon
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll definitely try this.
---
Clean sink probably still gives dirty water.
---
my instigating combat shotgun with 50% limb dmg will get u rekt
---
Just realized this is exactly what the other commenter was talking about, I don't have enough materials to build the power armor yet, so I guess I have some farming to do. Thanks anyways.
---
I‚Äôve seen posts that would like to see this but there is no solid information out there that completely confirms such a thing. I, for one, think it is likely though.
---
How many caps for this base?
---
I with you, I tried fortnight when that first came out and after 2 games never touched it again, and same with the  modern warfare one. Fallout is for me is pve.
---
My understanding is that you get less atoms from playing the game, but in the same time a lot more direct rewards, skin and item, through scores points.
---
Since we can get score point with atoms this would be a little odd to get a lot of atoms this way
---
we need to see how it goes in practice
---
I think its more of a case of if its not making money then they'll think its not worth supporting, rather than they cant support it. Bethesda is a pretty big company and they have multiple ways of getting income.
---
I just need the helmet but I‚Äôm taking a long break
---
Jesus, as if we haven't seen 200 happy birthday posts on r/Fallout... 
---
Thanks for the reminder, I had no idea /s
---
Huge wot, the game mainly focusing on solo game with friends. mmo part is just not there yet. So If you played a lot of mmo this is not that kind of game.
---
Text chat, Mails, Account wide stuffs, guilds, action house trading is a small floating island here :D
---
They could remove the earning of Atoms entirely for all I care. It is the stash limitation that screws me over on a day to day basis. Couldnt care less about a few cosmetic items.
---
Its not some unknown work of a art that needs to be experienced. Its a generic season pass dressed up in some sexy atom store graphics and it is [designed to extract your money](https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-everyone-its-time-to-stop-buying-season-passes-at-launch). 
---
Additionally, they just posted in the new inside the vault that each rank would take 1-2 hours (2 on the later ranks) and you can spend 150-200 bucks to buy it out after July.
---
I said it earlier but where is all this good faith coming from? They have a shitty track record and have since the beta.
---
I'm so glad about that. I play maybe 6 hours a weeks so by my calculations it would take around 6 months to get to lvl 100. I really hope I can get the Blood Eagle Handmade skin though, it'll go nice with my blood washed combat armour.
---
Yes. There‚Äôs titanium available at the junkyard workshop in the forest
---
Hey, I know this is months old, but thanks for the answer. 
---
I thought you had to link your bethesda account to steam BEFORE the 28th, and I was upset I hadn't. So I linked them after the 28th, and checked my steam library, didn't see 76, 2 or 1. 
---
But just a couple days ago, I noticed my steam library had 76, 2 and 1 recently added. Do you know why this is? Did it just take a while to roll out to me?
---
Thanks.
---
Are you trying to highlight the "designed to extract your money" thing like it's some grand secret that you've discovered that the rest of us sheep haven't figured out?
---
No shit Sherlock.
---
I find trading to be huge on fallout 76, you pretty much cannot get some desired items without trading with someone who has it. I think that‚Äôs the problem with the game though, but the issue is that the trading system is god awful and they should implement a simple trade window.
---
Seasons isn't coming on Tuesday is it? I thought they said it was delayed along with the new Wendigo Colossus event?
---
Yeah man that kids gunnu fuck up your game time. Just had my first in Feb and I'm lucky to sneak in a half hour a day lol. Good luck man!
---
Looking at that spreadsheet there is a max sell and buy on every ammo type. For .38 it says max sell of 1800, however I don't know if that means you can sell 1800 .38 rounds or 1800 points of .38 which amounts to 1620 rounds based on the sell price and the count. Could be I'm completely misinterpreting that chart but I definitely think you're right.
---
And again, your logic is flawed. You keep looking at stuff he has done in the franchise, which makes him relevant for that, but he adds nothing to 76, so he's not important as an individual character for that game.
---
Imagine this: they change the overser to someone else after release, which is something people would notice, but if they changed the info on the terminal, 99% of players would not notice, because it does not matter.
---
They did not NEED to add his name om the terminal, but they did NEED a main quest character. You can't compare what house has done in the franchise to a character that's literally the main quest npc in 76, even before wastelanders. That's like saying a certain character is relevant in a movie, tho the character is only seen walk by for 5sec in the background and never mentioned again, just because he's the creator of something in another movie set in the same universe. That does not make the character relevant. His actions in the former movie might be, but not him as an individual character in the new one.
---
 You can in fact have done something that's relevant to the lore of a franchise, without being relevant as a character in every game/movie your creations are in.
---
It shows up as a item that can be upgraded. I hope it‚Äôll be fixed in a future update.
---
You can buy it from the Brotherhood vendors, in Watoga and in The Whitesprings Resort for example, for around 1000 caps. If you get another one from the Miner Miracles quest, you'll be able to resell it for 2000 caps pretty easily in your vending machine.
---
Have you tried this?
---
Documents - games - fallout 76 
---
Or wherever you keep your fallout76prefs file, open it with notepad, search for 
---
uVivoxVoiceVolume
---
and make sure it is set to 100 
---
uVivoxVoiceVolume=100
---
That was what finally fixed the voice issue for me.
---
Ah, great to hear. Thanks.
---
I'll admit I'm not terribly interested in NW by itself, but seeing all those incomplete challenges in the menu is giving me anxiety, lol
---
Server hop until you find the Scorch Queen area nuked. In these areas all ferns under any grouping of trees will give violet flux. Use green thumb and super duper perk cards
---
The cranberry bog has a decent amount of it when nuked. Be sure to have green thumb set as a perk when picking it and equip the third rank of Super Duper when crafting the stable flux to maximize crafting effectiveness.
---
Same. My twitch reflexes aren't great - if I do get the drop on someone I'm inevitably too excited to shoot straight and get killed soon after, lol
---
I was absolutely fuming when it became clear Fortnite was going to focus on Battle Royal.
---
Wait, you have to buy the stuff with atoms?
---
I was talking to strem last night and got a load off the list. I am giving him the remaining serum plans and i have found a load more pa ones as well.
---
Oh man,this game requires so much damn time after you finish the main wastelanders quest so I wish you best of luck whenever you have free time to play after your child arrives
---
Yesterday I nuked the Grafton area including Hemlock Holes maintenance &amp; Becker Farm, north of Grafton.
---
The flux ferns were incredible, and they seemed to re-spawn once during nuke zone period.. Came away with a few hundred using Green Thumb and over a hundred Stable violet (I stopped counting), I already had stock of other required ingredients and I used the fridge backpack mod to prevent spoilage.
---
I checked the crate there‚Äôs nothing there and it says 900
---
Your main point was "how can you know the system is bad before its even out" mine was that there is not some unseen depth to the season pass that somehow makes any of these decisions not greed based. My other point was that it will for sure take 1-2 hours per rank and you can pay 150 dollars to finish the pass after mid July. This system sucks ass and balls and is not a benefit to the player-base. I am also willing to bet that this new patch also introduces some shitty bugs (just like every one before it) that wont be patched for months or ever.
---
Wow, so sorry I happened to post a similarly themed thread roughly thirteen hours ago that was explaining an entirely different aspect of this shit.  I'm sure I just ruined your reddit experience for the day.  If you want you can contact the mods and have both of these deleted so we can make room in reddits very limited servers for the fiftieth thread complaining about how Bethesda sucks.
---
Thank you for the info, ill have to go claim that one
---
Yeah I also don't like it at all. I just do it for the cosmetics. Level 90 currently. Waiting for the next double to grind out the last 10 levels. I just live the Bush wookie life and watch TV while I do it haha
---
So you're saying Bethesda is greedy for giving us a new *free* way to get atoms and other cosmetics? Not to mention the challenges are going to be more aimed towards normal play and less specific. I get you can't please everyone but really my guy, that just sounds kinda sad.
---
The legendary perks and colossus event are delayed, but seasons is being released on Tuesday:)
---
Thank for the info.
---
Members of your public team will not be able to build at your camp, and you can't build at theirs. If you create a private team, you will all be able to build at each others camps. 
---
I hope this helps!
---
Daily challenges is the only thing thats kept me playing. Im really disappointed
---
If you have numbers from the other platforms feel free to post them, it's not the main point of my post. More so trying to suggest tools to benefit the RP community.
---
I live about an hour and a half away from here. I can smell the manure and moth balls in these pictures.
---
People are just gonna have to suck it up and be happy with what they're given. Just be thankful Bethesda hasn't locked story content and seasons behind paywalls yet.
---
It's all speculation.
---
Did we beat the scorched, work together, and just wall ourselves off from the rest of the world?
---
Maybe we did beat the scorched, but at the cost of our own lives?
---
Or did we fail miserably, turning on each other like the previous survivors, a failure to trust leading to history repeating?
---
Past Games have said nothing on the subject and even future releases might ignore the topic while 76 is still running, and it's unlikely Bethesda will spill the beans anytime soon for the same reason.
---
Yeah, fair enough I was reading them in order and replying in order so I didn't notice your last point until I'd already written it. Knew I'd get a retort comment about it. It's alright, it's my bad.   
---
All the same, there doesn't have to be a 'superior reason', there are reasons. That's enough. RP is one of them.
---
PC? If so I have a TSE -25%vats pump for sale/trade.
---
It certainly is a problem and the trading window would be a huge addition.
---
Also high end weapons should be bop and earned by reputations or high-end boss drops ISS, SBQ not random lvl50+ bloating flies drops and tradables. (MMO style)
---
PS: sorry for your trading loss. I make clips(obs) for my tradings,  but it will not make it safe or avoid scams.
---
Nice work! üòç
---
The raw flux is not the problem .. can get that easy enough after every Queen event. But glowing/hardened mass and high rad. fluid only drop off nuked npc's... So you have to kill a lot of those FIRST. Raw flux will spoil rather quickly...
---
Completely agree with the trading menu. I‚Äôve been scammed by a legacy scammer. It‚Äôs that little percent that‚Äôs extremely toxic and scummy. Hope you recoup your losses.
---
Thanks for the clarification! Something new to do I guess
---
Doesn't benefit the playerbase?  For fuck sake it is literally free shit being handed out for just playing the game.  All they've done is swapped over from handing out nothing but currency to handing out a mixture of currency and cosmetics.
---
&gt; I haven‚Äôt given BGS any of my money since launch and don‚Äôt plan to. (In regards to claims this will boost real-world money purchases)
---
That's OK buddy. There's plenty of us out here who will pay for your game for you. You just sit back and enjoy the free ride and continued development you didn't pay for.

---
Don't know about other systems but if you're on xbox use the lfg page. Just post that you have the event on and people will join
---
I could be wrong but I could have sworn that it was confirmed the robots supposedly do it. At least with sunset sarsaparilla.
---
Yeah, and also I think that if they added something to the game such as things like legacies, you should either completely remove them or just leave them in the game and allow them to be obtainable. I don‚Äôt see the point of removing it, the only beneficial thing that comes out of this is for people who are dupers and have their hands on these high end items. It‚Äôs quite lame when they sell it on eBay or something and people do in fact spend money of them. My guess was that their is possibly even Bethesda employees who would purposely hide a secret dupe method just so they can make easy side money, it‚Äôs just a random assumption but it‚Äôs quite likely in my pov.
---
GG!
---
After all the crap we have endured with this game since beta, and the fact that there are STILL glitches  (looking at you fast travel bug), i really thought that seasons was going to be added in as something on top of daily and weekly challenges. 
---
I play almost exclusively just to do those every day, plus the few in game dailies. Its whats kept me going. And being able to earn enough atoms to get one or two nice things a month. 
---
Now we lose all of those atoms and have to get stupid repair and scrap kits and whatever items they decide we get just so we grind more. 
---
I hate it.
---
No, you CAN but you don't have to.  You can either just play the game and unlock stuff slowly over the course of the season or you can spend atoms to unlock ranks early.
---
No problem! For sure though. At least up until you reach rank 100 long before the fall season haha
---
Very well could be downvoted for this but....considering this is a live service....it makes sense. For people who don't have fallout 1st, doing the dailies let they save up and never spend money. They gotta make the game profitable to continue justifying support.
---
Lol Id love to see a Brahmin panic as its slowly tractor beamed into a ship.
---
If i could upvote this twice I would. Yea I found her a few games later walking around outside crator behind the place with all the crafting tables. Sounds like she needs an attitude adjustment too. Im surprised she didnt just wall thru those stingers like they were flowers .
---
They need to fix the high radiation fluid drop rate. Its absolutely ridiculous
---
Question, you play on xbox?
---
That‚Äôs a known issue. It has something to do with the game not showing your steam name. I don‚Äôt believe they are hacked accounts though.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for RP groups to Join in 76, but I just never can find them.
---
I imagine you must have fast traveled a lot. Took me three weeks to beat wastelanders and I was playing four hours or so a night but I walked everywhere. You should definitely walk from location to location, you will be able to see how the map has changed and come across a lot of interesting special encounters.
---
While that's true, there are very few businesses I can think of that would keep pumping resources into a game that's losing money without attempting to make more money out of it. 
---
I wouldn't want them theoretically having to take resources away from Starfield or Elder Scrolls Six just to keep Fallout 76 afloat.
---
I‚Äôve honestly just completely forgotten about losing the gun, I mean it‚Äôs a game and this won‚Äôt affect my life too much. It‚Äôs just that these people even existing just frustrates me, these are also easily avoidable if Bethesda could just add a trade window. I know people would tell me ‚Äúget a courier‚Äù, but sometimes it takes too long to find a verified courier on PS4 because the community is quite small, and also couriers are also potentially scammers. Although I hope I do have some good fortune with finding good trades in the future, I‚Äôm thankful to have traded and met so many nice people. This was my first time being scammed on fallout 76 and this is actually the second attempt. The first attempt, someone didn‚Äôt want to use any couriers except for their friends, which is a huge no no because that‚Äôs pretty much the same as trading with them directly. They later apologized about it and it baffled me, like you just tried scamming me and now you want to be all chummy with me?
---
Exactly word for word how I feel. 
---
It should have been an add on on top of daily and weekly atom challenges. Never a replacement.
---
Nope you dont.
---
Can we try and have some clarity of thought though? No sarcasm no edginess if they start with what i suggested they‚Äôll be able to make more traditional content. Don‚Äôt bury it with a laundry list they need to start someplace and fixing breaching with the most simple suggestion I could think of will be the most benefit most immediately when it comes to them making future content.
---
Ok
---
Am I reading that right? 27 THOUSAND?! What are you holding out for?
---
Name a better one?
---
(So I can keep my eyes open!)
---
Sorry. I haven't played a while. What is seasons?
---
Yeah i get that, kind of a mixed bag when it comes to pooling resources ig. I mean ideally it would be pretty epic just to be able to host our own servers and stuff cough. Lol
---
That shows how players are different. PA skins, weapon and apparel skins are only thing I'm interested in. Couldn't care less for C.A.M.P. stuff, as I've found out in a hard way that you can't enjoy your new stuff as much as you'd like, because building budget is too low for everything to fit.
---
I think Bethesda earns enough for the service they provide, and we should all have the right to enjoy the game for any cent spent on it. Asking price for the title was "triple A" money, but was/is expected to pay monthly for same user experience level, which is annoyingly wrong. Sure, cosmetic and some advance quality of life stuff can be "premium" ( like tent, increased C.A.M.P. budget, and access to some account premium cosmetic stuff like unique emotes/icons/outfits ), but overcoming artificial limiting factors included in game shouldn't - like Scrap box. Not that it shouldn't exist, but it shouldn't be payed for.
---
Yeah.
---
Was slow for me today too, seems they cut off your acess at 00:01 on renewal day and then charges your account later duting the day.
---
Give it to people who care to make it work.
---
I couldnt agree more man people get this concept that Bethesda just have too much money and players expect everything to be handed to them for free they should be happy that Bethesda are even giving out these updates for free ans should stop complaining over cosmetics sure they look cool but you dont need them me personally will probably never buy atoms but i will still stick to my monthly fallout 1st mostly because it gives you atoms. players should just grow up and just accept that developers still need money to support not just the game but the people that are putting hours of there time to improve the game.
---
Son of a gun! I was playing found that
---
Except the atoms you can earn have been massively reduced, the major rewards are some cosmetics mixed in with a bunch of useless bullshit nobody wants like player icons, and its intention by your own admission is to get people to specifically not want to grind so they spend money to get the numbered cosmetic they happen to like. I have spent a lot of money on independent atom purchases, and am also an annual fo76 subscriber and the expectation for me after already sinking 900 hours into the game since beta with this new system is to sink an additional 150 hours, or spend 150 of my real dollars for cosmetics? AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO IS CONFUSED!?
---
I started with just the arm plans, built them and entered the chassis. Nothing in fallout has ever been as swole
---
I definitely agree. The fact that we don't have persistent private servers in a survival game is atrocious.  
---
Personally, I think they'd make buckets of money if they just listened to fans more but I guess we get what we get x.x
---
Just like how you can rush all the weekly challenges in 2 hours and not have any more until the daily reset...it's the same idea here, but they are lowering the total amount and increasing the time frame. The idea of finite rewards is irrelevant because there was never anything else, that's a constant between the old and new systems
---
Instead im gonna put 76 down for awhile.
---
The person who gave them to you weren't banned. Likely you won't either
---
Multiple players all bored thinking it's funny maybe...
---
Somebody randomly gave me like, 4k the other day. I used maybe 30, might have been more, just to max out my caps, then I dropped them in one of those acid lakes up by grafton with like 2 minutes till the server shut down
---
Yeah. People are bored or whatever, because they twist everything against Bethesda. Why they are even here then?
---
When the game monetisation is discussed, everyone jumps on the greedy Bethesda for having Microtransactions in a full-priced game. And having free Atoms doesn't count, because they are "too few and too grindy".
---
Having things like the fridge (or its alternatives) in the Atom shot is apparently pay to win. Being able to earn Atoms to buy it doesn't count.
---
But NOW, suddenly free Atoms are the bread and butter of the game and changing some Atoms into predefined SCORE rewards is evil...
---
Most of the stuff in the atomic shop is junk,so it evens out.
---
That's the point, they bought the game in a specific state.
---
They ARE entitled.
---
was it a fixer, on PC? plenty of hacked fixers and handmades with the freezing/poison effect.
---
Best of luck. The wasteland will seem like heaven once the little one arrives :) Congrats though friend
---
Are you kidding me? Like I understand that they need to make money to keep up the game, but unless they‚Äôre going to be making serious overhauls to the game this is just some serious bullroar
---
You lost me adter that first sentence. You think Bethesda can just walk away from Zenimax? Zenimax owns it, Zenimax makes all the decisions.
---
Would have been windfall if it was located in WV
---
Great, more "points" to keep track of. What do you bet they will have a daily limit that is laughably small? They could have just done a direct conversion instead of adding more unnecessary numbers into everything
---
I focus on buying camp stuff I'll know I'll get a lot of use out of, totally avoid overpriced stuff like PA skins and usually wait for stuff to return at a discount over buying it new at full price.  
---
I'm also a  bit of a money hoarder to begin with, saving up for "just in case" situations whether that's a whole bunch of good stuff I need to buy immediately showing up at once, if Bethesda focused more on expensive bundles or higher priced items and having expected for a while that eventually they'd likely reduce the free atom income and having a stockpile would pay off in  the long run.
---
I hate people like that too, and honestly I think their IP addresses should be banned, characters deleted, and game access revoked
---
RuneScape had those trade windows in like 2001 lmao I 100% agree 76 needs something like that
---
I feel like Bethesda expected caps to hold their value better, especially with a 25k then 30k limit, then we could have made it a bit safer (at least you got the caps kind of thing) but they should have known that's really difficult in an online game
---
Good luck in your future trades :) I find most people in 76 are decent but there will always be greedy idiots
---
Literally everything that happened was your own fault
---
You're on pc so it was a modded weapon mate
---
Amazin!
---
I used to buy atoms regularly until they added Fallout 1st, I haven't bought any since, nor have I bought F1st.
---
The fact you have stockpiled 27000 free atoms would strongly indicate that they have not provided stuff you actually want in the atomic store. So logically even if they never gave you free atoms again, you would have no reason to purchase atoms. 
---
Obviously the game needs supported to continue development, Every single day people post about items they want in the store, they do not appear, The fact i constantly see FO 1st items, and atom store purchases in game, and the sheer number of people on these boards claiming to have bought atoms indicates people are buying atoms, so again, logically if there was items in the store people wanted, they would purchase them. If there were a steady stream of high quality, non bugged, items in the store, people would not have the atoms stockpiled to buy all they wanted, so would buy more atoms.
---
A game like this is supported by a few whales, and supplemented by the majority of players making purchases, Only a small percentage of players will absolutely never buy anything at all. The fact is we have no idea how much this game is making a day, or a month. We also have no idea how much money it needs to make a day, or month to continue development. I think it is counter productive to think "if we only gave them more money" suddenly this entire situation would improve, i suspect all that would change is Bethesda would make more money, and learn that they can make that amount of money for little effort.
---
It is just a thing in a game, but scamming still ain‚Äôt right. I‚Äôm ok Xbox, and there‚Äôs barely any couriers on here. Do you know what you need to become a courier? Anyway, let‚Äôs dream that there was a trading menu, because I doubt they‚Äôll implement one. Have a good one, my friend.
---
Lol. Seriously? You must be one of ‚Äúthose‚Äù.
---
It's a game. Calm down, take a breath and learn from the experience; don't carry stable flux around a workshop.
---
I‚Äôm not a game dev and probably have no idea of the difficulty, but I think a trade window is easy af to make. Pretty much every game that had trading has this feature, also if it was too hard to do where both players can add/take things out of the window, just make it so you can choose what you want the other person to give you similar to the [REQUESTED] thing when you are on the trade screen. Then both sides need to press some sort of agree button in order to initiate the trade and also if something gets added/taken out, it‚Äôll unready your acception.
---
Why not just allow us to scrap unneeded ammo?  This seems like an overly complicated solution to a simple problem.
---
You should be hired to shoot the next loading screens for the new Fallout üò±üò±
---
Fortnite is a better bet ,to be honest ...its free and you can play quick matches
---
I dont know what one of those implies but at level 116 you should know about how pvp works you shouldnt have left flux in your inventory when taking over a workshop common sense
---
It‚Äôs a game? I thought it was real life. Lol. It‚Äôs still frustrating. And that‚Äôs it.
---
Russian you say...
---
Hold on I think my communist detector is going off üëÄüëÄ
---
I took it out of my vending for a sale the night before and forgot about it. I actually went to my stash to get it out later that day after the incident to make the sale thinking I had put it there, but clearly I had taken it out of vending and put it on self. And FO76 ain‚Äôt true PVP anyhow, so there‚Äôs that too
---
I have a specific space carved out in my camp bedroom just so I can finally make a toilet now
---
You go into a workshop with valuable junk. There is a pop up that says you are accepting pvp when you take it. 
---
You saw that pop up and went ahead with it while carrying said valuable junk that you didn't want to lose. 
---
So whatever "one of those" is supposed to be, maybe  stash your junk before accepting pvp next time? Just a suggestion but hey you do you. 
---
P.s. level means nothing in pvp past 60 or so.
---
I haven't had anyone test it yet. I do check from time to time to see if anything is gone from the bowl and then use that to tell whether or not it goes in order or it is random
---
never underestimate the value of a well placed tree. The elm tree bundle is one of my favorite items bought.
---
Is your 50 cal missing its handle? As others said, hacked weapon unfortunately :(
---
That would be perfect, like you said I really can't see it being that difficult to add in, and it would definitely earn them some good will from the players lmao
---
It would also be nice if market76 actually incentivized the Courier positions, there are only like 6/platform or something, and as is right now they basically do it out of the goodness of their heart and people miiiiight tip them
---
If they required a 1 or 2k value tip (caps or ammo probably) I think a lot more people would sign up, and be more willing to respond when people call a courier
---
Didn't notice or look. I don't have it anymore.
---
Settle down, snowflake.
---
The only reason I'm using the atom shop at all is because I get free atoms. 
---
There's nothing in the shop I'd ever want to spend real money on. Too much goofy shit.
---
Also, it's not at all the consumer's problem if they make money or not. Bethesda's entire job is to convince us to shell over money. It's not the player's problem if they fail at that.
---
Sure. I guess I should have stated that I was carrying the flux unbeknownst to myself. I was unaware that I took it out of my vending the night before for a sale today but thought I had put it in my stash but instead put it on self.
---
Understandably so, but remember that you put yourself in the situation in the first place. Sometimes in an online game it's easy to get mad at the other person and think they're a jerk when really they're just playing a game and got the best of you. Go ahead and be mad, but you should be mad at yourself.
---
üòÇ Those of you that are taking this serious, don‚Äôt, because it was suppose to be a lighthearted, somewhat comical, typical, janky FO76 dialogue.
---
You had flux on you while you had a workshop?  Sounds like lesson learned to me.
---

---
If that's the case, you need to work on your comedy game.
---
It will be probably faster to hunt mole miners in the ash heap for black titanium, the miner suit parts contain it. Bonus: XP, meat and lots of weapons to sell.
---
I am on pc. I knew that it was a effect in fallout 4 but I didn‚Äôt know they were hacked into this game.
---
Could be true. But it‚Äôs water under the bridge that I thought I‚Äôd share with the FO76 community. You are probably correct. Still frustrating. Lol. Lesson learned.
---
Its only not "true pvp anyhow" to the losers
---
Do you have any mutations that might cause AoE damage, like the poison cloud one, or something similar?
---
I clearly should have stated this in the post. (I was carrying it unknowingly).
---
I only have standard bullets. But as you see in the video below I had a mellee weapon in my hand. I just pressed E to talk to him and he just died
---
u/ladydevann
---
üëç
---
Are you PC? I can give you some fluxes for free.
---
if you‚Äôve tried placing something over it and it doesn‚Äôt disappear then you can‚Äôt get rid of it sorry.
---
You can have FO76 PVP ALL DAY. You ain‚Äôt gotta try and convince me. This is one area that even Bethesda will admit it failed‚ÄîPVP.
---
Yepp just gotta look before you buy something from a vendor on pc
---
These weapons are in the game for long time... If Beth let people selling these hacked weapons be sold in vendors? I'd buy them, no stress.
---
I see you managed to return it, nice of the other person to do that :)
---
I don't like getting less atoms but they did warn us we'd get less. Instead of atoms it sounds like we'll be earning items directly instead.
---
PS4. It‚Äôs ok. I thought I‚Äôd stir the pot of discussion a bit, and see if anyone else had any similar stories. Clearly no one ever has. üôÑ
---
It's maybe because...
---
"YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!!!"
---
Project Paradise is able to be solo run.  Done it 3 or so times myself and honestly it feels sometimes easier alone when people are not unloading the quest items.
---
So what I should make my own faction? Pvp faction?
---
Still missing a berserker build, but had a blast leveling up a gunslinger recently. Not OP, could use some love from the developers but still viable - I have no troube clearing out Westek, taking down SBs or doing enough damage during Queen fights. [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eurg4r/big_iron_midroadss_guide_to_the_full_life/) that helped me the most to get the char in good 'shape'
---
Obviously not.how dare you even think this?
---
First you put out the skin,then you wait for the rant and only THEN you maybe patch it.
---
pussies shoot in the back poor or strange childhood examples learned. IMHO
---
Yeah, no, I'm talking mutations.
---
Have a look on your stats screen, see what your current effects are. If you get explosed to rads for too long, or too strong, you can "mutate", which is a double edged sword.
---
Like, stronger melee, but weaker defence.
---
One of them has the player emit a poison cloud that damages and can kill people in close range.
---
How do you post a link to imgur that reddit lets you use?
---
Yea it was. I don't know if he was unaware it was a hacked item or not (he claimed so), or he was just scared of getting banned in the trading reddit place. But he gave my stuff back, and i returned the item to him.
---
Anti-Armour Stealth commando is pretty nice, not crazy op but I can solo most things that don't absolutely require a team
---
Even almost killed sbq solo the other day but she kept flying so far away (because I'm sneaking) that her health regened, had her almost dead twice
---
That wasn't how the game was sold to me. I don't have a problem with Bethesda making money, but what was sold was the idea that you would buy the game and it would get regular ongoing updates. Atoms would be available to buy if you wanted them. Pete Hines went out of his way to ensure people that the Atomic Shop would only sell cosmetics. I'm not saying I trusted that, but I figured I could get my money's worth before they turn it off. And I have. Sort of. Fo76 is the worst Fallout game I have played (Fo1, Fo2, Fo3, Fo4, Fo:NV). It is definitely the most boring, having the least and worst content.
---
I hope so but I'm pretty sure the fixer doesn't even have a slot for paint right now, so sadly I kind of doubt it unless they add it with patch 20
---
Whereas things like Secret Service Armour already have a slot despite not yet having paints until the season comes out
---
I like the Instigating Hunting Rifle, with the Refined .50 Receiver.  It will have several percent more damage than a .308 Hardened, plus the ammo is way easy/cheap to make.
---
the points remain the same, bethesda *is* zenimax. for all intents and purposes (except taxes) they are the same company
---
Fair play, it's always hard to tell
---
I run a Berserker's Heavy weapons build, it's both fun and makes you rethink how you play.
---
Poor guy had a hard life leveling up,lol
---
Oh sorry I read your previous comment wrong. I have no mutations.
---
No you're breathtaking!
---
These are amazing I do exactly the same. Although, mine tend to be more like my characters holiday photos dressed in matching clothes e.g. at uncanny caverns I‚Äôm wearing full miner gear. Just wanted to share my favourite one though, in taggerdys office there‚Äôs a photo of her crew on the desk and it makes a great[BOS Loading Screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/CTaOrhc)
---
Because Bethesda have always been and will always be greedy fuckwits?  
---
Plus, look at some of the items we get from the seasons: Lunch Boxes.  
---
I'd bet top dollar that those will be on the atom store before long, just like the scrap and repair kits.
---
Nice. I'll check the link out shortly. I e been thinking gunslinger too tbh. Just something different to mess around with, plus not worrying about trades as much for God tier weapons. And my main has a few nice pistols too.
---
Also, it would normally take a few seconds to a few minutes to earn those daily atoms, now it will take several hours to earn those atoms on a rank (150 I believe) and you will only get the entire 1500 if you grind out the several hundred hours it will take to complete the season.
---
AA was in my thoughts as well. It's good knowing AA weapons aren't as desirable and I have a good amount of AA weapons on my main.
---
Ah, that suck, man. I guess she got away.
---
Berserkers builds are terrible. No armor is fine but no legendary effects feels terrible and limits you significantly. If you want a new and fun play style I‚Äôd recommend an unarmed build. You can go bloodied with bolstering armor or junkies with vanguards armor. Both play the same way of running around punching things until they explode. You can also play stealth with unarmed and the Chinese stealth suit with assassin perks. So it gives you a lot of room to try things out. It‚Äôs also super easy early game because you don‚Äôt need any ammo. And unarmed weapons are cheap to repair and have large condition bars making it a very easy play style that‚Äôs powerful and fun. Another reason for unarmed is that it only uses one perk card which frees up 6 additional perk points for more carry weight survival cards or other non essential but nice to have perks.  You can easily get a mole miners gauntlet early on from the ash heap and it will carry you until you can get the gauntlet from the settlers.
---
I can imagine leveling up being a bit more of a struggle, but that's what I'm after really.
---
I'm massively anti pvp against your will &amp; I agree that this is entirely on you.
---
Hope you learn from the experience &amp; stash important junk asap.
---
I actually just discovered the other day that if your armour breaks and you don't remove it you still get the legendary effects but no resistance
---
Haven't actually tried it with berserkers yet but I fully intend to
---
I'm pretty much only interested in the CAMP items, and some of the best ones are way down the line, so I may have a long grind ahead of me.
---
Interesting. I created a melee build but deleted it as I lost patience with being a low level again. But I'm dedicated this time lol. I'm trying not to get many weapon plans as I want my scrip rolls to be less varied. But I have thought about unarmed/heavy. Cheers for the information.
---
If they want me to spend money on their game they better fix their shit and stop releasing buggy updates. Why should i support a developer who doesn't respect me? Because when they released an update full of bugs or never fix bugs that have been around for a year it shows that they don't care about their game and customers
---
In that case, it's Bethesda, so looks like it's working as normal.
---
Thank you! I will keep this in mind if it happens again.
---
u so ugly he died
---
It was and I didn't help at all by making him live in the mire at a young age,lol!
---
Lots of dieing but better xp.
---
I'd rather have the atoms.
---
It's because Bethesda relies on atom sales and Fo1st to gain revenue.
---
Yeah it's pretty fun lol, my specials are S2 P12 E2 C6 I9 A10 L15
---
Don't use tank killer with AA weapons, something about diminishing returns blah blah, just put the armour piercing mag on and away you go
---
Yeah but Bethesda is a billion dollar company and this game made millions on launch. They aren‚Äôt an indie studio strapped for cash, they‚Äôre a multibillion dollar studio backed by a multibillion dollar company.
---
I saw I had an email from Steam, thanking me for my subscription renewal, perhaps it‚Äôll be working when I hop on later.
---
For real? I would greatly appreciate that tip! I've tried forever to get a foundation or floor that high up, I would love to hear any advice!
---
YUP! üòÇ
---
No  ps4 :-)
---
Probably server lag, he was already dead, killed by some mobs.
---
Wasteland breath...
---
It's only a suggestion. Seems you're halfway there, if you already have a team. I'm on PC, if you recruit other PC players I can play with them. You could have a discord and plan events like hold the fort or people can get together to one on one or team vs team.
---
:) I think I'll spend today trying to level up and see how far I get. No work so I'd be as well.
---
You can right click and view the original size, some are very detailed.
---
Nice. I'll definitely consider this type of build.
---
so u collect 27K atoms without paying for it and u also dont purchase anything with it, but u write this post 
---
what is ur point
---
For sure
---
I HATE how good this game looks on a pc üôÑüò©üòÇ
---
When was the last time ur character visited a rad shower? Lol
---
The point of microtransactions is that they need to be micro. So people spend without thinking too much until they realised they spent way too much on it. Of course I do not have the data to prove this will work better than the whale model. Maybe the whale concept (few customers buying a lot of very expensive products) is working out for Besthesda.
---
The fact that I've still not spend any free Atoms in the shop shows they do not have anything worth spending on. So they need better products.
---
Also, I have problems understanding why they withold and rotate merchanise that could be sold. The only thing I want is the Mr Pebbles backpack. Why is it not in the store ALL the time? Why is any product not in the stall ALL the time?
---
The Atom shop needs to follow the business model of any businees, have good products, and have them in stock for customers to purchase.
---
But apparently simple logic is too much for Bethesda
---
Vampire's is fun, especially on a weapon with a large magazine like a minigun. You practically never die, maybe unless if you're soloing Encryptid. Even then, with the right setup, you should be alright.
---
Yeah it's definitely an odd thing lol I have to wonder if it's a bug
---
Good luck :) I've got 4 alts 25 or lower and all but one Lvl 12 has become a mule lmao those poor overencumbered people
---
I have a hard time playing an alt knowing I could just be getting my main stronger
---
That would be a great to make PvP correctly in this game. No low damage first shot bs. Just pure arena PvP. Maybe add ranks that give rewards or just reward caps for winning that doesn't come out of the losing players funds. If a cap sink is wanted then add a cheap entry fee.
---
Yeah that is what happens in this community all they do is bitch and attack people who bitch about the same game.
---
I took a lengthy almost 6 month break leading up to Wastelanders, and ~~there wasn't anything to catch up on~~ now I'm back to playing it daily.
---
I'm actually really interested in the Ghillie armor paints, just because it will be nice to finally have a flush paint job without the need to get all of the same sort of armor
---
player vending is phased out by all the bad design choises/consessions Beth does to the cry babys,
---
Ex 1: everybody is working on their secret service armor, so whats the point of selling leggy armor anymore...
---
Ex 2: ammo is everywhere, to much, then we get the ammo machine, now we get an ammo convertor... so ammo wont sell anymore...
---
whats next?
---
this game s supposed to be a survival in a nuclear wasteland, but everything is just too easy ... its like sunny disneyland kidpark...
---
My concern would be people selling atoms/atom store items for real money on grey market sites, because gold farming is never a good thing in any online game. Could be done by creating a new character and farming some of the easier challenges, or worse by trying to steal people's accounts and sell any items they've bought &amp; atoms they've accumulated.
---
Berserker is fun. Yes, you have no armor and no legendary armor effects. Who cares? You also never have to repair your armor. Never tried heavy weapon berserker, but commando and unarmed works very good. It's easier if you skill to sneak. The large backpack mod lowering your dr.......cool, don't care. Nuke zone? Hazmat Suit, don't care! I die more often with my bloodied than with my berserker. And, it is easy to try. Grab a cheap berserker weapon, undress and have fun!
---
I would add some pasive slots, and fill them with usefull perks like "hacker and picklocker". It's anoying to change perk cards everytime you found a lock container
---
I think vamp will most likely be what I go for. My main has a nice vamp combat rifle and a few other weapons.
---
She would have made a better choice than Raider Punk
---
I think it would be a good ide to have an event you can start yourself where waves of enemies keep coming at you and get stronger every wave as it would also be a good way to get some legendarys and xp
---
I think it would be a good idea to have an event you can start yourself where waves of enemies keep coming at you and get stronger every wave as it would also be a good way to get some legendarys and xp
---
I've wondered about Berserkers...I will try it.
---
Interesting view and it will most likely be that or vamp. I know if I run commando again I can always switch it up with other builds which is a plus. But the challenge sounds good!
---
Valid lol but I feel like if u had to buy atoms they would still make money cause u can only earn a certain amount weekly or daily so it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to pay for it so u would still have to buy atoms on top making them still earn money
---
I feel like im missing more than i should of Fo76. Damn work
---
I have to agree and will make this point every time
---
Bethesda is a business, if they could afford it they would give out more free Atoms but realistically despite their big name, I can imagine their profits aren't very large (they donated a million to covid relief efforts which I heard was a big sum of money for them) 
---
Every business in order to stay afloat needs to make money so they create ways to make mone
---
Look what happened to Telltale, they fell under you want that to happen to Bethesda? Say bye bye to F76 and have EA probably take over the Fallout IP, watch then you'd wish Bethesda still own it
---
Yes they've made their mistakes, you can fault them but at the end of the day, I can tell they're trying
---
Very solid guide mate, thx. Also, Fo1st tent roofs doesn't seem to be registered as "ground" to the game. I most times get no dmg from ranged poison attacks like the mirelurkqueen or that SBQ attack when im sitting up there.
---
It's worth noting why the Assault Rifle looks so ridiculous, it's an attempt to apply the same styling of the 10mm Pistol to a machine gun. They're both U.S. military weapons are of relatively new designs whereas the "real world" weapons seen are treated like antiquities. 
---
Fallout also takes place in an alternate universe entirely, there's an entire fake history that's different to our own. As for specific differences between games, that's just because game design leans towards expanding player options in new games which creates problems with prequels. You get it every, it's why games often have "oh no the protagonist just lost his powers" plots at the start in an attempt to avoid running into this. Instead Bethesda just ignored it entirely.
---
Oh heavy weapons is a blast! No sneaking, just run in screaming while laying down death,lol
---
Yep, I'm delighted that the ammo converter is fairly easy to get. There's a few other things that I quite like the look of on the run up to level 20 which I'll hopefully be able to get as well, but the ammo converter was the big one.
---
I know.. I collected loads of toilet rolls to put in my display case...I didn't want to do what every else does and poor teddies in them.. and I scrapped them by mistake.  üò•
---
Would be amazing I thought it would be great after doing the questline thinking there would be something repeatable there and much to my disappointment there's nothing.
---
I didn't get one, but apparently it's similar to the mistress of mistress gear where you have the low lv one and use it to craft the upgraded one. That's what I heard at least.
---
I doubt it will work on Fixer. And if it does, it will bug out and remove the special effects from your Fixer.
---
Yeah...if you disregard that one owns the other, sure.
---
It's the last event in a side quest questline. You need to finish the quest. Or wait for someone to finish the quest to start the Public Event. It's not common, but not rare either. It's called Encryptid.
---
First one is free. To do it again, you need to buy the quest item for \~2000 Caps
---
Well, I guess adding as much protection via card perks to Berserkers like Barbarian, Evasive, Blocker, Adamatium, and serendipity.
---
200h? Where does this number come from?
---
So it's worth it to run Core Assembly over Emergency Protocols?
---
Well good news is eating and drinking is going away =)
---
I am so going to cry over FREE items I get... Now I don't get FREE 6000 but only FREE 1500. What I am only going to do now. :'( I am going to start a war and make a petition against Bethesda. 
---
Bethesda you messed up!!! UwU
---
Thanks, I didn't know that. I'll definitely be paying them a visit.
---
For no reason other than role playing, I've wanted to collect dog tags.  And after reading your post, i want yo collect a few other things too...
---
I do miss dogmeat...
---
As long as they don't bring in Preston garveys great great grandad as a companion.... "some settlers are in need of help" , "i think we can really make it someday" , "I'm gay I like walking with you"
---
(I have nothing against gay people btw)
---
How am I only just finding this out after over a year?  Thank you!
---
If you are bloodied, then run EP, otherwise CA I think is a better choice.
---
I switched from bloodied to Junkies about 400 hrs ago and never looked back, EP was awesome for bloodied but the extra AP running as a Junkies is much much better.
---
Thanks, I reread the post and I missed the point about durability. I only wanted to clarify that even with marsupial deducting Int you could still swap out cards for crafting.
---
Going to agree to disagree with you here Berserker's isn't terrible, As it's as viable as any other build an even more fun.
---
Lacking "Extra" legendary effects isn't as limiting as you might think, In fact it's freeing! It removes that *grind* for the perfect armor and all you need is a hazmat suit if the situation requires it.
---
I've done Commando,Stealth Commando, PA Heavy weapons, Shotgunner,2H Melee and Berserker's By Far my favorite of all these builds.
---
?
---
I like the reference he made with the Paddle Bass, as it‚Äôs abbreviation is PB and that‚Äôs the atomic number for the Fibonacci sequence
---
And yet there exist gaming companies like EA, Bethesda, blizzard activision and others that are blatantly and openly engaging in practices that are openly blatantly aimed at psychologically vulnerable people, and then lie about it to government regulatory boards
---
Taking a break from the game until they add a trade window. Its inexcusable. Diablo 2 LOD came out 2001 and had this.
---
This is a fantastic service, thank you for doing it, so I hope you don't take it the wrong way when I say I Bethesda should come to their senses and make it unnecessary.
---
Dude, you've been proven wrong. Utterly wrong, and you're ramping it up to seemingly feed your ego.
---
Everyone else takes it waaaay too serious, yet you're the one here who is arguing incorrect nonsense.
---
That ego is going to do nothing good for you, friend.
---
Time to shower and use soap lol

Awesome job man! Mines are all the weird stuff, teddy bear smoking a cig and cooking sausages, a skeleton in fetal position thumb in mouth holding a toy rocketship ect :)

I have one that I can craft.  I used it once with my ultracite pa. I'm on Xbox btw
---
I'm breathtaking smile
---
Ok please feel free to DM me the name of the player who spends $120 to unlock the entire season.
---
I find that occasionally things just drop dead. Literally nothing happening and just BLEH onto the floor. üòÖ
---
Yeah I pretty much quit before when the content was dry and trading with randoms was so hard because you don‚Äôt trust each other and you don‚Äôt even trust couriers because there was nobody that‚Äôs 100% trustworthy. I started playing again around 2 months ago and the same issues were still there, only difference was that now there was a legit quest and human (friendly) NPC‚Äôs were added. Also caps limit is so dumb. I‚Äôm pretty much laughing at how some people have over 20 characters (with alt accounts obviously) and they are all max caps, then to do trades they literally have to risk getting scammed because nobody can hold all those caps on one character, it‚Äôs just a bunch of mules ‚Äî&gt; mules trading.
---
This isn‚Äôt a battle pass. 
---
I am asking who is actually going to spend $120 to buy **all** of the rewards? You unlock score through xp. Someone who buys all 15,000 atoms means they don‚Äôt play the game at all.
---
&gt;imagine if I offered respectable reskins for all the weapons?
---
Totally this. More and better weapon skins are the number one thing I see requested and yet the offerings for skins is very weak and limited. If they really want to move atoms, decent skins for all weapons is the way to go.
---
Text chat? It‚Äôs on literally every multiplayer game regardless of genre, not having it just alienate a disabled players
---
Not sure if anyone else is having the same problem but when I go to a vendor I can't see the item he has for sale does not matter whether it is a weapon or clothing but when I go into my own stash etc I can see the item?????????
---
In what way have i been proven wrong? The only 3 arguments i see are:
---
1. Mods says it's ok to post here
---
2. His creations are relevant in 76
---
3. Overser before wastelanders was not a physical character either. 
---
The problem with those arguments are that none of them makes him relevant as an individual character in 76, because he's not even a part of anything major. He is simply mentioned on a terminal. It's something they could have left out without affecting the game in any way.
---
Aye, wood is the best way to go, I did some testing with level 1 wood armor and it didn't affect the build broken or fully repaired *But* it took forever and a crap load of stims just to get it all to break...needless to say I ditched the armor after testing,lol
---
You don‚Äôt need to grind though... you get score just from playing. Again... missing the entire point. The only person who would need to spend $120 is someone who doesn‚Äôt even play the game at all
---
Indeed. The reason the atomic store hasn‚Äôt done as well for Bethesda as they‚Äôd hoped is that the content is sparse and mediocre. They put time limits on the few items which would be consistent sellers, then we never see them again for sometimes approaching a year. I get that the game is an MVP, but you cannot take that strategy with the one aspect you were relying on to give you a consistent income! 
---
Of course, Bethesda‚Äôs response hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äòwe need to up our game with the atomic store,‚Äô but rather ‚Äòwe need to gut the daily and weekly challenge atom income, and introduce more ways for people to spend them.‚Äô Saying that, though, I suspect the atomic store will hit a higher gear once we‚Äôre limited to 1500 atoms per season. A fair amount of the garbled output on the store is due to incompetence, but they‚Äôre definitely holding some (probably a lot) of the juicy stuff back for when it can make them the most profit.
---
On the smaller hand, it's kinda neat, something to dump all the .38 rounds into now, on the bigger hand though....it kinda still takes away from the feeling of this being more of a wasteland or a Fallout game.
---
It felt nice to actually craft my ammo. I would have rather they just give us the chance ti dismantle our fucking ammo instead of throwing it into a machine that magically gives us little BULLET POINTS and then we beep boop and produce other things. 
---
I don' tknow, the beginning and end is the same, i just wish it felt more like a Fallout game and less like...an arcade.
---
Wow,  Those are great pictures you have there.  Keep it up!
---
Hey fella have you been watching me play?
---
They are the regular condos the OP is referring to. I wondered this myself.
---
3 is currently the highest.
---
No greater challenge in a multiplayer game than to try to take it solo. Good luck mate, you got this! üëç
---
Have they hinted at higher stars?
---
You guys do understand that you can still earn free atoms from world challenges, they didn't completely remove them.
---
Do y'all hear yourselves??? I no toddlers that cry less than yall. Everyone wants new content and everyone wants it to be free content, how do you expect to get that free content? by people paying for subs and atoms that's how. 
---
Is starbucks greedy cuz they make you pay for coffee? is Netflix greedy for charging for a sub? Nope this is how capitalism works every where in the world so why is it greedy for Bathesda to do it. If you dont wanna play the game then dont but take your my tit out your mouth and quit bitchen
---
You should drop iron clad anyway. Its a waste of points
---
Only in so far as putting a couple of extra blank ones in there.
---
Over 2 months later.. :(
---
This has been a bug for a while. Mobs just drop dead in an area. It's particularly noticeable in places like the Whitespring.
---
Good luck man, hope you have a peaceful kiddo, for plenty of game time. üëç
---
If they came forward and said: look guys we aren't earning enough money to continue to support the game through the ATOM store. We want to add utility items to boost atom sales, what do you think? I'd be willing to bet we would have been a lot more open to the idea, fans might even have bought more atoms to help support the game. Over at the no man's sky sub people are buying  extra copies of the game to show support after all the effort they put in to fix the game.
---
The confetti are some of my favorite (rugs). I love just layering them and making the floor look completely speckled
---
Agreed!  But don't stop at junk!  Let us lock and protect any item we want!  There is no excuse as to why this isn't already a feature in a 2020 MORPG
---
For my Junkie char I go with Daddy-O, Day Tripper, Med-X, Mentats &amp; Psycho.  
---
-2 CHA, -1 the rest, and -20DR.  
---
I offset this with Herd Mentality, but that's only viable with groups.  I think Herd Mentality might be more relevant with public groups coming in Patch 20.
---
Because we now get cosmetics and stuff you would previously buy with items directly without needing spend a single atom. That‚Äôs why.
---
Agreed. The arena was the most excited in the trailer. Was hugely bummed when it was a 1 time thing. I want hoard mode so bad
---
With just 27 ammo i dont know how would i keep a gauss minigun fed (still dont have plans for it) compared to my 50 cal which makes batches of 180 (currently sitting on 6k). I also have an ultracite gatling for generic mobs to save the rest for much tougher mobs like the SBQ
---
Yeah getting a bit silly now.
---
If this is your first kid, it will definitely blow things up for the first couple months lol. I actually was able to play a decent amount when mine was around 3-9 months old. This was all pre-covid though. Now have 2 kids and have to wait until everyone is in bed which is never.
---
Yea if you want a crappy battle royale and not an open world morpg. Sure
---
If you don't get around to farming it, I personally never farmed it but found that I got plenty of it as rewards from events and ended up building it just from those rewards. üëç Good luck!
---
I think i remember hearing or reading somewhere, that nuclear winter takes place sometime in the future and the firestorm is the result of us using the nukes the way we do. Might explain why we never heard of all of this happening in the other games. Because it was all wiped out.
---
Sometimes when its nice and sunny, I'll quickly travel around to some places im yet to photograph
---
that's the point... they own them, they make their rules, they decide who does what, so any decisions by bethesda are zenimax decisions and any decisions zenimax makes are bethesda decisions
---
 I think you're being too hard on them. I love the rewards they're giving out. Yeah there's an easy out at tier 5 for ammo converter but the rest of the rewards look sick. But ofc it's a grind for them.
---
I placed the Fasnacht confetti pile over trees in the way. Unfortunately if it's a really big tree it might not work.
---
They did. In the fallout first announcement
---
Just drop the link in the text field and it shows it automatically
---
It would be good if the blank ones were some random effects.  Like, every time you kill a dog gain 10 caps, or if you open a fridge your character does a dance.
---
Thxx i accidentally pit it in the web link
---
There's no official update, but you can reliably buy gold between 8pm EST on Saturday up until the point where the weekly atom challenges refresh.
---
How would they make money to continue to support the game if people aren‚Äôt buying atoms?
---
Come again?
---
Cheers buddy, much appreciated
---
Bethesda is more into macrotransactions.
---
 Gong away? They're not getting rid of it are they?
---
Could we technically save these and add them to our screenshot folder, or is that not how the game works?
---
I bought dense mod and the jet pack not knowing they took the same mod slot. That was a sad day.
---
Cheers buddy, much appreciated. This build is kinda close to what I'm moving away from, I do like it but I'm finding I'm using the rifle too much when I want to use a pistol. I figured I'd just eliminate the rifle perks from the build, use those points for other things for survivability.
---
Why are people always omitting the Solar Armor? Paired with sunkissed (and that upcoming legendary per) you‚Äôre always topped off. Imo it‚Äôs the best armor you can have as a full health build - especially with the Vanguard effect.
---
Are owl nuggets real?
---
There is no desire sensor mechanic.  It is RNG, plain and simple, It took me about 70 ish pieces to roll a decent enough sentinels set, some pieces aren‚Äôt perfect but it‚Äôs something I work on as I build up scrip.
---
Thank you!
---
You can any image to the screenshot folder and the game will show it during loading.
---
I think it's great that you've played their challenge and atom system for so long to build up 27,000 atoms; it is factually a testament to your dedication to this game to have achieved that legitimately from logging in every day.
---
But with that being said, more casual players (like myself) shouldn't be punished from here on out with less opportunities for Atoms. I know that mathematically I could have bought most of the Atom shop content I had even a modicum of desire for based on their previous sales (having played since launch).
---
If you had the chance to get nearly 0.70c a day for a year; then when that ends, how is that fair to both new players and existing members of the community who chose to enjoy different aspects of the game, or perhaps enjoy different games entirely? Bethesda and Fallout 76 shouldn't have a monopoly on your daily time. Furthermore, it seems especially harsh to players who maybe wish they had been able to play more everyday, but couldn't because of career or family obligations. Previous Fallout games, being single player, weren't as limiting in those last two aspects and were much more forgiving with player time; with dedication to the game being something that you could build more on your own time.
---
Yeah they are taking the requirements to eat and drink away.  So if you want to eat and drink for bonuses that is fine.  However, you don't have to eat and drink.
---
Yeah because it's dishonest and exposed them for lying to us about storage issues. They created a problem and sold the solution, dishonest publisher/developer tactics 101.
---
I never saw the announcement only articles about it. I somehow completely missed it, and haven't seen it mentioned here either. So people just assumed they were lying and greedy when they said they needed money to support the game.
---
This exactly.
---
Oh heck yeah! OP, do you mind if I steal?
---
Go nuts!
---
I legit fear for the state of Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI.
---
theres actually only 1 armor skin and 1 PA skin, you just have to unlock then on each armor type, PA type seperatly....
---
thats just bad
---
I have never once felt the need to spend actual money on the Atom Store to get something I really wanted because 99% of the stuff I see is goofy meme shit and low quality skins.
---
&gt;Wow, so sorry I happened to post a similarly themed thread roughly thirteen hours ago that was explaining an entirely different aspect of this shit.
---
Umm...
---
[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfqczb/a_few_things_to_consider_before_complaining_about/)
---
&gt;People are going to complain though that this entire system is just designed to give us fewer free atoms and eventually force people to be more likely to buy atoms for cash and... yea, they're exactly right
---
This post
---
&gt;Reducing the number of free atoms people can earn and thus hoard is something that has been drastically overdue in this game in order to incentivize people into actually eventually buying atoms. Free atoms were supposed to supplement our purchases of atoms, not entirely replace them.
---
Entirely different aspect huh...? Ok
---
Wow, I didn't think it was possible to simp this hard for Bethesda. 
---
Just think for a moment how sad it is to have your community have to prop you up because you can't even earn enough money to keep your game going.
---
What's sadder is that you have absolutely no idea how much money Bethesda is or isn't making. They could be doing very poorly, or, as a leaker known to be pretty accurate for their leaks, said of Fallout 1st that "[the overall subscription sales have been excellent](https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/11/no-fallout-1st-players-arent-getting.html?showComment=1573006981806#c8262296785547955376)".
---
But, you know, Bethesda, a multi billion dollar company, desperately needs the money.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gnzdou/does_anyone_know_whats_up_with_the_alien_henge/
---
I was going to say the same thing, I have like 50 glowing and hardened mass and zero high rad fluids. The gauss mini guzzles ultracite ammo so I spend half my time playing in the nuke zone trying to find it
---
Oh yes please
---
He keeps hearing the same 10 songs out of the 50 there are.
---
Actual fixes don't make money, please look forward to the next Atom Store update though.
---
You can buy the plan from Phoenix the vendor in Watoga
---
Find a new game that interests you
---
Yeah it's pretty much just bad luck and bad randomisation on the radio. I rarely hear more than the usual ones.
---
I just listen to my own music now, it makes more sense.
---
Maybe they'd get more revenue if they put out stuff worth actually paying for and not throwaway meme trash.
---
When you fast travel to some location. Close your eyes and try to navigate by ear and muscle memory only, when trying to get to the point you need to go. Yes, this is how boring the game is people.
---
I have the power armor helmet but it‚Äôs level 15, I need that upgrade stat
---
People by and large don't like being told the thing they like is shit.
---
(even more so when it is actually shit)

Like you saw this daily show thingy where a guy asks trump supporters about trump and blocking witnesses but phrases it like trump would never do such a thing and you get this wonderful it of doublethink going on when the ball drops [https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1226264916258107393/photo/1](https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1226264916258107393/photo/1)

Goat legs perk card helps avoid that.

Id have to take pictures and show you details later tonight if my description isn't good enough.
---
But the pleasant Valley ski resort has two (building with vendor bot and keycard door in basement), one is behind the lobby desk on a conveyer belt, the other is in an office on a shelf with a hot plate. The office is across the hall from vendor bot.
---
From there head north west, there is a building with a pool table in the 2nd floor and a bus out front to the east, just north of this building is a boat in the road, one is in the boat with a dead body.
---
Standing in the boat, face west, drop down the small cliff (there are 3 buildings in a semi circle here with a BBQ area in the middle), there is a metal shelf at the bottom of the cliff half sunk in the ground, one is on this shelf.
---
Go south, there's a alley with raider shops, going south down this ally looking on the left side, you'll see metal shelves about half way down, the last stealtjboy is on the bottom shelf next to a green footlocker. There are two dead bodies right next to this shelf if you are having trouble spotting it.
---
This is how I gather them, it just seems to be the quickest route
---
Yeah, even if i don't change server i would still got the same songs. The problem of your own music is that when you speak to someone you can't listen so much of what they say.
---
blast mines seems to be the only way to reset him
---
That's a bit crap.  I like the survivability kind of thing that eating and drinking brings.  Makes it more realistic.
---
I would assume BoS stuff gonna come with the BoS storyline.
---
used the floor w/concrete that can sink into the ground... or just a doormat
---
Lol.. Hate to see a two shot explosive.
---
I run Spotify on the Playstation and use subtitles, so when it's a non important random talking, I still see what they said, and the important convos are a quick 2 button presses and I can pause what music I'm listening to. üëç
---
I think it‚Äôs because the flat 40% damage reduction of power armor outperforms DR, so even vanguard conventional armor can‚Äôt really compete.  
---
Try going to Westek with a vanguard suit, even step it up to secret service armor, then repeat with a basic excavator suit.  You‚Äôll take so much less damage in power armor.
---
rare but noob and weak
---
What? What is this?
---
Turn it off and watch some tv
---
dont understand how it does not destroy camps, i always go over to random camps in the forest and drop artillery smoke grenade to see them freak out
---
If you are on PC there is a mod for that on Nexus.
---
I have the same username on Xbox...you?
---
Build up the best Base in history, make a new character, go help some low lvls out and of course you have to infamous grind for xp, legendaries and rare outfits, plans etc. Thats about it i think
---
nope, just spend it
---
I got the same one but with sentinel effect instead of blocking... On my first ever roll. Too bad i don't use chameleon and can't trade/store it to my alts. Most likely have to scrip it eventually.
---
Other developers do such much more without needing to cut off the player's ability to buy stuff with "premium" currency. Battlefront 2 could do it since launch and that game was one of the biggest controversies in recent gaming history. We're allowed to be disappointed considering the game has half the content of other games that have been out as long and yet they still are removing things to do despite the already poorly made end game.
---
It's okay to like the game, but mindlessly defending it for no reason is stupid. People are not whining babies because they have standards and it's perfectly fine to complain about free content, especially when the game has less frequent content than ACTUAL free games and yet you still had to pay full price at launch.
---
If they're going to go to trouble of doing that they might as well raise the limit. It's essentially the same thing.
---
I suggested this about a week ago, it did not go down well!
---
I always suggest stocking up on masses and fluids first.  Nothing more annoying than watching a bunch of raw flux spoil in your inventory while you frantically try and hunt down the 5 high rad fluids you need to craft everything.
---
They also crunch their employees pretty bad all things considered as well CDPR make some great games but some of the methods to get them there may be a little suspect.
---
I‚Äôve been contemplating buying this for a few days, it looks so clean compared to my brick house. I love how the porches and railings look, wasteland luxury lol
---
27k atoms? üòÆ How long have you been playing? Are you actively hunting atoms? I have f1st, so I guess I'm buying atoms.
---
I run a PA heavy in excavator - I know all that. But I also run a solar stealth archer. My point wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúvangurd b best‚Äù but ‚Äúwhy does everyone want thorn instead of solar‚Äù? Melee enemies aren‚Äôt really dangerous and the sneak increase sounds pretty lackluster compared to 4hp regen per second for you and nearby teammates. Plus, if your teammate also runs solar, it stacks. 3 clustered solar people would be like contant stimpaks for everyone involved.
---
If they raise the cap limit, sellers will raise their prices. Inflation will be inevitable.

Mods or a bullet.

Go on to nukes and dragons perk planner. It lists all the negative effects of various addictions on the same page. Choose whichever will be lease detrimental to your playstyle!

Oh... What were their arguments?
---
Oh here it is... People are not a fan it seems... Guess I'll remove the post.
---
You mean the two defining Russian national traits?
---
I stop playing.
---
I always see this complaint and sometimes wonder if it's based on account or character or something.  I get a ton of fluids...and end up not being able to get any glowing mass.
---
Yea this is literally the 30th+ piece I've roll without unyielding over the last 3 weeks, but this roll makes up for it since I can just use it with my pre-wastelanders armor, I was really shooting for that blocking effect and was stunned with the results.
---
Don't play the game? That's what I normally do with a thing I'm bored with - stop doing it.
---
An amazing collection!
---
I've been doing the same and it makes the game feel so much more personal, especially with them as the load screens.
---
Glad to see there are other Post-Apocalyptic Photographers out there. üòÅ
---
Try to gather some sort of collection.weapon,armor,...
---
You used to be able to place as many as you wanted. I have 4 and refuse to ever move my camp out of fear of losing them.
---
It's suppose to take 100 hours to reach rank 100. People who work full time jobs won't be able to hit that mark because it's more than an hour of playing every single day for those 10 weeks.
---
I don‚Äòt think that‚Äòs an issue since servers are the same for steam and beth launcher!? Correct me if i‚Äòm wrong here...
---
Things like '2 limits to worry about' 'there is a reason for the cap' 'I have never had more than 6k caps' etc
---
Nukashine Dreamwalking, little thing that's been trying to figure out. Not everywhere, not even everytime, The Blue haze is the normal, then suddenly a weird red/yellow/black tone (Like Pickman's Paintings from Fo4), then weird stuff
---
Fus Ro Dah
---
Thank youu and yea I've started to take up photography and in game it's really suprising the quality of pics you can take
---
Good luck out there!
---
I understand that. I doubt I will be able to get there as well. My point is nobody is going to pay $120 and skip every single level. I fully expect people to skip some levels.
---
It's a shame, I actually still think it's a good idea, ahwell!
---
Maybe a lock on the vendor, that you can toggle on or off. So you don't oversell.
---
Especially when you give it more than 2 seconds. A surprising amount of options for editing.
---
OH, thats cool! Thanks for The info man. Ill definately try that
---
Owl_No is my psn
---
Hi guys, Is it ok to ask for specific plans on here? After anything Gauss rifle to buy/swap! On XBox One, also willing to contribute any plans to the XBox mule if there happens to be any I have and they don‚Äôt.
---
I'm the opposite. Got unyielding 3* first, bolstering 3* second. Only used the unyielding for a while because it had 20% ammo weight reduction and it helped to bring me just under overencumbered during fasnacht.
---
How does it compare to T60 and X01? I use power armor quite a bit but I‚Äôm not sure if I want to start that grind after my SS armor
---
I signed in one day after taking like a month off and all my pictures were deleted. Made me very very sad cause that was one of my main features and killed my drive to continue playing sadly
---
Do you have a list somewhere of what is still needed on Xbox?
---
Yea i gotta admit taking the picture of the nuke as it went off at the whitespring was really fun
---
Dive deep into some of the random lore of the game. Whether that be ingame or some YouTube videos. I personally really enjoyed learning about the cryptids and where they came from, what the original story is and wmhow that story cake across into 76.
---
Most videogames haven't had microtransactions for years, it's all about them macrotransactions
---
Yeah, I think so too!
---
Wish someone would give me 4k.
---
No one here is mindlessly defending anything what there using is a standard business model that has been around for a while now let's get that straight first. Second if you have such high standards just go play COD like every other bandwagon jackoff. And third did I hear you right that it  PERFECTLY OK to complain about somthing free, I retract my statement about taking your mom's tit outta your mouth cuz obviously you did have one or at least she didn't raise you right
---
I have pictures of friends that have forgotten me

I've got one off the balcony of my camp, overlooking the forest while a nuke went off. Looks super surreal seeing something so devastating "so close to home". It's so nice playing with the photomode during all the chaos that is 76.
---
Because free atoms cut into their profits.. a real company would remove atoms completely and just add customization to the game.. but no.
---
My suggestion if they make the game less fun to play its simple. No longer play.
---
I dont follow that sub reddit
---
Storage is difficult for things like weapons and armor that do not stack because each piece of equipment has a unique identifier. Storage is trivial for things that do stack as there's a simple identifier for the item and then just a quantity.  So with fall out first they took the simple to do storage and made it unlimited which added very little overhead to the system.
---
With that side I'm more than fine paying $100 per year for this game. I have over a thousand hours in and it's literally the only game I have purchased since it came out so in the long run I've definitely got my money's worth even with the subscription cost.
---
Yea the picture with the whitespring nuke was taken just over my balcony on my base which is a cliffsidr camp

This is Bethesda, remember? They'll lower the atoms gained, but not remove the kits and fo1 perks. 
---
However, I personally would be more then happy to sacrifice daily/weekly atoms for a free scrapbox and a rational caps limit.
---
Agree, I'm sitting on 10k and rarely purchase. Most of my favourite skins have come from nuc. Winter.
---
I only have only used  F. 1st for 2 months. I'm just an Atom collector!!!
---
You're gatekeeping that dude's experience. People are different. Overcome.
---
They aren't free.. We paid for the game.
---
I just changed the name of mine so it's always at the very top it's not as safe as an atom skin but at least I no when I start geting to the top of the list it time to be careful
---
It will probably apply automatically.  
---
The Fixer \*is\* actually a combat rifle with a special mod and special name.  
---
Besides all combatrifle mods are compatible already with  the fixer.
---
Yeah, the dwindling player numbers clearly show it.
---
Sorry for necroposting, but isn't our hardware's fault. Bought it just 4 hours ago due to steam's summer sales,and so far, 5-6 times instantly crashed to desktop. Be it on character creation, entering name, or using sculpt. 
---
Even viewer logs:
---
*''Faulting application name: Fallout76.exe, version:* *1.3.1.34**, time stamp: 0x5eceb978*
---
*Faulting module name: Fallout76.exe, version:* *1.3.1.34**, time stamp: 0x5eceb978*
---
*Exception code: 0xc0000005*
---
*Fault offset: 0x0000000002d1ce3a''*
---
It might have as excode ''*0xc0000005*'', but i'm 100% sure it's F76 engine that causes crashes. Steam discussion lot of posts with same problem. I play everything else maxed out 1440p+, and not a single crash. RDR2 over 200h, not a single crash. It's just old good Bethesda games, same as Skyrim &amp; Fallout 4.  I just asked for a refund, for my own inner peace.
---
Not trying to be rude but could there be a reason customers aren't doing events and stopping playing?
---
For me it's hit or miss.  Some weeks good, some weeks nothing.  I've also bought 2000 caps worth, gone back the next day and he won't sell the rest for that week.  He is a terribly buggy npc.  Just like ward and blackeye.  Weird they haven't really addressed many of the blatent wastelander bugs.
---
Borderlands 3 just had its third full length DLC released today. If you like FPS looters, maybe try it. I'll be playing it this weekend.
---
Guys, you are incredible!
---
A character from an ACTUAL Fallout game
---
I was underwhelmed too. I was hoping for more tactical stuff... Not some astronaut PA skin.
---
I try it, but BL2 is so much better
---
The servers might be the same when it comes to who you are seeing in game, but Steam's player count definitely does not include Bethesda.net users, it is specifically the number of people currently running Fallout76.exe from the Steam client. If the PTS still requires using Bethesda.net, I guess that probably does not help either, early access to upcoming patches in a period of content drought might be a good incentive to switch (back) from Steam.
---
If you go to the bethesda website you could see that the fast travel bug as well as many others, is gettin a fix on patch 20.
---
...source? I could've sworn it only took them a couple days - initial announcement was on a Thursday, clarification was the following Monday or Tuesday? It's still a bit questionably longer than it should've been, but not -weeks-...
---
Basically the circles of slaughter from borderlands. Some of the most played endgame content those ages have. Fallout 76 could definitely use something like that
---
I don't buy the atom camp items I want because my budget is full. I built a lovely 2 story house with a porch and workshop, everything I need, pretty af. Took me hours. *Hours*. And now I cannot put ANYTHING else in it so I don't bother getting excited about whatevers in the atom store.
---
I'm sorry, what? I've never seen an actual player condemn and complain about the Atomic Shop monetization. Most of the time it's a person who doesn't even own the game and was spoodfed information by game journalists. A screenie or two of the challenges tab is enough to shut them up.
---
What Bethesda is greedy about are the stash and currency limits.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs because unyielding provides such a substantial bonus that it‚Äôs unquestionably the most popular stealth build.  There‚Äôs a good reason it‚Äôs the meta, like it or not.
---
Given that solar and unyielding are like oil and water, it‚Äôs just not popular.  You don‚Äôt really need regeneration when you only get spotted once a week.  I could care less about the thorn damage, but getting a freebie harder to detect set bonus makes it a pretty obvious choice for a stealth build.  That means I can add in another sentinel effect, some kind of weight reduction, or whatever.
---
If solar works for you, that‚Äôs fantastic.  I guess myself and many other players just don‚Äôt see it as the best option for conventional armor.  Maybe it‚Äôll gain traction after a balance pass, if unyielding gets a hard nerf, or if there‚Äôs a reason to need more than 19% health to get through future content.
---
Never played borderlands but it would give a good thing for endgame players to grind out and a good thing for lower levels to get xp
---
Most bases I go to are decked out in atom store stuff, just like mine. I think you are an outlier in this, and that‚Äôs okay!
---
Heck 8/10 bases have a scrap box which indicates they have had FO1st at some point, like myself.
---
When I get bored I usually hop on TF2 or FO4.
---
Well thanks for the advices.ü§ù
---
Nope it would overload servers as some bitches in this community would say
---
Yeah good luck, have fun!
---
Generally the different power armor suits are not that much different unfortunately.  [This guy did some testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPu8f4DMo3M) and it's only a marginal increase over excavator.
---
The big impact PA has is the (hidden) damage reduction %, where a full suit reduces all damage by like 40%-50%.
---
It's true, but its fun for 1 run through, end game is shite tho. Not worth the money if you are on a budget probably
---
&gt; 1500 atoms was previously obtainable every 2 weeks or so, now we earn it every 3 months and that is under the assumption we complete the pass
---
Only if you include non repeatable challenges, because 500 is about what you can get with those reoccurring (weekly/daily) ones.
---
There's a big difference between unlimited stash storage and unlimited junk storage from a database point of view.
---
Unlimited junk storage is a fixed list of components, with only the number of each type being tracked, whereas with stash storage it can have any type of item stored and has to keep track of lots of variables.
---
Unlimited stash storage would be a problem for the servers, particularly if people started storing hundreds or thousands of legendaries for scrip or whatever. Server loading times when your character is initially loaded onto the server from the main database would become a lengthy process and potentially become a major network issue so it definitely makes sense to limit stash size.
---
The only valid argument to made about it is why isn't unlimited junk storage available to everyone but then they wouldn't get that fallout 1st income and running servers isn't cheap.
---
It‚Äôs not infinite storage believe me. Even with the scrap box I struggle with stash space. 800 lbs is ridiculous.
---
yes, delete her chair and choose someone better.
---
If you find yourself wanting a fast paced looter shooter in the future you could do a lot worse than Borderlands 2/3. They‚Äôre fun. Best fun with friends though.
---
The assumption is that swapping ATOM for SCORE will lower the overall rewards, but I think it might be confusing the issue with Bethesda statement  ‚Äúoverall, less ATOM up for grabs‚Äù. 
---
It sounds like the rewards might be more predetermined so it all depends on your POV. 
---
It sounds like they are taking away my choice of what reward I will receive for my grinding. If I earn less ATOM over time all then my reward is actually whatever Season decides based on the ranks. Right now if I do some lifetime challenges and daily/weekly then I got pick what I want to buy.
---
The said the are keeping the lifetime challenges so it‚Äôs probably daily and weekly that are going away?
---
I‚Äôm skeptical that SCORE will provide the equivalent value I received playing with ATOM for the last 6 months or so and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to expect the value I received in the past from a game I purchased on Xbox and Steam.
---
I love this game but I got trust issues with Bethesda. That said, I‚Äôm excited for seasons.
---
oh don't worry as there will always be TES V! Everywhere!

---
nothing like the smell of a roaring camp fire to wake you up in the morning, if you cannot start one yourself, then store bought is fine.
---
Western Revolver and .44 need to have interchangeable skins as well.
---
&gt;othing in the shop I'd ever want to spend real money on. Too much goofy shit.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Also, it's not at all the consumer's problem if they make money or not. Bethesda's entire job is to convince us to shell over money. It's not the player's problem if they fail at that.
---
Another Icelandic wastelander?  just going by your name

I might look into the new one that came out as it looked alright

definitely not weeks it was days youre totally right

Don't forget the sink!
---
It's a joke but Zenimax has drifted so far into the pure greed territory that part of me wonders if Skyrim and Fallout 4 are the last games we'll have with open modding. The Creation Club was tacked onto them but no doubt Starfield/ESVI will be made with it in mind and I wonder how they'll make life difficult for open modding.
---
2 has the better story. 3 has the best gameplay hands down (if a little laggy in menus for some reason)
---
It's virtue signaling how much of a fan he is of the game. This happens every time there are complaints against the game. These, "you should take what you're getting and like it" posts invariably come up as a response from people who bend over backwards for Bethesda.
---
These people live in this sheltered reality where the game truly is a piece of mastery and the mountain of criticism and bad reviews it has received are a conspiracy of bitter people. If you want to see how businesses get away with bad practices, these people are why.
---
Really !?
---
I think 2 definitely is on game pass so I might check it out not sure if 3 is
---
I cannot disagree with any of what you have written :)
---
They rotate because they want you to come back everyday because at its core they want this game to have a community even though a lot play solo.
---
I agree 100 a year too much for what you get, need to buff.
---
T-65 has the highest ballistic and energy protection of all PAs

---
Yeah that sucks man, I would help craft anything you need but that helmet as you say is the thing not easily replaced.  I actually never got it to drop, not most of the rares...
---
People have entwined their identity and emotions into this game as a reaction to their enjoying something which receives criticism. Sadly you'll see the same thing where a partner is accused of sexually harassing someone else, or something in that vein, the accused's partner will double down in defense rather than facing the horrible reality.
---
It is both sad and pathetic.
---
Who is this dude you refer to spending $120 to skip the entire season for a game they don‚Äôt play?
---
Those are god awful "Arguments" if you can call them that.
---
When he bugs out and gives you the silent treatment, try logging out the game going  back in the Wayward and just opening dialogue with the Duchess, back out the dialogue then speak to smiley, seems to work for me when he bugs out.
---
Also if you buy on sunday, within 24hrs of the reset, he never bugs out.
---
I suspect anyone trying to buy missiles will send an immediate alert to the player's next of kin &amp; social worker (gaming support division). They're clearly on the wrong meds
---
The queen's landing trigger is proximity based. You need to be underneath her at a particular point of her cycle for her to land and engage in melee. She needs a target to land on.
---
A fart attack is a failed target aquisition.
---
Staggering her with tank killer or one gun army disrupts the animation you need for her to aquire a target.
---
I have been landing her for over a year now and I can't believe that after all this time I never see anyone else sprinting to get in position underneath her.
---
That's all well and good, but here's the lazy players guide to the queen fight...
---
1 - Wait for someone to launch a nuke.
---
2 - Stand around and spend all of your ammo shooting at the queen. The queen doesn't do anything other than fly around and occasionally land. When it lands it just stands there. It's really big as well so you'll rarely miss.
---
3 - Shoot the other things that show up.
---
4 - You get a reward. As long as the current version hasn't regressed older bugs (60/40) you can also collect loot off the queen corpse.
---
Link to the build?

u/a_sense_of_contrast put it perfectly. After several hours I became glad to play and enjoyed two rounds of Fallout 1st. Hundreds of hours of enjoyable playtime also exposed me to the consistent horrible support from the developer and publisher. It's not just us - this game has been suffering a staggering amount of decreasing playerbase since Wastelanders (source: Steamcharts). I can only imagine what it's like on other platforms as more and better-supported games are released.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try
---
Those two could very well be the last 'good' games that weren't set out on greed completely but I wouldn't be too much worried about modding. They already stated they'll be using the same engine like the last and current titles and we already see how active modding is even in Fo76, even if Beth wanted to prevent modding people would find a way. Beth might have a number of devs in their main studios but modders got years of experience with the engine and its code.
---
Hello! Yes there are. Unfortunately, this is not a plan so it is not on the mule. It is an "auto learn on pick-up" of owlet meat
---
True, I really wanted to use text chat and perk loud out mods, but haven't in fear of beth's ban hammer.
---
Yeah, but again, this isn't our problem.  
---
We have not a single obligation to support the game past our initial purpose.   That they still haven't added basic features expected for a game of this kind and also try to hide basic features behind a premium service is probably more reason for people to forgo supporting them since we're still waiting for a growing list of essentials.
---
If Bethesda wants their game to be profitable, they could start by making a game people actually want.  And if they want people to buy and use Atoms, maybe they should start adding things to the shop most people consider crap, and stop trying to force an artificial scarcity on digital items that have no limit by constantly removing shop items.
---
I wanted the opposite. I wanted a full on Fallout 4 style shack set. Ragged cloth walls, piecemeal wood floors, patch work roofs etc. The wooden set we get in the base game is rustic but it looks too nice for a post atomic wasteland.
---
I always find a tent and make a beeline for it as soon as the rewards pop up on screen, then I stash my flux and run back out to get the XP. I have lost flux too many times by dying at the hands of the last spawn. Find a tent and stash the flux ASAP.

No love for manually operated traps that don't involve build mode?
---
You need to get minimum 1k of damage on her before you can loot her body!
---
FYI this game is supported bij Atom purchases, since content updates are free,
---
and people can earn alot of atoms for free at the moment =&gt; less atom sales for Beth,
---
so they change it up, and replace the daily and weekly free atoms with a season (battlepass whatever) and put some free stuf in it (which nobody asked for) and reduced the amount of free atoms
---
now when people see something in the atom store they like, the will have to purchase atoms 
---
im not saying I support the move, but it is what it is, Beth/Zeni is still a company that has to make money and please its shareholders, the way the word works, nothin is free
---
Yes we know that... the thing is combat rifle skins are not compatible with the fixer so why would this be any different?
---
You again ignore that House exists during the time of 76
---
That House is the founder of Robco, which are present in the game
---
How havent you been proven wrong?
---
Pie is worthless.  I get several a week from clicking on the machines, or you can just climb on the roof of West Tek and pick one up like 75 percent of the time.  Put them in your vending machine and someone will always end up buying it.
---
It's a damn roof pie!!  Thanks for paying 50 caps for it though lol.
---
- Robert House founded RobCo. 
---
- RobCo is integral to Fallout 76. 
---
- There are multiple direct references to Robert House and his plans for the research facilities in Appalachia. 
---
It‚Äôs not just that the robots are there. The Research Facility is there. 
---
Can you tell me *why* House chose to build the research facility there?  
---
You seem to think that House would have to have the same level of importance as the Overseer to be considered relevant. But that‚Äôs simply not the case. 
---
Robert House is connected to Fallout 76, and that‚Äôs the only requirement needed in this sub to qualify under that rule as ‚Äòpost-worthy‚Äô. 
---
***In short; he only needs to be as relevant as the admin &amp; mods require in order to be a legitimate topic.***
---
That‚Äôs the only point of argument here. 
---
Not if he is **as** relevant as the Overseer. Not if he is physically in the game.  Not if he is a topic *better* suited somewhere else. 
---
The only thing that matters is if he qualifies as a legitimate topic here.  And that was positively established hours before you even posted in the first place. 
---
***Tell me this:*** **who gets to decide if the rules of a sub are being followed?**
---
Sad but hilarious
---
You could see it that way, but if they feel the CAP is important not to raise what this does is let us sell knowing we are covered.  I am probably the only 1 but I don‚Äôt Vendor that often as I have a lot of solid weapons and armor that will fetch $5-10k a piece that have built up over a year.  Not armor at that much, but $1-3k for some of those even with SS armor.  If I just put in a couple items for fear of someone buying them all, no one will stop in as I look like I got nothing and why fast travel over.  And yes I know I could throw other weapon junk in there as bait to get the numbers up, but I hate that, so I can‚Äôt do it myself.  I would love to show folks what I got, I have a good price (as I want them to get good homes), but it will be way over $30k.  So instead I don‚Äôt put up a vendor at all....  CAP raise would surely help, but coverage to me would help a great deal more.  Just a thought...
---
Also by your logic everything not in the game/that didn't happen in the game itself is not relevant
---
Why are there so many rads here?
---
Id guess a nuclear war but it didn't happen in the game so I guess not.
---
House is relevant. You continually banging on that he isn't because he isn't in the game is absurd.
---
He's in the canonical lore, and more, he's alive during the time of 76.
---
But please, keep arguing nonsense.
---
No. You are literally losing out on the choice to make purchases with the ‚Äúfree‚Äù atoms it gives you currently for slogging through this mess of a game without anything to do. In exchange for a lot more ‚Äúchores‚Äù with less choice and much less of a personalizes payoff in total. No matter how you slice it, the new model is aimed at cutting away those free atoms you earn and forcing players to spend even more time grinding for crap they probably don‚Äôt want. (I know I don‚Äôt want half of this shit) 
---
Defend it all you want, but you‚Äôre losing choice for perceived ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. and value is subjective, money (atom) is not, it functions the same in the atom shop as it would anywhere else. I am not giving Bethesda anymore money and after a few days checking this‚Äî I‚Äôll decide whether or not to delete this game or not. 
---
Sorry‚Äî no one asked for seasons, we asked for content. Not to be trickle fed rewards for mundane chores, which BOTH systems are guilty of.
---
Some people believe fallout 76 isnt canon
---
If people have thousands of atoms now then they're never gonna buy any in the first place, because there isn't enough interesting stuff in the shop to justify it.
---
Fully agreed. Fix your damn game first, add content later. Fix the UI (especially with vendors), allow us to trade item for item, increase the currency cap, fix the economy (caps have a big currency generator and a small cap sink), remove hacked weapons, fix missing attachments on weapons, fix some attachments having no effect, fix the quest pointers (trade secrets anyone?), make perk descriptions accurate, rebalance the perks, the weapons, and the legendary effects.  
---
That short list of changes above requires NO NEW ASSETS yet sounds much, much more attractive then their entire yearly roadmap.
---
I posted that in the wrong place.
---
It's amusing people think it isn't canon. Bethesda hold the rights, they made it, it's canon /shrug
---
There's a difference between making a profit and ripping people of.
---
Thematically, think of it in a real combat situation: the forces are thrown out in waves and despite the best fighter in the battle being downed, there are still more forces that were yet to be sent out. Seeing their best hope for survival being killed, they lose it, they frenzy, they see red and start attacking everything, they see anything that moves and anything that was in the area, they destroy EVERYTHING in their rage.
---
Or atleast that's how I would imagine it üòÖüëç
---
Most is a bunch of things I would never accept as rewards if I were given the choice. I will never use photo mode, poses , and frames. I will not use stupid af skins that I don't like. The ammo converter is a waste of space that is not worth a sliver of my camp budget. Have you seen the conversation rates , and ammo point costs. 100 points for 3 mini nukes. Almost as many points to buy 20 rounds of 10 mm. Can't even dump mini nukes in one at a time, it takes 3 at a time , means we will be forced to hold the shit ammo for periods of time. That's not helpful , that's another rope around the neck, in a game that already has so many ropes around the neck, scrip limit, cap limit , gold limit , now , you reached 18 pounds of mini nukes , congratulations, exchange these for less 5.56 than I can craft with one click of the button.
---
I dont know why you feel like that person should have as much as somebody who logs in for hours every day. There is no monopoly here, one person simply values the atoms more than another and was willing to do the steps involved to get them. Put the glove on the other hand. Why should the new player or person who only plays for a few hours a week have the stuff as someone who plays everyday for hours on end ? I would be more upset if I did that grind and somebody buys the game, does *something*, then has 27k atoms like the OP ? Yeah no, that's way more unfair
---
I know u posted it in the wrong place but replied so someone did lol
---
If a game can't sustain itself by just being a game then it shouldn't exist. Players have already paid an entry fee. Let's not forget about all the special editions, the microtransactions and the $100 subscription. This isn't about being sustainable. It's about getting more money from the same people. This isn't a free to play game... and with that kind of economy, it should be.
---
Yes, this. I didn't even attempt the get the ghillie suit, even though I would like to have it. BR is just not for me. More options (paths) are always better.
---
Hey. We are going to start a PS4 yes. It might take a while. The XB1 project is almost done
---
Of course you wouldn‚Äôt use solar on a bloodied build. I was referring to everything that is not bloodied. I‚Äôm pretty sure the playerbase isn‚Äôt split entirely between bloodied UNY and full health PA. builds. I can‚Äôt be the only full health build without PA out there, can I?
---
Despite being the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù, bloodied is kinda overrated anyway imo. Damage is good, but it‚Äôs a hassle to maintain and honestly, unyielding + serendipity is borderline cheating in terms of stat bonuses and SPECIAL checks.
---
In fact, from what I can tell everyone hates bloodied players because they instakill everything in events. At least everyone who doesn‚Äôt run bloodied themselves.
---
But yeah, I have some pretty great results with Solar and was just wondering why everyone else seems to dismiss it outright ü§î
---
You bought the game buddy. That's not $0. The greed is on Bethesda's part here.
---
How are you being ripped off when everything since launch has been free content?
---
He does this all over the place it seems. He loves to shift the goalposts. 
---
The rule simply says posts ‚Äòhave something to do with Fallout 76‚Äô. It doesn‚Äôt say that the topic has to be integral to the story or the plot. 
---
By his logic, I can‚Äôt talk about the Bloodleaf plant because it‚Äôs not integral to the plot and could be removed without negatively affecting the game. It could be easily replaced or eliminated so it‚Äôs not ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô.
---
He even admitted that his original statement could have been phrased better, but still wants to argue. He thinks I‚Äôm trying to argue that House and the Overseer are both equally important to Fallout76. And it‚Äôs been amusing watching him try to ‚Äòcounter-argue‚Äô a point I never made or claimed. 
---
He is amusing, though.
---
Not gonna lie, as someone who just a new character and is replaying the game,  lowkey glad.
---
You only pay once for your coffee tho.
---
I would love some Violet flux depending on if you're looking for Caps or not for it. If you're looking for caps unfortunately I am broke, but if you're looking to just give it away I would be thrilled and grateful to take some off of your hands for you

Responsibility rolls up hill. That's like the whole point of power dynamics.
---
So a free box of wet feces sounds appealing, I can break my leg with a hammer for free also, might be a good deal. Free garbage is free garbage, not a reward. Most all these "rewards" as they call them , are the kind of crap I go out of my way to not download in the atom shop. The idea of owning them at all, even for free , is unappealing to me. I would like the season much better if I were at least given the option to politely refuse my rewards. May just be how I am, I really don't like getting anything I don't want.
---
If you convert the Atoms required for the "free" content into actual $$$ you realize that most of it is not worth the asking price. Stuff like the contemporary house kit for example could be cobbled together by a intern in a few hours yet they ask for 1/6th of the cost of the game.
---
His point was that just because this hoarder has plenty of Atoms doesn't mean that they need to change the systems through which you gain atoms, so everyone has that same equal opportunity for getting the same said Atoms the same as the OP. 
---
OP having an exorbitant amount of atoms does not equal everyone having an exorbitant amount of atoms, and thus there is no actual need to reduce the means of gaining Atoms outside of the OPs narrow perspective.
---
Lots of elders out there. Even a few sentinels.
---
We‚Äôre loosing atoms?........REEEEEEEEEEEE lol jk I don‚Äôt really care about atoms XD
---
Anyone making a paedo ranch deserves to get nuked on every server they land on
---
Hey good job with your collection üëè. I have spent 60 USD on atoms.
---
I see her occasionally but the stories she tells are far too long for the minimal rewards. After a while I lumped her with the Insult, Bandit and Lottery random bots and either just run straightnoast or kill for a few xp.
---
I got downvoted into oblivion when I said that when Seasons was first announced. I said they are waiting to see how the public reacts before sticking a price tag on future seasons. Glad to see people finally figuring this out.
---
I can never be arsed to swap them over unless it's a silo run, even with the perk loadout mod installed. 
---
The rewards are hardly worth the effort. Passive versions would be a welcome addition.
---
Some of these options are kinda biased xD
---
I'm level 32, and go out there strictly to run out and make her land. Bonus, I'm nearby when she dies if I survive going toe to toe with her... So actually might grab some loot for all the ammo I'm wasting.
---
Sounds good. I added :)
---
I am a beginner in psychology and some answer intended to be biased. I might have missed some key options.
---
I know it may sound very strange to many of you, I hate getting free stuff that I don't want to own. I hate the idea of it being in my file. I wish there was a way to opt out of seasons. None of the rewards appeal to me. This may be the end of my journey in fo76. 4200 hours. And this weird ass shit is what's making me sick.
---
Hey! We are getting pretty close to completing the XB1 list. Maybe 20-30 plans left. If you want to help, I need to link you up with the XB1 folks. Easiest way is to join the discord. Can you DM me and I will give you a link
---
Get one of those baby backpack things that lets you wear the baby on the front of you. I have played countless hours of games with a baby sleeping in one of those things.
---
You earn ‚Äús.c.o.r.e.‚Äù by completing daily and weekly challenges along with earning xp and public events. It is account wide. S.c.o.r.e. Is used to level up. We don‚Äôt know how much is earned or needed to progress to each level afaik.
---
One last FU from the Queen. I actually think it‚Äôs brilliant, it‚Äôs easy to let your guard down or get caught checking bodies, and then you‚Äôre possibly screwed. Just something to remember, fight to the last creature then celebrate, loot, pillage.
---
People like me had to wait 2 years for this game to get good and not to mention that the economy can never be fixed I find presents between 80-300 every time I play
---
damn those are awesome! mine are all sunsets and skylines with the occasional picture of my character üòÖ
---
Mothman is Life... Our Lord and Savior... Mothman leads us all towards the light... where we will repeatedly bounce off it.
---
Agreed
---
answered. just keep in mind that this is the internet and full of trolls. dont trust the answers you get
---
I go away for a while and comeback something new happens. I also try builds out of my comfort zone. I haven't played melee since Oblivion, not a melee fan. So I tried melee, then bloodied (not a minmaxer fan either) melee, now I have an unarmed bloody melee character. Thinking of doing a "survival" character no magic perks, weapons or armour, only what I think fits the 50's scifi theme.
---
Glad to see more people are getting it, but we are few. Your list is just the tip of the iceberg, literally every other day I will discover something new that's buggy and I'm not exactly looking for things to go full "Karen mode". I want this game to be at its best, and the direction just saddens me. 
---
For example, just some days ago I decided to try pet taming. God, I have an entire list of bugs related to it and how broken and unfinished it is as a feature. I want fixes and balance changes more than anything else. The need to finally sit down and polish this game.
---
So you want Less game and shop content...!? 
---
Apart from the Cultists I rarely see Mothman other than the Lighthouse event. Atom shop items don't bother me, I bought the backpack and left the rest.
---
Get wanted and chase by others, it fun.
---
Remove her
---
I don‚Äôt even know what the cool down is and after a day playing my inv is full of legendary and my stash is full also and I already maxed out my scrip
---
Yikes no man that's a lot of hours to play fo76 for us normal people that like to play multiple games.
---
remembers the gold .50 cal machine gun skin not working for the action hero survival reward for months
---
there is a workaround; put them in your vendor for 30k - no one will buy them and they won't get autoscrapped
---
I agree here. I like this game, but there's nothing worth spending extra money on it. It's a hard sell at it's purchase price purely because of how many things in this game that *dont even work.* Until they fix a ton of issues, there's no reason to buy atoms. I don't care if they cut back on the atoms earned, cause none of those items matter anyways.
---
It's on the same cycles of other machines and events which simplifies things greatly. A far better method would be a small increase in the amount you can scrap from 150&gt;200 so at least I wouldn't max out so often from a single successful SBQ and mob battle.
---
personally i wish they did more with the Mothman. like a boss level event. another nuke zone boss vs a Glowing Wise Mothman, you do not actually kill him though, instead beating him in a test of might gives you a super charged version of the Wise Mothman communion effect.
---
Thank youuu and I'm sure they're gooodüòÇ
---
#SHUN THE NONBELIEVER
---
True
---
Mothman will bathe in your blood, then have a nap.
---
Oh I'm not saying it's a good or bad change particularly. The usual kind of posts are appearing (saw a couple as I was scrolling through before this) saying how we've been 'deceived' and they've 'secretly nerfed' earning points... when they absolutely told us they were going to do this beforehand and explained how it would work. So I'm more calling out the BS of those people than defending the actual decision. Whether it's a good idea is a different convo.
---
I'm in the same position of not using photo frames or poses. I half more power armour skins than I know what to do with. And your comment has made me a lot less enthusiastic about the ammo convertor!
---
I'm hoping for some good weapon skins and camp objects.
---
Agreed, I'm about to take my first break from the game, 4200 hours in, but honestly I doubt I'll be back. I love the game, I've had a lot of fun. But I have principles of my own, and one of those is I do not like having things that I do not want to own , given to me without a choice. An option to opt out of seasonal rewards would keep me around for much longer. I've had first since they added it. I am not opposed to giving them money, I'm in favor of it. When they release fo1st rewards I don't want, I don't download them. That has been good with me. But with seasonal rewards. I'll have no choice but to have a bunch of shit I never wanted forced upon me. Monday will be my last day most likely.
---
Mothman 76 is greatest game ever. Atom shop needs more Mothman blease. Peoples at Bethesdmoth know what dere doings. Stop comblaning and join us. Mooooothman!
---
I added :)
---
What i've always found amusing is that the scrap/repair kits have always been mostly redundant noob traps since obtaining scrap is most of the game, White Knight mostly negates armor repair troubles, and gunsmith/makeshift warrior with Weapon Artisan mostly negates weapon repairing.
---
Ya, there's a lot of delusional people here that get up in arms about the microtransaction stuff.
---
The game is free to play.  They just released a massive DLC that added NPC's &amp; a new storyline, again for free.  They've roadmapped out these seasons of contents &amp; new stories &amp; such, again all FREE.
---
Hosting this game in the cloud costs Bethesda money.
---
Creating new content requires developers, artists, writers, and voice actors and - surprise - costs Bethesda money.
---
If you don't wanna buy atoms, then don't.  You can still play all the new content for free.
---
It is not that easy a question to answer. The rarest and most valuable don't always match. Ultracite shocks are extremely rare and valuable. Mire healing salve is rarer but completely useless. We do have a list of valuable plans. Feel free to DM me if you want to join the plan collector discord
---
&gt;d i have enough useless atoms saved up from the fallout first membership which i never have felt a need to spend them on all the useless stuff, but as far as i saw all of the rewards there are useless too 
---
I see alot of people complaining about nothing being worth it in the Atom shop. Im genuinely interested what you would want to be there. I see a lot of people complain but no one saying what they want there.
---
Just Radstag Desserts.
---
Hello. This is complimentary service where you can check what plans you are missing. I am not selling anything.
---
Mothman will see how many licks it takes to get to the center of your skull, non-believer.
---
Did they ever make champion points good again. I quit a few years ago, was champion level 850 . They gutted the system , I got tired of being jerked around.
---
Thank you for this. Half these comments try to put words in my mouth. This season shit sounds like more tedious garbage that just takes away our ability to choose what we actually want with the time we spent playing to get it.
---
At least I can choose what junk I want. At least until seasons comes out.
---
I don‚Äôt have a comparison point so I‚Äôm not sure how much better or worse it is. Max points is still 810, small percentage gains from putting a point in, several major passive abilities for putting 30,50,70,100 points into a single tree
---
Do you hear yourself?
---
And the hackers had it Day 1.
---
One time i found an ammo container and it had ammo in it!
---
Bethesda: "The Burrows will be a challenging dungeon for a lvl50+ team."
---
Translation: "The Assaultron boss is a challenging mob for anyone not using a build that deals thousands of damage per hit."
---
You can qear armor and get legendary perks, the armor just has to be broken.
---
I didn‚Äôt know the skull had pupils because of the eightballs. I took the picture of the skull on its top.
---
I managed to grind for more than 1000 Treasury Notes (and I‚Äôm spent at least that many on stuff)...I imagine doing boatloads of public events will shorten the time needed.
---
I‚Äôll do 6 - 12 Encryptids per day.
---
We all are Todd.
---
Im close to 100 and haven't seen her once, that sounds adorable.
---
Heres a comment about my build a made awhile back. Maybe itll help some people.
---
 I run a berserkers, its by far my favorite build. It adds a little danger back to the game. I run a stealth commando build. 
---
- I wear a full set of bolstering sentinel, wood armor ( ill explain why bolstering in a minute ). I break it all so i dont have any DR or ERr at full health. Wood armor is the best stealth armor in the game, besides the Thorn armor. When its shrouded, it literally weighs .45 pounds and gives you sneak bonuses. 
---
- On a side note, if you break all your armor, you cant take your armor off, otherwise youll have to rebreak it all. So you cant wear a radsuit to go into nuke zones. Wear power armor and keep an anti armor weapon around in your stash so you can stand a chance. Or you can get a lead lined backpack, radshield, and rad-x. 
---
- I also wear a Raider sheilded underlining. You can mitigate the DR/ER of it by getting addicted to med-x and wearing a high capacity backpack. This gives you a special boost without an armor increase.
---
- The reason i choose to run bolstering armor is because when you start taking damage, your literally 3 hits from death, depending on whats attacking you. This without your perk cards. Bolstering armor will help you tank damage, the lower your health goes, the tankier you get. It will allow you to take 3X-4X more hits before you die.
---
- While your taking damage, your Berserker's weapons will slowly become useless. So what do you do now? Switch to a vampires weapon, this will allow  to keep yourself alive longer as well as reduce the amount of stims you use. I keep 2 vampires weapons on me at all times. 1 is a laser rifle for ranged enemies, and a gatling plasma with a beamsplitter for those pesky melee attacks.
---
- As far as perk cards go, you basically want every card that can help you avoid damage. This is what my build looks like.
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c345fe&amp;d=a72ar2an2pp2la2l71lg2lt2a12ib4eh2l32c72ao0a81sg2pd2pk2pl2&amp;w=&amp;m=1469cf3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Berserker%20Rifleman
---
I run born Survivor to help tank damage as well, i keep a hefty number of Super Stims on me. These used together will keep you alive much longer.
---
- On a side not, my buddy runs a Berserker's as well. His is identical to mine except a few things. He uses bolstering cavalier armor, and also has moving target perk card equipped instead of born Survivor. When he starts taking damage, he runs out of sight to become hidden again. Once hidden, he uses stims to heal up.
---
- I also recommend keeping some phantom devices on you as well and hotkey them. Sometimes things get waaaay out of control and you need retreat. Phantom devices are awesome because they enrage the enemies around you, making them attack each other. This allows you to get away quickly and very efficiently.
---
I really hope this helps you out, id love to see some more Berserker's running around out there. Good luck!
---
We are getting berets....but gosh, we need an Enclave flag.
---
Todd is all.
---
And the gold bullion machine.
---
Todd says buy more atoms, subscribe to 1st, and buy skyrim on pc5, and buy the buster sword dlc.
---
What these two have said, by far the easiest. Or buy them from a player vendor if you seem them at a reasonable price. I pay 75-100c for mine If I'm feeling lazy and can't be bothered to farm them.
---
We do as Todd commands...
---
Nah man, its already 2 late. Theyll gradually add them. FYI, beth said in the beggining that you wouldnt pay for PERK card packs, but with seasons you CAN spend 150 atoms to buy multiples of them.
---
The way that poll is structured it seems to me that you‚Äôre deciding if you want to dupe yourself and just want the people‚Äôs opinion to make up your mind
---
I have come across him a few times on that stretch of savage divide east of top of the world. always freaks me out when i come across him at night.
---
It used to have options like crit chance, crit damage etc. then they killed that in exchange for really weak buffs. Stuck a big knife in all of my builds.
---
This is how a trap base finally got one over on me. They had them stacked on either side just inside the door towards their vendors and I thought it was a brown striped wallpaper I somehow missed in the Atom Shop, so I walked in, making a mental note to send them a message with compliments on the wallpaper. Started taking damage. Should have turned around then. Decided to be stubborn. Kept walking towards the vendor just a few feet away. Died. Couldn't even be mad.
---
Right? I‚Äôm at 155 and I just saw her today, but apparently she‚Äôs a common occurrence.
---
I think they might have changed it back then. There‚Äôs definitely crit chance, crit damage, and damage penetration options
---
&gt;Assuming that you sleep and work an exact 8 hours for both every single day during the 10 weeks, that equals 1,120 hours. Which leaves 340 hours outside of work, sleep, and fallout to eat, relax, piss, shit, shower, socialize, etc. If you can average about 3 hours per day, then you will manage to hit level 100 by seasons end. With Covid, most people now find themselves with more free time than ever. 200 hours in 10 weeks really isn't that bad. I'm married to a wife who dislikes video games
---
I always find argument with the "I have all these restrictions, but still i can do it, so if i can do it anyone can" They are not really thought through and a bit self centered. If your wife hates video games and you are spending 3 hours a day when you have a new born, i can see some unhappiness in the future, you heard it here first. But it¬¥s your life eyyyy. Now, this is not intended as a diss, if you feel like your life is in balance great, but that  argument you made is not a very good argument.  People have all different obligations and lifestyles and since you manage to fit it in everyone should be able to? thats ridiculous. Now that does not mean that i think that its too high. I like that this is a way for more dedicated players to get rewarded for the time. And then take the money of those who don¬¥t have the time to further develop the game. I think this game has been lacking in rewards that are hard to get.
---
Do you mean any UNY left leg piece or a decent one? Holy shit man that's a lot of left legs.
---
No one is making anyone do anything.  You can level up the battle pass through other means...
---
Not to mention that they'd also have to code it to only flag bags dropped on death or people would be intentionally dropping bags to initiate PVP and other people would have to stop dropping bags around Appalachia as presents for low levels.
---
How about just 'kindly add ceilings for our houses.' Don't have your default position be one of purchasing basic improvements. It only encourages them.
---
So no one told you about the Plan and Mod database google spreadsheet with trackable plan checklist? Search it on the subreddit.
---
Not exactly. I did different person schemes I have in mind and form their opinion regarding the way I imagined their behavior. Like a troll, a negative or a justicar person.
---
If you want my opionion dm me.
---
Think it's 20hrs after your last scrip.
---
we have been wanting this for a long time, but if you think about it, it will have a major negative impact on legendary economy and reason to log on/grind.
---
Really, glad I never deleted my characters, I'm thinking about getting it again now.
---
I honestly don't know which is worse: enduring through that afterthought of a mode or shelling out the cash just so you don't have to deal with it.
---
There is a whole entire set of NW specific dailies in addition to non- NW dailies and it will be a minimum 100 hour grind and maximum 200 to complete all daily missionsüëç
---
Well add me if you do and are on PC :) the new expansion is really fun! @sha
---
&gt; that does not mean that i think that its too high. I like that this is a way for more dedicated players to get rewar
---
Couldnt disagree more. What do you mean? People complain that Wastelanders was to short, then go ahead and say the grind is too long for gold bullion. I think this is a great way to reward people who dedicate the time, and then take money from the people who don¬¥t have the time to further develop the game and keep it running.
---
If they made the atoms cheaper then i would buy them but ¬£15 worth of atoms for 1 skin, no thanks
---
same here. never saw that bot.
---
Not OP but I'm of the same mind. I'm shit at pvp so i either get carried or die in the first 2 mins depending on the enemy spawns.
---
Cool, no problem man. I know you want your Charisma higher, so you could put those points there or split them between that and Strength, to max out Blocker like you were talking about earlier. I toyed with it, and found I like the higher Perception to help with V.A.T.S. accuracy. The rifle perks are there to take up the points, and help with long range engagements.
---
I rarely see any of this common stuff, I've only seen the insult bot twice in my time playing.
---
Yes this has happened to me like 3-4 times.  I have a second account mule so I join him to that server, close out my mains game, then rejoin my mule to get back on the server and then I‚Äôm able to loot the boss ( after I can find it ), usually someone will help me find it
---
Hopefully the future housing bundles are the same quality as this one!
---
Agree wholeheartedly!
---
Chill we get free dlc updates, they need money somehow. Allowing you to make atoms without the need of purchasing them is just bad business for the company.
---
We don't know any minimums and maximums.. Score is affected by public events and XP gains.  If you do many public events and grind hard on the XP it could be less than 100 hours.
---
Either way no one is forcing you to go into nuclear winter.  There are many other ways for you to earn score.  The people who like nuclear winter should be able to earn score by playing the way they want to play as well.
---
Who doesn't love some accurate wholesome content. üòÑ
---
Too bad it's kinda useless at the moment. It's about on par with T51b, and T51b is a world spawn while T65 takes a literal month of grinding every day to get. I've been running excavator for the carry bonus since forever.
---
The way that comment is structured it seems to me you‚Äôre a condescending person.
---
Just seems pointless.. what's the point in eating if you don't get hungry?
---
Ok you can do all of the PvE challenges and gain xp and do public events and level up your score.  The people who enjoy NW should have challenges to do as well not just PvE players.
---
That‚Äôs my impression as well, sounds like someone is trying to convince others and himself it‚Äôs ok to dupe.
---
Or you could just do all of the pve stuff to get score and not do any NW or pay cash.
---
Man, the free dlc up to this point has been pretty lack luster and the game still doesn‚Äôt work right in a lot of ways. Maybe if they fixed the game, they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the money. But they released a broken mess.
---
or has happened to me some times, said tent owner sees your encumbered ass coming from his vantage point above the tent, and just as you reach it he/she leaves/fast travels.
---
good times :)
---
Most of the new items come exclusive through atomic shop anyway, so you need this currency.
---
Public events reward very little S.C.O.R.E so the majority will he earned through challenges.
---
Normal XP dosent effect score reward- just challenge xp
---
Well 4 accounts is different than 4 characters on an account.  Obviously with 4 characters which I have all over 120, the highest being my main at 300, I am thinking it matters which one ‚Äúranks up‚Äù at certain times as I want to probably pick which one gets the bullion reward.  2 of my 4 haven‚Äôt done wastelanders and probably never will at this point given the time suck so I need to be careful with those or I am sure if I get a Score and it was bullion I get nothing.  Today I use them to do the alcohol dailies and stuff as they are both brewers.  But even if my main two I will have to think about it.
---
Back to your 4 accounts I am not sure how you play all 4 at once, maybe you are on PC, as on other MMOG‚Äôs I used to play a dual, have one tagged on follow and two keyboards side by side, and I know some daisy chained 4?  If you can do that, then cool and they would all level up together.
---
How i see it, its a feature, along with every other bug affecting PvP. None of the bugs to do with PvP will be fixed, theyre not even on Bethesda's known bugs list. And im not saying this to be a troll, i use to PvP regularly on 76 until a few weeks ago. Just cant muster up the strength to deal with it. Between being treated like scum by the community for wanting to take part in it and see it fixed, and Bethesda outright ignoring the community, its just not worth the headache. Its sad to say it, but the PvP in this game will never be fixed or balanced.
---
To fix game and release better stuff they need funding = they get funding by earning money = they cant earn money when the main currency can be earned without having to pay = they have to change how it works.
---
The perception for vats accuracy is a fair point, I'm a pretty bad shot so I use vats all the time. I'm kinda going on the assumption that being medium/close range I won't need as much perception for accuracy, plus if it doesn't, maybe it'll make me a better shot hahah either way it's a sacrifice but one I think could be fun
---
20hrs after first scrip after reset sounds more like it. I scripped one legendary and after 3 hours ish it reset (i scripped other thing before. I just had a few scrip left to gain)

From the Q  &amp; A section in that link:
---
### Q: ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?
---
**A**
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
i got downvoted for saying seasons are not fun after having played destiny 2 and rdr 2 lol
---
:) Lovely. Good job!
---
Use the mute button when in camp. I usually leave her about then after the daily back into storage.
---
They released a shot game that sold like shit. They literally got legally forced to refund people in Australia. Saying that they need more money to make it better is ludicrous. They need to make it better before they hold out their hands for more.
---
Yes, I‚Äôm correct. No need to send a paste quotes from a link üòÇüëç
---
Are the days to get max rep cumulative?
---
Since the punishment for duping has been wish washy. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs ok to dupe.
---
Yes I just explained this to you üòÇ
---
Well I'm sorry but that's not how business or the world works. It sucks but its sadly true.
---
Your camp needs to be placed high enough to climb, but low enough you can snake a foundation up from the bottom.
---
You end up with one staircase, basically ... then floors up from there.
---
have you thought about not bringing junk to SBQ
---
Yes, but look at all the cosmetics and shit you get as part of the season content.  Put an atom value on all of that and add it into your total.
---
No it's not. You too have to "work", those challenges won't complete themselves. It's a chore you're spending your time on to get stuff you need, comparison with a job is entirely fair.
---
For me it just means I play two characters and when one maxes out I switch over.  Only on a weekend do I max out both and after work on a weekday there isn‚Äôt enough hours so I chew through my excess during the week.  So by the end of the week I am back down, rinse and repeat.  The problem is if you get too much decent stuff and then hate to script it, but then I guess you dump to a mule.
---
Yea it‚Äôs kinda strange because those spawns are supposed to be ‚Äòmind controlled‚Äô by the SBQ, when she dies those beasts should be set free and peacefully walk around like garden of eden. But no they attack as if she‚Äôs still giving them commands. I die to that asshole mirelurk king so many times AFTER the queen is dead, which is why i like him because there‚Äôs not so many worthy enemies.
---
Tell that to CDPR. Not all developers are this snotty to their player base. This isn‚Äôt true.
---
I explained this to you in a comment two minutes prior to yours. Don‚Äôt act like an attention-seeking ü§°
---
I don‚Äôt want most of that stuff. That‚Äôs the whole point of the post.
---
Are you trolling?  You can earn score by gaining regular xp.  They literally mention it as something different than challenges.  I feel like I'm being baited lol
---
Or one of mine, which are all blackmail of men I have lured into my brothel
---
Thanks, but that doesn't seem to work for me.
---
Um, maybe put something in the store worth buying?  And stop cycling thing out of the store?
---
No u
---
I know right, if there‚Äôs not much punishment for stealing, everyone should go pick pockets.
---
Am I blind or are plasma cores not on there?
---
They are not getting rid of it. They are getting rid of the negative effects from not eating or drinking. You can still do it to heal and get the well fed/rested boosts
---
It'd be a cool gladiatorial pvp event, where you're given random weapons and armor to fight your opponent
---
Not OP either and I have tried it and games like there are not for me.
---
 I absolutely hate the fact that they hide adventure mode rewards in NW to try and force people who have no interest in it to play it.  I stomached it for 2 levels. I've even tried bushwhacking but it was so damn boring, such a waste of time.
---
 Looks to me like they're trying to incentivize people to play NW again by putting battle pass points as rewards.
---
Kind of a sucky thing to do.
---
You lost. Go away to your cave now, troll.  üëã

CDPR is a company that seemingly doesnt have higher ups solely interested on cash grabs and money. Beteshda does. CDPR is a smarter company that actually seems invested and passionate for their games, Betesdha is definitely seeing more pushes for earning money by their higher ups. Unless the top people are either removed or realise money isnt everything then Betesdha will keep going downhill.
---
Is duping as easy on the consoles, as I assume it is not?  I don‚Äôt really pay attention, nor sell and buy much at vendors, as I play mostly solo and over time I have got some good weapons/armor?
---
Pretty new to the game, how much is the costume there? And is there a level restriction?
---
I have lost so many caps from overselling. I try and hover my caps around 7K and I buy as many plans from WhiteSpring as I can to stay around that number, but I‚Äôm getting very close to having all of them, and been buying a ton of bobble heads and use theirs buffs constantly.
---
Also I spelled Bethesda wrong like 50 times sorry
---
Why is it sucky to give the people who play NW as their regular game-mode a chance to earn score along with all of the people who only play adventure?  You have your challenges and they have theirs and you can also earn score from public events and killing mobs in adventure.  No one is making anyone do anything.
---
You can simply bushwookie while doing other stuff. I usually see Netflix or read something, and managed to get all the new stuff. Yes, some pvps will get angry because you don't see their wonderfull habilities or cheats/glitches, but who cares. Pvp in this game is completely broken atm
---
That did cross my mind that this was a teaser to make you want to buy more from the Atom shop in the future.
---
 Thanks for confirming... but even so,  the negative effects make it more real.
---
They won't do it unless it is a bundle between 1200 and 1500 atoms.
---
It's a good feeling! What rolls did you manage to get? I'm having a lot of fun testing them out!
---
That says a lot more about you than it does about him
---
Also, nobody's duping junk
---
The keyword being "was". The game is now supported through fallout first memberships. And quite frankly the money they get from those subscriptions is most likely more than enough. Reducing the number of free atoms is just being more greedy, which probably was to be expected.
---
I did 2 of them and the one that I‚Äôm using is a 2 shot with 33 vats . It‚Äôs only a 2 star though
---
Any ONE of the effects can make it magical? Like a one star stalkers?
---
Not mothman but god damn power armor paints
---
Joining u now
---
They are just getting rid of downside of not eating and not drinking. You still can eat and drink. Dumb IMO but it is what it is.
---
&gt;Without 1st subs and atom purchases the game's as good as dead. It doesn't have the sales in terms of core game to sustain itself and expand, especially given the incessant shit dumping it receives on social media and in online reviews
---
Look, I'm sorry about all that but whose fault is this?  They released the WORST game at release.  
---
I have been a fallout fan since the original, but this one was garbage.  And we should all pay a monthly fee because they cant make it better?  Make it good enough for people to buy it?  -Wait!- they added something?   Fallout/Fortnite?  Who cares??  they need to add before they take away or they will only lose more customers and reputation.
---
I used to date a girl from Monroe!
---
Yep, try it out. Kill something outside vats, then use vats on the next one. Massive swing.
---
You can also equip a piece of armour with the "15% less damage blocking" effect and magic the shotgun vats too.
---
You don't even need a Bloodied build. I've got a J25 LMG and it could take her out in a minute, tops. The "magic weapons" are super broken.
---
Because they are 2 separate modes. One should have nothing to do with the other.  They should be absolutely separate from each other, no crossover anything. They have had adventure mode rewards as NW rewards since it started.  So the only way to get those adventure mode rewards is to stomach a game mode I hate which to me is very very sucky.
---
 I understand I can played adventure mode and level up my season pass up.  It just irritates me to no end that they try to force people that have no interest in that mode to play that mode.
---
I've got a feeling that vendors will no longer buy purified water now.  Maybe Bethesda were fed up of people making caps off of it to easily.
---
That 33 VATs is a **magic** effect (check Angry Turtle on YouTube). If you fire in VATs you'll get insane damage!
---
I saw your post on the discord channel after you lost your handmade. Sorry to hear you were scammed! Like you say, the trading system would be so simple to adjust and then we‚Äôd never have these issues again. I prefer doing weapon trades on reddit where I can go look through the other persons previous trade posts and karma etc (though there is always a risk no matter what) The Discord channel I mainly prefer to use for wtb/wts for caps.
---
Can people stop calling it a battle pass? 
---
And you don‚Äôt have to. Why do you think you have to? It‚Äôs just an option one one way to earn score. You can earn it in NW or doing public events in adventure. Makes sense to me.
---
Bethesda created a monster when they over priced literally everything in the shop.  
---
People are more likely to spend 5 to 10 bucks when they get their money's worth. But everything is frickin expensive which leads to another problem.  Players want to buy stuff they actually will use, not something that sits in the stash box.
---
Don't even get me started on the Camp budget. Lol
---
Thanks mate I didn‚Äôt realize one effect alone is sufficient. My fav roll so far is a Stalkers with LVC, but I didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs magic already lol, I‚Äôm still trying to roll something with two effects, i had thought it‚Äôs the combination that makes it work.
---
This is so wrong. They straight up said XP will give you s.c.o.r.e.
---
My second shotgun that I crafted also has 33 vats but it was a suppressors shotgun
---
Spongebob got a remaster?
---
Trade glitch
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. Fallout 76 has a lot of potential, but what we've seeing now is an economy lacking a trade window, an MMO lacking a reason to grind, a multiplayer game lacking chat features, an always online game lacking basic optimization, and ultimately, a Fallout game lacking it's charm.
---
That's not how online multiplayer RPGs work.  It's in their best interests to try to get everyone playing all the game modes.  I didn't think I would like NW at all either and I played it and liked it and ended up getting 100+ for all the rewards.  I have had friends who swore they would never play it and after trying it they play it much more than I do.  I only play now when there are the challenges for rewards for adventure as you said.  
---
These rewards are only cosmetic.  If someone doesn't want them they don't have to do them.  No one should expect to get every single cosmetic in an online multiplayer RPG unless you are playing all types of content.  
---
Other online multiplayer RPG games i have played in my life would gate BIS or near BIS gear for pvp behind pve and vice versa.  This is because they want everyone doing all of the content.  Be thankful it's only cosmetics.  
---
Personally, I for one enjoy getting out of my comfort zone and doing different things if it means i can earn some neat rewards.
---
One is a skin for armor and weapons and one is an outfit that can we worn over any armor. 
---
NW reward is better IMO
---
Such a good feeling to make him not only start paying you, but using one of the SPECIAL checks and charging him more. I still sell him Raider pics, but only to get more shit from him.
---
The one in NW is outfit. Season rewards are skins for the armor.
---
That'll still work! Try them out on Super Mutants! You might even one shot Scorchbeasts!
---
most mods for fallout 76 can only really be cosmetic or client side, currently we cannot install mods on private servers to have server sided mods
---
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
Im gonna clap his cheeks if i ever see him!  And Im gonna throw his eggs in a river!   And guess where my first nuke launch will go. Starts wirh a P.
---
1. I am STILL not talking about the subreddit, but rather how relevant he is as an INDIVIDUAL character.
---
2. Him being connected to 76 because of his robots is exactly why is not relevant as an individual character, because he's only relevant to the game because they exist. He adds nothing to the game as a character in any way.
---
Being relevant because you invented something in the franchise lore does not make you relevant as an individual character in every game. I mean, by your logic, mr house is an important INDIVIDUAL character in EVERY SINGLE FALLOUT GAME, even tho he's not even mentioned in all of them, simply because of the robots. That's flawed logic, because i'm talking about an INDIVIDUAL character, not what he has done in new Vegas, or what old lore tells us.
---
To be a relevant individual character, you have to add something to the game, and it does not need to be in physical form. Just something that affect the game in some way. As it stands, he's not more important in 76 than every unnamed npc you meet in the wild. You can't be a relevant and important individual character, if you can be removed without affecting the game.
---
Agreed.  Although really quickly because I'm curious why shouldn't it be called a battle pass.  battle pass season pass etc. all the same to me.  Is it because people don't like it being compared to fortnite?
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/ClassyManIAm
---
I think he is the one of the best
---
I am also a bit confused about this? Will the seasons affect anything else in the the game or do I only need to do the teir thing if I want those cosmetics? Can I still play the game like normal or is it totally changing the game? Thanks.
---
Right? I wouldn't even be surprised if we could buy perk packs once legendary perks are in. Y'know, just "speeding up the process" instead of making it good in the first place.
---
Haha. Yeah I'm not into skins at all. I play COD mobile and I still have the 1st skin they give you from when I first started last year. Maybe that's my problem. I look like a bot.
---
Personally, having rolled all the prefixes and tested, Quad is my favourite.
---
There's so little gain from damage prefixes it's not worth it. 
---
Then I found vats hit the best on star 2, all my 3 stars were lighter or 15% reload
---
I'm pretty sure, similar to a lot of gacha games, this kind of stuff survives on whales who spend a lot of money as opposed to many players spending small amounts.
---
A battle pass is something you buy into. Fortnite battle pass is $10 I think. If you actually bought all levels it would be $120. Nobody is expecting you to spend $120 to skip the season. Thats the difference. It isn‚Äôt even a ‚Äúpass‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a season.
---
Nooooooo that was my main source of income!!!! Nooooooo
---
ok, bye.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what a battle pass is? Completing challenges to level up and in earning exclusive rewards?
---
I have played MMO's and online multiplayer games since 2003 and never once was I forced to play a game mode I didn't like or want to play to get rewards for game mode I do play.  There have been games that have had PVP matches and such but I never had to leave the game mode to play them it was all included in the same mode.  I've never had to log out of a mode, join another mode and get rewards for the mode that I logged out of. It makes absolutely no sense to me and is a terrible way to do things.
---
As for getting out of my comfort zone, I have tried NW and it sucks.  I have played and tried many battle Royal games and they all have had the same effect on me, they suck.
---
Have you tried watching some livestreams on twitch?  There are a lot of great communities on there and I think there are many 76 streamers on twitch who are much more entertaining that many of the bigger youtubers.
---
I enjoy captainoob streams.
---
Mostly I watch twitch tbh.
---
You missed my point entirely. 
---
If I give you a dollar every day, then in a week you have $7. If somebody else shows up a week later, whom I also give a $1 every day to; then they will also have $7 after a week. However, you would have $14 by then, assuming you continue to show up for your dollar.
---
Now if I give you a dollar every day, but you can only make time to see me on the weekends; then at best you can only get like $2-3 per week. 
---
Furthermore, somebody could be logging serious playtime on the weekends compared to someone only logging in to do the challenges; but one is unilaterally rewarded. Personally, I always found some challenges to be way too chore-like to fool with. "Kill a megasloth in the Cranberry Bog?" **HARD PASS**
---
It was a grind just reading through this bullshit.
---
So what wouldnt be "goofy shit"? What *would* you spend money on? Bethesda cant offer it unless your willing to tell them what you want, since you dont like what they're offering.
---
And things that come with stats or progression attached are going to be an automatic no from the community, cosmetics only.
---
I guess no one agrees with me, 25 comments and not a single upvoteüòÇ
---
I like angry turtles stuff, usually interesting and informative. I don't really know of or follow anyone else.
---
So sad we don‚Äôt have ultra light for the SeSe limbs.
---
Maybe they should provide things that are worth spending atoms on, then? I'm not an mtxologist, but I feel like there needs to be some incentive to a) play the game and b) buy the shit they offer. So far, both of these vectors seem to point to a rather black hole somehow. 
---
I get the impression that Bethesda does know as much about a viable MMO ecosystem as they know about fixing bugs.
---
If yer on PC I can hook you up.
---
No, that was to get something other than a 1 star UNY.
---
I did the survey. Now I feel like a toddler.
---
Yeah but as I said, I am not looking for entertainment but info and guides in video form.
---
Don‚Äôt you need to buy a battle pass?
---
How do you have plenty of caps to spare but cant find material that is literally laying around?
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.  Battle Royale is the most hot and popular type of video game mode in the world right now.  You can't really blame them for pushing their own BR.
---
? Fallout has been memes since fallout 1. It's a satirical exaggeration of 60s atompunk popsci with a post-apocalyptic twist, it's always gonna be a little derpy, that's the genre.
---
Good, very good you made Todd proud...
---
Get any mods for it? I've got to get the arms and helm still, then moving on to the mods I want. Wish there was a easier way like being able to convert scrap gold to bullion.
---
I agree on this. The general mood of the atom shop is goofy and not very serious, which isn't fitting for a game THAT IS LITERALLY IN AN APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND. Most of the characters in the game are goofy as well, with their being few exceptions. Fallout made you feel like you had to fight to stay alive and carve your own path, now it just feels like the whole world forgot that they live in hell.
---
So much effort writing that for something you say you don‚Äôt like....
---
Have you watched angry turtle at all?  I dont watch much youtube but every one of his videos i've seen has been super informative
---
Wrong, yet again. Me saying it could have been phrased better does not deny my point, lol.
---
But by your logic, he's an important individual character in every single fallout game, even when he's not mentioned, and that's simply wrong. A character can't be important and relevant, if the character can be removed without affecting anything in the game, or if he's not even mentioned.
---
If this is true, why is UNY far harder to get than say troubleshooters or exterminators?  I roll those two probably 5x more than UNY.
---
Oxhorn makes fo76 content and lore, but not many streams.
---
Shotguns suck at range, I did roll Quad with FFR, Junkies with limb damage, etc, but I found out the stalkers will let me hit like a rifleman before the melee enemies get too close, especially the mirelurk kings. Stalkers let me finish them off before they rush me, but with other rolls I need to get closer to the targets. Quad is amazing too, works like a machine gun lol, still trying to roll a Q33 or Q limb damage.
---
Angry Turtle is the only 76 YouTuber that I watch.
---
I don't care if they have a Battle Royal. I hope it is successful so they can make more money to make more content and so  on.
---
Where my problem comes in is there are adventure mode rewards as rewards for playing a mode I despise. The two should not be connected in any way shape or form.
---
 If it was a successful mode and they had plenty of people playing it they shouldn't need to try to force adventure mode players to play it for rewards.
---
 But I digress, just my opinion I will leave it at that.
---
Angry Turtle is the man!! Very informative.
---
Going to check it out now, thanks!
---
I want a dragon head for the heavy flamer, and a .50 cal with bald eagle styled chassis over it.
---
That second one to go along with a *real* patriot PA skin with eagle wings holding the jetpack, and an eagle headed helmet, along with a buff to the Commie Whacker for the most american melee build
---
Ya, they definitely spread out the rewards by having all the different ghillie suits and the same power armor paint over and over. Lol
---
The game will not change in anyways.  The biggest change from it is you will no longer get atoms from daily or weekly challenges you will receive points toward the tiers.
---
Yeah i don't think we will agree but thanks for being civil.  Happy travels.
---
They‚Äôre changing the challenges to be less specific w it the new update
---
Wish I'd thought of this :)
---
Holy Scorchbeast!!  I admire your discipline in not spending those atoms.
---
I managed 1500 once......then caved and bought stuffs
---
Yup! It‚Äôs a whopping 7% damage reduction per armor piece (helmet + left leg + left arm + right arm + right leg + torso) for a total of 42% damage reduction. Top that with nerd rage and mutations and you are an almost unstoppable tank.
---
But only really nice if you use these items. If you like any of the PA skins great you just saved 1500-1800 atoms, have a weapon that can use one of the weapon skins? Sweet saved another 500-700. 
---
I don‚Äôt use PA and there aren‚Äôt any pistol/revolver skins in the seasonal rewards.
---
Ok thank you!! I was super worried the whole game was gonna be like fortnite or something üòÇ
---
A nuka trip is the only reason I drink from them.
---
It really is hard not to see this as a blunt force trauma way of "forcing" people into buying atoms.
---
The cynic in me is expecting to see the amount of time that bundles and "LIMITED TIME ONLY!" items are around for will mysteriously decrease to coincide with the fewer amount of atoms you can passively earn.
---
You want people to actually buy stuff from the ATX Bethesda?
---
1) Cut the prices by 1/3 or 1/2. Why would anyone spend \~$16 on a skin or a bundle when you can get a game that's on sale on Steam? So many *cosmetic items* are being sold at prices that equate to DLC prices for other games.
---
2) For the love of atom ***stop with the insane amount of "GET IT BEFORE IT'S GONE!" artificial scarcity already.*** Just leave things in the shop, and only do the "limited availability" during holidays/events.
---
3) Stop focusing on so many big ticket items. When was the last time a new hairstyle was introduced? A new tattoo? Face paint?
---
No start up and play the game as normal.  Eventually people will have guides on the best way to grind.  Have a good day!
---
If I did Reddit awards I'd be totally hooking you up!  This is so awesome!  At level 389, one of the things I find fun is to learn and uncover plans I do not know.  It is pretty damn rare anymore.
---
It turns out I do not know 50 plans on the list.  It's great to know exactly what I am missing.  I noticed a number of the PA mods, which I am currently working as a great cap sink.  I saw some of the elusive BOS paints, the one pioneer scout plan i'm still working on badges to acquire, etc.  There were some in there I was like, "oh, didn't know about that one."
---
Again, THANK YOU!
---
Personally when I look at the season I think I am getting more useful things than I would get without it (ammo converter, bow skin, etc)
---
Will you be starting a PS one soon, I could donate a few plans
---
Oh so I only need to get involved with the season pass if I want those cosmetics?
---
No level restrictions, but the head is 300 tokens and the costume is 150. It is a serious grind seeing as the maximum you can get every day is 9 üôÉ. The costume is great though!
---
See the problem with this is that alot of people work longer than 8 hours a day, and some days playing for even an hour would be impossible. Im in the same boat as you (2mo old, wife doesn‚Äôt mind games) but I still rarely have time to play on a weekday, let alone on my one day off when I can actually do stuff around the house. Totally understand why you think that, but those numbers dont work for 90% of casual gamers.
---
Preach üôå
---
KEEP EM COMIN WITH THE DOWNVOTES!
---
Top ten photos taken seconds before disaster
---
And because I can see the potential -- I am sticking around and truly want to support the game and its development, but it is becoming hard for me to do so.
---
I got about 50 HRF from nuking whitesprings on a private server. Once all enemies are killed, log out and log back in immediately to respawn the mobs.
---
Robco being founded by him in the lore does not make him an INDIVIDUAL important character, because then he's an important relevant character in every single fallout game, tho he's not even mentioned in all of them, and that's wrong.
---
To say that what he has done is relevant is true, but he's still not important or relevant as an individual character in every single game. He can't be, if he's not mentioned OR if he can be removed without affecting anything at all.
---
I think pvp in a game like this would never work, it's the same as it was in Borderlands. People will walk around with 1 hit kill nukes and there's no room for skilled gameplay like that. Coop is really nice though  
---
Mayhaps coop with strangers surviving hordes of enemies akin to the popular "survival" gamemodes of other titles would be cool
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
By NPC do you mean Non-player character?
---
it just works
---
How do you actually meet the mothman? I have done the path to englinment event but that only spawns a "wise mothman"
---
I started a new top level comment.  You guys are awesome.  Didn't know 50 plans.
---
Excellent. Glad it helped :)
---
I want the cymbal monkey trap
---
I think we made it work :)
---
Troll says what....?
---
My mom made me do that whenever I broke wind in the house.
---
‚ÄúCivil‚Äù and ‚Äúhappy travels‚ÄùüòÇ Just leave you hypocritical-troll
---
Yeah agreed, we will have to see if they new rewards are worth it, but yeah I jumped on just for challenges ..  also we can expect them to make changes by season 2 if it becomes a slog else they going to lose people. It might be ok, we will see.
---
Let us not overlook the fact that sales of this game were likely extremely poor compared to projections.  BGS has to make back the money invested in the game somehow
---
Yeah, I've spent hours upon hours on my base, mostly because of finicking around with the build system trying to streamline and polish things, cause I'm never quite satisfied if things don't sit well.
---
And I've grown to hate the stairs in this game. The one without a platform looks so bare and the one with a platform is a bitch to work with, as you seemingly can't place walls facing outwards on it.
---
But I am considering making new characters just to be able to create more bases, cause I've put too much time and effort into this one to just take it all down.
---
Every single game has Robco robots in it, connecting them to the lore, which if anyone looks into it, will connect them to House.
---
He is kind of relevant in every single game, just as the lore of something like the 2077 war would be even if there is no lore alluding to it.
---
You're so desperate to be right, but your argument holds so little weight. You're arguing semantics, if anything.
---
###mothman is life

##MOTHMAN IS LIFE
---
I have 11k, only ever had 1 month of fallout 1st and I own almost everything that atom shop has - I've mostly only ever bought what was on sale or discounted.
---
neat
---
Lol i proved you wrong with an official website link and you are soooo mad xD
---
Just because the idea is to buy things from the shop doesn‚Äôt mean the things there are WORTH real money. 
---
They aren‚Äôt. Some people may think they are, but as you said the vast majority don‚Äôt. I have never bought any, nor will I ever.
---
Sorry, my bad. Must have misremembered something else being 3 weeks. It was actually 6 days From May 14 (announcement) to May 20 (clarification).
---
I'll correct my original comment but it still holds, 6 days for a response that could have taken 1 minute to clarify still doesn't look good.
---
I like the Glow in the Dark stars wallpaper because I had something similar growing up in my childhood room but I'm not sure that it is worth the grind to rank 20.
---
MOTHMAN IS WHACK
---
Realistically, though, how many people actually did all the daily/weekly challenges for atoms?  Sure, many people did some, but mostly because of the fact it aligned with what you were already doing (aka, kill an encryptid monster, kill ghouls, etc).  But honestly who was doing stuff like "kill a tick while wearing a maid outfit while the sun is setting" for 10 atoms?
---
Ahh okay I can see why since it's free that calling it a pass seems a bit odd.  I guess i just call it the battle pass out of habit.
---
I‚Äôm aware of the ‚Äúofficial website link‚Äù before I posted this suggestion üëç look at my past post
---
Who‚Äôs the mad one now?
---
Thank you for those kind words ‚ù§Ô∏è yes, some plans are rather pesky. Good luck with getting everything
---
I kinda miss the days when the Queen fight lasted a while.  If the mobs were regular and feeling generous I would come away with 5 or 6 legendaries.
---
I have the feeling you‚Äôre going to get a high number of people who flat out don‚Äôt care if people dupe or not.
---
As mentioned, AngryTurtle and CaptainNoob.
---
If you want to make Gatling Plasma guns I'd say yeah.
---
I always buy mine on Sunday afternoon. Not had an issue yet. (Knocking frantically on wood)
---
I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äòimportant in every game‚Äô. I said ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô. 
---
Read what the rule says. 
---
If the character was removed, then everything he did is also removed. That‚Äôs simple cause and effect. 
---
The Original Responders aren‚Äôt in the game. But they are relevant.
---
They are there to guard the one star lead pipe the queen dropped and make you work for it if you actually want it.
---
As someone else said the second she dies I'm running off to the nearest tent (always at least one there somewhere) and whatever crap the queen dropped can wait.  The flux is the only reward I actually want anyways.  I've only ever gotten killed and lost my flux maybe 5 times out of hundreds of fights but it pissed me off enough that I make a mental note of the nearest tent as soon as her health gets low now.
---
Umm... that's not my comment you're quoting.
---
mountain mama.
---
No probs. And indeed - that database spreadsheet was our first project.
---
That's how I found out, one time I missed it and tried Monday...no go. Try it...I dare you :-)
---
I feel the exact same, I too have played all games since fallout 3 and the companions were one of my favourite aspects of the games, especially in fallout 4. I think Bethesda may be avoiding traveling companions due to the pvp elements of the game (even if they are lacking), I mean if a level 20 walking around with a dog got in a fight with a level 100 waking around with a sentry bot the fight would be even more unfair
---
Awesome. Yes, we are just starting a PS4 one. If you would like to join the efforts you can DM me
---
&gt; 2. he's only relevant to the game because they [the robots] exist.
---
Bingo. He is relevant. **WHY** he is relevant is **IRRELEVANT**.
---
Nice and thanks for the information. I'm between this type of build and vampire. But as you have pointed out it seems this would be a viable build and just keep a vampire weapon as regen. I'm not deleting this post as there's plenty of useful information you provided. Thanks for taking the time to reply in detail. Looks like I'll be keeping any decent berserker weapons I find with my main account. Thanks.
---
if you want to learn all the Gatling plasma mod plans, except for prime. yes, craft and scrap until you learn em all
---
They weren‚Äôt that hard for the last 6 months or so. Even I didn‚Äôt do them back when they were that difficult but I get all my dailies in about 5 minuets now. 15 min max and the weekly only takes me an hour or so except for a choice few challenges like the brewing one. People argue that the challenges are hindering Bethesda‚Äôs income and others say no one really even touches the atoms. Either way, I‚Äôd much rather have the freedom to pick and choose my rewards without having to spend actual cash on it. Why would I want to give a company money that released a mess of a game and continues to hold their hand out a year and a half later with a game that‚Äôs still a mess and has hardly followed through with their promises. At this point, I wish fallout wasn‚Äôt my first RPG because I really want to stop supporting this game. I just love the franchise too much. Which makes it even worse to see it crumble like this.
---
No, the problem is companies putting a carrot over your stick and keeping in-game clothing hostage by saying "uh-uh! Your community didn't fill up the required quota of atom sales, no more DLC for you!" 
---
Nope, sorry but if we ever stop seeing support for FO76, it definitely won't be because we didn't pay them enough money for cosmetics...
---
Thinking that the only way you can please your overlords is by shoving more money their way is ludicrous, and going to reddit to essentially shame people into buying microtransactions is pretty disgusting.

You do not meet the mothman,  the mothman meets you.

##OK

Are thay like the guns form wastelands
---
It will happen automatically nothing to buy or sign up for.
---
Instigating would be best. You get double damage on explosion as well.
---
Isn't that the job of board members of a company? Increasing revenue.
---
Yeah I did exactly the same :(
---
Try vats at multiple ranges, you'll see the distance is a lot better and you can start to judge it yourself.
---
No. You will just be crafting standered non legendary versions of them
---
Yea I‚Äôve been using vats with shotguns, it‚Äôs like the only way to make this type of weapons viable lol
---
I hope writing that was worth it for you because I didn't read most of it.
---
All the best.
---
I wish they would expand the radio every so often. I'd pay a few more bucks for monthly radio content.
---
Oh shit man. I have a horrible habit of not giving credit where credit is due. I‚Äôve been linking and telling people in game about your project since it came out. Huge huge fan. I usually look at content more than the author in cases where it‚Äôs not academic research ie video game spreadsheets. Continue doing the amazing work you guys do. 
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about doing something similar on the PS4 if anyone else would want to try to start this endeavor there with me.
---
It's a fast firing end game heavy gun mate, if you run a heavy character they are good weapons. 
---
The wastelanders one is a guass minigun, also a heavy weapon but uses different ammo. 
---
Not my forte to be honest with you, I usually run a rifle build. They do make a nice mess of whatever you point them at though.
---
legends say she's still playing that fucking tune on her guitar
---
I swim underwater using aquaboy perk. I don't die as often.
---
Glad you enjoyed it. Lol. Ive been preaching this for almost over a year now. Everyone thinks Berserker's is a trash build, but in my opinion its one of the top META's. If your on xbox, i have a vast collection of god rolled Berserker's weapons you can sift through. I pick them up whenever i see them, if they ever buff the effect, im sitting a small fortune. Lmao
---
Exactly. There is no pass.
---
Shhhh.... they'll bring back Preston!
---
No, i am not, because i know i'm right. I'm still talking about him being relevant as an INDIVIDUAL character, Aka, a character that adds something to the game on their own, and not by only being in the franchise lore. You can't say a character is important to a game, if he's not in the game, mentioned or anything else, because then he's not a character in the game at all.
---
The same goes for a character that's only mentioned shortly, without affecting the game, story or anything else, because then he's not important or relevant. What he has invented IS relevant, and mentioning him on a post about robco makes him relevant on that topic, but not relevant as an individual character in 76, or games where he's not even mentioned.
---
imo, for future seasons, they should let you opt for atoms for any cosmetic items you unlock, and allow you to buy that item later in exchange for the same number of atoms - zero sum if you ever choose to unlock it. 
---
Depending on the item, between 50-150 atoms for each of the 40 cosmetic's season 1 has could provide the same quantities of atoms that are currently available.
---
Would be abused. I‚Äôve got a mule and he‚Äôs got loads of atoms from doing starter stuff. If those atoms could be sent to my main it would be a major exploit. $5 bum account/unlimited free weekend accounts for loads of atoms
---
Implementation matters. They'll definitely have NW-specific challenges but if you can complete the season without doing any of them, it's not that big of a deal.
---
If it's impossible to do without doing the NW challenges, THAT I have a problem with and am with you 100%.
---
I'm.... apprehensive on this.  All I remember is companions running off to engage enemies I didn't see or stepping on traps I avoided in f04 lol.  Most of the time I had to heavily mod them to make them live.  And, I assume, companions that only get downed and don't die would be abused.  I'm guessing the house guests is the best we might get.  I do miss ED-E though.  Going to Freddy's, I felt a spike of nostalgia.
---
I felt the same way early on, and now even nearing level 60 with over a hundred hours in, there's still areas on the map I don't venture to without my Chinese Stealth Suit
---
I‚Äôd be okay with that
---
I get my atoms purchased through fallout 1st. Which I‚Äôve invested my money in 4 month so far.
---
 I think it‚Äôs good that they offer the fallout 1st option for more ease and luxury in the game, but I‚Äôve been playing this game from the start and I have to say there are times I‚Äôve pulled my membership waiting for them to improve the game before I fund them again.
---
Go Harrass other players, either with gifts of plans or artillery fire on their camp.
---
Challenge new players to do the obsticle course for fully upgraded legendaries (of their level)
---
I made a unmarked locations map a long while ago that im sort of trying to finish, so thats fun.
---
One of the best things of fallout are radios, i wish they would add NV and 4 songs, even if they should pay for those again.
---
&gt;It sounds like they are taking away my choice of what reward I will receive for my grinding
---
That's exactly the problem. With the current system, every daily or weekly challenge gives me a handful of Atoms that I can save up to work towards getting *something* I **want**, but with SCORE, I won't get to choose - I can either keep grinding, getting "rewards" I have no interest in and will never get any use out of, or I can just... stop playing.
---
After 1000+ hours and talking about this game with so many different people I think i've come to this conclusion:  
---
Either you like it, or you don't.  Some people can't stand grind and repetition.  Me on the other hand, if you give me a good IP and a cool world I'll grind forever.  It is what it is.
---
Eh. It depends. 
---
If the only way to get to Rank 100 is to do NW or even a bunch of team challenges and it's impossible say to do it solo, you don't have much of a choice really.
---
I've modded the hell out of my game and I've been fine for over a month now. 
---
There was an unofficial CBBE for awhile but it got taken down. It's still possible to port your own version but it's technical.
---
There's an Enhanced Vanilla Bodies mod that works though.
---
Angry Turtle is the only one I know that I also enjoy
---
Thanks for the kind words :)
---
We are just starting a PS4 plan mule project give all the comments. If you want to be involved I need to link you up with the PS4 folks. Best bet is to DM for details
---
We just work.
---
The minimum isn't 100 hours. 1 hour is what bethesda expect to complete the low level ranks and 2 for the higher ones so you're probably closer to 150 hours on average. Certainly closer to 150 hours than 100 hours.
---
You can do it solo.  You can literally grind xp by yourself or do public events. 
---
It‚Äôs a must-have if you like camp building
---
Someone will find a glitch and complete it in 30 hours.
---
I lay with the missus, and we just explore.
---
Pick a road on the map and follow it end to end.
---
Follow a railroad.
---
Hell, we even walked around the very edge of the map, with an almost constant "You cannot go this way" message in the corner because our elbows were out of bounds.
---
Think we've found every single map marker there is, and we've had fun doing it.
---
I can't imagine this game is any fun solo, but with friends it's great fun.
---
"I know I am right"
---
Can't argue with that unwavering ego. /smh
---
Just did.
---
I guess if you can sign in with all 4 accounts at once just bounce each accounts charscter to events and slowly level up i guess. Or just do easy daily and weekly challenges on them and keep the harder challenges to your main account.
---
My question is why do you even have 4 accounts?
---
You should get the dirt tiles if you don't have them as well.
---
&gt;The game is free to play.
---
...no, it's not. "Free to play" means you are not required to spend money on it *ever*; here, you still need to make the initial purchase of the game.
---
toodle ooh!
---
I think they do not do this to keep people who would not otherwise use them from giving them to people who Bethesda would prefer to purchase more.
---
Atoms are a literal fictional currency, they can afford to give it out for free as much as they want. 
---
It's not the consumers fault if a product doesn't work. Blaming the consumer for the problems of the company only perpetuates the idea that the company can do no wrong.
---
Yes, we all work with fallout 1st...
---
That is beyond obvious.
---
This is awesome!

fast travel to cultist camps and you might find him there gracing his loyal followers with his presence

Nobody forced you to do that

Borderlands 1 has the best atmosphere and we don't talk about the pre sequel

Fair comment
---
Wow I never thought to take pictures without me in it. What does that say about me.
---
Bought mine for about 1200 caps from the vendor bot in Camden park.
---
Any??
---
you can buy the rifle plan from the BoS vendor in watoga. If it's not there try hopping. Aso the BoS vendor inside whitesprings. 
---
You can apparently get it as a random drop as well from robots.
---
&gt;acter's camp at that might be something you could use. A bit southeast from foundation, there's a spot with an arch-like rock formation. The terrain isn't very level, but could work for a vault style build. If your on ps4, I could show you what I did with it.ReplyGive AwardshareReportSave  
---
&gt;level 2lumberjackalopes Lone Wanderer2 points ¬∑ 20 hours agoIs there a lead deposit and a hidden acid deposit in a cave below?If so friend, we camp at the same spot.
---
But yes there is, if you walk alongside the west side of the arch you will find a lead deposit right beofre the cliffs edge. Then att the bottom of the cliff there is a cave with an acid deposit in it (:
---
The ncr hasnt been formed yet, let alone have retirees
---
...oh no.....
---
I think I'm going to definitely go with this build. Sadly I'm on PS4. But once I get to level 65 I look forward to grinding for weapons. I hope they buff other builds as it's very unbalanced.
---
I like the look of the new Ghillie Armor paints better than the suit/outfit but even still I'm glad I got it. It has a bit of prestige to it and that'll increase as time goes on I think. It'll become more of a rare item while the new armor paints will likely be super common after a while.
---
I think I remember seen a CBBE beta that was kicked off. I think it's still a work in progress mod though.
---
Also, only you'll ever see it so don't be expecting to rock a particular look with other people. You'll look the same as your pre-mod self to everyone else.
---
Try vendor bot phoenix in watoga, the plan should be available from him. Buy the plan make them and scrap them for the mods.
---
Im just shy of 100 and I've seen 2 apart from the wise one. It's just luck mostly.
---
When a single skin costs the equivalence of $15, a single door costs $5... yeah, totally not going to support that. I would rather pay for story expansions than support that level of ridiculousness. 
---
I think I‚Äôve spent 5 bucks since launch on  atoms and that was because my wife absolutely freaked out when she saw the game had a succulent set. She didn‚Äôt have enough atoms, so I bought them for her. Haven‚Äôt seen anything else either of us absolutely wanted, that we couldn‚Äôt get with saved up atoms earned in game.
---
I like the idea in spirit but there aren't very good tools in the game to support it in my opinion. I realize part of the idea is "creating" your own fun, however we need some basic stuff and infrastructure to make it work.
---
I have played as a Responder character since early on in the game.  Sure I had many outfits but they didn't release any camp objects for about 14 months after release.  Tough to make my camp look like it fits the bill. Finally have my camp up to snuff, but I shouldn't have had to buy every last thing to make it look the way it does.
---
Another issue is server size.  There just aren't enough people to really create anything, not to mention the world resets on every server.  A 
---
**Here are a few solutions:** 
---
1. During the story line the game needs to award faction camp and cosmetic outfits. These could be just regular run of the mill items with the premium stuff being for sale. We shouldn't have to buy everything from the atom shop.
---
2.  Add faction hubs in the game.  There are tons of places they could add NPC's and make it the "base" for each one.  This would make finding your group a million times easier.  We have Crater, Flatwoods, Foundation, Harpers Ferry, etc that could be populated with npc's and players.  Each faction would work in a such a way that they are enemies with certain groups and allies with others creating a system of check and balances.  
---
3. Each faction has a reputation system that you gain favor with by doing quests and objectives. Gaining reputation with the Responders makes you lose reputation with the Raiders.  Have a negative rep with the Raiders??? Well, they attack on sight. Each faction would work in a such a way that they are enemies with certain groups and allies with others creating a system of check and balances.  BOS hates Enclave, Raiders hate Responders, Responder are friendly with BOS, Enclave is Friendly with Raiders, etc, etc.
---
4. Each faction has a vending machine similar to the Pioneer Scouts that allow you to select your rewards depending on how many Commendations you have.  This would be a nice way to show off rank and prestige in your group. I loved the idea of grinding and choosing the exact reward I want.
---
5. Have faction related community events similar to the Clean up Appalachia event we had last fall.  Make a workshop permanently become owned by factions. Maybe determined by total amount of time a respective faction has controlled it over the course of a month.  Give the Responder faction a cosmetic supply wagon if all the Responder faction players deliver enough supplies to Flatwoods tavern. Earn cool rewards for Crater by robbing/killing settler and Blue Ridge Caravan groups.  Idk..... just spit balling but this would be great.
---
6. There have been amazing posts created around T.O.W.N.S (similar to camps) that would allow factions and teams to build together in a larger area.  I love this idea and would love to see it come to fruition.
---
7. As far as text chat goes I don't have an opinion.  I play on xbox and use a mic.  I hate trying to type crap on the xbox controller but I can see how it could be handy for PC people.
---
Anyhow that's my 2 caps.  
---
TLDR: Role play could be a lot of fun with some simple tools and infrastructure.
---
If solo, you can have the caravan wait at the gate (where you kill the Captain), and use the time to find all four crates, then go back and restart the event by pushing the button.
---
It adds a few extra minutes, but totally worth it.
---
Lol someone of them really are. As soon as I can hear the ignorance or as soon as they start interpreting things in whatever way is most convenient for them, I start dumbing down my answers so they can‚Äôt manipulate what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs a lost cause though, you right.
---
I'm writing a Fallout 76 novel &amp; using my game-time to further develop the story.
---
I feel your pain. In the past two weeks, I've been griefed by trap camps twice. Once was a hidden stacked punji board trap in front of a vendor, he also teabagged me, tried to steal my loot. Luckily my husband u/thegentlemanblacksmith grabbed my whole bag, and everything out of his free vendor, while he was busy.  His username was along the lines of 666samhain666 (XB1).
---
Second time was a camp where I was looking for the vendor, so when I first arrived I rounded a corner into a door. As soon as I do, the door locks behind me, I can't unlock it, and I start getting blasted by flamethrowers. No choice but to stand there and roast to death. And no option to retrieve my loot because the door was still locked. Which sucks, I had cryptid parts on me.
---
It's not the same thing at all though, your comparing stuff with real world, legal ramifications to fallout. Fo76 isn't a real world economy or job. 
---
It's an mmo, which by design reward die hard players. You are choosing not to play, just as you would be choosing to accept your weird dollar/time comparssion. That kind of thing happens in real life all the time.
---
By absolutely no means should a person who plays less than another person have the all of the same stuff. This kind of thing also happens all the time in video games.
---
If I missed your point, its because it was barely a point to begin with. Not trying to be rude here with anything but complaing that you want stuff without playing for it, is just ridiculous
---
If you're stealth, 100% unyielding. If you're not stealth, still 100% unyielding but you could hedge your bets with bolstering.
---
However with SS, you're already noticeably more tanky than regular armour anyhow, so may not be necessary.
---
DR has diminishing returns past a certain threshold. what exactly that threshold is up for debate, but a set of SS armor has more than enough DR as it is.
---
more importantly, as a bloodied build, a full bolstering set wouldn't make you noticeably tankier. it's a pretty niche effect really.
---
Thanks !
---
Do you know everything? I assume you don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs just pedantic. 
---
[Gilbert Hobson the NPC](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gilbert_Hopson)
---
Agree with this. I actually kinda like the slow pace of working on my camp, setting up my shop and exploring. As a world you can live in, I find it pretty fun in itself, but can see why people wouldn't like that. Definitely either like it or you don't.
---
After playing a certain number of hours the only left to do is get every plan in the game.  Collect them all.
---
I agree, I understand why Beth wants to do it. But it‚Äôs wrong. 
---
This whole thing could‚Äôve been sorted if they released content for sale, similar to how Elder Scrolls Online did. But because they ‚Äúpromised‚Äù for not selling DLC, corporate monetizes it as much as possible. 
---
Another thing was the rumor of making the seasons, besides summer, would require payments. I wholeheartedly agree that was the original intent, however, backlash turned it around for the moment. 
---
I love 76, but man is it really unfun to play if you don‚Äôt have Fallout 1st as the junk limits hurt what small storage you get.
---
I‚Äôll let you know, but thanks for the offer! Keep in touch
---
I cannot speak for the OP but I myself have 3 accounts on 2 different PS4s.  I only had to pay for one of them and I can have many many more if I wanted for free.
---
I mainly use them for storage or trading between my characters.  I have 8 or 9 characters with max caps and full of legendary gear that I have acquired in my 400 levels of playing on my main.  I have 4 characters over level 50 that can scrip gear because of that silly 150 scrip A-day limit.
---
There‚Äôs 1 crate and the first ‚Äúrest stop‚Äù, 1 at the middle boss, &amp; 2 after the middle room(boss room/gate)

Army of Sheepsquatch Impostors, I need a thrill.
---
All that tells you is that you can gain score that way. It doesn't tell you if you can gain enough through these alternate methods to get to Rank 100.
---
Hey, thanks! I‚Äôll keep you updated!
---
Please have every upvote
---
The consumers are also the ones bitching about everything and leaving shitty reviews about a game they probably have 0 hours in 
---
If the product doesn't work expect acting like a spoiled brat tell them the issue, I fail to see how this is difficult..
---
Yikes!
---
Whenever I see posts like this I always get mega jealous! Me and the missus have a ps4 and Xbox. I play on PS4 but can't convince her to play as she won't play unless we're together (she uses the Xbox). Would absolutely love cross play on this game so we could play together!
---
There are still normal challenges you can complete that give you only atoms and aren‚Äôt part of the season
---
The actual locations are random - sometimes you get lucky &amp; they are in plain site, but other times you do have to hunt them a bit.
---
I can guarantee you that you can get to rank 100 quite easily without ever even touching a NW lobby.
---
I got him to admit elsewhere that House **is** relevant to FO76, but only because of the robots. 
---
And that was the point all along. Is he relevant or not. And he admitted he was. 
---
**Why** House is relevant or the degree to which he is relevant was never the point. 
---
He‚Äôs done. Now he‚Äôs just moving goalposts to have a discussion he wants to have instead of sticking to what he originally claimed. 
---
It‚Äôs quite satisfying to see him have to backpedal and try a different approach.
---
The treasure hunter hat and insurgent hat still remove hair and facial hair üò≠
---
Actualy im not complaining at all, i just dont care much about cosmetics. The only things i bought from the atom shop where black paints for weapons and armor as i wear mostly black or dark clothing in real life. All the other fancy stuff is not for me as i dont even build a camp for myself (im a day one beta player and with all the bugs in the beginning i lost interest in building and never started again even if i know it got better regarding camp building bugs).
---
I mostly would like to get some more spec ops themed matt black paints for other weapons and normal armor but i dont care much if it will never be in the shop üòú
---
If they are just mules do you really need all the rewards? I see the ammo machine being useful but that's about it.
---
No, you're simply not reading anything i write, because you're in the regular "fallout fanboi" mode, that pops up when people don't agree with you.
---
I have literally stated that: 
---
1. his company is relevant in every game. 
---
2. He's relevant for the franchise, super important.
---
3. Talking about robco on 76 subreddit is relevant, and mentioning him on that topic is relevant as well.
---
You just ignore that, because you're so set on being right. He is NOT an important OR relevant character in 76. He literally adds nothing to the game, other than being an easter egg for those who have played new Vegas. He is simply a random dude to every other new player.
---
One time only. Most of which I‚Äôve already done. Maybe if they added a fair amount of challenges periodically but they don‚Äôt.
---
Given how most players would probably use their companion, I think Bethesda should add a literal pack mule as one of the companion options.
---
Yes but once you know where to check it‚Äôs like riding a bike it‚Äôs a habit. And having random ppl join and camp by the boss is obnoxious to say the least
---
They're random. I've gotten 2 very early on.
---
It's not a horrible thing to be sure.
---
The problem is we are stuck doing the same stuff, over and over and over.  Just like post Wastelanders.
---
No I will only use the rewards on my main I was just giving an example of why somebody would have 4 accounts
---
Thanks!  I do run 1 piece of chameleon gear right now.  It remains to be seen how beneficial is it to me but I do play pretty much exclusively solo.
---
This is what I always do. Don't open the gate, systematically sweep the tunnel. Continue on.
---
Yeah it's about the grind and making your own fun.  I like to set goals for myself like ok today I want to get 40 treasury notes or I want to gain this many levels or even long term ones like my goal right now of getting every single gold bullion plan in the game.
---
Stuff like that keeps me going.
---
You know there are npcs right?
---
Oh yeah, I've had people be able to find all the crates between the first set of Blood Eagles could be killed.
---
No they‚Äôre not what is said is a fact there‚Äôs 1 in the beginning 1 by the boss and 2 at the end
---
He found a (time machine)[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Forever]
---
I might as well would be interested in some cool looking spec op bunker camp items alltough even then most probably i wouldn‚Äôt start building a camp again üòÇ
---
Umm... guarantee how exactly? Source?
---
Cause Seasons isn't out yet and if it was out on the PTS, it hasn't been out long enough for anyone to get to rank 100 as far as I'm aware.
---
Absolutely - although I've discovered that you don't need to get all four crates to get the Blue Ridge Caravan rewards, but getting the 120 caps is a plus.
---
Angry turtle is by far the most informative about weapons and builds. I enjoy rifle gamings videos too.
---
So you don't spend the atoms you do get because there isn't anything worth buying... and yet you can't identify THAT as being the problem?
---
But what if my friend wants one but cant play as much as i do and i unlock it
---
Kevduit is funny but everything he does is neatly summarized o0n his website including the stupid OP builds he makes.
---
Thanks silver lining guy.
---
Kevduit isn‚Äôt really a guide youtuber but if you want a laugh he‚Äôs good
---
You can get score from public events and XP.. if you wanted you could just endlessly grind XP after completing your challenges for the day/week and up your score by as much as you are willing to play and put the time in.
---
Wonderful lighting!
---
I‚Äôve done this event prob 200 times and never has the order changed up like that
---
I make different builds based off the stupidest ideas and concepts i can think of.
---
And i forgot to mention that the only reason i took fallout first was the tent with scrap box and to have a more stable server when the raids were still active and so i can move mid tier and scrip stuff to a different char without needing a friend for it
---
It 100% won't be purified. Purified water sells to vendors.
---
Innovsurvivalist regularly uploads, the content is good aswell
---
Fuck that guy and those like him
---
Apparently it's "cosmetic only"
---
I have been talking about him not being important or relevant as an individual character for quite some time now, which you still disagree with.
---
Never played NHL 20 huh? That game is pretty much a remake of the year before, which was a remake of the year prior, and so on. EA is the same greedy company as Bethesda, just a different name.
---
Ah. So you really don't have a clue. Got it.
---
Never played NHL 20 huh? That game is pretty much a remake of the year before, which was a remake of the year prior, and so on. EA is the same greedy company as Bethesda, just a different name. Yeah
---
Oh, the order of the crates never changes, but the actual locations (where they are placed) are random within the location. Sometimes they'll be in a side tunnel or they could be just placed on the side of the tunnel.
---
But, it doesn't take too long to find them.
---
Only had a bug a couple of times where one of the crates never spawned - I mean, we scoured every inch of the tunnel &amp; it just wasn't there.
---
If i recall, waves are sent out every time the Queen lands, so when she dies and her corpse lands, and that may be registering as a new "wave" sendout.
---
That is awesome.  I have spoke to him but never long enough to get his full story.  I'm from New Haven, CT.  I'll have to interact with this NPC tonight after work now.  Thanks for the post.
---
Build a ledge about 3 stories up.  Place her chair at the very edge so when she stands up she falls off and gets hurt.  She will limp around for a few min and usually just reappear at the chair again.  She is much quieter now.
---
Yup, this is as good as it gets.
---
Finally got it beat the other day! Not solo lol Thx for the info about the keycard I already bought one not knowing your first time is free. All good though ill do it twice more
---
All I am unhappy about mainly is the high level caps/scrip/gold rewards.
---
2500 caps is so damn easy to farm.
---
50 gold ... seriously?
---
100 scrip??!! I don't even bother farming legendaries anymore and you will find plenty of people selling 3 star legendaries for under 300 gold because theire stash can't keep up with the weight anymore.
---
Don't make me grind 100+ hours to get to level 53 and receive 2500 caps. Rather give me atoms or a skin.
---
I would assume since it was spinning initially, that it will spin again. Shame about it not serving a purpose beyond aesthetics... missed opportunity.
---
It's a random event spawn - the dialogue I got was that something was chasing them....then a group of Super Mutants showed up. Once I killed them, the dialogue changed, he thanked me &amp; gave me a small reward for saving them.
---
Thanks!  That‚Äôs all this was about. Your original comment was that complaints about him being mentioned in this sub were valid. 
---
But they aren‚Äôt. Because in the context and requirements of this sub, House is relevant. You‚Äôve even admitted this. 
---
Everything past that is you trying to muddy the waters and have a different discussion about his level of relevance or his comparative relevance to other characters. 
---
Mentioning him in this sub is relevant. End of story. 
---
Thanks for playing!  Better luck next time!
---
I've had fallout first for 3 months and spent on atoms.... Just cause your broke dont mean we all are.... People already spend now they are putting the squeeze on us..... Might have to find a new game.
---
If you have to ask that question, maybe you need to step away from the game until more content drops.
---
I don't need to make the game fun. The content I still have yet to complete is making it fun for me.
---
Omg I love this picture! The blood! Oh look out behind you! Jumping mothman
---
Send a report after patch 20 :) is the best way
---
Unyielding is substantially better than Bolstering - just like Vanguard isn't a great perk, because of the diminishing returns at the higher DR / ER.
---
So you're just gunna dismiss criticism of the game as "people who've probably never played the game"? Seems a little childish my dude. 
---
Consumers arent "spoiled brats". They're your customers. They have no obligation towards your products and if you want to continue making money from them, especially in the games industry, you listen to their criticisms and give feedback, and actively engage in the community.
---
If they acted like you do, they'd have no customers left to sell products to.
---
Thanks, I was not aware of the diminishing return.
---
I would love this. I have completed all the active questlines atm and I am at level 117, and already feel its mostly grinding and repetitive dailies left. This would improve playability drastically.
---
Idea; It could be a daily quest, where you get up to 10 waves of enemies. First ones could be animals, supermutants, scorched/ghouls, robots. This way everyone could get to use their specific builds/weapon effects, from there it gets drastically harder. To challenge even experienced players wave 10 should be next to impossible, maybe even add a special weapon/armor/plan you cant get anywhere else. If i at the beginning ONLY could complete 6 waves and had to build/plan to complete the rest, IT would be awesome. An actual challenge. Something to grind for.
---
Thoughts?
---
These is the same people who paid for f01 and now want to bitch about it...if people can't see Beth is run by cash grab after cash grab their blind. I just want Beth to sell fallout at this point.  If you played 1 and 2 you know they're fucking poor imitators at their best.  Greedy assholes at their worst apparently.
---
I got tired of looking for the supplies so I just quit doing it one day.  I have still gotten the caravan cosmetic rewards.  I think grabbing the supplies gives you a few more caps though.
---
Ha. Take my upvote!
---
:D
---
Yes bugs do occur occasionally but 4 crates in the beginning nah I call bs that just doesn‚Äôt happen
---
No it really hasn't been. It was satirical yes but not into the realm of the ridiculous like the random xd skins we see all over in 76.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can place atomic shop itmes
---
They are random but they still appear in certain areas. One of them is always before the 1st fighting area.  One of them is always down the big tunnel where the boss is. Two of them are always past the gate where the boss is.
---
 I have probly ran this event 50 times so it takes me less than a couple minutes to find them all. It's not so random once you know all the random spots.
---
Are you sure ?
---
 If I would have read further down the thread I would have seen your post.
---
They have spawn groups one always being before the captain. The second beind down the tunnel and the thrid and 4th are at like 3 difderent locations each. 
---
For a pro tip if you stand beside where the dogs spawn after the captain, if standing correctly you can make all the dogs spawn on top of themselves instantly. Makes killing them super fast.
---
Bethesda has said towards the higher levels, "each level is roughly equal to two hours of gameplay" or something to that effect, for whatever that means.
---
The American flag on sale on the Atomic Shop rn has a monochrome version of it, that I at least find very Enclave esque.
---
But yes, we need a proper flag too.
---
I want the real Mothman. Not the mutated moths that the cultist worship.  Ingrid Cole would be a fun boss fight with a bunch of his mutated minions.
---
Also this event is an excellent source for stimpacks
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started on that thing... I run full X-01 (highest energy DR besides T-65) and that thing kills me so goddamn fast...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It's either just shooting the shit in a general chat with inane conversations or actual useful stuff to do with trading items. That's it.
---
So true... I don't load the Chat Mod anymore because I was tired of the same bunch of players speaking of the weather or their dog on the Global channel and was tired of having to deactivate it after each server hop.
---
I don‚Äôt care if he as a specific individual is part of the game. I care if he is relevant to FO76 (and more specifically per the rules of this sub, connected to the game). 
---
The unnamed NPC panning for gold is connected to the game. A post about him would be within the rules of this sub. Because that character is connected to the game.
---
That‚Äôs been my entire point all along. He has sufficient connection and relevance to FO76 to qualify for discussion here. 
---
Feel free to argue any other point you want. Those are all secondary to the primary point generated by your original comment. And I don‚Äôt care about any of those. I only care about the original and singular point. 
---
**House has a sufficient relevance and connection to this game to be a topic of discussion in this sub.**
---
I had that with a chicken chasing them.
---
Also had someones Beckett do some cross country out in the middle of nowhere. "What was that?" "Can I get ya anything?".
---
I hadn‚Äôt rolled a single unyielding for over two weeks straight of only rolling SS armor limbs. Last night I spent about 25 modules and completed my set of full unyielding. All unyielding arms and legs from the same world. I‚Äôm convinced some worlds have a higher affinity for certain prefixes.
---
And add crown molding
---
No items can be placed from the atomic shop except the deer horn chandelier from the nuclear winter challenges
---
There are a few bugged ones but I am very sure
---
Delete their camp item
---
I remember the only time I went to a trapped CAMP was through fast travel and I happened to spawn inside the guy‚Äôs base, past all the traps

It is pretty unbalanced. They have a lot that needs to be fixed, i honestly doubt itll be fixed anytime soon. Lol
---
The Fixer? What is that, a power tool of some sort? Why would anyone use that over a cOMbAt RiFLe!?
---
Yeah and we don‚Äôt have to grind for it either! It‚Äôs a tier 5 reward! Say goodbye to your useless .38 rounds and missiles!
---
Fallout 76 needs this and legit any new content right now, I want to play but dam it‚Äôs boring and added stupid challenges and a battle pass ain‚Äôt gonna not make me bored of the game ya know
---
If you want to Roleplay you need some "Game Master", i.e. someone controlling what is going on, implementing rules and story plots and banning cheaters and griefers. The current server architecture (free + public + non persistent + no server mods) is not compatible.
---
I've turned off global and trading and all I see is very very rarely the EU chat come to life for a short moment like a couple of times a week.
---
I get the sense you haven't used the mod for a while. You can permanently turn off channels you don't want to see.
---
They will make you pay more if you want extra stuff( whip cream, toppings etc.) which is exactly the same thing you can buy the base game and never pay another dime and still be able to do everything ingame theres nothing that you can pay for except cosmetics and QOL things
---
Aren‚Äôt they doing that already ? If not I really hope so
---
My understanding is that it was said in an interview that they were considering changes like instead of having negative effects for not eating/drinking, it would just give you the buffs. This has not been confirmed officially and there is no timetable on it that I have seen.
---
It appears that people like u/Enunimes enjoy the game more from community validation rather than self-validation. u/Owl_No [asked the crucial question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hg2dyg/so_has_everyone_just_forgotten_that_the_game_was/fw1phti?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I think a good PvP thing would kinda be like the Gulag from COD. Raiders run it like an arena and you can 1v1 or 2v2
---
People have repeatedly suggested possible atomic store content over the past year and a half, and there are some definite themes. Even if they‚Äôre just as simple as ‚Äòmake skins for the weapons that people actually use.‚Äô 
---
Not knowing what we want is a defunct excuse by now, I‚Äôm afraid. Even if it were still true, Bethesda could easily illuminate themselves by simply asking the question.
---
CT in the building!
---
You‚Äôll get better!
---
*PC*
---
Actually, don‚Äôt even bother.
---
The rewards from the season are way better than 90% of the crap they put in the Atom Shop anyway.
---
No one is forcing you to play it.   Don't like it?  Then don't play it.  Sorry you can't have this,  it hurts,  I know
---
I could actually go visit this place. I should show up and stare at my Pip boy for an hour before leaving.
---
This bug has been reported long before FO76 was available on Steam. Happened to me once and I had to close and reload game.
---
If you're on PC, you can download the text chat mod from nexus. It's pretty active and makes playing the game more "lively" since you're able to chat with people.
---
I think duping ruins the experience for players of finding their own stuff. I remember my first explosive gun I have and I was stoked!!!  
---
It also wrecks the economy in the game by de-valuing all the non meta gear.  The meta gear should be rare and extremely valuable imo.
---
Hopefully i can be recommended someday by someone other than myself, but Nightin Gery is my youtube name and i covered all wastelanders items except the gauss pistol, and still do guides and even news sometimes on 76 and plan to do ao for the foreseeable future. If you want to give me a chance, check it out, you wont find clickbait from me.
---
Who do you buy this armor from??
---
I run the same setup as you and went Unyielding, the SS armor adds some much needed tankiness all on it's own.
---
Anywhere in the mire and the cranberry bog is good pickings; your main problem will be High Radiation fluid as it is the rarest component in crafting stable flux.
---
To farm high rad fluids/glowing mass/hardened mass, nuke the Whitespring Resort and farm the ghouls that spawn. Repeat until you get all of the other ingredients you need
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but it's only extra caps, right? 
---
And yeah if you want them wait until the middle bit, kill everyone and go find them. Then open the gate.
---
Then buy her a PS4 and a copy.
---
Not only will you earn some brownie points, you'll be able to help her on the road to levelling up, will be a protector, will be able to experience the changes made with Wastelanders, and be able to play loads of other awesome games together.
---
Or buy yourself an Xbox, if you hate yourself. üòÅ
---
It's a random event. No way to force it to start.
---
Since Wastelanders dropped, I've seen it go up EXACTLY once.
---
I gave up on it and just traded to get the stuff I wanted from that event.
---
Oh I wondered why I never see it
---
Most of those making false claims usually have less than an hour, notably those with 0 after Wastelanders drop
---
Of course, and I don't mean act like I do I'm just annoyed at the sheer amount of people nit picking and falsifying shit
---
The grind should be for the level up, not to grind up cards you already earned.
---
The last thing to think of in such a moment is taking a photo... :D
---
I don't care about the 40 extra caps so I don't bother with them.
---
Literally just stay with the cows and defend them. Dont bother finding the optional loot crates, theynonly net you 10 caps each and add like 5 minutes to the event. Pretty sure they dont count towards rewards. I never collect them anymore and still get the plans and outfits.
---
Oooh
---
Haha, if only we had the money...
---
Yeah, mid-300s seems to be the sweet spot, and higher doesn't really help all that much...plus you still have to worry about the high DPS enemies, like Super Mutants with miniguns &amp; Col. Gutsies, who seem to chew through your health
---
This. It adds like 5 minutes to the event for 40 caps.
---
combine rustic with mothman stuff?
---
Thats so cool. It's why I loved New Vegas. Being from nevada it was Cool to see such a well done recreation of what youre used to.
---
Go to the big bend tunnel east and speak to vinny, the mission should start. If not server hop and try until he says perfect timing. 
---
When the mission starts, protect the brahmin, you can solo it with no difficulty assuming you have a half sensible build. 
---
What do you need help with exactly?
---
That's not true. If it has been run in the last 45 minutes (or so), it has a cool down timer. Any player can start the quest. you need to start it by talking to Vinny Costa.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Riding\_Shotgun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Riding_Shotgun)
---
Instigating if fine as long as :
---
- you can one shot (eventually two) the mobs
---
- you are clearing the place alone
---
- your second effect is NOT explosive (or you will break the instigating effect for mobs too close from the first target)
---
My sneaky "full health" rifleman build use two lever action rifles:
---
- one instigating + 10% more damage while aiming, good for the "sniper" part of the action.
---
- one Anti Armor + Faster Fire Rate for bigger (and armored) mobs.
---
In effect I use the instigating on the first shot, then, if the mob is still alive I switch to the other gun.
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure if it‚Äôs RNG or not but I did 20 runs of each. no crates, 1,2,3,4 crates with the max crates I got 5 more plans/outfits then with the lesser amounts. So take what u want from that.
---
IMO it‚Äôs better odds or else why would it even be in there. Nobody cares about an extra 20 caps
---
Not true, you need to speak to vinny at big bend east to start it.
---
Even gearbox don‚Äôt talk about the presequel.
---
This is too meta.
---
When they add adventure mode rewards in a different game mode they are indeed trying to force you to play that mode.
---
 It's really not that hard to understand.
---
I had pretty good timing by making my melee alt when hourly Faschnact and the last double XP weekend happened. Up to level 35 was a decent breeze, though getting to 50+ after it all was a drag, yeah.
---
Tried to avoid doing the Wastelander main quest, but ended up doing it for the Chinese Stealth Armor so I could stealth whack with an Instigating Super Sledge. Good times.
---
Just wanted to know how to start it and what to do
---
They should just do what f2p SWTOR does. When you reach max currency, anything more money you get is put into an escrow.
---
That way, you technically don't lose the money, and the economy doesn't destroy itself.
---
That said, they'd need to make it work without a subscription model (withdrawing 1400 a day is a very good idea for this)
---
I have never had an issue on Xbox, and I buy from him every week on either Sunday or Monday. Not sure what‚Äôs causing this for some of you.
---
Juice head is very good
---
Have you checked out Oxhorns recent video on youtube? He did a mock newscast about it!
---
Why is it disingenuous to release the cosmos stuff on the shop?
---
I've ran it over a hundred times by now, both with and without grabbing the crates. I still need the backpack plan and flag I think. 
---
I'm reasonably sure that the two outfits and gas mask I have I got from solo runs where I never bothered with the crates.
---
Get yourself a set of troubleshooters armor and a vampire's minigun or other high speed weapon and you, too, can become an Angry Turtle who solos the Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
Lol I'm a fanboi now.
---
I did read what you had to say, infact.
---
He's a random dude. üòÇüòÇ
---
Holy shit dude, it's insane the lengths you will go to, to be right.
---
The founder of Robco, pretty much all the robots in the game, and he's a random dude üòÇ
---
You have to dig deep for any lore in these games outside of what's put right in front of you. Yet that doesn't make that lore irrelevant.
---
It's not a difficult concept to grasp, but you'll just spout out things like "I know I'm right" or WRITE THINGS IN CAPS BECAUSE THAT GIVES YOU EXTRA RIGHT POINTS.
---
At the end of the day, you'll repeat yourself ad naseum because your argument is paper thin (which is why you do the above - to you its undeniable logic).
---
I totally get what you're saying by the way. It's just ludicrous.
---
House is an Easter egg üòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks for the laugh üòÇ
---
I never really said that this makes things so different. My point was that this represents yet another system designed to create a meta experience rather than an immersive worldspace experience, layering on top of the cash shop, and to me it represents Bethesda going deeper and deeper into real money/hamster wheel mechanics while adding almost nothing new to the base game in 1.5 years.
---
So I'm not saying hey, everything has now changed suddenly and it's bad. What I'm saying is, it's been bad for a year and a half and this new system isn't helping, and adds another layer of meta/grind that substitutes finding cool new items in the world with watching your progress on some disconnected board game until a reward drops into your inventory from the ether.
---
Nothing they're doing with rewards has increased immersion or enhanced the fundamental practices of scavenging and trading. And as I mentioned, this wouldn't be a problem if we had a trickle of new rewards added to the base game, but there's simply no indication from them that this will ever happen. :/
---
It‚Äôs a free progression system that gives you tons of cosmetics camp items and other in game stuff it‚Äôs basically a free battle pass the first one comes June 30th
---
Gotcha, well now you know, it's as simple as that really.
---
After a few runs you'll know exactly what to do.
---
I always have 2/4 crates before the first encounter and I am always back by the first hole in the wall waiting for it to explode, if I wasn't usually solo I could have all 4 before the blockade, easily.
---
Must be a slow gaming news day at Forbes.
---
Every character is a random dude to every new player, by the way.
---
That argument is less than paper thin.
---
Its hard to compare, they are more or less on the same level of technology. JHE had 200 years to become what he is, Vault 51 ZAX has only over 25 years on his clock so far and still plenty to lern. 
---
We dont know what ZAX will do or become in 200 years.
---
.....what?
---
How did you get him indoors?
---
Mine is CLASSYxPEGASUS. I'll be on later today, I'll message you when I am to see if you're on. I can do the mod for you whenever, so just let me know if you're ready when you see me onüòä
---
you go into the atomic shop and select a different icon. you will know it is equipped when you see a check mark in the corner of that icon
---
Has a hidden( datamined)  30% faster fire rate and reload.
---
Currently cant be modded, or repaired at the work bench.
---
Yes I have 3.
---
This is incorrect. You can start it by talking to the guy standing outside of the cave, he has a coffee in his hands.  You can very easily farm Riding Shotgun by server hopping,  I know because I do.
---
I got lucky the other say and found 47 HRF fluids in a vendor.  
---
Better than a bloodied fixer.
---
Go into the atomic shop and look for icons, there you can change it
---
Are you sure? A quick screenshot and I'll delete this post.
---
If you want shorter lore videos check out Widgeon TV. I‚Äôve watched a few and they are entertaining. 
---
I‚Äôll double down on angry turtle. Very informative, shows uncommon knowledge about builds, legendaries, Perks, etc. so you can actually mess around in the game and actually have fun using random weapons and playing instead of just grinding for good legendary rolls.
---
I would recommend picking up a set of low level unyielding, the agi should keep you in sneak more often and the extra int will reward with more xp. Even if you do decide to move away from unyielding in the future, it is one of the best for leveling ime.
---
From the rainbow icon?
---
Best way? Trade for it with someone that has a ton! 
---
My play time is limited with work and family, and when I do get time to play, farming is usually not the thing I'm interested in doing. 
---
I have found a few reputable players who have a lot of flux and will offer them trades in weapons, armor, junk and ammo for it.
---
Don't listen to this person they are wrong.
---
You can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre gay forever
---
I just spent the past few days trying to get a character to 50 myself and it was all Whitesprings to Huntersville and Westek,stop off at the steakhouse for a quick bite before heading to the Glasses Caverns
---
And holy hell, even on a public server at level 47 Nothing would spawn above 22-32 albeit for the occasional 48 and rare 68.
---
It's definitely a PITA to level these days.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. Have also treasure hunter outfit and cap
---
I am beyond 100% sure. And I'm not currently on.
---
What do you mean ?
---
What‚Äôs a good strategy to finding that? I was thinking about it. 15 extra points of int is nothing to disregard!
---
Alright, I'll take your word for it. Thanks and be safe
---
Np. Same to you.
---
Some really nice shots! Please continue. I love Fallout photography, and I especially enjoy the real-time challenge of action shots in Fallout 76 over previous games where you could freeze time with console commands. I have a gallery [here](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery) if you are interested and I'm also happy to help if you have any questions.
---
Yea I've had them multiple times. I scrap them or sell them because they are useless to me.
---
You can start this event by talking to Vinny outside the tunnel. He has a coffee in his hands.
---
If Vinnie says it's not time to start yet server hop and most likely the next server you get on it will be ready to start by talking to him
---
He's given me a good laugh üòÅ
---
I'm done with it now, life is too short for this haha
---
Oof, but it‚Äôs not like the regular one has mods either.
---
Delete your post
---
Oh okay I‚Äôll try this
---
Have you lost your pride already ;-)
---
You do it from the atomic shop interface, go into the icons section and click on a different one that you have access to.
---
lol imagine singing it lkie mary poppins,"Its a bloodied recoil compensated ultracite lazer rifle".
---
Good luck! I have farmed this event and received all the rewards by server hopping.
---
I hope I will get them !!
---
When my first kid was born, I was working a 4p-2a shift at work. I would get home and do all the night feedings with my boy and stay up until my wife woke up (usually around 7am) before tagging out and going to bed.
---
As I was up doing feedings, changings, playing, and interacting with the baby, I did a complete playthrough of Skyrim.
---
When my second child was born, I did the same thing with Fallout 4. 
---
This way I was able to spend a lot of time with my newborn while working a crappy hour shift at work and still get some gaming time in!.
---
Good luck! Being a dad has been the best part of my life to date!
---
"The gay"...?
---
They add no time to the event at all if you know where you are looking, its also an extra 50% total cap reward, so its definitely worth finding them. Once you know where they are, you can find the first 2 before the first encounter even starts (ie. while waiting for the guides to finish talking) and you can get the last 2 after you open the red gate, while waiting for the guides to walk their slow asses to the next encounter.
---
I jsut wish the store had good enough items. I've only bought fo1st for this game but I've spent I don't want to admit how much on games like LoL probably more than a thousand. That's just to say how I either have little hope for the game or the skins aren't good enough.
---
I will probably use my gillie suit to bush wookie through the NW score challenges, making it easier to get the new armor skins.
---
I finally got the Gauss Shotgun but it is only doing 672 damage; what are the specs on your Gauss Shotgun and what perk cards are you using?  Thanks.
---
Is there a joke in his comment somewhere that I‚Äôm too old to understand?
---
The vegetarian with the chicken phobia? That one got me good. It led up with some spooky effects like when you're about to see a Deathclaw or something and it's just a friggin chicken lol.
---
"I know I'm right"
---
"wrong, yet again"
---
You should run for president. How could anyone argue with you, when you know you're right and everyone else is wrong!?
---
I lol'd way too hard at this xD
---
My father asked Sanjay why is your logo the gay and I said I didn't do it but he said he didn't believe me and unfortunately beat me very badly
---
Don't feel bad, I was just about to recommend you :D P.S. Cool art as well ü§†
---
If you want the extra caps there's always one supply crate before the bosses gated area.  There's always one crate down the tunnel that is inside the bosses gated area. There are always 2 crates past the gated area.
---
They can either be found in the main tunnel or the side tunnels off the main tunnel. Once you get all the random spots down it takes a couple minutes to find them all.
---
 If you find all 4 crates you gain 120 caps per event, not too shabby.
---
Seems like a good investment
---
Ahahah yeah that's the one, I prepped real quick, 50 cal up, dash of psycho aaaand.... chicken. Single chicken. Nice.
---
And the ring of Fire pit. Don‚Äôt forget that. And the satellite, unless that got patched.
---
It holds as much of whatever junk you want. If you can‚Äôt fill it with thousands of junk items that people use, that doesn‚Äôt mean that other people didn‚Äôt do it.
---
So the shotgun is a 2 shot weapon and it has 33 vats hit chance so I don‚Äôt know if that deals more damage . I also have all the shotgun perks and also demolition expert maxed . I‚Äôm also a bloodied build
---
The raise of the cap limit only does good. Everything 1:1 like ammo will stay the same and some items will now be tradable for caps. 50k goes a lot further than 30k.
---
You‚Äôre either very serious or you‚Äôre amazing at making shitposts
---
I bought my set for a fairly low price actually. If youre rolling for it you would have to have a low level scrip mule
---
Thanks man, that means a lot! Haha
---
1) Check to see if there is a trader / Caravan Guard at Big Bend Tunnel East (Y/N)
---
2) If Yes, go talk to Vinny &amp; let him know you are there to guard the caravan.
---
3) Get inside the tunnel &amp; speak to the Caravan Guard to get the event start.
---
4) Guard the Brahmin through the tunnel
---
Fight #1 - when the caravan reaches the first checkpoint, you will be attacked by Blood Eagles from the front (starting with a dog), followed by at least a dog &amp; two Blood Eagles from the rear.
---
Fight #2 - You'll reach a small barricade. While the caravan guard places explosives, you'll need to guard the Brahmin. You will be attacked from behind &amp; from a side tunnel on the right-hand side.
---
Fight #3 - when you proceed, the caravan will enter a large room with catwalks. There will be multiple enemies, including dogs. The Boss will be a 1-3\* Blood Eagle Captain with a Minigun on the catwalk directly ahead of you. Once you've killed all the enemies (and the Captain), you will need to get up on the catwalk and push a button to open the gate to allow the caravan to pass.
---
Fight #4 - as the caravan moves forward in the tunnel, a group of dogs will spawn in the right-hand side tunnel and attack. Kill them as the caravan continues to travel forward (it won't stop for this fight).
---
Fight #5 - you'll reach another open area &amp; get ambushed by Blood Eagles. They will attack from both the front and the rear - with the rear attacking first. It is good to have one player cover the rear and another in front. Once you've cleared the enemies, the caravan will run to the tunnel exit and the event will end.
---
Optional Objective - collect Blue Ridge Supply Crates left in the tunnels. These will be crates found in the following areas
---
1) Somewhere between the first and second checkpoints / fights. Sometimes in a side tunnel to the left or in the tunnel to the right (or side tunnel with mole miners.
---
2) Always down the left-hand side tunnel at the Mid-Boss fight (Blood Eagle Captain). Go down the tunnel to the left with the mole miners in it - you'll find the second crate in one of three possible locations.

3) Between the Captain Fight area and the ambush site, you'll find the 3rd crate somewhere on the right side of the tunnel (either near the shack you find or in a small side alcove).
---
4) Last crate will be around the final ambush site, in either on the side tunnels (right or left).
---
Note - you do not need to get all the crates or any to get max rewards. Keeping the Brahmin alive does that. The additional crates will add caps to the final reward total, with a potential of 120 should you get all four.
---
Hope this helps.

Prime receiver adds alot of damage

I'm quite bored at the moment, so between running events and stuff, I've been finding low level players and observing them from afar in my stealth suit, if they seem like a new player, I might follow them around and shoot some mobs in front of them, always fun to see them looking around in confusion. The other thing I like to do is sneak into buildings theyre exploring and hide somewhere, then pop out on them, alwas gets a good reaction too.
---
If it were in WV, it would also probably be a third of the price.
---
I picked those up as soon as I hit the reputation for it . They are a life changer
---
Stop and look around you sometimes, make liberal use of spamming vats to help locate him. I've read multiple times that the non-hostile Mothman that will flee if you get too close actually follows you around from a distance watching you in world. I don't know if that's true but I've spotted the Mothman multiple times doing just that.
---
Umm... sure bud...
---
Same. Once u have a routine it‚Äôs easily soloed
---
I don't think it's about the price, people buy skins on league that are worth 25$+ all the time, if the skin is nice and you feel the game is worth it a lot of people will pay. I don't like  maybe of the things bethesda does. Point 2 is one of the ones I hate the most and the other is that they place the really cool stuff in bundles and say I buy something inn the bundle and then a week later it's in the bundle well the bundles isn't cheaper now so if I want that 1 item in the bundle I'll be paying for some items twice. That's actually fked up
---
They should have optional challenges so you can choose between a Normal or NW challenge. Then people can pick which they want and nobody's forced to play a mode they don't want.
---
Once you‚Äôve romanced Beckett, the gay icon can‚Äôt be changed. At least you have an overly attractive boyfriend now.
---
super sledgehammer for the win, I got mine at lvl 30 modes and I'm on lvl 48 with the same one doing massive amount of damage, love it, gonna change only on lv50 tho
---
Another tip: if you don't open the gate you are free to roam the entire area searching for the crates.  The caravan won't move until you open that gate and nobody will attack them if you killed all the enemies in the area.
---
It would be cool if half the legendary perks weren't just added inconvenience at the end of yet another grind. Who really wants to have the corpses of their enemies explode away from them, or to have to wear 1 weight of armor to get a bonus that is supposed to exemplify epic levels.
---
I'll agree with that. A majority of the content in the season rewards doesn't interest me, but if it was just something else to work towards getting, I'd be cool with it. But since it's something to work towards, while no longer being able to get all the Atoms we *used* to be able to work towards, it's frustrating.
---
I dont agree. I pay for fo1st, and every Tuesday I average 50$ in additional atoms and I do daily/weekly have been for a couple yrs (fo1st for about 6-8m) so it's a subjective opinion that I dont agree.
---
U on Xbox?
---
You do you. Not worth 40 caps to me. I know the crate and enemy spawn points.  Enemies spawn in the same sport every time. I run the event usually 3x a night. Have a nice rhythm i fallow and same spots to sit in for each section to be efficient as possible.
---
Damn, looks like a hole to the abyss opened up, just so the mothman could swing by and rend the flesh off your bones :o
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it alot, but yes. It does add some damage
---
You will once you get there and see what i mean.
---
Nah I'm on PC mate.
---
...then why did you claim it's free to play, when it's not..?
---
I‚Äôve had the non hostile one show up 4-5 times off in the distance in my 300 ish hrs like near the trees or on a rock or something and as soon as I get near it poof gone
---
Like many things in this game, it used to be better.  They've increased the grind.
---
I've spent over 1900 hours in this game.  I have loved the journey for the most part, but their choices since launch have been a real mixed bag.
---
I don't watch that much Fallout 76 YouTube but I usually watch Rifle Gaming when I do, it's pretty good stuff.
---
I have been waiting for years for someone to catch me in a trap camp built around a nukashine bottle but no one has yet. Please, trap camp makers, make my wish come true one day
---
Pretty sure that's just a myth. People always look for patterns in the rng which makes coincidence seem like it's intentional. But I crafted every single piece of armor at around 15 health and half by pieces were unyielding on the first roll. For the others, I didn't roll a single piece more than 6 times to get unyielding
---
Not true, you can force a Mothman spawn at Charleston station. Map there and run south to the train bridge, step onto it then turn around and go check behind the shed to your right. A random encounter will spawn here and one of the possibilities is a Mothman. Don't get too close or draw a weapon though because it will flee since it's not a vengeful Mothman.
---
A battle bass?  Sounds fishy to me.
---
Cool pfp
---
They will add a season pass this 30th and after two weeks you will be able to spend 150 atoms to rank up a level but it's not worth it.
---
&gt;I could care less about it
---
So you DO care about Mothman.  Why the thread then?
---
It's not worth it. Collecting the crates only get you more caps at the end of the event. It doesnt effect your chances of getting good rewards.
---
well the 2 things worth having from the shop is the collector and repair kits so can be worth tho
---
I've found leveling new toons to be easier each time for learning from prior mistakes
---
You‚Äôre on PS4, right! How about an Anti Armor Limb Damage +50 DR while aiming fancy pumpaction shotgun? (I know it is a mouthful.)
---
"Bethesda's vague mention of it taking 150 hours of gameplay to finish all 100 ranks"
---
"We have essentially ZERO information"
---
I had to spam that a few times so you'd understand how absurd your response is. You answered your own question: Bethesda gave us an estimation and they have nothing to gain by making it seem worse than it is, so I'm being gracious by taking their word as reliable. It's possible the grind will be more like 200-300 hours for casual players, but either way, it's too much grind for me in context of the overall lack of baseline, in-game reward updates (which btw is the point of the post).
---
I'm comfortable using Bethesda's own words on this and that is not 'essentially ZERO' information... at all. What a hilarious thing to claim.
---
As far as the cost, you could have done the thinking on that one yourself if you weren't so busy getting worked up.
---
100 ranks @ 150 atoms per rank = 15000 atoms. Confirmed factual information.
---
4000 atoms for $50 CAD, x4 = 16000 atoms for $200 CAD. Confirmed factual information.
---
I don't mind counterpoints or alternate views, but you're being aggressively lazy with this post.
---
Enemy spawns are normally the same, but their spawns do move around if they are obstructed by another player. Thats when they kinda move around a bit. But you can reliably predict their movement pattern from several locations along the trail. Like forcing all enemies to rush in a single direction when you are waiting for the charges to blow. If you stand in the cave before it blows open the door almost no enemies will spawn in the cave and you will just have to deal with enemies running near the train cart.
---
So you may get lucky and he chooses to spawn there. Again he meets you.
---
Server hop abandoned bog town for the behemoth/workshop. 400-500exp for him, 200-300 to clear enemies and 300 for workshop claim. Takes about 5-10mins per server hop giving you just over 1000exp per run
---
My thoughts exactly. I love being able to change my look up based on what area I'm exploring, weather, time of day... whatever, and I wouldn't be able to do that with an armor skin. My options would be either pick one look to be stuck with at all times, Ghillie or regular, or try to carry full sets of both...which would be wildly impractical even just for how much they'd weigh, let alone how difficult it'd be to get *two* full sets of decent legendaries. But with the outfit version? Headpiece and outfit are both 0.1 lbs, which is hardly anything, so I can carry those around with me everywhere no problem, and can just throw it on whenever I might happen to feel like it.
---
How many runs did u do when you tested it?
---
OP doesn‚Äôt bother with hits that deal &lt;100 dps ... meanwhile, I‚Äôm hitting like 7-12 on avg (when it‚Äôs in the sky), and then 40-70 when it‚Äôs on the ground... 
---
jeez, makes me reconsider going for a bloody build.
---
I was levelling another alt for science by capturing as many workshops as possible. The i don't defend and instead wait for the retake quest. I then fill in the time by running the athletics source at sunnytop ski lanes. It's like 500xp a time plus rewards and takes like a minute if that. 
---
I was doing this on a private so at one point i had like 13-14  workshops going.
---
I can safely say at least well over 50. Probably close to 100
---
Would love to have this as an opt-in PvP thing. Fuck, make it cross server so you don't have to hope that 3 other people want to do it like hunter/hunted
---
I honestly would recommend going on YouTube and just watching a guide. The Mask and Clothing are rare rewards for doing the event, so be prepared to do a bit of farming. This event is not random, and can be farmed via server hoping. Good luck!
---
If they removed the ability to just camp in the stands so nobody can attack you, sure.
---
The idea behind the quest was neat but it was pretty easy to cheese.
---
This is one of my favorite things about fallout I've gotten so lucky with the place where theese games take place

I've been playing since beta, and I only found out like 2 weeks ago, I think the guy that told me said their was a 3rd key too for rediculious fast scroll but I forgot what it was. Maybe tab or alt. But since I found out I can't stop telling people. THIS HAS TO BE KNOWN!
---
I already have 11 characters which are lvl 50+, my main is 370, my other 4 builds are all between 150-200 and then i have 6 more mule accounts between lvl 50-60. 
---
Even without double xp it takes approx 1 hour to lvl up until 50
---
I guess you're just stupid and misunderstood?
---
The context of this thread is the atom shop supporting the game as a revenue stream.  My post is that Bethesda is providing tons of new content to the game, for free.  Even without anything new added by them, there's costs associated with hosting the servers and storing user information.  Again that's free.
---
Sleep for well rested boost, do path to enlightenment event for boosted xp, feed the people event for meat stew to further boost xp, then grind Charleston Capitol Building. You'll lvl very quickly
---
Grind for Treasury Notes to get bullion to buy stuff - and grind reputation with the factions to max it out for more stuff to buy.
---
Okay
---
I hope so
---
have you used the blueprint trick to get more on a tile?
---
When will they make the only mod that matters.. thot companions :(
---
I didn‚Äôt say it can‚Äôt happen
---
Continuing to earn treasury notes especially with the three dailies and purchasing up to a total of $5,000 gold bullion can get to some nice armor and weapons. Any event that pops up with the exclamation point in it will earn you a treasury note or more.
---
Haha thanks for pointing that out! We'll get that fixed up.
---
Oh man, I feel the same way. I'd be thrilled to take my C.A.M.P. companion out with me on adventures! If the coding is similar or the same for fo4, it's can be implemented. Companions and settlement building were my favorite aspects of the previous game, especially the little comments on places you visit, things they approve of or disapprove of... 
---
Luckily when you visit someone's camp, you no longer see the companion's name, but "player name's ally", so if Bethesda makes this a possibility, you won't see 10 "Commanders" or 10 "Beckett"s, and you'll be able to identify your own ally.  Also keeping them as they are, i.e. only changing clothing on them would keep them from being pack mules to bypass our weight limits. 
---
It's also fairly simple (considdering it's added into fo4 via mods) to make them target only creatures that cause damage to you, or whatever you damage. Also making them do no damage to other players if pvp is initiated. This would help with keeping them from wandering off to kill a radroach half a mile away or be used to benefit players engaged in pvp. Level will change depending on the area you're in, just like in a CAMP probably.
---
Someone mentioned they go home if you enter an event, which I second as a great idea. It can get laggy enough at Encrypted with a full server attending. 
---
So the programming is there, as you mentioned for Beckett's final quest, the developers just need to find a good way to implement it after ironing out some of the issues still happening in game. And if there's a large enough interest for npc travel companions. And who knows if we get another CAMP ally with the BoS quest coming up? Or pets we don't have to tame and don't randomly get swallowed into the void after hours/days of searching.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of that

Don't press the button to open the gates for the Brahmin until you have found the four extra containers with loot in them. As stated by others YouTube is a good place for this one.
---
I definitely delete those after I turn the daily in. üòÇ
---
More like you summon him and once the ritual works he comes to you.
---
I know. I was just verifying that you can still get the good rewards without collecting the crates...
---
Link?
---
Gold grinding
---
Dang these screenshots are awesome! Mine are more random and a lot of close-ups on objects / signs
---
This. If you must have more tankiness for when stealth fails you and mobs start attacking you, see if you can get pieces with the 3\* effect of 15% damage reduction while runing or standing still (depending on what your strategy is when you come under fire). If you're running around in Secret Service armor, even one or two of these give you more survivability than a whole set of Bolstering.
---
Weirdly enough, I still use a Sledgehammer. Its got +Strength, Power Attack and Scorched damage, so it works really well against Scorched. Once went full madlad and used it on the Scorchbeast Queen for amusing headshot damage.
---
The Searing Heavy Sharp Rocket mod looks ugly as hell tho.
---
Fuckin primm amirite?
---
The best interior totally wasted.
---
Who wants to take bets they're going to start charging from the next season onwards?
---
2% chance is pretty shit tho is it safe to say you have a better shot if u get crates rather then none?
---
The. Entire. Game was fucking awesome.
---
Sounds like a glitched nuclear winter 50 cal
---
It‚Äôs definitely the more worthwhile grind between it and strangler heart. Poor thing was nerfed into the ground...

---
The problem with atoms has been raised so many times: the atom store content is extortionate relative to what you get and it's very rare that something comes up that makes people think, "yes, I need this".
---
The number of atoms you have is a testament to the relative low quality of most atom shop goods. So many people I play with also have over 10k saved up, in the rare chance something they actually want comes up for sale.
---
I myself try to spend mine when I can (and you're correct in assuming most of us have bought 0) and my poison is C.A.M.P items. Leading to a further frustration: for the few of us who buy everything we can using the free atoms, we still end up never being able to utilise it all.
---
Overall, the lacklustre content, high prices and not being able to utilise most of what we purchase are surely leading factors, and nerfing the number of free atoms (again) will not fix this.
---
I'm. Still. Looking forward to seeing new reno.
---
agreed, by is 8 more damage do the ugly, I yet need to roll one for me, and find plans to make my own, I have the mod unlocked already. I already have 1k scrip to try and roll something at lvl 50.
---
Hold on, so for starfield AND elder scrolls VI they will still be using the same old fuckin engine? What an absolute disappointment. That is practically killing all my hype. I loved the old games but hell that engine just cannot keep up with other modern titles these days.
---
Maybe after you complete the Ally quest line they could accompany you, I'd really like that. Would be nice to equip them with a weapon too.
---
If one thing is certain I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt do that. No way they‚Äôre in any position to charge people with how the games been
---
Or to be more accurate, Providence Equity Partners. Zenimax sold out to private equity and now we're paying the price
---
Lots of food provides useful benefits, and they all stack. For instance, there's 6 types of food that together give you a +70% melee damage bonus.
---
we should note how lackluster that atom shop offerings have been.  they expected/hoped they could lazy their way thru (as they percieve fork-knife's model to be)
---
I use a broken Chinese stealth armor and different non automatic BER fixers and handmades. And I love it! ‚úåüèª
---
I've seen him a bunch of times but it's so random. It's usually at night and when I'm in an area with a lot of trees. The first time was up north near one of the bunkers, the other time was near tower on your way to death claw island. 
---
Also, he appears with a group of cultists that are praying. I'm not sure if they have static spawn points but one was behind vault 76 and another was near the toxic lake bed. Also, the cliffs near the lucky home mine.
---
No, I understand that just fine, which is why I deliberately didn't comment on the rest of your post, but only pointed out that that particular piece was misleading.
---
That‚Äôs highly subjective
---
So bold! You've got your beaver on full display there :p
---
Yea I'd personally rather pay the monthly sub and have them update the in-game drops with a couple dozen new items a month, items that I have to find or trade for, than pay that sub for a meta currency that I spend buying a dozen items on the cash shop... or purchasing rank-ups.
---
This is a game after all, and a post-apoc one in which the theme and gameplay practices associated with it (i.e. scavenging) are important. It feels like Bethesda has forgotten that in their pursuit of the GaS model.
---
My requests...
---
See those guys with a deathclaw gauntlet or power fist? (And others but the are the common ones)
---
They're waiting for everyone to get their plinks in with their pea-shooters.
---
Once everyone has tagged the queen... Let her land! Let her land and let the bloodied melee guys go to work...  It's helpful if you can throw a cryo grenade or use a cryolator to keep her grounded... 
---
No need for anyone to waste a thousand rounds of ammo... Us bloodied melee guys are tryna get in, get our reward, and get back out as soon as possible.   We show up, beat the shit out of her in short order, and then everyone can get back to whatever else they're working on
---
I still laugh that they probably won't ever abandon Nuclear Winter even though it's been as much of a failure afterthought as every other PVP feature in 76.  Getting rid of 76 would be an indirect admission it sucks, so they choose to double down on it rather than go back to the drawing board yet again.
---
I cant believe I spelled renaissance wrong. Yikes. Lol
---
Yes, he sits and laughs at all our complaints
---
If you read the inside the vault properly they said they are not removing the atom rewards from daily and weekly challenges
---
It is really bad. Bethesda said that we'd get fewer atoms. They didn't say that we'd be slammed this hard.
---
Then again, you get stuff. Maybe not stuff that you want but stuff.
---
It's not about the atoms (and the helping ones coming from challenges until Bethesgreed appears). It's about the content in the Atom shop. DON'T. VAULT. THE. ITEMS. Let them stay in the store and put promos, offers, new content. BUT DON'T VAULT THE \*\*\*\*\*\*\* ITEMS. Let me choose when I want some stuff or not. Fucking mobile games strategy.
---
Found the griefer.
---
To be fair sometimes it‚Äôs not super clear
---
Add the Speed demon mutation. You‚Äôll sneak in the Chinese armor about as fast as you currently walk. Marsupial will also makes things even easier. Almost never being noticed when you‚Äôre point blank killing things in groups almost feels like cheating, but I‚Äôm enjoying every bit of it.
---
instigating is a must have for sneak attack builds. whether you get to roll one is a separate matter. i'm still trying to get an Instigating Hunting/Lever/Gauss rifle. all i have is a shotgun and bowie knife
---
I think the 50 songs include the classic radio station as well
---
its weird.  a battle royale for hoarders; every match i lose all my stuff?  no thanks!

Watch it mister, those bitches are the majority.
---
So far ive only got two pieces of ss armor one has the basic if mutated get 10 percent more defense and i started doing bloody stealth build, i wouldn't of tried bloodied if i didn't make a gauntlet with that effect. Anyway back to what I was saying even with two pieces of the ss armor and one of them I got lucky got unyielding on it but the two pieces of ss armor do help me survive better than when I just had the chest piece and take more damage so I can attack. Lol because I'm mostly stealth bloodied melee so if i get noticed sneaking I gotta be able to take some damage so I can basically one hit the creature when I get close enough
---
It's not that common but common enough that people are reporting on it multiple times a day.
---
I hope you got their names. Just report them and move on. Sadly, other than posting here to try and push Bethesda to do something about it, there's not much else you can do.
---
It all depends on how much you like the new items they‚Äôre rewarding. If you do, then fewer atoms doesn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôd likely have bought those things anyway. If you don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs bad. 
---
Personally, in a year and a half I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actively pursued Atom challenges‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone. So the change will likely give me more than before because you rank up from XP and events too.
---
Saw it in a random youtub vid once. Cannot find it now. it was a building tips vid. I'll try and it explain it the best i can. One sec.
---
They've said you can still get atoms through the other challenges aka kill blah blah robots with blah blah stuff like that
---
It is not, but they did state that there are still going to be daily and weekly challenges that reward atoms.
---
I can do it like every 10 mins, it's how I farm for scrip and 5mm ammo, not a random event, has to be triggered by a player
---
The problem isn't the free atoms. The problem is the Atom shop and the fucking rotation of items, the vaulting, the shit offers, the non-existant discount when you already have something from the pack, etc. I have 12500 free atoms but I would buy atoms if needed if the store was... A game store, not a mobile game store.
---
Just get rid of the cap.
---
CBBE would be as approved as EVB, but so far you'd have to put in some work to do it. There's a walkthrough vid, but I think it may have some errors, as my last attempts failed on textures. Textures are different for 76, as the prior games use difference, normals, specular, and SK. 76 adds another layer, L, which I'm not familiar with. If you have BAE, you can open up EVB if you've downloaded it, and take a look at how their textures are set up to get a better picture, then compare it to fo4's cbbe textures. Takes some work, but those who've successfully imported it in haven't reported an issue. EVB is safe and it's client side only.
---
yea, to a certain degree this is unavoidable. It's good to have some high level friends to call on. Also, I found it helps to think of it as just a really hard part of the game? Sucks, I know.
---
I might have seen it on a no respawn video
---
That's definitely another issue. My personal take on that is that the performance issue is a serious consideration, but also, they've openly said a few times that they're working on camp budget solutions (plus they have the interior instanced camps on the roadmap, so we know at least one potential solution is on the way).
---
One of my big issues with Bethesda concerning the in-game rewards is that they're not doing, openly discussing, or forecasting anything that will fix this particular issue. It seems like they don't want to interface with it at all and the only reason I can think of is because this game is a GaS and in the end adding items to the in-game experience could distract from their cash shop and purchasable ranks. And I find that rather disgusting.
---
It may not be true, mind you-- I'm just a possibility based on what I'm seeing from Bethesda. If this game goes another 1.5 years with no in-game updates, then Fallout 76 is dead to me and I would consider Bethesda a greedy, disrespectful company that used a great IP for a very shitty reason. 
---
Time will tell on that count though. I'm still open to seeing change.
---
Things you can do: Don‚Äôt fight back. 
---
Things you can do if they start throwing explosive bait: Leave the server and join a new one.
---
You shall not pass!
---
Go pacifist - I've never had problems, I always run pacifist mode.

My melee alt is close to 19'000 caps, so I'm contemplating the Speed Demon recipe, yeah. I've heard you'll have to assign soup to hotkey because you start breathing food and water, but gotta go fast.
---
Give everyone  in BLM some atoms so they don't murder us, I mean wtf.
---
I mean it is Bethesda! Yeah I remember seeing that.
---
Nice! I‚Äôm actually from Morgantown WV myself. This was awesome to look at.
---
Just buy the code on Amazon and send it to the recipient, no need to build it into the game.  
---
Honestly they have no incentive to allow a player that just earns free atoms to send those to another player.
---
If you're going to post things just for free karma you probably want to make sure it's factual first.
---
There should be a sticky in this sub where everyone can post their favorite screenshot. One per user and you can edit your post if you take a better one.

Only run melee with you‚Äôre heavy gun toon. Works well and you can have a good build for both, with minimal switching of perk cards
---
If it isn‚Äôt yours it‚Äôs stealing.
---
I usually have pacifist mode on so even if I do shoot them by accident or something, I won't initialize pvp which that way they can't destroy my base. But if you are on pc i can help with fixing everything

Maybe someone claimed it and left the server so the extractor remains locked until you claim that workshop

Yea I managed to block them from session and filed a report but my ps4 wasn't recording at the time so I don't really have anything to show and send them so I doubt anything will be done and it's a shame cause that was the first base I made myself and I was pretty happy with it.
---
Lol your getting downvoted like your wrong. The entire nw pool is two games consisting of 25-35 people. When events happen we get two full games. Last night we had so few we got reduced map size. Then you have a new hack out and people using it. Also the afk farmers always at least 2-5 which everyone notices. You can report video or tickets but the only thing you‚Äôll get is an auto response to block them and join another game. Huge joke.
---
Could just turn your camp into a arena and offer rewards based on completion post information about player held events between here and facebook have the combatants initiate a dual before entering the arena 2 doors on each side and pry some cover
---
The point is to show that I myself have a very limited amount of play time, and if I can accomplish getting to level 100 without paying for it, then yes anyone else can too. Time management is all about what you're actually willing to give your time to. Its the same logic as pulling an all nighter for an important exam, or deciding to sleep in for an extra hour. We all control how much time we spend on different things during our day. Work being an obvious exception. If players have a very limited amount of free time and choose still not to use it on FO, then that's their decision. That particular player is deciding that the grind to level 100 isn't that important to them. And that's fine, but we literally all share the same 24 hour days. Do some work more than others, of course. Are there people who have restrictions outside of work in their free time, of course. But those two categories are probably not filled with gamers to begin with. 
---
Bottom line is if someone really wants to play, they will find the time to.
---
I can confirm this worked for me twice when every other day  and time It wouldent work

I‚Äôm carrying full starched and class freak, but honestly, the food and water drain was no big deal at base value. Thought it would be much worse. I play stealth sneak shotgun so also have Eagle Eyes, Grounded, Bird Bones, and the Electrified one. Melee has a couple good mutations. But speed demon, that‚Äôs a ridiculous addition to the invisibility and sneaking.
---
Yet they all still count as games with significant loops and no sub. xD
---
This is what I figured, I'd give an answer and you'd sidestep the original point. 
---
Anyway, it's yesterday's conversation and I'm gonna move on, if you still enjoy 76 then that's great. It's not a bad game at all, it's just wasting potential and becoming less like a Fallout game in terms of gameplay IMO.
---
Yea sadly the whole time it happened my buddy was gone so it was me vs 3 people and it seemed all they cared about doing was destroying my camp and not killing me so I had to end up leaving to stop them from fully leveling the whole place.
---
I do the same, but have Spotify open on my phone as well. then I can easily skip or pause the music playing on my Playstation from my phone.
---
What? Violent mobs in the streets trying to destroy the Republic and all you care about is some shitty RPG character, fuck you, you are a clown.
---
Why not just grab the serum vs buying the recipe? Can find cheap one at camps or worst case under 4K at the bunker.
---
You have to claim the workshop before you can start unlocking stuff even though the previous owner has left the server. Happened to me before and I received a bounty. Probably not how the developers intended it to work, but that‚Äôs how it currently works.
---
The workshop may have been unowned when you picked the lock, but you became wanted since another player placed that lock on the machine, and subsequently logged off. The game still recognizes that machine as belonging to someone. 
---
Curiously, if you own a workshop and you get booted from the server, you can relog (assuming you can join a player on that same server), and the workshop will still belong to you, if it hasn‚Äôt been claimed in the interim. 
---
You could have circumvented this bounty by claiming the workshop, which would shift ownership of the locked machines to you.
---
But it tends to fuck up her aggro, especially if you get it (as a bloodied heavy with a B gauss mini I often get it). From never landing to just flying away. Best is if everyone is on the ground for as little bugs as possible
---
That but also Fallout 1st subscriptions.  I‚Äôm currently sitting on over 11k Atoms because nothing in the Atomic Shop has caught my eyes in a while.  I think my last expensive purchase was the Log Cabin bundle when that first came out.  There are some things in the files I want though.
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure if Daily and Weekly Challenges will still reward Atoms or just Season XP though.  Assuming challenges no longer reward Atoms, it is a very significant loss on free Atoms.  Each season is 10 Weeks and you can earn 1500 Atoms each season.  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on that.  Currently, on average, you can earn 350 Atoms from Daily Challenges.  Over a course of 10 weeks, that would be 3500 Atoms just on Daily Challenges alone.   Add whatever the average is for Weekly Challenges and it‚Äôs an even bigger loss.
---
Yea I realize my fighting back was a huge error on my part cause they ignored me just to destroy the base. I will know for next time if this ever happens again.
---
&gt;Q: If Daily and Weekly Challenges no longer award Atoms, will I still earn the same amount in the new system?
---
&gt;A:  There are fewer Atoms overall up for grabs in this new system, but you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges.
---
i can help you in an hr! psn: mowitz
---
Your an idiot and are overly anal
---
Gee thanks. Only picked the lock and left the 3 steaks after seeing they clearly still belonged to someone just wondering how this system works
---
What's that and how do I do that?
---
What are you talking about?
---
If you move your camp it will blueprint everything you had built and after you move you can put the blueprint down without having to repair anything. So if you place your camp exactly where you had it you can just put everything where it was before. Just costs the amount of caps it takes to move your camp to repair everything. Sometimes it's hard to put the stuff back down the way you had it before is all but a lot easier than collecting junk to repair.
---
Don‚Äôt ever engage back. This games pvp mechanics have always been broken. People kno this and will use the game mechanics to grief you.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt be able to destroy your camp unless you‚Äôve engaged them back. ( at least not with out an exploit) 
---
There are ways too double your unyielding stats, enter god mod, spam and rubber band your health bar. It‚Äôs just not worth it right now. Every fifth pvp encounter I‚Äôve had in FO76 has been....hacky. 
---
Not too mention people who have duped bobbles, mags and chems.
---
I do.  I don't sprint since I need to maintain cover, but I try to keep underneath her.
---
I worked in DC the time FO3 was out and it was a treat comparing the game locations to the real thing.
---
Same

---
That‚Äôs how it is. There are multiple ways to earn s.c.o.r.e.  NW is just one of them.
---
Gosh, I stole like 100000 steel alone!
---
What's pacifist mode? I'm on ps4 but thanks.
---
Since Wastelanders release
---
So if you claim it first it unlocks? How does leaving the server and then returning even work with claimed workshops
---
If u have room in your stash this might be a good idea
---
No, most have been fixed by now, the contemporary curtains can, and there was one cactus I could put at a friend's camp a few weeks ago
---
Am I the only one who experiences a disproportionately high chance of sentinel and powered on the secret service armour?
---
One, or both, of those effects seems to roll more than half the time for me. However, in over 50 rolls for a right leg, not a single one was unyielding, two were vanguard, one was bolstering and almost half were nocturnal.
---
Thank you! I'll add you
---
I know it was going to be exactly like this. They told they were going to remove challenges. It was so obvious we were going to have a supernerf in atom earning.
---
troubleshooters gear if you can find some 
---
use chems and food buffs 
---
aim for the limbs.. if you can manage to cripple it you should be able to avoid getting melted while you chip away at it..
---
What's crazy is the game will use the junk in your stash before using the already scrapped junk in your scrap-box!! WHY? There's stuff I want to hang on to but can't build another display case and I don't want to fill up my vending machine with 30k junk for safe keeping.
---
thats what battle royale is, if you die, you loose all your loot \[you dont get to keep any of it even if you win\] battle royales have loot all over the place thats why no one cares if they die and loose their guns they got from just a minute of playing
---
Yes, this right here!
---
Interesting I didn't know this was a thing, thanks. What about items placed by friends will those also stay too?
---
haha, my general gripe for BR's.  u loot to fight in the match, but then it all goes away.  i just want to collect teddy bears, but ill be damned if i have to give away/lose this 40-lb gatling gun (that i have no ammo for).
---
part of the reason why i prefer battlefield/cod/overwatch/battlefront for pvp; ur kit is ur kit and u wont lose it
---
If I really wanted an adventure reward in a br game mode,  I would grind it out... it's not really a big deal
---
I have a main that I play and then I have 2 alts that I leveled to test builds on.  I leveled both of them on double/triple XP weekends.  Outside of that you are 157% correct.  Once you get to around 15 it just starts to suck really bad.
---
Thanks! This explains everything I wanted to know, interesting mechanic
---
How would you know how well the atomic store is doing? Does Bethesda release that kind of information?
---
yup, has been said on this subreddit and various other platforms multiple times.

Blue Heeler reminded me of the dog companion Boomer from Far Cry 5. I love Dogmeat but Boomer was the greatest and most useful dog companion ever.
---
Desemos we have proof you hack in NW. aimbot, godmode, flying hack, wallhack. Arent you ashamed to help people here like you are legit and win every game in NW by hacking ?? people know it. we have video prooving it if you try your way out...
---
Jeez makes you reconsider shooting her in the air.
---
So im confused now  the FAQ says its not giving atoms for daily weekly challenges but lifetime challenges still give atoms.
---
Can you link where it says dailys and weekly still give atoms please i would like to read it.
---
I enjoy some of his fallout videos and he seems cool, is there something I don't know?
---
So much butthurt about nw
---
I think it's all rng. I have 2 characters the other one rolled a full set of unyielding with weapon weight reduction which is pretty decent lol.
---
I've had it happen that I look on the map and see Hemlock Holes Maintenance is unclaimed.  
---
I fast travel and notice that there are a bunch of existing items such as extractors.  I take a look at the map again and Hemlock Holes Maintenance shows as a claimed workshop.  
---
Maybe this happened to you, too?
---
Its somewhere in your settings (maybe in gameplay?) Look for Pacifist Mode in your settings and turn it on. Nobody can damage you and you can't damage others.
---
Playing a bloodied character is very much like playing a wizard in D&amp;D - you can dish out a lot, but you can't take a lot. Granted, some bloodied builds can get deceptively tanky, especially if serendipity luck is on fire, but that's a matter of personal taste. I forego most of the perk cards that can help a bloodied build tank like Ironclad and barbarian (at least during the queen fight - outside that fight I run barbarian, blocker and iron fist on the strength tree).
---
Yea I don't like pvp. Wish I could turn it off to be honest.
---
Maybe it is as intended as a way to get more people claiming workshops, seems odd though. Ah well live and learn I guess
---
It should take much longer than full month to get a full set of ‚Äògood‚Äô UNY, if it takes 140 tries to get the right left leg lol
---
I run 3 accounts on my laptop and the one I'm actively playing at that moment on my pc. I can run all 4 on my pc, but I like to be able to actively keep an eye on the other 3 by easily hitting the windows key to monitor their caps.
---
So, basically, I run a full group with myself. Each account I run has at least one character with a 15 charisma to share any max perks (like Adrenaline, Gunsmith, Bodyguards, or whatever). Also, all characters run Empath (Angry Turtle has a good video out now showing how OP it is), and Herd Mentality for +3 to all SPECIAL.
---
All 4 characters have a full vendor. I empty the caps multiple times a day generally. I usually spend about 45k a day or two to hop around on my mule to buy up all of the cheap legendaries  to be used as scrip each day on 20 characters. 16 of the characters have the Fixer plan learned for better chances at good Fixers at the purveyor.
---
As for events, it depends on what I'm doing, but there are a couple of events I stay on the lookout for. Uranium Fever is a guaranteed 12 legendaries and is very easy to prep for. I just park the 3 characters that are normally sleeping in a bed locked in a room sharing perks somewhere in the middle of the event so that they can get loot (but not exp, unfortunately). I make sure to kill the legendary enemies closer to ensure everyone can loot them.
---
I also do this with any high level horde event that has melee-only enemies (Yao guai, ghouls, etc). I park the 3 sleeper characters on a roof and kill everything *except* the main event legendary so it'll constantly spawn other enemies (including legendaries). Usually I'll cripple the main enemy so it just crawls around helpless. I can usually get about 40 legendaries an hour doing this. 
---
I do these two events on a private server only pretty much. That way there's no issues with other players messing it up.
---
Usually, though, I'm just trying to make sure I have access to the perfect perk setup and Empath for my main character, while selling through 4 vendors.
---
There are some daily maintenance issues that take me about an hour every day to do, unfortunately. For example, as I mentioned, I need to turn in 150 scrip a day with 20 characters. I also have the bugged Misc item (Osmosis Kit or Portable Power Pack) for the bugged instant Foundation daily turn in. This way I'm getting a little exp, foundation rep, a few caps, and 3 notes on everyone each day, even if I'm not actively playing them.
---
I still have several characters that I haven't finished the Wastelanders storyline with, so they're not able to get gold yet. I'm working on doing this with everyone now. It's a bit boring, though, so I've been slacking. I try to make sure I'm buying my 300 gold every week with everyone else, though.
---
Anyway, it probably sounds really tedious and unnecessary. Realistically, you'd be mostly right. I have a good system, though, and I've streamlined it to the point where it's not so bad for me. I enjoy it, and I suppose at the end of the day that's what's most important.
---
Right. Hopefully you can follow this. 
---
Place a dirt tile. Place a corn in the corner. 
---
Then place another corn as close as you can get it. Which isn't very close. 
---
Now blueprint those 2 corn. Delete the 2nd corn you placed. 
---
Now get your 2 corn blueprint and you'll find then you can place 1 of the corns a lot closer than before. Place it. Delete 2nd corn. 
---
Blueprint those 2 close together corns. Use the 2 close together corn blueprint to now have 4 close together corns. Then use the 2 ctcb again and you now have a row of 6. Blueprint those 6. Stick em down. BOOOWM!
---
18 corn on a tile rather than like 5

I've bought stuff in the atom store and have fallout 1st now.   
---
I think free atoms are critical for keeping people interested in the atom store, if it werent for them I might never have opened the thing up and seen that there are things I wanted.
---
If you leave the server you will stop owning that workshop but any extractor you builded in and added a lock will remain locked until somebody else claims it, yo know what I mean?
---
Several Cucks On Reddit, Enraged
---
In game, go to settings &amp; you can put "Pacifist" on, which prevents people (mostly) from forcing you into PvP.
---
You can just go into your game menu and turn on passive mode. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
That's good then, I've no interest in NW myself unless I had people to play with but it's good to have options.
---
So much butthurt about a non-issue in this entire thread.
---
it is clear.. there are no more daily/weekly atoms
---
&gt; Q: IF DAILY AND WEEKLY CHALLENGES NO LONGER AWARD ATOMS, WILL I STILL EARN THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE NEW SYSTEM?
---
&gt; you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges.
---
daily and weekly will be gone
---
What's funny is that they probably set a lot of the original prices relative to the amount of atoms that could be earned for free in game. Now that they are reducing the amount of free atoms up for grabs, do you think they'll lower the shop prices?
---
I‚Äôm in this same boat. I‚Äôve never gone after daily or weekly stuff before. Just the character or lifetime ones or whatever the scout badges are under.
---
Hmm interesting, though the workshop bench said it was unclaimed in this instance it didn't mean something similar didn't happen
---
&gt; If you read the inside the vault properly 
---
you might want to go back and look at it again...
---
I answered in another question in this thread above.
---
I feel you. Sadly.
---
I'll do that the next time I'm on. Thanks for the advice
---
Awesome I'll have to turn that on when I get on later. Thanks
---
Hey Mods, can we have an official r/fo76 drinking game where we take a shot every time somebody breaks rule 9?
---
Yep, got it, thanks
---
some people have a hard time with reading comprehension it seems.. thx for the quote
---
Might as well just post the proof now since people are gonna ask for it.
---
Well I'll be doing that when I get on later then. ^_^
---
Then how about proof be posted?
---
This is like one of those 4chan "if anon rolls trips will deliver" bullshit threads where OP never delivers.
---
But I'm willing to provide a full written apology if I'm proven wrong.
---
just admit u suck n00b
---
My enthusiasm for the game was totally lost not long after the release of wastelanders.
---
I'm not sure why that is, (too much grind? Just more of the same?) but nothing on the roadmap makes me want to return.
---
A new region to explore, less things to grind for, more end game content would probably grab me. Seasons to me however just feels like overhyped daily challenges.
---
&gt;If you read the inside the vault properly 
---
It's funny seeing someone call someone else out for doing exactly what they did ü§£
---
&gt; I absolutely hate the fact that they hide adventure mode rewards in NW to try and force people who have no interest in it to play it
---
Yeah having the lore of the vault locked behind it *sucks*.
---
please understand what is going on here. i will provide proof quickly
---
I haven‚Äôt heard of this before, but a similar circumstance can be generated when a player powers up a vending machine and fails to designate any items as *marked for sale*.
---
Basically, you could just have run into a few empty machines. One way to find out if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened is to check the vendor card when you hover over the camp icon on the map. A powered-up yet empty vending machine will show no inventory on the vendor card. 
---
If the vendor card shows that a quantity items are for sale, and you still can‚Äôt see them when you interact with the machine at the camp, then there‚Äôs a larger issue at play, and you may want to run the gamut of troubleshooting strategies (i.e.: relog; restart your console; uninstall/reinstall; file a support ticket with BGS). 
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs the (unlikely) case of a few coincidentally empty machines. Good luck.
---
what a wonderful service for the community. thank you so much.
---
Yeah I think that's gonna be the case. Going to make a new character with full points in strength for heavy gun/melee/shotgun cards. Thanks.
---
It's all good dude, see you in the wastes!
---
im uploading to youtube. just give a couple minutes.
---
Well yeah, of course there are plenty of people who have longer shifts or important tasks during free time. But it all boils down to what you're willing to spend your time on. Do I clean the house or get in a couple of hours of FO? My son just fell asleep and my wife is napping, time for some FO. I decode to sleep 6-7 hours instead of 8-10 just to get some extra FO time in. 
---
People who work 10-12 hour shifts probably don't play any video games. They're either the type of worker who has to do that 5 days a week or more, in which case they're probably exhausted most of the time. Or they're in the medical field and they only have those long shifts 3-4 days a week. That's keaves a few days of being off, in which you can probably find some time to play. 
---
I guess it depends on how you define a casual gamer. To me it's a gamer who gets to play a few hours a day, with some exceptions of either getting more time playing in a day than usual or no time to play at all thay day. If someone is playing less than that, then they're not casual, they're basically non existent.
---
2nd image (sunset behind tree) is real nice
---
Yea I got several UNY chest pieces already (haven‚Äôt started rolling limbs yet) without huge amount of tries, my hp is always between 20-30 so I personally didn‚Äôt feel like RNG is trying to twist my arms.
---
i dont suck i win a lot when desemos is not there lol.
---
Is it another bug? I thought it was the best out of all of them?
---
I can confirm this my quad 33 VATs one shots 90%of enemies
---
Ahhhhh gotcha gotcha
---
Haha, I have totally seen you on the map before.  I'll be online in an hour or so, I'll look for you.
---
Well how else are the developers supposed to continually pump out free content?  If most players can buy things from the Atomic Shop using free Atoms, there is no money being funded to support future content.  I do  think that Atomic Shop prices should be adjusted with this change though.  I really don‚Äôt want to pay more money on top of my Fallout 1st subscription.  If I choose to buy a bundle that‚Äôs almost all my Atoms for that month.
---
Wow. What the hell are they thinking? Definitely will not be purchasing either of these on release. I have a feeling neither of them will be performing even remotely well.
---
Happy to help. See you in the wasteland.
---
I've seen it for 500 caps, and I probably should have gotten a few to try, but I'm partial to making it myself so I can also sell it later.
---
Played both games too and feel the same. They are unable to make me want to grind after I played the whole season scenarios.
---
I do single player game breaks when I'm bored about MMOs, they barely took a week to finish.
---
I'm running to stand still.
---
It's this a violation of Rule 9?
---
Please understand that this subreddit has rules that can be easily viewed and that your post directly breaks Rule 9, and that anything that has to do with somebody hacking in Adventure or NW should be taken directly to Bethesda on their own forums, not here.
---
It might not let you place those. Can't remember. ü§û
---
Perhaps the owner had just left the game and the workshop ownership and locked existing extractors had not yet synced in the game.
---
If you go to your challenges and go down to world there are specific challenges for possum badges as well.
---
I hope you're a kid with an attitude like that, if only because it means you have a chance to grow up. xD
---
Fallout 1st was supposed to be the way they made money. And plenty of people still buy atoms. Just read the comments from People talking about never doing the challenges anyway. They could at least refresh the account wide atom challenges or add to them as new content is released.
---
That's great!  Thanks!
---
Just remember that they made the choice to invest their time and resourses into a game mode that nobody wanted instead of fixing their broken product. Also the Beth's version of BR is massively flawed when compaired to the buissness model of other games. They just now are implementing a battlepass something that needs to be there to give people a reason to play BR repeatedly as it is very repetitive. Access to BR is also behind a 60$ paywall, something fans of the BR genere do not like. They should release a free-to-play version of the NW mode and try to get people to buy the full game; usually F2P BR games do not have much substance to their full game, something beth could very well take advantage of. Also their development team is too small to be able to manage BR and survival, and then there is the issues of hackers, cheaters, weapon balance, player balance (perks), netcode, server maintenance and people who are tired of the bugs and looking for a way to just have fun.
---
Beth followed an industry trend and it had not worked out for them.
---
we have reported him at leat 50 times to bthesda but you know as usual it wont change anything. The problem here is that the user is very active on the sub and helping people out like he is full legit

Go to the reddit fallout marketplace page and just post a request for whichever serum for caps and I would imagine you‚Äôll have several offers of much lower than 500
---
What kind of build do you have going now?
---
Okie dokie.  I really don't care as I really don't know anyone on here by their handle except a few friends.  Don't know who this guy is.
---
Denial most likely.
---
People have spent over a year complaining about the prices, the lack of good quality content and the various limits imposed on what you buy anyway. (camp items)
---
The huge reduction in free atoms compounds the cost issue and makes the store LESS appealing, which they haven't grasped.
---
You say that yet on Xbox at least there are still plenty of people playing. I'm always in full matches with fresh faces each time I play it. It released with pretty positive reviews. This is the first I've heard about the masses laughing at it's failures.
---
The problem is this though:
---
Of the people who are playing, how many are closer to the $7 a week vs. $2 a week? 
---
And of people in both camps, is the company making enough money to maintain that payout?
---
And that‚Äôs the real issue.  People who are playing every day, are earning enough atoms that they don‚Äôt need to spend money.  People who are only playing on weekends may not be playing every day, but may also decide to simply not purchase atoms simply because they aren‚Äôt playing enough to benefit from it (and people who play only on weekends likely have a lot more of the lifetime achievements they can still earn)
---
Bethesda as a company probably has a ton of cash, but whats important is if THIS game is making money.  Look at Microsoft, they aren‚Äôt hurting for cash yet they just closed mixer and their retail stores.  Why? Because it was losing money.  
---
Now if this game is making money or not, I don‚Äôt have an answer - I‚Äôd have to try to find one of the earnings reports if that‚Äôs even out there (where they usually talk about the success of different ventures) - but the real point is, regardless of how much you are playing, if money isn‚Äôt coming in from people of all play styles, then they need to make changes.
---
delete the game and go back to fortnite!
---
Who says its normal to play multiple videos games in the same day? I'd argue that its abnormal, I'm not a game hopper. I don't get so tired of a game after an hour that I need a new game to be tired of in the next 2 hours. Thats weird, probably expensive, and sounds like the logic of a child with adhd. 
---
And if you're playing multiple games, it completely voids any complaint you might have about not having enough time to gain levels in the season. You're actively choosing to spend your free time on a different game.
---
My punk boi raider is good company.
---
Okay, and? There‚Äôs still rules here. What you‚Äôre doing is like telling a cop it‚Äôs perfectly fine that you ran a red light because you‚Äôre trying to call someone out for stealing a TV from BestBuy. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
So... you make a thread that is likely to be deleted and resulting in you getting a suspension or even a ban, *before* you have your evidence ready?

Nuclear winter is extremely popular on my platform and matches can be found instantly.  
---
I agree that NW should be released as F2P.  But this is your reminder that NW is technically still in Beta according to them so maybe we will see this sometime next year when it leaves beta.
---
It doesn't say anywhere in the ITV about keeping daily/weekly atom rewards. This is the section that deals with it:
---
&gt;By completing Daily and Weekly Challenges, you‚Äôll earn S.C.O.R.E. which will allow you to rank up and claim a new reward every time you do! To help you rank-up, we‚Äôve revamped our Daily and Weekly Challenges to provide easier everyday content for players. You‚Äôll get rewarded just for doing things you already do as you play Fallout 76! Maybe one of your Daily Challenges will be scrapping junk to get a certain resource, or crafting ammo at a workbench. Or maybe it‚Äôll even be a more social Challenge like using photomode while you‚Äôre partied up. We haven‚Äôt changed any of the Lifetime Challenges and they will not be updated with each Season, so you will still be able to complete them and earn their one-time Atom rewards.
---
well, I cant perdict when someone launches a nuke, can I?

Oh, look at that there, removed.

Also OP, I‚Äôm finding it somewhat strange that you‚Äôre a brand new Reddit account but are trying to bring trouble to somebody that‚Äôs been here for 6 years. That‚Äôs all though, just find that strange.
---
there is worse than being banned on a sub reddit dude lol. get over it and have a nice day
---
What‚Äôs your yt channel I wanna see the vid
---
Yuuuup
---
At least you fucking try. Too many losers on here who have the PvP skills of a rock but want PvP rewards.
---
omg you proove your point dude! im sorry i offended you and ruined your day
---
Now they‚Äôve made this premium currency a way to pay to win, yes I will whinge and bitch about it. Before I was able to earn the Nuka Cola bundle I wanted, but now, if it came up again I can‚Äôt do that. What if there was a PA skin I actually wanted but I also wanted a gun skin? I have no hope whatsoever of getting both. None. Nada. Not unless I buy atoms, which I‚Äôm actually better off investing in the rank system to get ‚Äúin game currency‚Äù and ‚ÄúVault-Tec supply packages which give my scrap collection a boost‚Äù or lunchboxes which give a *significant* buff to XP earned. Tell me this isn‚Äôt P2W, because there‚Äôs no way a guy working a normal job has the time to grind a hundred ranks.
---
1. A regular PvE event that happens in the arena on it's own every now and then
---
2. A triggerable PvP event that happens when more than one "waiting rooms" are filled with players.
---
Plz do.
---
I guess you could say fallout76 is gender fluid
---
All of them being marginally different in practice seems to be by design. 
---
My reference is a youtube video where he gets hit by the same enemy 3 times in each power armor and notes down how much damage he took. The stats on the wiki say the T65 is much better but as i said it seems to be little difference in practice. There's probably a cap where there is deminishing returns. https://youtu.be/IPu8f4DMo3M?t=427
---
Yeah i like that guy, seems like a nice person just trying to preserve knowledge.
---
Have you reported them on [Bethesda support](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
gratz.  
---
im just protecting myself with this account haha. you have logic ?
---
So much damage...
---
Mate, I read it perfectly fine. Why don't you go read it again?
---
Does anyone know what the stats are by chance
---
I‚Äôm at that point of making and selling, so I totally see that side of things. but I also know how much faster I‚Äôve been pulling in caps, loot and exp since I went ahead and just went full mutation.
---
But how does a girl become a guy I don‚Äôt understand??? Does anyone else I sure don‚Äôt
---
of course
---
Yup. But you forgot one of the most important aspects of fighting the Queen... buffs. The right buff combo make you take her down twice as fast.
---
That has happened to me a lot. If you exit the machine and go back, it might fix it. I know I've missed out on a lot of items because I just assumed that machine was empty.
---
Dude I quoted exactly what it says, which is in direct contradiction to what you say. Why don't you provide some sort of source yourself which proves your point? Otherwise, the evidence shows you were not comprehending it correctly.
---
While yes we are getting fewer atoms from daily/weekly combined, we are getting a ton of free cosmetics (around 40), and consumables.  I also don't mind it this way as I HATE getting on a game to grind "Go Out Of Your Way" Challenges.
---
While Yes there will be daily/weekly challenges still (giving score instead of atoms), they are suppose to be much easier and most unlocked just by normal play; as well as, just gaining exp and leveling will give score.
---
Plus they are practically giving us the ammo converter (level 5), which is awesome.
---
Imagine, they could have done what almost every other season pass game does, 1 free item then the next 5-10 are locked behind a pay wall (phantasy star online 2 anyone?), while still removing the daily/weekly atoms.
---
Plus come on, we are ***FINALLY Getting Lunchboxes!***  *I just want to make them into landmines though....*
---
It's not a secret that PvP is largely unpopular in 76.  The audience for it is a very small minority and you can safely assume that even without needing to know exact numbers.  
---
The plain and simple reality is the majority don't really have an interest in playing it and the few that stomach it might only be doing so for the unique CAMP rewards and after that, never touch it again.  
---
The rest are actual PvP aficionados who are a constantly-shrinking crowd due to Bethesda realizing how little interest 76 players have in PvP and are cutting back a lot of the remaining PvP artifacts within  the game, such as Survival mode a while back.
---
Nope not a kid just a world weary grown man tired of people's entitled opinions
---
You posted similarly comaining about the atom store only three days ago, calm down
---
They should have given the scrap box to everyone specifically because it's a no brainer. It's not hard to think of a new perk for fo1 that would be appreciated, if it's taxing to store weapons then give 1st members a box that holds 20 guns or armor without increasing stash weight, or a bank system.
---
At the end of the day they identified a pain point in the game and exploited it for cash. It's a business decision but as a fo1
---
This is an old bug.  It was fixed, then brought back for Wastelanders.  Yay!
---
"DB Tech" graduate here.  Bethesda even had FO4's school announcements heard in the game spot on.  Thanks for the letterman jacket in '76, a permanent skin for me!
---
Boo hoo Bethesda's poor management of content free and charged, and their exorbitant costs of Atom store items ($14/18 per skin) say compared to creation club and what you got for your money in F04... and the F76 chore grinds aren't working and will destroy the game we really want to succeed..
---
That's not on us to throw more money at dude! No matter how many in game hours we have clocked up.. That's on Bethesda to throw more money at. They are a multimillion dollar company (probably billions just from fallout shelter alone) Its their responsibility not the consumers. Especially why F76 is in the bargain bin already.. It's not our fault that Bethesda did every single thing on F76 underdeveloped understaffed underplanned undercooked and under the table apart from maybe the world space itself. Just like how they broke the in game economy of caps etc almost instantly with duping etc and it went black market and out of their control.. They have pushed in monetisation every opportunity they can instead of stepping up and making a better product that people actually want to spend on eg Elder long coat, Mechanist, Slasher atoms bundles, settler/raider wastelanders bundles.. Compare it to Creation Club and FO4 DLC.. F76 Atom products are hot trash and alot of the time completely immersion breaking.. Its a pokemon gambling addiction business model but they can't even raise the camp budget to fit it all eg.. Bethesda need to reap what they have sown and reach into their own pockets to boost this product considering in some countries like Australia, their government has deemed the product "A total failure" and forced refunds... 
---
Here's a euphemism for you.. If you bought a new AAA car where the engine had issues off the start (A lemon). Then you bought a subscription to get roadside services and it kept having issues but at least you had free help to keep it running and hopefully fix it.. What do you think most people would do if your free roadside service was cancelled and you had to pay every time for something that should just be from the start and it was never fixed? Trade it in for a better car dude. Only an idiot would throw more money into it than the car cost originally.
---
You are done with the game. There are little things you can try to get but there is no point as there is no more game to use them in. Normally you would busy yourself making the world awesome or get into some cool pvp but this game doesn't have non-broken versions of those features. I tried for the last month or so to make more out of it, but it is joyless and uncreative from here on out.
---
My first run in was the other day too. Killed a wanted player (still need 7 more for the challenge!) And not 2 minutes after a nuke is launched on my camp.
---
No big deal, I logged off to switch server. My mistake was reloading too soon, got put back in the same server, camp destroyed. The team that did it came to visit and were emoting and teabagging etc as if it was a big deal. Literally no effect to me, I just repaired all on a new server as I had plenty of all the mats.
---
If you're on PS4 and know what you need I can hopefully help out.
---
That or they could adjust Atomic Shop prices accordingly.  If someone wants to buy a single bundle in the Atomic Shop for 1500 Atoms, they have to either spend most of their Fallout 1st Atoms for that month, buy a $20 Atom bundle, or wait 10 weeks to save up assuming they unlock all the Atoms for the season.  I personally don‚Äôt want to pay more money on top of my Fallout 1st subscription.
---
So a que for Nuclear Winter from within Adventure Mode is all you need. That's how most MMOs do it. There are definitely countless rewards in those games you can only get from pvp that you still use in pve. Usually it's a currency.
---
Nice! One of mine is a Vampire / Limb Damage. It's like you're invincible!
---
My day hasn‚Äôt been ruined. I actually like seeing people trying to defend their reasons for breaking a rule that requires zero effort to follow.
---
Make sure you have "Pacifist Mode" enabled (from the settings menu - game options)
---
With Pacifist enabled I don't think they can push your character either, so AFK becomes less of a worry. They could still kite in baddies from another area though, so if you AFK make sure to be elevated enough to not get molerat-ed to death...
---
I wonder what demographic buys cosmetics in a big way in games like Dota and League? Maybe your game has to appeal to Asian markets to make a cosmetics model work. I also  agree giving away a big amount of free Atoms in game makes buying them seem pointless.
---
People no longer playing is a huge part of the problem. There are more people playing fallout 4 right now than 76. Activity is dropping off very fast.
---
Just want people‚Äôs opinions on why or why not I‚Äôm not tryna make a fight
---
I'll make it easy on you, here's the facts from BGS:
---
From the Seasons FAQ page:
---
From the inside the vault:
---
It doesnt do that, all it does it stop you from being able to hit them, not them hit you. They would be able to push your friend in the water and all that either way.
---
They can still hit you in pacifiist, you cant hit them.
---
I see it now. Guess t65 is only good for bragging rights and looks. Glad my friend convinced me to go SS armor instead. Fusion coreless jetpack is fun
---
He he I‚Äôm considering it  as well but the raiders have a cool super mutant so idk
---
There was some drama a while back. Neither side really won afaik and it just resulted in some amount of people in the Fallout community to hate Oxhorn
---
My 15 year old is really into fortnight. Soon as this nw challenge reward thing popped up she leveled me up. 10mm sharkpaint some power amour skins ghillie suit is awsome.
---
I know right I have 1 shot gunner perk up to level 3 everything except the lvl 62 s mutants get one shot they take 2 lol
---
I think he was going for "FaLlOuT 76 dOeSn't HaVe NpC's!!!!"
---
Ah - I don't need to take her down any faster than I do now.
---
That's not reportable, he engaged them in a fight and they killed him.
---
Don¬¥t get people and there "Free update" crap. This game wasn¬¥t even half finished at release. With wastelanders they reached the point wehre people got what 60 bucks get you with any other game. NOW were getting free content, which gets payed by atoms, which they were already selling when the game was basicly early acces.
---
When buy a coffee which only contains water and you recieve the beans a year later, THATS NOT FREE CONTENT. Its damage controll.
---
That beeing said i would be completly ok with removing atoms completly from the game IF they then also remove fallout first and give everyone there scrap chest. Then the game is, as promised only supported by the Atoms. Of course you also have to remove every none cosmetic item.
---
But thats never gona happen, so yea ^^ The only reason this game is online and not singelplay is the atom store. If you play in private realm with first you have the same/ a better experience then on the normal realm. 
---
They hoped forced online stop the modders so they can sell there cosmetics by "killing of the competion" and make more money this way then by releasing DLCs like far harbor.
---
Only problem with this plan is using the creation engine for an online game it clearly cant handle. Now costs are higher then expected, sales are low because of bad critics and bethesda is desperate for money because they thought this whole sceam would bring in way more money then a singelplayer game with all new assets.
---
Thats not really a supprising problem, I see these kind of things happen very often in the software industry. Of course you cant ripp of people as easily as in the gaming industry, because companys will sue your ass of, but miscalculations for software projects are basicly the norm.
---
... yes im bored ^^
---
Wish I knew how.  I ran into the camp i got trapped by a second time and all I could do was steal his veggies and mess with his pylons connecting his powered door which he instantly ran over to turn back on.
---
Yep I started working on them, some of them are crazy but I've been doing the scout dailies when they aren't bugged and working on the challenges hopefully I'll have my backpack mod soon. Could sure use it cause I seem to always be over weight and I have a full box too.
---
Unyielding, and there's no contest, especially if you're a stealth commando who likely isn't going to be tanking damage anyway.
---
The only reason a Bloodied might entertain Bolstering is in lieu of having an Unyielding piece.  Like, if you were crafting the Secret Service gear and you rolled a Bolstering AP piece, that'll probably suffice.
---
Unless it‚Äôs claimed by you the game will consider it someone else‚Äôs while locked. If it isn‚Äôt locked it‚Äôs free game.
---
Leeloo multipass?
---
I dunno, I bought the game at release and loved it, played the hell out of it. Continued to play for awhile after finishing all the quests then got distracted and played other stuff. But after wastelanders I got nostalgic and bought it again for pc. Got to end game again and loving it to the point of buying a year of 1st.
---
Sure it has and had its problems but I loved it even from the beginning. They even added more storage space and backpacks which was awesome.
---
This guy Red Queens.
---
Not true, that's been changed now. Test it if you don't believe me ;) they do no damage while you're in pacifist.
---
IMO it would be stupid to completely ignore the mode and the player. If there's one daily NW challenge like today, it would be optimal. There would still be other non-NW challenger for Adventure players and NW players would have a challenge to do.
---
I‚Äôm also on this boat
---
We haven‚Äôt changed any of the Lifetime Challenges and they will not be updated with each Season, so you will still be able to complete them and earn their one-time Atom rewards.
---
nice try hahaha. you seem clearly offended. in fact you are :)
---
4 endurance tho
---
THIS! People are living far too extravagantly for my liking. We need more dereliction please, Toddy. I've managed to build a rough-and-ready Fallout 4-esque Raider character but my camp has always been lacking that scrappy Fallout feel :(.
---
I‚Äôd like them to introduce a more penalizing system to future factions in the actions you decide with for their quests but still be able to buy back their trust like a bounty paid for if your in the deep shits. Also raiders and foundation should be able to defend themselves against the player. It‚Äôs become very one sided.
---
Accurate
---
If you‚Äôre on XB1 I have 3 pieces of UNY armor and a bloodied pump shotgun (only lvl 5 sadly). Would trade them for very low offer. Almost scrapped for because no takers in vending this past week, no 3 stars so I guess not ideal, but for starter kit they are.
---
It's okay bro, reading is hard. Lifetime challenges are not daily/weekly challenges.
---
look i understand you are mad cause i broke a rule. just let me get that video and ill send it to you. Perhaps you dont play NW so you cant understand why we are always se same 30 players and Desemos always wins and try to look legit here. juste give me time
---
That would be terrifying to just encounter in the dark
---
Maybe if I felt Bethesda would listen or care. I just don't at this point. There's already plenty of player suggestions, some are even decent or good, but it's clearly not swaying them to make it.
---
I think you should contact playstation support and see what they say.  If it's anything like xbox support the people over there are literally 1000x more helpful than all the people who work for 76 and eso support put together.
---
Very nice. Quick tip if I may. If you are running a bloodied stealth commando build you will realize that you don't need chameleon at all with the proper perk set up. Nothing will see you. And if they do it's game over anyway. And that one piece of armor turned to unyielding is much more beneficial than any chameleon piece. Not to poo poo the party but I'm level 500 and someone wiser than me gave me that information a few hundred levels ago and thought I would pass it along. If you are comfy with chameleon then cheers. But getting rid of that chameleon piece made the difference in a quick solo on the Queen for me. You can check out Angry Turtle's video on stealth....
---
About diminishing returns. Hope it helps.

https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hcpn39/is_secret_service_armor_really_the_best/
---
LMAO! This is absolute hilarious apologist BS, man. The constant monetization of this game is definitely from greed. I dont know if youve forgotten, but we all already bought the game. They got our money and we deserve a product. Theres no relying ln further microtransactions required - we bought what was originally a full price game.
---
Add this all to the fact there's nothing to buy in the Atom store worthwhile and its a done deal - they just honestly don't care about this game. They want to milk it, take money from whoever will give it to them through the Atom shop and Fallout 1st, and make off like a bandit as all of that is purchases after the initial larger purchase of the video game. 
---
I hope you choose to smarten up about these business practices instead of buying directly into the bullshit, literally to the point where you think you need to bite the bullet on microtransactions to keep a million-dollar game by a billion-dollar company afloat. These are not necessary, and you deserve game support without microtransactions. Plenty of games by smaller companies have done so.
---
Meme content is perfect for cash shops because if they kept all cool looking serious skins behind paywalls people would complain. Meme skins probably sell better than ‚Äúserious‚Äù skins.
---
I rolled my first unyielding chest last night. Unyeilding  wwr +luck only took about 40 rolls. Idk if I want to start buying limbs
---
Build a small camp and the go to [the Wayward](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=30494).
---
&gt; Bethesda created a monster when they over priced literally everything in the shop. 
---
I'd love to see a AAA game price cosmetics cheap and try the Walmart method, they'll buy a lot more that way. But most go with being very pricey. They can sell me a whole game for $40-$60 dollars, but a few skins cost as much as the full game, I haven't been able to get over that anywhere.
---
They said you can rank up in an average of 2 hours each rank, there are 100 ranks and you have 3 months to complete the season pass so you have more than enough time, there's no need to waste atoms with the season pass. 
---
Also when they release this season they will also remove every daily and weekly challenges that gives you atoms so you will need to pay real money if you want atoms or wait 3 months to get 1500 atoms after completing this season pass versus the 6500 atoms that we can get in 3 months now...
---
So I modded the 2shot/limb damage and I gotta say, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be lacking. Primed, it‚Äôs got crazy high damage and the Vats isn‚Äôt too inconsistent and the Instigating/bash/fmswa with sneak is pretty damn good. 
---
Waiting on decent Bloodied roll though, fucking three legendary modules a day is bogus. 
---
(Coach Klein) ‚Äú I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs not for ‚Äúfree karma‚Äù lmao I only use Reddit for FO76
---
Yeah the leveling grind has been what's really kept me from trying new builds. 1k+ hours on 1 toon.
---
Lolwut - NPCs have been in the game since Day 1. Humans, on the other hand...
---
It happened to me again at the end of Heart of the Swamp. So irritating! Not sure if it is doing it because I'm in PA, when I use my ultracite gatling laser, or something else altogether.
---
Your assessment is very good. Just thought the chem factor would be a beneficial aspect to your readers. Cheers mate...
---
Then tell me: what does he add as an INDIVIDUAL character? Not what his company adds, not what his robots adds, because those things are not something he adds to the game as a character, that's something he added to the lore of franchise, and that is not something he does as an individual character in 76.
---
You can't say a character is relevant to a game, if he's not playing a part that actually affects the game.
---
Yea I'm on PS4 and I can check later when I get on. 
---
Wow I don't get why people grief like honestly what do they get out of it other then sick enjoyment. But glad you was able to repair your place.
---
Globe has never been a free item.  It was bugged a long time ago and anyone could place it, and it was fixed the patch after that.
---
People are buying atoms, and did you forget about fallout 1st?
---
Tried that. If there‚Äôs a way to create a support ticket where I can actually explain my issue, I can‚Äôt find it. All I can find is a bot that (shockingly) does not have my unique issue within his list of stock answers, so it can‚Äôt help me
---
Amazing! Have you tried out fast firing Heavy Weapons that are *magic* yet?
---
but the atom story is only skins no? the only useful thing is the Colector and the repair kits
---
I‚Äôll be waiting. 
---
You also must realize that just because somebody has one username here, doesn‚Äôt meant they‚Äôre the same person somewhere else. There‚Äôs an entirely separate person with my username on Twitter, and another completely separate one on Steam, and so on. And I don‚Äôt see how this could be hard to understand, but if my day wasn‚Äôt ruined because of this, I wouldn‚Äôt be mad over it either. Again, it‚Äôs amusing to watch people defend breaking that rule here.
---
Hit me up later then, I should be on in about 4/5 hours.
---
Alrighty I'll make sure to do those and I'll let my buddy know about pacifist mode too.
---
damn.. that sucks.  Microsoft support has always been really great with me it sucks that Sony support is shitty :/
---
Okay thank you for this info. Was making a bar and a little salty now I can‚Äôt place my center globe and piano set up
---
Did you lock your doors last night so Todd couldn‚Äôt break in and install it. 
---
Edit: No, wait. If it was Todd he would‚Äôve installed Skyrim instead.
---
No I've only ever used my shot gun haven't needed to try anything that's something you'd recommend is it
---
Look under your services tab, not subscription
---
Uh duhhh, it‚Äôs that level 30 gun you get as a quest reward? It‚Äôs kinda neat for leveling but higher level players ought to switch to a max level combat rifle. Also, who‚Äôs that mean invisible assaultron and why can‚Äôt I damage her??? /s
---
If you feel embarrassed playing video games then just stop. Games are supposed to bring fun and enjoyment, not embarrassment
---
Ah, a fellow Grafton Dam catfish.
---
And it does not stop you from stealing from other players,
---
It might not be, it‚Äôs entirely possible that I‚Äôm dumb. But I can‚Äôt for the life of me find anywhere where I can just like send an email saying ‚ÄúThis is exactly what‚Äôs borked, can y‚Äôall fix it?‚Äù
---
The thing that grated me about MrMattyPlays was when 76 came out, he had many criticisms of it, which most people did.  But he threw in this weird caveat, to the effect of "Don't bother with this game until I tell you it's okay."  And I just thought that was a rather self-aggrandizing way of reviewing something.  It's fine to say you didn't like it, or to suggest that it isn't worth the viewer's time, but to go one step further and nominate yourself as the lone arbiter of "when something becomes good" - that's a bit arrogant.
---
Not exactly. The characters we meet through the main story are not random people, and neither are the companions, because all those npc have a name, and you get to connect with them, even if it's just through holotapes like the old overser quests. They affect the game and the world be play in. 
---
House does not add or affect anything to/in the game in any way. He's literally just a name on a terminal.
---
Games have been comimg out in "Betas" for the past 10yrs the name means nothing anymore and it is just an excuse developers use to ship whats known as an MVP(minimum viable product).
---
Bruh why you such a joke killer
---
did you try giving them a call at  1-800-345-7669?
---
might be worth a shot.  best of luck!
---
I probably spent ¬£300 before I joined Fallout 1st and haven't spent anything since then, I also stopped playing for a few months and wouldn't log on until they updated my account with the monthly Atoms bundle from Fallout 1st. I would then pick up the monthly camp bundle (1200 atoms), and log out. 
---
Since Wastelanders dropped I've played frequently. I don't have your dedication to daily playing to amass that many atoms. so I won't see your level of atom generation, however, having looked at the first season We will still get 1350 atoms from completing all the ranks. so about 400 atoms a month is enough for me along with my Fallout 1st subscription.    
---
1st FO Season

I've got the video of it on my PC will share later tonight

Installed through what? Bethesda launcher or steam?
---
this! early invest in int!
---
100% I have thousands of flux because I trade for it. I'm lazy and HATE that grind. :)
---
no clue, never bothered looking into it. but while i do agree it ruins the economy, its entirely bethesdas fault.

I typically get 3 crates on average 4 if I'm lucky. When solo
---
100% agree.
---
Alrighty, my psn is Firehawk_Chaos btw
---
Been in there, all it gives me as options is PSPlus, PSNow, PSVideo and PSMusic
---
Cool, thanks for answering - I figured abandoning the workshop would have made it free game anyway but I am not really up on how they work, hence the questions but at least I've learnt something new lol
---
TRUTH!
---
Bang up job mate, nicely done.
---
And they made it so the casual player will almost have to but ranks on the scoreboard to finish at 100
---
Was hoping to avoid that, I hate talking on the phone, but desperate times I guess üòÖ
---
As others have already mentioned, Angry Turtle.
---
What sets him apart is that he actually does the work to test and understand why things are the way they are, instead of just regurgitating what someone else said.  He discovered that the Shrouded/Shadowed mods on armor only work on Leather Armor and nothing else.  He also discovered the specific Legendary effects that trigger the bizarre "magic shotgun" quirk, *including the effect on armor*, which probably would have escaped most people because... I mean... why would an obscure armor effect ever change the behavior of shotguns in VATS?
---
It's very fun to try. You need a weapon with fire rate around 200, or 100 if it has an Explosive effect. Then one of the following makes it *magic*: Instigating, Junkies, Medic, Stalkers, Bashing, Limb or 33VATs. After a few shots, to the same area on an enemy, it kicks in like Furious on steroids. It's fucking crazy!
---
It‚Äôs the AIDS owl
---
Are you trolling?
---
Why bother commenting this three times.  And no, I don‚Äôt play their sports games and I don‚Äôt pay attention to the news for them.  Because it‚Äôs pretty obvious they‚Äôre nothing special.  But at least they aren‚Äôt on creation engine.
---
Lol, you just proved you did not read, or at least not understand, what i wrote. I'm saying he's as relevant as an individual character in 76, as a random unnamed npc, because he does not add or affect anything to/in the game. He's literally just a name on a terminal, nothing more.
---
What he has done in earlier games does not make him relevant as a 76 game character, because then he's a relevant game character in all the fallout games he's not even mentioned in, and that's just dumb. He is not his company, so he's not a relevant character in 76 just because his company is relevant.
---
look at his posts on reddit regarding trading. he says clearly same ign as username on reddit.
---
And the implementation is there already. In several Wastelanders quests you do travel with someone, the Overseer, RaRa, Weasel, Jen etc. and the actual raid has you in a group, which was a blast to play.
---
So stop playing the game and move on. Whining about it on reddit is not any less masturbatory than what you perceive here.
---
 Nice.  I knew they stack but not that much.
---
You will earn less atoms but you will get a lot more free stuff. The problem is that it might be stuff you don't want. 
---
Think they are pushing FO1 more by doing this?
---
I am indeed on xb1! Yea no need for multiple stars since I‚Äôll get rid of them at 50 after it‚Äôs easier to farm!
---
And not just the workshop stuff. Anything in the area previously claimed will be owned by the workshop claimer. I happened to pick a locked toolbox that was not placed using the workshop but was a natural spawn and i got flagged.
---
I saw this same thing happen with raiders.
---
Brahmin, two traders, and a diseased dog just absolutely hualing ass across the toxic Valley.
---
Was really disappointed I couldn't even trade with them.
---
I heard they manage their crunch well though.  Not 100% on that but just something I heard
---
side note, we need access to our galleries online. it is just plain silly to me that they are stored locally. played on a different console and i was so confused as to why i was seeing stock images on the load screen
---
I didn't think about that, it could be.
---
Different mule or pack animal or bot skins in the Shop too ? Sold lol
---
If they start fixing the BUGS in the game that are causing people to leave in mass and STOP adding cute cosmetic stuff in the atom shop that people will not buy because they are leaving due to game breaking bugs (VATS!) that they refuse to address I might buy some atoms.
---
I have lots saved up as well though because I have been playing since the beginning and I have already purchased the cosmetic stuff I want.
---
I actually haven‚Äôt done Charleston yet!
---
Angry Turtle brought me here. Thank you so much guys. Great work !!!
---
What‚Äôs a battle bass?
---
Enjoy it.  Look for the little unique things in the gabe.. like two soldiers talking about what chems they prefer around a camp fire. 
---
Don't try and concentrate too much on levelling as you'll just lose interest.
---
Pretty much focus on doing quests and events. Most bang for your buck in terms of XP. Also leverage as many xp boosters as possible i.e. sleep (ideally with ally to get +1hr extra), cranberry relish for +10%, do the path of enlightenment event when it shows (the one with the lighthouse).
---
Leveling a new character is either something you enjoy or something you dread.  
---
I‚Äôve leveled up eight characters across two acounts...I enjoy seeing them develop. I enjoy using my knowledge of the game dynamic to my advantage.  
---
For instance, when leveling up, I don‚Äôt bother carrying lots of Radaway, just use the free shower at Blackwater Mine.  Disease cures, why bother?, there is a fountain at Whitespring Golf Club to fix that.  Get better armor, why?, I‚Äôll be leveling past it in another hour or two.  Death and respawn is much faster.   
---
For me, it‚Äôs as much fun as end game.
---
I don‚Äôt want to the math on how many hours that was. But you madd Crazy bro. it‚Äôs funny how we created new characters to compensate for the lack of a perk load out system.
---
and btw. I might be french but i'm not stupid. Don't need to explain me things about account names as if im a kid. Your'e nothing but on OP on reddit ;)
---
I would like that more than broken defense quests that don't spawn mobs.
---
I‚Äôve never thought of it that way. Thanks!
---
It is a big deal when you despise playing Battle Royal.  In my opinion it's a game mode designed for kids with short attention spans that want instant gratification.
---
I've tried joining groups and sitting in bushes but even that is tedious af.  The two mode should be separate.
---
 I shouldn't be forced to play a shit mode because there are rewards I want for a completely different mode.
---
700 for the entire lot, the armor and the shotgun, if that sounds ok. rather they go to someone who can actually use them vs someone just buying to resell immediately. I can hold them if need be. Also, the game seems to know that I don‚Äôt wear unyielding because it keeps sending it my way. I could let you know when I find the next pieces. Have won/found about 10-12 pieces in the last 3-4 weeks.
---
Pro tip: After dealing with the cap in the big room, you don't have to push the button. You can go past the gate on the right side and hunt for the rest of the crates without enemies coming (with the rare occasion of a random pack of dogs spawing or the mole rats/mole men that will spawn when you go down the tunnels). Usually I have about 20 minutes left after killing the captain to find the remaining 2-3 missing crates. 
---
The brahman will sit there on the other side of the closed gate and heal to full while you go and get the lost crates. Once you have them, go back to the room and push the button. Then just follow and guard the caravan with no added pressure.
---
If you feel ashamed playing games then stop, it's a choice, so...just stop. Why are you embarrassed for other people? Games are meant to be fun, lots of people will find things fun that you don't, you don't sound like you are having fun, so for the sake of your own sanity I suggest you move on.
---
Why are you even here?
---
Maybe you should find something more productive to do with your time than complain about a game you obviously hate.
---
Damn straight. Save your ammo. Let the melee guys do their work. It's just business.
---
That's awesome! I'm from Pittsburgh and alot of the settlers are from Pittsburgh or "the Pitt", I love hearing them talk about "Yinz"! It makes sense since Pittsburgh is only a few hours north of most of West Virginia
---
It wasn't a score afterall. Too bad
---
Thanks, its one of my favourite events and with all the threads popping up about it the last few days I figured I'd help put some info out there about it
---
Nuclear Winter really isn't a bad idea.
---
It's just been woefully neglected because they seemed to treat it as a one-and-done affair and didn't realize that it would require constant maintenance and updates to keep the cheaters and exploiters out.
---
Every PvP game ends up being an arms race between developers and those who attack it.  If they aren't prepared to deal with that, they shouldn't be making PvP modes.
---
congrats
---
i'll prob hit neighborly today ;(
---
Indeed, they need money to keep servers running but there are better options than remove the only incentive to log in every day and week after completing all content and nerf the quantity of atoms that we could get  into oblivion.
---
They can add more benefits to 1st, like exclusive skins or items or release a 'basic' 1st so more people get it or even add new mechanics and skins that require atoms like the collectron, they could do that with the new pet system that they will release, etc.
---
Also with the current system, you can always log in to get atoms every day but with this change if you reach rank 90 and you're not interested in the rest of rewards you won't play more until next season or content update. I can't really see it like a content improvement if we lose what we already got and get more cons than benefits.
---
Nearly 3k atoms without spending money. And yea its normal that they use microtransactions to fund future updates. I just wished the prices wernt as steep as they are and maybe, just maybe id spend some cash to get some items. Now i just feel like anything id buy would be a waste of my free atoms.
---
is this in general, or with the gauss shotgun specifically?
---
Nono, i'm not going to disagree with that point at all, because it makes sense. My only problem is how people still try to say house is a relevant individual character in 76, because he's not.
---
I only said it was fair game to complain, because he's TECHNICALLY not a character in 76. I won't argue with the mods, because it's up to them to decide if something is allowed or not + i already said that mentioning house on a topic, about robco for example, would make him relevant since he's the founder.
---
I suggest you don‚Äôt open the ‚Äúboss gate‚Äù until u get all the crates at least until you have a good run down and get the groove so to speak
---
UY is not harder to get, it‚Äôs RNG.
---
Just hang in there . You will eventually get it
---
There's no way Bethesda don't know what makes a popular cosmetic add on, they've been relying on modders adding value to their games for years, they can even look at their own mod hosting site to see what's frequently rated and downloaded
---
If anyone doesn't know what being a "bushwookie" means, it's simply finding a bush and AFKing as long as possible as you get more exp from surviving than killing people. This [video](https://youtu.be/TRH6KChs9cM) can provide some tips.
---
You really don't need to do that though, if you know where the crates are then once you press the button and the brahmin start moving again, you have more than enough time to find the last 2 crates while the brahmin slowly walk across the chamber, there are no enemy spawns until they make it into the next part of the tunnel and even then its not a 100% chance to spawn dogs, which means there may be no enemy spawns until the next chamber, which is 2+ minutes of "dead time" after opening the gate, more than enough time to grab the last crates.  
---
The guide lists every possible crate spawn location, there are only a handful of places crates can spawn after the captain fight and once you learn them, it takes about 30 seconds to get them both.
---
People downvoting Op are denying the inevitable.
---
Then again microtransactions have pretty much never been micro, even at the beginning. IIRC Horse armor was something like $2.50
---
For one more texture out of many thousands already in the game, and for one more model, of which there's also thousands of in the game.
---
I tend to think of it like this for any game with cosmetics. You buy it and play and you have access to say 30 diferent outfits included in the price tag. Considering everything else in the game, the outfits make up maybe 1% at best of the work done on the game. A single outfit's value is then really something like 0.03% of the price tag. About 2 cents for a $60 game.
---
But then they charge you 10+ dollars for a single outfit, or just a color filtered texture with the same model.
---
As far as I could tell picking up the crates doesnt make you any more likely to get good rewards.
---
If quests get too hard, then level up and come back with more experience and better gear.  
---
Dont think you have to have the perfect build by level 50; most builds arent matured until level 60 or higher.
---
 If you run into trouble regarding character development, ask around.  Lots of good folks in FO76.
---
 If you havent discovered these 2 gems:
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Happy hunting
---
Yes, same here.
---
This also leads to the interesting phenomenon of my forgetting to actually *loot the Queen*.
---
Maybe if they actually put stuff in the atom shop worth spending irl money on.
---
Awesome pic! Today I met a vengeful mothman for the first time! I was clearing out the area around the tadpole camp when I saw him in the distance near the tadpole vending machine. I shot him once with my Junkie's LAR, then he teleported closer to me. I proceeded to kill him before he could disappear.  It was pretty cool!
---
You‚Äôve spent a lot of time playing this game and learning.   Leveling up a new character is sort of a test....have I really learned anything?  I bet you can have a lot of fun challenging yourself with this!
---
Since there are going to be challenges I think we are going to actually have to play. Idk if it'll just be play X amount of games or survive X amount of time
---
It happens all the time. I‚Äôve had to restart the dialog up to 10 times.
---
Just saying it makes it easier my guy!
---
Honestly, I'd probably start again, its what I did upon returning, but then I was only giving up a mid 30s character, not a 150+.   
---
Assuming you completed all content prior to the wastelanders update, then just head to the wayward or go see the overseer to start with the new questlines.
---
Eh, i still think it's fair to complain, if he's simply mentioned without context. It's fucking dumb, but fair.
---
I have been very clear on the "not a relevant individual character in 76" part, so i would say people who kept saying i was wrong are still wrong. He is indeed not a relevant character in 76, only his company is relevant.
---
Enjoy the game.  Appreciate the expanse of WV.  It‚Äôs a fun game just to play casually.  Begin to consider what type of build (rifleman/commando/heavy, mele)so you can pick perks as you level that support that build, which you probably won‚Äôt fully realize till level 60 or so.  Nuke dragons (google it) has a great build planner and example builds to guide you on which perks.  You can shift points as you level after 50 so you can change later.  
---
Hopefully you can get a decent legendary weapon that‚Äôll get you to level 50.  For me it was a two-shot lever with 50% limb damage that carried me through the early game till I rolled something better.   
---
You see a lot of posts about meta/OP, especially bloodied commando build which is what I run now at lvl 200.  But I was a full health rifleman up to level 65 ish.  You want the highest level for the best gear for end game which is above level 50.  
---
All my opinion of course so take with a grain of salt.  Enjoy the game.  Despite the hate it‚Äôs gotten, I love it.  It‚Äôs not perfect, but then again...neither am I.
---
I've tried this, but it seems like I'm doing something wrong. She never falls, she just stands beside her chair and teleports. I can make Collectron fall easily enough tho.
---
I think it's just lag.  The order to spawn the enemies is probably sent before the Queen dies, and she ends up dead before the server gets around to processing it.
---
And fridges, but why would someone pay atoms for repairs kits when you can get them free? I would rather spend them in a skin that I can't get by any other means than waste them in something I can get free. Also you can repair items more with certain perk cards than with a repair kit.
---
ps: friges gives you a 50% reduced spoil time but there's a perk card that can gives you a 90% reduced spoil time and some backpack modules too
---
I really rather them have fixed the base game then do paid dlc with minimum shop input
---
Can you imagine how much their real lives must suck they have to resort to video game to get some sense of power over others. It‚Äôs just pathetic really.
---
70+ GB download that you didn't notice, you must have stellar internet speed.
---
don't forget the Feeding the People event for the canned meat stew reward!
---
For a few years I was in Monroe for work. I ate at Bill‚Äôs and McGowan‚Äôs more than I care to admit!
---
Damn, that some corny shit.
---
Just like the fireplace "dirt tiles" we got early last year.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Awesome!
---
To be a stickler though.. the new river gorge frame is for the resort... not the bridge. :-P
---
True now. I‚Äôm hella sad I didn‚Äôt get strangleheart a month or two ago before they fixed the jet packs.
---
Here for Battle Bass
---
And am pretty sure each piece of armor adds an additional pt to specials, one to INT and the other to AGI, I think. So, not a bad second star.
---
It happens. I did over 100 runs of the event. I got lucky. But honestly ive been enjoying not having the armor cuz ive been end game for awhile now so its giving me something to do. And though foolish, imma put my faith bethesda will let us craft the helmet again
---
Haha I know right?! Can we please call it what it's called
---
Not from Monroe myself but it was so nice meeting someone else from Connecticut all the way down there in WV.
---
The only voice worse than RifleGaming is SH Games.
---
I really enjoy Kevduits videos, but it looks like hes taking a break from FO76 until new content gets added.
---
It works with all Shotguns, in VATs. All you need is a Shotgun with one of the following effects: Instigating, Junkies, Bashing, Limb or 33VATs. Or you could wear one armor piece with Blocking as an effect, with any Shotgun. Insane amount of damage in VATs! 
---
-
---
Also works without using VATs on high fire rate weapons, with around 200 fire rate, or 100 with an Explosive effect. Medic &amp; Stalkers also work with these weapons (but not Shotguns). You'll be blown away honestly!
---
That works for me I‚Äôll grab it! I might have a chance tonight around 7:30 CST. And please do! I just started getting dangerously close to the 30k cap on my main so I literally just buy shit off people to scrip it if I can or buy bulk ammo to sell later.
---
It‚Äôs not, no word on if it will be added next patch.
---
Are you talking about scrap kits? Or something different? Because scrap kits already are (and have been, for a while now) in the atom shop...
---
I keep track of where the tents are and then forget to keep track of where she died once in a while.  I've had a few times where I had to spend a few minutes trying to figure out where the massive corpse ended up.  
---
Doesn't seem like it should be all that hard considering the size of it lol.
---
At least they should start the banwave in PC. You can see people flying/clipping oneshooting the hole server in less than 5 min, every 3 or 4 matches üòÇ
---
I love battle drums, but battle bass sounds awesome :)
---
I disagree, since Nuclear Winter was clearly just an attempt to jump on trends and more chips went into its creation than something like Survival mode.  They chose to rely on making their own clone of a popular thing as their go-to PvP mode and haven't bothered to really explore other more simple avenues like deathmatches, or capture-the-flag.  They probably expected an audience just based on it being a popular genre clone rather than it being good from its own merits, and that doesn't seem like anything other than a bad idea.
---
You're right about that other part though, it is woefully neglected and that might be the problem with any and all future PvP modes for 76.  Bethesda can barely support basic features for Adventure mode in a respectable timeframe, so it's not even a shock they can barely juggle maintaining their PvP modes on top of that.
---
Maybe a friend installed it in  free weekend to get you to play.
---
Hey u/LadyDevann - seems like someone could use some Bethesda help
---
It was never intentionally given out as a free item.  It was accidentally available to everyone for a few days.  Those who placed one during that time got to keep it.
---
I have mine still stored, in fact.  Mostly because I have no idea what would happen if I were to place it and it got destroyed.  Would it allow me to rebuild it?  Or would it force me to buy it? üòÇ
---
There's a big difference between power armors.   His logic is stupid.  He demonstrates that you only take 3 less damage from a single hit.  He demonstrates this by standing in front of a single enemy that is very slowly chipping away at his health.
---
That isn't how actual combat encounters work. In actual combat,  when you are being hit by a dozen enemies at once,  3 less damage adds up very quickly.
---
on my first character? bloodied stealth shotgunner with melee and heavy gunner perks
---
You'll get there someday. Angry Turtle was ultra obscure until fairly recently.
---
For what it's worth, I know who you are and have seen some of your content. Keep it up bud :)
---
Does extra damage to players. Practically useless now since PvP is so dumbed down.
---
Yeah that's the huge thing is it's going to be unplayable for the pc players who aren't cheating if there are challenges for wins or kills. Glad on on ps4 where its actually a fair game
---
I didn‚Äôt know those worked too I‚Äôm going to start placing those at peoples camps too üòÅ
---
Everyone who's played over 3 hours of the game is likely to have had this one
---
I appreciate your input, however, Its a farming guide, I'm all about trying to minimise time spent per event to maximise your potential rewards. Knowing the crate spawn locations, there is no reason to hold up the event to search for them, especially because there are no enemy spawns for between 1 and 2 minutes while the brahmin are moving through the captains chamber and adjoining tunnel.
---
Well, the game does cost money itself still so they‚Äôre still making money off that. Everything from the atom shop is just gravy.
---
Think of it like fortnite though. I‚Äôve never bought a single thing from the game. Many of my friends have never bought a single skin. But my cousin has spent over $100 on the game. My best friend has spend at least $400. And My BIL has spend over $300.
---
For every dozen (made up number) or so people that don‚Äôt buy anything or buy occasionally, there‚Äôs probably one guy who spends enough to make up for that dozen.
---
Angry Turtle and Innov Survivalist
---
I read somewhere else on here that right now any hit in VATs with the gauss shotgun is as if it is fully charged. Mine is instigating and I can 1 shot a mirelurk queen in VATs but outside of VATs it takes about 2-3 shots.
---
Ah a fellow Connecticut lad I see.
---
Ye! For the firespit you can only have a max of two, and I think the communal own from the atomic shop counts for that as well. But the satellite, at least about a month ago, can be placed down for others.
---
Frankly, it just needs a new set bonus that gives poison and disease resist instead of a poison aura that literally does zero damage and an on-hit acid damage that barely shows up on level one scorched.
---
But if you're saving things for display they're taking up space anyway right?
---
You very much don't - You're thinking of it from the perspective of a directed campaign ala Dungeons and Dragons rather than open freeform RP present in every MMORPG on the market.
---
Still pissed I deleted mine on accident when moving camp a while back.  Don't miss it enough to actually buy it, but it was pretty cool.
---
That too but I don't think it stacks with the relish from memory
---
Don't fight at your base. If people show up there and start attacking you there is a 99% chance they want to destroy it.
---
"  I want people to be rewarded on the level of difficulty they can deal with. Thing is, the engine isn't capable of hosting truly interesting combat tactics (just silly bugged ones). "
---
This is actually true but the rest of the post is absolutely ridiculous and I feel kind of bad for agreeing with even part of it.
---
also add in 1 gun fu and 1 adrenaline for a big damage increase
---
you want a bloodied but if you cannot be bothered with sorting out a build try and get a junkies really. it's as easy as getting 5 addictions. most things will die with one hit without either of those though.
---
\*FOMO Time Sync
---
Congrats dude
---
Not sure about the deep-pocketed mods. I did hear AngryTurtle mention in his PTS video that the SS under armor shielded mod will be available in Patch 20...
---
Assassins gear is pretty much a legendary slot that does absolutely nothing.
---
Is the only advantage of getting the crates extra caps? I did this once without finding a single crate.
---
I want to say I saw it mentioned in the update 20 notes somewhere, but that may have just been the underarmour upgrades.
---
Well in that case, there have been hundreds of happy birthday karma whore posts and everyone is getting sick and tired of them.
---
Woah I was just recommended your channel a few days ago,I was watching your videos on the solar armor and the best locations to do junkie dailies
---
sinseer is the best fallout 76 youtuber. lmao
---
I like all your ideas, though I do think they're less pressing at the moment for Roleplay than the two points of Text Chat and Player Guilds. That being said, you're on console so RP in general is going to work extremely differently for you - So I can definitely understand your points from that perspective.
---
Useless. They could've at least had the courtesy to make it apply to human npcs.
---
I bought atoms once or twice before 1st came out. I am a 1st subscriber (did the year thing). I don't mind throwing $15 a month at a game I enjoy. It is pretty much the only game I play. Getting to old and too many things going on in life to play a lot.
---
I had to back out to the menu and select the shop again a few times to get it to load properly.
---
It adds weight. I sometimes remove all mods to save space.
---
Deals 10% extra damage against players, but functionally useless because damage is capped at 110/190 per hit, not sure on the exact number.
---
With a standard single action using 3 ranks of gunslinger and bloody mess, prime takes you from 114 damage to 142.6
---
If its a junkies single action prime takes you from 171.12 to 213.9. 
---
Thats a pretty significant improvement. Especially when targeting heads and sneaking
---
Ok where did you get that her landing event is based on proximity? I‚Äôd love to hear this. 
---
You can‚Äôt stagger the Queen at all. She is immune to stagger at this point.
---
Relevant to my interest. Just recently found out there are magic shotguns with this effect. I got a bloodied with limp dmg and a Q3325 one. And its rly hard to test for me which is stronger. Cause they both oneshot so much.
---
Hopefully you don‚Äôt use those on a public server.
---
Using crippling perks to force her to land doesn't work anymore. Bethesda said it wasn't intentional and they were looking into it, and hasn't done a damn thing about it.
---
Thank you kaltzahn üòâ
---
As long as you don't scrap it, you can repair it. Damned molerats have destroyed mine more times than I can count.
---
His [other video did that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6H4j2rRo4) and he got criticized for testing small hits from stuff like mutants.  Taking 3 or 4 damage in excavator, t45, t51b.  About 3 in T60, Ultracite/Strangler, and maybe 2.5 in T65 but IMO he tested T65 wrong since it was against a different mutant using an automatic rifle.  And automatics do less per shot damage.
---
So in short, no it's not really worth the month grind because it doesn't really offer any more protection than the stuff you can pickup for free in the game world.
---
From what I can gather, it only affects your cap reward, but I've no idea if it changes your chances of getting an outfit or plan, I want to say it does (as these are apparantly considered rare and I have had dozens of outfits and plans etc. drop since I started farming it). but I can't be sure, would need to see datamined info for that I guess.
---
Darn PC critters...
---
It‚Äôs not fair to complain based upon using the rules of the sub to support the complaint. 
---
That‚Äôs the point. That‚Äôs what started all of this. 
---
The rules of the sub were followed by the OP. Therefore complaints about the validity of the post submission are inherently invalid. 
---
End of story. I don‚Äôt care how relevant House is or if he‚Äôs in the game or not. Because that was never part of the original point about the validity of complaints about this post.
---
Don't be one of these lame losers that AFKs in PvP, that is the same as exploiting a glitch for personal gain. It ruins the game for legit PvP players for personal selfish gains.
---
Read my comment I said about my testing I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm right I‚Äôm just saying it was beneficial
---
like I was on sile and all my gear broker I was soloing  at lvl 38 and if I go to camp I would need to restart all  the silo quest again so the repair kit was handy tho.
---
nah I have the canibal perk no need to stack food
---
Thanks!!
---
Nope, I feel the same.
---
TBH I didn't notice an increase in sneak speed when using The Fixer, maybe its bugged?
---
Awesome thanks for that information
---
At the time, Survival was essentially Deathmatch.  It didn't have many takers because, aside from the rampant cheating and Fallout's natural inclination toward PvE, it just wasn't compelling as a game mode.  Kill or be killed, is what it boiled down to.
---
I've always thought that if you wanted to have PvP in Fallout, you needed to model it after something like the Wild West.  Yes, there were gunfights, and yes, people died violently.  But there was consequence.  Permadeath.  A loss of property or limb.  A permanent loss of reputation and unshakeable notoriety.  A dogged Sheriff hunting you down in response.  Things that would *make you think twice* before shooting someone.  That's what was missing from Survival mode: consequence.  A reason for discretion in who you kill.
---
That said, if you're going to do a PvP mode in Fallout, you could do a lot worse than battle royale.  A Bethesda open world lends itself to that idea really well, compared to the dire, barren likes of PUBG.  There are tons of nooks and crannies and varied environments to have firefights in.
---
Are you running speed demon? there's a cap on movement speed.
---
Do you have sleek? Just added it and when i'm crouched (sneaking) the movement speed is exactly the same, i tested it.
---
I‚Äôm a casual, what can I say?
---
You‚Äôre wrong in that you said the complaints were valid. Because the only way the complaints would be valid is if the post violated the rules off the sub. 
---
The post did. It violate the rules of the sub. So you were wrong in claiming their complaints were valid **in that context**. 
---
End of story. All the rest of it is... *irrelevant* to the original point.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
They should change it to 10% dmg to humans
---
You can have them both. I don't understand.
---
You are right. In this case, instead of having it so that we can directly gift atoms or atom store purchases, it would have to be a method where you buy a 'Atom box' with real  money. That 'Atom box' can then be sent to another player. Once the box is opened by another player, it gives that player atoms. This feature has to be completely outside of the actual game otherwise duppers will dup it. So it will have to be a direct purchase from bethesda store (similar to buying a game from them).
---
It's crazy! I sometimes test them on Scorchbeasts or Super Mutant Behemoths (there's one South of Solomons Pond, East of the Blood Eagle Camp).
---
Nope, just check my status effect and a new thing is there called 'Stealth Move' : Move speed +10
---
But i timed it before and after adding pretty accurately and im not moving any quicker :(
---
Mines peb2910. Hopefully I'll have everything you need. I don't have a mic though so might be worth messaging me on here.
---
Huge miss if they aren't included on Tuesday.
---
Here, I can dumb it down for ya: nothing to do (old) + nothing to gain (new) = no need to play!
---
No, I'll need it towards the end of the year when... I mean if Bethesda  releases new content.
---
Correct. The good rewards are only tied to all the brahmin surviving. Crates only give more caps. This was all data-mined.
---
Even of the nw dailies were more score half of the dailies are easy af like deploy camp or take pictures
---
Great, now you know how I feel.
---
Just found: 'Stealth Move' : Move speed +10 in Status.
---
The test i did before was good enough and not running speed demon.
---
It 100% isn't working, i'll try not using the fixer and see.
---
I went through all of that dudes dialogue because I was convinced he was UP TO SOMETHING!! Still highly suspicious.
---
People can damage you actually. Just the ways you can enable them to hurt you are very limited when you have it on.
---
The good thing about NW is you don‚Äôt really have to be good at PVP, you can play pretty stealthy and gear up for the final circles and still have a good time.
---
It's about damn time man, seriously. It's lame as hell we can't sell ammo anyways besides the store. So now things are going to be a little bit easier.
---
OP she isn‚Äôt pretty much immune to explosive damage. Explosive damage doesn‚Äôt add that much extra damage, and she has a very high damage immunity. I want to say it 70% damage immunity. So if explosive damage from an explosive weapon is let‚Äôs say 3 damage then you are hitting for less than 1 additional damage per shot from an explosive weapon.

Toilet paper roll and a few packets of coffeeüëç
---
I felt the same way when I was playing the Fallout NV: Zion valley DLC and Joshua Gray was from and described my hometown haha
---
I kill cat fishes, because unless they got a lever action they can‚Äôt fight back. I always look for them, empty my gun into them from the surface and take their spot... XD
---
They can hit you. It wont do any damage unless you flag yourself for pvp by taking a workshop or becoming wanted.
---
Towards the higher levels, so lets say at season rewards 75+.
---
I think we should wait and see what happens.
---
Can you elaborate? NW is just one way to earn s.c.o.r.e.
---
That's one of the things this game is missing. Unique items at set locations. Alas, it's only important for https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/One_Small_Step
---
There's a Spotify app on PS?
---
I disagree. but I'm not trying to stop you from collecting the crates if you want to
---
It's also a fan theory that 76 is actually some kind of Vault Tec simulation. It would make sense given that Appalachia is never mentioned in any other fallout game, and the various cryptids and scorchbeasts never appear elsewhere.
---
It also makes sense because a lot of things got retconned into 76 that never appear elsewhere -- X-01 armor was not supposed to exist this early, the secret service has T-65, etc etc. On top of that, the stats are all borked -- X-01 is supposed to be the pinnacle of PA, yet here it is roughly equivalent to most other PA.
---
And if you consider the basic structure of a games-as-service, new content needs to be added that has never appeared in any other Fallout game.
---
Thanks man, ill aim to deliver
---
My family is from Barbour Co Wv.  It's great seeing places I've known.  County even got a mention in the Scout tests
---
It seems to happen if the name matches other item names in some way. I don't know if it's a bug or a deliberate safeguard against trying to trick other players with custom names on an item. 
---
An easy way to see this, change your T-51 to T-51b (the actual name of the armor type in Fallout 76). It will change to all caps like the others.
---
I just got a Chameleon, Powered, Cavalier SS left leg the other day. I almost threw my controller.
---
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm getting fed up, the busses is nasty, the busses is filthy, and the busses is not new!‚Äù
---
The official way to lvl up quickly was already explained on here regarding full set unyielding and intelligence with all boosters are the key... for unofficial way i will send you a pm üòú
---
There are a ton of bugs and yes they do not get fixed quickly enough.  I get pretty frustrated too sometimes.  If i get frustrated I go to play a different game for a bit.  It usually helps.
---
Congrats. Regardless of how people feel about it it‚Äôs a huge achievement to finally do it. What level are you out of interest? 
---
I played a lot a long time ago and got to level 76 (weirdly) and never did the I am become death mission. I did go to a few queen nukes but it never beat doing it myself when I came back for wastelanders and did a new character run all the way through. 
---
I was nuking with one friend who did the journey again with me, and then I did my first solo run about level 130.
---
Anyway here‚Äôs to many more!
---
Good to know.  Maybe I'll go and place it now!
---
1 second before i died....

Yup tried and tested with and without the fixer equipped.
---
100% a bug and not getting any bonus at all.
---
Ffs see ya 500 gold.
---
Now now, don‚Äôt be disingenuous. It‚Äôs obvious the atomic store is not doing well because Fallout 1st wasn‚Äôt enough to supplement it, and now Bethesda is cutting peoples‚Äô free atom intake to a quarter of what it was so (it‚Äôs hoped) they‚Äôll burn through any stockpiled atoms and be forced to actually buy some. 
---
Of course, none of this actually addresses the root problem of atomic store content being lacklustre.
---
Very cool!! I used o hang out in Beckly, WV, sometimes in college (VT) in he 80‚Äôs. It‚Äôs really fun when you find a personal connection in the game.
---
You can't seriously be on the side of *bugs*.
---
I‚Äôm not, I just couldn‚Äôt help myself üòÇ
---
I think the card system is ‚Äúneat‚Äù but would have preferred a system like Fallout 4. Level ups really don‚Äôt mean much in 76 to me.
---
Upvoted for recognition!!!
---
You can also put them in Nukashine kegs and I think the pristine Nuka cola machine.
---
Yes, the 'Season Pass' will award _about_ 1/4th the atoms of the (soon to be) former daily and weekly challenge system. That's true.
---
BUT
---
One thing I don't think a lot of people noticed in the PTS (and I don't think this is spoiling anything) is that Bethesda (initially at least) added TONS of new Challenges to the Character/Survival/Combat/Etc. section of the Challenges menu. Now, I'm not going to say for 100% certain these challeneges WILL be in Patch 20, nor will I say that they add up to the ~5,000 atoms you could potentially be missing out on. But I'm fairly certain Bethesda will be adding MORE ways to get MORE atoms besides the (admittedly paltry) atoms you get on the SCORE board. 
---
Not all of the new challenges reward atoms, and some challenges lacked rewards (and some of them might simply be misplaced SCORE challenges, who knows) and some of them were removed from later iterations of the PTS, but there's likely to be more and new ways to get atoms besides just what you see on the game board and I think some folks need to stop freaking out and take a deep breath.
---
As far as what those challenges are, and what the rewards are this might be a bit spoiler-y but one 'set' of challenges are 'Kill 76 things' aka 76 arthropods/cryptids/insects/etc and there's about 7 of those and they'll reward 40 atoms each. (yay.) Then there's 'nuke challenges': Nuke Fissure Site Alpha/Beta/Gamma/etc and those reward ?? Atoms. (woo.) Some challenges are simple and straighforward but lack specified rewards: Take a camera picture of a turret/eyebot/scorchbeast/owlet/etc. Cure 7 addictions. Consume 76 pre-war foods. Revive 76 players. And so on.
---
I don't know if the folks who feel the trade-off between the new SCORE rewards and the dearth of daily/weekly atoms will 'appreciate' the (what's likely to be) several hundreds of atoms they can get from the (expected) new additions to the challenges menu but I think Bethesda is probably aware that players are still going to want atoms to get what THEY want and not just what they're given and I think they're likely to add some additional ways to get more atoms besides just the Season Pass thing. Maybe not enough to make everyone happy, but some, at least.
---
Congratulations!!!
---
Have an upvote. Wish I saw this the other day though, I've maxed out my budget on other shit, but I was really annoyed with how far apart I had to place corn. I could get around 7 to a tile -.-
---
It is currently not essential but will be essential in Season 3.
---
Played over 200hrs and only jus had this start a few days ago.
---
I was able to get a two shot and a second mutant slayer's fancy pistol.
---
Yeah, I switch things up too but these are the kind of issues I've had for a while. If they can't even be bothered to fix the end game weapons I'm not going to keep coming back.
---
I would be  happy if they fix it all the combat bugs I can stay a year on the same content wile they fix the bugs/shuttering/desync/enemies not losing health and a ton more.
---
I hope your right.
---
The fancy shotgun always comes with those effects. So you can just say the fancy shotgun. The fancy pistol gets a random 1 star.
---
Nope. Kill the limit
---
Fully clean water is not hard to do on a small scale -- FO3 indicates as much. The trouble is the filtration/distillation process is time and energy consuming. Hence why James sought out the GECK -- it was capable of the process in a far more efficient manner. So I don't think FO4 shits on FO3 in that regard. However, it does shit on FO3 because it basically says "Fuck the whole Lyons story arc."
---
Very true. I‚Äôd love unique things, even trivial stuff, at names locations locations. It would make it so much cooler. I know it exists to a degree, but a bigger emphasis on exploration, even as an end game thing just to encourage more stuff to do after quests, would be great. 
---
Also I entirely agree with your last point. I‚Äôve only been there once in my new character from when wastelanders dropped, and it was for that very mission and nothing else.
---

10c per crate. The rewards are just rng
---
Darn, I haven't done that yet, and might not get to it before Tuesday (got an annoying bug with the quest). Hopefully Bethesda will add an alternate option if the Observatory does close though.
---
Why are you running? Why are you running?
---
Part of the problem with any PvP mode in 76 is that it has to deal with the first major hurdle and stigma of it being a Fallout game.  Fallout made its entire name being a single-player RPG, so any multiplayer and especially PvP elements are going to be looked at with some hesitation because it's not something the series is known for, and your first experience with it will likely affirm that.
---
Survival was essentially a free-for-all, anything goes open-world PvP which is still very distinct and different from a more controlled deathmatch mode where you start with a specific set of weapons and loadouts.  That you could have drastically different equipment that is superior to somebody else made any hope of balance in Survival a pipe dream since it went by anarchy rules.  It was as hopeless and anarchic as GTA Online freemode PvP.  That has its appeal to some people, but I'm sure most that play don't care for it.
---
Nuclear Winter isn't really that much better in that department because the scope and possibilities are still very large, but there's still some luck involved, and that's probably more the symptom of the genre than Bethesda's handling of the situation themselves. 
---
That's why I think if Bethesda needs to scale down into things that are simpler to the point where they can control equipment and environments better.  A class-based TDM or CTF where you pick a loadout and class might work and function better than what we've had already, and it could very much play off the strengths of Fallout, since specialization is a thing people know very well from the series.
---
Yeah i get it.  I still enjoy the world a lot and its another one of those i have so much time and money invested i wana keep playing kinda things.
---
And randomly trade
---
the caps limit needs to go. this games economy is decentralized in such a way that there will always be price action on items no matter what happens. people will still try and sell ammo for 5 caps a round and people will still sell bloodied miniguns for 500 caps because they have no clue.
---
this game isnt like most mmos that have a central trade network that can be quickly effected by inflation. outside trade markets got hurt by dupes but thats because they were using 5.56 as a currency, and that not only got mega duped, but you can just print more at any tinkerbench. imagine having a currency you could just print at home and use. better to use the safe serverside currency, but 30k doesn't even have enough integers to differentiate value between high end items, its like having a Mercedes and the I.S.S be the same price.
---
all the caps cap did was make people reach for external markets, it certainly wasnt because they are better, its because caps arent worth the hassle of transferring between alts to even use. noone wants to play accountant 76.
---
people worry about prices getting too high, but they already are, and on top of that, unless you use those external markets there is almost no chance you will get to trade high end gear unless you just have a private connection which most people dont really have. even if you see a million cap price on a fixer or something, at least players that dont or cant use external markets would have a chance at buying it instead of it being trade for legacy only lol.
---
also prices can only rise to what people can pay, and the 10% would eliminate more and more money to slow inflation the larger transactions get. also, also, as more stuff comes back into the in game market, people will get more competitive and start under cutting trying to make that sale.
---
Vault Dwellers who watch r/Davie504 will know why I got excited when y saw this say Battle Bass
---
MrMattyPlays has become a Bethesda/FO76 hater. DO NOT watch his videos, he's totally biased. When The Outer Worlds was coming out he was all over saying it was going to be what Bethesda isn't able to do and he was proved wrong since it was a mediocre game, he's now doing the same thing with Cyberpunk (even though I think that game is actually going to be good). And is just generally shitting on FO76, recently he made a list grading games, he put FO76 on the doesn't exist to me grade. So yeah, if you like FO76 don't watch him, he sucks ass.
---
Earlier I tried to kill some ghouls at Whitespring after a nuke. I must've been late to the party, every ghoul in the golf club was standing around not doing anything, all invincible. Probably dead but not on my screen. *It just works.*
---
What a treasure trove!
---
CT gang!
---
Comment is in regards to "dont call it a battle pass" Its a time sink fuled by the fear-of-missing-out. I'm being a pouty ass, but that's what it is. A gimmick to involuntarily suck your time and attention by leveraging neat things that you wont be able to get in the future. Season experiences like this are aimed at curbing burnout but leveraging psychological addictions we naturally have against scarcity and our lust for vanity.
---
Wow , didn‚Äôt know. I grew up in Redding / Easton line and we used to bike to Monroe supermarket
---
But....you get to jump high...
---
And how we found, the same old fears...
---
Wait. how would that effect speed demon's negative effect?
---
Let's not forget is not a F2P game and we have a shady monthly subscirption trying to milk money from us, things are going to be even worse in future I suppose
---
100% agree..I‚Äôve got 1100 hours in and I still learn stuff from his videos...
---
I think your right about that.
---
Well it‚Äôs better than some simp giving money to a company to support a broken game.
---
I died to a bunch of lvl 68 at whitespring couse I was running faster than the render they just pop arround me and killed in like 2 secs
---
We should be getting Expeditions this year, sounds interesting!
---
But on the West Coast several early city-states/nations emerged from non-vaults, or from non-control vaults. Shady Sands came from Vault 15, which was not a control vault. Vault City came from a Vault that was intended to have a tiny power supply. The citizens of New Reno weren't part of a vault. The Shi came from a Chinese submarine that drifted ashore after the war. And the Shi were able to survive despite their proximity to the Mariposa outpost and all its super mutants.
---
I have my own criticism of seasons. But it is not a battle pass.
---
No, they can't damage you while just hitting you. Unless you go for a workshop (which I have already bought up) or are wanted, you take no damage at all? Not sure what point you're trying to make?
---
This would be immensely helpful! I play primarily for the event gear and plans, so this would give me a lot more direction in my searching. Any ETA on the Xbox side of your mule plans?
---
New area addition would make sense at some point. The fact that long term people who want to do and see everything and stick around for hundreds or levels are usually the ones paying/perpetuating the gameplay means it would warrant new content at some point, and a map add on would be cool in the future. 
---
I‚Äôve just hit level 170 in my second toon after coming back for wastelanders and I‚Äôm kinda stifled for content already. I do dailies etc but it feels more like a chore than gameplay even though I enjoy the game/stuff to do there‚Äôs only so much content for end game when you‚Äôve literally run out of missions and actual progression beyond inventing goals for yourself.
---
Yet the Assault Rifle is substantially weaker than the "antique" real world weapons like the handmade (otherwise known as a Kalashnikov). If it's a new design, it's complete garbage.
---
I doubt it based on precedent. Imagine everyone getting crabby if the drop a PA skin to 500 atoms when they were usually 1800 at launch.
---
Saw one flying near wayword today.
---
Wish I could find those servers.  I've been trying to level a new character and keep getting my ass handed to me by level 60 mobs (I'm level 30).
---
Can you tell me what those are please If you don‚Äôt mind? I keep up with info but I don‚Äôt recall seeing that. Thanks!
---
IIRC, it wasn‚Äôt intended to be free, but someone goofed.  (Also happened with the deathclaw topiary, and likely a few other items).
---
Once the goof was fixed, those that placed it could keep it, but you could not rebuilt it if you deleted it, etc.
---
Cant say I‚Äôve tried to spin mine recently.  Guess I‚Äôll have to try - see what happens.
---
I have no idea, was in Lucky Hole Mine
---
Protect the Brahmin at all costs, even at the cost of your own or Rudy's life.

You didnt mention that pre edit. There are often people on here confused as to why they got shot with pacifist on in a workshop
---
Hey everyone. Bandit666029 here. Everyone is welcome at my camp and all of the things I sell are never above 30 caps no matter how rare
---
TIL, thanks. Looks like I'll be changing sleek to another cushioned until some more mods get added.
---
I haven't went for it yet. Is the juice (t-65) worth the squeeze (bullion grinding)?
---
I would have gladly switched servers with you, but I also tend to be a sadist when leveling new characters,lol
---
I got it sorted. Was able to get a live chat going with a Sony rep and they were able to cancel the auto renew on both. Seems to have been a glitch with Sony, they had no answer for why I couldn‚Äôt see them on my end.
---
Thanks for the replies all!
---
I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting as well. You‚Äôd think we would have heard something by now.
---
Weird i thought the boss was an annilatratron
---
[WickedyChickady](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdilVsDTuT9p8ah1boHthzGL2REU2XKoZ) Has some great content and info on 76 but its mostly about Events.
---
This is kind of redundant of me but just for emphasis, I have a lot of time and money invested too. Watching the cons eat away at the pros has made me feel like I've wasted both. I'm just sick of simply trying to play being such a mine field of issues!
---
Just for another example: I can't log out at camp or my sloth might die when I log in, but I have to keep relogging when my allies quests breaks. Since the quest is at my camp I'm looking at a dozen load screens until I get fed up and quit.
---
I don't get the mindset of attacking people while they're at their camps anyway. Personally, if I'm in my camp I'm probably there to drop off my junk, or craft something, so I'm not prepared to fight anyone or anything. I've changed my perks to crafting and probably already stored all my junk, so it's not a fight that I'm likely to win when someone shows up there already kitted out for battle.  I suspect that this as well as wanting to destroy a build is the reasoning for these camp attacks, but it's really cowardice at the root. Attacking someone unaware, or showing up at their camp and being greeted as a friend to just start attacking someone is just pure cowardice.
---
There's not much detail on them yet, but they seem to be repeatable missions into instanced areas outside of the current map.
---
Probably has been said before, but yes, there are bugs. The annoying ones for me are not being able to fast travel, or the trade bug, or sometimes hitting enemies in vats, only to see their health go up. But I have been here since day one (not beta, but official release), and I have been playing almost every day. Long story short, even though there are bugs, I have never once thought about quitting. I just like the game to much. That, and there isn‚Äôt much else to play (that interests me) right now.
---
But my edit was before your reply so that's invalid üòÇ
---
100% this üëçüèª
---
That 15% less damage when blocking is especially useful if you enjoy shotguns, as it makes them actually work properly. I can‚Äôt even fathom what happened in the code to tie those two things together.
---
Get friends
---
Oh. Ok.
---
Thank you,gentle time traveller.could you also tell me who wins the next champions League?
---
Nope just as Ultra light. Also not seen them on the PTS server.
---
\+10% damage vs players. made for PVP. useless for PVE until they choose to make it work for human NPCs.. if they ever do
---
Ah cool thanks anyway, that‚Äôs good news.
---
That's nothing. My camp is built at a spawn point for random NPCs and twice now I've had Gramps spawn while he's already on my screen as my ally.

Aww man Monroe is beautiful! I'm from Norwalk CT, havent been back in a really long time but I miss it so much this time of year! Ugh, even a couple sentences has me drooling for Stew Leonard's Chocolate Milk :(((
---
Cost and ease to produce are very important. 
---
Also the U.S. military in real life ain't exactly perfect when it comes to choosing what to build. In terms of lore, during Operation Anchorage the Combat Rifle was standard, it was at some point after that conflict the Assault Rifle gained prominence. Like the 10mm Pistol is in many ways worse than a Western Revolver. 
---
It's also an iconic style to Fallout meaning the developers were under pressure to make it obtainable, if it's end game stuff then you would barely see the most iconic gear. Its like Iron Armor in Skyrim, it's the iconic stuff used in all the trailers and promotional material, but it's early game equipment that's soon surpassed. 
---
Finally there's the issue of balancing having absolutely no relation to lore. The Missile Launcher and Fat Man are worthless pieces of crap that kill the user more than enemies and are pretty much made obsolete by level 40 shortly after you first start seeing them. Bethesda just don't do balancing well.
---
Yep. Super annoying. Especially when it happens right before an event finishes. Like sbq fight. Only happened to me once. But using all that ammo on the sbq, only to not be able to loot the body, or anything else. Oh well
---
Ok, you are right, that‚Äôs pretty significant.
---
Is this even a thing or are you preemptively complaining about the possibility of there being NW related challenges?
---
Also true
---
Did your girlfriend put the cream on your Twinkie?
---
I don't even want the scrap kits in my inventory. Unless I am mistaken, it sends the scrap to your stash. I don't want scrap in my stash. Crappy repair kit's? I already drop improved repair kits because they have weight, and I have to many. Caps? I am at max caps more than half the time, with nothing to spend on most of the time.
---
They took our money and released a game in an alpha state.
---
I didn‚Äôt launch my own until I hit level 110. Felt good to go through it solo and launch one! Congrats
---
When is the next  double xp? I need to reach level 100 on NW again cause I lost my account
---
Been having issues with this since the beginning.
---
Find some good people to play with. I got bored around 7-800 hours then ran into a good group. Now I've got over 3,000 hours and still play almost every day. The grind does get stale after a while. If I don't have people on discord to chat with then I usually don't stay on that long anymore. Most of the time we event hop. I trade quite a bit and have a few groups I PvP with for fun.
---
Call it what you want, it's the same mechanic whether it's free or not. If a "pass" nuance offends your perception due to its lack of monetization, call it a Quarterly FOMO Time Sink.
---
I was born in Connecticut and have family all over the East Coast, but my dads side is from Texas/Arizona. I've been so fortunate to have been able to see the settings for every game in person besides West Virginia. Made my parents pass through Goodsprings on a trip to Vegas once when I was a little younger, its wild how accurate everything is.
---
I'm on PC and the respawn bug has been happening a lot more frequently. Quite frustrating.
---
That is a dang good question that we don't yet know the answer about.
---
What about the disease parasites?  
---
They are going to have to make a bunch of changes to various things.
---
I was in the beta too. The game was in a worse state then for sure, but I'm getting sick of putting up with all the bugs. They've slowly added up to a worse experience for me than I had back then. I've bought a lot of atoms, had first a few times.
---
I just get madder the more I think about how long my Gauss pistol has utterly sucked. Is it getting fixed? Because I have no idea, but IDK if I'll be around to find out, there are actually a ton of great games out now and everytime I have a blast in something else I'm reminded not every game is riddled with major gamebreaking issues.
---
Geezus baby gonna cry over any form of social interaction

Especially this game man. I like pvp

In pubg, cod, battle field, GTA, even rdr2(which is full of cheats but still better than this)
---
But this game is just full of cheats and ways to hack.
---
First experience with NW was getting killed by someone running across the top of the sky. I was like hmmm. Not for me.
---
You finished a huge chunk of the game! Congrats! I hope you enjoyed your journey around the wonderfully designed map and areas, and not too many bugs got in your way.
---
Welcome to the end game!
---
The reset timer for it is super fucked. It's been 3 weeks now since I was last able to do it
---
"Lightning spray gun" you mean a Tesla? Yeah they hit hard.
---
Turn on pacifist mode and never engage in PvP at your base.
---
I sincerely respect your argument, opinion, and the civil manner you presented them. I do not agree with them, however.
---
This is the "it's just cosmetic" scheme all over again. The goal is having us passively and unwittingly manipulate each other into spending to unlock things via FOMO, flexing, and impatience. I'm not saying Bethesda shouldn't be making any money(since it is literally the only thing that matters to any and all companies in any and all industries save for non-profits), I just want it to be recognized for what it is.
---
how many times were you thrown on your head as a child? How immature must you be to feel shameful for simply liking video games? It's not worse than people who are obsessed with cars, although I could argue the benefits of video games is far more valuable than an obsession with cars, but that would be too lengthy. 
---
Either you are a troll looking for attention (in which I am the fool for taking the bait). Or you are a sad little human who needs to look inside and fix the emotional and psychological wreck which is their life.
---
&gt;Cost and ease to produce are very important.
---
I don't think any automatic rifle is cheaper and easier to produce than a Kalash. Lol.
---
kev always saying trash about the game despite putting so many times in it
---
Vintage Nukashine is a hell of a drug.

I am aware of this now and don't plan on letting this happen again.

The many English.....

This is a camp in cranberry bog.
---
I wonder how many bushwookies are in a given game.
---
Speed demon mutation adds a boost in speed, but further speed increases do absolutely nothing. You can test this by using the Fixer, Wood armor, sleek mods, and so forth. None of them will provide speed increases as long as Speed demon is active. 
---
The Faster movement speed while aiming effect apparently has a minuscule effect on speed, if you want a tiny bonus.
---
Oh sorrry

Make atom shop items look like the game is Fortnite

Make most item so overpriced bezos would complain
---
Complain players don't pay supplement to a full price game after most features are barely available
---
Somehow
---
They need to hear this, they made a garbage game. People who don't deserve their jobs should be fired. This is the only way our society works, otherwise we will drown in incompetence at every turn. The game is terrible, their shareholders need to know, so whatever you can do to make a stink is good as long as you don't ruin it for people who are still having fun.
---
I like the grind, honestly. Sure, the vendor cap/scrip, etc, limits are stupid. But I still have fun.
---
I also have mules and inventory management becomes an end game in and of itself. I spend my time trading, outfitting newbs, and finding new ways to trigger some PvP.
---
Haha Fallout 75
---
I mow them all down with my b2525 gauss minigun. 
---
Please feel free to downvote.
---
The cap is 110. They tried to patch it out, but it bugged back to 110
---
I've gotten the rifle plan a few time from Robobrains.
---
Cool, thanks for clarifying. Appreciate it.
---
Also: working on 3 different toons with 3 different builds and trying to complete all of the quest content on all of them. This will take me awhile LOL
---
Thats all the endurance I've got.....
---
It‚Äôs a PvP effect, but it doesn‚Äôt generate enough bonus damage to be worth anything. It just sucks. If you have a really good roll with Assassins, maybe hold onto it for the proposed rebalance, but I wouldn‚Äôt use the weapon now.
---
I am not blaming the victim, there isn't a victim to be had in this particular case at all.
---
If someone has so little self control that they can't responsibly make a decision about things that are 100% not necessary the only way to protect those people is to not offer any options that require money at all.
---
What you are indirectly advocating is the removal of consumer choice due to some people not being able to responsibly make them to begin with.
---
I can't get behind that
---
Using the chainsaw more!
---
If it means that we get the Lobster trap helmet? Then yes.
---
I need it for my trapper armor.
---
I had 3 people swimming around me in one match. Was great fun till someone nuked us.
---
Yea I completely agree with you cause they only did it to do it. They didn't steal my junk or anything just purely wanted to destroy my camp.
---
I'm assuming they're all fairly rare ones that are missing? I doubt I currently have much of value, but I could putz around looking for those missing few when I play next!
---
I don‚Äôt have speed demon.
---
?!
---
You can use this style of naming to help with the lettering issue:
---
PA T-51 Nukashine
---
PA T-60 Elder
---
Etc etc. 
---
Also if you add a A to the PA so - APA T-51  it will appear at the top of the Apparel tabüëç
---
You get the fixer plan from the event, I‚Äôve gotten it more than a few times but it is a rare drop.
---
Surprise motha‚Äô fucka‚Äô!
---
I have only found this event 1 time in last month or so?
---
Yeah I've done Encryptid lots and never got the Fixer plan. I'm sure it'll drop eventually....
---
never understood "greedy." their DLC's are free man, the game is supposed to profit on atoms and purely atoms, now fallout 1st but still, you can earn thousands of free atoms, if you really don't like buying atoms just do challenges
---
You can go to recent players in game and join one of them.
---
A little late to the party but keep in mind that you'll need to use vats to do any real damage with shotguns. Vats eats up fusion cores so make sure to either stock up and/or take the appropriate perks (reduced weight/longer fusion core duration).
---
That would have earnt a Nuka grenade if I had one. Four kills with one grenade mmmhhhh yyeeaahh... I see I‚Äôm also getting downvoted because I like shooting fish in a barrel. Pretty much literally.
---
The event must be activated, it's not a random event like camp tales or path of enlightment
---
i know right? I have spent the last 3 years looking for that. If you like you can go check out my art on insta: manufacturedline
---
I think there's a way to do it if you remember a persons name who was on that server.
---
I know bud.  My xbox had 3 CTDs in 20 minutes yesterday and im so freaking fed up with every inventory UI being so laggy. yesteday i just shut it off and played hunt showdown and warcraft 3 reforged rest of the day.  There's so much about this game that i love but i hate it at the same time
---
If they aren't on your friends list they should still be on your recent list
---
Oh, I assumed you would. There is a soft cap on movement speed bonuses, adding up to roughly 20-25 percent additional speed. It renders a lot of perks useless and the like. I‚Äôd grab yourself the Speed Demon mutation, and not worry about speed ever again
---
I guess, Im new to the game. Just hit lvl 50 the other day.
---
Rolling this armor almost made me give up. Crafting at least two a day for almost a month. In all those pieces, I only got ONE usable piece. Unyielding powered Cavalier chest. I‚Äôm more of a sentinel guy, but I figured f*ck it, I‚Äôll go spend my 2.5k gold bullion on the jetpack mod and the dense mod. So I buy both, not ever thinking that you could only apply ONE of these mods at any given time. Totally my fault. I just thought that you could have dense and the jet pack on a chest piece. Nope. Oh well.
---
Seeing a lot of love for beserkers and not much for vampires, just thought I‚Äôd give my two cents. I run heavy gun vampires with full vanguards solar armor, my DR is 700 for both ballistic and energy with the armor plated backpack mod, on top of that the solar armor gives you health regen while in combat as long as you‚Äôre above %60 health and then stacked with a vampires heavy gun I never even see my health bar lower. When fighting the queen I can just stand in front of her while she and all the adds attack me and as long as I‚Äôm shooting her my health never budges, I‚Äôve long since given up on stimpaks, they‚Äôre not needed anymore, only downside is losing the DR by getting the tiniest amount of rads, but hopefully ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs rads‚Äù in the upcoming update will make the build much stronger
---
OP said they have no idea if it‚Äôs effected or not
---
Rare is being generous, it's ridiculous the amount of time that one has to invest for a single BP, oh well, I guess I'll keep on grinding.
---
You can always check the trading sub. The plan goes for about 10-15k. That event is so hit or miss.
---
Don't count on it.
---
Nice list.
---
I personally like Angry Turtle, Captainoob, Riflegaming, and Juicehead.
---
Juicehead for news
---
Angry Turtle and Captain for mechanics and builds
---
Rifle for general gameplay stuff.
---
Some people just want it there way or no way kind of like ‚Äúi have to have the last word ‚Äú.If you already know where the boxes are you dont have to stop the cows but they spawn in diff. areas so it is helpful to know you can slow down their progress to look. But like i said this is not your post so dont include any helpful tips ....what a Dick !!
---
I intend to do that when I get on and I don't really wanna ever pvp. Will having missile launchers and machine gun turrets trigger pvp?
---
Yeah i love pvp, before I played this game all I played is pvp in BF, CoD, CS, etc. When I get the games I skip the solo part and go directly online to play with others, those are fair and skill based. In this game it‚Äôs all about exploits it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point? I kill someone because I‚Äôm lucky to have this god roll and my aimbot happened to work as expected? And those clowns without any skill would tell others to ‚Äògit gud‚Äô. I interpret what they really say is ‚Äògit your mom to buy duped goods for you‚Äô lol
---
Ok, What do i need to do to activate it?
---
That is only to be revealed by the Mothman
---
Hahaha fucking hell this sub never stops complaining.
---
Specifically Where is this vendor?
---
tbh they should just let us scrip as much as we want but just have a cd on what we can spend. Basically how the gold system works.
---
That's a hard sell. 
---
An *awful* lot of complaining could have been mitigated by occasionally seeding old events with new plans.  Look at who's running what the least - throw a few 1%-5% drop plans in those rarely run events and watch them become popular suddenly.  Using the atom shop as the sole source new content probably wasn't a great business plan.
---
I'll certainly give it a try, thanks.
---
How bad is the hunger and thirst though because just the standard way it goes down annoys this shit out of me. Without fixer in hand, the sleek should speed me up but it doesn't.
---
Its bugged.
---
Thanks, it's a good guess for the strange behaviour of the naming process.
---
Oh i forgot about that. It would be also a great addition to it.
---
As bad as I want this I would prefer they put fishing in the game first
---
You aren't being forced to play any gamemodes.
---
It is different though. A battle pass you pay for the privilege to earn cosmetics. It‚Äôs an entry fee.
---
Don‚Äôt know if this has been said before, but you used to be able to have 4 star legendaries. Example: I had a 3 star furious swing speed agility machete, and then I added the sacrificial blade mod, then it appeared as a 4 star legendary. But that was over a year ago. They changed that in a patch that happened awhile ago. And if anyone thinks I‚Äôm b essing, I‚Äôm not.
---
Not true, I am trying to make something better for everyone here (you may disagree on my tactics), therefore not masturbatory. I know your quip sounds cool and leverages the word "whining" to infantilize my view but your statement is simply not true.
---
Probably all the people who like swimming there... lol.
---
Thank you, i will definitely add the PA at the beginning to help with the issue.
---
I'll leave the walkthrough [here ](https://youtu.be/klVnCkum0_I)
---
Or watch this
---
https://youtu.be/rwqQJgHjZgQ
---
I have a bloodied magic mini gun and it had shred him, I just died a few times because I ran out of Stimpacks.
---
What are you talking about? At what point am I defending seasons? I just said it‚Äôs not a battle pass. I don‚Äôt like the idea of seasons. My entire response is to OP implying you need to play nuclear winter to get rewards. You don‚Äôt. Did you mean to respond to someone else or a different thread?
---
You're not forced to play NW to progress, but there are challenges for NW, since there are people that enjoy it.
---
I‚Äôve had fun a few times with controlled pvp. I played with a really chill ass group one time but there was rules.
---
We engaged then ran across white springs and then acted as if we had started a team death match. 
---
But random pvp ends up being weird 25% of the time for me. Like dudes just tanking shots 20/25 to the head with a BE laser is not normal.
---
The sun is dummy common now sadly before it was only 2 I know of on PS4 i middlemaned a trade for one he traded the full legacy gp set laser set and flamer set for it
---
Yeah i was going to suggest it also but went with this.
---
omfg you guys are the most clueless community for any mmo game lmao
---
I‚Äôve probably done the event 15/20 times and gotten it 3 or 4 times. I once got it twice in a row!
---
Are mods allowed on games this? I've been a console person all my life and dont know anything about PC
---
I think everybody is a sad little human on the inside my friend. I am not a troll, deeply sincere. I have ASD, I think being into sports and/or cars is also childish.
---
They sure don‚Äôt stay there long if they‚Äôre on my server. I give it about 8 minutes so everyone who‚Äôs going to be there is already there. Then I go down myself and scope it out, makes sure I‚Äôm not wasting ammo/grenades and gauge the response appropriately. I‚Äôm surprised hiding there is *still* viable.
---
Not bad enough to constitute not using the mutation. Hunger and thirst is actually super easy to maintain in this game. I still have managed to run Rejuvenated characters with this mutation on without issues
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs a reference to private‚Äôs Gilbert and monroe from nv
---
Sounds good. If you want to join the discord. Feel free to DM me
---
He reminds me of rouge 9 from rainbow six, they both do analytics and and really gives everybody the meta,glitches and load outs.
---
When I looked my recent list only showed the players currently on my map.
---
I guess I mean childish in the sense that the current game keeps people very contained and appeals to egoism rather than creative problem solving.
---
Thank You
---
Lol. Dude!!! Just did this two days ago!!! Very sad.
---
Also from New Haven, hello!
---
Your luck is something I wish to have xD
---
Yes. My comment was posted 1 month ago. Now all the rare masks (from last year) are worthless.
---
Glad to help
---
I agree.  I hit my Max within minutes of getting on.  My stash is just filled with legendarys.
---
I'm on PS4 but have had the CTD problem a lot too. We get a general error code about data corruption or needing to update. I can't really say this definitely, maybe it was just their time and they had gotten a lot of use, but I've gone through two PS4s playing 76, currently on my third, and when I start getting that error the only fix has been to completely wipe my console back to factory default.
---
It's brutal, I've gone through so much crap and troubleshooting for this game.
---
I think I'm being downvoted so it looks like nobody is going to notice this post anyway. I give up.
---
Enjoy the game dude.
---
Think I was level 306 when I launched my first lol
---
I'm wondering if there will be a cap on how many times you can rank up in a day.
---
I want to downvote you and upvote you at the same time.
---
I have spare fixer plans if you have something to trade
---
If only it translated to the other events
---
Hey mate, are you trying to do it on a private server? If so, hop over to a public server and run it, then it should be available again on your private. I don't know why, but it won't let you run it on private without first doing it on a public server
---
It's a responder robot inside a build on the north-ish side of Grafton. There's big open doors leading into it and a responders sign out front.
---
I'm a person who is willing to buy cosmetics, and have done so in many games.   
---
But the prices need to be low enough that I will buy without thinking about it too much. And then, while I'm buying that, I'll see something else that I want, but don't have \*quite\* enough credit for... so I'll buy some. And, of course, the prices and the credit bundle amounts never match up, so I always buy a little more than I need... and am, next time, also left just a little shy of what I need for that additional thing I want.   
---
It's creating a hedonic treadmill. It's a standard tool for online shopping.   
---
But the prices in FO76 are almost all high enough to give me pause.   
---
And once I stop to think about it, I almost always decide it's not worth it.   
---
The prices are about 4x what they should be to get people to impulse buy.   
---
It's massively stupid.
---
This leaves you neutral... Overall you neither upvoted nor downvoted. I respect that.
---
Except the content in the atom shop is horrific ¬£20 for a power armour skin the same price as far harbour and Nike world for fallout 4. The pricing in 76 is outrageous and I would rather buy proper DLCs over shitty content ripped from fallout 4 or just looks worse than mods
---
Yes! I‚Äôm from CT and that moment had me in joy as well. Especially the brewery part (it‚Äôs basically a huge thing in CT now). Must have been talking about Voracious!
---
Ok I know what ur talking about there a dead guy on a hospital bed inside right?
---
I surprisingly don't get killed too often. But again I only play this gamemode when I want rewards that can be used in adventure mode.
---
What are you looking for?
---
Live in the Haven, from Stratford!
---
I built an outpost with multiple small buildings crammed with stuff on the inside but I wanted to build more stuff
---
Fair enough, but if you‚Äôre gonna hide down there make sure you pack a lever action rifle for the guy like me who comes and shoots at ya ;)
---
Bill‚Äôs is the shit!
---
And that was a stupid idea to begin with. I don't care how many smoothbrains downvote it whenever it's said: I would pay for dlc for the game, because that would mean it would actually be good. Supporting your game off whales means they have 0 incentive to actually fix it or make things appealing, and you can see the results of that clear as day. How many controversies has this game been in? How many updates have been downright pathetic? But it doesn't matter. Now, if every expansion had to be good enough to convince somebody to fork over $4.99 or $7.49 or whatever it ended up costing, they wouldn't allow such embarrassing issues as the various damage bugs to remain in the game for almost two years now. 
---
You can accept paying nothing, but you still get what you pay for. I'd rather actually get a good game. Right now it's a grindy, broken mess reminiscent in many ways of a f2p mobile game. I have never spent a dime in the atom shop because even now, after 19 major patches and almost two years out in the wild, this game is still in appalling condition and more broken than many betas I've played. There is no way to justify spending anything beyond the initial $60. I would feel disgusted with myself, since the instant I start buying overpriced atom shop crap to "support" the game, it's an admission that I am satisfied with the current state and approve of what has been done to it so far, and that is simply not true
---
Try some Tucks medicated pads. Might help with your itchy anus.
---
What do you have
---
A man of culture
---
Can confirm raider punk is findable at crater (he hangs out at the bottom of the staircase by Meg). I found him there before I recruited him so I dont think that's a requirement. I like the dialogue though
---
&gt;How many atoms have you bought? For the vast majority of players I'm willing to make a wager that the answer to that question is zero.
---
Pretty much.  That's not changing any time soon no matter how much they throttle free Atoms.  FO76 is missing far too many basic features and far too much content compared to other games of this type for Bethesda to be sticking their hand out for more cash.
---
Plus, even *IF* I was of a mind to spend money in the Atomic Shop, the item variety is pathetic.  Only a handful of items seem to get any attention and how many Pipboys, backpacks, emotes and Power Armor skins does someone really need?
---
Are you actually sure it's hacking? it's quite easy for geared people to down her quickly without using hacked weapons or the magic 200+ fire rate weapons and how much damage are you actually doing?
---
(Also, there aren't nearly enough options. There need to be far more outfits and hairstyles/facial hair options to really trigger impulse buying.)
---
I feel bad for making you feel bad if that's any consolation? I mean, when is comes to ridiculous we are already here talking about a game of all things. I really hope the people responsible lose their jobs so that better artists and game directors have the resources to make better things for all people to enjoy.
---
When my friends where still playing we did something like that. Either trolling by nuking a place and letting people show up than nuking it again to kill them. Or we would nuke in an area so we had a large nuke area to explore.
---
Yeah that's the one.
---
If there are adventure mode rewards in NW that I want, then yes, they are forcing me to play NW.
---
It's really not that difficult to understand. I'm not why some of you don't.
---
if that happens to me I just back out of the conversation, I go and speak to one or two other NPCs in the camp I turn around I go back to the subject and the dialogue completes, it's as though something doesn't allow them to receive the correct prompt.
---
I loved hearing Lou talk. His accent is perfect
---
Lol @ b essing. But this is truth.
---
And 500 skrip every day
---
Yea. Always got something to shoot with. I always spawn at the large chest (orange and purple chest) that always spawns close to the dam.
---
Just get a Gauss shotgun. Magic or not you'll be one shoting most things and probably never need a new weapon again.
---
I have a few heavy weapons with good prefixes, some are bloodied, one in particular however is a Furious Minigun with explosive bullets
---
Wait....I'm a Dick for sharing additional information that some may find useful?
---
Yes.
---
do 1000 dmg and u are fine, thats literally 10 shots for me.
---
I usually go for the pen (3-5 large crates and very few people spawn there, and when they do they fuckin run).
---
Im interested in bloodied and quad weapons
---
Most biased poll responses and straw poll format, it means nothing
---
It‚Äôs all about unfair advantage, that‚Äôs what drew most so called pvpers into this game when they can‚Äôt play real pvp games elsewhere. Get their parents to spend a hundred bucks on ebay so they can stand still or bunny hop like an idiot and not die, that‚Äôs what makes this game‚Äôs pvp mode a real shit show. NW with all of its imperfections and hacks are much closer to real fair PVP, which is why those ‚Äòpvpers‚Äô can‚Äôt participate.
---
I live a close to Bar Harbor, so having an entire Fo4 DLC was a treat. I‚Äôm just sad they didn‚Äôt do anything with Jackson Labs, cause giant mutated rats with human appendages growing off of them would have been terrifying.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to having one, I‚Äôm about halfway through ‚ÄúNeighborly‚Äù with Settlers. Until then, it‚Äôs my Pump shotty and an armor piece with ‚Äútake 15% less damage while blocking.‚Äù
---
TSE shotguns have been pretty lackluster since the TSE nerf in my opinion. I think shotguns need to have their spread reduced at close range.
---
Where is it? Ive searched the shop on 3 servers and I cant find an assaultron model.
---
I really dislike how whenever people suggest cool new cosmetics to add to the game they always suggest they add them to the atom store. 
---
It would be far more exciting and rewarding if more cool items were added into the game hidden away in random locations or as rewards for actually playing this game, rather than just being for money. 
---
Or at least adopt the warframe method where everything in the atom store is learnable and craft able entirely in game, rather than just a cash cow.
---
I like the click of your keyboard! Man this game is perfect for fishing.
---
For what it's worth, I've been seeing alot of this on PS4 lately, people leaving good plans in suitcases at stations or bags right outside of Vault 76. I usually skip it unless it's for gear I'm using on that character, but kudos to you people doing such awesome stuff for noobs!
---
Quad weapons you say, I have a Quad combat rifle with 15% faster reload and bashing damage, Quad tesla rifle with bashing damage, and a Quad gamma gun
---
this link keeps taking me to your user page
---
Thank you so much for this! I'm still working my way all around the encounters you mention, but great success so far!
---
Note to other looking to follow the route--not ALL spots have an easy fast travel point--sometimes you have to run a little down the road.
---
This isn't Quake 3 Arena or Unreal Tournament. PvP is an afterthought. Anyone who thinks otherwise hasn't played a Bethesda game. This is not a game about hardcore PvP, it's single-player co-op with the ability to shoot other people. Expecting anything more is naive. NW just took out legendaries to even the playing field a bit. It's nothing spectacular but a moderately refreshing change of pace to Adventure.
---
I also have a bloodied combat rifle with 50% Limb damage and +1 agility
---
I got lucky and found a person selling the fixer plans for 200 caps.
---
I just think you could've made the point in a much nicer way and people would be more receptive to what is actually a very good 1st point you made.  I really dislike when someone says something i agree with but says it in a really mean and negative way because it hurts the overall message.
---
I don't want anyone to lose their jobs.. i think the artists they have are pretty good.. i think the directors and higher ups are to blame..
---
My guy, W H A T
---
after you talk to the npc inside and start the event, you can just run down the hall and grab two off the bat and then run and grab the other two when they are walking later on, doesn't really add any time cuz you have to wait for them anyway. But not a big deal either way.
---
No not at all
---
I have gotten 3 fixer plans.  Every time I do that event I end up being 1 or sometimes all 3 of the pylon holders.
---
 Not sure if the game recognizes that, which I doubt it does, but in my case that's what happened when i received mine.
---
She is constantly staggered in every fight. See her head rearing up while she's being shot? That's her getting staggered.
---
Landing the queen is something I have done thousands of times because I understand how to do it. The Queen needs someone to land on because she needs to engage someone in melee combat. It's not hard to understand.
---
I know!
---
You really shouldn't talk about yourself like that.
---
Eh, bethesda has taken a very long time to fix simple/important things before. It wouldn't surprise me if one of the PR people simply couldn't get any info until then
---
True MVP
---
The guy probably didn't know it's value, or was feeling generous.
---
Thanks! I have the Fireman Helmet and the Fire Breather Helmet didn't know about the Responder Helmet! I'll have to try and get one. Thanks again.
---
I'm just glad that he managed to clear out all of those pesky molerats from VTU.
---
Would have been great if a few seconds later a deathclaw came busting through the trees after them!!!
---
Such a human concern. This nature is in the way of where I want to build my home, how do I destroy it? Maybe you should give it a hug dude did you ever think of that?
---
I‚Äôm sorry cuz I may or may not have shot him.
---
The person was hugely high level (500ish). And had lots of good stuff for cheap.
---
Can someone explain this magic shotgun effect in a little more depth? I've heard it mentioned several times now but I'm not really understanding what it is
---
That's honestly something I was hoping for.  Felt like a Jurassic Park moment waiting to happen.  Clever girl...
---
umm, please try that again.
---
Ah, makes sense then, hope to find a vendor like him soon xD
---
This is really cool. I forgot what game it was but I was able to go from my grandma's house to my elementary school.
---
Yeah I just saw a gun that was half cryo half Minigun on PC today,  the hackers are pulling off some crazy stuff lol.  The thing had a recon scope(which isn‚Äôt possible on either weapons) a stock cryo and a Minigun barrel and it took 5mm xD
---
It wasn't you, it was Patricia.
---
https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4 I learned what they were from this video despite the fact I was already using one.
---
Guilds would be fun. I'd look forward to get people on board with the post-apocaliptic mafia thing I got going
---
Likely hacked weapons made during a wave a few to several months ago.  They are handmade rifles with recon scopes, laser rifle splitters and some other things I'm sure.  They basically become fully automatic shotguns and can do obscene damage.
---
Theres also cryolators with minigun barrels that have higher range, rof, and clip size.  Broadsiders with minigun barrels that shoot orbital strikes, minigun with splitters, gatling plasma with splitters in addition to splitter barrels that look like a rave when shot.  Mini guns that shoot so many lasers that they basically just form a continuous stream of red the size of a car, and of course, the alien blaster rifle.
---
Handmade with a Beam Splitter. It‚Äôs hacked.
---
I eventually just paid the 15k caps for it. I never could get it from a drop.
---
Every video game is about instant gratification... I don't see the issue
---
No, the handmade to my knowledge has no recon scope,and the ones i mention have a weird rectangular muzzle brake, i checked and i have 47/47 mods available, is it a NW reward or something?.
---
Some dudes did it last week on a world I was on. Very coordinated and practised as they launched first nuke and as timer got towards zero launched the second. They obviously had magic weapons and experience as it was timed to perfection. The queen died like ten seconds before the second hit and spawned her again, and the third was already on its way the same. 
---
Was kinda cool to see and be part of.
---
Having them at your CAMP? No, they can't trigger PvP.
---
Lol I had a bad experience at beta with NW and never tried it again. 
---
I wish they‚Äôd just iron out some bugs and bring back survival. Just have a separate mode for the pvp community. I respect that there are real non cheating pvp players, it just sucks 25% or so seem to be cheating. I‚Äôm not food build I‚Äôve got amazing gear and I know for a fact I‚Äôve ran into my fair share of people who are using duped bobble heads, mags and stims. 
---
No body tanks 20 or so shots from a BE laser and isn‚Äôt spamming 60 or 70 duped super and bobbled up.
---
I hate hopping on to do the same dailies every day for rep for a chance at a gun roll I'll probably never get, but I do it anyway because I want it
---
Lmao that sounds incredible
---
Never really spawned there as I dont like the layout and didn't realise there was that many large crates.

It's probably a hacked weapon. I saw someone streaming the other day that had a weird mod on their handmade that I've never seen before... I had to rewind and pause and examine it before I realized it was the beam splitter for the laser rifle. Later he pulled out a Minigun that fired gamma rounds and had the deep dish attachment on it. Someone called him out on the chat, but the streamer just kept saying it was "modded". No, he was hacking.
---
Not sure where you're from but most online multiplayer game it takes time to get the gear you want. I takes time to level up to where you want.  It takes time to earn max faction of the faction you want. That to me is not instant gratification.
---
 Instant gratification is playing a 20 minutes battle royale game with the hopes of winning, just so you can do it all over again in another 20 minutes.
---
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm usually fully kitted out with marine armor and a handmade or an assault rifle by the time I leave.
---
If these are part of the season pass, they're the ones I'll spend atoms to skip.  Paying to NOT have to play a game is so dystopian, smh.
---
As someone from Pa it's always funny to hear everyone at Foundation talking about Hoagies and saying jawn.
---
Okay cool
---
 It would be awesome if they add new items to the game but i think that they are never going to add new items that palyers suggest to the game.
---
I don‚Äôt mind nw but I don‚Äôt play it because it bugs my daily atom challenges
---
Handmade with a beam splitter is a hacked weapon.
---
If only we had nuclear fallout in real life!
---
You can bait the queen away from people standing in dumb places. She actively seeks a target and place to land... If you can get her attention you can pull her away from the tents and she will target you and land.
---
when your game crashes it clears the recent list
---
I guess i am what you eat
---
Can I cross this name off my list or what?
---
Loyalty, does anyone in this goddamn place understand the concept?
---
I'm a level 3, so that Ultracite Gatling Laser plan is worth nearly nothing to me right now. But when I level up to the point where I can use it, I'll sure as hell set the world on fire with it
---
Days, takes some people weeks or months....
---
did they confirm future versions wont be buy in yet? as far as i know they didn't and until i get proven otherwise I'm going to assume the worst. Worst case scenario I got it right, best case they for once got me positively surprised.
---
At this point I'll probably never receive it from the event :'(
---
i thought most of their purpose was to fight scorch beasts to protect the rest of appalachia? im not to in to lore so i could be mistaken.
---
Hit up the glassed caverns with a higher lvl friend and set up the ultracite if you know what I mean. Took my friend from lvl 27-34 last night in about an hour with one leader one cranberry and a couple canned meat stews
---
No, the supply boxes from the upcoming season pass
---
It's not, which is why I'd personally rather they move away from it entirely, but if they must insist on it, then there are probably far more appealing alternatives than just jumping on whatever is the most popular at the moment like they did with Nuclear Winter.
---
That's even assuming they're interested in throwing any more time at PvP which I doubt.
---
I've had that happen to me a couple of times where I've arrived at my camp to find people there, and I wave and suddenly they've opened fire on me. I've had more fun out of PVP by not attacking back, and just running and jumping and avoiding the other person and letting them waste all of their ammo on me.
---
bc that's how shit works in this subreddit 
---
oh whyyy i dont have the rare mask? i only play 30min a day or log in at xx:59 to do some events whyy a rare mask has 5% chance bethesda? whyyyyy fk this game reeeee
---
Ah, gotcha. I hadn't heard/seen about those yet!
---
You also want to check that you can find all the vendors - although MOST people put all the vendors together, there are sometimes a hidden one for various reasons
---
It‚Äôs pretty good. Kill everything, take no damage
---
OP said the server crashed, not the game client.
---
I still have to grab Calibrated Shocks, but the helmet comes with all the helmet mods.
---
Mods are not supported by Bethesda, but not forbidden. Atleast the ones at Nexus. If something goes wrong and mods cause you problems they won't help you. That said, they won't cause any problems. People, including me, have been using mods since 2018.
---
Because those rewards are literally meaningless cosmetic stuff that you don't **need** in adventure mode. You wanting them doesn't mean they're **forcing** you to play NW. 
---
I want the PVP mounts in WoW but I don't like PVP. I'm not going to fucking whine that I'm being FORCED to play PVP because 
---
A. I'm not being forced because the mount is just a comsetic
---
B. Why should I get PVP rewards without playing PVP? That's a massive middle finger to the people that DO play PVP.
---
Think of the Fasnacht masks, some people did it every hour for 2 weeks and didn't get a Deathclaw mask.
---
That plan is rarer than that, so adjust your expectations I suppose :-)
---
Never buy ammo from any vendor, it's a rip off.
---
oh shut up you lil fan boy. if you want to bend over and take the bethesda dildo then go ahead. the rest of us refuse. it simply is not healthy for the game when devs nickle and dime the players for evey litlle thing. stop being a shill
---
That‚Äôs a great gun.  It may not be the best for the queen as she is almost immune to explosive damage.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not an awesome gun, congrats on the luck!
---
Same with the log cabin bundle and the seedy shed before that. Would rather have presets than floor, wall or roof pieces I‚Äôd have to figure out how to connect together. Plus Styles. I‚Äôd buy new haircuts, tattooes or face paint in a heartbeat but they never add to them. Could care less for PA skins .
---
well if the server crashed there would be no server for him to rejoin?
---
So cosmetics in adventure mode are "PVP rewards"? Whole lot of sense that makes.
---
 Pretty sure I saw some camp items as well which are not cosmetic.
---
Yes. They confirmed that. Go check their inside the vault 2 weeks ago I believe. They are all free to take part in.
---
[Edit: they clarified it may 20](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons)
---
spoken like a true blinded shill
---
Yeah, most if not all player vendors sell ammo a cap each.
---
Duping powerful weapons and armour leads to nerfing . Tse got nerfed and so did the Strangler Heart Power Armour
---
I‚Äôd imagine any open areas would be good but there‚Äôs always something scuttling in the grass being annoying,  I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy gunner so it‚Äôs real annoying.  Especially poisonous stuff.  Being able to see clearly in every direction was a huge plus.
---
i buy bc is cheap now for me, before in the beth launcher i bought maybe 2 times since beta and like the minumun pack xd
---
Best is relative. Between diminishing returns on armor ratings, and the innate % reductions that are the same for all PA, the difference isn‚Äôt nearly as big as the DR numbers would lead you to believe. 
---
It‚Äôs not to say they don‚Äôt have any effect- I did testing a long time ago and X-01 lasted 13% longer in a nuke zone than T-51b. But that‚Äôs about all I tested.
---
You have the discount from Duchess correct?  I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs intended for the hard bargain benefit to stack with the discount from Dutchess and the perk overrides the story benefit. 
---
I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs necessarily a bug, it may have been intended to prevent people from double dipping a bonus
---
He is mostly positive which can be refreshing sometimes, especially when you want to share a video with a friend to rope them into playing lmao
---
Exploit does not equal bug. I work in IT, you're going to find things not intended by devs in almost any piece of software, and unless they cause serious issues, can and will be overlooked.
---
Bethesda is aware of this issue, it's been a thing since day 1. Pretty sure it was a thing in Fo4 for manipulating where enemies spawn when they attacked settlements.
---
If they really cared about it and the repercussions of it, they would have moved on it.
---
I play FFXIV and the community is constantly beating the end game bosses with unintended strats, and even exploits sometimes. If it's something the dev team don't approve of they fix it, if they don't acre, they usually give us the thumbs up.
---
Toxic valley is full of it.  Doesnt get nuked very often though, so unless you are able to launch your own, you can either buy it (hard to find though) or monitor the nuke zones and do watoga.  
---
Equip GreenThumb before you start farming.
---
If you are lower level, (trying to get flux for calibrated shocks, for example), waiting until after the queen fight is over and just roaming the zone picking flux is a slightly safer alternative.
---
The closest chem bench is inside Watoga High - that could be an issue for lower levels - so fast travel may be your friend to get to a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù workbench.
---
As already suggested, agree with make sure you have enough to of the other components first.
---
OTOH, inert flux is considered an aid item, it is drinkable, and weighs less than purified water.
---
Oh. I think the only thing that bothers me is the lack of tradable items. There isn't much to trade in this game anymore.
---
They really don't accomplish much at all. They take up a great deal of your build budget and aren't very useful in the long run. I've been running my camp with 1 or 2 turrets for months and haven't had any significant problems with not having them. I sometimes will put a turret on the back of my building that has my fusion generator, and sometimes my water purifier. I also tend to move my camp around frequently, so where that turret goes is related to the enemy spawn points at my camps.
---
Yup. I do this when I drop a nuke on a public and everyone is staggering her so she won‚Äôt land.
---
&gt; totally avoid overpriced stuff like PA skins
---
Fuck this noise! 
---
As a casual player, the luxury of novelty is why I play games to begin with and if I wanted to save money I'd do it in real life and have it amount to something. Instead, I prefer to throw $10 at the screen to mix and match a couple awesome power armor skins for the whopping hour or two a day/week I play. I don't focus on quests as I randomly explore the world and hop from encounter to encounter occasionally doing an objective if nearby.
---
They cater to people like me which is nice, but it also doesn't affect your bank apparently, just your time, which is the opportunity cost of any game ecosystem that has a monetary incentive behind player retention.
---
To each their own!
---
not running blocker huh?
---
While I don't farm the event by any means I had done it maybe 30 times over like an 8 month period and never got the plan.  About 2 weeks ago I got to run it like 3 times in 2 days and ended up with the plan twice.  RNG is RNG.
---
you literally get a 2 minute warning, so yes you can
---
Idk if it's a visual glitch, but you've made 8 posts simultaneously about this. Thought you may like to know
---
I‚Äôm thinking robots....if your robot is destroyed it will be easy to rebuild again with only minor annoyance. I remember there was a perk for dogmeat (FO3) that was a litter of puppies so he could always be replaced. It just bothers me that the blood eagles can have attack dogs but I cant?
---
Fuckin word
---
but what if im overencumbered and cant fast travel
---
It‚Äôs not a visual glitch, they made one post then in another post changed the text so they are intentionally posting it
---
I love these comments. Any time some one suggest cross play I disagree because of the STDs the PC multiplayer has. They always respond with I have only seen one in my 200 levels. LOL, I love PC way more for anything but PVP.
---
Wow. Your quick. I dont have blocker. That's why I got the dodge
---
Yep, RNG is RNG.
---
WidgeonTV is great for Fallout story content.
---
Angry Turtle, Captain Noob, Rifle Gaming, Tyr - some of my favorites.
---
The caster has much better hip fire accuracy than the gatling gun.
---
I would love to do more companion missions with Weasel and Beckett.
---
If only Bethesda gave a shit.
---
There was plenty of time to respond, you spammed the subreddit like 10 times with it over the past 5 minutes
---
Yes, you're crazy, from buying it from her in the first place. Buy from player vending, usually 1:1
---
removing 45% of melee damage is worth more IMO.. especially for a melee build..
---
also travel agent and hacker could be swapped in.. those points could be used better...
---
-ETA: i would run adrenaline rather than dodgy
---
I like the cut of your jib sir
---
Out of fusion cores??
---
Nice post. I‚Äôve done some varied play throughs on this event and the rewards seem purely RNG and nothing to do with the four crates... which is kind of ironic as you would expect better rewards for more crates found. Either way, I enjoy this event üëçüèº
---
Mayby you just sell too much?
---
Build is trash like ur posting skills =)
---
How I spammed? There was a cooldown time.so I waited till i was able to post this one haha
---
I just don't *need* to get those items. At least won't stress about it. Play daily for fun when having time and relax. It's not worth worrying about, as grinding ranks would turn to job, and I'm here to relax my mind from one...
---
Haha thanks for letting me know.
---
Title instantly made me think of the meme

To me the director is the chief artist, obviously plenty of those guys are making fun visual art. The game designers are supposed to be artists of psychology and consciousness surfing. Obviously I'n not thinking everyone. Also, most of your life will be made of people not saying what you wanted to say the way you wanted to say it. I don't think being nice is always the nicest thing to do in the end. You can sound nice and be enabling the continued abuse pretty easily. Also, childish isn't a bad thing,m it is simply a flavor of thing. I just think this game has good childish elements where they belong, and a bunch where they don't. That being said there is an army of unemployed artists out there that could make so much more stuff if it didn't have to be tested for MMO gaming (think FO$ creaytion club). Like, I make 3D models and sculpts and find it super silly as an unemployed person to pay another artist for a skin I dont think is really that inspired - especially if it is only cosmetic. I also really don't like playing on a cloud of any kind. Why the fuck is Todd trying to watch me play? I don't want them knowing my choices all the time, it's creepy.
---
nice shit!
---
i also come to think that maybe we should stop using imgur and use google photos or flickr to have more options of quality
---
There already are daily NW challenges. My understanding is they are just adding score in addition to NW cards as a reward.
---
You need to remove the 7 other times you posted this... lol
---
It is little boring because crops go bad super fast and arent the best source of food and always you dont find animals to hunt.
---
The Lmg gets my vote for most fun in the game. All the heavies or at least most of them are a riot but that's the most fun I think
---
Theoretically getting all the crates increases your chances for better rewards, but I have yet to see the results. If getting all the crates does increase odds of better rewards, it‚Äôs probably by a small percentage.
---
I'd rather they remove the limit on Scrip altogether. It has been replaced as the top tier currency by the Bullion system and it is ridiculous that you are limited to so few rerolls of weapon and armor a day given how much RNG there is associated with Legendaries in this game.
---
Playing Terraria taught me my luck is horrid but at least there isn't a limit to how much money that con artist of a Goblin can take from me till I can roll Unreal on my Megashark.
---
I didnt spammed. How can I spam if there is a cooldown timer.
---
It does.  Currently downloading it, coincidentally enough.
---
Okay, I‚Äôll see if I can find them, they weren‚Äôt obvious to me
---
The hacked 50cal is making a resurgence on PC again right now, but plenty of people are also using the bugged weapons like you mentioned as well.
---
you can still spam the raider quest of the mireluks? that shit gives xp/caps if you don't mind repetitive chores prob best with melee buil... i didn't test it anymore xd
---
Never in the whole commonwealth have I felt a comment so much. You wouldn't think a Mr Fuzzy could bring a woman to tears but trust me, it can.
---
There are 9 posts on the subreddit all for the same topic.  How is that not spamming?  Just because you have a cool down timer doesn‚Äôt mean posting the exact same thing a minute later is not spam
---
Oh yeah I wasn't thinking about those because they just give you perk packs. So it will just be for reviving people  and taking photos and stuff
---
Yea where my camp is I don't usually have any issues with enemies I should really remove them when my camp is fixed.
---
Maybe you could explain why he is being forced to buy atoms then?
---
thats how you grind SBQs..
---
launch all the nukes 1 after the other.. server hop.. repeat...
---
Bugged weapons and hacked 50cals are pretty common at the queen fight right now.
---
Congratulations. I hate the way the armor looks, so I made it look like Liberty Prime lol.
---
CT squad turn up! Hollahhh
---
27,000 atoms = 270 USD Nice job my man!
---
Arena has special importance throughout all most popular bethesda¬¥s games. And in fo76 it have must been done from day 1.  Especially for those ones who want to PvP and have to satisfy their hunger killing innocent wastelanders and destroying their camps.
---
44 days of rolling to get a full set of 3\* Unyielding pieces for me. Three are excellent and I'm keeping, two I'm still rerolling more to try and get better effects. This is with 4 modules a day from the 150 scrip + dailies. A grind yes, but not a terrible one, and the resistances are phenomenal. No long running PA even in nuke zones as can manage the rads with radshield and radaway, have also farmed whitesprings a few times on a private server with friends using rad sponge and that worked perfectly well in a full set of SS armor. With this, a lead lines backpack and radshield I take only 11 rads a second in the nuke zone.
---
&gt;So cosmetics in adventure mode are "PVP rewards"? Whole lot of sense that makes.
---
????
---
A pvp mount in wow is used in "adventure mode" to show off that you did something in pvp and got a pvp centric reward. Exact same as nuclear winter rewards that are all cosmetic.
---
Do you guys not play **any** games other than Fallout 76?
---
Anyone that thinks they won't be selling them is kidding themselves. It will be just like repair kits. You can get them in the game or you can buy them.
---
Half of the ppl on tent roofs surely can fuck up the aggro, thats true. But im in stealth when im on a tent, and never got her aggro in the first place although doing juicy dmg.
---
I think his point was Bethesda could have easily cut off the ability to earn atoms in game, but they didn‚Äôt.
---
I cannot believe the Mothman cultists in that place managed to summon him. He must not care that much about the Interloper...we are right to fear the Mothman.
---
I want it so bad but the cheapskate in me won‚Äôt let me get it until it‚Äôs discounted.
---
It does not.  When I finally got it I saw the event was active right when I joined a server.  Fast traveled to it and the event completed roughly 5 seconds after I loaded in.  I contributed absolutely nothing to the event since I wasn't even there for it lol.  
---
I got the plan again 2 days later but I actually murdered the imposter that time.
---
I'm level 45 and have no idea what player vending is lol. Been playing solo this whole time
---
I main shotgun and tend to avoid making ammo since it's costly on plastic which I need to bulk stuff to sell to vendors, always been buying from dutchess *doh*
---
And many of those non-control vault civilizations would, if left on their own, have been wiped out by outside forces. Shady Sands was going to be wiped out by raiders/mutants if it weren't for the intervention of the Vault Dweller. Vault City made use of a GECK to create most of what they had, regardless of their tiny power supply. New Reno likely would have benefited from not being much of a target pre-war compared to most other locals, along with being protected by the mountains. It was one of the ideal spots really for making a new city/civilization, though it basically became the new city of sin. As for the Shi, the whole point of them coming from a Chinese submarine meant they had some serious tech backing them initially, and even into the future. They were also extremely isolationist which further protected them from outsiders.
---
You're giving a lot of very special situation examples that basically prove what I was saying. The region wasn't hit as hard as the East coast, and it had multiple Vaults within a relatively small area that had been given GECKs, control vault or not.
---
I have played dozens of mmos datingback to 2003.  Wow was far too childlike for me to have any interest in it.
---
Ah that makes sense
---
Then call it a quarterly fomo time sink, or call it Rodger, who cares.  "Battle Pass" is just the gimmick term Fortnub uses to name its participation mechanic. I do not disagree that it is not a battle pass, but it is identical in structure excepting the participation cost. You dont need to get hung up on what it's being called.
---
Destiny 2 has "Seasons" that have both paid and non paid routes. The two options are referred to synonymously as "the season pass". 
---
The fact is, the exact same framework has been implemented by at least two developers prior to Bethesda, so people are going to call it a "battle pass" because it is more akin to what has come before despite its lack of monetization.
---
But you dont have to call it that. I'm gonna call it a season pass, or a Quarterly FOMO Time Sink... maybe Rodger. Who gives a shit.
---
That‚Äôs a terrible argument.
---
Yeah, and it even two-shots a normal Scorch Beast in vats.
---
Mate you're gonna get banned if you continue spamming.
---
Or attached the script limits to script spending, like vendors do. So buying things from Mamma Mmmh will restore a portion of the script limit.
---
I think I'm going to use the vending machines as my treasure (junk) boxes now. Build a "vault" room with no doors or windows (or use a keypad door if you don't have anxiety), add vending machines to the "vault" but don't power them, add items to the vending machines and price them all at 30000 just to be safe. Then remove a wall when I need to access them, replace it when finished. I only really need two machines anyway for selling. Hmmm..... Basically a 60 slot (stackable) treasure box.
---
like the Holo disc I found at here on the Appalachia theyr purpose is to recover and gather any gear and information from pre-war stuff and fight the scotch, here on Appalachia they were called another name them became brotherhood (couldn't find this other name), they at first worked with all good factions but they became evil after a wile and started to hit the factions for supplies and old war tech
---
i dont debate with shills.
---
I love a good themed camp. Please tell me your ally is wearing the golfer outfit and a visor. You need your own personal caddy.
---
Get fallout 1st that‚Äôs what I did. It was 14$ and you get 1650 atoms right away I had a couple atoms already so I was able to get the camp bundle and the red rocket diner bundle. Plus you get all the other things that come with 1st like the ranger outfit
---
I would disagree as almost every camp I go to has a scrap box.
---
I think you are trying to talk about DTDgamer who posts a weekly Top 5 CAMP builds. There is no harm in showing off cool, user submitted CAMPs for that week‚Äôs top 5.
---
At the very least, all cool downs in the game need to be synchronized.
---
if you have made any unallowed changes to your INI files this may also happen.
---
Change the language to English, for some reason NW does not like different things...
---
I thought it was just the 33 VATs that's awesome will be checking them out
---
&gt; That's even assuming they're interested in throwing any more time at PvP which I doubt.
---
This should be your expectation rather than conclusion. You'll get a new mode before a revamp or nothing at all.
---
JuiceHead is the only Great 76 YouTuber. RifleGaming is a close second. OX is questionable at best. Kev just quit 76 is a mello dramatic YT lost. Innovsurv is reddit echo chamber. MATN does honest work with 76 but it's very little. SinisterHand is small time cool but 100% plays. GamerMomOver50 is worth a Visit Wholesome 76. No Mr. Matty, No Bellular news and No HellVsBabyFace, always takin the piss outta 76 never having played it and Yong is even less informed (not dedicated to 76 but never have anything good to say either)
---
That‚Äôs not how Season‚Äôs work. Each level of the season is based on s.c.or.e. Not specific challenges
---
fuck, you are right! ive changed some settings in the INI file. Can i delete them and f76 creates a new one?
---
Delete the Ini files doesnt work.
---
What are you using then cause I can do it in about 5 shots on a lvl 50 s beast
---
No! Take the scrip machine limit outtttttt!!!!!
---
There already b a scrip currency limit üòÄüßê
---
Being from the UK I cant relate however when I play Forza Horizon 4 I get a similar feeling
---
Man i literally almost fell asleep after 1 minute hearing his voice tone. I take your point as true nontheless,you even took the tine to post a link.
---
What possible issue could you even be pretending to have with the use of the acronym "NPC" for "Non-Player Character?"
---
My understanding is the existing NW daily challenges will now also award score. I don‚Äôt know why that is a bad thing though. You could do other things besides those challenges to earn score.
---
Recently I‚Äôve been watching AngryTurtle‚Äôs vids and some JuiceHead.  
---
  
---
Rifle is too clickbaity and gets way too far into defending himself and pushing his channel/insta than actually focusing on meaningful content.
---
I used to like Innov a lot but recently it seems like there‚Äôs a lot of attitude and resentment in how she speaks of the game to the point where it just doesn‚Äôt make for a good watch - and a lot of the content is usually recycled from other content creators
---
When did you actually feel like doing the story to get to that point? I just got past level 50 and feel like I'm nowhere close to getting to where I could launch a nuke. Heck, I just got Abbie's Bunker (free states I guess?) quest line given to me!
---
It‚Äôs a perspective.
---
-Angryturtle: for meta builds/weapons also he is fun
---
-Innov Survivalist: For daily/week news about the state of the game, she alerts you of some bugs or exploits, ways to do events in a efficient way, etc
---
-Norespaws: For builders, he knows a lot of build order tricks you can learn how to finally put all that stupid fences xd also he showcases most of the late atom store items
---
-Wickedychickady: She has good guides on how to get pioneers badges, complete challenges or find all those magazines
---
The rest are known... juicehead, riflegaming
---
On the map when you see people's camp with a green icon... It means they have active vending machines at their camps that you can use to buy things from. You don't need plans to build them, so you can set up a machine at your camp to sell off some of your unwanted ammo as well.
---
I don‚Äòt necessarily agree with it, but I also know that it‚Äôs a bit wonky.  I‚Äôm curious if the Dutchess discount works with grape mentats.
---
My understanding of Hard Bargain is that it‚Äôs the equivalent of extra Charisma points, but it‚Äôs not actually extra charisma.
---
edit: in further study, it‚Äôs not really extra CHA since the numbers don‚Äôt match up, it‚Äôs a different bonus depending on existing charisma
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hard\_Bargain](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hard_Bargain)
---
For example, at 3 charisma without hard bargain, prices for buying at 2.4, while with hard bargain it‚Äôs 1.96. A difference of .42. You don‚Äôt get a 1.96 buy price until you have CHA of around 11/12.
---
If you had a charisma of 11 and used hard bargain it‚Äôs 1.8, Which is only a .2 difference from the base of 2.
---
So my theory is that since the value of the perk can vary depending on how high your charisma is, they decided to override the benefit from Dutchess, but if your charisma is high enough, then you actually hurt yourself buying from her with hard bargain because there is a diminishing return.
---
I had to read this comment about 10 times before I got what you were saying lmao. Great dad joke
---
Agreed, I refuse to watch his content.
---
Its allright. Player vending is players have vending machines at there camps. where you can purchase unwanted items. Look at your map and find the circle that shows a players camp. When you look at it. You should get a little window next to it that will show you what a player has for sale and how much of each. Look for one that has a bunch of ammo and fast travel to it. Youll be looking for these vending machines somewhere in there camp. Some players will have vault boy cut outs pointing different directions. Follow them and it should lead you to a vending machine. if they are not selling it for 1cap each don‚Äôt buy it. 99% of people have ammo for dirt cheap.
---
Player Vendor = Green tents on you map.  When you scroll over a green tent a pop-up will appear to show what player has for sale (I.E. # of weapons, # of armor etc..) see Ammo section to see how much ammo they have for sale, though it doesn't tell you type(s) of ammo for sale.
---
To add to this. The mod replaces the sound file (on your computer) with a silent sound file. So, really just a mute effect for one sound source.

If you go to a public world, not private, you will see little round icons on your map. These are other players camps that have vendors. Look for one with a lot of ammo, go there and look in the vending machines. You should be able to find people selling shotgun shells for 1 cap pretty easily. All the in game vendors are ridiculously overpriced for ammo. Also, for shotgun shells, do Uranium Fever or other events with mole miners they always have a bunch on them.
---
Behemoth is a good idea. I always used scorch beasts since now, but the hideous hulks are maybe better. SB's have a very diffrent dmg calculation on ground and in the air. Or at least pretty whacky hitboxes when airborne.
---
After the legendary removal of the mask I pretty much gave up on the rep grind.  
---
I glitched raider rep on my two heavy weapons build for the guass mini and thats was that.  
---
Not worrying about the rep grind made the game fun again....well until ur basically fed up with the same dam events for the last 2 years almost.    Game is getting put on the shelf for now.    Season isn‚Äôt even that appealing cause guess what? We are doing the same dam events again...
---
My expectation is, and has always been disappointment no matter what. At least until the game sees an amazing turnaround with its feature problem that there's no longer a reason to be cynical.
---
Do you have a backpack?
---
Yea they all are super easy. Deploy camp 3 times, done in 10 seconds.
---
Yup this is good lobster
---
Of course!
---
So you can't.
---
Name an mmo that doesn't have pvp rewards?
---
hahaha I hear ya. The long and short of it, it is a data mine of an upcoming DLC story.
---
oh my god thanks so much
---
thanks
---
thank you
---
also, if it helps you figure out my vibe man, i literally take in more THC than what snoop dogg reports to intake everyday (I have i tiny little pink vape, I'm not cool, just facts) and I have pain that never ends. Bethesda made one of the few things in life that I kinda liked and then they killed it. As a person who didn't fit in and was picked on most of their life I don't want to be around people. It feels really fucked up to take one of my last places and turn it into another meaningless social club. Do normies not have enough of those? I just understand why Todd made a bunch of little Hitlers (who are trying to break his game) by disenfranchising already powerless artists. I sometimes wonder if the MMO style is easily optimised for data-mining resources and that's why these games are everywhere, maybe there's secondary sources of income for the developer/host (Beth/Amaz). I know I'm not normal but sheesh, it does amaze me that so many people think these are fun this way.
---
I tend to my rooftop garden and leave my produce by the stove for players to use.
---
Yea I know it will spoil eventually and I don't need to actually pick the stuff but I don't like a fully grown plant just sitting there.
---
You're right.
---
There is a very specific type of game I've been looking for to fill the hole left by another very specific game that stopped being a thing when ~~Activision Blizzard bought King~~ stuff happened ~~even though Paradise Bay wasn't bringing in the money from Candy Crush the whales were definitely funding its continued existence~~. So in looking for another game to fill the void, I have found a number stupid freemium games that are asking you to pay $20 for a week-long event. Mobile games are similar. You don't have enough gems in Merge Dragons to complete this three day event? buy this pack for $20! They don't ask you to pay in increments of dollars, they ask in increments of tens of dollars.
---
Most of them are in the little side passages where mole miners or mole rats tend to spawn. One or two crates can sometimes spawn in the side tunnel where you fight the raider leader. They can be tough to spot, but most have a dead Blue Ridge caravan member beside them.
---
Never go to a camp with junk on you... Or junk you're not willing to lose anyway. There's always a 1st tent at Scorched Earth these days... And if not it's only a hop skip and a jump to Watoga.
---
i dont mind a good trapped base..
---
its the ones that throw punji boards under you while your shopping that piss me off.. 
---
at least a properly trapped base is showing some creativity..
---
No item picture is annoying, especially when the item description is so long you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs arm or leg for sale..
---
I have an easy way to deal with em-
---
Set off all the traps in PA (Drop all junk\\store all junk first), it may result in angry MSG's, but worth it-
---
They get nothing, they have to rebuild-
---
i never shoot "friendly" dogs ever
---
My guild (for lack of a better term) has head canon ties to the BOS, so I stop by the graves outside Huntersville everyday to clean out the floaters and leave flowers.
---
I‚Äôd like to visit the plan mule! IGN: TooFunkToDrunction
---
Or just call it a season. Calling it a pass implies there is a... pass. 
---
Destiny‚Äôs season pass is $10. Fortnight, $10. COD, $10. 
---
Fo76, no pass. Paid option to speed up progression. It‚Äôs monetization but a different format than an entry pass. 
---
I don‚Äôt like it. But call it what it is. Likening it to a $10 season pass or battle pass simply isn‚Äôt accurate.
---
So essentially, poor coding from Bethesda makes some random combinations that shouldn't be related amplify everything in large magnitudes? ...
---
I think you just scrap them for one of the mods to drop, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
There is an automatic receiver for the Tesla... You can get it by scraping Tesla guns
---
me personally, I'd run a silo and put a nuke dead center on the camp. beyond that, I don't think there is much to be done.
---
It's a bug that I get occasionally. I usually have to relog to fix it. I've also had it without power armor. I'm not sure what causes it but weight and fusion cores aren't the cause. Seems to happen mostly at queen fights for me.
---
Yup durchs scrappen von tesla rifles
---
A N G R Y
---
Use light step and sneak when entering someone's camp. I question any camp that is not on solid ground as well.
---
Frankly, either removing the cooldown, or just making it so that its actually consistent based on days, not on when you scripped, would be ideal. The problem right now is that if you play at 8PM one day, scrip a bunch of stuff, then go to bed, the earliest you could do scripping again would be around 4PM the next day. Ideally, we'd see a scrip reset daily at a specific refresh time, along with an increase in daily scrip able to be obtained.
---
I use a Q3325. Yours should do around the same. Using all 3 shotgun dmg perks maxed here, skeet shooter on 3 and enforcer on 2. But there are also many other factors that could explain the diffrence.
---
You're welcome. FYI, Hard Bargain doesn't work with player vendors.
---
Yes exactly.   It's downright laughable that people are still trying to argue that "delayed content means better content." It is so obviously not true.
---
I disagree. They need to find a happy medium between the OP glitched effect and the useless nerf. Shotguns should be really powerful at close range but they should have a steep dropoff. Being able to one shot nearly every enemy in the game with a shotgun is a little much. But yeah, they better not go back to the way they were after the TSE nerf that basically made shotguns useless. And for the love of God, they need to fix the damage rubberbanding when you don't use vats.
---
Poor damage better running say Junkiesfor a larger boost ALL the time.
---
is there any evidence for that happening? if so looks like i\`m s\* out of luck i refuse to play nuclear winter for various reasons
---
Its a known problem https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/47343/~/connection-interrupted-due-to-modified-game-data---error-message---fallout-76
---
I love how both our comments on this are using statistics knowledge and get downvoted. Meanwhile the ones about Philosophy and just suffering from Confirmation Bias get to the top. It's such bullshit haha.
---
A year from launch I finally realize I'm a descendant of an ol coal miner from West Virginia. My great great grandma used to tell me stories about "back East" as she used to call it. I don't really remember much, or where she was from, but I do know my great great grandfather died from either being trapped in a mine or black lung. Pretty sure it was the former. 
---
Forever wish she was alive so I could ask her things about it lol 
---
Just waiting on a new, Western centered Fallout so I can see post nuclear Bakersfield in HD.
---
Ohh no, not the 5 steel 10 wood 10 copper repair bill againüòÇ
---
Cant wait to take on a hoard of flame floaters with a lead pipe!
---
Nice drop. If you run adrenaline and stack the furious buff you can get some decent damage on the SBQ.
---
just scrap teslas until you get it, I wouldn't be using the auto tesla if it wasn't for the quad ffr one I have, it melts most things
---
Basically it makes there be no spread while in VATS &amp; every pellet hits causing the damage to amplify to unintended numbers. Still had a downside, because when you‚Äôre out of action points you lose your powers.
---
Have a firing range in my camp as an ammo vendor
---
Wow I love that, I might start doing that myself! Also,  I'm a huge fan of the rooftop garden idea, I always build my camps in the Ash Heap and that's very Lewisburg so I might just have to steal it!
---
Random encounter Vendor Bot best spot is charleston station i believe
---
paid about 8k too much for that
---
Lol I have trouble enough shooting the unfriendly ones
---
To all my fellow CT folks in this thread: hello from Greenwich ;)
---
it's very rare i see them go for more than 8k. Even when people offer 10k the seller usually just wants 8k
---
I had just moved to the DC suburbs when I was introduced to fallout via fallout 3. The architecture of the subway is so close to real life (which makes sense because Bethesda is from Maryland and named for Bethesda, Maryland).
---
"Internal Server Error"
---
I think they try to transfer the game stability to their website, lol.
---
Why would they abandon a popular game mode? Specially when the player base on all game modes is so small?
---
Ah I misunderstood.  So basically score replaces atoms in challenges, and OP is worried you can't move forward if there's only a NW challenge to do?  Also where are you getting your info on how it works?  I thought they hadn't put it on pts.
---
Hello from New London, CT :)
---
In mother Russia you don‚Äôt force spawn moth man, mothman force spawns you
---
no, just eliminate the stupid caps limit.
---
Aye. i had the settler wanderer in my camp come and sit by the fire near the other settler wanderer. 
---
i was like 'SYNTHS!!!!!'
---
how many times are you going to make this thread?
---
Very solemn and respectful, I really dig that!
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to make so many
---
I would agree with that. Asking for it to be a viable build shouldn‚Äôt be too much to ask.
---
SECT in the house! :)
---
it gets removed for a reason.. and also.. you got your answer already last time...
---
No idea but they don‚Äôt seem to do anything with older content really so far. Biv‚Äôs place could‚Äôve been instanced and give a new quest to maybe find Lewis. They could‚Äôve added more Scout things. (It are mostly the tests that are annoying.)
---
They don‚Äôt even really seem to be in the business to fix really old bugs like the speed demon negative effects or claim tokens weighing 0.1. Also the new backpack mods don‚Äôt reduce carry weight while the fridge one still does? 
---
Old useless displays are still in the build menu, still not a singular display or outfit displays?
---
Players can still just kill my Brahmin!!
---
This would be fantastic. Unfortunately after certain recent-ish events, there is at least one of six parts of the map that I hate seeing in the distance. I don't want to go there anytime soon. Really just need a refresher and some, you know, fresh air away from the smog.
---
People have been doing that for quite a while. I've seen some people use a mule to place the platform while they fight with their main.
---
Ok thanks for the info. So it seems it's free with potential bonus for FO 1st in the future. Since it's themed I guess I'll mostly look to bother with doing more when the theme matters to me personally. But props to them for doing it this way.
---
I'm about 4 days of bullion grinding left before I can start working on my first chest piece. I know you can't sell or give away your SS rolls but I have read that you can scrip them. depending on what star level you get is scriping exchange about the same as everything else? What about how often less then 1 star sets pop up? Is it as bad as killing a 3 star legendary and having it drop a 1 star item consistently?
---
Anyone know if furious caps out on the benefit?
---
I know... The answer is no.  The crates only effect the amount of caps you get at the end.
---
I agree. I want more mothman stuff, more raider stuff. Don't give me pristine clean wall papers, I want my walls to look like jagged rusty metal. How about barbed wire, head on spikes, bodies on poles, giant skeletons of creatures long forgotten. A chandelier made of human bones please....
---
Have fun bud!
---
You can also assign it to the weapon wheel for quick access to. I do that for gas masks. Then it‚Äôs like poof ghillie suit
---
Jerseysghost is a good guy for stats
---
Totally bud! Aye definitely worth checking out. Have a good weekend captain!
---
Thank you.
---
I never carry junk when in browsing player vendors . Also haven‚Äôt tried this but I‚Äôve seen players suggest the light foot [ I believe that‚Äôs the perk not 100% sure on the name] but you won‚Äôt trigger floor based traps. I‚Äôve only found one trap base had no junk fell into a rad pit but I just turned off my console and restarted the game .
---
If the area uses PvP, they should not allow custom guns and give a selection of 3 random guns and 3 melee weapons to choose from and your perks have no effect and just fight to the death
---
I can't believe that right after you said that someone wanted exactly 8k, even when I originally offered more caps, are you a wizard perhaps?
---
rando spawn.. thats not regular
---
Rodger Pass
---
OP: you failed to mention Fallout 1st.  That‚Äôs a good chunk of month income that Bethesda earns.  People would likely rather pay $13 and get 1600 atoms then outright pay for atoms 
---
Considering how expensive the ATOM shop items are, the current system is fine as is.  Having no need for atoms (27,000 stored up for what?) shows that the shop isn‚Äôt really your focus.  For others, who haven‚Äôt grinded 1000 hours out of the game, the daily and weekly isn‚Äôt enough to buy the new bundles
---
I'd like to know price as well.  Rolled my first one yesterday.
---
Everyone's who's saying"woe is me crying about less atoms when I'm getting free stuff" first not everyone is going to get level 100 second if everyone can earn it it's not something I really want if it's in the shop and ive got 1400 caps and want a dope new PA skin that means I can buy one item from the atom shop per season I don't care about free rewards it's all about that limited shop skins.
---
This one was setup just like that. Went to look at a vendor, then all of a sudden I‚Äôm in a pit of death.
---
I mean if they had better Atom Shop stuff maybe people would be more inclined to buy Atoms and spend them. They need more weapons skins for ALL the weapons not just a few that people rarely use. They need more and better outfit variety. There is some good camp stuff sure, but maybe they should stop with the LIMITED TIME bullshit and stop cycling through the same stuff.
---
It has nothing to do with people getting "too many" free atoms, it's that there isn't much stuff WORTH spending RL money on after PAYING for the game itself. Not to mention how bad the bugs STILL are over a year and half since release, why would people want to support the game further after paying for it in the first place. If the game were worth supporting, then they would be getting more support. Bethesda has lied, cheated people, and done the bare minimum to keep the game going, no one has any obligation to support the game more than the purchase price.
---
Indeed. Someone came but and picked up all my 5mm ammo for sale, 18K rounds. Went to Harpers Ferry and dumped 15k in plans.
---
This. I saved garbage low level Unyielding pieces I found on my main and used them on my alt with a level 15 bloodied handmade that I found in a vendor. made leveling so much easier. Then you just go to a place like West Tek and stealth headshot everything. Also, don't write off the main quests or Wastelanders quests. Some of them are stupidly easy and give a ton of XP. Forget Rose and her fast travel all over the damn map quests but many of the others are contained to the forest.
---
Another tip i recently came across. if your low on caps. Take a melee weapon and run throw morgan town airport. Inside and out. The scorched are super low level but love to carry pump action shotguns and spare ammo. Each scorched with a shotgun will usually have between 4 to 8 shells on them. It take a few minutes to clean it out but i can get between 50 to 150 shotgun shells per run. Server hop a few times and it will give you at least some ammo. As well as scrapping the pump actions they drop will let you unlock mods if you don‚Äôt have all the mods for the pump action.
---
OMG I can't believe how dumb I was to be using dutchess, someone was just selling 600 shotgun shells for what would cost me quadruple that. 
---
If I craft a vending machine at my camp, can I use it to store excess crap I'm not going to use? My stash is full and it's hard to clear stuff out, or to know what is taking up so much space without multiplying things out. Dumping all the ammo and aid items I don't use in a vendor would probably free up some room if I can do that..
---
5k
---
I wish I had the time to do that last night. Would have felt great!
---
I just need to get to Rank 5 to try out that ammo converter. Anything else is pure bonus.
---
Man, should have thought of that. Although the spikes killed me really quick even in PA.
---
Wait you mean the T.A.R.D.I.S. in Fallout 1?
---
I feel like, they teased us with some atom shop emotes a while back.. sit, stay..then nothing..
---
as a PC player having anything to do with NW is probably the most frustrating experience in fallout 76 due to the sheer amount of hackers.
---
the mode itself can be fun, quite balanced even.
---
but hackers gunna hack, banners not banning :(
---
The promise was also that the Atom Shop would be purely cosmetic... And that was a bold-faced lie.
---
We only ever see the GECK from Vault City used, followed by Arroyo using Vault 13's after FO2.
---
Even if we assume the East Coast was hit stupidly hard (which, don't forget the Glow and the Boneyard in FO1) compared to the West Coast, the cities on the East Coast don't attempt to expand their influence. The only one that comes close is Tenpenny tower, and that's mostly just because they don't like Megaton. But the situation around Megaton and Tenpenny is quite calm compared to the situation on the DC mall. They could expand if they wanted to, but they don't.
---
Likewise, in FO4, the only settlements that expand are those created by the Lone Survivor him/herself. Diamond City and the Vault it trades with could easily set up a larger area between themselves, but never bother. The Institute never seems to much care about expanding its influence beyond meddling with Diamond City. The Nuka World raiders are possibly the only factions interested in setting up a larger system than what they currently have.
---
Build your own robots ala Automatron, and laugh when the Protectron legs do The Thing to try to catch up to you.
---
The whole game is a personal connection for me. A place that was about a mile away from where I grew up is in the game. My cousin's house is in the game, though it is way off of where it actually is.
---
Upvoted because you posted it here and didn‚Äôt spam the market with untradeable items. Also that‚Äôs a baller piece
---
exactly, a business who blames their consumers for "not paying for their products" is fking ridiculous, it's their job to create incentive for consumers to buy their products
---
Damn! That is genius!
---
Use the light footed perk.
---
People say Fallout has always had a weird sense of humor. Yes it has, but NOT that type of  "humor." Bethesda seems so very far out of touch with their Atom Shop releases it's really sad. Once in a while they come out with something cool, but it's rare.
---
If you're on xbox I have 6 cards left i can run em with you today to help get the plan. If yes just reply and I'll drop my gt
---
Yeah I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve never seen it in over like 900 hours,  just never thought about it,  I launch nukes with my main but do boss fights with my mule
---
Just clarifying, do you have 3 points in shotgunner?
---
If you spread them out 1 point in shotgunner, expert shotgunner, and master shotgunner will give you 10% more damage. I‚Äôm guessing you already know this but just making sure!
---
I play for a few hours daily and I can't leave a legendary drop no matter what it is I'm literally dropping stuff out me pockets and so over encumbered it's not even funny no limit should be on scrip if I've got time to play and get that many drops why punish me for it. At moment I get to max scrip and buy modules then max again and repeat but I hit scrip scrap limit as soon as I log in on a morning even give stuff away.
---
what system are you on ?
---
I just bought 800 shotgun shots, I should be OK for a while lol
---
I usually sell food I cook and weapons to make caps, never have less than 2000 at a time. I have most of the shotgun mods luckily enough.
---
I got a shotgun at level 25 that shoots an additional projectile, and does 167 damage + another 40% or so from perks. Haven't had to take it off yet 20 levels later, it one shots 99% of enemies I aim at in vats even if they're a good distance away lol
---
Oh nice, I have the same Tesla!
---
He‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm siding with the raiders. That Derrick Taylor at foundation saying he‚Äôs from Pittsburgh ‚Äúborn and bred‚Äù drives me up a wall. I may not live in the city but I‚Äôve never heard that accent from anyone in western PA.
---
I stopped playing because of it. It was all I wanted to do. So id come back once a day for a few days then stopped all together. Their whole plan backfired and instead of me coming back the next day made me not want to play.
---
Ask not for whom the Mothman cometh. He cometh for you.
---
Yea instigating shotgun is so nice
---
I like to PvP and kill people running hacked weapons at public events if that counts as moral reasons lol.
---
iirc its since the beginning that the queen tries to land near the one who aggroes her the most. if this player realizes it, he need to just move his a\*\* away from tents, bunkers and other buildings to let her land. she will follow you like a tethered puppy... its an experience you will like to make whilst in PA instead of normal armor, cause she will attack as soon as she has landed... or you just need to RUN ;)   
---
"he who aggroes the queen, needs a fast horse..."
---
Yo that's tight! It'd be cool if eventually we could have shooting targets as camp items that other players could "damage" without it counting as attacking a camp. Maybe a couple variants with different designs and Damage Resistances so we could test out weapons
---
FFXIV is my favorite comeback story considering SE literally had to remake the entire game, which you never see haha. So happy it paid off for them!
---
I'd throw Street Fighter V onto that list as well. It's definitely one of the most overlooked comeback stories. That game was the absolute butt of jokes in the fighting game community. Still has some netcode issues, even though Capcom made some updates earlier this year, but the perception of the game now is like night and day!
---
The humor and satire of the original games, as well as New Vegas and Even Fallout 3 and 4 is NOTHING like the random stuff in 76. It's like they are trying way to hard and it comes across as embarrassing and cringey. 76 is nothing like the mood of the other games, and it's bad. It's too the point they've killed the nostalgia for me.
---
Well done I managed it today too thought I was never going to protect them bots üòú
---
There are some who call me...'Tim'
---
Also, when it comes to niceness, I woulda' thought the game had taught you better already, or did you not play Far Harbor? Wear an upgraded NCR mask if you never wanna trust niceness ever again. See how my childishness here is driving a very real point home? that's how it's done (or something). Sometimes it is done other ways, don't get me wrong. I don't want those fired people to suffer, I just want them to get jobs they are competent at. I don't have an instinct for retribution, I find that whole thing frightening (one of the reasons I avoid people). It's just a senseless tragedy that incompetence is so widespread, it's destroying the world and also this little corner of it.
---
Ah that's it I've only got the 1 shotgun perk up at 3 skeet shooter 3 and enforcer 3
---
Good to know, thanks so much!
---
I havent counted them recently but I have over 100 white wolf fedoras and many mascot/ imposter outfits and have only got the fixer plan somewhere around 5 times.
---
Thank you very much for the gesture, but sadly I'm on ps4.
---
seems like the better approach would be to remove the limit, since all this extra inventory bogs the servers down, right right?
---
if they still feel the need to limit, why not limit what can be bought...
---
Yes, very rare though.  I‚Äôve got red hat before.  Was a roller coaster for my heart!
---
No, your vendor is tied to your stash. Vending machine is only to sell items. Go through each tab on your pipboy and stash box and sort by weight. There's some hidden weight in some of those tabs. Gun powder is an item most overlook, they're carrying lots of it, without realizing it.
---
Same. It's hard to swallow that expensive pill when I'm not sure on it.
---
Tim?! Could it be?... Sensei, is that you?
---
Yep, and cheap enough to not faze you if you make a mistake. Lol
---
Yeah that's what I ended up doing last time, I think I just need to sit there and multiply out the junk and ammo to see how much each takes up. I really don't have many weapons or armor in there so I'll have to play around today. 
---
BTW, is dutchess still the best place to sell stuff? Rather than waiting for someone to buy out of my machine
---
PlayStation.
---
I am from East Liverpool Ohio. Just across the river from West Virginia. I have actually been inside the world‚Äôs largest teapot. It used to be a consession stand a long time ago.

Pole hooks and meat hooks because I‚Äôm #FarHarbourGang
---
I thought the guitar sword was a stupid weapon now we have a battle bass?
---
Shotguns are bugged and do way more damage in VATS with ‚Äúmagic‚Äù legendary attributes. Your shotgun has 33% VATS hit chance, which is one of the magic attributes.
---
Just got to Ally yesterday myself! So glad to be done with stupid Ward sleeping in his stupid bunk bed missing his stupid boensaw haha.
---
Bought the shotgun plans, but haven't crafted one yet. Taking a little break from the game.
---
Shit No I didn't I feel like I should have done though lmao
---
The odds for true godrolls are so small they should remove the limit alltogether. It would also create a helluva flow of new weapons people could experiment builds and trade with.
---
I don't think it would ruin the economy or playability value, quite the opposite. People would feel better having slightly better chances to get the roll they want and would play more per day in order to get that roll
---
It looks like each pellet is doing the full damage instead of x% that it should be doing? For example, in one part of the video, without a magic shotgun, he hits for what looks like 10 damage, but as the number starts to fade out, you can see that its actually multiple 10s. With the magic guns, it appears as if the pellets are doing 100% of the shotguns total damage instead of x% (I dunno how many pellets it fires out, but say the shotgun is listed as 149 damage and fires 10 pellets, then it should be around 14 damage per pellet but the magic guns are doing 149 per pellet). Whatever it is, I finally understand why all those gauss shotgunners I see around are absolutely destroying things lol.
---
I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôd give a guess that you can find them in Allegheny asylum
---
Dude the whole fucking game is reused assets, and let‚Äôs not forget all the bullshit that happened when this game came out. They don‚Äôt need more money, they are a triple A company that royally fucked up their own game and completely disrespected their player base, the least they can do is give people that play the game everyday a way to earn cosmetics for free. Taking that away is greedy and retarted. Look at wastelanders, it‚Äôs a good update, but was it really worth almost 2 years of waiting(and all the new and old bugs along the way). No, no it was not, sorry sir but I don‚Äôt agree with you, not one bit. 
---
Also Bethesda broke their promise on cosmetic only items in the atom shop. 
---
Please don‚Äôt defend the market strategy‚Äôs for this game, support the devs, not the money men 
---
(Not a single dime of your purchases go to the devs or the games growth, it goes straight to the higher ups. Don‚Äôt be a sheep) 
---
ALSO DONT FORGET THAT THE GAME RELEASED FOR 60 AND THEN 2 WEEKS LATER WENT DOWN TO 40, completely screwing all the loyal first day fans.
---
Also $16 FOR FUCKING BLUE??? I rest my case
---
Whenever you're in the area it's usually a good thing to clear out the front of it... That Sentry Bot spawns as a legendary frequently.
---
I'm learning so much today I could do with a mentats  lol
---
I try to avoid looting and scrapping human bones. I also avoid scrapping teddy bears.
---
Will do. Ty
---
Have you tried changing ipresentinterval in the .ini?
---
19.99‚Ç¨ for Europe if somebody needs to know
---
I also enjoy a good trap base. Only been killed a few times. I rather enjoy it and give them props for creativity.
---
Well yes but I think drop rates for rare might be better
---
Yea I live in northern va now so I'm also not far from dc (45 mins or so)
---
I still haven't got the 200mm yet and I'm also at full rep for both  factions. Have high charisma &amp; perception
---
True, that was not the original point, but people kept saying he is relevant in 76, because his company is, as a defense to why he should be allowed on this subreddit, and that's wrong, because he's not a relevant 76 character.
---
People could just have said that he was not relevant as a 76 character, but that he is connected through older games and lore, so he can still be talked about, but they did not. They kept arguing that he was indeed a relevant character in 76.
---
That has been my point from the start. I have literally  mentioned that i can't say if someone is relevant enough to be on this subreddit, that's the mods job. My only problem, as said before, is simply that he is not relevant on the subreddit simply because of him being mentioned in 76, but there could easily be other reasons why he could be.
---
I rarely sell to vendors, but when I do, I usually sell: RadX (because it suppresses mutations, while diluted-RadX does not), grenades, mines, purified water, and any excess item(s) I accumulate. Don't keep junk "just to keep it", keep it only if you need/use it otherwise sell it.
---
I don't even know what that is.
---
At a guess I would say the crates may increase your odds of getting the rare patterns (like from say, 1% to 2% or something) but I really have no way of knowing. At any rate, if you're gonna be farming it, making an extra 50% in caps isn't a bad thing.
---
Hello from Enfield, CT!
---
So what is the conversion rate? Let me judge if it is worth it to me.
---
So after 1 in each you can put 3 points in bloody mess. Because bloody mess is a 15% multiplier on all damage and it is so satisfying to shotgun something and have it insta-gib like in the old doom games. Don‚Äôt forget the ultra important enforcer! scattershot and skeet shooter are pretty good too!
---
Its strange and probably purely coincidental but I play with two others regularly. And i could swear to you that we each have a predisposition for getting certain gun prefixes over and over. Almost like its account locked. 
---
One of us gets an absolute ton of bloodied, the other is mostly trouble shooters etc. 
---
I dont know if there is any way to check that out thru data mining. None of us tho seem to get the high radiation fluids. I get maybe one, to 8 or 9 of the other two items.
---
I have to try three times for Blackeye.
---
until you can use max level gear you should be swapping it out regularly.. whatever offers the most Damage and DR
---
make sure youre getting your daily max caps off vendors so when youre ready you can afford to just go buy some mediocre max level off a vendor..
---
then once your toon is lvl50+ you can start dialing in exactly what you want/need for your build
---
thats how I play it anyway.. YMMV
---
It's just going to ruin the game for people that like Nuclear Winter. They are going to have people like me rolling in not caring about winning or helping.
---
I had the 1 shotgunner fully loaded skeet shooter fully loaded and enforcer fully loaded bit as soon as you said this I checked (slapped my forehead in suprise lol ) and luckily I had 3 spare points to correct it
---
I had just posted about trap bases a few days ago. Know what this means then, time to go full Raider.
---
I'd forgotten how tough it was to level early on after I started an alt.  It felt like the character started picking up a lot of steam at 60+ though and the levels started flying.
---
Honestly the best route is to have a friend carry you.  They zone first to make the mobs spawn at a high level, and you spray stuff with some kind of high fire rate weapon to tag as many as possible to leach exp.
---
I did find a set of level 15 raider power armor that I blinged out that'll get passed to my alts from now on.  Even on a non-PA char it's super helpful for the early grind.
---
1. You do not have to directly hit Fissure site prime you only have to get really close to it.
---
2. Stay off the bunker! 
---
3. Stay off the fences!
---
4. Stay off the Trees!
---
5. Do not hit her with the cryo when she is in the air.
---
6. If she is just spraying her guano she is failing to acquire a valid target.
---
The AI for the queen will have her pick a target on the ground to attack before she will land
---
if she agros to a target she can't reach ie one that is above the ground she will not land. When she is in the air her resistances are at max.
---
It‚Äôs not like they slighted you by making there items expensive, maybe just don‚Äôt buy and move on ü§∑üèº
---
you would never have hit them anyway unless they are a moron...
---
And i will add here that maybe a fishnet like in one fo4 mod had. But the fo76 version eould collect fish and you need to cook it and eat. And if there would be a animation that your ally would go and feed the fish sometimes like in far harbor.
---
I know I made this post for the blue ridge price but apparently I clicked the wrong one
---
Sure, let's call everything i said irrelevant, because you can't argue with it. House is not a relevant 76 character, end of story.
---
I am not even saying he can't be on the subreddit, but that he can't be allowed simply because he's mentioned in 76, unless it's literally about the terminal where you find the info, or someone asking for me details.
---
It started as me simply saying that it was fair game to complain(tho it is weird to do so), since house was not a relevant character in 76, and then people said i was wrong because he was mentioned on a terminal.
---
I would not even be arguing, had people simply said he was not a relevant character in 76. I would gladly admit that i might have been wrong with it being valid to complain, but y'all kept saying house was a relevant 76 character, so i kept going.
---
you may have to back up your custom INI file, maybe to desktop. then once it is removed run a game repair by clicking "Scan and Repair"

Grognak Comics stuck at 9/10 although every single one is checked.
---
Just to add another.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs loads about I just don‚Äôt bother with anymore really because even with 1st I literally can‚Äôt hold anymore legendaries. I‚Äôve taken to ignoring/dumping/selling to NPC vendors anything less than 3 star already so I don‚Äôt actively go looking anymore. The scrip limit is far too low considering how much you can farm in endgame. You get three 3 stars to scrip in, and usually I get two back if I‚Äôm not saving them, so I never really clear enough to bother with hunting legendaries anymore that are rarely 3 star from random drops, as I can‚Äôt even clear the ones I have üòÅ
---
I‚Äôd rather there be something unique but  ultimately useless (I guess legendaries fit that in my example) than more of what I can get everywhere endlessly.
---
I try to keep a Responders themes with my character, so my melee weapon is an ax even though I have other one handed weapons that do more damage.
---
ill try to find the chart it was in another post
---
I'd rather pay Atoms to skip NW ones.
---
I mean, considering if you look at the Capital Wasteland, it truly is a wasteland. It was scorched and wrecked by nuclear fire with the amount of bombs that hit the Capital area. The only reason any amount of greenery was even starting to come back was thanks to Harold really. The water was utterly polluted, and having small, walled off towns was about all anyone could do to survive in any numbers, especially with the super mutants running rampant. As for the Boston area, it admittedly wasn't hit anywhere near as hard, and has a lot more plant life to show for it. There were quite a few more communities shown there, not just Diamond City, but many of them are still just barely scraping by or have been wiped out not long before such as the case of University Point and Quincy. Looking around the East Coast places, its mostly farmers and scavengers, with very few higher education capable individuals. We can't look at these places with a modern viewing glass really, because most of the people who would know how to manage and repair the bulk of the technology in the world would have either died or been inside vaults, or were very isolationist as time went on such as the Brotherhood. As a result, a lot of knowledge is lost, and humanity backslides hard into essentially being early agrarian culture with access to ever crumbling high-tech equipment.
---
Expansion and advancement would be as slow as we've seen, simply because they are too busy trying to make enough food to survive and keep their local safe enough to keep living when faced with threats like Yao Guai, Mirelurks, feral ghouls, super mutants, and so on. I will say though that I'm very curious to see throughout the future expansions to Fallout 76, or perhaps in the future in Fallout 5, 'why' we don't hear more about the West Virginia area in Fallout 3 or 4, considering the Vault 76 dwellers seem to be considered so capable of restoring the area along with the solid settler group at Foundation. Unless the Great Winter of 2130 ends up decimating most of what we're currently seeing in West Virginia? Hard to say at the moment. I would also say though that places in Diamond City and the Institute are likely smaller ingame than they would realistically be, simply due to engine and development restrictions. We could easily assume Diamond City alone to have 2-3x the amount of residents compared to what's ingame. Quite possible the same for Goodneighbor now that I think about it.
---
You just admitted to harassment by trying to follow someone to grief them. Imagine thinking you did nothing wrong. That's pretty sad.
---
Go to documents/my games/fallout76. There should be two .ini files in there. Open Fallout76Prefs with notepad and search for iPresentInterval. If it has =1 next to it, change to =0. Then exit and save. Also the game can't be running or it won't take effect
---
I don‚Äôt have one in adventure yet but they kick ass in NW
---
Guessing you are using skeet shooter as well? Shotguns as a whole are pretty inconsistent. The gauss shotgun is better than the others simply for the potential damage but shotguns are just lackluster overall in my opinion.
---
Insert Kevduit video here.
---
Brilliant! Got any other pics from other angles?
---
Ran into one myself in Whitesprings golf  course near my camp. Showed he had quite a few pieces for inventory. So I decided to cruise over. 3 of his vendors were beside each other, and the other was by its self in a corner with confetti on the floor. 
---
I thought nothing of it. Went through the 1st 3 then walked over to the 4th and as I did I fell through the confetti into a lower room where flame turrets got me. Me personally found it a great laugh. Trap camp owner was there. I turned on area chat and gave them kuddos for a great setup as it was one of the best I have seen yet and threw him a thumbs up. 
---
I have also ran into those similar to the 1 stated above. This trap camp owner had a blue print trap setup. Basically if anyone who sat in a particular chair, he would then bring a blue print up surrounding the chair with punji boards. That isn't too creative in my book when it comes to trap camps.
---
I have personally ran 2 styles myself. On my main account for awhile I ran a trap camp where people had to do the punji walk. Then if they did make it through, I had also placed flame turrets behind each vending machine. Kept this 1 up for a short time as this setup ate alot of camp budget up. I do run 1 currently on my lower toon build and all it has is punji boards. It's not hard to figure out when you open the door.
---
As you said, only thing that can be recommended is make sure you store your stuff. I have Fallout 1st so it's easy for me with the tent available, no so easy for those without it. I personally only cruise vendors when I am done with missions or what ever I was doing. Just go in with a junk free slate. Trap camps can be alot of fun as long as either party invilved aren't toxic, and thw owner actually puts work into their design.
---
There is only one daily quest available for Settlers, but you can also do the Photography daily quest (from Davenport, Overseer's Home - Sutton), selecting the picts from the Crater, and visit Ward at Settlers' camp, to give them to him instead of Davenport.   
---
It's also working the other way, getting picts of Settlers' camp and sell them to the Crater.
---
He spawns at random encounter spots. Same concept but different locations as tamable animals.
---
I don‚Äôt give a damn what other people were saying.  The rule of the sub is that the topic or subject of a post has to have a direct connection to Fallout 76. 
---
House has a direct connection to Fallout 76.
---
Everything else is either you being pedantic or getting baited.
---
I was incensed by his ‚Äúget good‚Äù comment... I felt a 8 minute nuke run would show how good I was...
---
Nuking player camps was literally an advertised feature during E3.
---
I don‚Äôt give a damn what other people were saying.  The rule of the sub is that the topic or subject of a post has to have a direct connection to Fallout 76.
---
It's part of the game, if you really wanna defend people that scam you may as well join them, lick my crusty asshole clean before I shower would ya?
---
They do stack, ofc
---
So what does this do exactly?
---
I marked the location on my map. Does it not show in the aiming screen when you nuke?
---
yes you should max all 3 for a total 60% damage increase..
---
max bloody mess also for another 15%
---
Why Teddy Bears? Just bc you like em? Or maybe so a fledgling wastelander might have a cuddly companion?
---
Maybe I haven't been playing the right games, but NW has the most hackers I've personally ever seen in an online game. They've done nothing to stop these people. Nothing. Why push people to play a game mode that is knowingly filled with hackers? Their lack of communication and transparency is asinine.
---
I do all 9 plus tank killer. The last 3 points are strictly up to you and what you want to do.
---
People telling me they‚Äôd never buy atoms and that they‚Äôve earned all the million ones they have is like something my little brother would say to me
---
Sure thing. Added
---
my PSN is the same as my username, feel free to shoot me an add.
---
I liked the plasma caster for ages, but I do regret going for it instantly because of nostalgia and excitement. I was already going heavy build and I rolled a furious faster firing one right out the gate so I stuck with it because of the relatively low ammo usage compared to the .50 cal I was using alongside it. 
---
But yeah I came to see it as pretty meh. Pretty inconsistent without buying at least the barrel mod, and the ammo weighed a lot. Much better stuff to use (I changed to bloodied ultracite Gatling laser for my everyday and queen use) and with power user I can literally carry 40k ammo for it at all times that weighs nothing. 
---
I can‚Äôt speak as to the shotgun but isn‚Äôt it getting nerfed/fixed so it will be a lot worse? I just got the Gauss mini gun unlocked I‚Äôm looking forward to rocking though.
---
Harassment? Nah, more like proving a point.
---
only morons dont check the location when the nuke notification is announced..
---
üôÑ
---
much more than that and also all my crops :(
---
That must be an awesome feeling! I feel bad for poor Gilbert, he's doing the best out of the situation. Most of the times I stumble upon his tent he's asleep. I leave a couple of stimpacks and some food and some clean water.
---
This is the way most games go. Interesting/quirky mechanics that require you to find a way around them eventually get targeted for removal because most people can't be bothered to learn how to play a game or include another step in their "workflow" of gaming. ESO went that way. It's a dramatically easy game now and shit tons of people play it. Zenimax/Bethesda make a ton of cash off its simplicity for the button mashing masses.
---
Well i agree, and an apology is in order, since you did not take part in the crazy debate. I simply did not check your name, and assumed you did. My bad.
---
In my defense, people kept saying he was relevant, and i'm not going to back down, even tho i know they misunderstood my comment. A little childish maybe, but i don't say sorry to someone acting arrogant as hell.(this is purely about those who kept saying he was a relevant part of 76, in an arrogant way, not you)
---
Geez, I need to move to a different state... Been looking at buying a house and they cost almost that much for half of the square footage, even at close to.an hour outside the nearest major city
---
That thing is called a pacifier, when the users suck they can get some satisfaction out of it.
---
They do stack. However, if you're trying to maximize your damage while only using 3 points, use lvl 1 in each of the rifleman cards
---
Every couple of days on Xbox, my buddies and I drop a ton of stuff outside Vault 76. New players are like ooh piece of candy, oohh piece of candy.
---
That's not the problem. Its following players. I don't care who gets nuked or for what reason. It's the intent of following someone that has no interest in being harassed.
---
I agree it's annoying, but not annoying enough to waste my own time.  That's just silly, imo.
---
It‚Äôs much more simple than that. 
---
Each rank of Hard Bargain acts like an invisible +3 Charisma bonus for the purposes of buying and selling prices only. 
---
That‚Äôs it. 
---
The value of the perk doesn‚Äôt change based on your Charisma. It is just a static hidden bonus.
---
That wiki is wonky. You can test it yourself with Unyielding gear and a large cost item like a serum recipe. 
---
Whether your Pip-Boy shows you a 25 due to the gear or a 16 along with Hard Bargain 3 equipped, a serum recipe will still cost 17,500. 
---
Base Value is 10,000. 
---
Try it with serums as well. Selling price will max our at Charisma 20, or 17 with HB1, or 14 with HB2, or 11 with HB3. 
---
Cha 20 gets you highest selling prices. 
---
Cha 25 gets you lowest buying prices.
---
With the right perks the gauss shotgun can destroy, it needs to be bloody/instigating or something, shotgun perks, and apparently the gun also stacks with explosive damage so if u put on demo expert it goes up even more, include bloody mess. That should make it pretty good.
---
they should just make a legendary perk for it..
---
also this thread is like a month old almost.. Im kind of over it and have moved on..
---
Just an FYI there is a workaround for the sludge lung bug. You need to already have another disease and THEN contract sludge lung. That will complete the challenge.
---
I was at 19/20 diseases for months until I learned this trick.
---
That's not the problem. It's following players. I don't care who gets nuked or for what reason. It's the intent of following someone that has no interest in being harassed. Please be civil.
---
It turns off the in-game vsync, which is garbage anyway. It can cause crashing and stuttering. If you need vsync you can still turn it on through your gpu settings

Only ever nuked a player camp once. I stupidly claimed hemlock holes on public and some dude contested it. I had fun fighting him over it a few times but he was geared for PvP with what seemed to be a bloodied explosive handmade so I was no match. I didn‚Äôt want to feel my resources were wasted so I solo nuke ran and target his base. 
---
He obviously logged off but then I got my workshop and my extractors/generators back. Felt petty but it‚Äôd not like I was salty or anything, I just found it funny to get a workaround of my own sort of PvP.
---
And over something so trivial.  Dude did nothing to him.
---
Can you find wild mothman?!?! I thought only events 
---
summoned him

A few weeks I got a surprise there, too.

8min nuke run is pretty solid

I will never shoot a fox or a cat. Rabbits, chickens, possums, and brahmin are a struggle for me too

Indeed, I will petty them until they stop.

Would say check your perk loadout because IMO the gauss shotgun is so OP Beth is prolly gonna nerf it

Small oof.

Captainoob does great weapon reviews. He‚Äôs pretty entertaining too. Light hearted but quality content

I suppose they burn down gas stations that sell gas 1 cent over average. No one has to buy anything. Nothing is guaranteed to be average or below average price. You want it, you buy it. You don't want it, you don't buy it. Don't harass people over it and continue with life.
---
Thank you for the tip. I knew I should have been doing something like that lol.

Have you tried disabling vsync?

Obviously you're broke and unemployed because you don't know how jobs work.

Exactly the same for me.

What is your build? I‚Äôll craft you a set of heavy BOS combat armor and a decent weapon with good attachments
---
Just posted a long ass rant about this. It may be my final straw. 
---
They keep taking things away fro. Their player base. Didnt rhey just modify challenges so some werent so hard so more people would do them?
---
Its a hugeeee reduction on an already slow grind. And im tired of everything being a boring grind. 
---
If you look at the seasons rewards theyve also locked the good items spaced far enough apart that youre forced to invest hundreds of hours into getting them, while collecting crap rewards like scrap kits in between. 
---
Just another grind while taking away something fun we had. Nope.
---
It‚Äôs a wonderful thing. My entire FO76 experience has been using this exploit, I have no idea what I‚Äôd do if they took it away. Lol.
---
I bet its called a pacifier because the ones using it are toddlers with no skill,and they overcompensate for something else.
---
Why stalk them because prices too high? Just don‚Äôt buy and move on. It‚Äôs not like anyone in their right mind is going to pay over the odds for anything is it? Lol I best have a check of my vendor in case anything is over the odds üòÇ
---
Yea I get it, but you're also screwing over that innocent player vendor by tying up his machine.  Now he's making no sales because a 3rd party did a minor annoying thing to you.
---
I‚Äôd get it if I could transfer my characters.
---
I understand the nuke a queen repeatedly system, done it myself. Theses nuke launches are literally within seconds of each other and hitting the same spot. There's no regen time in between them just three booms. The Harpers Ferry one had all three hit the ground at the same time.....so surprised it didn't crash the server.
---
I'm going for a more single shot rifle/ sniper build.  And I will add you thanks.
---
Try changing your language to English that‚Äôs what fixed it for me (I‚Äôm german too)
---
But also would like a good auto rifle as well
---
Pay for Season Passes?
---
I just ignore.
---
I'm 99% certain thats what hit my SBQ fight, they lit up the non irradiated fight zone like a christmas tree, lol. Fine by me but the noobs ran for their lives.
---
Well, it turned into a pissing contest when they told me to ‚Äúget good‚Äù.
---
This happens because they are only listening to the loud crying babies out there in the wasteland üòÇ most old active vets dont even play anymore because they only try to fix something by making it worse or just taking it out of the game before trying to fix it üòÇ
---
Not everyone can do that, I don't have god-rolls or use bloodied.
---
You won‚Äôt need to buy any of the seasons, Bethesda has come out and said they will be free content. You can skip levels after 2 weeks for 150 atoms per level.
---
with VATS currently broken the build is already obsolete
---
The only viable shotgun now for any of the various shotgun builds is the gauss shotgun and I am 100% it is going to get nerfed due to its using perks and features that it is not supposed to.
---
The Gauss shotgun is an energy weapon that is using energy weapon perks and ballistic weapon perks, but neither one exclusively and some it probably should and some it probably shouldn't.
---
In your settings&gt;game settings there is an option to enable pacifist mode.
---
Pacifist is just that, won't cause you to enable pvp or recieve pvp actions. I dont think it lets you hunt wanted players though, and im not sure about events like monster mash and hunter/hunted
---
LMAO you honestly think that giving them money is equivalent to a game being made well? Boy oh boy kiddo are you lost. Look at battlefront 2, completely overhauled the game, FOR FREE because they know they fucked up in the beginning, it should be the same here, except Beth is a greedy whore with shitty programmers working off an ancient engine. Dude the money u give them, any money, DOES NOT GO INTO THE GAMES GROWTH, IT NEVER HAS, the devs are going to be doing the same work for the same pay regardless, any extra money accrued goes to the higher ups, period. You can pay for dlc if you want but don‚Äôt expect anything different from what your getting now
---
I think Seasons is a kick in the balls. 100-200 hours of grind in a 3 month span. I‚Äôve loved the game since launch and I play 3-4 times a week in 3-4 hour bursts. I feel that unless I fork over $60+, I‚Äôll never reach Rank 100 to get some of those cool cosmetics. Even grinding the atoms is becoming a slog like you have just described.
---
It's like, getting shot right after the SBQ dies......so what, move on. It's not worth the ammo.

currently to play the seasons, they are free. 100% free for the first one from what bethesda says. but unsure about future ones.
---
Same... It makes me so unhappy with that.
---
That was my thought at the time, too - the PR people probably saw it right away, panicked, and *wanted* to say something, but they needed it to get cleared by legal or whoever else to ensure it was accurate.
---
Not being able to earn enough free premium currency to buy shit you want? Cry me a River. 
---
And scrap and xp boosts are P2W? In a non competitive game lololol. Hilarious. 
---
Also, the season pass system isnt designed so every casual player can complete it. I won't be able to. Nor will I buy ranks. 
---
I however don't cry about what I do and don't get for free. Because it's free. I'm not an entitled, spoiled little child.

Don‚Äôt church it up dirt. Shotguns are broken, but they should have that much stopping power.

Can you change the legendary mods on them? Or do you have to craft a new one?

if you were to spend real world money to buy atom shop points to purchase all the atom shop items, you would have spent close to $1000 by now. thats all i have to say.

No - please do! I know where the bulk of them spawn in Flatwoods and it usually makes for ~2-3 free kills' worth of XP every match. (My personal record was 7 AFKers in one spawn location.)

You can't say it takes 100s of hours if it's not even out. Stop being. Young yea

Bethesda have said All seasons are free as the initial announcement was so poorly worded.

Why? If you can get them in game for free then don‚Äôt buy them. If people wanna buy them then buy them. Who cares? I never understood why people get all crabby about these things. They‚Äôre useful items but not so much as they need to be purchased to succeed in the game.
---
If not this at least let us have traveling pet companions that can help us fight like dogmeat.
---
That's interesting, I still think it's bad coding can't imagine that this type of legendary mods were meant to do such hahahaha. Thank you for educating me!
---
Throw in a Bucket of Fish Stashbox, and I'd insta-buy
---
I fail to understand how being given what they want to give me is somehow better than me getting atoms to buy what I want.. baffling to me
---
Oh, I think he has a degree of relevance. Just not as much as an ‚Äòon-stage‚Äô character or one that has a lot of references and mentions. 
---
Scale of 1-100?  He‚Äôs maybe a 5. Overseer is pretty much a 25 pre Wastelanders/75 post Wastelanders. Meg and Paige are about 80. The actual raid participants like Gail or Ra-Ra or Jen are 90+. The player is 100. 
---
It ain‚Äôt *how* relevant he is that matters. Just that he *is* relevant (which you previously admitted) and/or he has a direct connection to the game (which he does). 
---
It passes all the tests needed to be a legitimate post topic here. 
---
Which means any complaints based on ‚Äòit breaks the sub‚Äôs rules‚Äô are invalid. Which means your defend of them citing them as valid was wrong. 
---
Dots connected. Have a good day.
---
Excavator gets a carry bonus?!? *drops t65 gear*
---
A lot of people bought into the Fallout 1st membership despite how much its been vilified. I think that's where they get most of their income. I see tents all over the place and most camps I visit have a scrap box. I subscribe every few months and cancel just to top off my scrap box.
---
It just runs like shit
---
Thats a good idea. Idk if its little hard to see but who cares.
---
Thanks.  I read this but didn't really absorb that you would not be able to skip specific challenges.  Now it just sounds like moving the same old challenges (which suck) to unlock Score instead of Atoms, which could be more or less atoms for the effort, depending on how generous they are.  Hopefully you can earn enough score to keep up without needing to play NW, otherwise it will be basically as I described it: Using the atoms you earn to keep up with where you would be if you had bothered or paying to  "skip" the NW challenges.
---
People already do that in other games.  "There's 48 hrs left on this season, but I didn't do X and now there isn't time, so I guess I'll pay to finish it up."
---
Maybe, I use a pump shotty almost exclusively so I‚Äôd argue it is viable, and I hold my own in the tougher events like encrypted and scorched.
---
Who is crying for this?
---
I loved this game. I still played daily, thru all of the bugs and crashes. 
---
Its just absolutely insulting at this point honestly. 
---
Any benefit or bit of fun we had is just taken away.
---
derp
---
Yep, +100kg
---
They said it themselves lol
---
Well, your understanding is mostly right, save for missing one critical element - with the current system, we get Atoms from challenges, that we can then go spend on whatever we want. But with SCORE, we'll only be able to get the rewards offered by the season, and only by unlocking them in rank order, no less - if I were to decide I want the fireplace secret door, I'd have to grind all the way out to rank 99, even if I have no interest in, and will never use, *any* of the other content before it.
---
We might be getting more "stuff", but we're losing the *choice* of *what* stuff.
---
Oh, I already know it's free. ;)
---
when I am in flow state I don't have a sense for this, which is why I like immersion. The MMO platform is an immersion killer. Like I just get a wave of shame after 14 hours of nonstop gaming and then I pass out. My other option is to spend my days in endless existential dread and OCD so, you know
---
His lore videos are questionable sometimes with his personal opinion being inserted as fact. Or perhaps misinterpreted that way, I guess I always thought he was pretty clear when he was just ruminating on an idea.
---
However, some things about him as a person are...problematic. Really depends on if you care or not, but it's reasonable to do so.
---
He's homophobic. He's a hypocrite: He thinks people should be 'above' animal urges and drug use is stupid but whoops he drinks and smokes. He recorded a young woman who was overweight and giggled about her weight while he himself is, you know, also overweight. He wrote a "Manlyfesto" where it's not 'manly' to jerk off but he regularly uses sex mods and has gotten caught with them in his clips a couple times, his argument is that suddenly porn is okay for a man to use if he's in a relationship which is a really stupid workaround to "it's okay if I do it but you can't because reasons."
---
If you like his stuff, great, awesome. But I always got a weird feeling that something was off about him and when I looked into it I just...was kinda done with him.
---
[Here's 40 minutes of stuff.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9wxYvypl80&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yep exactly. I dont want icons and scrap kits. I want to earn my own atoms and buy the items that interest me. 
---
Alllll this is is a way ro force you to pay cash for atoms for things in the atom shop. Since you will no longer be able to earn enough to buy a full bundle a month most months now. Its a money grubbing scam.
---
It is one of the only things I have ever paid for in the Atom Shop at full price. 
---
For CAMP builders looking for non-"junky" options, it really can't be beat. It's a wood set that doesn't look like an old shack, or come with only busted windows as an option (like the Barn set). I was tired of all of my CAMPS either looking like 1950s brownstones (brick), or metal bunkers.
---
It's also the only way to get the porch, which is a really nice touch for "home-y" looking houses.
---
I know people look at the price and say "lol - you paid $14 for that?" But in reality if you've earned the Atoms through play you've paid nothing for it, and for the low price of "nothing" it adds a really nice build option to your CAMP.
---
I've been using the Gauss Shotgun for several weeks now with all of the Shotgunner perks and the Skeet Shooter perk loaded, all of which are maxed out, and in my experience, the Gauss Shotgun is amazing in terms of grouping, range and power.
---
if anybody puts weight into reddit karma, they probably arent good people anyways. i wouldnt associate with those people in person or digitally.
---
I mean hackers managed to figure out how to spawn in weapons with any legendary affects on them that they wanted, so bethesda *should* be able to as well...
---
Mr. House Birthday bundle in the Atom Shop. Get it while it lasts, for a limited time only !
---
Yes, because Bethesda has to rely on family connections to snag an editorial. 
---
Lots of unrelated people have the same last name. This isn't star wars.
---
Hunter long coat worth 30k my dear
---
I am actually more embarrassed for other people than myself. Like if anybody has to be on a stage being a fool, I always prefer it be me. I'm somehow more sensitive to shame secondhand.
---
Crafters a half dozen. The best of the bunch was Bloodied with less VATs cost. Didn't bother trying out the two medics and exterminator. Instigator did less damage than bloodied.
---
"Cause you know, FNV was the greatest Fallout game since....Fallout 2. Yeah. /s
---
Second one is the wendigo colossus‚Äô ~~ball~~ vocal sack. Dunno the other.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so BS
---
Assassin weapons are trash. PvPers don‚Äôt even use them. The armor, on the other hand, is a necessity for PvP.
---
They care more about log in numbers than average play time. A person that logs in for 30 minutes every day is better than someone that plays 8 hours every other day. When you combine that with catering to the people that want to play a super easy fallout game with their buddies, it just leaves out a lot of the players that want a challenging and rewarding experience. If it wasn't for the people I played with I would've quit a long time ago.
---
also if you look at some of the other comments, you will see its a bit more complicated, I do appreciate the directness of the approach
---
I live 30 minutes from West Virginia border and worked all over West Virginia for 8 years so most in game places I've been to. Bit surreal.
---
Second one is a flamer puck sac I think don‚Äôt know about the other one
---
Not too long after I first started, I had trouble finding a shovel to do this. Was playing with some friends and one was like 'I got one, you can have it. Nice, or so I thought. I was level 30something and the damn shovel was level 50. Fml.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going to happen to this post when it has the flair ‚Äúremoved because of rule 6‚Äù. I am not accusing a specific person of scamming me and the whole point of this post was to vent my frustration. Another key thing that this post was for is to say how there needs to be a trade window, it‚Äôs just an easy and simple thing that would make our lives easier and make trading simple, because in this current state trading is something you are afraid of doing.
---
also, you are hardest on those you love - increased emotional stakes and all
---
Oh the pain!!!
---
Oh wow how lucky. I wish there was a Tennessee fallout
---
Scrip it. I dont keep any fatmans nor do I keep any missile launchers. They just aren't practical enough in this game to justify that weight the take up.
---
Yeah, I have a bloodied shotgun perk load I've been using since level 50. My bloodied combat with +50 vats damage hardly ever misses. What am I doing wrong? I'm using hardened receiver, but man, the spread (unlike the combat shotty) is all over the place!
---
I love doing that to people. It‚Äôs hilarious when I destroy their camp and see them go up to the module and stand there, because I know they are trying to repair all but they can‚Äôt.
---
I was lucky and for all of the SS pieces I needed I only used about 40 modules and that was mostly to get a chameleon piece. My friend has used more than that and hasn't gotten a single piece that works for him.
---
I log in every day for about 30min to 2 hours just to do daily and weekly challenges. Even doing them daily, because I dont manage a level up every day, i gather just about enough atoms to get one bundle a month or a couple nice things that I get to pick out as my reward for grinding. 
---
We grind for scrip, we grind now for bullion.
---
All seasons is is a system to take away the reward of atoms and basically force people to either pay cash for them or subscribe to First. Its a joke. Its honestly just a joke now.
---
Haha I do the same thing üòÇ
---
Scrip
---
There's a lady that posts videos about various topics, InnovSurvavlist (or something like that). But, yeah, I don't like the 3 hour videos where they do exploring. I can do that myself in the game.
---
Maybe slightly OT, but can you tame any of those blood raider armored doggos to keep at your camp? Even a mutant hound would be cool. I've seen deathclaws, sloths,  mirelurk kings, and and frogs as camp pets. I would love a camp doggo.
---
also imagine my shock and horror when I realized that this indeed was the most productive thing I could bring myself to do today, fuck me right? my feelings are stupid, shouldn't have said anything
---
My vote is for Innovsurvivalist. She has always maintained a level of sobriety when talking about bugs, glitches, controversy. Ive never seen her front load her content with a click bait title: *10 more things you probably didnt know about Fallout 76 but probably you did or are so insignificant that its a wash.* And she's just a nice person. Angry turtle is also good but his videos are more clinical- he records weapon testing and kookiness in the code that results in unintended consequences.
---
That depends. When it first became available and people wanted t replan but didn‚Äôt want to grind for it, it fetched over 20k. Then it dropped steadily for a while and got down to about 5k. Then it crept back up with the influx of new players, and average price is about 10k right now.
---
Have you? That's hilarious.
---
I had to listen to that damn mayor for another two weeks or so till I got to use. Never bothered finding another, I just waited till I hit 50, finished that damn quest and was done. Yet the mayor still never shat up. Fml still. Thankfully that's done and over.
---
this is true and i believe it will be fixed in patch 20 on june 30th
---
I agree with you, trap camps can be fun and I really enjoy the creativity that people put into camp designs.  I‚Äôm just butt hurt that I didn‚Äôt store my gear first, and that the owner was so predatory immediately. If this was the real apocalypse I‚Äôd target those types of people first haha.
---
Yeah, got all those. The damage, when it hits, is enormous! But without VATS it spreads like crazy. In VATs it hits only half the time.
---
Followed MrMatty back in the days of fallout 4 speculation... Good nostalgia
---
The first one is a flight data recorder.
---
Yep. Using skeetshooter...
---
People save up atoms from dailys to buy things they really want which isn't hard to do at the moment.  I'm not happy they are doing this change but it's needed for this game to continue and the people that aren't buying atoms now most likely won't after this change anyway they just now get less free stuff.
---
Agreed. Almost as petty as the other person, too.
---
Thanks! I think I'll have more luck finding those balls in a vendor than finding that thing in the wild.
---
His yinzer accent is terrible lol
---
Ya. I find it funny how toxic people can get over a video game. When I run into people like that, I wish them well and just walk. Not worth the time.
---
Yeah that was my first attempt. I was able to stack stairs about 12 high if my CAMP was placed the highest possible point whilst still being able to build from a valid foundation. I was still about 5 wall lengths off... the support pylon is considered a world object, so you cant place foundations in or on it without having another placed in the ground. I know the CAMP dimensions were changed at one point so It may be no longer possible. Thanks for replying!
---
My one friend who uses it told me that the first shot always misses in vats for some reason but after that it‚Äôs good. If you can get a good shotgun perk roll with 33% increase vats hits, that should make it a lot more viable
---
I‚Äôve been using some gimick to make one spawn, first you need to get the vendor to spawn at Charleston station ( head out of the 2 consecutive bridge and get back) you get a random encounter, either super mutant, a moth man, some dogs or ghouls , a robot who play flute for rats that follow him, a scavenger that ask something off you or the robot vendor. Once you have the robot ask a friend or use a second account to hold the vendor by browsing his inventory, That way he won‚Äôt disapear. Then join the game with your character, browse the vendor , no coat? Log out and log in, browse again, rinc√© repeat, it literally took me 5 to 7 hours of non stop log in log out before I got one, maybe 1 in a 100 robot sell it, so yeah it worth 30k
---
Wtf is wrong with you.
---
Thank you, that was the one I really wanted to get a copy of the most.
---
Flight data recorder, wendigo vocal sac, one of the mini nuke pieces that you can get during beckett's quest in the watoga underground, you can go there without the quest and get it. Forgot what room it was in, but there's 3 pieces.
---
Thanks. Will check this out. Although my current bane is Aluminum. Always running out of aluminum,
---
Alright!
---
Yeah, I may try out the mini myself. Got the plan, haven't crafted one yet. I swap perks between heavy gunner and  shotgun build for everyday walking around.
---
Bethesda knows what you want better than you do.
---
Thanks for this, I usually scrap weapons after uranium fever
---
Go to Sundew Grove by fissure prime after SBQ fight. Spawns pretty regularly there.
---
I mean it wouldn't be a Bethesda Fallout game without some bugs.  I kind of wish I had Shadowplay going the other day, as while I was at the Charleston Capitol to pick up the Water Purifier plans from the Overseer's chest, I turned a corner outside and like, six or seven Scorched literally just popped into existence in a cluster out of nowhere.  Scared the shit out of me.
---
Thanks I just felt bad because it was op in other fallouts but just needed to confirm if it was bad in this game
---
They‚Äôre gone. And if you add the ultimate Scrooge and scrap them before hopping to public, you get barely anything back compared to the cost of constructing. 
---
You could store them for use again at a later time before you hop off I guess, if your base isn‚Äôt at limit etc already. 
---
I tend not to bother. I use workshops on private and the ability to get passive resources without issue is worth the cost and loss.
---
they literally said early ranks it'll take 1 hour per rank, then it gradually goes up to 2-3 hours
---
You guys that do these things are fucking amazing. Thank you!
---
&gt; one of the mini nuke pieces
---
I guess I'll have to finish up Beckett's quest then. I ditched him when Gramps showed up. Thanks.
---
No problem, you also get a ton of other stuff like wood, black titanium, etc.
---
Hahaha.  I do that quest almost daily cause I am always grinding for rare outfits.  You are right, his voice is annoying!
---
Post your roll.
---
Yeah I just watched your gauss minigun vid. Helped me out a lot
---
I‚Äôm saving for the SS Jetpack right now and the temptation to get the mini was great. 
---
You ever use the mod for swapping out cards? I run an explosive bloodied lever action for wandering when I don‚Äôt wanna spool up the laser etc, but I‚Äôm considering using the mod to swap out my builds for guns/crafting.
---
&gt;for giving us a new *free* way to get atoms and other cosmetics
---
Except that's not all they're doing. They're giving us a new way to get Atoms and other stuff... by *replacing* the existing system, which many of us clearly kinda prefer, since it allows us to *choose* what we get, which we won't be able to do with Seasons.
---
How do you keep it from doing too much spread? The damage is enormous when it hits square. Once I get a tight VATs hit, Gun Fu hits thereafter are tight as well. It's just getting that first shot tight.
---
...aaaaand how did it turn out? :-)
---
Only keep those if they‚Äôre 90% reduced weight.
---
I haven't seen anything yet...
---
Got a link?
---
Both are incredibly powerful in VATS. No joke the caster/ ye old F1 plasma rifle is probably the best vats heavy gun in the game. Deservedly so, too.
---
This may not apply to you but evidently I have a NVIDIA graphics card and every time before I launch the game I have to open the NVIDIA GeForce Experience menu and re-optimize Fallout 76. I dont know why but it has a habit of slipping out of optimization. I can tell when the game isn't optimized because the frame rate is worse and the screen looks grainier.
---
Oh god, i hope they cant dupe them,i allready get pissed with the guys that come in events with their duped TSE gatling plasma and kill all the mobs.
---
If you able to move camps then Just to the left of the train station furthest north on the eastern side (sorry not on so can‚Äôt give names) there‚Äôs a pylon.  Go behind that and carry on walking and there‚Äôs an old half destroyed house. Carry further down and you will find aluminium on the floor so you can put one of the machines on.  I‚Äôve just moved my camp from there as I‚Äôve got way too much now haha
---
Lol, I've been looking for a 90wr legendary shovel for just the same reason.  Grats!
---
I posted that a lot of cosmetics look lame but I LIKE to spend atoms. It has nothing to do with crying that I am not getting enough **FREE** stuff.
---
At the end of the mine, on the right, through the door, there's a table (forget which one) that you can use to scrap you weapons, so that you don't have to wait to get to the WS stationto scrap.

Oh cool yea it‚Äôs a pretty nice area. Just so much to do in the DMV.
---
\&gt; How do you keep it from doing too much spread?
---
That's what I use the Skeet Shooter perk for.
---
Also, I don't use VATS most of the time.
---
 I put a short scope on my Gauss Shotgun and just free-aim for the head :)
---
Wish I could. I'm on console...

Uhhhhh what

Workshop persistence was a feature that was "planned" for private servers but there hasn't been any talk about that ever actually getting implemented... seems like Bethesda's hoping people just forget about it...
---
I'm willing to try anything. Thanks.
---
Ayeeee mines from flatwoods Kentucky but I used to go to Huntington and around West Virginia weekly our senior trip was to Camden park
---
I would recommend people use existing world containers (trash cans, suit cases, overseers stash, etc.) instead of dropping items into loot bags. Loot bags have a limited lifespan before they disappear from the game, especially if the player dropping stuff leaves the world/game. World containers seem to persist for hours. I'm guessing stuff will persist as long as the world is active.
---
I thought they had to be purchased. I corrected the text
---
Been grinding Riding Shotgun and got it off the captain.
---
Ahhh sorry, I should stop automatically assuming everyone is PC on here when the community is pretty diverse. 
---
Good luck on the mini when you craft it anyway!
---
Negative.  I've been seeing them sell for 5k max,  since there is a settler vendor selling them for 278 caps each
---
Yep, that's the old way of doing it before the recipes were commonly out there.
---
I don't remember people killing themselves in the process, but that may be because everyone I know that did it had access to rad removal and starched genes.
---
You said it right. You paid for the game, not for cosmetics. Well, maybe you could stick to the older version of the fallout that does not have any cosmetic shop.
---
&gt; How many atoms have you bought? For the vast majority of players I'm willing to make a wager that the answer to that question is zero.
---
about 200 dollars usd worth independently on top of being a fo76 member since the beginning. If you think Bethesda is hurting for revenue for FO76 you are mistaken. I remember reading in an interview that they were pleasantly surprised by the massive success of fallout 1st because of the all the bad press at the time of release.  They are revenue oriented insofar as every system in the game is designed to get you to spend time + money just to encourage you to spend more money and dgaf about your water wheel not spinning.
---
well. lots of xp and loot was had. 
---
got to about 41 doing this and now i'm just kinda server hopping looking for events. 
---
It's quicker getting geared up and going to westek. but that costs ammo and stuff. This is the lazier way.
---
I mean are you trying to snipe from a distance with it? If so you're gonna have a bad time. 
---
But i would say it has much better spread than any of the other shot guns in the game. My Bloodied FFR completely deletes everything it comes across, and I manage to hit on target both in and out of vats from a decent distance (keeping in mind that vats inconsistent in the first damn place).
---
steam summer sale is on: total cost for fo76, wastelanders, and settlers content bundle is now 30.99 at checkout.
---
im seriously considering picking it up myself
---
Thanks, I will. I'll be online again later. I really want to live this gun, because when it hits, it's amazing.
---
It's a bullshit daily that is now required to complete an atom challenge. All 5 of my characters already did it before they added it.
---
If you get lucky to do UF by yourself, you can usually double that amount to \~1K steel with the scrapper perk card
---
No problem!
---
Keep in mind that VATS is kinda bugged at the moment, which may be the true root cause of the issues you've been experiencing.
---
Griefing people
---
I like to use the present box and drop a few things  at intervals so it looks like a trail of presents.
---
Baaaaaa-hahahad surprise... :D

I changed my settings according to some of AngryTurtle's advice. Still getting random lags and stutters sometimes, but it's a lot smoother, I can run max graphics and the proper resolution now and it got rid of the overall choppyness.

---
I make fart noises until they run away.
---
They can be duped like any other weapon I believe.  Nothing stopping it really.  They make the rounds and get all over the place making them hard to impossible to remove without significant effort.  I tend to see several a session, (PC of course).
---
That said, most dupe glitches tend to work best on stackables, but as anyone can tell you, everything is dupable because dupe glitches are nothing compared to duping scripts or hacks.  I do not know however, how any of those are coming along at this time, or if they are up and running.
---
I never have any luck gifting stuff to low levels, spent 2 hours stalking lobbies trying to offload a bunch of stims, radaway, rad xbox, med x super stims, etc. But every time I would drop stuff and start emoting for them to come they would run away lol
---
It was a while ago. That was the going rate back then.
---
Yeah,thanks, I'm doing something wrong, I'm sure
---
Nice, thanks for the research work!
---
There's a static spawn for it in a cabin east-ish from Crater.
---
btw: you should post it here as well...: around apalachia photo submission thread "creature feature":

---
Lol not new but glad you figured it out. This was the run I'd do before I could easily handle West Tek. You can also use it to make your daily 1400 vendor caps easily.
---
I would really recommend moving on to West Tek once you can handle it though. You get about the same (if not more) steel but with far better exp and chances for caps/better ammo types. Blackwater Mines is like the mid-level equivalent while West Tek is for the end game player
---
Do builds count for this question? There's various things about how I build my characters in every Fallout game that I'm planning on doing in 76, even though I'm sure it's going to be suboptimal (from messing about a bit on nukesdragons).
---
* I never use chems. Ever. All my characters like to keep themselves clean.
---
* No mutations, curing any I do get as soon as possible. As above, I try to keep my characters normal and human in these mad wastelands they find themselves in.
---
* High intelligence, low charisma. I like solving things with science, but my characters aren't silver-tongued. In 76 low charisma isn't a huge issue as you only really need 4. I'm going to go with 8 intelligence for conversation checks though (due to the above I can't use chems or mutations to pump it up) which is probably going to mean leaving some other perks behind.
---
* I also always use added DR/ER perks. As far as I can tell looking at other builds people post almost nobody does this, but I'm going to because I always like doing that in Fallout games.
---
In terms of gameplay, I'm a bit of a goody-two-shoes, definitely not a raider. Generally try for the merciful option where possible (though the low charisma is an issue, sometimes means fights are unavoidable). Also I try to avoid wearing raider gear whenever possible. Meg probably secretly hates me.
---
Bruh if it's scrapping junk it's not gonna take you 3 hours lmao downvote bc your all cry baby's who think they are entitled to everything in a soft MMO
---
Can‚Äôt think of anything anyone did for me as a low level and I‚Äôm 180 now so unsure if people drop stuff for higher levels or not lol
---
But I helped a guy out with serums a month or so ago. He couldn‚Äôt buy any so I just gave them him after he messaged.  Then we got talking about weapons and he asked if I was able to mod his handmade, I decked it out fully for him and gave it back, he was made up.
---
Another time I did try to be nice to a low level straight out of the vault  and dropped him some stuff, he just walked straight past it lol I waved and showed him what I was pointing at and he just started hitting me haha will still leave some more stuff for newbies tho.
---
I wish
---
It‚Äôs a pain in the ass. Luckily the materials are still there for me but it‚Äôs the time that we waisted. What we ended up doing is I would quit every 3 minutes so it would save and it worked for about 2 hours and then I guess the game caught on because as I was logging out I was getting a sever disconnect at the same time. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Let‚Äôs see if today is different and I guess it‚Äôs not a wide spread issue like I thought. So maybe it is me??!
---
New Mountable plan : Big Mouth Battle Bass. Sings, Take Me To The River. ;)
---
A simple change I made was change it to full screen. Probably not your problem but it changed everything for me.
---
got the point i was running down the course and i didn't have to look at the screen for like 15-20 seconds as i knew exactly where i'd be.
---
Eh, just enjoy it, dont use guides or any of that crap. Grinding and guides turn the game into a chore/job rather than something to enjoy.

&gt; I‚Äôve been checking every time I play these last few days and they‚Äôre still offline
---
Proving a point by...stalking them? You sent them a stupid message you didn't need to, you went out of your way to nuke them when they told you to get gud, you've been stalking them for days to do *something to them* to 'prove a point.' That's...harassment, and you're kind of a piece of crap.
---
Riiiight, I know what you mean now. That was in the wood section, think it's a foundation of sorts.
---
I love using them as little jettys in the water. In Sanctuary Hills I have this cool wee fishing house, using lots of Far Harbour stuff to decorate. There's amfew of them run out into the river, set up with seats and little wooden fences for settlers to fish from.
---
I'm honestly so underwhelmed I barely play anymore. I loved this game but they've only done two good updates in over a year.
---
If you can't handle "MMO" grinding then play a different game. Far easier grind then real MMO's
---
West-tek also gives you a great chance to for several legendaries

psn: Owl_No

Not being able to roleplay the character I desperately want to is draining my motivation to play.  Most of it is cosmetic but hey, looking cool is what makes the game more fun to me.  All I want them to add is the Merc Outfits from Fallout 4‚Äôs Capital Wasteland Mercenaries pack.  All they have to do is port them over.  And to release some weapon skins in the files such as the R91 AR, the Screaming Eagle, and the standard Chinese AR.  I would be extremely grateful if they did these things but I have extremely low expectations that they ever will.
---
More character based cosmetics like hair styles, facial hair, tattoos, and paints are also welcome too!
---
And the guild system sounds great!  I think this game can really benefit from it.
---
Entitled or having a game literally take away every worthy reward as a money grab. Dont go there withvme. Ive defended this game to death. This is a slap in the face.
---
greggmason920 gave me the plans for the fixer

now he is my president of appalachia

The kindest thing that a player could do in F76 it's mute their mic üòÇ
---
Its the inside the vault this week, they show you what each level for seasons gives you
---
I post the occasional video on my channel. I don‚Äôt really consider myself a youtuber, but if you want to see grown men rage at being killed by me in a video game I‚Äôm your guy lmao
---
or keep every thing the same and let us craft what we want with no RNG.  Don't like paying 100 scrip for a 1 star weapon and having it suck just to trade it in for 5 scrip.  I know this is not what your getting at but I could tolerate the cool down more if I could craft what I wanted.  But I agree with you and all the comments on the post.
---
Then perhaps they should release shit people actually want to buy.
---
This is the one game where most of the cash shop cosmetics are incredibly underwhelming, that's why most of us save our atoms for the moment they actually sell something that doesn't look like ass and by the time they do we've already made twice as many Atoms as whatever the cost of those items will be.
---
This certainly isn't going to make me buy atoms and now I will save the ones I have exclusively for the really good stuff that will come probably once per season.
---
Path of Exile sells tens of thousands of dollars in cosmetic packs at the beginning of every season because they sell stuff people actually want and those cosmetics are much more expensive than whatever FO76 has.
---
BOS Bundle? Nah. Enclave Bundle? Nah. Faction paint jobs for all PA/Armor? Nah. More hairstyles, paint and tattoos? Nah. Cool paint for the most popular weapons? Nah. Worker overalls that nobody wants? Yes! Make several variations too! This is why when people ask why hasn't Bethesda added any of that the answer simply is "Because Bethesda doesn't like money."
---
It‚Äôs actually a really fun fight if you aren‚Äôt prepared. I fought it twice just me and a buddy and I got gangbanged by a 15 strong group of his wendigo offspring a few times.
---
After that I started checking out sundew grove that choov mentioned in the nuke area after a queen fight, and he is there pretty often and a lot easier to kill as he gets trapped. I‚Äôve killed him solo there 3 times now and I sell his sack in my vendor usually for 250.
---
It's so strange because I did the NW challenges stuff on PC and didn't encounter a single hacker. Usually lived pretty long in almost every match, would have noticed eventually.
---
I wonder if certain regions are more prone to it?
---
‚ÄúAt least they aren‚Äôt on creation engine...‚Äù he says. Trust me, they are infinitely worse on a whole as company. I‚Äôm not trying to defend Bethesda if that‚Äôs what you think. Just saying don‚Äôt compare them to a garbage company to try and make them look bad when said company is much worse.
---
I got my BE laser for free. 
---
Met a dude at one violent night. He pvpd me, killed me.
---
Invited me to his party, talked a minute or so about his kids and wife, how he was currently in the army. Thanked him for his service then asked me to come back to his camp where he gifted me my BE laser. My first and only legacy to this day. 
---
His name was cj and he literally is never playing anymore and didn‚Äôt accept my friend request but hey it was pretty fucking cool either way. 
---
Hindsight being 20/20 this was around the wild Appalachia update and the Scrip machine duplication sooooo he probs had another 30 or so of them.
---
Yeah, forgot to mention this. A lot of times you won't find anything but there's often at least one legendary somewhere. Most I've seen is a total of 5 or 6, half of them 3*s. There's probably better legendary farming methods at this point but West Tek is still up there.
---
What is this about pics? I had one daily to photo so e stuff, never again. How does one start this up. On the same note my Ally stopped with the dallies, any way to fix that?
---
What if it‚Äôs the camp owner trying to put something else in their vendor? Then you‚Äôre just fucking yourself by making them leave so they can use their own machine.
---
Average Steam Fallout 76 player count is down almost 40% in the last 30 days since the May vendor fiasco.  I expect the to dive even more if Bethesda nerfs the atoms.  It's killing the incentive to play every day.
---

---
Monroe is close AF tbh
---
True.
---
I had my space women do that, just ran from the savage divide through the ash heap and back to my camp.  I watched it all in real time on my map.  I have no idea what she was up to.
---
Actually so far I'm way more limited by script still then bullion.  I mean it doesn't take too long to buy the plans you need, then want, and now i'm down to "F it, I'll buy em all" and have already cleared out the settlers and raiders.
---
SS will take a bit I admit but I'm long past stuff I need or even want, this is just for lulz.  And I'm still re-rolling a couple pieces of thorn armor to get the right ones.  Script still feels like the limiting factor to me.
---
His lore videos are pretty on point. Lots of people hate Ox just cus he defends the bethesda titles.
---
And alot of the other stuff you mentioned are extremely old videos and stuff. He's also very religious but he doesnt push it on people. What you're doing is basically like canceling someone for a 10 year old tweet. Lots fo people are shitty when they're younger. He's clearly matured.
---
I have tracked down and tried various "magic guns" none seem to work. Can you shed a little light as AT video didn't help despite taking notes.
---
I already use scrapper
---
Nice share. I‚Äôve been thinking about compiling a list of all the pros and cons that can be proven factually. It would be overwhelming to say the least. Especially if we‚Äôre talking about stuff like leaked personal information, bag gate, the Australia court case, the list goes on.
---
Yeah, at this point it feels almost like they are actively trying to sabotage the game for anyone that isn't going to continuously spend money. Their shit customer support, the overall lack of improvement with the thousand plus bugs, and lack of real end game content, ended my desire to pay for FO1st.
---
Do you use Stealth Suit or something else with that?
---
Yea
---
I just run the true mods on all my shotguns and site aim with them. I stopped running them as primary weapons because of all the issues with vats and the regen bug with enemies.
---
Please elaborate
---
All good mate. Just wanted to help clarify.
---
you can get raiders to ally in an hour. glitch is not patched.
---
Go to the Allegheny Asylum, lots if surgical trays etc, you‚Äôll swim in aluminum in no time.
---
Edit: also called Fort Defiance
---
Second is wendigo colossus voice sac
---
They are still releasing atom shop content and seasons is strictly optional. 
---
If you want to argue that they're removing a massive amount of ways to earn atoms for free or that you should be able to purchase what ever season content without having to go through the lesser content, well I'd support that argument.
---
No its not lol. Far from it. A slap in the face would have been making us pay for seasons. Sorry that that you feel entitled to everything in a game thats had free content since launch with an optional atomshop purchases.
---
Rare-ish. Worth a few thousand caps to be sure but nothing outrageous.
---
&gt;Lots of people hate Ox just cus he defends the bethesda titles.
---
Yeah. I mean a lot of times even on this subreddit you get a lot of hate for doing exactly that too. It Just Works.
---
&gt;He's clearly matured.
---
Has he though?
---
Harassment, no. There has been no contact. Stalking, yes. Waiting patiently for them to come back online so I can nuke, also yes... 
---
Kind of a piece of crap? What is it, am I crap or not?
---
I feel the same but with Ghoul skin. I don't know why but i love to play fallout games from the perspective of a ghoul. 
---
Just ask the guys over at Zenimax. In ESO you can paint your equip, transmog, wear outfits, get skins and even polymorphs! So you can even play as a draugr etc. They make some serious money with this stuff and game is quite healthy.
---
If you compare the cosmetics from eso crown shop to the atom shop it is embarassing how few options fallout 76 has.
---
Mountain scout with stealth suit helmet
---
Edit: if your looking for something similar and on Xbox I can craft you and insurgent Outfit.
---
There are literally already challenges in the game to set a precedent if there actually are score challenges linked to NW... it's shit like "use stimpaks" and "take pictures" with the most difficult being actually killing a few other players or creatures.
---
It doesn‚Äôt drop that often from the Riding Shotgun event. So yes, it‚Äôs pretty accurate.
---
walk your happy ass directly to the nearest train station
---
Blue print your workshop(s), that way next session, just claim and place.
---
But you'll look so trendy hiding in the bushes in your new ghillie marine armor
---
There is a CBBE port that exists, but it is sort of buggy because we don‚Äôt have the ability to modify the new clothing and armor meshes, so I‚Äôve just gone back to using EVB which you can get from Nexusmods
---
Does this save the items or will you still need the materials to rebuild your items?
---
The internet sucks at my house lately and I've found myself playing FO4 more. I forgot how much I miss Dogmeat.
---
Fuuuuuuuuu
---
u got me. Would rather have been rickrolled lol
---
I'm just comparing total atom value of stuff earned vs total atoms you could earn with the old system. I'm not considering how much each item would be used or wanted. That's too difficult to do because of how people's tastes and buying habits vary.
---
Pretty much every example you gave was from years and years ago. So yeah...It's literally just like going through someones twitter from years and years go and using one thing to prove they're awful. It's a horrible thing to do to someone.
---
Cancel culture is gross.
---
If Bethesda is nerfing atoms this much, I want repeatable Combat challenges. I‚Äôd be okay with killing 1000 Blood Eagles for 40 Atoms. (As long as it isn‚Äôt for a specific weapon like the stupid robot challenges.)
---
I am not a fan of this new seasons system if they‚Äôre taking away our ways to get free atoms. If Bethesda got such a huge backlash for delaying Fasnacht for a few days, then we need to make an even bigger backlash to let them know we aren‚Äôt okay with our free atoms getting taken away.
---
Really i got it 5 timea in a row
---
thats a long walk, and by then, the nuke could've already dropped and everyone else killed the enemies / sbq
---
You could only have gotten it if you played fallout prior to fo76s release on steam
---
that made it, thanks!
---
Pardon Sir, if i want to roleplay i need only one thing, my imagination. Everything else is bonus. 
---
The tools available in the game simply determine how easy and fun it is to me and others.
---
Buying the game lol
---
Stop hogging all the luck :(
---
yep, worked. thanks mate. wtf beth...
---
This game literally couldn't produce free content without some source of income. Otherwise corporations would shut it down. Go look at battlefield ahhajajaa. No money flow so they pulled the plug.
---
But my mom doesn't charge me rent to live in the basement, why does bethesda need to?
---
I am selling them for 50 caps per
---
I did the story line around 50.juat never launched a nuke to finish it
---
I got a Sentry Bot to bad companion for a while, just a random encounter but fun.
---
Scrapping some outfits :(
---
sucks for you, maybe you should get better at inventory management so you don't find yourself in this situation
---
Juicehead for news and speculation. He really doesn't waste time, and I appreciate it.  
---
Kevduit cracks me up, and I have used about 5 of the builds from his videos and love them all (with some modifications of course).  
---
Norespawns is my favorite, strictly because he's chill AF, has awesome builds, awesome videos and to me, feels like he is genuinely enjoying going over it all.
---
Mmm probably the only thing that fits this for me is not doing the settler quest line at all for the stealth suit plan.  Roleplay wise I don't regret it in the slightest though.
---
We don‚Äôt know exactly how much score you earn for things. Who knows. I just know we will see a lot more people grinding public events.
---
Ok, Negative Nellie. Guess what. this is almost admitting that you lost.
---
I agree on both of your statements.
---
But to those who think it's OK to shoot and hit everyone while they are at vending machines, why is waiting a few moments beyond you all?
---
I may be deciding on a purchase and all hell breaks loose around me, so distracting.
---
A friend of mine did that yesterday. :(
---
A bloodied build guy was rooting around in his scrapbox, and when I nuke mined him, he died and dropped over 3000 aluminum scrap. I payed it forward by using the aluminum to repair my weapons that would later be used to send other players to a better place.
---
You're good, take care.
---
It saves everything. It'll place your generator(s), resources, turrets etc... in the same location. You just have to equip the perk cards (if needed to originally place item) to be able to deploy the blue print. I spent hours one weekend, claiming and blue printing all the workshops.
---
I don't know if you have ever watched Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction back in the day. It was a show about paranormal stories that people claim have happened. One of the stories involved a sick child who loved this one teddy bear. He ended up being declared legally dead at the hospital and was being taken to the morgue for an autopsy to figure out why (the cause of the sickness was unknown). His sister wanted to make sure that he had this teddy bear with him in death. So the father and the sister went back to the hospital and placed the teddy bear next to his body. The boy ended up reviving and waking up.
---
So when I see teddy bears, I think of that story. Maybe that teddy bear that you are looting was once loved very much.
---
Edit: Oh sweet, someone posted it on youtube. Here is the link if you want to watch it [https://youtu.be/gtj\_vziSfck](https://youtu.be/gtj_vziSfck)
---
That is very productive and fine tuned.  Amazing really. And I miss the PC sometimes for that ability to chain characters from multiple accounts and get all the Group buffs.  If it is possible on the console I surely haven‚Äôt figured it out.
---
ManyATrueNerd has entertaining content in general, but yes, covering Fallout is a relatively small part of what he posts on a daily basis.
---
I tried poping a Grape Mentats, gear, and a few aid items to see if it would make a dent. I had 11 CHA and this character isn't a CHA build and it sill wanted 1468 for it from 1600.  
---
BGS has made almost every aspect of this game a time sink. Considering you have to be level 15 to craft it WTF would it be that expensive? You can't regain time that you've lost.  
---
I play all other Fallout games on PC. With mods and console commands I can make my gaming time more effectively than TINY yield grinding results.
---
Why not both.
---
What system are you on?
---
Great work!
---
Some additions:
---
Brahmin Milk in Flatwoods or the pond across from Pleasant Valley Station  
---
\- Cranberries and Honey from Aaronholt Homestead  
---
\- Canned Coffee if you go through the Whitespring itself with Can Do on  
---
\- Tick Blood from Moonshiner's Shack / Gilman Lumber Mill  
---
\- Corpse Seeds are only from Death Blossoms  
---
\- Carrot Flowers from the Wayward  
---
\- Mutfruit all around the Wayward / Flatwoods area
---
Glad you got all sorted out! :)
---
No problem, here's a comment I made earlier. If you're unsure of anything just ask!
---
Idk if we are talking about the cash version, we got a real match.
---
Saying Bethesda is forcing you to play the game is simply a retarted take its your choice to grind the challenges and it‚Äôs your choice to buy stuff from the atomic shop, if you find yourself getting bored or annoyed with Bethesda here‚Äôs a radical idea play. another. game.
---
It's just you, sitting on 40 badges currently.  I swear the drop rates changed as lately I haven't been getting many but I know it's just RNG screwing with me. Don't forget about operation tidy and camp fire tales for extra chances to not get any, lol.
---
I thought the same thing before. Then realized I am receiving the badge. It is very quick, it gives it to you, is seems just as you turn the items in. It will be a very quick \~1 second animation.

How about adding the effects of each drink?
---
Go to the Overseers House to trigger it daily. You can pick Foundation or Crater to take pics of. You can sell them to the opposite faction for rep instead of giving them to Davenport. 
---
No idea. Happening to me too.
---
I‚Äôve taken some decent pics for myself thinking ‚Äúya this is good!‚Äù However that is epic!
---
Visited a friend in Waterbury a year ago. I loved it up there!
---
You should try this during Uranium Fever then, all the mole miners in the mine plus the countless ones from the event, nets you somewhere over a thousand steel. (West Tek is also good for steel.)
---
I just fought 3 queens in a row with someone using this strategy. It was great.
---
I believe I have 9 Outfits, 11 Backpacks, 7 Flags and 9 Gas masks
---
I agree
---
I once bought 30k with of garbage out of someones vending machine then dropped it all.
---
Ok so I was wrong. Tank killer and one other still stagger her.
---
Multiball! MULTIBALL!
---
Scrapped a Leather Coat, got it soon after game launch &amp; didn't realize I should be saving outfits.
---
Thank you. As for my second problem I have yet to switch allies because I have a bar and Becket fits perfectly. I would like to think if scrap him and change him it may start again. But I'm to lazy.
---
Cancel culture is deeply problematic. That being said I did not call for a cancellation of him: I listed the reasons from the video I linked from a year ago, said it's fine to keep watching if a person wants, but I personally don't want to.
---
Don't try to use logic and math here, people here have no grasp on reality. They think that $60 is an unlimited bottomless development budget that can support the full development of a modern AAA game, post release server costs for eternity, bugfixes forever without error/fault/delay, and that them simply playing the game somehow makes bethesda money so they can provide free content updates forever. I wonder if they don't put gas in their car and then call the gas station angrily when it runs out demanding that they be given more gas because they've been driving the whole time and should have earned more gas for it.
---
Gilbert Hobson is such a cool dude. I enjoyed my conversation with him.
---
This is why I love Fallout 3 so much, as a DC metro area native!
---
Harper's ferry. Between the armory and town there's maybe 30+ air conditioner boxes attached to buildings. 
---
Each had a coolant cap, 2 aluminun a pop. 
---
Server hop and repeat.  I don't even bother keeping it in my stash any more, just go get it when i need it.
---
Marsupial or jetpack helps as they are all on the 2nd story
---
I have a collection of notebooks with recipes, glitches, tips and builds etc etc. All alphabetically ordered by game. I dont think I'm on the scale or anything. 
---
One day I'll have to larn me sum spreadsheeting.
---
Nooooo the Cash version is loads better. I just put them together since both styles are so similar
---
You can get them from workshop events for sure. If you're on ps4 I have an extra plan for acoustic instruments.
---
My first 150 levels were spent scripting junkies weapons. I distinctly remember scripting a JFFR combat rifle. To be fair I don‚Äôt think there were as many junkies users then as now. But still......
---
God damn it!
---
Are you on xbox?  I would be willing to build them in your camp for you :)
---
Exactly.
---
Oh if we are talking the non cash version, then obviously big iron yeah.
---
I hate when people do that while I'm adding a few items to one of my machines.
---
That time I wasn‚Äôt a bloodied build and dropped my ffr bloodied lmg cause it was useless and heavy...
---
That‚Äôs what I originally thought, but saw the wiki and figured that there was something else going on.  
---
The wiki seems to cut off the bonuses after 16, so a test of CHA 25 from Unyielding and 16+Hard bargain should net the same results regardless.  I might be better trying something like 10 charisma and 4 Charisma with Hard Bargain 2.  That would be a better test, based on the wiki data.  
---
My main character hits 25 anyways with Grape Mentats + Hard bargain easy, so I never even check anyways, and it‚Äôs rare I care about buying.
---
It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.
---
That's good to know, I'll keep an eye out for it, and check the number in my collections tab to see if I really am just missing it.  Guess I'll continue turning in all those bloodbug probscis' then.
---
When the fun becomes work, that's when you need to quit.
---
I got mine from hemlock holes workshop events. But you must be getting unlucky with player vendors, as they‚Äôre usually cheap, I usually put my spares up for whatever they land on from 20-50 caps.
---
Oh, that's a great idea. I'll work on that later. :)
---
I cant agree more.  Let us be able to progress through the entire season without the need to enter NW.
---
Are you blue screening or just DC from server?
---
yeah, but its not right to spread essentially conspiracy videos about people cherry picking decade old examples of why they're a bad person. You could do that to anyone to make them look bad. It's deeply manipulative and destructive. 
---
It's deeply problematic and you're part of the problem, do you not see that?
---
EDIT- also it should be known the video you linked, was made by a guy who had a long history of harassing Ox. So he had plenty of motivation to distort facts to do a hit job on his reputation. But yeah keep spreading hate videos....
---
so this post is about a battle for vendor between 2 noobs
---
if you are a whiney complainer that likes to constantly start threads on the internet.. do not buy
---
It makes no difference you can notice after the initial effect
---
also.. its always been good...
---
My camp is near Huntersville and I did a quick farm of it. I could hear fighting in the middle of the town, and thought another player was doing the same as I. So I quickly ran up so as to not miss out on legendary enemies, and low and behold, there was Beckett, with a  minigun from a downed enemy, fighting the muties. Once we killed them all, he just ran back to my camp. Probably to take a dump.
---
no dont get it u will die and complain about the game cuz u noob, so stay away and play fortnite which is free
---
I just wanna know what objects have it bruh
---
Believe me it‚Äôs worth the money wastelanders update really saved this game!! Only issue is some bugs but the game itself is really great brought it for 20 euro on xbox one. At that time it was worth it i liked the game. But woth  wastelanders the game is really worth it. Give it a go. More awesome updates are coming in the future!
---
"Oh there it is.."
---
Well, compared to the more easily-acquired "magic shotguns," they are underwhelming.  All of my toons are VATS-centric, so their unreliable VATS behavior makes all of them a no-go for me.  The truth is, a lot of weapons can one-shot Lv. 68 enemies with the right perk loadout, and at some point, things like the Gauss Shotgun are just overkill unless you're dealing with the SBQ or something like that.
---
Plus, I still can't get past the idea that they added all of this Gauss weaponry as a top-tier reward and never bothered to fix the VATS issue that has plagued the Gauss Rifle from practically the beginning.
---
I was expecting to see it in the "rewards" list, but it is an animation similar to that of receiving caps. It's the: Badge Icon (small)      +1

I 100% am the guy that punches everyone.   Your afk would never effect me. I‚Äôll keep punching you for hours because I‚Äôm drunk and time means nothing :p
---
This comment right here.
---
That would probably explain the influx of low-level players from the Vault today.  Be nice to the new players.
---
I will trade my anti-armor golf club for that bad boy!
---
 Angry Turtle (and Mitzi) because he tests everything, Captain Noob for his f'n this and f'n that, I picture him with a Nuka beer cap on his head as he plays.
---
Yeah
---
Bruh, Their asking if it's good.
---
That ain't whining.
---
I shall add that in, as well! Thanks for the suggestions.
---
It doesn't save the materials and it doesn't save the locations either. Have you actually tried to use the Blueprints since you created them?
---
i always figured it was, just think it'd be cool to meet a Nuka painted Mr. Handy who would give you some product samples and maybe even a special Nuka themed item for finding him.
---
I‚Äôm not okay with seasons at all, Daily and Weekly challenges were my main atom income, yes I‚Äôve got Fallout 1st but 1650 atoms on the 4th of every month isn‚Äôt going to be a reliable source of atoms if I have no atoms and my 1st atoms are two weeks away, yet the thing I want is gone in one week. And that‚Äôs just for a Fallout 1st player, imagine this for players without 1st.
---
This is a real scumbag move on Bethesda‚Äôs part, if they got such a huge backlash for Fasnacht being delayed, we need to give them an even bigger backlash over our free atoms getting taken away. At what point does Bethesda stop punishing their own players?
---
‚ÄúSome bugs‚Äù lmao don‚Äôt lie to him
---
Just dc from server. Literally just happened as I was 4/5s done with an event
---
I'd be great of there was a mic button on console
---
Oh that makes sense. I use ultracite pw armor. Got a free set from the brotherhood questline. But yeah sorry, I don't often see it in mine so I'm afraid I wouldn't know grinding for it
---
We need a npc from Jersey. He'll explain that he left cuz of the Jersey Devil, but he didn't know about all the stuff from WV! Lol

He's thinking of the blueprints you get when you move your camp

Please read our wiki page on this subject

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Damn. Guess I never noticed,
---
If there's nothing worth buying then why is everyone so upset that they'll be getting fewer atoms to not spend on stuff?
---
Ew, edgy
---
I also think that you can pay max scrip to customise a gun with legendary but you don‚Äôt know which gun
---
i dont speak putin
---
Hmm not sure about that. I know what causes influxes in crashes but DCs are a bit different. Have you tried clearing cache/rebuilding database?
---
They may have been dicks, but they didnt take by force. We need to also remember  this is an 2nd end of the world scenario, pre vault dwellers, they were standing between the schorched the civilians. They needed everything they could get, in glass cavern if I'm not mistaken, there are so many dead SBs, and scorched minions. Without the BOS, the plague would haven taken down the responders in no time, they just didnt have the military power.
---
Yeah, it's gotta be that!
---
OK thanks

I always keep my first toon.. even after I have made better ones once I figure out what I did wrong the first time
---
Thank you. I'm on PC. So no chance to get it
---
–ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –±–æ–≥

(Lmao, that made me laugh slightly)
---
I‚Äôd marry one
---
It's been a month or so since. It worked for me before, something change?
---
I found it at times real finicky to place, especially of you have lots of items to place.
---
Pretty sure you can get a magic gauss shotgun roll. Just like you can make a gauss minigun magic mode too.
---
**loads LMG with malicious intent**
---
I dropped loads of plans and got a bloodied combat shotgun for it and it's a beast lol
---
I had fun.  Newness is gone.  Grinded what I wanted stopped playing because I‚Äôm maxed everything with everything I wanted.  It‚Äôs just a natural game cycle that‚Äôs run its course.  Go play something else till new shit happens.
---
They redid the story just slightly so I would recommend starting over. It feels better and introduces you to things in a more organic way
---
Killing Johnny isn‚Äôt consequence enough?!
---
/s
---
Also, be aware, there is a visual bug with the Collections tab. It can show 0 Badges (as well as 0 of other things) regardless of your total. To see the accurate amount, check one of the Possum Vendors to see your current and accurate total.
---
I already hate seasons. At 1600 hours I‚Äôve done nearly every character, survival, combat, social, and world challenges, so basically Weekly and Daily challenges are the only way to get atoms for me. (Plus FO1st atoms but those aren‚Äôt reliable if I get my atoms in two weeks when the thing I want disappears in one week.)
---
We need to make a bigger backlash than when Fasnacht was delayed for a few days if Bethesda is taking away our free atoms, this is unacceptable to punish your own player base this much.
---
Decent suggestion.
---
&gt;with VATS currently broken the build is already obsolete
---
From a PvP-only perspective, I guess.
---
Who‚Äôs Johnny? The fancy suit raider?
---
That would be the dream piece for farming those unarmored ghouls at WS.  Bwahahaha
---
Players need to just stop putting their damn tents and Camps at the SBQ and the crap would work fine....
---
Okay cool. Is it set up in a way that I need to do the original sorry first and then the new one second? Or do they coincide?
---
Now I feel bad that I robbed him...
---
This is awesome!! Thank you. So tired of always checking or creating a list on nitepad when i needed ingredients.
---
Its a hacked weapon a beamsplitter on the handmade. It violates TOS and is a bannable offense, save a video of the person with it, report them, they will be banned.
---
Hopefully soon.
---
I'd love to play 76 with more people. My friends have stopped playing so much. Im putyinabox789 on xbox. I'll look you up!
---
R.I.P.
---
That is a good idea, maybe like you get to pick 4    items of your choice daily
---
"may have?" they are dicks, if they put the civilian todo every day tasks they would have more soldier on the front, if they trained the civilians to do little scouts for supply they would have better strengths and not need to raid who is help civilians, fuck brotherhood I had huge respect for them not anymore.
---
even at the cave they did not could finish the job(forgot why) was sad, they helped a lot yes, but they are at the same lvl as the raiders,  they killed civilians for supply.
---
For VATS I find you need to lock a target twice. Lock it once, unlock, lock a second time, then fire. Usually results in a hit. Gun Fu after a successful kill also seems to work fine as well. The GS also has a bad habit of locking my selection wheel. You end up being unable to swap. If that happens hit your bash button which usually does the trick.
---
Alright then, fight me now then fight me when my PvP build is finished. Then we‚Äôll see how P2W extra XP is shall we?
---
Oh and they give us enough bullshit with bugs that have been here since day one I think we‚Äôre entitled to more free shit, not less.
---
It shouldn't be since all this means is they need to clone all existing versions of weapon plans and shoehorn in two Legendary Modules.
---
I'd love for them to expand the Bullion system to include crafting of all types of equipment so they can remove the Scrip limit. In my eyes you should have an unlimited amount of Scrip so you can reroll Legendaries with plans you bought for Bullion.
---
Ayyy ct gang
---
I use that Skeeter perk when I know I am in a shotgun only place but if I am swapping to rifle, I don‚Äôt use it, but even so my ‚Äúhit rate in VATs‚Äù is like 90%+.  I am curious why your hit rate is so low?  I have Instigating and can‚Äôt believe the damage, but there is that half a second to load the next round where my 8 shooter shotgun can rapid fire and hits like a truck as well.  Sometimes when I know I will get a job rush and no where to keep distance I switch to my traditional shotgun so I can get them all rapidly.  No explosive damage deaths to myself that way.
---
I got it a couple weeks ago and from my experiance so far the game is amazing. The main quest, while short, is still fun and interesting, however the exploring, combat, and enviormental story telling is better than it has ever been. Building has been improved and it fells like you can do more with junk than you can in Fo4. Perk cards and leveling up S.P.E.C.I.A.L is a fun and unique way of leveling up. Imo this game is better than Fallout 4 and maybe even 3
---
&gt;Shotguns should be really powerful at close range but they should have a steep dropoff.
---
[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun)
---
Don't forget calibrated shocks of 50/leg... Love that setup.
---
Thought this was gonna be a whiny post but your bang on about exploring and finding stuff. Would be better if they just started sneaking new items here and there without telling us and give people a reason to wander
---
You will get the same story with your original toon too.   Just fast travel back to vault 76 and talk to the two girls on the stairs.
---
I simply answered the question with what I knew. I did not call to cancel him, although "distorting facts" is hilarious, a great majority of the video I linked is him talking or the posts he's written.
---
I'm also over this back and forth. He has said homophobic shit. He has misogynistic views. Unless I see that he has changed, then I'm not going to put up with a person who thinks of me as a less than human.
---
I'm from Finland...yeah, nothing...I'll get me coat.
---
The responders tried to train civilians,  said civilians stole supplies, and didnt get very far. The BOS was killing SBs, they couldn't exactly pull man power to train civilians who might ditch them. Also at mount thunder in the start they were training civilians, some of the notes mention the civilians not being able to take it. The difference between and raiders are, raiders take for thier good, the Bos took for the good of everyone.
---
Unless they changed it, you can blue print work shops.
---
Oh okay so if I do that then there's no point in starting fresh?
---
Honesty,  vats is broken for the most part. Not really fair to assess a weapon based on vats
---
fanbase cant handle real choices or consequences..
---
I realized that after posting but it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt sell to players or store it for later. Also, you can get more than 1400 caps. Vendors from different factions have separate caps so if you sell to vendors from raiders and to vendors from foundation and any other that I may not know about than you can get more caps in a day.
---
For those of us that actually play NW, it's nice that when I equip wood or scout armor I will have the guillie variant. Currently, I spawn  with the guillie suit but it usually gets immediately removed as soon as I grab some armor. This way I can maintain some camo in the mode.
---
Ive rolled about 50-60 rolls since wastelanders. Got two unyielding chest pieces first two rolls, but since then I‚Äôve gotten nothing worth mentioning
---
Yeah. I noticed that and was supremely bummed.
---
Yep, would have made it so much better. Too many people would whine about not being able to do both sides though. I understand why Bethesda did it.
---
At 25 you can get Excavator armor and I do that every time.  By then you have picked up a half dozen cores (50%) here and there.  Then on top of advice above where you swap out better, I throw on the PA when I know I am going into a bigger fight.  Also great for carrying junk, then get plastic and do bulk so you can sell excess to get your daily caps.  Until 50 try not to waste a lot of caps on buying armor or weapons.  Sure if something is crazy cheap and pimped out and it will server you for 5-8 levels go for it.
---
Exact same for me. I don‚Äôt want to rebuild the bar.
---
I take the Cannibal perk even though I have way too much food on me at all times, because I like to wear the Red Deathclaw Mask and Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit and RP as a friendly garbage disposal crazy person. I‚Äôm gonna drop it to take points in Adrenaline for a damage buff but it‚Äôs been pretty fun. I‚Äôm a Rifle user and steamroll everything except the SBQ pretty easily so it‚Äôs been fine but I am using WAY too much ammo in those fights
---
I don't buy microtransactions normally but i have spent a very small amount on them in this game. 
---
I think as much a Fallout fans have been really upset with the monetisation from Bethesda it's better if fallout 76 keeps going rather than if in 18 months time they come out and said that they were shutting the servers because no new people are buying the game to make it worth keeping around
---
It's weird, it's kinda southern, kinda Upper Midwestern/Canadian
---
It's balanced. I like visually seeing when  my opponent has marine armor if I'm still in wood (i.e outgeared). Its just silly to have my reward that I grinded for become immediately useless within about 2 minutes of most matches.
---
well they broke/nerfed vats to deal with complaints from PVPers I guess but VATS is broken for everyone it literally does not hit 50% of the time even with a 95% hit chance and the target literally right in your face.
---
PVP has no place in a game with a built in aimbot to begin with and breaking a trademark of the game (VATS) to appease a very small percentage of the player base is just dumb.
---
Haha. It's a fine line between whine and constructive criticism I guess!
---
I dont know how ture it is but I heard a rumor that a later expansion for the game will have a secondary map based in Tennessee kinda like the did with far harbor ( I think that was the name)
---
Battle of the noobs, available on Steam.
---
I don't have 1st. So I guess 1500 if possible to get and that's it for me.
---
You can, absolutely, just blueprinting them doesn't save the materials
---
The workshop does however always provide a random amount of each material, which would greatly reduce the cost of rebuilding the blueprints, didn't think of that before
---
They might be pesky, but the meat ain't bad
---
OK great reply! I'll shall from now on be called Karen üò¢
---
Thanks OP!
---
No, you can do it however you like still. I just personally started a new character. I already had 3 before wastelanders and I just found it worked better for me and I liked the main story better starting over. But it also depends on what you get out of 76. If you could care less about the story it doesnt really make a difference.
---
This. He even talked about his younger days and acknowledged all of it. People can have opinions and beliefs about things. If he disagrees he disagrees, doesn't justify anyone making people into social outcasts and calling them names. This social justice crap and virtue seeking has got to stop already.
---
Ooooh I hope it includes Clarksville but Nashville will be cool
---
You don't have to.   It's the same storyline, just that you will be stronger than alot of the beginning NPC's.
---
Lmao. The serious game breaking bugs are gone for me the past months. I have the xbox one first gen
---
Didn't manage to hold that...
---
TBM was to pre-order the game.
---
I made a choice that enabled me to get a legendary mask. But the real consequence was that Bethesda had to remove it.
---
Now you only need Abby and Joel.
---
Okay I might just start over then. I can't really even remember what was going on.
---
What pisses me off, is That Beth said something like "We weren't happy with Daily/weekly activities and wanted to make those better", when they clearly were not happy with amount of atoms we were getting. Activities were fine by them.
---
Nuking Whitesprings is arguably the best place to farm Legendaries, I don‚Äôt know of any others good places.
---
Yes im with you.
---
If we must have to deal with this shitty seqsons thing, dont force us to do the NW challenges.
---
All of those clips are like a decade old. Most taken wildly out of context on purpose to hurt his reputation. You keep saying you're against cancel culture, yet it works on you and you actively spread it.
---
Remember when Kevin Hart got fired from the Oscars because of a decade old tweet that was a joke? This is literally the same thing and you're supporting it.
---
It's gross.
---
Ft. Defiance and The Burrows are also nice.
---
Ah Ok cool. I kinda don't want to launch it since I've come across the Overseer's holotape with her freaking out that 76ers launched some from Site Alpha. I'd like it if there were someway to resolve the storyline without having to resort to launching yet another one...
---
The YouTubers listed here are all amazing but you should follow [this one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), he‚Äôs the best.
---
They should be.  Their high damage is offset by both their effective range and, in theory, their durability.
---
Shotguns exist in two extremes right now.  Either you don't use VATS, and you are subjected to that horrible damage rubberbanding on virtually every shot.  Or you use VATS and you one-shot pretty much everything if you have one of these Legendary quirks.  The latter comes at the expense of maintaining enough AP for VATS.
---
The disturbing thing is that this damage rubberbanding has steadily gotten *worse* over the months, to the point where even Rifleman builds in VATS are frequently subject to shots that won't count.  And I see *zero* attempt by Bethesda to fix it.  I mean, that's pretty damn foundational, isn't it?  That the player's shots deal damage?  I'm pretty sure their Quake netcode had to deal with that. ü§£
---
Every now and then the net would get attacked by mirelurks, fog crawlers and hermit crabs.
---
Ps4
---
early game low level doesnt get any better than Leader of the Pack..
---
Beckett was dropping a grumper. If he‚Äôs your ally, he‚Äôll talk about it sometimes. One of his lines is something along the lines of ‚ÄúI hope nobody decides to drop a nuke while I‚Äôm dropping a grumper‚Äù. One of the funnier things I‚Äôve heard in the game. Of course I had to google what grumper meant before I knew what he was referring to.
---
Still a low level but I went to a camp near mine and bought a plan for something simple only like 50 caps or something like that emoted with the owner and I moved on and was happy out. I was fighting away when I got a notification that said player bought everything in my vendor which was worth maybe 3000 caps, and it‚Äôs not like what I had was good either, had a level 45 gauss rifle and a level 50 auto rifle along with some grenades and purified water.
---
Now as for paying it forward I haven‚Äôt done anything as of yet but I‚Äôm building up a stockpile of stimpacks and water so I can help out low levels.
---
Now I'm sure this is a yes..but you do have the backpack from finishing the scouts right?
---
From Hartford personally but CT is still CT I guess
---
It's habit now to check suitcases at train stations because you never know what someone will drop. So much ammo and plans.
---
I think you might have seen AngryTurtles video about it few days ago...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU1tGnO5TXA
---
They release an item you have to pay for in the shop this week, and next week when the pass comes out a recolor is in the pass that is "free".
---
No I don‚Äôt think so as first you have to get an asylum outfit to drop via that chart and then 95% are dirty, so far better odds to get them at the Asylum.  I have more than half the asylum outfits and all I have ever gotten off that chart is dirty, never a rare.  That said, statistically it is possible, just worse odds
---
It‚Äôs not that rare from the Riding Shotgun event‚Äîbut not a lot of players grind events enough to get the plans they drop. As such, it‚Äôs not really rare, but still has value.
---
if you're looking for scrip hit up the horde quests when they pop up. quick and easy. and if you get low level armour some of it has value for mules
---
Upvote for effective use of spamming
---
perfect for scrip as well
---
AWOL armaments and riding shotgun both have at least 1 legendary spawn so make sure to do those when you see them
---
I‚Äôve got all except red and it‚Äôs maddeningüòÇ
---
Damn boi-
---
(Nice username by the way, lol)
---
It was patched afew updates ago i think
---
Wastelanders... I had fun with it, for half a day. Then the grind set in, AGAIN.
---
"Fallout 76 doesn't have NPCs"
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that make any gun with the perk a legacy?
---
I think it was survival tents for settlers and raiders when Wastelanders dropped. Could have been something since then but nothing major.
---
What vendor is that as I would have noticed or is it random in apparel and you just need to check?  That would be new news.  I found one and have bought one for $8k which at the time was cheap for one of my characters.
---
It was patched so it now works as designed. Items still drop with that legendary effect.
---
It was patched as in it works now. So no that would not make them a legacy.
---
No it used to not work right but they fixed the effect so it works now u can still get the 250 drwr on weapons
---
I just want the encapsulated scorchbeast heart....
---
There are actually 3-5(I want to say 4, but not sure) locations spread across the map that Motherlode can warp you between. I noticed it while running the Settler questlines when I clicked on "Her" once and was given an option of locations to transport to. I haven't gone back to see if it still works since I ran the raid with the Raiders so Motherlode is still alive for me.
---
Ok that makes much more sense thank you
---
What system are you on? I‚Äôve been building a character on Xbox designed for helping boost level gain speed - it helps to always do feed the people and have the wanderer in your camp for +10% Exp gain along with sharing rank 3 inspirational for a +25% exp gain speed
---
Yeah it would be good so an infinite food source isn't so easy to keep producing food.
---
Sadly I have gotten in the habit of checking. But when I see empty ones at common travel points, I do try to drop some ammo or whatnot in them, just for someone else to have the joy of finding something there!
---
Did we get some skins too, that colored paint as well or something for armor.
---
wot
---
What if we were comparing the Cash versions of both?
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. A couple of armor paints. I think for scout armor and one other.
---
I had to get the whole bundle of bullshit for that heart. Worth it though
---
It's mostly jokes for the vids sake
---
I didnt even know the motherlode could do that. You just go to the basement of the estate building and talk to her or something? Then the game gives you the option of fast traveling with her to somewhere?
---
Latest was some Atomic camo skins for armor pieces. Like wood armor was one, but who uses wood armor? Even newbs don‚Äôt use them since they can craft light leather straight out of Vault 76.
---
Pirate build!
---
I was taking a break from the game when that came out
---
Seasons is free bethesda said so and if they don't keep their promise well this community is a powder keg
---
Not if the items are not of interest to you? I like the camp items/skins in this battle pass more than i like anything we've recently gotten from the atomic shop
---
See people like you who make this defence are right but you miss the main point people have about this wave of everything being time limited seasons which is it changes the game to being a game you play when you feel like it to being one you feel you have to play or else you'll miss things.
---
Also you don't factor in that 99% people playing each of these games with seasons in also want to play the other games that also have seasons or even games that don't have seasons (shocking I know)
---
It's one of my favorite ways to unload ammo I don't need.
---
Unyeilding so you never get seen and have insane crits In vats
---
just imagine if the BoS had put a single PA USER with a minimum at the airport  all of them would be alive and cooperating with bos with out questioning
---
They stack so beautifully.
---
do you got the plans im asking about
---
Yes for people who aren't running a shotfun built
---
I have the barrel learned.
---
\*Capsforfaps\*
---
Coming to a store near you-
---
do you got plans??
---
So what level should I do this quest  because I am level 35
---
Man, I just busted out laughing at work and almost got in trouble....LOL
---
nah but thanks
---
Yep exactly, if I remember correctly just click "E" on her and pick a destination.
---
Edit: The locations are I believe a little out of the way, like the one in the Mire is way up in the NE past Freddy's House of Fears. However if you don't like fast travel for whatever reason they can be a legitimate travel means(with no caps required).
---
Which outfits are worth saving?
---
Didnt the Bos fall by then? Fort defiance fell before the responders, if I'm not mistaken.
---
I do like both. Sons of the Pioneers was earlier than the Cash version too, so closer to what the songwriter intended.
---
What a biased and one sided post. You talk about what Bethesda promised as far as monetization goes but leave out the parts where they nickle and dime the playerbase.
---
First let's talk about the fact Pete Hines himself said atom shop will only be cosmetic. Now we have a borderline P2W tab disguised as "utility". The gains on it meager, but it's the precedent that is worrisome- because they take an inch now and in a few months they take a mile.
---
And you're thinking i'm wrong, but that has already happened. Repair kits hit the "utility" tab and next thing you know people are avidly defending them saying they aren't a big deal. Fast forward a few months we get fallout 1st.
---
Did you forget about fallout 1st OP? You know the $13 a month for basically the ability to store junk items. You know how absurd that is, to pay $13 a month just for basic industry standard quality of life features.
---
And i fault no one for not buying atoms, half the stuff released on the shop are just recolors and reskins. The other half are broken and plain don't work. And they apparently don't play their own game cause they never release stuff that's meta. Let's keep releasing skins for guns no one uses. Also i find it hilariously hypocritical of you to talk about this stuff when you yourself is hoarding 27k atoms for god knows what.

This makes no sense and shows a deep disconnect with [how the majority of video game consumers behave](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2018/#:~:text=KEY%20FINDINGS-,GAMERS%20SPEND%20SIX%20HOURS%20EACH%20WEEK%20PLAYING,play%20seven%20or%20more%20hours.). Even Bethesda targets the demographic most likely to fill in gaps with atom purchases which just so happens to be console casuals and pc casuals in that order and designs daily content around minimal daily time input that reward consistent short daily activity (have you ever asked yourself why the dailies take 10-15 minutes to complete max, and why scrip and bullion are limited to daily purchases with tiny maximum caps, and the season pass takes 1-2 hours per level?). There is not at this point another 150 hours of fresh gameplay loop in this game for people like me and I would argue for anyone as the main story + wastelanders can be done in 25-40 hours. This is why super hardcore players like myself who have hundreds of hours (I am at around 900) and many others are deeply frustrated and starting to burn out in droves (its getting real hard for me to find the motivation to keep logging in). Bethesda knows our demographic exists and are very vocal, but they are incapable of generating good content that keeps us busy because that costs HUGE development investment for little return (in their eyes which is why we got the atrocious unplayable vault raids last year that are now gone and haven't been replaced and probably wont) when they can be doing what they are doing now AND generate more revenue.
---
So what do they do? Maximize revenue from casuals, string along veterans and eventually you end up with a shit system where both groups are unhappy and alienated (except for the newest group of new players who probably came in with wastelanders/steam and haven't yet learned that big daddy b does not have your interest as a subscribing player at heart. Their priority from the beginning is cash money and always has been. It is really that simple. 
---
In addition, video games are a form of entertainment and subject to too much of a good thing, and there is a very healthy body of evidence that supports the position that sitting in front of a computer for hours doing anything is harmful to you both physically and psychologically. It also entirely ignores that most functional adults with families and relationships DO NOT spend hours a day playing one or even one of several games. A close friend of mine just had a baby and hes lucky to see 20-30 minutes of gaming a day if any and he was previously a pc master race type gamer. 
---
&gt; And if you're playing multiple games, it completely voids any complaint you might have about not having enough time to gain levels in the season. You're actively choosing to spend your free time on a different game.
---
This is based on the assumption that the grind is reasonable and the pricing is reasonable and that this system is comparable to any other season pass system in a comparable triple a game which is for sure not the case. Can you even google around and find me a triple a game with a microtransaction shop AND a season pass that charges anywhere near what Bethesda is asking for with this? Even COD with their season pass is not as greedy and that is fucking Activison. I play a number of games with very reliable and actually fun season passes where you can see where the revenue is being created but not at the cost of players having fun. When done well a season pass system is beneficial for both parties. This is not that.

scolds the community because we arent forgiving of bethesda greedy practices and tells us atom shop purchases support game development. all the while hoarding 27000 atoms. what a fucking joke and a hypocrite.

I will have enough script to buy my SS armor tomorrow.  I only have 10 modules so now its time to grind for those.  The question is I have a full set of unyielding 3\* with different weight reductions, do I really need to buy SS?

That and the high capacity mod.  Made it my mission to finish up a number of actual possum challenges.  Just got high capacity the other night and now I want to officially rank up into Possum with the uniform, so Scout Leader Pompy will stop saying such disparaging things to me.
---
You're buying atoms by purchasing Fallout 1st. And I see A LOT of 1st subs on the map when I play or launch queen nukes. This argument is invalidated by merit of 1st atoms, and those guys complain because they've got the atoms but the atomic shop doesn't supply anything for them to use those atoms on.
---
Yes. I always carry what I call my "forest weapon" that I use in low level areas and events like these to avoid oneshotting everything. That this courtesy isn't widespread among such a friendly player base blows my mind.
---
Bakersfield would be a little south of Necropolis in Fallout 1
---
Yet in FO4 you had to decide which faction to side with and it affected the rest of the game. So you create more than one character. It‚Äôs kinda the same except this is online.
---
If you‚Äôre spending money on atoms you should be buying 1st, it‚Äôs cheaper long term and gives access to private servers
---

Exactly, that way people will have a completely different path to take when doing Wastelanders, allowing for a second play through without it getting too stale.

Or let you know you've accidentally left your mic on... üôä
---
Still would suck
---
Nope, their corpses, ashpiles, goo piles work too. As long as it registers their name in the corner when you look at it through the camera, it counts.
---
Well they're not exactly lost, I've come across workshops that someone else had built then logged out. The stuff was still there, so when I claim the workshop, I don't have to spend resources on it, except to repair what's broken.
---
It does when you want to wear a status symbol sometimes. Whip out whatever is the rarest item in your wardrobe and parade it around.
---
It is just bragging rights so you're not wrong but it's still nice to have rarer things even if you can't trade them.
---
Not since the game first came out
---
Ahhhh, well done!
---
She is level 400 and I am like 315 and this caught us both off guard :D some of them were diseased too
---
They could just get rid of the scrip limit and instead limit how many rolls you can make per day.  No more overflowing stash
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and have one
---
Accidentally put my main weapon into the sbq corpse while spamming buttons to loot her - someone got a very nice combat shotgun that day.
---
Fortunately it was months ago, so I have better gear now anyway xD
---
I only shoot animals in self-defense, or for food.
---
I actually feel a little sad when my Plaquewalker accidently kills a cat....
---
Not sure what your problem is? I‚Äôm on Xbox and my vending machines are ***super kawaii***.
---
Seen that and seen all liberators, each only once and can‚Äôt recall the circumstance
---
Way better than being useless
---
Yeah brotherhood fell first, they tried to attract all the SBs with the sinar equipment,  and use it as a kill zone. August  19th brotherhood fell, November 7th the Morgan town airport fell. Although relations were already bad, due to the environmental work, and the brotherhood threats. So it's unlikely the responders would have allowed the bos near the airport.
---
Yeah, it's been a long time since I have seen it. Sometimes you can find a legends one too. I'm guessing they are all level 1's?
---
I don‚Äôt have an extra copy but I can build one for ya if you‚Äôd like?
---
I believe it's the "clean up crew" after a nuke zone expires
---
I exit my power armour before entering my house every time, I also change clothes when I‚Äôm tinkering so my sheepsquatch outfit doesn‚Äôt get dirty. The wasteland is a messy place, why bring it home
---
Thanks for the tips..
---
I have designed three characters after my kids and answer questions and do quests with how I think they would respond. For example, my oldest is a scrappy, crazy boy, and it shows in the dialogue choices I make with that character (He kept all the gold to himself for example). My middle is my sweet and kind daughter. She only wears pink and split the money with both factions... Just some basic stuff like that.
---
Haha üòÖüòÅ
---
The best way to improve them is make it so if any player has a mortar in range and you throw a marker for it the closest mortar fires, so at least if you don‚Äôt use it there‚Äôs a reason to place one down
---
I thought so.  I was certain I had more than that thing was showing.  I hate to use the term bugthesda, but when it fits, it fits.
---
It's not fair and you're right in feeling bad about it cause you got robbed by scum. I die after a SBQ fight and guaranteed someone's taken the flux I just earned. It sucks. Got to find a way to move on and if you do let me know how to also. :P
---
Well at least you didn't do it 8 times, I did get a JE25 handmade for one before they patched it tho
---
So they don't or haven't mentioned how well it was doing. I wasn't implying anything, just asking if there was official wording to this and not just theories or assumptions on how well the atomic store was actually doing.
---
I only got 1 rare, but I did find just one of those, no extras though either
---
I like fallout 76, on November 19th I will like Cyberpunk 2077 more. I agree with you! I came with the wasterlanders dlc, I stayed away from this game until that point. I thought it was getting better, but I think I will be more on and off with this game from now on. But one can still be hopeful!
---
Same!!!
---
Seriously, I would wait until I got the countdown timer, log off then rejoin buy joining the recent tab. Then run around and make stable flux
---
let's for a sec say that the brotherhood hadn't hit the protectors for supply, I have a high hope that protectors and responders would be there to help them end the SB, couse you know they died protection people at the airport would be the same thing. yet I don't agree with the brotherhood taking what they want hurting people just for the sake of the mission, even on the ps2 game they say to not mess with the civilians or engage them in combat wile you gather information on the first camp.
---
no he wasnt
---
Isn‚Äôt the clean US flag a tadpole buy at the scouts?  Never seen it drop but I know I bought mine there.
---
(Image mine but) I have a floating camp that looks just like tha flying off the cliff over whitesprings, called the prydwen! Full of BOS memerobila and even  gift ashop (completely unrelated to the other prydwen camp over a similar spot on YouTube, that guys way better at camp building than me)
---
I dunno about wayward, but theres a ludicrous number of carrot flowers at the palace of the winding path
---
You have a fair point, given the circumstances, they should have worked together. It may not have saved them, but they could have deffiently taken more of the schorched down.
---
It's massive and takes up a lot of budget. I was a little disappointed to be honest.
---
Dying was the fun part, other low levels were looking at me, a low level with very good gear, i was approaching them telling them while coughing that i dont feel well and spamming the r button to die,you should see the reaction they had!!!, some where looking around if someone shot me and other were running away .
---
This isn't bad for someone like me who can't quite do West Tek yet. How often do you think you see legendaries on this run?
---
Havnt seen an airship in the wild in some time. Nice!
---
At least with a skin on my Bloody Fixer, people will stop offering to buy it!  Changed the name to NOT 4 SALE and they still ask for it!
---
My 2 favorite spots are the Cranberry bog and Mire.  
---
For the Bog just make a huge circle around the perimeter hitting all the locations.  You will find a lot of legendary creatures just doing that.  By the time you get back to the start they will reload.
---
The other is the Mire.  Start at Freddy's House of Fear and take the main highway south to Generals Steakhouse and Robco. Lots of possible locations all along the road.
---
Much more interesting than always running Westech.  I don't like Whitesprings that much unless its nuked.  Otherwise half the ghouls are under leveled and don't drop max level stuff.
---
Just take a RAD-X to suppress your mutations temporarily.  Then see if the problem improves.
---
I run talons instead of twisted muscles.  I can't live with the damage reduction from TM.
---
I have seen it a couple times. No idea what causes it.
---
Theres a cooking station out in the lot, too. Makes the glowing meat weigh a little less and you can sell it at WS too
---
OK that's actually pretty funny, good on you for having fun with it!
---
I hope that there will be challenges around stuff we want to do and that is doable, the current ones are terrible.  Less placing 15 lightbulbs and more killing enemies
---
I've never seen it myself, but there have been sporadic posts from players who have. So, yes, it can happen, but the drop chances are almost as bad as in Fort Defiance, and FD is far more efficiently farmable.
---
I thought it would be cool to have a Fallout game in Virginia Beach, only problem is with all the military, it would look like the glowing sea.
---
thank you for seeing the point, now I need,  make my friend see that too, btw did you payed attention to the enclave? I was half sleeping when I did it
---
I hear you, it's total crap.  I purposely shoot it once and wave for people to come over and still a lot of time the next person comes and kills it and I am like wtf.  Or even better the people who join uranium fever and really don't help at all and then kill the legionaries before anyone else can get there.  It's not hard to carry a shitty pistol so everyone gets a chance.
---
I scrapped two scout masks in beta. The first one was intentional for aiming to learn plans... That wasn't going to happen. The second was me not paying attention when scrapping armor and clothing. I has the sad's now.
---
It's still a pretty significant penalty even with class freak. It increases the actual spread of the bullets which can really case your DPS to suffer at long ranges.
---
I run tm with my instigating power fist does insane dmg it doesn‚Äôt really effect my gravy‚Äôs badly seeming as they are spam weapons that have good bullet spread
---
Yes, I also have seen chinese robots.  Freaked me out the first time.
---
I have seen some for 3-5k in vendors. Its all supply and demand my friend!
---
The only advocating going on was you advocating for people lacking self control to not use the internet, and if that was the case, no one would be on the internet. I didn't say anything previously about removing your consumer choice, that's a narrative you invented.
---
That being said, there are definitely people being taken advantage of and I don't understand why you can't see that. 
---
You think people should have self-control and take responsibility for their actions - absolutely, no one is saying otherwise. But that doesn't mean people are infallible (otherwise exploiting, conning, or taking advantage of people would never work), and when you have a company pouring millions into trying to find ways to take advantage of people, to capitalize on their weaknesses, and exploit them as much as they can, that's not only predatory, but it's also going to be effective - which is exactly why they can justify putting vast amounts of money into it. 
---
It's the same reason you have laws that prevent cigarette companies from advertising openly or in anyway that may appeal to children, or limitations on gambling advertisements both by age and requirements providing information on how to deal with addictions. Hell, it's the Best Buy rep trying to up-sell to the elderly customer who doesn't know any better - what all of these have in common is that they depend on taking advantage of people in order to exploit their weaknesses for monetary gain, and gaming (of the video variety) has been heading in the same direction for years, with Fallout 76 and Seasons being another shining example.
---
It has nothing to do with consumer choice, it has everything to do with preying those of us who are most vulnerable - and there's nothing wrong with expecting better than that and trying to protect people from that kind of slimy bullshit. 
---
If you're so concerned about consumer choice then challenge companies to do better, to not take the lazy way out (rehashing old assets again and again), that's how you're going to get real choice and innovation, when companies actually have to work for your dollar.
---
Yep, this was my fear as well.
---
I'm at ally rank with both factions right now.  I really wish they had made it a scale, meaning more rep with one side lowers rep for the other. Just makes no sense currently.
---
If they were intent on keeping it this way it should have been 2 groups in the same faction instead of what we got.
---
I think being locked out of certain bullion plans is fine if you side with one group.  If you wanted both sides to be friendly you could work for both but not tip the scales with the max ally rank never being available unless you completely side one way or another.
---
What?? I have Beckett and I have never heard this lol. I have a porta potty set up, do I need a real toilet instead? Do I need to leave the door open lol? I have never heard this or seen him use the toilet lol.
---
I feel ya, we had no idea what is happening either üòÅ
---
One way I feel like the guy from road to perdition, the other way I feel like NatGeo. Depends on the build story.
---
I missed an opportunity to get a picture of some random nocturnal sitting in the porta potty at my camp. I would have loved to have gotten that. Ms. üí©
---
This.
---
I got mine from a player vendor junkie's +1S and something else, 728 caps.  Made me happier than shit to get that shovel ( I am a junkie build).  Now I never have to worry.  Congrats!
---
I never pick up loot at NPC locations. Feels like stealing. (Yeah, I'm looking at you clipboard and fan in the Overseers house!)
---
Yeah, I'd always let myself die of rads when I did it. Seemed like you always got a mutation doing it that way so it was pretty quick
---
Had an npc run by me screaming his head off being chased by a chicken. So, I shoot the chicken and he thanks me and tells me he is deathly afraid of the things.
---
It came as a broken game, it is still a very broken game, they dont deserve profit. We cant make it normal for companies to give us broken, half asses "games" for full price.
---
I am roleplaying as an Enclave Operative (not too hardcore but I make an effort). I always wear my Operative Underarmor, My Thorn Scout Armor, or my Officer's Uniform (I have an idea for a third uniform when seasons comes out with the release of the Enclave Beret), nearly always use energy weapons, and I also do not use mutations, I get rid of any radiation ASAP, and don't eat anything human/feral (cannibalism etc). I also make a point to do any Enclave Events I come across.
---
Considering how the queen can go down in 30 seconds with meta builds attacking her, I feel that she needs a massive buff. Immunity to being crippled is just the first step in making her an actual boss fight and not a legendary farm for power gamers who have only their vendor sales in mind.
---
drugs, adrenaline, optimize your build and u have no problems.
---
That‚Äôs what I do as well, I carry an uspecced pipe rifle so I don‚Äôt one shot.
---
The badge reward doesn't always register so check your collection tab. In fact they never used to register so you always had to look after doing an event for Ever Upwards.
---
My luck with these goes in streaks. I will get 2 per day and then none for a week.  Just how it goes.
---
Curious to know if the robot will address you differently depending on what you wear.  Many of the Responder bots react differently when you have their gear on.  I have gotten every tadpole challenge badge and possum badge and he still makes disparaging comments to me. Lol
---
I had a weird fight going on at my camp. Beckett and all my turrets going to town on Sage. Since Sage is unkillable, they were just shooting at him for like 5 minutes, and I'm talking to Sage during all this and he's all happy like he's super doped out
---
I could see east Tennessee and western North Carolina being in an expanded map. It is where uranium enrichment was done for the first nuclear weapons.
---
Sorry I didn't get notified! I'll add you once I move!
---
oh shit, really? so maybe power armor shotgun builds are not that great?
---
Just fix the stupid rubberbanding damage bug and reduce the severity of the damage dropoff from range, maybe add an Armor Piercing card or something, that's all they really need.
---
I didn‚Äôt feel bad when I picked up 100k..
---
So Pompy is just short for pompous.  Good to know.
---
Every northman I encountered last night didn't move and was bugged got alotta good pictures out of it though
---
I usually use my terrible Tesla so even if I miss auto aim has my back üòé
---
I'm throwing you an upvote because I agree.  The FO1 "Rewards" have been pretty much the scraps that nobody else wants.  Reskinned tents over and over, plus Wood rainbow puke armor paint.  Fallout 1st members pay a lot toward new content for 76, you'd think they could throw us a little bone worth having every now and then.  I get that the bonus atoms allow me to buy many things from the shop, but I can't help but feel a little cheated.  I won't give up my scrapbox and tent though, so I guess I am contributing to the problem.
---
Accidentally scrapped a legendary shotgun and a legendary combat knife.  I had atom paint jobs on them and when I went to drop I destroyed them.  I was bummed but thank Todd they weren't god rolls. Lol
---
As an aside to this, photographing a non-hostile Mothman pisses it off! Even while being sneaky, took the snap shot, then the fight was on!
---
Lol if they weren't cheating to begin with I probably would tho
---
Same. Thank god the outfits don't weigh much. Lol
---
First time I played, still used to Fallout 4 workshops, take the one at the junk yard, guy comes up drops a 1 Star axe and cranberry relish (robot never has that one) stuck around and helped with waves of liberators. I was passing by the responder church and dropped a cranberry cobbler for a guy told him what is was. I also think some things are too expensive at vendors, camp is north of the ammo factory, I keep prices low.
---
The Killing Floor has been used a lot. I have seen them with platforms for heavies to stand on while the melee players work the floor
---
Where will you be when diarrhea strikes?
---
Just another excited customer.
---
 I‚Äôm gonna nuke your\* camp
---
I just dud a quick test of that and it does help. Though I dont want to get to that because scally skin and marsupial help me a lot.
---
the fallout 1st rewards are around once a month.
---
This month reward (still active to claim) was a ugly yellow/orange paint for the [Wood armor](https://i.gyazo.com/83d59b4c519cb2c985c8913afd1d7991.png) and the [Forest/Urban Scout armor](https://i.gyazo.com/91195303a9569ec6d8cf8c71c105457b.png) and the last month was a [desert paint for the Ranger armor](https://i.gyazo.com/b89783b7f54f8ca2d3ec0587c8711038.png).
---
This^
---
It was talking about Nashville and Graceland but again dont get your Hope's up this is all hear say and rumor
---
Hell yeah dude ! I'm working on the secret service set on one character and the t65 on another, don't have much time to play but it gives you a goal to shoot for during endgame
---
Never thought of that but it fits!  Pompous ass. LOL
---
I love the sound the shovel makes when it hits.
---
You know what? I'll take it. I can agree to him being 5/100.
---
Gosh,  the work you up in to compiling that.  Hats off to ya M8. Really appreciate you sharing.  It will be very useful. üòÄ‚úåüèº
---
I always wear a wedding ring (married IRL tho I can‚Äôt get my wife to play), and I never loot if there‚Äôs someone scavenging nearby
---
I don't use scaly skin, but marsupial isn't breaking anything that I am aware of if that helps you.
---
I try not to kill fellow marsupials (opossums)
---
Got me several of those magic shot guns and I can tell you a level 50 SB is toast when it lands.  you just got to get up close and personal.  Got a J limb 25, J25/25, J33+1A (all combat) and a quad 33 Gauss which is a freaking beast.  I bring my quad to fight the queen and it does a real nice job.  Use the other shottys for the hoards at the queen fight.
---
time to stock up on 40mm
---
or not
---
man this is making me do maths. BOOOOOOO!
---
To the opposite of this, I went to do the Mad Dog Manhunt yesterday. I've just gotten to level 50, but it was close and wanted the event XP. A level 123 shows up and I could tell he was trying to get 1 melee hit on all the supermutants so I could get XP too. Then to my shock and surprise, I turn around and he's lying dead on the ground. He didn't even wait for me to Stim him, just rezzed. I decided to avenge him by pulling out my 'serious' gun (50 cal) and kill them all as he respawned for the reward. I think he was embarrassed because he punched the downed Mad Dog once, then ran away!
---
Nope
---
The problem isn't free atoms losing them sales. It's a multifaceted issue:
---
* Stupid, cringey stuff that is far more applicable in a kiddie game like Fortnite, not a parody of cold war ear 1950s. Yes, I want bright orange and yellow "camouflage" for my metal armor. Sounds great.
---
* So many areas that lack actual options that would sell INSTANTLY such as ceilings for CAMPS, building sets (we've gotten only ONE post launch wall style) and stairs. Oh stairs, why are you so bad?!?!
---
* Pointless reskins - Sure, we'd love another slight recoloration of a PA skin, ranger armor (1st) or $8 pack for 3 primary colors on PA. Cool.
---
* Lack of skins for most weapons - all of the whizbang new gauss weapons got a sweet skin (though there are bugs with them) but poor ol' gauss rifle remains blank to this day. What about The Fixer? Why can't it use the combat rifle skins? So many easy to fix oversights here.
---
* Broken items - How hard it is to TEST to see if that shiny new stair clips into the wall and doesn't stack properly with any other stair (including itself)? Or clothes that clip into player models? Or bags that clip into the ground (paratrooper)? Or prefabs that have wildly unpredictable no build areas (all of them)?
---
* No mother forking CAMP budget upgrade since launch! - Even on private servers (as was originally a "coming soon" selling point for 1st). There are things I would have liked to have gotten but didn't bother since I'm always at max with even a modest build.
---
* Absurd budget issues for certain things - Dovetails into the last point... while you could make the argument for display cases needing to have a high enough budget to discourage insane item spam leading to a heavier rendering load (since the game doesn't do any meaningful culling), what about magazine displays? Make it so that if you put in a certain threshold of items into one, that it's filled out? That way you can have enough models to cover the standard distribution of magazines and not have to sacrifice 25% of your budget to use them all.
---
* Zero communication when things ARE fixed - People might have jumped to get the new and improved garden dome thingy when it came out with a version that didn't have to be glitched onto a building (aka one without a foundation). I don't recall a single mention of it. Though to be fair they broke the door mount and it took months to fix. Same thing with the super overly wide and broken vault stairs... there's a much slimmer version that stacks properly with other stairs now, but nothing said.
---
* Price - Ugh, where to start. A PA skin is not worth $18. Red Rocket stairs is not worth getting a garish diner set I don't (which contains at least one broken item) just for a single item that is only available in a bundle. The prices are absurd and would be a better fit with a f2p game with no upfront cost.
---
It all comes down to fatigue. Too many truly silly things, too many repeats or reskins, lack of meaningful options for so many items and completely non-existent QA (shocker). Not to mention the insane price point for most of these.
---
It is a random spawn. I have found this vendor three different times in the small NPC camp by the river between Slocum's Joe and the Wayward. Bought the Long Coat each time and sold it for 5k each time as all my characters have one in their inventory. 
---
I used to farm them off the Responders Bot, but now I check here often for them.
---
Seriously, a downvote already?  You must really enjoy your laser rifle and sledgehammer skins.
---
yea it is and im fucking lazy
---
No I have no armor on besides the power armor
---
Yup, like EA trying to get the gambling law on lootboxes overturned saying "It's a feature!"
---
Thanks I'll try that
---
Nuke deez nuts.
---
I always have a wood armor set with shrouded mod on it for when I want to play stealth.
---
*worthless nuke (comma)
---
Another solid reason for sure, sorry stranger but this took a lot more than caps to get! Don‚Äôt know if you were aware, but only you can see the nicknames on your stuff. I‚Äôve had my buddy catch a name or two when the trade screen is first loading, but otherwise it‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúBloodied _____ Fixer‚Äù to them
---
They really are the no-fun developers. They are so focused on making sure everyone is forced to log in daily, they miss the most important aspect of the game which is to have fun. Seasons was my last hope for something new, but all we get is more mindless grind.
---
With players using broken builds like the guide mentions, non-power gamers are s o l in getting enough damage to get rewards off her. Hopefully Bethesda will balance things out and make the Queen a powerful enemy like she once was that takes more than a minute to defeat.
---
After Wastelander there is another traveling merchant that sells one. I have found her three different times in the NPC camp above Wayward by the river.
---
greggmason920 4 president 
---
he gave me the plans for the fixer, for free
---
I actually found this out the hard way recently, haha. It was a Vengeful Mothman of all things, too.
---
Upvote!
---
Or just make it so everyone who lands a hit at all gets the reward, like any civilized mmo!
---
I have a mule character just to hold outfits.
---
I thought it was well-done. It even had a vendor trap.
---
The cryolator is a good tool to slow her down.  I wish more people used it.
---
I‚Äôve never purchased any, or used any of my accumulated atoms. What‚Äôs good to buy from the atom shop?
---
This is why I have barely logged in for about a month.  There is a multitude  of problems in this game, but I was furious when I saw they were going to delay the colossal problem event.  This game  is in desperate need of end game content  and  another reason to launch nukes.  I tolerated the log delay  for Wastelanders with the understanding that once it was done, there would be a framework in place. This framework would mean that they would be able to quickly roll out new content free of  bugs. Or that is how it was sold.   Of course that was pure nonsense.
---
But they sure as hell made  sure season  1 rolled out on time. Maybe because it involves monetization.  I know that monetization is part of it, but prioritizing the season crap over new endgame content is just infuriating.
---
The treasure hunter event followed by Fascnacht just somehow sucked the joy out of this game and left  me exhausted.   It was all very off putting.   Both of them were just a rehash of past events and kept you stuck in a loopy grind trying to get a better drop.
---
name checks out
---
drop  your own nuke on a spot you like to go farm or visit then and stop crying when someone drops it on a spot that they like.
---
VATS is broken not the weapons
---
Yeah they weigh too damn much so the excess just gets dropped.
---
I felt that way when I met Lou! He's from Pittsburgh, my home town. There are some settlers in Foundation that mention the are from Pittsburgh too.
---
Harper's ferry on the border between West Virginia and Maryland. Meaning that the majority of the Mire is located in West Virginia. The devs just shifted the border closer to the rest of the state.
---
Wish I had team mates that were that squared away!!!
---
I dropped about 40 3\* legendaries and 10 3\* Legacies in a paper bag to transfer them to my mule.  Poof.  Bag was still there, but inaccessible.
---
Yeah. Finally a use for .44 and 40mm
---
I paid 10k for mine and I also sell spare ones for 10k.
---
On the map for the first fallout game my County is a giant crater! And I can see the area that would be the irl location of the Los Angeles vault from the coastline on a clear day. It‚Äôs a city away from my hometown
---
If I go in with my shotty I won't use vats or I will carry  a weapon that I am not specked for like a crappy pistol, or even a crappy legendary that I picked up
---
I was really hoping for an actual Raider vs Settler choice. It would have been a great framework for a Vs. Team system. You side with one, the other is immediately hostile. 
---
It also would have been cool in the world, to be known as hostile. So the random settlers or raiders would be hostile/friendly accordingly.
---
Lol I'm far from salty you're just a troll, I also have a PC, and a PS4, I don't care about your community.
---
So have you forgotten that the game also has a subscription that pretty much every regular player uses because playing without it is a massive pita?    
---
Or that a lot of us paid 60 or more dollars for the game?    
---
Or that the justification for high item shop prices was always that you can earn atoms through game play and that that has been neutered, so the high prices are no longer justified when such a high percentage of the new stuff added to game is item shop stuff.    
---
Or that the first expansion we got after more than a year resulted in some window dressing, a pretty meh 15ish hour quest and a massive repetitive grind that litterally no one likes?    
---
I would 100% rather drop 30-40 bucks a year for an expansion loaded with all the shit they add to the item shop being rewards for new events and quests than deal with this nickle and dime bullshit.  That's just me.
---
Translation:
---
Play this game the way I want. Do not play the game they way you desire.  If you do not do what I want then I will leave my mom‚Äôs basement and cry on the kitchen floor until mommy comforts me with Cheetos and soda.
---
I think we all do. I've never seen anything like it, and honestly I was saying on comms to my friend "WTF are these guys doing? that's just a waste" when the second nuke popped up before the first had even landed. 
---
Then it all worked out beautifully.
---
Don't even scrip it.  Throw it on the ground in protest.
---
yeah but do you see the problem? it is such a misery that you literally have to watch netflix instead. If that isn't a broken game then what is?
---
 If I go in with my shotty I won't use vats or I will carry a weapon that I am not specked for like a crappy pistol, or even a crappy legendary that I picked up to add some times I just bash them with a gun butt.  Also, even if some body playing still one shots them I will not when the next comes just to prove a point.
---
**POSTING IN COMMENTS BECAUSE MY POST WAS REMOVED BECAUSE OF SOME SORT OF RULE**
---
A huge thing that Bethesda could have added to the game to make it that much better and more enjoyable, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually affect gameplay whatsoever.

Bethesda needs to add a trade window where both parties can add items to it and need to both accept to allow a trade to go through, because scamming is just too easy.
---
**NOTE** Please don‚Äôt offer me free items, the point of this post is mainly to rant and vent my frustrations. Obviously I appreciate the though of wanting to give me items but I‚Äôll just deny them, this post isn‚Äôt meant for getting free items. I know that this might get a bunch of downvotes which I assume just lowers my karma? I‚Äôm still new to reddit but I just felt like I needed to just type out my frustrations and post it somewhere and hopefully other people won‚Äôt fall into the same traps. I don‚Äôt really care about votes or downvotes, I have no idea what they are anyways, but if you do wish to continue reading, prepare for awful grammar and punctuation because I literally sat for an hour just clipping and reporting, spent like another hour telling some of my friends about what had happened, and then spent a couple hours cooking lmao to get my mind off this, and then I was back to typing up this rant. 
---
Cut up the rant into paragraphs because I was told redditers loved paragraphs, guess I‚Äôll take their advice.
---
**Beginning of the stupid rant**
---
I know this might seem like I‚Äôm looking for pity, but honestly I pity myself the most right now for being so stupid and I have enough pity already. I met this person on the discord server Fallout76 Trading Hub, I highly advise you to not trust anyone on there as the staff and management are also god awful. They probably used an alternate discord account or the staff just never bothered banning them, doesn‚Äôt really matter since you can make infinite alts. But they‚Äôve been trading in there for a good amount of time and I see that they‚Äôve traded with people and I also ended up trading with them once. 
---
Our first trade was right after they had traded away their BE fixer for a BE handmade (and probably some other items). How do I know this? Well they got the handmade off someone I was trying to trade with but they were being a little too greedy, the two also proceeded to thank each other on the discord server and then parted ways. Afterwards I got offered that BE handmade in exchange for my BE lmg, so I was like alright that sounds awesome! You have what I‚Äôve been wanting and I have what you‚Äôve been wanting. We proceeded to trade and trying my best to be friendly so that perhaps their could be more trades in the future, I offered to go first. Once they took my lmg, they gave me their handmade and also dropped me 77 stable violet flux for free. So now I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs cool, I just met another super nice high level (300+) who was quite generous and nice. 
---
About like 2-3 weeks later they ask me if they could trade for the handmade back, so I‚Äôm like sure but you gave this to me in the first place why would you want it back? They said that they needed a handmade on their other characters and offered me a BE25lvc ultracite laser rifle in exchange, we eventually negotiated and they said they‚Äôd be willing to part ways with a BE15fr regular laser rifle since I‚Äôm ‚Äúsuper nice and friendly‚Äù. So then we go trade and I ask if they could offer their items first this time since the last time I went first. I thought that we had enough trust after our first trade and also they were super high level, I automatically made the assumption that high levels with a ton of stuff wouldn‚Äôt scam because then it‚Äôd ruin their reputation and hinder their ability it maybe go for one of the more end game items like a legacy gatling plasma. This was extremely stupid of me to ever trust a random that I‚Äôve only traded once with, even if they did give free items, it was only to trick you to trust them. 
---
I know that I should know better, but fallout isn‚Äôt really the pvp type of game and I thought that maybe everyone would be friendly and help each other out since it‚Äôs pve focused. I didn‚Äôt bother looking for a courier on here because I had thought we established good trust, but also because yesterday I had tried requesting for one but never got a single response in over 24 hrs. My request was likely flooded over by other requests and it was probably my fault for not constantly requesting even though it tells me to not constantly request. But yeah, we proceed to trade and then they don‚Äôt reply to my comment about offering first this time since I offered first last time. I was a big dummy and decided to offer first, because a BE15fr laser rifle was definitely worth more than my BE+Agility Handmade so I thought it was understandable. Things went from there, they took my weapon, blocked me, left the world, and left me there as the biggest idiot ever. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting from this post honestly, I guess I‚Äôm mainly just angry, mad af, and want somewhere that I can vent. But I do apologize for anyone who did have interest in my handmade since I included it on the trade lists on my first ever reddit posts which was literally a two days ago. I no longer have this handmade and it‚Äôs now in the possession of an awful person who does nothing but play this broken game and probably scammed many other idiots like me. Obviously I saved the DM‚Äôs on discord before they could delete any messages and I‚Äôve also saved a clip of the whole thing. It was my own fault for not checking the scammer list though, because I think that they were on a couple of them (some people told me). 
---
Again, I apologize to anyone who had interest in the handmade, now I‚Äôll have to remove it from my trade list and it‚Äôll now be added on my wants list. Another lesson I‚Äôve learned and I think that everyone should follow, never trust anyone unless you know them in real life because then you could just find them and beat em up (yes I‚Äôm not joking, just look at kids who fight all the time at schools and then look at what adults do, you can literally die). Even players who you think are great friends, have given you a bunch of free stuff, and has helped you out before, this is pretty much an investment into you so that maybe one day you‚Äôd get a super valuable item and they‚Äôll scam you for it. 
---
I should know better as I have been scammed before in some other games (where there‚Äôs an item that you can‚Äôt add to a trade window, instead it could be something like a service and not a tangible item) and there‚Äôs always so many red flags. I was just stupid to think that such a small community on ps4 would mean that everyone is friendly and wants to help each other out, as well as help newcomers enjoy the game so that they can tell their friends about Fallout 76. This is probably a complete waste of time for me and anyone reading this, I‚Äôve also typed more about games than I have for my essay topics in university. 
---
But I just wanted to let everyone know that you shouldn‚Äôt ever trust anyone, and also always use a courier, even if it takes days, weeks, months, don‚Äôt ever trade your item first. I hope some people got a laugh out of this after reading my rant, even though people would probably say ‚Äúyou deserved it‚Äù because I was stupid enough to get scammed, but I also hope you understand the lesson I learned and also will prevent yourself from ever getting scammed. That‚Äôs all I have to say, and nice job if you managed to read the entire thing because I‚Äôm literally just typing this on my phone and not even bothering to reread or check anything, I‚Äôve probably got a huge amount of mistakes that I‚Äôm sure some smarty pants will point out, high fives to those people who are serious about grammar and punctuation. Plus I forgot to mention, only use trusted and verified couriers, couriers can also scam both parties and you don‚Äôt want that happening either. 
---
Back to the title though, pretty much every game with player trading has a trade window where both players can add items into the window, then both players need to press some sort of accept button and then it‚Äôll complete the trade, I think Bethesda is a bunch of buffoons for not implementing this. Not to mention duping and selling high end items for real life $$$ doesn‚Äôt help with their image. These dupe secrets could very well be from an employee and they could be secretly making thousands of dollars per month by just selling these items they‚Äôve duped. I met someone in game who was a duper, I mean it‚Äôs impossible to have like 4-5x of every high end item, atleast it‚Äôs impossible in my opinion. The duper literally told me they had over 10 ps4‚Äôs with like a ton of different accounts. It was pretty entertaining honestly because they were pretty much flexing and talking about how back in the day they gave away a bunch of these duped items and that if I ever saw one, it likely was duped by them. So yes, I don‚Äôt doubt Bethesda employees are trying to profit from this. 
---
But key takeaway I guess, don‚Äôt trust anyone, even if they are a friend that has helped you out, always look for a verified courier who has enough on their resume to back em up, and if you are trading, never offer your items first. Don‚Äôt be an idiot like me! 
---
Ps. I have a clip and everything and also know their in game name. These type of people just sicken me and honestly I‚Äôm really mad and upset mainly about how I fell for their trick and scam. I am also on PS4.
---
Have to say Palace for Carrot flowers also
---
I agree dude but the thing is...i loved the challenge! I didnt realize how much fun it was stuggling up the levels when i didnt have a clue really how to make a proper build. Now im running the standard "bloodied" build which is just...kinda boring. I wouldnt mind a brutal update on weapons/enemies. Nerf the shit outta all the op ass chad weaps, remove all the magic bullshit, tweak enemy hp pools, damage output/ai. #makefallouthardafagain
---
Honestly so many instances of people being really nice. When I was low level, a random person built me a really nice camp that I am still using today. They also made me armor. Other times random people helping on tough quests, dropping gifts, just being friendly in general.
---
My camp is near the vault, I always drop some stimpaks and ammo for the low level dwellers. My vendors are for low level too, everything is super cheap.
---
Aye. capture several low level workshops. Don't defend them and then do the retake quest. Quicker and easier
---
Had a queen get killed in the time it took to switch from my camera, just finished Photo Opportunity, to my .50 mg. Even though I was there just as she came out, I didn‚Äôt have time to swap weapons to to get a shot in. Yeah it was funny when I pulled out my weapon and it was just a camera, but damn. Less than 30 seconds for the big boss of the game to die. Shits broken and makes Scorched Earth pointless to do if you‚Äôre not using a net build.
---
They absolutely need to release a black version or the wood and steel version that is in the files (looks like the fo3 one)
---
I seriously love my plasma caster.  It is like a lever gun for heavies but faster.
---
Yeah that was due to someone abusing the god mode glitch!
---
I've noticed when Vendor hopping that the display on the map is showing some people to have working vendors (items quantities showing etc) but when I go to look at their Vendors nothing shows up. Odd bug.
---
Am I the only person who would love to see a fallout game taking place in Chicago?
---
Then stop being a Big Baby and run your own silos and drop the nukes where you want them.
---
In the meantime...sux to be you with a wet stinky nappy.
---
Only Mothman does
---
IIRC I've read where others had this problem. They fixed it by taking off the pieces and replacing the frame with a different one.  I may be wrong but you can't lose much by trying that.
---
Was bad for me earlier today.
---
Haha I‚Äôm jealous, had to server hop 7 times one day... My private server didn‚Äôt have one either too
---
Need to let people bank scrip.  Locking it to a daily limit just punishes people who can't play for hours every day.    
---
Or just drop the cash in limit, and gave a spend limit if you absolutely must have limits, so everyone can play at thier own pace.
---
Ah, I see. My mistake. No, no official word, but then there wouldn‚Äôt be if it was going badly. As I mention, though, you can look at the way things are going and make at least some educated guesses.
---
Just realized they aren‚Äôt fixed because the patch isn‚Äôt live yet. I‚Äôm dumb
---
Really? I was being attacked by a vengeful mothman when I pulled out my camera and it turned to cautious for the photo.
---
When in no rush, I'll casually walk about, taking in the scenery. I've found this works like a pseudo stealth, you make less noise when walking so enemies are much slower to react to your presence. This also makes you more aware of your surroundings since NPCs make a fair amount of noise that is now easier to hear.
---
I agree with this, my favourite being peacetohippies on twitch. Much more entertaining,  interesting and a much nicer community than the majority of YouTubers.
---
Beeeeeep beeep beep beep...
---
Yea. Just put their specific camp item in said room and lock the door. I do it for the wanderer or w/e cause she walks around and aggros stuff
---
I only do it if someone is griefing, not participating, etc.
---
Made it to Ally status with Foundation yesterday as well!!  And so glad to be done with that before the new Score system starts next week. 
---
I rolled an Instigating Gaus Shotgun.  Will be rolling more this week looking for a Bloodied.
---
Part issue is mmo so can't easily have big choices(can be done via instancing) like I would like the choice to have not infatuated the raiders and instead sick the infected on the raiders and wipe them all put like the plague they are :)
---
AND BOW SKINS!!
---
Absolute proof it's going to destroy the ammo marketplace...Not.
---
Just like the ammo maker it'll be useful to top up but certainly not enough to live off, esooif you like automatic boom sticks.
---
I agree 100%.  IF they patch out the "Magic" effect, I hope they at least fix VATS first.  The shotgun is absolute crap without magic, and VATS missing all the time makes them even worse.   For now, IMO the shotguns are balanced pretty well if you factor in the crap VATS and random huge spread that occurs no matter what rank of skeet shooter you run.
---
I run several different weapons, and don't see a huge problem with shotguns the way they are right now.  At least I am somewhat helpful in Scorched earth with magic and rapid fire.  The hacked weapons and Legacy Explosive Gatling Plasmas do more damage than I do.  
---
Hopefully, if they patch it out, they will fix the other issues with shotguns first.
---
Friend: Bro get ur dog. Me: Don‚Äôt worry he don‚Äôt bite
---
Hey consumer, did you know our FO1st subscription comes with 1600 atoms ABSOLUTELY FREE, plus with atom bonuses with our 50 dollar atom bundle you'll be rolling in the atoms!    
---
See you in the cash gra- er, I mean, waste land!
---
I would spend atoms for that
---
Have any at the moment?
---
&gt; I use that Skeeter perk
---
Lol :)
---
Have one to sell by any chance?
---
And yet I can't place a wall 2 inches into a rock face.
---
Nice! I wish someone would do that for me and drop some good stuff lol. All my gear is horrible.
---
No you are not. I‚Äôve wanted that also for a long time. 
---
Would also love to Seattle, LA, or anything on the west coast too.
---
I came in with Wastelanders, and all I want is the Responders tent skin and Elite Riot Gear Ranger skins. Why Bethesda doesn't just leave all previously released 1st content available is beyond me.
---
I get the shady business practice of "FOMO", but these aren't shop items. It's a Premium Plus/VIP service.
---
Yes, I know. The Atoms alone for paying for 1st is cheaper than buying the Atoms themselves, and all those skins, scrapbox, tent and things are basically thrown in free. But still... I really want the Responders tent without wondering if/when it will ever come back T-T
---
If only I had a definition of a worthless nuke so I know not to do it. Oh well ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Maybe I just got unlucky though! They're such mysterious creatures :)
---
I don't disagree with your main points, but I think they should just leave shotguns alone until they have fixed the other problems that you mentioned.  Obviously, fixing them properly would be the best outcome.  But don't neuter them like they have been before.
---
I agree. It's frustrating that if I play late one night, but then can only play for a few hours earlier in the evening the next, I can't complete certain things like scrapping legendaries, submitting treasury notes, etc.
---
Several times now I have essentially had to wait two days to get what is normally considered "daily" things done due to my schedule.
---
At the end of the day, it is just a game. But it's how I choose to spend leisure time because I really enjoy it. These resets can be a pain in the ass though.
---
I found it repetitive while I was adding on to my camp. But how often are people actually in camp for it to bother them this much. Like 5-10 posts a day bitching about their Ally, just fucking delete, place it down when you want to do the quest and then delete it again, smfh
---
That's actually what i do but as a Brotherhood of Steel member. See, this is what i like to see! People actually Roleplaying it out in-game instead of the 'text based rp' (Not that i have a real issue with it, it just sometimes gets a bit... to far i guess is the right word to use?)
---
Sadly i don't see many people especially on Xbox interested in Roleplaying especially in character... it sucks because i have this fantastic idea of setting up an entire Roleplay based adventure/'story' via Twitch broadcasts in-game (I hate how Twitch videos auto remove after 14/60 days [Depending on what you are on there] wish it was like YouTube where it stays up permanently. I have a big named Fallout podcaster (CHAD: A Fallout 76 Podcast) that really likes my idea/wants to see it become a reality. I'm pretty much modeling it after 'BoS - Operation: h0pe4Future' and 'New Responders 5-0' but for the Xbox side.
---
My small Brotherhood of Steel group is Roleplay/Milsim-lite focused, we even have our own actual Codex.
---
(Off-topic: If anyone on Xbox is interested in a true Roleplay group that sticks to the lore [as close as possible] while also creating its own aspects along the way, let me know, bare in mind however that the group is pathetically small at the moment (Originally had 14 members in total but a rowdy Initiate who kept asking to be promoted for a week straight [Even though he was in the group for barely 2 weeks] decided to poach 9 of them so eh) but with the Brotherhood update coming this Fall/Winter i expect that to change quickly. Now that we'll have the precursor quest a bit after Patch 20 I'm positive that'll change immediately.)
---
Either way i do hope the true to life Roleplayers actually start appearing again, with Public LFGs becoming a thing on Tuesday I'm sure the Roleplayers will slowly start to pop up.
---
That explains why I saw a lot of new guys today, and I was selling ammo like crazy at my camp I'm Helvatia. Might have to make a bunch of modded lvl 20 fixers for the guys to buy when they get that high.
---
I also find it hilarious that OP saved 27k free atoms but we the community should fork over our real money for the very things he thinks are not worth his free atoms, almost as if the Atom shop's real problem is lack of quality goods.
---
i tried and they can teleport through walls. maybe you can pull it off with some trickery but all my attempted ended in failure. I just redesigned my camp to work better with wandering.
---
Yep ok bud.
---
Everyone's moved on now.
---
It's just how it is in all games really.  There are three kinds of gamers, 1) defend developer at all costs, 2) criticize developer at all cost, 3) Try to be objective supporting the good and criticizing the bad.
---
Well the handmade skins weren't there in the beginnd it took forever until the first came
---
Not exactly = semantics.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
---
Oh okay thanks for answering my question.
---
Considering the fire rate, I think that a couple shots to take out a landed scorchbeast or being able to hit for about 100 damage on a close to the ground or landed queen isn't too  OP.  I hope that is still a possibility once the dust settles on this magic effect bug.
---
Semantics, again.
---
I'm just guessing hear cuz no one really no but from what it says you can earn ranks just by earning exp so if I had to say it wont be necessary for pve players to play nw or vice versa
---
Polk
---
I am on Xbox! Bearcano is my gamer tag fee free to invite me anytime!
---
Epic.
---
*How dare you*
---
From personal testing, it works like I described. There was an older thread around here that someone showed some very detailed tested they did and found this hour along with the caps of 20/25.
---
Sounds like a cool idea. I do similar things. It really makes the game more engaging imo.
---
Your character and camp disappear when you log off.
---
Dying:  you drop any junk items on you (materials for crafting).
---
Lengthy fights/activities: nothing of any note.  Easily re-done.
---
You can miss extended periods of time without worry.  You may miss out on some holiday events, etc, but it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
There you go. Minor relevance is still relevance.
---
LOL.   
---
You sure about that? 99% of the replies here say otherwise.
---
You only drop junk when you die. You shouldn‚Äôt lose much progress if you log off at all unless you are in the middle of a mission. Even then, a lot of them do have checkpoints.
---
Agreed!
---
The biggest thing I miss from previous Fallout and Elder Scrolls games are the companions. More specifically the banter.
---
When Wastelanders launched I was so excited to get a travel buddy who provide some commentary on events, locations, and quests. Imagine my disappointment when I found the measly 4 allies introduced were nothing more than camp decorations.
---
I know the AI has never been something to write home about. But I miss previous companions like Serena, Nick Valentine, and Cassidy. Hell, even Dogmeat contributed and all he/she could do was bark, find the occasional item, and get stuck in the world geometry. They provided context and the occasional bit of wit during travel. I miss that.
---
I carry a vamps reduced weight pipe rifle, it‚Äôs easy to find stuff like this for cheap!
---
1. Yes, to an extent. You can starve or die of dehydration if you leave for like, an hour, but the game would probably log you out automatically before that happens. 
---
2. Only junk for crafting. And it‚Äôs like Dark Souls where you can go back and reclaim it if you get there before you die again. Unfortunately, other players can also claim your junk, so if you die in a highly populated area it may or may not be there when you get back. You can stash your junk and you won‚Äôt lose it, so it‚Äôs a good idea to visit your camp every once and awhile to drop stuff off.
---
3. Quests with multiple phases do get reset to the start after you relog, but those are mostly just story quests. 
---
4. Unless you‚Äôre doing story quests or have workshops captured on your current server, yes.
---
Yes. Just a plain black skin would be awesome!
---
I go through Flatwoods frequently to remember the Responders and what they stood for.
---
I have luck at whitesprings golf club, fort defiance, the state capital building. They all have gouls. Sometimes I go in one of those and get two or three, sometimes I get none. I don't really understand it. I've noticed that the gouls have spots they always spawn at. Like this one is always at that spot, then there is always one that appears in that spot and so on. The legendaries are those same gouls, sometimes one if them spawns in as legendary. Oh I have also had some in vault tec University where you put the scorch beast dna. My theory is this. There is a small chance that a goul will randomly spawn in as legendary, so if you go to places with more gouls you are more likely to have them spawn.
---
Nuking white springs seems to produce more of them.
---
If you want events. Leader of the pack you always get there low level one stars. Like level five. They could be good to give to new players or you get nine scrip. There is always at least one at the end of one violent night and of you let it take time there will be gouls show up. Same thing with uranium fever, the longer you take the more mole men supervisors. Always one at the end of campfire tails, and the sheepsquatch at the end of the cow herding ones.
---
Also you can run into them at random spawn points. Like one star sheepsquatch or legendary whatever's. I run into them in the crowd at the SBQ, and also legendary scorch beasts at fissure sites.
---
I‚Äôm hoping one wasteland will bring that. I played ESO and it really made that game the bombdotcom.
---
I'm willing to buy cosmetics, but I'm very frugal. I am almost never willing to spend more than $5 on a cosmetic item / bundle / etc. "Wow, that's an awesome character skin, i want to use it!" If it's not between $1 and $5, I'm not going to buy it until it gets discounted.
---
I understand wanting to make a ROI, to supplement the game's income stream with cosmetics. I work in accounting, taxes, and business development. You have to recognize when the price point you're setting something at is heavily disincentivizing any purchases of it.
---
If you sell a skin at $10 each that you had to pay an artist $300 to make, you're not going to sell as many copies of it than if you priced it at $1 each. The real trick to micro-transaction activity is that if you don't put purchase price points at a "mentally insignificant" amount, people will resist purchasing it. Then, you don't sell as many copies of it, and you instinctively say "Hey, I need to raise the price of this - I'm not making enough money from the sales". However, often - especially in unlimited stock like digital items - the right answer is actually to lower the price point.
---
Think about it - at $10 I can buy one character skin, or go out to eat for lunch. I'm probably going to choose lunch, or a movie. $10 for one skin? Please. As if.
---
But at $1-$5 per skin, "Ah, that's nothing." (purchased). Then you put out another - "Two bucks? Pft, why wouldn't I?" (purchased). You keep on this trend and suddenly I've bought $10 or more of skins often with no hesitation at all as soon as you released it, instead of refusing to ever buy a single item. Now you have my $10, no real complaints out of my mouth, and I just continuously dump money into your pocket.
---
While you might ask how you're supposed to pay your artists when selling a character skin at $2 - Remember, there are *hundreds or thousands of people like me -  at least*. People that balk at $10, but don't even blink at $3.50. If most cosmetics were under $5, it wouldn't even bother me if it took two weeks of dailies to get one for free. I would just buy them, and occasionally collect a free one - if I even bothered to do the dailies.
---
I've bought two copies of this game, and I enjoy playing it. I talk it up to my friends. I still refuse to buy fallout 1st or any cosmetics outright. I see the price tag, and say no - Not at that price, bud.
---
I'm working on this. I didn't get any feedback, so I don't know if it will do any good

Ok. I'm buying a plan for a toilet now. That's so hilarious!! I'm cracking up!
---
Fuck yeah, CT representation!
---
This, I always think what if those heroes in movies  really need to take a shit while they‚Äôre fighting. It‚Äôs gotta happen at some point, right? Imagine if Captain America need to take a shit real bad when fighting Thanos.
---
I think standard for everybuild should have marsupial, speed demom, and scaly skin. If your bloodied get adrenal reaction. Then i think optional would be grounded, herb/carn, birdbones and herd mentality.
---
Borderless windowed can tank your performance
---
Cool I‚Äôll go off that and adjust as necessary thank you
---
Happens occasionally. I've seen it happen in Cranberry Bog too. Running glassed caverns full of bots is quite funny.
---
There is a spot you can spawn in where you are in an area you cannot leave but no one can get to you. Only issue is you are stuck and If the circle moves away from you, you are in trouble.
---
Dropped a BFFRLvc handmade when getting killed while in my pipboy. Oh and then I bluescreened..
---
I can see the pit stains and Cheeto dust from all the way over here.
---
Focus on vats perks to max out the damage per shot get grim reapers and and gun fu and adreniline cause your damage will be very poor at first
---
Nobody can see it except you... Sorry
---
Ok thanks, would scaly still apply if you're wearing PA? Can you get these mutations with serums?
---
Anything east of the Potomac (the river east of Harper's Ferry), is Maryland
---
It wouldn't be difficult but it would destroy a big part and grind of the game. It would be way too easy to get the weapon you want. It's still rng but still Bethesda qouls probably never implement it
---
These armor skin paints kinda bug me a little bit too.  Why would a paint be specific to a single armor type when there are so many different armor types.  Especially when it's an armor type that zero people use. . .
---
Depends on how much time you have to game in the frustration if learning the stakes and time/risk expectations of certain quests that restart if abandoned (those connected to private interiors). I find that it demands your time in chunks in a way that other fallouts never have and that this is very noticeable if your expectation is there. The game is a little more of a naked series of game loops than ever before. This also means that abandoning your current quest progress or risking junk is supposed to become inconsequential to you after level 50. If you are used to reverting to save states it takes getting used to and changes the way the game feels and where the stakes are. You can easily make a blunder that costs you a day or two of grinding in a certain area (accidentally not equipping hard bargain when buying a serum, loosing build-cornerstone gear). The format supposes that these are all joyful game mechanics and part of the thing you wanna do.
---
It‚Äôs been abandoned.  It‚Äôs just a lot more functional than survival mode ever was, so it may get a bone from time to time to promote it (like the ghille suit).
---
I‚Äôd love for this to be an ‚Äúaged like milk‚Äù comment but I doubt that‚Äôll ever happen.
---
I cannot tell the exact % but its around 5 or less. I got my first one after 50 kills.
---
Maybe lag? like a lag spike happened when launched and accidentally triggered multiple launches? Doesnt really sound intentional, cus why?
---
I am not sure it will I was on another post and somebody who has access to the PTS said it was patched.  So the other day I was doing trick or treat...the pumpkin quest and there is always around a level 50 SB.  I could do shit with it in the air.  I got my Adrenalin up with the scorched that flock to it and it landed It may have three or four shots to the face but it was dead.  Also, I am a junkie and I was high on overdrive and psycobuff.  That was my J limb 25 combat shotty.  I did pretty much the same thing with the others I have.  The Gauss shot guns are beasts the can take it down in two shots well let me say my Qaud 33 can if I have the same stuff going on.
---
&gt; trying to point out that people that likely haven't spent a dime on this game since they bought it probably shouldn't be complaining that they might actually have to start supporting it for once 
---
Um....   
---
What?   
---
Support a game by a company worth literally 2.5 billion?   
---
Maybe Bethesda should support the game?
---
Yes, but i also want those god damn raider tarps!
---
Maybe that's the angle Bethesda's working though. By giving an incentive to never forego a legendary because you want the scrip from it, people are hoarding as many legendaries as they come across and filling their stashes up. By keeping the scrip limit in place, but allowing players to accumulate more legendaries than they cans scrip on a daily basis, people might be more open to the idea of subscribing to Fallout 1st for stash management purposes. 
---
Can't say with certainty that this is the case, but it certainly seems like it!
---
Just stop logging in. Nothing is going to send a message to Bethesda except for their numbers drying up.
---
I suspect this is already happening, if [the steam stats](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/) are anything to go by. This game's player base on steam is down to a third of their high of 22000 around its release on steam. Funnily enough, it is also currently less than half of fallout 4's 24 hour high too.
---
I feel you on the Brahmin one. I had a friend that killed it. Let‚Äôs just say he has no more camp. We repaired it (me and another friend razed his house), but that was our one warning. I absolutely hate that Brahmin can be killed in camps
---
Oh yeah. Not too long ago I had a number of protectrons instead of ghouls. Diseased robots? weird.
---
Dang, people are so creative! I love this so much!
---
Here is the build I just made 
---

---
I'm not defending it but you can see how it happens at uranium fever as those things are pretty weak. However, I did free range yesterday and some nob one shotted the sheepsquatch. The sooner they fix this stupid 'magic' weapons the better.
---
I could be wrong but I believe the entire purpose of scrip being called scrip is that old-fashioned mining companies in West Virginia had their own form of currency that was usable in the old mine town called scrip that was essentially worthless anywhere else. And regardless of how much work or value of work you did you would only get the allotted amount of scrip for your shift. Or I could be completely wrong and they just used the name.
---
oh poor Bethesda (sarcasm)....
---
Solid
---
Someone cannot take being corrected very well, it seems.
---
LOL maybe Bethesda will see that there is a market for it.  Will Buy.
---
I'll give you 5 more if you get bethesda to start showing this weapon some skin love.
---
This post would scare everyone if it was out of context
---
Praise Mothman! He has bestowed his magnificent eyes upon you!
---
That would be nice. One player had a fan on or something and I kept hearing the strange, distorted whooshing sounds loudly. It wasn't them breathing as they were also talking. I just left the area. Nothing else you can really do.
---
The fact that you have that many atoms saved up is not evidence that atoms are to easy to earn but rather that the Atom Shop is and has always been severely lacking in quality content. Why would any one spend real money on the Atom Shop when you are not even willing to spend the free atoms you get?
---
You need to find better rocks!
---
Yes and yes.
---
They even said that the challenges would just be completed through normal gameplay. While NW will help advance it, it won't be required.
---
&gt;posting and not responding
---
You should have just yelled out your window.
---
Awesome, thanks üëç
---
You can get them with serums, but 50 additional DR/ER from scaly skin is almost pointless in PA because you already have both very high (diminishing returns). Grounded is a bad choice if you intend to ever use energy based guns, bird bones makes no sense - no fall damage at all in PA. 
---
In my opinion only speed daemon (faster reload) and marsupial for QoL (jumping, small carry increase) make sense, maybe carnivore/herbivore - if you can spare the 5 necessary perk points for starched genes and class freak.
---
I love wastelanders. its got great quests and stuff.
---
I'm not much of an end game grinder, i dont care about loot so much. I beat wastelanders and started playing something else than endgame grind. When i come back ill probably make a new character tbh.
---
If you get too focused on the endgame loot grind, then it stops being fun. Play something else for awhile, make a new character. ect.
---
You only will lose your junk... however if you have Fallout First you can set down your survival tent almost anywhere you can put a camp and use it to put your junk or items...
---
Imagine your life being so sad that you spend your time on the subreddit of a game you clearly hate to bash it, instead of doing literally anything else. Man that'd suck lol.
---
I dont eat cats.
---
all serum's work at all times (unless suppressed by rad-X or recently taking a serum) and every mutation can be gained by serums its just a matter of finding them for a good price.
---
pretty much everything mentioned above is good to have with the exception of grounded if you use energy weapons
---
I thought the t65 was gonna have legendary properties, boy was I disappointed.
---
I'll be running a 50 Cal with Gauss Mini, what does Grounded really do?
---
jeez. Where is that toxic working environment?
---
Just put their camp item in a room with a door and lock it, they'll be stuck in there and won't be able to teleport through the wall because they get confused by locked doors.
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
Every song ever created &gt; Johnny Guitar and Civilization
---
I like Big Iron, But I like Johnny Cash‚Äôs Version if Ghost riders in the sky just a tiny bit more.
---
Did you get banned?
---
There was a free states and vault text one if I remember right, but yes, I agree we need more.
---
There are two more maps in the game files. It has not been abandoned, I don‚Äôt know what the other dude is saying. They just added new weapons in the last update.
---
Been here since BETA. Don't hold your breath.
---
I want a SEE RICK CITY! poster for my camp, then!!
---
Yup, would like a combat shotgun skin just for a NW lol
---
Grounded boosts your energy resistance, I think by 100, but also reduces your energy damage by like 50%. You dont want grounded if you are using energy weapons.
---
Something like that won't work on a mmorpg like 76, unless they can somehow make it so that you can occasionally attack the opposing faction and somehow have a chance to get their rewards (the well, gauss stuff etc.)
---
Getting one in the season
---
I'll make periodic checks since my CAMP is up there so it's pretty quick to check.
---
One of these days I hope to have one of these moments. Even in the Fallout universe Upstate NY gets no love, lol.
---
Honestly I'm surprised, given how important Albany is when it comes to state politics, that all we ever hear about in the City. Like, I get it, that's how it is irl, but it would be nice to hear about somebody from even Western NY escaping through The Pitt to get to WV or something...
---
Seriously, no Vault near Albany? Sounds insane to me. XD I bet that's where Samuel's from, given that accents are a bit confusing to him...
---
I was told a good way to get him is to keep taking the mothman eggs to get a better chance at vengeful mothman, idk i that is true but it sounds plausible.
---
Very unique CAMP. One of a kind.
---
I‚Äôll take it
---
\+100 energy resistance, energy damage dealt -50% without class freak, -12% if you have it at rank3.  Not worth it, (small) part of the gauss mini damage is energy based.  HW/PA does fine without any mutations (5 points you can invest somewhere else), it's more a quality of life thing.
---
Luckily for you, BoS is a faction.
---
ah ok cool
---
No, unless they find evidence that you were the one who duped them you‚Äôll be fine
---
What weapons are you using?
---
You gotta bring something more than a sniper rifle. Something big and heavy that sprays a ton of lead is what I recommend.
---
Queen fights are about dps. That's damage per second, not damage per shot.
---
100% agree, i dont wanna have to deal with that
---
Very powerful , but it‚Äôs an ammo sink compared to the gauss Shotgun
---
The entire faction is hostile against you, meaning Raider/Settler NPCs will immediately attack you on sight. It only applies to those who sided against x faction. Like if I side with settlers and my friend sides with the raiders, they would be docile to him but hostile to me.
---
Biggest mistake I made was during beta someone gave me probably 6-7 explosive energy weapons and I sold or traded every single one of them, then they became legacy.... Lol story of my life
---
Yeah I just saw so many mutations based perks in people's heavy builds so I thought mutations are kind of a big deal. I think I can survive without faster reload with weight carry increased.
---
Lol, imagine if PVP *worked* and this was a thing.
---
I never knew taking the eggs can spawn a Mothman. That hasn't happened to me.
---
Exactly. It is VERY expensive to get ammo this way and slow as well. I think it is a great addition and QoL change.
---
Ha I love your copy and pasted statement if I had a cap for each time ive seen some one say this id be richer than the rothchilds
---
Thats what i was told by a friend, havent tested it out
---
Ok. Thanks. Someone gave me them, and I don't even know how to dupe
---
Same here--it's not the dogs' fault the damn Blood Eagles training them to fight.
---
&gt; that is using energy weapon perks and ballistic weapon perks
---
Maybe I'm blind or something but which are energy weapon perks?
---
Last year junkie weapons were useless because you would lose your addictions every time you died or logged out. They patched it and now junkies is one of the best classes in the game.
---
That's really cool. How did you construct that? Pictures?
---
I‚Äôm gonna build this
---
Grandpa unlocks all my doors
---
One thing to keep in mind is your 1st world will only persist for 5 minutes after leaving it (*by any method, even crashing out*) if there is no-one else on it. It was probably reset before you even restarted your computer.
---
But the whole situation really sucks... I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
There's some pretty iffy advice you're getting OP.
---
The things that are right are marsupial &amp; speed demon at a bare minimum.
---
However adrenal reaction should be a get regardless of your build. You get bonus damage even at 50% health so the harder they hit you, the harder you hit back. Also the health penalty isn't that big of a deal.
---
Aside from that, get bird bones. Only reason why you need it is because the marsupial jump height can trigger the high fall animation, which can act like a stagger slowing you down. It's annoying at the best of times but can be deadly in the thick of combat when you're jumping to get away.
---
Laser is a well known treatment option for hemorrhoids.
---
Gilman Lumber Mill just south of Vault 76
---
This will suck even more if there's a gap between seasons.
---
Top right in the war memorial
---
I‚Äôm aware which is why I‚Äôm so upset. I lost several hours of work. 
---
But now I can‚Äôt even get in. I‚Äôm able to play on adventure mode perfectly fine. Paying for a service that I‚Äôm not receiving anymore...
---
Better spot just right of sons of dane compound. Usually leave with 200-300 wood
---
Really hoping for some expansion in to Ohio at some point in DLC's. Half of my family is from that area and I used to deliver parts all around there and across the border in to Huntington and a little farther north.
---
Didn't know about those but i've got them on now, thanks a lot!
---
The hackers either die in the first 5 min or win the round, most seem to use player esp and loot esp. Havent seen any locked aimbots just assistbots as the game is too choppy/unstable for full automation hacks
---
Oh my god. So I‚Äôm not completely crazy I guess. I thought that the description was different..
---
They should change berserkers as well. That‚Äôs gotta be the worse trade off for a dmg boost in the game. I tried to roll in nothing but an unmodded military fatigue with chameleon serum and it was just too damn hard for the small dmg boost I was getting. 
---
I like the challenge of being a glass cannon but, NO dmg resistance really should be the highest dmg build imo.
---
But then I guess you wouldn‚Äôt grind armor.
---
That sucks, but you may have lost the world regardless. Can only access it for 5 or so minutes after you've disconnected. Not sure the exact limit. 
---
If you were away long enough for your PC to go into sleep mode, well, yeah. May want to adjust your power settings.
---
Even though it costs me some Settler rep (that I do need), if the Raider who stole the tech from Foundation tells me a convincing story about why they need the item (e.g. dying grandpa), I let them keep it (after paying for it, of course). 
---
Ward doesn't like it--but it's not fair for Foundation to hog all the good tech either, esp. when I arranged for the Raiders to pay recompense. 
---
I also rarely kill the Raider deserter---everyone deserves a fresh start, even if that means leaving Crater.
---
that's why I said wrong game.
---
reading comprehension, do you have it?
---
For a lot of builds mutations are great or even necessary, HW/PA not so much. Want to jump- get a jetpack, want more carry weight - get calibrated shocks. Sooner or later you will carry a large arsenal of heavy weapons anyway (bear arms, -90% weight), switching guns is usually way faster than reloading if you are in trouble.
---
If it doesn't sort out in like an hour or so, send in a ticket asking for assistance. That's the only thing I can think of..
---
What system are you on. I‚Äôve got a lightly-used bloodied, explosive, 50DR while aiming. For some good stuff I could part with it.
---
Changes your life in Excavator doesn't it? Glad to help. Now go collect more junk!
---
With 3 small children demanding my time and frequent needs to stop my game, I find it's playable still.
---
Don't stop if there are enemies nearby, but if you put your character into sneak somewhere safe/out of the way and not in a light, I've been fine to walk away for a few minutes.
---
If you have to stop more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time, just log out. The game will kick you for idling often enough after 10 minutes afk anyway, it's just a minute to log back into the game and you won't have to worry about dying. You just can't quit out while inside a building/instanced area that has checkpoints. These are usually quest locations, like Morgantown Airport (early game quest location). You lose your progress and will probably lose all the loot you've gotten if you quit while in an instance, you'll log back in outside the location.
---
If you quit out after dying, but not having gotten your death bag, you just lose any junk you had on your body when dying. Anything you've picked up that is not in the junk category (Gear, medicine, etc) stays with you.
---
Downed tress all across toxic valley.
---
The lumber yard Near 76.  Along with the woodpiles, talk to the robots.  THey‚Äôll usually provide A number of wood shards.
---
Some of the random settlers (the nes chopping wood) will alos offer to give you wood shards.  You can either take them outright, or give them a few caps in return.
---
i am not being negative in any way whatsoever
---
It sucks all the fun out of grinding for something that hackers can get in one day.
---
It's for bows only.
---
"sucks for you, maybe you should get better at inventory management so you don't find yourself in this situation" 
---
yeah, whatever you say sourpuss sam.
---
yeah, unfortunately with the same bugs as since 2013 (?)
---
Are you using the flechette mod?  The one that turns it into a shotgun?  I can shoot a corpse and get 2-5 back per shot.
---
Works for mine.
---
I have yet to get in to a single NW match, Thou I haven't waited for more than a minute for queue. If they don't have a play while in queue option its never gonna work.
---
The Prydwen has returned !
---
Gotta love how wholesome fallout 76 players can be. Came to the comments to see if the 12 year olds responded to the wood comment üòÇ sorry, the internet has ruined me.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you restarted your computer and still can‚Äôt get in?
---
Don't worry so much. There will be upgrades to it. New animation and photogrammetry. But it will still look a bit shitty and be buggy as hell. Thats also Bethesda. It would look a bit outdated and by glitchy even if they used the newest Unreal iteration....
---
Correct.
---
The Gauss mini is lots of fun, but keeping it fed is a pain - the ammo machine (also top raider rep) doesnt make 2mm, the ammo workshop also doesn't make 2mm.
---
Because 2mm was previously only used for the semi gauss rifle, its crafted in really small amounts as compared to 5mm or .50
---
Since its also a rare ammo type you dont find it laying around much, and its an uncommon drop on enemies.
---
Priming it allows you to craft more ammo, so you're not constantly farming lead/steel, but it uses crimson flux, which is used for multiple other things, making it one of the more in demand fluxes. Although you craft more prime ammo, the gauss mini still eats it like mad.
---
Oh and learning the plans for priming it doesnt actually allow you to make ultracite 2mm, you need to know the plans for primed gauss rifle in order to make the ultracite ammo.
---
Lastly, 2mm is "energy ammo" so bandolier doesnt work on it, you'll need batteries included perk to bring the weight down
---
My alt toon is a berserker and it is challenging. You gain the most damage at 0dr for 50% more damage, 1-19dr gives you a 40% bonus I think, and less and less as you go higher. Once you reach a certain threshold then the weapon will actually do less damage than base damage. I use lv 1 leathers, a shielded v as ult suit, med x and Psycho addiction. My Dr is 18.
---
Xbox
---
Sigh...
---
*Unzips*
---
No but the ammo machine may be as it's the same rep grind.  Shelved my bloodied gauss mini after only a week or so because the ammo weighs a damned ton and its spendy to produce, even when primed.  Found it much easier to make primed plasma cores when I want to do the queen or ISS for my gatling plasma.
---
Scripped a Bss+s deathclaw gauntlet
---
More common than you think.  They are more often seen in the Bog near the power station.
---
that is the only possible advice for that situation
---
And the mod database, too: [google sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311).
---
"sucks for you"
---
Ticket to Bethesda then.  Good luck
---
Ahh..no luck mate. Hope you get the build you want!
---
Free range is the worst imo. I fucking moved these cows for ages and then don't even get a decent reward at the end of it cos everyone takes it out while I'm still focused on the cows I'm trying to move/protect. Was a daily to kill a sheepsquatch the other day and the whole server got it and I never, was livid.
---
Bro RifleGaming is awesome, you trippin
---
I've never fully completed this one. No matter where I go for Yao Gaui, the damn things have been kicked to death by Rad Stags.
---
No worries I have the ability to get the items I need for the build if you check my trade list plus I have friends
---
I'm guessing the strategy doesn't work financially as most publishers have completely stopped going down this route but I prefer proper DLC like Fallout 4 did with its season pass or better yet New Vegas. You pay for the big stuff and get everything that comes with it, then you can have the atomic shop with new weekly content to keep the game fresh. I think keeping the free atoms high would make more sense encouraging daily players while charging more casual / infrequent players. This way you'd probably keep a high player base, still get some cash from atoms sold and get cash for the dlc content. Maybe it's just me but I'd rather spend cash on the main content rather than the cosmetic stuff. (I've bought atoms twice and 1st once btw)
---
I sold three raven masks for 500 caps each. I don't know why.
---
I don't have to it has been for a long time, I don't disguise that. Imagine being the guy who replies with nothing helpful, that I have to imagine.
---
There‚Äôs always two at Dolly Sods and at Monaghan overlook.
---
I just find the reward/effort ratio to be pretty low.
---
Most of the locations in 76 have a real life counterpart in WV.
---
Yea, I was bored at work one day and cross referenced most of them via google earth.
---
For example:
---
WS is aka the Greenbriar.  Its (once secret) function included nuke proof underground command and control bunkers for the US Govt to hide in the event of a nuke emergency in DC.
---
The various named cities exist.
---
 Wade airport is real, just under a different name, but the runway and building layout is almost identical.  Its location relative to a power plant is also similar.
---
THe pumpkin house is a real thing.
---
Tyler Cty fairgrounds is actually a school, but the track and buildings are almost the same.
---
Watoga is a region instead of a city.
---
TNT domes do exist.
---
Et al.
---
I built a 1x1 room for my companion on the edge of my build space. Doing so, my companion wanders the grounds but wont go into my house. It isnt perfect but itll keep them out of your shit for the most part.
---
Might as well hit the glass cavern quest for a set of ultracite armor right?
---
I‚Äôm just wondering why people keep thinking you can only progress through NW.. so many posts about it, however if you go to the Bethesda website and read the update info, it literally tells you that you can do challenges during regular play OR NW.. the info is there!
---
Yes, because the Scrap Box is a gameplay addition and shouldn't be charged for per Bethesda's promises.
---
That‚Äôs cool but don‚Äôt you get like almost 90% at 15 hp with bloodied. I run bloodied and most my guns are more than double in dmg? I feel berserk should be on par with that. You‚Äôre practically naked! Lol
---
I did the same to a 3\* 2 shot explosive flame thrower I looted back in the day.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
It think would be cool if Nukes and Dragons added booze to their [Fine Dining](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food) function.
---
/u/alexananiev ?
---
Some , some cardboard vault boy statues and some taxidermy animals
---
Don‚Äôt forget you can spend 150 atoms to skip a level and every 10 levels your reward is 150 atoms.
---
GOT EM
---
That happened to me yesterday. Sage comes by and all my turrets start firing at me. He runs away and then circles back like a fool. Never let me talk to him tough. Very weird.
---
Hearing people from Philadelphia also gives me this feeling :)
---
Pretty sure I dropped ultracite emergency protocols doing something similar. Was really awkward cus I only noticed after arranging a trade for them.
---
Sylvie and sons logging camp has a massive amount of wood you can get.
---
Well, by selling the game as a beginning. And those greedy games always rely on a tiny amount of vulnerable whales who finance the show for the 90% players who bought a full price game and just want to have fun with it.
---
And i would also support the game with buying atoms with they provide good content and don't try to ripp me off at any occasion and cohearse me into buying. I would pay 15 bucks for atoms the same way i would pay for a good dlc.
---
Then walk through ripper ally and down to huntersville. Best part of that run now after wastelanders, you hop up the cliff and sell or scrap at Foundation.
---
Indeed.
---
I suppose you should define ‚Äúworthless‚Äù
---
&gt;I feel that she needs a massive buff
---
If SBQ will be hard to beat by contemporary bloodies, than she will be absolutely unkillable for anybody who is not an Irradiated Mutant...
---
Bird bones has a use in a PA/Heavy build - stagger (e.g from yao gui) interupts barrel spin up which lots of heavy weapons have.
---
Bird bones gives you more hang time in the air which allows you to jump and get the gun spun up.
---
Not really needed 99% of the time but can be useful if you ever get swamped by things that use multiple staggers.
---
Also if you're running class freak anyway then its +4 agility for -1 stength.
---
As an added bonus if you use strange in numbers, the hang time for bird bones is absurd.
---
Well imo it's not good to charge a membership for shit they've promised would be free for everyone but hey
---
absolutely agreed. Who can spend about 150 hours in 10 weeks? Thats an absurd 15 hours a week. 2 workdays? Most people have a job, familly, friends and hobbies....
---
Traded a bloodied faster swing speed +1 strength deathclaw gauntlet for a Tse handmade üòî
---
Just call, and I'll be there. Always.
---
I‚Äôve been playing DayZ for now and the occasional FO76 jump on.
---
Woodchuck perk. Run through the forest and grab every fallen tree you see. Also Helvetia
---
Is a mothman tamable to have at your camp?!
---
Wait.. so I have some other place to do with my extra ammo than giving it to friends.  
---
Awesome!  Sometimes theres no one around to take the ammo that's weighing me down.
---
Equip woodchucker in luck if you have it, and go to the dried river by flatwoods. I always get a couple hundred that way. The forest in general is great though. Always logs to stumble upon.
---
I haven‚Äôt even started the grind...it was fun and then the idea of another grind just hurt lol
---
I'm gonna try this. I'll grab eggs to make the omelettes, think more charisma, if not mistaken, for more caps at vendors.
---
This....This one hurts me even 
---
RIP sorry for your loss.
---
No.
---
ahahah you noobs should be thankful, no waste of ammo and i saved you from getting whacked
---
Their HQ is in FO3 iirc, or at least there is an office building where it should be.
---
I know! It really is a great addition.
---
Lower the drop rate on legendary items and make them feel a little more legendary rather than "scrip,shite,rubbish,scrip,scrip,scrip, 0o0o0o0 oh no nvm zealots scrip.....", I scrip my limit every day then dump probably 10-20 leg-ends daily maybe more in front of scrip machines outside train stations.
---
Yea but it lets you glitch camp budget atm which essential for the most elaborate designs.
---
The hard part about a new character is just the feeling of ‚Äúrinse and repeat‚Äù. Now before people say...‚Äùwhat about other builds‚Äù it‚Äôs not the build it‚Äôs the experience.
---
i mean it has the highest stats available
---
saved, cheers
---
It hasn‚Äôt been abandoned?  When was the last new map?  The year anniversary just passed, what did Bethesda say about it?  What about new modes that have been requested for almost that entire year?  How about posts addressing cheating on PC? Does Bethesda even speak of Nuclear Winter outside of the occasional promo pack?  I‚Äôd call that being thrown a bone, not the attention the mode needs.
---
Hey if you want to claim that it hasn‚Äôt been abandoned, go ahead.  Short of pulling the plug, I‚Äôm not sure how little attention could be paid to it than is now.
---
Do you know what they are approximatly?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Red Asylum outfit. On another trading sub I‚Äôve seen people get 5:1 bundles that include a legacy weapon for that outfit.
---
It‚Äôs the rarest and most sought after outfit by far.
---
You can make money whilst still respecting your consumer and sticking to the promises you gave them
---
i always make bows and xbows explosive before selling them
---
Ive done stings and things about 20 times since getting to possum. Only once got a badge.
---
That is whats great about this spreadsheet. It does the math for you! 
---
With it you can see that stockpiling 40mm is the 3rd most efficient way to get ammo points.
---
That ammo type gives you a lot of points for how little it weighs.
---
Those conversion rates seem pretty bad. It looks to me that you would be better off just saving your ammo to sell on the marketplace, then buying the ammo you want off of someone. 
---
Although, I will miss people just dumping and giving away .38 rounds. Need cheap ammo for my meme pipe rifle.
---
Are you snapping the beams to the floor or the roof? Mine are snapped to the upper floors that are acting as the roof. It could also be related to the fact that they're at the ends of the fences, or possibly even a combination of both factors. I wish I could help more, but this is just one of those times where CAMP behavior is pretty unpredictable.
---
There is a good reason for tents to be in the area.  That is so as soon as the fight is over you can dump your flux in case you end up dying. The CAMP that is described works, the only problem is people have different opinions on where to target.  
---
Most tend to leave V9 open.  Which ends up covering Delta and sending most of the radiation off of the map.  For those of us who like to collect flux after the fight leaving Delta open tends to cover V9.  Which makes CAMP placement tricky.  Then there are those who prefer to fight in the rad zone which complicates placement further.
---
You sure it wasn‚Äôt a raider pa painted

Two Yau guai are a common spawn just west of Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast. One spawns at Monongah Overlook. One or sometimes 2 spawn at Dolly Sods Wilderness. 
---
When I want to do this quest I trigger it, go collect all the veggies from The Wayward or General‚Äôs Steakhouse.
---
I equip the Butcher‚Äôs Bounty 3 perk and kill the above Yau Guai, the Deathclaws at Deathclaw Island and Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02, and the ragtag at the farm just north-east of Dent &amp; Sons Construction (this last area may need server-hopping as the ragstags may not spawn or their corpses despawn).

I dunno their a tad too strong IMHO. Shotguns need a buff but shouldn't one shot 68 super mutants from across the room.  Only at 1m, unless a full charged guass shot?
---
327 dr, 297 er, 297 rad resist, with butressed mods, about 15-20rad/s in nuke zones
---
And to get your whole stash stolen ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
No. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creature_taming
---
I bush wookie but I dont afk while doing it, nor do I team up
---
That's cool man. You can step it up a notch more by not using a stash box too but that might be too much haha.
---
I guess they dont teach you people to read where ever you're from we just got like 4 new weapons skins and news on to maps and a rebalance scheduled for either patch 20 or 21
---
Aight then nvm thanks for your responses!
---
With the settler wanderer, if you destroy her chair with a flamethrower trap, she'll eventually stand where it should be and not move. I had her in a cell for a bit, but you have to repeat the process every log in. Otherwise, she wont move from where she loaded in at the start. It's also a little difficult to line up the trap where it will actually destroy the chair. It does work though.
---
So.
---
I was nearly right. That's good enough for me.
---
1 - only if you're dumb enough to put vendors near your spawn
---
2 - ANY CAMP can get their stash stolen from if a player can reach their vendors before full load.  This is not exclusive to glitched budgets.
---
I up voted you just coz "space woman" rofl.
---
Yeah, they are pretty bad tbh. But that means the ammo market won't be hurt by this. As you said, it is still better to sell and buy in the market. 
---
But this gives a use to garbage ammo nobody will buy/trade. Like .38 .44 and all explosives. All of that ammo can finally be converted to something you might actually want! 
---
Sorry about you meme rifel, lol. It will be missed.
---
PS: Happy Cake Day!
---
&gt;ut 15-20rad/s in nuke zones
---
Ahh so thats not so great for that then :P Overall good though. Very good.
---
Yep. Only bested by .44 and .45 (but .45 you can probably sell for caps at a better rate)
---
Just wait till your trying to use an workbench or change a foundation, then the f‚Äôer won‚Äôt move at all.
---
If you‚Äôre stealth build it‚Äôs worth grinding man I‚Äôve already almost an entire set of unyielding harder to detect pieces. I can sneak up and touch a super muts bum and not be noticed a bit.
---
Dare you to go try to trade for those or spin at the mole.
---
It's not often I actually laugh out loud reading this sub but this did it. What an awesome story lol.
---
Highly doubt you‚Äôd HAVE to do them as they‚Äôre based around daily and weekly challenges and I also doubt that you‚Äôd have to do every single challenge to max out rank..probably just makes it go as fast as possible if you do every single challenge and only some of them will be nuclear winter challenges.
---
It‚Äôs was standard yellow paint you get that I am sure if. but sadly didn‚Äôt get a pic nor did realise it until it was too late and he/she vanished
---
I got 3 alts to store ammo on
---
WOOO!
---
The Septic Survivor!
---
I never really get the point of stupidly high prices - maybe, just maybe, you'll get someone come along and pay 2000 caps for that serum, but in that time I'll have sold 10 at 299 each.
---
Oh yeah, how is the Gauss shotgun as a full health (i.e. non bloodied) build? Im maining heavy weapons now, but will switch to Gauss shotty if its one-two shotting reliably.
---
I‚Äôll just stripped tighty brownies and hide in a bush

Happy birthday to everyone who has a birthday today!!!!!

Thank you ü§©
---
Hello from Bethel!
---
Are you on. Xbox
---
Why not just scrap some of the stuff?
---
The build limit is in place because servers would crash if we all just kept building. That will more than likely never happen. They are working on instanced interior camps. So we may get an expanded area in a different way.
---
The budget exists for stability reasons. Even if you could increase it arbitrarily like that, you'd open yourself up to the stash steal exploit.
---
ps4
---
I looked at the docs, blogs, write ups and couldn‚Äôt find it.
---
The queen doesn't need a buff. The overpowered absurd builds need a nerf.
---
Yes, better trading is probably top 3 requesting things. This thread will likely get removed for rule 10 as well. We all want it, Beth just doesn't seem to care.
---
I can kind of do that already for free :P
---
still need stealth suit for nuke zones but u can survive in it
---
I listened to him before I found Lou and I was disappointed by his Pittsburgh accent. I think that's why I liked discovering Lou so much, hearing him talk with a legit thick yinzer accent
---
That IS my argument. 
---
Theyre removing the ability to grind daily to get atoms. 
---
Seasons should have been a completely independent thing. With its own challenges on top of what exists now. 
---
Theyre literally taking away 5000 atoms, and giving us maybe 5 or 10 camp items and costumes and calling it something new. Its not.
---
If you have a LOT of junk then it can lag.
---
Problem is the csa is so good and free I cant get away from it:P
---
I have an RP comic book store and on EVERY server login I run into my shop and turn the two radios on as it totally helps the atmosphere in there, it's become a habit now and if I come back and find I forgot to turn them on I kinda hope it didn't disappoint a player's visit.......and I don't shoot level one critters, Annnnnd every time I do a lead run to the six gyms I know of on the map, when I get to Flatwoods gym I run through the reception pick up the phone and pencils and on the way out you encounter Horace the possum (yeeah I named him...) and I'm like "Hi Horace, excuse me please So I can come through the door" as he squeaks and snorts off.
---
I can get behind what you're saying. But one thing you are missing is how expensive atoms actually are. I dont know about you but I am not willing to pay 10 USD for 1 power armor skin.
---
I‚Äôve got that on PS4. But I‚Äôve got a lot in my scrap box. More than I will ever need for most materials. 
---
I‚Äôm now thinking of bulking/selling to reduce the amounts of some stuff.
---
What platform?
---
Thats not becketts line. thats the raider punk
---
This too. What an absolute joke. They reworked some to make them a little easier and then said nah lets monetize this instead.
---
Hmmm, well that stinks lol guess I'll have to take stock of all my junk now! Thx
---
but dont forget that there is also radshield and rad-x so its a bit less then what i wrote, but i could not live with the csa, i need the legendary perks, and the csa is only for nuke zones for me.
---
VATS is funky with it, but as far as manually aiming it's good. You'll need to get in much closer range than you're probably used to though.

---
WickedyChickady: good guides and how to get things done in the game
---
Captain noob: if you want to learn about builds
---
Scrap your turrets and base defense, they eat into your budget big time. Of course build all the crafting tables so traveling Wastelanders can use your equipment.
---
Was waiting for someone to say this, but I was going to say "Buying the game for $60" if nobody else did. I knew I had to look at the very bottom to see if anybody said it before me though, since it'd inevitably be hidden by votes.
---
Bulked too much aluminum, took me 15 whole minutes of farming to correct
---
I also enjoy building bases for low level players as long as I have materials. My base is a restaurant I like to call simple Rick's. And when he said I had a lot of purification power I have 23 industrial purifiers
---
In all seriousness - I don‚Äôt need 6000 wood. 
---
I‚Äôve been just scrapping the wasteland. For the past two months. 
---
I might put bulked items like steel, lead, screws, etc. in my vendors, too.
---
I don‚Äôt need your hand outs hot dog man
---
I had that issue too. I noticed that storing to many notes and halotaps also makes the stash box lag
---
True which is why i space new characters out months apart. I take lengthy breaks and play other games.
---
Do people really buy that? Not being sarcastic, I don't have a vendor setup yet. Sounds like I might need to!
---
It sounds like that may be what they are thinking for future seasons but the 1st one is more bare bones
---
I do have a shitload of holotapes and notes... Time to clear out the junk from the junk!
---
Exactly, I completely agree with you.
---
FINALLY a use for .44
---
Nuka Quantum paint looks great imo.
---
She wasn‚Äôt nearly that invincible in the beginning, just a difficult and long fight. It used to take preparation beyond having certain legendary gear equipped. Now we see 1-3 guys with the correct gear pretty much soloing her while bitching about everyone else taking shots at her in the air. I‚Äôm seeing instances where regular players start SE but have no idea what to do because there‚Äôs no net build around to kill off the Queen. These guides, tips and rants about what the power gamers expect from everyone else are helping no one. They extol the benefits of being graced by a net build coming to kill the queen, in exchange for her loot of course. There‚Äôs no sense of accomplishment with SE anymore. Where once you had a rush from taking her down with only a few minutes left, now you have people pitching a fit that she‚Äôs still alive after 5 minutes. Buff her or remove the items necessary for the op net builds. Make it so she only pops up if the nuke is dropped directly on the fissure. It‚Äôs getting to the point where regular players don‚Äôt have interest in SE because they don‚Äôt get anything for trying to take part. It‚Äôs become a way for power players to get legendaries and a few plans to sell at their CAMP, and nothing more.
---
I can't seem to place my tent down here. Just get a message that says Overlaps existing build area. In a private session by myself lol
---
When I sold off a TSE Guass and Tesla rifle very cheaply not knowing that they were legacy weapons and valuables
---
NW gang rise up
---
This is really cool.  I sometimes go to the overlook where the Order of Mysteries quest ended and just chill.  My buddy has a nice camp called the Bomb's Away Bar, for some reason we have seen a ton of rp in there even from guys I would never expect it from.  We have 5 bases we cluster with Free States and Blue Ridge motif to draw people in.
---
As atoms will be harder to obtain, the atom shop should be separate as most atoms will come from fallout 1st subscription or real life üí∞
---
The season should be more immersive &amp; also related to the current content.
---
Currently wastelanders - so why not have settler, secret service &amp; raider rewards &amp; then bos rewards when that content drops.  There is only 2 items I want in the first season, but will wait to see what the grind is before I'll decide to grind or not.
---
Nice.
---
Behind the donut maker house in Helvetia there is a a firewood pile that you can loot like 20+ times. That whole area is also surrounded by logs.
---
Some workshops have wood resources. You can claim one and let it sit for a bit of wood every once and a while.
---
Every item in your Camp adds to the data load between you, the server, and any player within rendering distance. If you assume its set up to handle 20+ players all moving and performing actions on top of the unique position of camp items then the data transfers can ramp up quickly and lag soon occurs...and with lag comes opportunity for exploits as well as generally making the game pretty unplayable.
---
I read the title of this post as 'seducing the queen'.....
---
I'll let myself out now...
---
Aye. it does that sometimes. It's whack. 
---
Saw someone before who literally put the tent in the gap in the wall. 
---
Also it didn't work for me before. Tent in same place. enemies spawned all over. Then it did work.
---
I have the same thing happen. But there are a lot of turds who attack new players so I guess I can see their being cautious. I was trying to give someone a whole set of armor and they ran away from me.
---
Ok. I'll be that guy. Giggity....
---
The green military paint that can be purchased from modus
---
If it‚Äôs priced correctly someone will buy it. I try not to price too high for stuff. And what I sell usually goes in a few days. 
---
If I can sell diluted stimpacks for 4 caps to a vendor bot, I‚Äôll price them at 6-10 caps in my vendors - usually on the lower side. 
---
My biggest sellers: magazines and bobbleheads. I intentionally go around and farm these. Put them all in my vendors. Within a few days I‚Äôll have players buying them all.
---
All you can do is put stuff in your vendors and see what sells. If people aren‚Äôt buying it‚Äôs your prices or what you are offering. If it‚Äôs not selling then go to a vendor bot, drop it to another player, or drop it in a lake.
---
Helvetia has a load in an out house behind the yellow building and pricketts fort has a ton also
---
The vendor is classed as a stash box as well but you can sell from that's probably why
---
It is, without a doubt, the best armor available. It has the highest damage, energy and radiation resistance of all. And it is guaranteed to be legendary. 
---
The butressed mod is the way to go and you have a slot for a secondary mod. 
---
There is a vid on youtube by Jerseys Ghost called Which is the best armor &amp; power armor
---
I have mods so i can't play nw
---
This is allways my 1st option. Got so much wood early on the game I haven't gone for more since lvl 40 (Im a 145)
---
Alright, thanks for the advice :)
---
I picked up this one hobo astronaut hoping to help her out (and also get laid in the process). But now she just won't stop complaining about her headaches!
---
Next Tuesday atom shop update: 1 turd skin for the fixer!
---
I'll just have to keep at it I suppose.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
I actually stayed a bit longer there, and 2 scorched attacked the camp when i spawned in with my second acc he killed them doing the same routine again lol
---
I love playing around with the different movement speeds thanks to the controller analog stick sensitivity (I'm on pc using zone controller) when taking my time exploring etc. So basically continuously transitioning from full speed jog into mid-speed or walking, according to what's near me. 
---
For instance when approaching a player at full jog I slowly reduce my speed until I stop, rather than the robotic instant stop when running or even sprinting. Makes the game's pacing slower and it feels more immersive.
---
Nuka Quantum paint. I just pulled the trigger from a vendor and it looks super sick. I'd love to try the mission run soon to get extra plans that don't cost as much as mine did :/ Also as an aside, the regular Nuka paint for the t51 paint is also super dope.
---
The lack of skins for basic armor and weapons is really disappointing. Everyday there‚Äôs at least one post asking for more basic skins. I would buy some for a few different legendary weapon types If they were in store this minute. I mean we are asking to give them our money and they don‚Äôt listen.
---
Glad you got a laugh out of it man. I was just standing there, puzzled at first. Then i busted out laughin too hehe
---
they where going to release a clean toilet but they had to flush the idea
---
Is there a tutorial for this somewhere?
---
Just make sure that you go in solo if you do this, don‚Äôt ruin the game for those who enjoy Nuclear Winter
---
Just abolish capitalism! Problem solved.
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with your point, but have you already crafted the new weapons to get the rolls you want?  I had pretty good luck with secret service unyielding, and completed a full decent set, but I was trying for *vanguard*.  That took 50 modules.  I‚Äôve spent another 50 modules on the new guns and I‚Äôve had 2 that were worth keeping. 
---
It‚Äôs completely in the realm of possibilities that it would take 100-300 modules to end up with something like a bloodied 25/25 handmade.
---
Edit to add: that‚Äôs 1000-3000 scrip if someone keeps at that one item they‚Äôre trying to get the roll they want.
---
... Except, the game was *not* "fully develeped" *or* a modern AAA game. They charged full price for Fallout 4 multiplayer, with massive launch-day issues. The graphics are *slightly* better than those of FO4, but that isn't saying much because FO4's graphics were outdated even five years ago.
---
And, yes, people simply playing the game *does* make Bethesda money. The thing is, nobody is going to pay money for stuff in an empty game. There has to be a balance between "development for player enjoyment" and "development to make $" otherwise the system falls apart.
---
"Bugfixes forever without error, fault, or delay" Really? Nobody expects that. That's another balancing act; you can have two of those things, but not all three. For example, smaller games can update daily/weekly, and sometimes the patch fixes the bug, sometimes it doesn't, but at least you know work is actually happening. The opposite end of the spectrum is taking your time, *using* the PTS, and ensuring the bugfix both fixes the problem and ensures no further issues arise. You'd think, with FO76's glacial update pace, they'd spring for that, but instead issues from as far back as FO3 persist a decade later.
---
90% of the rewards from this Season are better than most of the shit I‚Äôve seen in the atom shop, so I‚Äôm not too mad about it.
---
I forget does the battle pass work across all characters or just one?

They all basically need razorgrain and boiled water. Just stock up on them and then the small ingredients like blight, fungus, ashrose, etc.

Yes, I don‚Äôt get the resistance to that at all. The second a game stops being fun, you stop playing and find another game.

I really like the CAMP building aspect. When I was low level, I was hanging out at camp rebuilding somethings for my two story house. A nice high level named Mephilist came along and starting emoting me with the thumbs up emote. I was still pretty new so it took me a few minutes to figure out how to emote back. He then invited me to the group and built me a fancy bed and candle sconces! It was really awesome because he seemed like he was able to tell the type of style I was going for with my house building (a house full of antiques and dark wooden furniture. He also dropped a bunch of purified water and aid items and left. That was really awesome of him to do that.
---
Thanks man. Been here often and sometimes found stories like that too. But nothing ever happened to me so much. You bet i gonna get a recording app now. Wards escapades alone would be worth it.
---
You aren't wrong, but it's worth pointing out that PoE is free. A better example might be the latest CoD games, BO4 or MW, which are both full-price and feature exorbitant cosmetic prices.
---
Yeah i figured, i've never stored perishables in my stash or vendor so didn't think before wasting muh atoms xD
---
On a related note, don't suppose you know how food perishes while in stash/vendor? If i start fast travelling around the map will it spoil faster? Or is it a set timer?
---
Pornhub
---
Indeed!!
---
Thats true, but that place is boring compared to the bridge
---
If you leave your character afk for too long you will begin to starve. This will make you loose health but not completely die. If an enemy atacks you then you are going to die. 
---
Upon death you drop all of your junk. So weapons and armor wont be lost. Junk is just crafting materials. So they arent as important. Besides you can respawn and pick them back up. 
---
Few battles take too long but some quests will take a good chunk of time. 
---
In the end I recomend the game specially RN since it is 50% off on STEAM. That is if youre on PC.
---
I think it has a set timer for when it spoils, I don't think fast traveling will affect it in any way
---
IIRC you can run legendary armor with Berserker, just break it first. You still get the bonuses, but not the armor.
---
Two things. Did a bag swap between alts of a bunch of quality legendaries from main to alt and the server crashed. And once dropped a quad explosive +1 str double barrel shotty without realizing and it was lost to the elements. I still dream of getting my quad back... Absolutely loved that weapon
---
This has never been an issue for me. I have a small house with my companion and a garage in a sepate building. The companion will NEVER go into the garage, they stay at the house. Since my garage is where all my workbenches are, Im happy.
---
While in the fridge it spoils 50% slower than out of it. I think the fridge works about the same as running Good with Salt perks
---
No one ever mentions Pricketts Fort for wood, but there in addition to Helvetia and the Sylvie &amp; Son's Logging Camp, all three of those places have a lot of wood piles.
---
I really like JerseysGhost. He sometimes does livestreams and posts videos about rare clothing. For now he just streams GTA V role playing, at least until FO76 has more content.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to suggest Pricketts Fort for wood..
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è working fine for me
---
I agree with most of this, but I‚Äôve tried using a short barrel on the different shotguns, and the damage starts to drop at five feet from the enemy. That‚Äôs too little range, even for a shotgun.
---
My camp! I sell them supper cheap. Are you on PC?
---
Lmao unintentional I swear ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Really?  And you're on Xbox?
---
Yep
---
Honestly? Even after I maxed the rep, I still donate because the quest still gives caps and scrip, and I‚Äôm not being burdened with worthless scrap that my stash box can‚Äôt handle.
---
I found that the fridge works same as Good With Salt rank 2 which is 50%. With rank 3 at 90% it's much better to keep all food with you in Inventory. That goes for raw flux too.
---
I also bought the fridge thinking I could off-load raw flux whilst I went to find high rad fluids etc, but it doesn't work like that. 
---
I put in a support ticket to Bethesda and told them what I thought of their fridge. They refunded the atoms, and let me keep the fridge anyway. I have never used it since.
---
I really love this idea. It makes me wish they would bring survival mode back, but with more of a PVE focus, or just the ability to run it on a private server. PVP is just too unbalanced for me to personally enjoy it much
---
server maintenance here too
---
You saved yourself the headache of a .308 ammo economy hell though
