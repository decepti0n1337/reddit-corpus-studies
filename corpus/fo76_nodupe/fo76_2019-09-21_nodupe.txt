I've been able to do it in under 8 min with my heavy gunner.  Just sprinting to each goal.  So it is doable, but I don't know what hints or tips to give out since it seems like you're doing exactly what I did.
---
I like to think overall except for a tiny minority of douchebags we are that awesome. As a 650 with 3100+ hours in I always keep an eye out for new players exiting the vault and drop supplies and plans. Someone did it for me when I first joined almost two years ago. I was a fresh level 2 exiting and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. The game had been out a month or so and I heard horror stories about high levels ganking low levels at the vault and train stations. 
---

---
As soon as I come out there were three over level 100s there and I was like ‚Äú shit ‚Äú. But to my surprise they all three dropped me water and food and ammo and a level 5 gun and armor and plans. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing with those 3 guys since that day ( and have even passed them up in level ) but I always remember the lesson they taught me that first day and pay it forward. 
---
This community as a whole has a reputation for doing that and I hope it never changes.
---
I‚Äôve been doing Morgantown HS, but like I said, the Scorched there are eating loads of ammo. Haven‚Äôt found the Cat Lady house yet. I‚Äôll snoop around for it. Neither of those perk cards have shown up yet. Looking forward to them. Thanks.
---
To be completely honest here: I hope the current Brotherhood Power Armor paint schemes become either legacy all together or removed - i realize they're just Fallout 4 assets but with the new T-60 we see in the promo art for Steel Dawn its lacking a rank insignia which means the time traveling rank schemes won't be a thing. 
---
Having 2 different Power Armor paint schemes for the Brotherhood would just be extremely weird honestly plus (Slight spoilers!) we'll be able to instead turn Technical Data to 'Fort Atlas' (ATLAS Observatory) when the Brotherhood arrives. So the 'Forbidden Knowledge' quest will instead either become just a Misc quest or will have it's map marker moved. I personally hope for the former, having it being a Misc quest means we'll be able to turn in Tech Data without worrying about how many we're carrying.
---
Plus Season 3 is Brotherhood themed so you'll get your wish, i too want Brotherhood Power Armor paint schemes for the other Power Armor sets as well.
---
Nah. Just basic one star. I‚Äôll probably trade it for a small amount of ammo.
---
There is, but you can‚Äôt mix it with regular scout armor variants for the set bonus.  I guess it makes sense but wow.  I think building an unyielding Thorn set is the grind that makes the other grinds look like child‚Äôs play.
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôve been there myself.
---
I soloed it today.  I didn't use commando though.
---
It also only matters the weapon you actually kill them with no matter what you do most of the damage with, which means if you switch to melee for that last hit you get a random bullet type. I think if someone else kills an enemy you tag it goes based on the weapon you have equipped when they die, though this could use some testing to be sure.
---
It doesn‚Äôt fix it for me but it eventually hoes away. I just hate completing a challange at the start of ever session just to rank up 15 times.
---
Weird, probably just glitches out in thinking. I know if you use melee, the enemies drop random ammo types and as a melee player, I‚Äôve seen next to no shotgun shells drop for me.
---
The handmade rifles are the hacked weapons you tend to see the most. These ones are quite easy to spot generally as they have the beam splitter attachment on the end of the barrel.
---
Ps4. 
---
I‚Äôm willing to trade them for ammo. I wouldn‚Äôt really charge more than 500 for a 1 star. Unless you prefer that.
---
PS4, but thank you. Everyone here seems really helpful, and it‚Äôs great. I was apprehensive to even start playing because I know a lot of online games have shit communities.
---
You could probably get something for it in your vendor. There are likely a number of people switching to junkies from bloodied to be more tanky and it's a good weapon until you get a better one.
---
Yes, please do share!
---
That sucked to lose that easy farm spot.... I mean.. uhh .. it sucked to lose the ease of access to my tent so I can dump all the junk without having to walk so far when the event is over.
---
Not new. Been using computers since I was 3 years old.
---
Been around since IDE, and SD Ram was a thing. 
---
I'm just asking if anyone else has noticed an increase in activity.
---
Sounds great, mate. I'll keep an eye out.
---
Mhm. Thank you for that. I‚Äôll try.
---
I‚Äôd put that on my shelf for sure!! Well done!
---
I like that.
---
For the raiders, maybe raid a blood eagles location, or a far out settlement somewhere. Take all the resources, and have to burn or otherwise destroy structures.
---
For the settlers, we could be scavenging in grocery stores infested with ghouls for canned goodsand other utility items.
---
I‚Äôve put a lot into Strength so far. I‚Äôm also perking into rifles via Perception. I‚Äôve never been much interested in melee, but with all the suggestions here, it seems like I should reconsider. Thanks!
---
I used to be a vault dweller, til I took a laser to the knee
---
 Now that you brought this up..... they‚Äôll probably give us less üòÇüëçüòÇ
---
When there are four people boosting the uplink don‚Äôt leave to go Rambo. The uplink is slow enough.
---
If you've done Wastelanders quest you can buy dynamite with gold bullion. Its cheaper to craft then frags and they are more powerful!!
---
Can buy them from the bot in Crater.
---
Sadly I am on pc :(
---
I pushed through most of it solo as well, I was around level 123 when my friends started playing with me. It is rough being a solo player, but now that I have them I think starting over shouldn‚Äôt be too rough. 
---
I also found my first perfect roll weapon a few weeks ago‚Äî A Two Shot Explosive Gatling Gun. Which was perfect for me because i run heavy gunner/melee. That plus the sick skin that came out for the gatling gun in season 1 and i thought i was in heaven. Alas, it was all for nought
---
No! Don't go with him AT ALL! Let them run, alone, to your camp. Its SAFER that way...you going along only makes things notice it!
---
I wonder why we cannot grow some irradiated cannabis.
---
Same, lvl19 as of today.
---
I only use about 1/2 the XP buffs that Kato mentions though (too lazy to keep maintaining that). Being that I finished the last season with weeks to go, there's really no rush...   but those glass walls!!!
---
Nuke their camps lol
---
Darn lol. I hate it when that happens lol. Cross platform would be nice to have one day.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôd really appreciate that
---
It's the "Missile Silo State Holotape"
---
I think you get a free one during the enclave quest line at some point, otherwise you can buy a replacement in the bunker armory.
---
I've been seeing those, Railway rifles with Minigun barrels hanging out the end, I actually saw a genuine Laser Musket from Fallout 4 lmfao
---
Yeah it would be nice!
---
Because once you get all the rewards from Earl,the event isn't really worth it anymore. It's faster and easier to get a chance of a decent legendary from ops.
---
Don't blame ops, blame there being no incentive to do other stuff.
---
Oh thank you!
---
Ok hmu on x1 gt veto bill
---
User name checks out
---
There is a great plastic haul from the life preservers and other containers in the raider mirelurk camp place
---
Someone or something likely killed the mobs for you! 
---
Win win!!
---
I know! This community has been great so far! 
---
I have been timid to jump into Daily Ops, because I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on other players, but I did join a public team yesterday, and had a great time. I only died three times, and the other two folks on my team were quick to help out. I did my best to keep up and not be too much of a burden. We definitely didn‚Äôt hit Elder, and that was definitely my fault for not doing enough damage, but I was pretty stoked we did hit Paladin.
---
For sure
---
Vats will always be broken. Its main feature was that it can pause time and allow the player to make targetted precision attacks. Now its in real time, and smoke can even interfere with targetting.
---
Melee for Mongrels!
---
Bethesda's never doing the free atoms post season. There's a reason why we can't ever get atoms from challenges now. All the atoms you get during a season is what Bethesda is comfortable giving away for free. 
---
That's it. Bethesda would rather you stop playing the game altogether after you're done with the season than give you free atoms to keep playing.
---
Is this supposed to be like those energy axes in newvegas?
---
Farm super mutants.
---
If you're on Xbox, I'm more than glad to carry you. 
---
All you need to do is stay by the uplink.
---
Textures are the least of the worries with this game.
---
You can do it solo. I just wear the appropriate enemy armor effect and stand by the beacon. If they get near,  I melee,  otherwise I can tank the enemies. Also, the boss can't use their ranged attack if you are in their grill
---
I used my bloody commando. It took me 4 tries to get elder solo today. The first try i got paladin, then finished at 8:45 and 8:01. Lol. I finally got it on the 4th try in 7:15, and got the vault 94 stash box plans. 
---
Sounds like youre very close. I just sprinted to each objective. The distance between objectives is further than the mines or valley galleria, so you do need to find the right paths. But I found if I just ran toward the marker it was fast enough. I started with the objective with the wooden walkway above it and just stayed on the walkway and vatsed the enemies. The part that always slowed me down was the end before the boss where the super mutants would spawn under, over and spread out in that final room. 
---
Just make sure you dont loot any enemies until after the op is over. Unless you can loot them without leaving the radio radius.
---
There are set explosive crates around Appalachia that always drops either a grenade or mine.
---
Just need to look around for them.
---
IN DECEMBER :O
---
Had the same thing, also found a 3* legendary SB too
---
I just got to 420 myself and got the game in April.
---
Sounds like a bug. Were you using a shotgun by chance?
---
Edit: i see you were. A lot of people have been posting about this
---
Just don‚Äôt mind the occasional scorch beast crashing through your window.
---
And sometimes there might be a deathclaw knocking at your front door that‚Äôs strayed from a cave nearby.
---
Oh, I‚Äôm using a combat rifle and a handmade as well. They do about a third the damage that the shotguns do though. Emptying a clip into a Rad Rat seems ridiculous to me, but I guess this is my life now.
---
True that man, my buddy doesnt understand why i nuke whitesprings.  Its for the flora not the xp.
---
That thing pissed me off so much the 2nd time I used it, I deleted and scrapped it. Fuck that thing.
---
Good idea. Server hopping campsites might be more productive. Thanks for the advice!
---
They have some problems like trying to invalidate how play styles and the wonky nature of being kicked after x amount of time after you finish as well as being booted out if you bring up the results.
---
That brought back many bad memories.
---
I think the worse thing they did was make boullion. Well the worst part was making the ability to create legendary items but not able to trade them.
---
This is sadly not accurate. You can get all the way to the end without having a card. The game will warn you through the intercom that ‚Äòno keycard is detected‚Äô but if you‚Äôre ignoring it or have the sound down, sucks to be you.
---
I know, the grind is so tedious, I would love if they add 50 perk points every 25-50 levels.
---
I'm level 140, have played more than 250 hours and only have 2 perks in level 2. üôÉ
---
I didn't transfer an account from the Bethesda Launcher, I started playing directly on Steam, so the 800+ hours are all from there :(
---
Thats the way  I did it. You naturally level up and get all that you need as you go along and progress the story. It takes you to mostly safe areas for the levels that you're at to keep the story moving.
---
I still do certain one's but once you have done them a billion times it becomes stale and tedious.same old same old.
---
I wish there were more creeps critters and monsters roaming everywhere.i love to just wander and fight them.
---
397.
---
But I have the carry weight card, and a max health power armor build with electric absorption and healing factor... and a vampire/FFR/90 ultracite gatling.
---
Aaaaaand.... I dropped Symptomatic.
---
I'm basically invincible in PVE =3.
---
:( So much for that sweet, sweet, gauss minigun
---
Exactly.
---
That quest is all bugged. Besides what was already mentioned, if it activates for me it tells me to talk to the robot. If I hop a server with it still active, it skips the robot part and tells me to the location of the squatters.
---
Shit. I have like 1000 Stims on a mule that I'm never going to need and no one wants haha.
---
I didn't even know this was a thing until last week. I saw the plan for 15K caps and bought it immediately... and have no intentions of using it anytime soon LOL. Just super rare.
---
I remember server hopping forever to find graham just to get the disco ball plan, and that was way before there was a meet week, so you had to find him on the random encounters.
---
There's no way it's that little xp.  I just gained 10k xp and moved maybe 20% of a level.
---
Boo!
---
itd be great if it was 50PP every 50 levels. Itd be so much better
---
&gt; When you add a new reward to a game that is boring and does not add new events, factions or areas, that is the definition of a grind.
---
Some of us enjoy the journey that is the grind required to build a powerful character. I have countless hours in another online game that has grinding as it's end game focus. Where some people do it with just one character because that's all they can stomach I have three doing the grind and I'm still enjoying it years after everyone else has finished.
---
Of course at the end of the day you're not required to go through this grind to have a good character. My characters in the other game were all very powerful before I started the grind. I only started it because I wanted to start it. Likewise I have had high level characters in this game that were solid before the legendary perks came out.
---
That said I'm way past the point I the time to invest into it for every new character I create so I'd be perfectly fine with the unlocks and rank-ups being account wide rather than on a per-character basis.
---
Looking forward to Bandolier! Although carry weight isn‚Äôt my issue rn... I‚Äôve gotten accustomed to being overburdened in the Appalachian Wasteland. An Ammo Converter would be awesome. I‚Äôve got tons of ammo I haven‚Äôt found a use for yet. Haven‚Äôt discovered the munitions factory yet. I guess I‚Äôm on the hunt for a decent melee weapon now.
---
I finally got that the other day, I was super stoked!
---
I stacked a bunch of them next to my chicken coup and water pump for the LOLs
---
O well thats odd then , I got the achievement on steam after it did my 64 . I'd say ask support but I doubt they'll help you very busy people apparently.
---
Is there a location that he normally at or is it completely random
---
This has been my experience. I run melee and my elite team of friends that carry me do most of the killing. If I have my 50 cal out I get 50 cal ammo from enemies that I didn‚Äôt even hit. If I have my power fist out I‚Äôll get random ammo.
---
I‚Äôve tagged enemies with 50 cal and swapped to power fist and got random ammo. So it‚Äôs been my experience through a lot of swapping that you get ammo based off the equipped weapon on enemy death.
---
Misguided forces is too easy.you start it.then go straight to the bridge spaeker.kill the 2 ghouls and crouch.all the enemies get stuck on the far gazebo.as long as you stay crouched and hidden you can easily pass the mission....and hope none else shows up and moves around.then all hell breaks loose.lol
---
It‚Äôs a timing thing. I have both and I just jump earlier to get into those places.
---
For context when were you on last? I need to know of it was before or after the update, whether it's a change to the increase in difficulty from the update or something that happened between Tuesday and now.
---
Perk cards are worth the grind even to scrap them.
---
üòâ
---
Well yeah, we try to help.
---
When your son sees a a high level player remind him that they went through the same difficulties as him to get there.
---
It gets rough between levels 20 and 50 so good luck helping him through those.
---
Honestly just use power armor, it's a lot better.  If you need fusion cores, google a list of power armor spawn locations and whenever you see a set of power armor, take the fusion core off of it.  Yes they'll be at 25%, but you can get a ton of them.  The perk batteries included can reduce their weight by 90%.  It's in intelligence
---
I went to the Whitespring earlier today. Blew loads of bullets on the ghouls, then ran into the Grafton Monster... game over. Is there a part of that place I could run through for some plastic without getting murdered?
---
AAE 10mm SMG. AAE is the new meta and overall they outperform handmades. And in Daily Ops the lack of a silencer no longer is a problem.!
---
Remember when we all were greeted by Grrrrrrafton's mayor whenever we logged in? Good times.
---
[Here's my current build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9f235d9&amp;d=xa1x90x50x82x40sa2sb2sf2s61pd2pk2pl2pp2p02ej1c11cu0ce0ic4a72s72an2am2ar0a00lv2lr0lu2l71lb2&amp;m=051c29fe8gh36&amp;am=162937-162532-122436-12213a-122431&amp;wp=w5w5&amp;wm=1k2532-1i2835)
---
Armor is only as good as its legendary perks. Vanguards for high health and bolstering for low health. Non legendary armor is just not worth the investment IMO. You outgrow if far too quickly once you are above level 50. Different armors do have different resistances so you can try to put together a set depending on what you need it for, but investing in non legendary armor is mostly a waste.
---
Whenever I am leveling a new toon I just use whatever armor I can find until I am high enough level to start using legendary pieces I find while leveling or buy off of other players.
---
Tell that to the guy who was on my ass with a flamer during Earle with the two of us going full TF2 Heavy/Medic stack
---
I would instantly take it lol. I frickin hate getting stagger locked, especially when they're not even doing that much damage. Even with the pneumatic chest mod it's still pretty annoying.
---
Yeah you have to go out all the way down the links to find the stuff and inside.check everywhere.the time sucks though.i feel they should have given another 2 mins .
---
Rad-X and Radaways are so redundant due to people maining Bloodied, Decon Showers and What Rads? Might as well just sell them for caps.
---
Wow, Bethesda actually fixed something this patch!
---
Out of curiosity, whats your INT? And what level are you?
---
Your right. Forgot about not getting anything üòÖ
---
Lvl 267.  Int is 26 to 29.
---
That is pretty cool! These would be great for a stop motion movie.
---
I have to sit down and figure out my cards tbh its been a whole lot of guessing until now
---
Yeh, I‚Äôm blowing through levels. I just feel like I‚Äôm not keeping up when it comes to guns and ammo. And everything breaks constantly.
---
I am not using gun fu, and I only have one star in adrenaline currently. [Here's my build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9f235d9&amp;d=xa1x90x50x82x40sa2sb2sf2s61pd2pk2pl2pp2p02ej1c11cu0ce0ic4a72s72an2am2ar0a00lv2lr0lu2l71lb2&amp;m=051c29fe8gh36&amp;am=162937-162532-122436-12213a-122431&amp;wp=w5w5&amp;wm=1k2532-1i2835)
---
I'll take the shine. Gonna have a hit in my cabin and see where the game sends me!
---
Im really confused honestly. With 36-40 INT it does only take me around 15k xp at level 220~.
---
I'm pretty sure the last quest should be to launch a nuke so if your not on that you shouldn't be finished with quest line yet. Don't quote me on this tho
---
sent a req, I'm Kiri
---
Heavy combat armour, can buy the plans from vendors  in swamp and bog but it won't be cheap or you could ask a player to make you a set. (Added bonus you can buy the BOS mod from the train vendor in Grafton which gives the highest damage resist)
---
Only downside is it is expensive to repair but you also have the white knight perk unlock to reduce the frequency of armour repair and repair cost.
---
Every chassis I‚Äôve come across has had armor that was leveled above me. I‚Äôm on the lookout though. Edit to add: I never really enjoyed PA in FO4, but I‚Äôm game to try again if I can find some that I can use... and then also find enough Fusion Cores.
---
I'd be on the NV-style scrap train ten days a week.
---
I like them, except for the ones in the Burrows. I've never really had trouble getting Eldar rank, but I hate how difficult it is to navigate. It's just too damned dark in this map.
---
Question, can you tame many pets and select which to display? Or is it a one time thing, where your previous pet disappear when you tame a new one?
---
I ahhh I was pulling a late night gaming session Friday night and a fell asleep controller in hand standing at a player vendor. When I saw the headline I hoped it wasn‚Äôt a story about some loser standing at a vendor for an hour. Sorry if I inconvenienced anyone.
---
+1 agility, double damage if target has full hp, and explosive bullets. Btw can you explain what a magic weapon is please.
---
[deleted]
---
Wow, that's cool.
---
I've been wondering what this was since I started last month, drives me nuts. Thanks for the info!
---
Its a weapon that does glitched damage, does any of your armor have 15% reduced damage while blocking?
---
Mini nukes i use all the time i have a TS fatman with mirv and a bloodied ff fr i which are great for crowd control
---
It randomly pops up. It's hit or miss
---
But they still increase your damage. You have to make a choice between whether you want to spend perk cards on increasing your damage as much as possible, or continuing to struggle because you stack QoL perks. When you're fighting multiple enemies, an extra 10-20 damage could be the difference between being able to take out all the enemies in a single clip vs needing to reload midfight. It could be the difference between you finishing off a deathclaw before it finishes ripping your head off. Its the same with damage negating perks, you spend some points to grab dodgy or serendipity, or Ironclad or Barbarian or something like that and that extra damage resistance or reduction could just outright save your life in a fight where you'd die if you didn't have it. But atleast you can die knowing that you were able to carry 1000 stimpacks.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put toooo much effort into armour at the moment, your levels will start to fly by and you‚Äôll get it 50 before you know it. Join in lots of events and take a couple of shots at each enemy to max your XP gain while letting the PA-clad lvl 500s take all the damage
---
Personally id lose some of those str perks and good with salt and get gun fu and more crit perks in luck
---
Yeah I agree. It seems like they need to do some balancing on the ! Public events that don‚Äôt have very good loot
---
got lucky and finally got a reward tonight ( liquid courage )
---
2 outta 6 daily op/days  .... thats some horrid rng
---
I think treasury notes and gold should be able to be turned into perk coins
---
Aussies get thrown onto the Asian region servers. In Asian videogame culture they are big on p2w so you see lots of people who bought the stuff illegitimately on websites...
---
I see it a lot too, it used to annoy me but honestly you get desensitized to it after a while lol... Who cares, just enjoy your gameplay let them do whatever.
---
Smiley should also sell card packs
---
For resilient one i found a good weapon weapon for it, shredded minigun ! Fire and "bash dmg" in the same times, the hard part is to have enough reach for it, obviously this not work with an explosive minigun (or if you want to die lol).
---
Man I wish I was on pc because us orphans need to stick together!
---
As long as we don't go to the "good old days" of 24+ Alterac Valley battlegrounds for a daily ops mission taking that long.
---
Aim for the combat inhibitor on robots. Gives you the most damage and can make them fight other robots.
---
This happened to me earlier, there's so many new players and people leveling ALTs that the cache gets cleaned out by other players it seems. That's probably an unintentional bug.
---
In order to fix this just have your buddy collect over 250 pieces of loot to reset the box contents and then try again (on a different server)
---
It's a scary world out there.
---
Hope they never fix that. Win win.
---
Gold bars for lunch boxes. Easy fix.
---
Yep, particularly when it's heavy on onscreen activity.  Multiple explosions, automatic fire, etc.
---
Most of time when I use it, I'm using power armor. I don't think any power armor mods affect blocking.
---
lol hit me up. i'm on PS4 as well. i've been on since beta. i can hook you up. üëåüèΩ
---
I would consider it a stopgap until you get bigger. Even on my heavy where I normally I use a .50 cal or .308 lmg, I still use my instigating explosive one for singular kills. They are that efficient :)
---
[Stealth Rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f235ff&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl2cu2ld1lr1l71lt2lk2lv2a71ar1an2a04a32ib4eh1s60&amp;n=Stealth rifleman)  
---
This is completely min maxed damage output for a V.A.T.S. rifle build.
---
Take some addictions extra 50 damage
---
Its just an arrow pointing to our location unfortunately.
---
Thanks I am trying to grind up on PlayStation also so I appreciate it. Send me your gt and we can play together on PlayStation
---
I'm enjoying Daily Ops, as well. I'm a bloodied stealth build on several characters--and, even so, have adapted to the game mode. I'm also glad that they added the new group type--otherwise it would be very difficult to find others to join.
---
Better yet, give them to struggling new players.
---
The chemist backpack is amazing, freed up so much carryweight on my person and in my stash cuz I emptied out all my chems, and I don't have space in STR for the actual pharmacy perk.
---
I don't care much about the grocer/thru-hiker since I just immediately eat whatever I kill, thanks to carnivore and cannibal.
---
I actually converted all my loose ammo the other day and I dread having to do that again.
---
They need to!!! Brickhouse's Famous Shotgun makes me giggle bc it isn't famous. Hopefully Steel Dawn will bring more lore in
---
Servers will be worse than they already are.
---
Hmm
---
Vampire weapons were key for my survival as a bloodied unyielding build. I have a vampire gause shotgun
---
hey, free ammo and exp. plus shooting things is fun.
---
That's what people really want. Or simply that Beth increase the stash to 1200 or 1600. :)
---
I gave it a try and had the opposite. Seemed every time I logged in it gave me one a minute later. I was always at 4 or maxed out. I found in the end, rather carry the water and meats.
---
Me too..... I‚Äôm only doing them now for the daily and xp.  I kind of wish it wasn‚Äôt a daily..
---
Scrapper is where it is at for steel.  I used to have to farm it all the time.  Now I never need to!  And it's only one star.
---
Took me more than 2 minutes after the 2nd uplink to finish the final room. Thanks for the tip, I think I‚Äôll switch to Vats.
---
I mean 8min of non stop shooting....sign me up at least twice a day.  Plus I walk out with more ammo and stims than I started.  I dont even want the rewards besides the symptomatic.
---
Maybe for you, when you main a .50 cal the ammo does not add up at all, you get 4-16 ammo a kill and at the end 300...like wtf the only gun that uses that is a fucking automatic heavy gun like how does that add up???
---
What the heck is in that vendor?! üòÇ
---
That's a lotta dross toss
---
If you're under level 50 you aren't going to get the rare rewards, just rewards that already exist on the world.
---
I agree. I love doing them. I just wish my luck was a little better I guess!ü§£
---
If yoy cannot g we t into lucky hole mine with the excavator PA run to the responders fire station and there are often lead weights having out in the weight room.  Also, the top monorail elevator, but that is right next to lucky hole mine.
---
i get lost in that place so easily
---
I was on last night at midnight.
---
Except 50cal ammo is so easy to get now with Ammo Factory lvl 2, Ammosmith and super duper fully ranked. One lot of junk nets x360 50 cal rounds.
---
That's why I'm thinking about just using my VPN to play on EU/US servers.
---
Because it is affecting my gameplay, specifically when I'm trying to help friends do things legitimately like SBQ, Earle and the Sheepsquach Assaultron event. 
---
We've had over 10 bosses be unlootable over the past two days because of it. 
---
I'd get it, if the users of the illegitimate weapons just held back for a few seconds but lately they've been somewhat "Griefy" about how they're using the weapons. 
---
Literally killing SBQ the second she spawns, 
---
Killing Sheepsquach whilst it's invisible
---
And then Abusing the PA glitch to get to EARLE before the timer is up and then killing him the second they get down there.
---
It's honestly not my idea of fun, which is why I'm asking if other areas are having the issue. Because I'll just move over to a more legitimate player-base.
---
Wouldn't mind the rug. With me it's Earl and the mining helmet. My friend had it drop.
---
I thought I got a electro hatchet plan but I said no that was prob from uranium fever. But I guess I did, being I got kicked to dash board when I was looting so I couldn‚Äôt see what I got. Just got into one and only got second tier and got nothing. Hopefully when I hit elder I‚Äôll get something decent. I‚Äôve gotten vault 94 outfit plan 3 times in a row, liquid courage recipe 1, and burrow sign plan. Did have a awesome person build the symptomatic at my camp. I did get two legendaries even tho they where junk. But free scrip, even tho I have 4 million pounds of scrip I can‚Äôt scrip being I have a 150 daily scrip limit
---
I worked my butt off forever trying to get that Deathclaw that spawned in the Mire but once I got there, that‚Äôs when I realized it wasn‚Äôt alone
---
Ive learned to only shoot what's griefing me. The rest I run past.
---
They're fantastic for the game and I love that 6mins is all they take to clear. Not like spongey Earl and all that BS.
---
I‚Äôm not a PA user and can confirm that this stagger effect can occur even when not in combat/haven‚Äôt been in combat for ages
---
I want to know so I can help!  ü§î
---
Ahhh...I didn't realize that. That kind of sucks for anyone under level 50. If they are going to make plans restricted to one character they shouldn't lock low levels out IMO.
---
we need a 1 timeline to go w/ 1 wateland haha
---
I think the quantity is more or less the same for every ammo type? that's also the reason why a lot of us go bloodied, because you don't have to worry about mats as much.
---
I use a vampire's flamer and end up with a net positive. don't even need to bring the bloodied one out.
---
Also, if they gave atoms after it's completed the people who use atoms to skip the levels could have weeks or even months to get those atoms back and Bethesda won't want that and the naysayers would yell pay to win. It would however be nice if they would give something for the challenges for early completers even if it was stuff like the supply kits. Maybe they could put a repeatable slot at the end after the big package.
---
It's like a lot of things in the game. It's just half assed and lazy.
---
Your characters likely know all about Armor Ace. 
---
You as the player don‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs a new addition to the lore.
---
I once saw a scorched mirelurk king beating the living shit out of a mutfruit plant. Beautiful.
---
Good question. I've done 4 dailies and not a single rate drop
---
On the map it shows me having it incomplete
---
I pretty much aced it tonight and still it took almost 10 minutes solo.   Not sure why because I destroyed all the enemies and ran from uplink to uplink.  The final boss did take his sweet time showing up.
---
I've received rare drops half the time. It's RNG
---
Maybe it's chinese gi joe
---
It‚Äôs very unlikely any further growth in stash will occur, as it can cause a whole host of issues to occur... not to mention the game needs to be fixed overall before they can look at these sorts of quality of life improvements
---
[removed]
---
Welcome to Fallout 76. "You should just know." Enjoy.
---
Apologies, my point was that it is, by definition, a grind, and fair for others to call it such.  That noted, many can enjoy grinding.  I know I spent a good 1.5 years just working on random gear in Destiny 2 before I grew tired of the grind.
---
The main issue here is Bethesda released the game full of bugs, has had a shotty history of accepting their blame, as well as a growing number of concerning cash grabs via fridges and 'kits' in the atom shop.  The main issue I have personally is that we were told they wouldn't do exactly what they are doing with this game.  I know they lost money on it, but that still doesn't excuse some of their recent tactics, imo at least as i realize this is a subjective issue and mileage varies for all.
---
This. I hit level 15 a few hrs ago and im driving an entire clip of .38 into scorched and an entire mag of 10mm into those bloodborne nut jobs. Also melee has gotten nuts. The only thing keeping me alive is my stockpile of stems and Psycho
---
LOL! The awesomeness of nature!
---
Your build looks solid, the only thing I could question would be the choice of good with salt. Is there a reason you couldn‚Äôt use the refrigerated backpack in its place? That would allow you to run bloodied mess and get an instant increase in damage.
---
Overall your build is just going to struggle in most situation like daily ops. There is just no way to makeup the loss of sneak bonuses for single shot rifle builds. Maybe an anti armor rifle would help, but it‚Äôs unlikely. My best advice is to just never run them outside of a team. You need someone else to tank damage while you sit back and give support damage.
---
It sucks but that is going to be the meta until piercing glaze is no longer a default mutation.
---
As far as weak spots: Gutsy - eyes, robobrains - head, protectrons - body, assaultron - body, sentry bots - fusion cores (bank a crit then hover on the cores until you get a single percent hit chance). These aren‚Äôt technically the best, but they are the spots I find most easily targeted.
---
Yeah its SO. FRUSTRATING!
---
Damn. I'm on Xbox so if anyone can craft it for I would LOVE IT.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôd do swarm of suiters if there was legendary mirelurk queen at the end and make it a f*ckin battle... hell make it so you have to nuke toxic valley to start swarm of suiters and it spawns a giant mirelurk queen, or if free range guaranteed a 3* sheepsquatch, or if tea time had chances for easy 1* spawns (wolf horde in the forest has better rewards than tea time)... lode bearing... I got nothin... maybe a boss fight type of thing with a motherload drill.
---
It looks like Armor Ace is the power armor wearing guy on the board. I agree it would be good to get posters and stuff to elaborate on this. And Platinum‚Äôs costume
---
I VATs + Shotgun them.
---
Do they disappear when you log out?
---
Shotgun. Bugs‚Äô body parts mostly turn into acid when scrapped which is a valuable resource although common.
---
Your previous pet leaves when you get a new one (a prompt will appear letting you know)
---
Dude I lag hard when I even open my stash
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed any considerable difference? I run a full set of Secret Service armor (not a bloodied/junkies build) and haven‚Äôt noticed any significant damage change to my character. The SBQ has become a bit spongier and loves to absorb more ammo, but that was to be expected with One Wasteland
---
I've never dealt with a YSJK in this game until this lmao
---
This. There are presumably thousands of comics and tv shows we don‚Äôt know about because it‚Äôd be impossible to cover all of them, making it possible for infinite possibilities of future ‚Äòcontent‚Äô in this capacity
---
Edit: damn I said possible way too many times lol
---
Exactly as you say and Crits not registering for me if under a certain hit percentage too.
---
It really is terrible. I came back at the beginning of the season and the first time I tried to use it I was like, holy shit they made it WORSE.
---
  
---
I promptly scrapped it.
---
That‚Äôs just pure evil lmao Jesus
---
I took out an entire paragraph about "who tf or what tf is Armor Ace itself?" bc yeah, AA is the power armor guy. There is a pretty decent wiki page explaining what little info exists lol
---
Strange, I‚Äôm not seeing this at all.
---
I do the same thing, not in pa though and seems fine. I wanted to see how hard the 100 mire lurk queen hits without blocker on. I went from full to around 10%, so I'm happy. With perks pretty much nothing can get me but maybe Earl's feet.
---
Maybe they are tired of watching angry turtle disciples running around in pa with the perk.
---
It feels really good when you finish it fast but I can do without that rare rug.
---
They won‚Äôt give out atoms but I‚Äôd be happy with repair kits,scrap kits or 100 caps per level after I complete a scoreboard.
---
The Market Value GI Joe
---
My character needs to speak tf up then bc I am curious.
---
Gratz I hit L200 a few days ago I've been playing just over a month
---
Then I must have the worst fuckin luck cause I haven't gotten any of the rare colossal problem rewards or any of the rare rewards for this shit
---
Thats awesome
---
But, that mother fucker pays out 11 scrip every damn day!
---
How about do it directly for treasury notes
---
There‚Äôs a perk card for them.
---
I‚Äôve level up at least two times during only a couple hours. So I know I get at least 2000 or 3000 everyday. Shit is so easy this season
---
250, sold 70
---
Also if you need a comsistent stream of stimpacks, gthere is a little lake next to an oil node in the savage devide the lake has some bloodleaves and on the other side of ut us a statick tick spawn point. It has a dead radstag or gou lai cant remember with an xbow a dead settler below a cliff a few meters away from the water. Ut one of the best spota to live if you play a non-ammo hungry build (i got molly shotgun pa dude, its great)
---
I wanna know why they didn‚Äôt just use existing board games from the game already like catch the commie.
---
That is a bug for sure because if you have no working/powered vending machines at your camp the icon goes from a coin looking icon to the flask looking icon I mentioned before. As far as the ally not working they are useless for me 90% of the time as well (they never seem to respond to mobs attacking the camp). I was under the impression that was an intended nerf (so if you have not set up turrets at strategic locations you have more risk losing all or most of your camp to random attacks).
---
I aspire to be this one day xD
---
Try to either find a good melee or a Gatling gun. Gatling guns are probably the most efficient weapon ammo-wise in the game (5mm rounds grow on trees it seems) and melee obviously doesn‚Äôt require any ammo.
---
You need to be on a private team with them.
---
Note you cannot build atom shop items in a friends camp.
---
2500 not including weeklies at least
---
Only for private groups, could never build in public groups
---
Going through my last challenges now, as I bought the last 7 levels of last season amd want a backup plan again, just in case...
---
You can in a non public team
---
No more boardgame/cartoon shit, please.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt even be wearing T-60. It was mentioned nowhere in the original fallouts, and in the earlier fallouts they used T-51. Even in this game it is mentioned in holotapes that the brotherhood used T-51
---
Grahm He Travels Around
---
OK im dumb, how do I make a private team?
---
Ohhh thanks, duh maybe I should put my glasses on. üòÇüòÇ
---
Already been doubled once, and there are a whole slew of weight reduction and/or increased weight abilities or mods.if you're hoarding legendary weapons or mass amounts of junk  just make another character to store them on.
---
Just enter build mode inside their camp. Whatever button you press and hold to do so in your own camp. You have to be on a team. You cannot edit what the owner has placed, but you can place things yourself and it will use your own resources, but the owner's budget.
---
You can, you need to be in a private group
---
Rifleman vs SM that rush my CAMP can say the hits aren't connecting whether stealth or in open. They have their Richocet Perk Card equipped I suspect since I know a Hunting Rifle hip fired by a running SM couldn't be hitting me more often than my 95% Vats Crit hit from Handmade was doing to him.
---
Well i havnt played with my buds in a few months, but you should just be able to join their team. Then go to their camp and build away
---
Can we just have the ability to type in prices?
---
Maybe your luck and charisma have something to do with that? Along with rng of course.
---
Ward Murder spree
---
If you are on a team you can. Not a public team, a regular one. If you have the contractor perk you can build stuff for way less cost, looking at you rad shower.....
---
Is that true? What's your source on that?
---
2237.5 per day assuming 100 days
---
A level 10 noob angry about the new update
---
Doesn‚Äôt work with shotties unfortunately. Take it from a shotgunner‚Äôs personal frustration.
---
Yeah, there are some rare plans in the loot table for some of the treasure maps.
---
Exactly, "invite to team" via the social menu without going into a public team. This is the "old way" of teaming and allows building in team mates camps and entering locked doors.
---
Personally, as a solo player I wouldn't mind getting a little bit of a break. I don't play it on any teams because I'm too embarrassed. I'm the one that gets lost in every single location and I could only imagine what would happen if I had other players involved in this misadventure. So at this point I shall continue playing solo and just have a sense of relief every time I reach initiate level! üòâ
---
Shotgun machinegun.  I love legacies
---
I've gotten them like every day
---
Stash was 400 at one time. Fallout 1st is available. You don‚Äôt need to hoard a bunch of crap.
---
I use them for item bindings in mobas. I don't consider it a macro if it's only executing a single action
---
I'm still dying to try and find one on Xbox. üò≠
---
As a solo player that repeatedly gets lost in every single location, no matter how many times I have run the event, there is no way I am going to subject myself to the humiliation of putting on this performance in front of others! üòÇ
---
I have 0, ZERO, null, interest in nukashine.
---
I still do them because they give treasury notes and XP.
---
Jailbreak is awesome now.

I noticed Melee Vats won't let my character strike enemy idk 10-25% of the time. I have died spamming the attack button in Vats.
---
No.
---
I would lose thru hiker and put those points to max sneak and rank up adrenaline. Lose good with salt and max tormentor. Make sure you're always using concentrated fire on the enemy weakness. Heads on most, combat inhibitor on robos, blowhole on grafton monster, etc. And of course always be crouched.
---
Power armour is garbage. You lose all your legendary bonuses. Find some vanguard ap refresh and sentinel is you can get it.....
---
When you invite people to your team just don‚Äôt start a public then a bite just go to the social menu and inv from there
---
I've been using the score 10k xp to keep track of it, and it went off like, 3 times in one level.
---
A mini nuke as a reward literally means you have to open your pip biy to drop it lol. That's the reward.
---
From the social menu "invite to team", whilst NOT in a public team. It's a little confusing, because if you are already in a public team (even on your own) all you do is invite them to the public team. This is the old method of teaming up in fo76 and allows access through locked doors and building in team mates camps. You can build but cannot change anything the camp owner has built.
---
What level are you?  Pa is most definitely not garbage
---
Also a cooking station. Sometimes I forget to check if I have all my food buffs ready... There's even a bunch of cooking pots, salt, pepper, etc in the little trailer in the pre-fight room.
---
They did confirm some new raider content to do with the Brotherhood, but it is indeed unlikely that much new things will happen with them considering how seperate the camping and alcohol quests are from everything else!
---
I don't use any CAMP exploits if that's what you mean. I used a already in game building and have no power armor bench or rad shower. I don't use power armor and I'm a bloodied build so nixed those from my CAMP. You can make consessions. All the crafting stuff you need can be found at Whiterun, can always do that stuff there and leave all crafting items out of your CAMP budget.
---
Hey! 6 foot distance!
---
You screwed up by not sending Todd a cut of that gameflip chedda.
---
Favorited!!! Aaaand somthing to do tonight tyty ü§ôüèª
---
I need a Gauss rifle Vats fix. I just traded for a Legacy one and my Floater grenades stick better than the rifle does.
---
Bar‚Äôs open....got the good stuff right here!
---
Nothing makes sense anymore and these lands are lawless. The only thing i can think of is higher int lessens the xp required as well? I don't have any evidence supporting that though.
---
Can you buy the plans from other players? I‚Äôm having terrible RNG for the plans
---
Theres a perk in luck called Scrounger that lets you find extra ammo in boxes, that can be pretty handy.
---
Glowing blood topping sold separately, discount applies in store for orders no less than 200 caps.
---
That would be crazy.  The only other option is that the score challenge isn't actually 10k xp
---
They really need to separate vending machines and containers from the stash box, it's the main causes of server lag.
---
My opinion?   
---
Okay well since I am already pushing rank 30. A LOT that is how much you should have per day.   
---
Personally I run full unyielding each piece has +1 int .That is followed up by 100% lunchboxes +25% from cranberry relish +15% from inspirational +5% from lover's embrace, +5% from bobble or live and love #8 (I space them out to not deplete my stock to fast) brain fungus soup for 5 int or brain bombs if I happen to have the material for 8 int. Then the mutations and shielded casual I end up with 51-54 int at so another at least 106%  for 256% the level 100 hermit crab nets me just shy of 4k xp mirelurk queens are 2800 ish.   
---
I farm the bog 4 queens at least 1 hermit crab 1-2 death claws (same xp as queen) you run past event/spawn locations for how I do my circuit so you get randos including maxed out sheep squatches. If rad rumble or project paradise pop I rush to it and start it then just farm from there.   
---
I average 1000 score per hour playing when I am focused and not dicking around with friends or helping my son.
---
Oh wow it was that easy! Thanks all!!!
---
I'm running a highly mobile sprinting style unarmed, so here's some general info. I don't use anything meta (just an instigating deathclaw), and I don't use PA cuz you just can't punch things in PA lol.
---
PERKS:  
---
STR:  
---
-Blocker is very nice, 45% melee damage reduction  
---
-Barbarian can give up to +80 DR at 20 STR  
---
-With 9 out of 15 points set up for your 2H perks, that only leaves you with 2 more full 3-star perks, so you could run blocker + barbarian for maximum defense, but Incisor (75% armor penetration) is just too good to pass up. Martial Artist is nice for the swing speed though too. You could go with Incisor and then swap Barbarian and Blocker out depending on if you're fighting ranged or melee enemies.
---
END:  
---
-Ironclad can give +50 DR/ER  
---
-Lifegiver can give you +45 more HP - I think it's nice now since everything does more damage   
---
-Rejuvinated doubles the Well Fed/Hydrated bonus, so if you keep up your food you can get +50 more HP (I also run the cannibal perk + carnivore mutation to just eat everything I kill)  
---
-Fireproof: can sometimes be needed, stops you from being on fire  
---
CHA:
---
-Strange in Numbers: boosts all your mutations, IF you have another mutated teammate - very nice effect though.  
---
-Suppressor lowers your target's damage output as long as you keep hitting it, up to -30% damage. Not bad for single target, less useful for groups of enemies.  
---
-Field Medic makes your stimpaks heal about 45% faster, IIRC - very nice in combo with Born Survivor or just in general  
---
AGI:  
---
-Evasive grants up to +45 DR/ER at 15 AGI  
---
-Dodgy grants an additional 30% damage reduction, but costs 30AP every time you get hit. It can be good for enemies who hit hard, but not often, but otherwise not good for groups of enemies cuz you'll instantly be out of AP.  
---
-Born Survivor just rank 1 really, auto-stim at 20% HP is nice cuz there's no animation so you can't get interrupted at least  
---
-White Knight slows armor decay by 60% and greatly reduces repair costs. Very nice to stretch out your repair pit stops and resources from undoing all the damage you take.  
---
LCK:  
---
-Starched Genes stops you from losing mutations  
---
-Class Freak reduces mutation penalties by 75%  
---
-Ricochet gives you an 18% chance to reflect a bullet back at the enemy. The damage reflected is minimal, but when the bullet is reflected, you don't take damage from it (IIRC) - so it can be nice for turrets and enemies with miniguns or other rapid firing weapons. It can be nice, but not really needed.
---
MUTATIONS (you'll want Class Freak, Starched Genes, and Strange in Numbers):  
---
-Twisted Muscles grants +25% (+33% with Strange in Numbers) melee damage, increased chance to cripple limbs  
---
-Scaly Skin gives +50 DR/ER (+63 with Strange in Numbers)  
---
-Empath is sorta weird, you take more damage, but everyone on the team takes less damage... which includes you. With Class Freak + Strange in numbers, you take +8% damage but also take -33% while on a team, so a net gain of 25% damage reduction.  
---
-Grounded: +100 ER (+125 with Strange in Numbers)
---
LEGENDARY PERKS:
---
-Taking One for the Team: while you're on a team, any enemy who is attacking you takes +10/20/30/40% more damage from all sources, which includes you. So it can help you and your allies down whatever enemy you're currently tanking.
---
GEAR:  
---
-The Secret Service underarmor can have +4 STR/END put on it with the shielded lining. Highly recommend it.
---
As am I. I enjoy new lore for this game, and would love to see more of this. 
---
Ideally, I‚Äôd want my character to be able to find holotapes or videos of the Armor Ace and The Power Patrol to be able to listen or watch on their camp.
---
No, I dont mean that. I mean that I dont have THAT much at my camp yet I'm full somehow, so I dont have the budget left to decorate that much lol
---
And here I had just thought it was a Chinese Officer in stealth armour!
---
Have you hidden the quests on your map?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasnt. I actually found it a little unusual it was happening so much but i wasnt questioning it until now.
---
Fallout 1st doesn't increase stash space.
---
And if they want us to build camps we need shit to store Fallout has always been about looting
---
Do you have the latest game and system updates installed?
---
Right?
---
Awesome, love the expression!
---
Definitely. Sitting on a bunch of unspendable bullion now. Getting perk card packs or perk coins for completing like 5 dailies would be nice too, we definitely need a way to generate coins outside levelling. You can only claim those perk card packs on the scoreboard for one character...
---
i havent seen a hostile mob lower than 50 anywhere on the map
---
But food and water is literally everywhere, i'd rather become a near immortal god with all the other legendary perks available.
---
I actually deal with the thief and he end up paying me.
---
Unless it's a blood eagle asshole.
---
Can't reason with them.
---
I think it's in Appliances.  
---
Once you find it, stick it somewhere out of the way. It has it's own power source. After I turn in all I can I get rid of the rest b/c people don't buy ammo from my shop anymore.
---
Ok so this happened after you were on last night? Then it isn't JUST the increase difficulty from the update. 
---
I was going t ask if you added some new legendary perks and maybe. That changed your squishiness but I can't think of any card that would do that.
---
What config file?
---
It‚Äôs an honor to be in the same subreddit as you, Mr. Heston.
---
Need more adrenaline, chems, and bock. The rail rifle can hit harder but no stealth. Gun fu doesn't really pan out but you have so much agility, might as well. Might want to do 15 in luck for crits too and get that stat up. I use heavy in daily ops. The i lever can one hit things in the meditation event, but it's slow and if someone shows up with an explosive you aren't getting anything xD Carry multiple guns and you can cover it all.
---
LOL I have done this too
---
I did this exact thing.  I removed all my cards and the dmg was 110.  I put them all back on and I was at 116.  Obviously I git boosts from somewhere else but regardless...60% of base is a constant and those cards should always change the damage by the same anount.
---
This.  I already use specific food for it's benefits, not just to keep hunger up.
---
I despise these Daily Ops. I feel forced to play with people as a predominantly solo anti social person. Glad you people with friends and social skills are having fun. Solo people stand no chance getting through this without blowing a massive amount of stims and gear condition. I'm sure I'll be down voted, but idc. These are bull shit for solo players
---
This is why I‚Äôm not using that perk on my main. I enjoy the food buffs and they‚Äôre easy enough to acquire. 
---
Now, for my mule?  Perhaps.
---
Maybe your controller is busted, but you sound like a whiny baby.
---
I've seen more people.
---
I'll see less again for a while after Meat Week as people stock up on their notes with it.
---
I think this is it from here on out üò≠ 
---
Bet the next will be Unstoppables or Astoundingly Awesome Tales
---
I know this already. This was not my melee build, I know it would be better to run the correct perks. This is just what I had equipped at the time. I can just run all 3 maxed cards if I want.
---
I can tell you, that I did this almost at the same exact time. 8:14. And I didn‚Äôt waste any time. I ran and ran. Stood next to the signal thingy the whole time I was supposed to, didn‚Äôt die either. But I barely missed it each time.(solo ). So far, today, my best was 8 minutes and 14 seconds. After a few times, I just ended up dropping a nuke on Earle. So you‚Äôre not alone. And just to make this clear, I am fully spec‚Äôd for bloodied commando, and was using my bloodied explosive handmade. In no way am I complaining, I like a challenge. Just saying you aren‚Äôt the only one.
---
I stay away. Tea Time and Campfire Tales are a horror show now.
---
So? They've never had a point to begin with.
---
Like the animations? Keep them. Think they're worth scrapping for extra coins? Get rid of em.
---
I've had this problem for weeks now, have you had any luck?
---
So I am a bit of a freak as I work from home so I have the day to be playing.  Currently at rank 75, the xp weekly is great for people like me constantly running nukes or events and whatnot.
---
Found these videos, yeah they are using something that blow up really fast but i don't see anyone shooting.
---
For some it's look like they just using the plasma cal50 when they have an bounty, correct me if I'm wrong but bounty on your head make you hostile again everyone including camp ? (You can't kill someone just because you have an bounty but if i'm right, they patch the hostile action from electric charge when someone with an bounty get hit by this)
---
Pretty sure this carried over from FO4.  I remember being really annoyed trying to loot with a follower wandering by.  I don't even know why they would have the item interaction start from behind your character in the first place
---
This is a New controller and u got a problem or something?
---
Finally, someone with the Guts to help.
---
I turn his pencil into bullets and bullets into corpses and corpses into scrip and scrip into poop.  It's the cycle of Murmrgh.
---
Man I hate assaultrons
---
There's sometimes input lag or a delay. I have the same issue on Xbox One.
---
Also, asking for help with shitty attitude won't get you very far for very long.
---
Got Elder every day here, and got no rare rewards since the patch dropped.
---
I has to be a bug, because statisticians will tell you that the likelihood of something like this happening legitimately is *infinitesimally* small.
---
I dig it,&amp; agree that it seems morning cartoon circa 1987.
---
Brick ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù
---
Oh RoadBlock,from G.IJoe,gotcha
---
I agree OP,but I ain‚Äôt gonna lie,I dig the F out of it!
---
Even more so,hopin they expand In game,In some way!
---
Just don‚Äôt make em the Brotherhood faction that are,on there way to Appalachia.
---
I ‚Äúmight‚Äù be bummed.
---
Edit,*
---
Yeah.
---
I removed some stealth perks and replaced them with: 
---
Adrenaline 1
---
GunFu 1
---
Action boy 3
---
Dodgy 3
---
And it works well.
---
I had to take that camp skin off my C.A.M.P and I replaced my camp for caps and it worked perfect thank god
---
Only time it doesn't work for me is for a few seconds after firing a wind-up weapon like the Minigun, but especially the Gatling Plasma. That might be working as intended though.
---
Maybe Morgantown was nuked. And it had just dissipated but the enemy spawns hadn't caught up?
---
Idk, just spitballing. Obviously one wasteland shouldn't have those there normally, maybe glowing ones but they shouldn't have been that higher than you but I think nukes still have a minimum.
---
Oh wow maybe I'll learn a life lesson on reddit
---
Most try hard PVP players are using bugged "magic" weapons or oh so cheesy legacy's.
---
Certain times in the day means less people doing events. Same for nukes, that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
I was using a gattling laser hmm
---
Rats are stupidly too powerful now.
---
Oh yeah, you learn to... like im running towards it, and jump way early so I land right on the platforms next to the scrip machines...   it's just getting used to it at first.
---
Tighter places you just have to float a bit and it takes longer to get into tight spots, but its still worth the extra hassle.
---
I did mind a random harden mass on the ground and was wondering if it was nuked previously. That would have to explain it
---
It increases your hit chance with each consecutive shot fired. That said the percentage it shows isn't indicative of landing a shot.
---
Ôº¢ÔΩåÔΩÅÔΩöÔΩÖ ÔΩâÔΩî
---
Go online with any other game then go online with 76.
---
From my experience the enemies scale to and above your own level. The new scaling system is hit and miss for me since I get making the game a challenge for all the players who are lv100+ but it requires an absurd amount of ammo until you finish your character build.
---
Personally I think the SPECIAL cards are underrated.
---
Yup, you have to wait for the barrel to stop spinning
---
Oh fuck no, RIP my carry weight xD
---
This is a good idea. Would keep the bullion currency relevant for players who have purchased everything they want already. I heard today you can buy lunchboxes for bullion at foundation now too.
---
Friend request sent. thank you so very much
---
Well that's annoying damn
---
Heh I only have 1 rare reward so far (caged lights)
---
I've never in my entire time in this game played with my mic on, so I have no idea of other players approve of my nuke choices or not. They just stand there staring at me. Maybe they're yapping at me? Ignorance is bliss!
---
They have to test their builds somehow.
---
My main has Luck and another SPECIAL I can't remember. I'd rather use those as they add a lot  more functionality at max levels.    
---
It has the Chemist backpack mod and I have at minimum 300+ Purified Water, 200+ Radaway both versions. I had a lot of chems and sold most of them. That one is a Herbivore so meats are sold.I'm almost at 16k caps and have little need to make big purchases.    
---
Since my main is 122, then my other char has Luck, Master Infiltrator, and another SPECIAL. IMO the second one is best for new players who'll be able to get more stuff faster. The minigames aren't that bad.
---
I don't know why that camp skin causes so many issues. But I'll do that, thanks!
---
its time for a 100 lb account wide mailbox already...
---
Yes, I have a problem with shitty assholes who come here asking for help and bringing their equally shitty attitude instead of doing a 30 second google check.
---
Yea I‚Äôm thinking going full chem food buff and try if I can finish the final room faster.
---
Well, the purpose is as follows. Look at what shirt you are wearing.
---
If you are wearing a red shirt, fire red lasers at the blue team.
---
If you are wearing a blue shirt, fire blue lasers at the red team.
---
If you are colorblind... well, just start firing randomly and hope for the best.
---
So, I've tested this a bit (solo), and it turns out the progress bar on the nodes is a bit buggy.
---
There's a known bug where it gets stuck altogether (there's videos of that floating around), but it can also just take forever to fill up sometimes. Had one take 5 minutes all by itself, even though my face was pressed up against it the entire time (I didn't bother fighting, I just tanked the damage).
---
First, good one, I laughed out loud and my wife made me read the post to her.  Second, find a woman who doesn't mind sharing you with Appalachia, no Vault Dweller needs that that kind of negativity in thier lives. Lol.  I'm only at 820 hours so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.
---
8:10 on my onky solo today... so close.
---
Someone joined on my second and we got elder easy enough
---
Lethally annoying.  I recommend a vampire gun
---
Can't wait to upgrade to PC23 whenever I can get my hands on a 3080.
---
Better yet have a good way to transfer loot between characters, I‚Äôm all for having mule characters to store my stuff but needing another player to transfer is difficult and requires a lot of trust.
---
You're welcome.
---
Oh so I make a vague comment about post flair u cuss me out and I'm the asshole?
---
The initial VATS number that shows is bupkis like you said, but the subsequent %ages seem legit. When it ultimately gets to 95% it almost never misses (if the target isn't already dead by then).
---
Do you not read the cards you use?
---
Remove the porch, place the floor, then put the porch back. It's the only way.
---
99% of scrap used to build CAMP items is kept in the F1st Stash box, which has unlimited storage.
---
The 3080s are insane
---
It's a great thing they still expand in-game pop culture. I'd love to see Tragic the Garnering ‚Ñ¢  CCD to be re-implemented somewhere in the future.
---
Also, HAIL VIPER!
---
Some things take more space than others, some premade CAMP buildings, turrets etc. If all else fails it may just be bugged. Scrap it all, move CAMP from and then back to your current location (if you like it) and start fresh.
---
I'm bracing myself for them to lower the ammo drops at some point. I'm up to 7000 for my Gauss shotgun.
---
Yep. You got it, buckaroo. Acting like a child is a sure fire way to get treated like a child.
---
That‚Äôs a bummer, I ran 3 times without any server latency issue. There running sure takes more time than other places especially the final room, beating this solo in elder will be so satisfying tho.
---
They could have radio episodes or even give some use to those TVs we have for our camp.
---
Hell yeah they are. I have maxed out Luck and two points in Strength and Intelligence. That means I have 9 more special points. I can thrown on bloody mess and ricochet now as well as maxed blocker and maxed demo expert. Its amazing to have the extra room. I can't wait to max them all out!
---
Have you tried removing the porch then placing the tiles before putting the porch back?
---
Vampire weapon. I had never needed one until now, since the Daily Ops are not about killing, but about enduring punishment. 
---
Good thing I had a mule with over 30 vampire weapons to choose from. If you find a vampire tesla, shotgun, combat rifle, machine gun, SMG... They're all good for Daily Ops.
---
Just take a 5-strip of acid and go to a Build-a-Bear.
---
Lol ur lack of self awareness is crazy
---
Technically you didn't need to beat Zorbo. That was just a themed indicator for how long the season was gonna last.
---
My worst gripe with the UI is that it doesn‚Äôt reset the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù when getting set back to the main ammo page. Sometimes you need to back-out of more than 50+ navigations.
---
Even at level 0 you don‚Äôt need food or water, it takes longer than 30 mins to get to the red zone. You just wasted 300 perk points
---
I did west tek on a fresh level at level 229. I got around 2/3rds of a level. It seems I got around 20,000-25,000 experience in the run. I don't really know what to make of this. It seems like it takes 30,000~xp per level now, but under double xp a few months ago I was getting the same xp amounts per mutants as I'm getting now, and as a level 150~ it only took me 2 west tek runs to level up like its doing now. I am really confused. That datamine is old but I don't remember ever hearing about them changing it.
---
No worries it‚Äôs just a challenge I give myself haha. I‚Äôm a junkie when it comes to speed clear challenges. Totally doable since there are people that complete it. I just need to find out why I can‚Äôt :(
---
[https://imgur.com/8kfz49D](https://imgur.com/8kfz49D)
---
Do it in a team, it's way faster. Did it solo today cause noone joins and being part of another team gives the luffagus a kick option.
---
Pretty easy time but put a lot of thought into my characters even this alt. All you do is sprint to each location, don't leave 1x bonus area. Clean the last area fast, kill boss. Not much else.
---
Should add- my main ran it with another group today and the girl was absolutely fabulous! She sprinted ahead of me right to the end boss, then his face went around to the back of his ass.
---
Don't rush the quests as you can quickly get under levelled just running through them. Spend time exploring the map and collecting scrap as you go. Learn how to tag scrap you need/use for search so that it's easier to find through the world.
---
Check this [out](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3c24x/essential_tips_for_new_players/). It has a bunch of the basics including where to farm things. One thing I'd say I didn't know while starting out is how much events can be an ammo sink while starting out. I'd recommend not joining any events marked harder than easy and even so mostly when there are already others in the event until you have a reliable way of getting ammo.
---
Enjoy your time in the wastelands! If you're on xbox I can help you out with some basic weapons and ammo.
---
It worked you guys are genius! Building my basketball court now
---
Thank you so much it worked!!
---
Maybe they changed it in patch 22
---
Your lack of basic etiquette is crazy.
---
Grow up, child.
---
Yeah, seems like it's more useful now that follow up shots are usually needed. At max range the percentages aren't as reliable.
---
Congratulations. You're even unluckier than I am.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
If they added the cards as collectibles or perk cards! 
---
Or even a D&amp;D style board for Seasons!
---
True, weekly limits are a thing but as the content ages they even lift those restrictions in favor of new currency with the cap and so on.
---
I did this on 9/20 and can confirm that shooting through the holes in the shed and killing Caleb first caused the key to teleport up and spawn on Surge's body. It was a pain in the ass, but it worked and I was able to proceed.
---
Honestly it's easier to just sell it in the vendor nowadays. If you have Ammo Factory maxed alongside  Ammo Smith and Superduper, the Ammo converter is really obsolete.
---
To be fair I use fusion cores exclusively so I literally have no reason to use it. I should probably cash out for some .50 cal and .308 and sell them in my vendor, those always sell out nearly instantly.
---
Maybe that's why I never noticed it before. I was one-shotting pretty much everything before the patch.
---
Game over, go home
---
Is that a harpoon gun? üëÄ
---
I jumped to a horde event at prime and found 2 legendary SB fighting the anally gaster horde and a high level glowing deathclaw. I got everything but the 2* SB  because it kept melting me and respawning. I was on my alt so kinda under prepared ammo wise but I swear the 2* damage to me was hardcore scaled up.
---
No, because Bethesda doesn't like us having nice things.
---
I finally managed to get the key. I had always used stealth in my previous attempts. This time I made sure to never use stealth and to get noticed by all the raiders. This time when I entered the cooling tower area, Fisher along with some raiders and guard dogs who had always been unreachable in the locked room with Lev before, were now on the ground level and able to be engaged. After fighting through everyone to the top of the cooling tower, I killed Surge and this time he had the Hideout Key on him. Not sure if this approach was the fix or if Bethesda fixed something. Just glad I finally got the key and move on.
---
Short version, add more dps.
---
For you that's luck ... and maybe chem fiend etc. In addition, legendary follow through perk. Consider Mr sandman as a swap too.
---
EDIT: It didn‚Äôt look like you had Bloody Mess either.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do using yours as a base
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f6359c&amp;d=xa1x90x82x40sb2pd2pk2pl2pp2p02cu0ce0ic4a72an2ar0a00lu2l71a30a80lt2lk2lv0eh2es2s01sg2l12xm0xp0&amp;m=051c249fe87ba6&amp;am=162937-162532-122436-12213a-122431&amp;wp=w5w5&amp;wm=1k2532-1i2835
---
I run a build very similar. A few things I‚Äôd suggest.
---
 - DPS comes from your core perks in whatever weapon you have, then mostly Agility (Covert, Gun Fu, Adrenaline) and Luck (lots ..)
---
 - Bloody Mess is one of the best perks in the game. Take it.
---
 - Crit Savvy is better than Better Criticals 3. People have done math. Since you are VATS, I think you may find Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint useful in most encounters. Swap to Tormentor or Richochet for bosses (SBQ, ACP, Encryptid)
---
 - There are a few short-term-boost perks in Endurance (Chems and Revenant mostly) that are broadly applicable; Nerd Rage of course for Bloodied, but you‚Äôre not so don‚Äôt sweat it.
---
 - You have too many cards adding DR / ER ... if you have decent armor the returns on those perks aren‚Äôt as good. The flat damage-avoid cards are better (Dodgy, Blocker, Fireproof). Fireproof 3 lets you ignore explosions and Scorchbeast screams, which is fantastic - and blocker 3 is amazing if you want some defense perks.
---
 - As you level up the legendary STR, etc. slide those points into Agility or maybe base Charisma.
---
 - BTW, never use Legendary Charisma perk if you can help it - your ability to share cards is not affected by your stats given by legendary Charisma.
---
 - I changed your mutations; You don‚Äôt want Talons or the other melee one - they screw w/ your agility and gun accuracy. You aren‚Äôt running Bloodied so you aren‚Äôt stacking like 15 special points on so you can ignore it. 
---
 - I‚Äôm a fan of Herbivore instead of Carnivore, but either one works. With Carnivore you want Scorchbeast meats, canned meat stew and whatever adds to crits in the meat department. If you were an herbivore it‚Äôd be Cranberry Relish (XP), Brain Fungus Soup (INT +5), Gourd Soup (PER+5) and Blight Soup (crit damage). I tend to like herbivore better as the soups also hydrate you.
---
 - I‚Äôm not a fan of Pack Rat; Bandolier can be mighty nice for ammo.
---
 - You may consider getting a few other weapons as time goes by - Railway for one, if you need more oomph and you can‚Äôt sneak (say, you are doing Daily Ops and they kill stealth).  Primed Railway is decent and I bet you can get more ammo back easily in those. Bandolier helps here too.
---
 - I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre using for armor, but in general you want the xxx-slayer pieces mostly - one of each is decent. I keep a full Troubleshooter set for Encryptid, others. 
---
 - Some like deep pockets, I prefer ultralight. Not as good on the carry capacity but I like the APs.
---
 - Another weapon to consider is a Plasma in flamer configuration; it uses Rifleman. You can burn through ammo fast, but it is also a great vamp option (fast firing, uses rifleman, etc.)
---
 - This setup also works perfectly for Commando, just swap those 3 perks.
---

There is a fix, look at your scoreboard before you load in; 
---
if you had searched for a solution before posting you wouldn‚Äôt have to search for a new caps-lock button like you do now!
---
Lmao I love the Roadblock comment üòÇ 
---
Nah yeah I really enjoy the concept of it too, and I want more of it. I hope we get to see some more world building with Steel Dawn.
---
I pray that they won't make this the incoming Brotherhood branch...i dont think they'd do that. Then again a Power Armor skin costs more than a single Fallout 3 DLC....
---
Try going into the scoreboard via the main menu, that should fix it.
---
It's reddit not a fancy dinner dude chill
---
Inside the hotel and directly around it is fairly safe. Look through the suitcases and around the hotel also the trash cans and cupboards. The movie theater definitely has a few cup packs inside.
---
Burrowing in this area does reveal salvage
---
They were really gung-ho about updating our stash back in the early days and then Fallout 1st came along and they just stopped entirely. HMMMMMM.
---
I love how people buy into the sErVeR sTaBiLiTy excuse when Bethesda proved themselves liars with the Scrap Box.
---
THANK YOU! I totally expected Blast Radius at the very least. 
---
It makes no sense
---
Yeah fun again and I'm still trying to get the radiation barrel but nobody really wants to help with the event
---
It doesn't say anything about it in the notes but it wouldn't be the first time Bethesda stealth changed something.
---
I took a floor out to put a different one in in front of my door to my balcony and now it says and it says it intersecting with something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Do you know how to spend those point somehow
---
How did you get 53 spikes? It only gives 13.
---
Yeah, but... it stims if you‚Äôre below 50% health. I don‚Äôt know how OFTEN it does that, but on a bloodied build? You live below 50%, that‚Äôs always stimming you, seems like it would simply burn a crapload of stims.
---
It's interacting with other people. Acting like a baby throwing a tantrum isn't going to make people want to help you. 
---
How old are you? You have the maturity of a pre-teen.
---
As a bloodied build? How many stims does it waste?!
---
That's for sure.  Can you imagine if they made it look like we were getting a ton more xp but in reality it's essentially the same amount
---
Mole rats haunt me at night. their pack nature, swift speed, somehow surviving a .50 to the head abilities.
---
U seem to be the only one throwing a tantrum
---
What A.C.P ?
---
Lowest 116 highest 210. It‚Äôs only good in nuke zones.ü§î
---
I have an idea for improving the trading system and Auction House.    
---
Similar to WoW, there is a central hub. It would be near Morgantown.    
---
You could go here and set an item up for sale. Each character could have 100 slots at one time. You would set your price, qty, and the item would then be in it's own AH server along with the next option. Your item sits for 30 days and you get a notice 3 days prior. If you do not get it within those three days you lose it.    
---
If a person buys it, you get the priced asked minus a fee cost. The important part is this sets the players in control of the market on a wider scale. Since the AH and the next option is on its own server it doesn't matter where you posted or bought said item.    
---
For trading to another character, you would have to know the same of it that you typed/made when you created the character. Simple. Every train station would be a point to send/receive mail. Messages are free. Sending items and caps cost a small fee. Max of 10 items per mail and 100 if junk. Other items like consumables would have a max stack number. As long as you know the name you can send stuff to your alts or mules.    
---
You have to make note as with the AH  if you haven't opened and accepted the contents within 30 days you lost it. Messages can be sent from a new in-game CAMP item: A mailbox. To send stuff, you have to go to a train station point.     
---
IMO, adding this would make creating and advancing an alt have a lot more incentives. Time is what we choose to give up for this game and if BGS are making it more and more of a time sink more people will leave.
---
Same here, did you ever fix it?
---
Get the neon letters plan, then post big "FREE HONG KONG - REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME" signs everywhere. I get dumped into servers with Chinese players as well, and quite often players leave when they see my base and its signage. Maybe it freaks them out or they block me, but the end result is the same. 
---
Also, if they start yelling at you, it's great fun to tell them that Taiwan is number one. They don't like that one at all.
---
Under the conditions I described above, it is possible to pvp players regardless of their pacifist setting.
---
This was not caught in the pts because most players on there liked to play solo (making Taking One useless) and would log off in fear if I found their camp they'd afk at.
---
Tldr; pvp exploit sneaks into the game because pts players want pvp removed from the game and avoid it like the plague
---
A Colossal Problem - The new Wendigo colossus event

Of course it does. You can store all your junk in it.üòÆ

Haha not only are you a child, you're also just dumb.

"I know you are, but what am I?"
---
You know that argument loses efficacy after grade school, right?
---
Oh that
---
Oh nothing at all just people get really toxic with it and id be wanting peaceful gameplay just too have you mess up
---
Have you been the Guinea Pig and tried post patch 22? I didn't read a fix in the notes but we all know Bethesda is absolute shit at accurate patch notes.
---
They completely broke bloodied unarmed didn't they? R.i.p. to my build then. Yikes
---
Never said that but k üëå
---
I wouldn't be surprised. This patch is extremely confusing, but at least I feel like im leveling up way faster...I guess?
---
I want to be able to scrap the extra ammo I get from events and looting though. I‚Äôm tired of it stacking up and transferring it or dropping it every time I‚Äôm over encumbered. 
---
If the UI was simpler it would be easier and quicker to offload unwanted ammmo.
---
Not after that horrible music. üò¨    
---
I'm on PC as well and helped out 3 new players last night. However, I believe all my caps are gone on my main but my 2nd char who is 66 might have more. PM me a message and we'll see what we can do.
---
Thank you man its been a long day and i was in a hurry much appreciatedüòäüôè
---
floater grenade pack
---
~~so you get multiple types~~
---
The problem is by you lose so much dps just from not firing your gun. Grenades are only better if you're fully specced for them with Grenadier and 5* Demolition expert, so you literally do less damage if you use grenades xD.
---
Of course, this is coming from someone with a legacy Gatling Laser, so I'm literally shooting a dozen grenades a second if I break that bad boy out.
---
Still, my point is that for any optimised build, using grenades reduces your dps, which is why the majority of players ignore them.
---
One good use for them are using molotovs to "tag" invisible enemies like assaultrons or cloaked Daily Ops mobs. Aside from that, they are virtually useless.
---
Bloodied players &lt; 100%
---
The bows are great weapons for one thing no matter the prefixes, loot table filler material.
---
Seriously tho they were fun pre patch 22. Now I'm not even gonna try. Those bow cards were some of the first that were scrapped.
---
Makes you almost want to do it again
---
The Mr. Gutsy variations are the best robots in Fallout.    
---
As a Veteran I get the 'talk' and attitude and it's all hilarious.    
---
"Is that someone who needs me to kick their a\*\*!!"
---
I absolutely love mine, tbh. For crowd control, I haven‚Äôt found anything better. Mine did have the MIRV mod on it when it came to me but I stripped that off so now each nuke does 900+ damage.
---
Edit: I also have the grenadier perk card that makes your explosives deal more damage, which amps it up a bit more.
---
Think I'll just take radaway next time

Harness?

I'll have to give it a shot and lyk.
---
If nobody buys from you, it's because you are overpricing, or selling the wrong stuff. Most weapons/armor is just scrip, so sell it cheap, or scrip it yourself. Drugs/alcohol/healing sells fine for 10-20 caps.
---
Plans default prices are ridiculous. If you know the plan, people with higher level than you probably knows it. If you have more than one of the plan, it's probably common. Sell all plans for 50 caps or less. It will sell. You make a low-level happy, and you might even have a plan a high-level has been searching for. If they don't sell, dump them. Especially mounted head plans.

Also canned coffee gives ap boost so you don't tucker out running. Equip can do and hit Whitespring.

Iv had better luck unlocking them separately instead of all at once. Today i unlocked initiate and got the vault 94 jumpsuit and the next time i ran it i unlocked the elder and got the caged bulb light plan. Before i tried it this way i hit elder everytime and only had one other rare plan drop.
---
I‚Äôve only done them solo so far. If I join an Ops team does it automatically bring us all in?
---
Hmmm... I guess that explains why the settler wanderer never uses it...
---
It's definitely not 80%.
---
Can we get the actual dataminer in here to back up their figures? I've asked around in other threads like this, where the '80%' is being questioned, but I still haven't seen the person(s) responsible for gathering this data.
---
You‚Äôre continuing to be a piece of shit to people.
---
This allows them to freely change the end date without issues
---
Yeah I use a lot of guns
---
Yeah that thing is a hell spawn üòÇ and no problem
---
Finally, a post that doesn't complain and gives some facts
---
That‚Äôs the problem, it ends up rarely stimming me and I use a gatling plasma, so I can‚Äôt stim right away
---
20% chance to get nothing and be locked out from rewards until reset.
---
What region are you bud?
---
If they don‚Äôt bring back the 94 raid, they should atleast maybe release a vault 63 raid
---
Word. In the end, F76 to become a metagame, where you game while you game.
---
Yeah, I arrived at a place in the Bog the other day looking for chems for sale.  The turrets were all down, and there were four Super Mutants laying waste to everything in sight.  Like, destroying all the walls, the generator, all the crops, etc. I introduced the Mutants to justice, and went around repairing anything I could see.  I mean, if I‚Äôd been the owner of that (rather cool) C.A.M.P., I‚Äôd have been pretty sad to come home and see his home leveled to the ground like that, and I felt like it was the least I could do.
---
I love finding low level players and dropping stims and plans for them. I didn‚Äôt really meet anyone like that when I started playing, and I want others to have a better experience.
---
Paw Patrol
---
I mean, they're called rare for a reason
---
Same.  I just gained like 2 and a half levels in 6 minutes because of radiation rumble
---
Usa
---
I definitely didn‚Äôt know 1# was possible ! How does that work ?
---
That sucks dude
---
Don't need a full build, get a trusty melee weapon to conserve ammo.
---
Yeah but when the market is flooded with "rare" items that people are getting constantly and I can't even get a single one ya gotta ask yourself is it me?
---
Added (assuming same name as reddit), at your camp rn.
---
This is the way
---
Personally not that fun to me. I just rush the relay, rush everything to get sub 8 mins ASAP. i literally afk booting the things because im wasting fusion cores more than anything
---
I picked settlers and you get some kind of outfit I can‚Äôt remember. It‚Äôs nothing great
---
And thats why I live for this update
---
I don't know why I laughed..
---
Check Raider corpses (both new and old) for frag grenades. The party at Rose's can be a blast. :)
---
Yes but after pre ordering Beth will ship them 8 months late and what you actually get are knock off plushie Pikachu's they bought in bulk and paid the intern to spray paint off white.
---
I get you. A lot of these people are doing it on 4+ characters and waiting until they get something and selling it. Are you level 50 or above? If you're not you won't get rares yet iirc.
---
Bruh its so easy to get 1 kill i just started NW
---
Join discord! Best thing I did for this game! Lots of them for xbox. But I'm sure there is plenty of ps4 groups too.
---
Nah its fine as a game mode and its easy to do every challenges from them
---
I am a mass murderer.
---
Especially with lunchboxes being so easily obtainable, so much XP.
---
Yeah, I've leveled up 41 times since the update dropped.  230 to 271
---
As someone with a programming background, I‚Äôm guessing that scrap box items are much less of a burden. Every piece of steel is going to be the same everywhere, but every gun and piece of armour and food/drink item with a decaying ‚Äúspoil‚Äù rating you have in your inventory is a unique item that can have numerous stats and mods attached to it. That makes it far ‚Äúheavier‚Äù a load than a generic piece of scrap. A player having 1000000 pieces of steel is putting less strain on the server than having one corn soup, because that soup has to exist as it‚Äôs own unique item, while the steel doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs the same as every other piece.
---
On xbox can confirm ran Westek twice today and both times I had multiple gunpowder drops.
---
Im lvl 202 and i had no idea you could fix someone elses base lol will definitely attempt to tho next time now :D
---
What happens if you have a tamed pet at your camp and you move your camp? Does it walk to the new location? Thanks for all the info!
---
I must be the only one who doesn‚Äôt want the spec ops, got two helmets. I just want the solar panels and symptomatic,man.
---
Or 96, there‚Äôs also an unmarked one in the top left of the map
---
I don't have  single build that uses a fat man, but it's fun as hell to shoot one for shits and giggles when i get a couple mini nukes.
---
I haven't leveled up quite as much as I could but I've been thoroughly enjoying just doing whatever I want and still getting enough xp to meet me previous leveling rate. Its made this so much more enjoyable now that I don't feel confined to west tek.
---
&gt; You have exactly 20% chances to get no rewards.
---
The funny thing about this is that if this was any other event, and the other way around, such as Encryptid, and say the Fixer plan dropped at a 20% chance, and 80% nothing. I would fall into that 80% every single time.
---
But in these ops, I'm falling into that 20% every single day.
---
Fuck RNG, I hate it. Give me 100% chance, otherwise I'll not be getting anything.
---
I'm level 110 the rarest thing I have ever gotten is a forest asylum uniform and that's cause I traded a western outfit for it after you could get it from the ski claim thingy
---
You're just unlucky. I've had two consecutive days with no rare drop. Glad I have an alt
---
Okay. I haven't used discord in a few years, but I'll give it a shot again. Do you know any group names recommended?
---
It's disappointing because most of the problems that really made the vault raids work so badly have been dealt with. We have matchmaking in public teams, instancing is working much better, level scaling puts mixed teams on more even footing, they've gotten a better handle on timed missions and they've figured out how to better give rewards that everyone can get without having to tag enemies. I feel like they could have brought them in now and they'd be a lot better received. Doing daily ops in Vault 94 for those of us who did the raids is so overly simplified it's sad. I love daily ops but wish we could have both.
---
Yep, but get class freak. I run marsupial, eagle eyes, bird bones, scaly skin and grounded on my rifleman build. Strange in numbers is good for grouping.
---
It's been longer than two consecutive days for me friend, way longer
---
I think they got rid of the second character on board to free up memory. The board is smooth as glass now, perhaps because it doesn't have to keep calling home to confirm the other guy's location.
---
There is still a season end, however.
---
And what happens when u take card off? All ur overweighted shit gets dumped?
---
Yup and nothing really else to spend the gold on anymore. Shit I still had 6 from season 1. Just so easy to level up and I‚Äôm level 333. Before it would take a good bit of events and enemies to actually level up. Not anymore
---
I died from eating a hotdog today. 15 rads each.
---
Try Pacifist mode, why doncha?
---
‚ÄúMake the game easier and faster!‚Äù
---
Are you on PS4? Because if you are it‚Äôs very unlikely that someone will sell it to you for caps as it is quite rare at the moment.
---
Yes! They will again walk there in real time still but they will move!
---
I just go to an event and spam the Follow Me, 9/10 times, it works.
---
Im really not sure what to say then, you're just unlucky.
---
That last part is so true x)
---
Yeah, I can definitely understand that.
---
Oh dang it's a bug? I just assumed it was those smoke bombs from the robobrains bonking me xD
---
Just responding
---
That‚Äôs cool, I have no issue getting Elder rank with a team. But I have that urge to always perfect solo every timed challenges. So far I only failed the first day (also burrows, but with resilient bots, couldn‚Äôt even make 9 minutes), I wanted to try again today and I seem to came REAL close each time so I was wondering what did I do wrong.
---
Gramps was telling me to hush constantly, so I deleted his chair. Sofia worked right off the bat, so I haven't changed back yet  ... though I dislike Sofia. 
---
No need to move camp.
---
840. Twice as high
---
No
---
Now that you know, you can surprise your friends with weird shit. I leave a flock of flamingos in my buddy's bedroom sometimes, or write messages on the wall of their house like a common vandal.
---
Really any vault lol
---
What system are you on?
---
Definitely useless
---
Friend, I myself am half assed and lazy and I am offended by you lumping me in with the ammo converter. That thing is quarter assed at best.
---
This is the Wasteland damnit! I‚Äôve already got a hockey mask and a machete. Why can‚Äôt I get a good chainsaw?! Halloween is coming. Make the chainsaw awesome!
---
Im on ps4 and already tried it with 20k wanted to buy from someone that mf requested legacy weapons
---
üò¢ which would you recommend for an auto rifle build?
---
I have never felt so justified in using a .50 on that radroach.
---
I‚Äôm on x box! It let me the floor! I‚Äôm trying to find my doorway now tho I had a skin on it I placed from the atomic shop but I‚Äôm in the walls section and it won‚Äôt show that skin for the wall! Just wood
---
Useful for wasting a legendary perk slot.
---
Why do you think I'm providing him with counterfeit equipment rather than going out murdering.
---
Yeah right now it‚Äôs really rare, just wait a bit longer and a few more people may have earned it.
---
This
---
You mean the plan, I suppose, because installs should be fairly cheap. I charge 500 caps per leg.
---
Also consider legendary perks. Funky duds needs a matching set, as does sizzling style.
---
Oh I'm on PS4 :( sorry. Try the fo76 settlements subreddit
---
A very good weapon for those who don't have access to top tier legendries for their build is a fully upgraded flamer tinkered to fix the range bug. With the napalm and compression nozzle combined you have a very high damage aoe weapon that melts all opponents quickly. 
---
The downside is you will need to repair it after each ops, and you need to switch around the barrel mods whenever you are loading into a new sever where you intend to use it otherwise the range gets bugged out, but it will reliably last the entire op when fully repaired and you get back more than enough ammo to replenish any spent.
---
It is probably the best stand alone common weapon with no perks, buffs, or other enhancements aside from it's own upgrades for dealing with the hordes of strong enemies you encounter in these areas, even a level 30 one can do the job quite well.
---
If anyone knows any other good base weapons I would love to hear about them.
---
I'll help you, I got two other who can help too, we are also on ps4
---
You got my upvoteüëç
---
So which one for auto rifle builds?
---
Yes a psychopath outfit needs a chainsaw, how we supposed to do the Halloween event with 3 damage
---
Do pets take rad damage? 90% of my camp is in a high radiation zone. (it keeps me warm at night)
---
Yeah. I see the chickens for sale at foundation and I didn‚Äôt earn it.
---
Do you loot the bodies? Almost every one drops a stim. I've only played these solo and I come away from them with more stims than I went in with.
---
I would think they could but I've never seen it in any of my pets!
---
Uhh can we get them to fix the damn trade glitch first?
---
Same here. Took out one of the things fun about immersion in the world
---
Exactly my point
---
What they need to do I make it so every box holds a certain amount of items so you can kinda organize stuff. Like the foot locker holds 100 pounds and the giant trunk hold 500, that would honestly just be great
---
It's random but procs less often because it also has to proc at night, so if any other events run into the night when the event would normally spawn it will just chose a different event. Same thing with Heart of the Swamp.
---
Yes
---
Are you one shotting everything?
---
This is the best legendary perk for mules
---
The one in the top left of the map is 51 which is the vault that is used for Nuclear Winter so I doubt they will do much of a raid there, Even though they recently made the area around a no-camp zone for future use so it will be interesting to see
---
Haha yea, I find myself shooting blindly into the darkness at times.
---
Don't see any ps4 chats in any of my servers. Try to Google: ps4 fallout 76 discord servers. I'm sure you find a few. Most will have a special ops thread/chat, along with Earle/SBQ runs. Hope you find one that suits you! Good luck!
---
Before the legendary perks: Ew perk cards? Like I care.
---
After the legendary perks: MOTHRFUCKIN' FEED MEEEE.
---
Bahaha no üòê not even close
---
Do you usually sneak?
---
Yeah but were you really so strapped for scrap that you didnt have any to make ammo or so strapped for time you need to do it instantly and that in hindsight is worth the 300+ hrs of grinding you needed to spend worth of lvls/cards...
---
Follow Through is for Stealth Rifles.
---
And caps. We need more cap sinks.
---
Okay just let me know when you are ready
---
Yeah but still rare 1 shots
---
Doesnt that just mean the same thing it has since launch?!? Bethesda creates a problem than pretends to save the day with some new feature or atom shop bullshit.
---
Eat tato salad twice, and you die.
---
Unless they fixed that?
---
Does it continue after you break stealth?
---
My ally does the same thing.  It must have something to do with my location or placement?I don't know.  Other NPCs (traders, etc) have no problem walking in and making themselves at home, so I'm not sure.  I've tried scrapping and replacing it several times.  I've tried moving the items to different locations in the camp.  I've tried different allies.  But they all just stand there.
---
Some days, they're just beside my camp where I can find them easily.  I don't mind that.  And the upside is I don't hear Sofia constantly complaining until I walk over to her.  And then some days, they're far from the camp where I can't find them.  I found her one day a ways down the road.   She startled me when she started talking to me.
---
And then there was that day that she just randomly fast traveled with me to the SBQ event and started fighting the enemies along side of us.  I actually wondered if it was a glitch that only I could see until another player did the confused emote about it.  I took a quick pic with the camera, but I did it so quick that I didn't get a good shot of the SBQ, or I'd share it.  I actually wonder if anyone else has ever had that happen.
---
Now she's back to randomly appearing somewhere near my camp after a week of being nowhere to be found.  Maybe she just found a new guy.  That's cool.  She's his problem now.
---
Edit: Someone mentioned the Future Camp skin.  I did have that on when I rebuilt this camp, so maybe that's the problem.
---
As someone who owns a compound bow I would half agree. I would extend the idea further by proposing that the bow has the capacity to be tuned to pull more pounds. So pulling 100 pounds would require 15 STR and it would do whatever additional damage from being able to pull that much.
---
They'd make it at least 500 per pack...8 coins per card pack would make things far too easy for them. People who got the game post-wastelanders could have 5 maxed perks before even unlocking the 6th slot if you can just get 16 free perk coins every day
---
Thanks for the info! I got a new pet molerat.
---
I would recommend follow through.  It increases damage of subsequent sneak attacks on the same enemy
---
Sorry to poke holes, but one of the common color blind types is a red/green, not red/blue.
---
I think another was like blue/yellow, or something.
---
Just got some off one today
---
Do guns not break stealth?
---
Clearing the Ops has not been a problem, I‚Äôm just throwing them so they get some use but then I always end up with more than I started with through rewards.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iupqbw/psa_this_is_how_daily_ops_rewards_work/)
---
I dont know what taking one for the team is. I imagine its a perk? I thought you meant playstyle
---
Ah a man of culture I see
---
Thats about it.
---
Yeah if you have that camp skin on you‚Äôre CAMP it will glitch it out take that off and replace you‚Äôre camp for caps I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cheating bro üòÇ
---
This would be fine, if it wasn't also a daily *and* weekly quest for the scoreboard. It should be playable for anyone.
---
And the nuke drop would have been the icing on the cake
---
What about your Charisma? The person I play with says my 4 Charisma is too low to tame anything. I have everything else worked out, but they say their 10 Charisma is what allows them to tame stuff like Deathclaws. Is this a thing?
---
Thanks so much for this post regardless!
---
And???
---
Oof this is painfully true
---
This sounds like Raider trickery to me. I've got my eye on you!
---
why is that guys GT the same as ur reddit username
---
I‚Äôd rather have less duped weapons and gear.
---
Here's what the card says:
---
Rank 1 - 
---
Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10% for 30 seconds.
---
Not sure if that time still counts out of sneak because I'm pretty much always in stealth when in combat. But that would be the perk you want for more damage. Otherwise maybe use the Legendary SPECIAL cards to get like Bloody Mess in Luck for example.
---
My first uranium fever post patch, I got a B/e/15r LMG.  Max level, thank you one wasteland!
---
You better believe I'm hitting that event every time from now on.
---
You must not have been around before they introduced vending machines then
---
At least for me, if you start a reload animation, you can cancel it with the stimpack button.
---
In PA, the reload animation doesn't get cancelled, so you can spam stimpacks to heal up.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's what I do when I'm forced to tank in Excavator PA, if I drop low enough, reload and spam the heal button.
---
Three Charisma is ALL you need. Enough to equip Rank 3 of Animal Friend.
---
Have you observed that to be the case?
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah but they added to the lore saying both T-51 and T-60 were in service, with T-60 entering service right after The Battle of Anchorage. They were used to control the population before the bombs fell so if the BoS came across a few it would make sense, since it‚Äôs possible the simply came across it and put it on. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see a combination of both T-51 and T-60 amongst the Brotherhood.
---
The robotics perks should work like animal friend  
---
It would be cool to have a sentry bot at your camp  
---
that is all
---
Usually but idk it it's the gun or me
---
My character is on a strict diet of spoiled meat and inert flux. 
---
The legendary perk didn‚Äôt seek worth it in my opinion. 90% of the time I find alcohol, water or nuka colas while I‚Äôm out exploring and farming junk. So if I run out of inert flux I can always have a drink. 
---
Same with food. With the carnivore mutation I just eat whatever creatures I kill. And if I didn‚Äôt cook it in time I just eat the spoiled meat.
---
Nah. If they ever wanted to give you more stash capacity, the first thing they would have done is to get rid of all the people abusing exploits to store tens/hundreds of thousands of pounds of duped items in theirs to accurately measure server strain. And we saw a few months ago that bethesda has no intent of ever punishing any cheaters. So you're going to have to learn to deal with that 800 since that's not changing any time soon
---
Dude, no. You're being a shitty person.
---
How about this variation on that:
---
# Legendary Quartermaster
---
1. \+50 weight increase to Stash; reduces weight of Junk by 25%
---
2. \+50 weight increase to Stash; reduces weight of Chems &amp; Food by 25%
---
3. \+50 weight increase to Stash; reduces weight of (all) Weapons by 25%
---
4. \+50 weight increase to Stash; reduces weight of (all) Armor &amp; Power Armor pieces/chassis by 25%
---
5. \+100 weight increase to Stash; reduces weight of *everything* by an additional 25%
---
.... reduced weight counts no matter where it is.  Inventory, stash, whatever.  And yes, it's fewer actual points added - but eventually, everything weighs HALF as much, so really, you jump from 800lbs, to the equivalent of 2,200lbs.  :)
---
Those weight reductions would be multiplicative with any from normal perks, so if you have "-60%" from a normal perk, and the full -50% from this perk, the net would be that items weighed 20% of normal, NOT that they weighed -10%, lol...!
---
I disagree man, this would make the event a lot less challenging since we already have the workbenches there. It can be a pain in the ass for sure but hey i like it ngl.
---
I've been playing since B.E.T.A. the introduction of the vending machines causing players stash boxes to be perpetually loaded was actually when I had to stop playing for a while due to the sheer amount of struggling server chug they caused!
---
It really must depend on the conversation choice you make. As I‚Äôm grinding rep I always choose to donate my reward and he never says ‚Äúoh we have 10 more.‚Äù He says ‚Äúoh good, the doc really needed that‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get that intrusion detector installed right away‚Äù.
---
Guaranteed stimpacks, ammo, and legendaries. I love it.
---
Yeah in Australia I struggle to get on during peak US times. Kinda sucks.
---
I can't agree with this.
---
Question. Does a rank 0 allow us to never be dehydrated or hungry?
---
If you have your camp near Charleston, you might be in range of the mini quest.  It‚Äôll trigger every time you enter the area between 6pm and 6am in the game‚Äôs time.
---
The other possibility is you‚Äôre carrying Lode Baring tokens, which have Melody‚Äôs audio message attached by accident.  Drop them and it‚Äôll stop happening.
---
If you invite your friend or random person to a regular team, then yes. You can build at each other‚Äôs camp. 
---
Keep in mind, you can‚Äôt build everything at your friend‚Äôs camp. If it‚Äôs something from the atom shop, you can‚Äôt build it for them. 
---
If you guys are in a public team, regardless which team it is. Then the answer is no. You can‚Äôt.
---
not far at all if you search one wasteland. i was looking for possible updates. anyway your opinion is invalid until you get to mid levels arent arent trying to have a meta build.
---
Sofia gets better if you finish her quest line IMHO. I don‚Äôt mine having her around. She reminds me that I can go get a weapons chest if I listen to her!!!
---
&gt; completely leveled
---
You don't need to level it at all. The base version completely negates the need for food and water, because a new syringe procs into your inventory long before dehydration/starvation occurs.
---
You're supposed to buy them. Bethesda wants money :(
---
Edit: or do character/social/combat/survival/world challenges until those run out
---
Hospital, responders areas, any place with a first aid kit
---
That strikes me as a great idea.
---
Each container a different stash will never happen.  
---
Considering you can build about 15+ containers/stash boxes in your camp, you‚Äôd have a limitless supply. 
---
I do wish they could increase it a little more.
---
I'd equip that as my 6th card on all my characters!
---
Messaged ya. If you shoot me your account name I'll friend invite you and travel to ya.
---
I'm a bloodied melee user and have no problem with the range. Why? Because I find a corner where I'm still in the range of the signal and the range enemies comes to find me and dead they go.
---
I hope we can finally Join a Faction really and have consequences with that. I hate to be the middle Man all the time. I mean you can piss the Raiders/Settlers off how much you want but still can get anything from them, dont lose rep and it just dosent matter what you did to them.
---
Don't forget to equip pharma farmer.
---
Does no one read the subreddit rules anymore?
---
You guys aren't thinking big picture, perk coins packs for ........ATOMS!!! /s
---
I think it would be cool if you could use any of the 3 currencies to buy perk coins. 200 GB, 2k Caps, 150 scrip for a pack of 10. You can buy one pack from each source per 3 days. Or perhaps once per week.
---
That's probably what's going on with mine too.  My camp's too complicated to redo just to switch that out right now, but I'm thinking of a move again sometime soon.  So I guess I'll have to try it then.
---
In almost forgot about the bathroom mirrors sometimes they have medical stuff
---
Apparently it only works with regular stims? That may be old data. Also, I assume there‚Äôs a cool down- I haven‚Äôt seen one listed, but the perk has a 20second cool down and the legendary armor has a 60sec one.
---
You get 2k atoms if you do the entire legendary run. I didn‚Äôt count the scoreboard this run though but it should be the same.
---
Posts like this remind me how much of a filthy casual I am. I‚Äôm fucking impressed.
---
It walks to the new location.
---
I was looking forward to it during the season run. Since then it sat unused at my camp gathering dust and taking up space and budget until i scrapped it recently.
---
Not if you apply a silencer.
---
Its not just Fallout76 although people love sharing it every time here someone does something nice.
---
Any game where resources are required you will find good people helping others in decent amounts. You just hear about the bad first.
---
Ive given away millions of gold in WoW, have different levelling paths ingrained into me because ive spent literal days of play time showing new players exactly where to go, and used to constantly carry randoms through dungeons instead of dipping out when it becomes obvious they probably dont even understand the concept of a rotation. And have spent hours and hours and hours training people not hust the mechanics to raiding but how to behave in raids.
---
You will find good people wherever you look.
---
Try r/falloutmods. Far as I know it works the same as it did in FO4 so someone there should be able to point you in the right direction. You might also be able to find a tutorial on youtube.
---
I‚Äôm a mid-level shotgunner (lvl83). Scorched are your friends for a low-level shotgun build - they drop shotguns you can use in a pinch if yours breaks in the heat of the fight, and also shells - you‚Äôll come out ahead if you can be efficient in your kills or go after them using a melee weapon while you‚Äôre farming ammo. Try going to some of the Forest areas that have lots of Scorched (Morgantown Airport and High School, the trainyard just south of Morgantown Station, Helvetia, Sutton) and light ‚Äòem up! Also seconding the advice to participate in daily ops - use your shotgun and try to tag as many enemies as you can at least once, stay on the uplinks even if you die a bit, and then run around and scoop up shotgun shells from the meatpiles at the end of the event by the bucketloads!
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of being weaker then before but this new balance isn‚Äôt to bad so far me and my friends are far from meta builds and we‚Äôre all able to survive solo well enough
---
The best are reserved for Bloodied, Junkies and Legacies. BE, JE and TSE are a fan favorite coupled with FR and WR. Afterwards, VE, FE and AAE are observed to be great but not as superior as the aforementioned prefixes.
---
Personally, I have a FE90 Flamer and it‚Äôs a blast. Though, I find myself using a VFFR25 Flamer more in daily ops because of survivability.
---
I did elder 6 times, 5 of them on the first try, just one rare plan. That doesn‚Äôt make sense for supposedly having an 80% drop rate for Elder
---
I thought I was imagining things, going through Uranium Fever, seems like the glowing meat drops are 1/5th of what they were before.
---
Nah, i'm with you. This 'one wasteland' is straight garbage. 
---
It's just another way to get you to waste more ammo and resources.
---
Unless your one of those losers who use a lame ass, copy/paste meta-build.
---
Man melee got so gyped this patch.
---
I'm an idiot. Thank you for pointing that out ü§£
---
One animal at a time. If you tame another the other one gets replaced.
---
Ah yes. We love a ‚Äúyour opinion is invalid‚Äù guy
---
Wasn‚Äôt that the indicator of where you had to be to finish by the end? They have several double score weekends, so we are still ahead. The marker will show up once we actually need it. For now? No rush.
---
I run it solo before joining groups and finish before 8 minutes. Easy to do, just so slow on the progression bar lol
---
And more furniture/camp items. There's a lot of us builders out there. Like... The only reason I want to finish this season is to get that greenhouse kit at the end! Must. Finish! 
---
Could you make plates and mugs and silverware place-able like beer steins? That was my fav part of fallout 4...doing complete layouts.
---
Ah I see. Yeah that's unfortunate
---
Need an option to just duct tape a bunch of grenades together so you can just throw a big Cluster F\*ck Grenade...

in other words, ‚Äúmy low level character is not struggling therefore its not difficult for mid level characters‚Äù is a pretty shitty argument. better?

The truth hast been spoken!

LOL thanks and welcome!
---
Legendary perk. If you didn't have it on, you died because your hard drive is slow
---
Shotgun shells for days, bout it. 5 times I've walked into these with 30+ stims and all 5 times I leave with none. I enjoy a challenge, don't get me wrong. But I'm not into sadomasochism and I'm tired of wasting my time and resources on this. Don't mean to be so pessimistic about it, but this is just not fun at all in anyway to me. But that's just my opinion. Clearly most people enjoy it, so more power to you all.
---
Are you sure it needs to be half level of yourself? Because I tamed a 64 mega sloth, it was equal my level and I could still tame it, it also happened to another mega sloth he was level 66  and it was equal to my level at that time. Hmm maybe they changed it
---
That's how premium currency is supposed to work.   
---
If you get everything on the atomic shop for free, the game makes no money and dies.
---
Was this pre patch 22 or after?
---
It doesn't help that im bloodied so it literally takes 2 seconds in a nuke zone to die
---
I believe it's only the osmosis kit that they have plenty of, even though he tells you that it's the last functioning one when he first sends you to get it.
---
My game is still going past 60, double check your custom ini still has iPresentInterval=0
---
It‚Äôs the same. 2000 Atoms over a ten week period.  
---
The good old days of getting about 500-700 a week are gone.
---
I want to ditch mine but I've got 1ks of rounds in .38/10mm to convert into usable ammo
---
I usually just let them keep it, finish the quest right then instead of having to go back to foundation, but surprisingly he hasn't said that to me in a while, it's usually  we haven't needed to use it..
---
It‚Äôs this patch we have now.
---
I just ate two in a row. Didn‚Äôt die.
---
Yeah this update has really screwed over any player lower than 120!
---
Then I wonder if they made a change! I'll have to do some research because this would be an awesome change! Thank you!!
---
You aren't wrong, but then we will complain it should be 2000
---
They are fun, even if they sh\_t all over players that like to stealth..
---
I cant keep more than 1500 because I‚Äôm constantly making bullets.  Lol.
---
I had 32k steel last time i checked and 17k lead. Im unarmed but still collect and scrap everything i see.
---
There are 2000 in the season (about 200/wk) plus all the world challenges, combat challenges, etc
---
No problem!
---
Lol, I cant disagree with that. Have a friend for your collectron.
---
I probably have 60k and I am not even trying to collect it üò¨
---
Others have mentioned it, but there's a short cut to leave terminals.  On PC it's escape.  On console it's holding down the back button.
---
Just like your camp does, yes.
---
Yes - since you're level 50 now, you should use your scrip points.
---
Personally, if on my first character, I would roll 2 stars to get more rolls. 
---
As soon as you get a weapon you like, switch to 3*. The resale and scrip return value is far better on 3*
---
The excavator PA is great. Made better with calibrated shocks, which gives *another* +100 to carry weight!
---
What platform you on?
---
Right now 11k
---
I did have 29k a month or two ago before i started filling my vendors with ammo, turns out ammo sells very well.
---
Good luck!
---
Alas that's the state of the game with every enemy since the update..
---
i prioritize combat perks and my mid level toon is still struggling. i specialize in two weapon types. i guess i made the mistake of thinking i could get some perks for both 1h and 2h melee as well as commando. guess im a filthy casual.
---
If I take a lv.50 Wolf in the Forest, because they cap at 50 in the Forest, but I'm lv.200 and camping in the Cranberry Bog, do you think their level would increase after they have arrived at my camp and I do a server hop?
---
Also all weapon mods as well I believe.
---
Just north of 40k.
---
I would roll two star weapons to stretch out your scrip. You can try and buy or trade for gear depending on your caps. You can get a free set of Ultracite PA once you finish the Brotherhood of Steel quest line.
---
what levels are you guys?
---
I don‚Äôt have fallout first and I usually have 300 to 400 steel.
---
Even though I craft ammo a lot to sell, I currently have about 17k in my Scrap Box on my main. Probably about 3-5k on each of my alts. 
---
I currently have one extra point of Intelligence I‚Äôm not really using for anything so I keep Scrapper slotted in. And after a Uranium Fever run, for example, I have a lot of Steel available. It adds up fast when you‚Äôre not using it.
---
It‚Äôs just yet another horde mission.
---
"I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cheating bro"
---
I'm sure she's able to find a raider who's hard up enough to put up with her for a couple of hours.  üòÇ
---
That one thing I hate is the burrows because I keep getting lost trying to get from point to point, I can‚Äôt be the only one right?
---
I hope my memory is not playing tricks on me again, I will try to tame another pet tomorrow and see if it‚Äôs equal to my level before taming.
---
I dunno why you got downvoted but you're not wrong. Trying to look at it from the developer side knowing it's a camp item that does this specific thing, and knowing the limitations of the terminal system...
---
Might see if I can make a better version in fo4 for shits and giggles to understand what it would take.
---
Oh my lord üòÇ she for the wasteland w
---
No, you and those who just want free atoms are lame.
---
Remember atoms are not included in the base game, free atoms is a gift, not something to be expected.
---
I'd pick it as #2 (second only to the Infiltrator one), myself.
---
Animals you cant tame with Animal Friend, you can tame with Wasteland Whisperer. I tamed a snallygaster, and a rad scorpion with it. They both died very quickly though. You can also use it to pacify Super Mutants. I'm currently looking for a single spawn Super Mutant, to try and tame, I will report my finding. Everything I have been able to Pacify with Animal Friend, I have been able to tame. So I'm investigating this with Wasteland Whisperer.
---
There's a terminal shortly after entering the cave, to the right is a control panel, you can interact with that.
---
Ok, cool i spam 2's till i get something i like. And yeah im on the brotherhood part of the questline. Sweet.
---
Mine leveled to 50 and held there. It may!
---
Is the cave below the vault door?
---
Burrowin in this area does reveal salvage
---
Should give us a high level version. Or at least let me display it in camp on a heavy weapon display.
---
It took me over 60 kills of Earle to get any of those frigging plans!
---
I'd love to see what you find out!
---
Edited: maybe the base damage is not showing decimals?
---
20 hour resets have me always wondering what time I can turn in notes, scrip weapons, and sell items for caps. It's so annoying not actually knowing without taking literal notes every time I exchange stuff on a given day/night.
---
Dude at least he has an okay voice, she sounds like a mississippi trash can mixed with pizza bites
---
500 per pack would be totally fine too. It would give me an added incentive to give a crap about treasury note grinding
---
No you have to enter a cave before you even see the vault door, you'll see the vault door ahead of you when in front of the panel.
---
87k on my main character, 10k each on the other 4 on that account.
---
Oh I may not be going to the right area. Thanks for the heads up!
---
It seems like completing lode barring is a curse
---
I of course do not speak for everyone, but I would have no problem with a &lt;50 tagging along for an ops and hanging out on the beacon.
---
the third one was confirmed to be a Brotherhood of Steel themed one.
---
So they reappear also?
---
I have 40k. not trying to collect. and I run commando. 
---
cant remember last time I made bullets. 
---
at 250k 556 and 250k .45 right now.
---
Yep when you log back in!
---
I'm usually on my phone or Switch while I wait for the lobby to load in yeah.
---
Your build is fine, just raise your health a bit. If I am struggling I raise my health to about 40%. Remember you don‚Äôt have to kill the mobs for the uplink to progress. You surviving should be your no. 1 priority, not necessarily DPS. There‚Äôs no reason not to run this in a team so let them soak up as much damage as possible while you crit heads.
---
Take it slow and find an area where you are shielded on at least one side. If you can‚Äôt find one try to be back to back with a teammate. Hunker down and let gun fu do the work for you. Just hold the fire and crit button until everything is dead. As soon as an uplink finishes move out of the area. You don‚Äôt need to kill the remaining mobs to start the next objective. This will funnel them in behind you and make it easier to finish them later.
---
Ironically scored a lvl 100 Diseased/glowing Deathclaw 1st try by forward station alpha...now I‚Äôm greedy and hopping for a chameleon üòá...thx again üëçüèª
---
(When I hopped servers he turned into a lvl 50 diseased DC...kinda odd)
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point lol.
---
The hit register is really annoying, even with guns I get the same problem. It's not like the health bounced back, the registered hit sometimes deal delayed damage or just don't at all.
---
Yo, we heard you like to game so we put a game in your game so you can game while you game!
---
-Brickhouse (probably)
---
No worries, i'll take a screenshot of what you should be seeing to open the door.
---
have it, super fun past the first level.
---
I do it once in a while, and always toss the tokens immediately.  They weight 0.1 each, so I‚Äôm not going to let them accumulate.  I also don‚Äôt want ore rewards that I‚Äôll never smelt to add even more weight.
---
WOW! That‚Äôs crazy! I definitely feel like I need to grind then lol xD
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Ok, cool you confirmed my idea on how to spend my scrip. Cool.
---
Well with the excavator, the carry weight is good for freeroam long hauls, but i'm looking for short term stuff. Like fighting the big wendigo or SBQ or daily ops. I think the excavator has bad damage resist stats?
---
Im on PS4
---
you know players sell this in there vendors . I would recommend if you are buying alot to be friend a seller
---
Oh word no way that would be super helpful. I tried googling it and watching YouTube videos but it was all pre patch 22 Vault 94. Thanks man!
---
I hear you, and I agree with much of what you‚Äôve said. Count me as someone who feels your pain. As a developer I‚Äôm scratching my head at the design practices deployed by Bethesda. I was enjoying my time playing this game for months despite the shockingly bad bugs. I had a few capable characters, who are now utterly useless. VATs is hilariously broken, but now with the huge difficulty ramp up, it is unforgivable while charging money.
---
Oh nice! Going to have to get myself a megaslouth now. It‚Äôd be nice if you could put them in a secure room but I guess it‚Äôs whatever
---
PC. LITS during season 1 was easy to walk away with 3k steel each run with scrapper by just breaking down everything across my main and my charisma mule that I had sitting there.
---
Looks like someone is mad, to sit here and downvote everything, lol.
---
I'd love to see that
---
You guys are blowing my mind lol. I used to think I had a lot! Guess not xD
---
The health bit was kind of the logic going with some Legendary Endurance &amp; Life Giver, just so I could raise that bottom 20% up a bit. I haven't tried it since I made that move however.
---
Good to know though, I was worried I had severely bodged something. Was maybe thinking of picking up Ricochet but it doesn't seem to be recommended as often as Blocker &amp; Dodgy.
---
Wouldn't mind a B-FFR something or other HM/Fixer, but not sure I'm ready to go down that wormhole.
---
Got mine from starting the Possum scout quest. Didn't know you could get it any other way.
---
I think I sold a weapon a loooooong time ago for like 60k.
---
That‚Äôs nuts!! Do you use it for anything? XD
---
He‚Äôs also told me the bone saw hasn‚Äôt been used yet but they‚Äôre glad to have it back. It appears when you donate he‚Äôs very happy to have valuable equipment returned.
---
What rifle is it?
---
I mean if you enjoy it then great. But I just can't stand it.
---
But they need to dial back the robot spawn rate
---
[Here ya go](https://i.imgur.com/dBXHTF4.jpg)
---
Should be able to just interact with the yellow console, if not maybe check the terminal first (it's been a while for me so my memory may be off)
---
Same. And the fact that vendor bots, scrip machine, and gold bullion all have different resets depending on when you use them its crazy. At the very least they could all just tie together.
---
Thank you!!!!!
---
They are wonderful!
---
It's based on the weapons base damage. If you remove weapon mods that increase damage it will line up.
---
Yeah, gotta love the glitches!
---
Not really lol just for repairs every now and then. I love looting, I can't not pick up everything i see so it adds up pretty quickly. I sell steel on occasion, when I'm low on caps so it does come in handy for that
---
Amazing job! I don't think I'll ever bother building something that complex but this vid is really helpful!
---
For some reason I never did One Violent Night, and once I did, I fell in love with it.  So cool.
---
üëç
---
Im just naturally good into any pvp shooter games. I just do it sometimes to past the time when adventure gets boring. Its also free rewards and xp
---
Can you imagine getting missiles as a quest reward and trying to drop them only for them to be auto looted back in your inventory. It will just become a vicious cycle.
---
Preston Garvey clone
---
The taming with animal whisper finally worked for me. The first lone encounter I got was a level 5 chicken though. I have serious doubts that Mr. Cluckers will make it to my camp.
---
Exactly. I go to Foundation and turn in notes. Go to Sunny to get caps and he hasn't reset yet. Go to train station to get scrip, not ready yet. Or whichever happens to not be ready on any given play session. Last night nothing was ready until nearly midnight. It's really annoying.
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod that mutes damn Melody Larkin for good.
---
Oh the days when that lil chicken could spawn as Legendary....
---
You can always experiment with those perks, but I find spawns don‚Äôt come fast enough to warrant them once you get set up in the uplink rooms. You should be able to kills the mobs as they spawn even if you have to increase your health a little. IMO crit is the meta right now. As long as you have the crit perks you should be fine. Spray and pray.
---
&gt;The funny thing is, the Season Rewards were one thing PTS players weren't allowed to touch.
---
What's even the point of a PTS if you can't even test shit?
---
There is no good loot anywhere. It's ether low level tinker bench plans and .38 or its spoiled food.
---
And they need to just execute Mad Dog Malone. 
---
I slay how many supermutants?  But he gets captured?
---
It could just say.....
---
PiffMaestro420 (in event)
---
JeffDaSnack69 (at camp)
---
That would be enough for me.  I can open the map to see where they are.  If they‚Äôre at an interesting event like Project Paradise or Encryptid, I‚Äôll jump over and join them.
---
Ther seasons are designed to reduce players income of free atoms so you HAVE to spend real world money if you want to buy atom store items. 
---
Sounds like it's working as intended.
---
Ya it‚Äôs a shame that we get less but to tell you the truth I‚Äôm making more atoms now then I did before because I got tired of doing them. ( especially the ones that I need to take a picture of someone in a mistress outfit in a nuke zone...ya I still remember that one )
---
At least now feels more rewarding since we get a lot of stuff that we probably would not buy to begin with since they would have been 500+ to buy each. On the plus side as well the dailies and weeklies are much faster and easier to complete then before.
---
Thanks
---
If you look up Angry Turtle's videos, he did a series of tests and basically all PA sets are more or less equal in practical damage resistances, even though numbers suggest otherwise.
---
What you are missing out on the most with Excavator is the ability to equip a Jetpack. Excavators can't do that while the other variants can.
---
I'm on PS as well, if you want to drop your PSN I'm happy to make a jetpack PA for you or hook you up with some gear when I'm home later.
---
Can you really not trade with a vendor when someone else is there? I was wondering why I couldn't access one the other day while someone else was standing there. That's ridiculous, lol.
---
Any opinions on this?
---
This. If you have a hardened receiver, you are seeing "extra" damage which is not applied to the perk.
---
Like when you craft ammo and super duper triggers, but you receive only double the base amount (and ammosmith is ignored).
---
I feel that. I‚Äôm a hoarder so it was hard when I didn‚Äôt have 1st lol. I‚Äôm gonna be hurting when I don‚Äôt have it anymore xD
---
I have a little over 57k. Most came from trades but I always run uranium fever for the chance at rare rewards and junk you can gather.
---
800 is more than enough, manage your inventory. Dont keep trash weapons or trash armour, only keep rare plans, throw the rest away or give them all to some level 5 dude,  shit types of ammo, throw it away or recycle it. 
---
Im floating around 600/800 now.  The only thing they need to do is separate vendor items from stash and display items from stash.
---
In the current ops, stealth doesn't work, so what I do is drop my stealth perks for others. I usually only have 1* adrenaline, but I have it ranked to 3* to use in Ops. I would also suggest evasive in agility for extra damage resist. Otherwise, your build is similar to mine. I have even started using power armor, which I never use, if the op is tough.
---
Like the other commenter said, raise your health to a point where you can survive longer, maybe even keep your eyes open for a Vampires weapon.
---
Looks like I‚Äôm gonna have to run that more often haha.
---
Or just add it as a reward for leveling up and opening perk packs
---
Too bad you aren't on PC. I have an ultracite set that is modded out I've been trying to give away. Good luck with your rolls. I would hit events to try and get legendary drops. One Wasteland makes it easier to get gear now.
---
Canadians
---
I was considering some PA action, been awhile, have some base perks for it in the wings and a set of I think T-51b with a Rider skin that has been lonely in the stash. 
---
Pretty high in DR, 377 atm and I was under the impression breaking 400 it has diminishing returns? 
---
Vampires is on the list for sure, may have one on the mule I'll need to check to be sure though.
---
The only "!" Events I do are the ones that 100% award legendary drops. Uranium fever, radiation rumble, one violent night and leader of the pack. Maybe line in the sand but only if I havnt maxed out my daily script. Enemies drop weapons so there's free steel
---
Welcome!
---
Let's not.
---
&gt; They are genocidal blood thirsty maniacs and not worthy of our time
---
Oh so the BoS in general?
---
Yeah I'm not even used to using them, well pre-P22, as the stealth/bloodied factor I rarely ever got hit : / 
---
Standard mobs still not much of an issue, besides using 2-3x the ammo I'm used to, but still feels like a strong build overall. Ricochet is just kind of tempting to return some back their way but I reckon holding my Luck setup as is could be fine.
---
Water just came out of my nose
---
*settler ops* ‚ÄúWE NEED YOU TO DO THIS VERRY IMPORTANT TASK FOR US‚Äù ‚ÄúWE NEED YOU TO GO BEYOND THE WALLS, OUTSIDE WHERE THE FENCE IS AND PLANT A FEW CROPS AND COLLECT THE READIED ONES‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúTHIS IS A VERRY IMPORTANT TASK THAT NOT ANYONE IS ASKED TO DO, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE ‚Äú
---
Na. Go to the mire and fight disease animals and or run around the water; eat raw meat and drink dirty water.. I‚Äôm sure u‚Äôll eventually get it there
---
Well, you can get perk coins faster using lunchboxes, so it already kinda works this way.
---
They come in a package deal.  I think I've gotten it two or three times.
---
I think people attack a *bit* more than they trade
---
Ya I never got it because it‚Äôs like a drug. Once you feel that inf storage you‚Äôll never want to go back.
---
I keep telling myself that 100 to 150 of each junk is good enough
---
With three inactive characters that I use as mules and extra scrip characters for Purveyor sales, I never throw away legendaries.  I‚Äôll transfer excess from my main when the stash hits 700, and just start scripping the heaviest stuff first.  If they go way overweight and can only walk, I don‚Äôt care.  Scripping 750 a day every day burns through a lot of junk, no matter how much I farm.
---
Caps and bullion are another story.  I haven‚Äôt had a vending machine since last December because I have to server hop for .45 and .50 in order to get rid of enough caps.  I‚Äôve been buying useful magazines and bobble heads just to burn in the Daily Ops, too.  I haven‚Äôt turned in any treasury notes in at least a month.
---
I‚Äôll probably spend as many caps on miner pails as I can, just to give myself a few weeks of not needing to buy useless stuff from other players.
---
Yup I always read about it but never thought it‚Äôd happen to me, I was very surprised
---
I appreciate your sacrifice!
---
I don't have 1st, and I don't need steel for the ammo I make, so essentially none at all.
---
Is it near the crashed airplane?
---
For the most part, yeah you don't get the bang for your buck over about 400 dr, but it does still help even if just a little. It's not entirely wasted.
---
The only things I do for power armor are power user since VATS kills cores and traveling pharmacy since I lose my chemists backpack. T51 will do just fine and no evasive needed if in power armor.
---
Tell me more of this immortal god perk combo?  I haven‚Äôt been able to make up my mind when it comes to legendary perks.
---
First step for Recruitment Blues is try to register in the Bos Terminal of the 3rd floor at Fort Defiance.
---
We've pretty much gotten everything there is to get from it.
---
like literally just snap double pics, +10 intelligence my ass- these vault dwellers were not the brightest
---
I only have a single small generator to power a vending machine and make my camp visible on the map. 
---
You people drinking electricity or what?
---
Sounds good, TY üëç
---
Like Swarm of Suitors used to be silly easy to solo.  Like Leader of the Pack easy.  After the rebalance I haven‚Äôt done it again, but I can imagine it‚Äôs not quite so easy.
---
Maybe because it's a bow? I mean hell, they dont even give the fatman or missle launcher love and they've been around forever.
---
I did the event like 3 times, got all the rewards. It‚Äôs just a waste of time honestly. Shit ton of ammo, buggy af. The queen is a much better event
---
Or some really cool ones. I have a few that make it look like my gunslinger is burning a room full of Scorched and mopping up the leftovers, or holding a terrified one at gunpoint.
---
My glitches tend to be more along the lines of invisible Yaoguai
---
Yes. This has been happening to me lately. When I try to inspect, it freezes up. After it loads, it's all good. After that, it won't freeze up when I inspect another one. Same thing when buying from the Purveyor; first weapon freezes up and then I'll be able to spam buy with no issue.
---
FT to Big B's Rest Stop (Just south of Harper's Ferry). Head west on the road, go under the railroad bridge and then hang a left where the water crosses the road. Follow the water west and you see the Quonset hut you're looking for. Lots of ticks spawn there.
---
I been camp hopping all day looking for dang sympto-matic plans to no avail
---
These are such great ideas for both factions.
---
For daily ops swap out your escape artists and other stealth perks and swap in a rank of born survivor. If it procs at 20% and your ideal is 40% it will save you a few times.
---
What happens if you equip rifleman 1? Just a thought, but maybe it counts rifleman 3 as three separate additive perks.
---
This seemed to do the trick. Runs like butter. Thanks boss!
---
I mean yes and no lol ü§£
---
Perhaps is time to bring back my Instigating Super Sledge from retirement for use with PA :-)
---
76 uses cloud based web servers. Amazon Web Services has one based in Sydney which I assume covers Aus and NZ. Next closest is Singapore.
---
If you join off main menu and not your social menu you should get a reliable server to play on. All dependent on the local traffic in your area and how good your connection is.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs worst since the patch .... ahhh
---
I just try not to think about all the photos of Meg I have given him and why he is so willing to keep getting more.
---
Once someone has all the rewards and 10754 screws, what's the point?
---
Only place I can think of is [this place](https://i.imgur.com/eQTBhua.jpg)
---
Which is [where my character marker is](https://i.imgur.com/Yz4UtlG.jpg)
---
chainsaw,ripper,buzzsaw are all worthless/useless.
---
Just keep.buying serums
---
Fuck, yes. I have a junk box and my damn stash is full. I don‚Äôt even understand, I keep so little. I just want a little more space,man.
---
Damnit I want the war glaive even more now .
---
In all seriousness its pretty decent to look at.
---
Maybe they finally got over mascot heads and ghillie skins to start making some decent looking clothes.
---
Well equipped trained personnel can recover
---
I‚Äôm with you, OP. I have a gross amount of EVERYTHING except for steel. I was starting to wonder if I was crazy...it‚Äôs like the one thing that is always gone no matter what I do.
---
What do people do with the rewards? I scripted mine. They seem lackluster
---
I'm sure someone said it already but make sure he is in pacifist mode and to not take a workstation that is owned by another player
---
I hope we go back to SBQ fights. Just finished the second one on the server I was on. 20 of us running around, chasing her because her flight path was wonky, slaughtering all of her minions... it was so much damn fun. Leveled up twice from all the events being ran tonight.
---
I don't mind paying a visit to Earle once in a while to say hi but I'd rather the repair kits from Queenie than lose a crap load of ammo now.
---
My guess is that because it's a behavior not currently present with terminals. There could be concern that the introduction of a new pattern would confuse customers or that it's an engineering effort not worth the gain (and potential for new bugs or/or exploitative behavior).
---
The slider with which most people are familiar loads in a dialog box. Aside from inserting a holotape, dialog boxes don't appear for terminals. At least, from what I can recall. I tried to search the interwebs to confirm, but frequent interchangeable spellings of dialogue and dialog led to no success. And a headache.
---
You gotta have 16 base strength in order to beable to use it /s
---
Well most of the world challenges are ridiculous and reward 20, 40 at much 80 atoms. :(
---
Collect 7600 wood, play 7600 hours, build 7600 items, repair a lot of weapons.
---
I got a bloodied buzzsaw it‚Äôs not that bad with one wastelanders but rippers and chainsaws don‚Äôt drop legendary and have terrible damage
---
They reset every day at 8:00pm est for me. You have to go to them to trigger them and the raider one switches between Rocksy and Wren, so check her too. The settlers are always Ward though.
---
I think i might know the shack youre thinking of, Its south west of harpers ferry, And if you go directly west of Big B's Rest stop youll find it along the north side of the stream.
---
You here to cause maximum damage, or crack a laugh occasionally? It'll really depends on your gameplay and playstyle. I've put 2 levels into FFF and to be honest it's increased my enjoyment of the game, especially when it goes off in mobs, but that's mainly because I'm more a casual player rather than maximizing everything to cause ultimate damage.
---
I can't believe how little is available.   I want to turn on my machines so badly but this stupid caps issue forces them to be off.
---
Oh jesus...that's amazing luck...but ur right...nothing but shit from now on
---
I'd like to know what the "spin" side of it does, the wiki says it will dispense new ammo, but all I see it do is the animation, I get no notification that I've gotten any kind of ammo payout. Is it just for decoration? Or did they intend to do something with it that never got finished?
---
As for the terminal part, yeah it's intentionally obtuse to use to make you waste time and get frustrated and buy supply creates or something. It was made that way not because they are lazy or stupid, it was made that way for the exact reason to be frustrating, it's for the bottom line, plain and simple.
---
I meant the plans. I didn't get anything remarkable from the event as far as weapon/armor. I have bought a ton of cursed weapons to use for scrip on my alts.
---
That was the most annoying quest event I ever tried.  Assloads of mole rats in the middle of bombed out Charleston, all the while Scorched are roaming the streets and Super Mutants looking down from the buildings.  Wave after wave after wave.  For like 25 caps and a diluted Stimpack.
---
write me an essay
---
If I recall the bug was that a player buys out your whole store inventory and that is what causes the stash to appear. Which is why everyone usually has a random note or item in their store worth 30k caps.   
---
Also couldn't find proof of this, but I'm willing to lose a store slot to be safe than sorry.
---
Man I hope so. I don‚Äôt think I can handle another furry running around mad they can‚Äôt kill super mutants with a wiffle ball bat. Leave gta in gta.
---
It's about reducing micromanagement. I have one point of it, because my character is a scavenger and likes to hack/lockpick his way into things. 
---
The perk is good not because of allowing you to skip the "task of doing the thing" but because you can forget about hacker and lockpick perks.
---
I wouldn't touch that one at all, yeah.
---
I hear we can cripple her wings again. This true?
---
I was doing uranium fever every time it popped up until low level (50-90ish) players started showing up and just dropping legendaries before anyone could get a hit on it. Like yeah, I get it, you‚Äôve completed your build and recently got your high damage weapon to complement that build. Doesn‚Äôt mean you need to kill everything with that weapon, especially at an event with legendaries. 
---
Also, I‚Äôve got so many god damn legendaries in my stash just waiting to be scripped that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to roll the dice on potentially having considerate players show up to it to get some more 1 and 2 star legendary armor. On a private world I‚Äôll do it though.
---
Rip im trying to go for a aid reduction solar armour. Sofar scrapped like 5 arms already
---
Maybe if I got more than shovels, harpoon guns and screws.
---
67k of organic steel
---
I think I know what place you're talking about. It's a run down house with a bunker next to it right?
---
Thanks!
---
It would be neat for some cross overs but we don‚Äôt need more people complaining how this is not their version of ‚Äúfallout‚Äù
---
There were quite a bit of people like that when some of the legendary run rewards were shown last season.
---
I would be fine as long as it‚Äôs not too in your face such as people running around in full plate mail, glowing gear, and what not.
---
Ah, apologies. I forgot üòï
---
Pretty much everyone that was active during the cleaver dupe is stocked up with thousands of steel. It was even used as currency before that, but then again so was 5.56...
---
Equipable Wedding rings are in the game! Since he is your fianc√© I assume you two are into that.

---
This doesnt account for rifles though. My go to was a pair of legendary lever actions. Nonexplosive but the slow fire rate still did no damage so ive switched to a 50 cal machine gun and always burst fired them anyways as there is that slight delay. It may have gotten bigger but no its not 2 seconds lol.
---
Do you use Speed Demon? That helps close the range, and I'd like to think enemies piss themselves when they see me running full speed at them with a Grognak's Axe.
---
I timed it.  It takes 15 seconds for me to switch 3 perks and switch them back.
---
I honestly am not sure. She landed plenty in the battles I saw before patch 22.
---
.-.
---
 will bethesda ever S T O P with these mfs? 
---
Do you have a link?
---
Everyone's got the unique rewards, he's more bullet spongy than the Queen (and she drops more flux), and unlike the queen you're not waiting around in a cave for 5 minutes before the fight can even start - queen fights are often started and finished in that time.
---
EDIT: And repair kits, i'm 90% sure earlie doesn't drop them, queen does.
---
Yup. It's a shame too. Back in the days when over-repairing them drastically increased their damage they were fun as hell.
---
The drops are garbage and the nerf makes it more difficult dumping more ammo. üòÉ still fun tho. Solo much funner.
---
This was an interview back before the legendary run went live. I don't have it on hand alas.
---
Feel like this is the only acceptable reason to Nuke their CAMP
---
Happy for you two :)
---
You can still get a 1 star ripper as a random reward from the candy exchange machine in Watoga HS. Anything with more than 1 star is a very expensive legacy at this point.
---
Grenadier doesn't affect explosive weapons like grenade launchers and such? Didnt know this.
---
Near the dears on the map there‚Äôs three train car bunker under a power line tower. Just east of that is a destroyed home, and not destroyed but ramshackle bunker. You can pretty easily build onto the second bunker. The first you have to use stairs to put a second story floor over the bunker,or build up into the tower.
---
Asking the real questions. Also what is Ward doing with all those photos of Meg anyway?
---
It takes me three seconds to walk to the TV and turn it off but you can bet your ass I am going to use the remote control to do it. 
---
That's how it works.
---
I just want PA displays that don't take up stash space so I can show off my collection and not have to give up 10 weight units per set
---
Well you may not remember the good ole days but there was a glitch that allowed infinite stash it had no impact on the servers, me and my buddies would see no load time difference or server difference even if all 9 of us who had camps clustered together loaded in with over 1 million in stash weight.   
---
The reason there is a weight limit is the individual ID of each item, but a stash full of junk and aid you see no difference now when you have 1000+ guns then, then there is load lag but it never seemed to interfere with the servers.   
---
Basically it is is an arbitrary limit they themselves put on to keep people from massively hoarding.   
---
So knowing that what would happen if you take the card off you go back to base 800 and your stash is overweight until you bring it back down or re-equip the card.
---
I wish it was broken lol. But, welcome to the world or worse RNG üôÉ
---
it's pretty fun. good challenge, and it helps to have 3 people to keep the jerks from going in the water
---
Not bad but I think it is a little to generous.
---
My low level character is not struggling, my mid level character is not struggling, and my high level character is not struggling. That better?
---
2500+ hours and not one of those drops yet üòí
---
Yes, but you having a tv remote doesn't mean you lose your refrigerator.  In fo76, it's all about opportunity cost.
---
That's terrible.
---
Is there a place that seems to spawn more mega sloths than anything else? They‚Äôre so cute...
---
I find that once it is obvious that I am collecting ore, at least one other person begins to help.
---
Glad it‚Äôs not just me that seems to stub my toe 24/7
---
Do we know for sure how long the season will be?  How long was the last one?
---
My comedy sawed off shotgun that I have to get into actual melee range to use is great in daily ops still.
---
Brilliant tool, and that wonderful formatting makes me believe one day we'll get Skyrim ported to Google Spreadsheets
---
Found a mr. Handy buzz blade with unstoppable monster aspects. Did 1/4 the damage as UA back when you could get UA. Only benefit is u can just hold the attack button and go from mob to mob but it takes too long to kill
---
Thanks for clarifying that lol üòÇüò≠
---
Cannot wait for the Greenhouse Walls and Roof. Big ass windows is what our CAMPS were missing.
---
If you use explosive weapons or a tesla ALL the intent behind pacifist becomes in actuality... absolute garbage.
---
Morgantown airport. Put on pharma farma. There‚Äôs tons of aid boxes there.
---
TAKE DOWN THAT HEART
---
The fancy pump legit just feels satisfying to use, and that fast reload with 12 shells is just *chef's kiss* I barely use my gauss shotties anymore cuz they don't feel as good.
---
The 12000 points I just lost  accidentally buying max 45 ammo instead of selling the min amount maxes me agree with you.
---
I've definitely been really lucky in this game.
---
Lol
---
Nice try Bethesda....I'm not gonna tell u
---
Swamp itch comes from sleeping on mattresses, I believe. While you can increase the likelihood of infection by failing to eat/drink and using RadAway, the other behavior that you've described may not help in getting this particular disease.
---
Get rid of junk notes and holotapes you never use. Each item in your stash and inventory makes it go slower.
---
Try it with your friends. Shoot a tesla, and tell me you dont get what I'm explaining to you... Its completely garbage if people can still kill you when your tesla arcs to another player.
---
Tested this today with every player I've come across so... it's a thing.
---
I would like it if they were diametrically opposed.
---
I heard their working on a mission other then uplink that favors stealth due to lesser enemies but their much harder to take down.
---
But that‚Äôs a rumor I recently heard so idk if it‚Äôs true or not.
---
Correct!
---
Holy shit this is definitely gonna help me I literally dont know why I didnt think that
---
It's all about that SWWWWARRRMIN' VERMIN
---
I still think Blue Ridge Caravan needs extended Free Range-ish runs, and instanced caravan runs through hostile areas on the edge of the map. Like past the Ohio River or out in the hills past the Bog.
---
Truth!!  Best love/hate event there is!!
---
Nah stealth still works dude- it just doesn't cut people down and for Daily Ops right now it's not a thing. 
---
I swap to Commando for Daily Ops but still run stealth in overland. Yeah I lost some firepower but who didn't. Do some tinkering and I'm sure you'll keep enjoying it if that's what you want to stay as.
---
I play about two to two and half hours a day normally. I am by far not hardcore, I just go for efficiency for what is needed and right now SCORE is needed so pile it all on. It does help a lot that you can buy lunch boxes also. I did do about 80 ACPs in the first few days of it coming out so I am still backlogged on notes.   
---
But in all fairness I run a legacies which make a joke out of everything, also doesn't hurt for the magic mini I have TSFFR90 with an accel barrel I have dropped earl in 22 seconds of the event starting I have dropped the queen in seconds once she lands.
---
We keep technology to preserve it, if it falls in the enemies hand then the wasteland and the world itself is doomed to repeat its actions ü•¥
---
Fantastic Build, gives a bit of a TMNT feel.
---
love how you added that "train Set"
---
very cool
---
Oh okay. I've heard mentions of the interview and the BOS theme before but I didn't know it really existed. Thanks üòÅ
---
If you activate the quest "Stings and Things", and you don't have a Tic  Blood Sack in your inventory, one of the objective markers will point you right to the place.
---
&gt;Sitting on a bunch of unspendable bullion now.
---
I've been burning through mine by buying lunchboxes. Trade in notes for 200/day while spending 300/day on them is helping me avoid maxing out.
---
Jelly! I managed to get the husband to play for a week or two through incessant cajoling, but he loathes the game. He found it far too difficult and confusing. He doesn't mind me jabbering on about it, but my continued efforts to bring him back have fallen flat. 
---
Mind, he's also the kind of gamer that ends up staring at the floor spinning in circles during FPSes.
---
this one literally should have been catch the commie, with all the communist stuff in it
---
You already can, for the same price as any other card.
---
It'd be nice if it was 1000. Not even because 200 &gt; 100. Just for the neatness of it all.
---
Uhhhh......     no?
---
nope, the settlers are boring as hell and only need building supplies as random events in certain places
---
Dude. You need to get out of the house. I was just sharing a glitch... take a breath.
---
Yeah Earle is a massive sponge and the rewards are trash. Less flux. No repairs. A few screws and plans we've all got stashed in abundance now. Oh, and a shitty shovel I can't scrip behind the other 40+ three stars my daily limits and choking me with. 
---
Drowning in legendary shit so bad that I sell them for CAPS to buy ammo these days as there's nothing even the Purveyor has that I want. I'm sitting on like 50 modules with 'close enough' SS armor.
---
So yeah.... Earle is kinda pointless now. If Daily Ops paid out repeatedly in a day you wouldn't even see a nuke I reckon. I'd farm that full time for outfits and plans.
---
You're correct. Scrap is just an item ID and a quantity value. With weapons they have to keep track of level, condition, mods, legendary effects, paints, and probably more that I'm not thinking of, so each one requires a much larger table in the dB.
---
They can be very helpful!  A couple macros on my mouse make the build system less clunky.  I wouldn't worry about a ban they've got bigger bugs to squash, doesn't give you an advantage anyway
---
WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO SCALE ENEMIES TO OUR LEVEL IT LITERALLY MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY THE GAME LESS AND IT‚ÄôS SO DUMB
---
Sad about that too, one of my favorite little dungeons because it was a quick grab'n go
---
I wish they made the next season around Appalachia
---
First element is choice of weapon. Do not use anything with spin up or charge, and sadly avoid melee. I get chumped bad trying to use melee vs freezing robots. Greatest success with exp handmade, LMG, gatling (use it like a semiauto, do not get into spinning it up) or shotgun.
---
Second element is speed of movement. Have squad maneuvers on, you can make a solo roleplay or exploration team that no one will join just to get the bonus. Speed demon is great too. This is useful in all uplink daily ops so you can get from point to point but critical with freezing.
---
Third element is not getting shot 100 times at once, as you can be stunlocked. Hardest with robots due to clustering of gutsies, but the key here is to use cover, move constantly, and try to isolate targets.
---
It also helps a lot to know the map. The layouts are confusing but there are optimal moves.
---
I‚Äôm a heavy gun build and I barely break 1K. Constantly making ammo lol
---
That's fine, I play solo myself, but they time doesn't need to be adjusted for singles.
---
That‚Äôs nonsense üôÑ. *shoots laser beams from eyes*
---
I'll have to go check it out.  I can't think of anything on either side that was an interior space.
---
the gatling plasmas only shoot fog when they're two shot/faster fire rate iirc
---
Yeah, but you need acid for that.
---
I have seen her all over the map. She can spawn anywhere a random human NPC encounter can happen.
---
I love these posts especially before the level changes.  It's so hilarious players just casually doing the quest in the low level pretty easy areas, playing detective.  No warning at all that the last step of the quest is the hardest event in the game.  
---
I feel for those players that do everything in private servers and get absolutely blindsided
---
I‚Äôm a Junkies Unarmed Tank build. And wanted to add a few more bits of advice.
---
Best Underarmor is the Shielded Lining Secret Service one after completing Wastelanders.
---
Best mod for your arms is Brawling, which give you +10% damage for each arm.
---
Lein‚Äôs build is great. I‚Äôd move points out of AGI and into END for Fireproof. Fireproof basically makes you immune to scorchbeast screams and heavily reduces AOE effects in Wendigo Colossus.
---
Finally, Taking One for the Team perk card. If you‚Äôre punching their face, they‚Äôre going to hit you. So rank that up for 40% more damage and you‚Äôre golden.
---
Also, Abestos mod for your chest piece for more AOE protection against Wendigo Colossus.
---
Thank you for the offer, but i got the one from the overseers house.
---
Don't you already have enough of all of those things? The game has been rewarding those as the core rewards since launch.
---
This coming from a raider.
---
It might be nice for the people who want to play solo.
---
I will keep that in mind for the future, thank you.
---
Lol I just thought it was hysterical I was so chill like ‚Äúhey bro just come fast travel to me so we can blast through it‚Äù lmfaoo like yeah you would have fucking thought, boy was I severely caught by surprise. And the quest line is relatively easy and not even that combat oriented from what I remember.
---
Aw man! Would‚Äôve loved to help you out if you were PC. Congrats on SBQ! With the introduction of Earle the Wendigo Colossus, I would suggest to go for him instead because it‚Äôs way more fun (difficult!!!) and intense!
---
Keep in mind majority of players don‚Äôt really browse reddit, so your mileage may vary when you come across survivors in the world!
---
Yea it sucks when i want to sell i just spam A button on my controller
---
You don't understand. The warden wants to MAKE AN EXAMPLE out of him. And then promptly forgets to lock his cell... And Mad Dog Malone? He must really like that run-down Grafton Dam, as there's nowhere else he'd rather be, and, "I'll bet they'll NEVER find me here!"
---
Welp, judging by last season, people were speculating that it would last 76 days (because it looked pretty) instead of 70 (10 weeks).
---
I decided to stick with the 10 weeks count, because that was the official info, and it ended being the correct thing to do.  
---
This season the info they provide is again 10 weeks, they say it here: [ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/43yHXVVJpIawuxYldcXIvi/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-season-2-preview-new-s-c-o-r-e-board-rewards-and)  . And we again probably going to be having a empty week after that before season 3.
---
Too soon dude. I doubt people have earned one for themselves and another to sell. It'll also be going on Discord for trades and shit as it's in demand.
---
Give it a few weeks/months it'll probably be in the train station suitcase lol
---
I imagine there is an unknown vault that keeps making new Mad Dogs over and over again
---
If your not the team leader you can duck into the atomic shop before it searches for a world to join

---
Maybe my perks are set wrong, I have instigating 33/25 and I am not happy with damage.
---
PS4 here, I crash about once per session since the patch dropped.
---
Good luck.
---
Containers reset after you've looted 60 of them.
---
Unfortunately this isn't a trading sub.
---
I'm fairly sure you're also massively underestimating the price of that mask.
---
I still get in at least one earl a day.  To me he has better drops than the queen.  
---
But I agree with everyone else that earl should drop more flux and at least some repair kits...honestly he should drop double the repair kits than SBQ since it takes more to take him down.  I use at least 2 every time I fight him.
---
Wow! Elder rank by yourself?
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
So do pets take up camp budget?
---
yeah, angryturtle said it [in his last commando video](https://youtu.be/Iwke6ZPPOLY). with patch 22, they sadly patched CF so you wont get the 95% on first aim anymore so rank 1 is enough to go for the head. and faster reload is always handy.  
---
ricochet is also from him, i try it instead of bloody mess. its like 15 damage less but definitly worth it for daily ops to tank a little bit more. in regular gameplay, i might go back to bloody mess, bot sure so far
---
Power armor players should just let the smaller guys activate unless they get there first
---
They added a "small backpack" a few months ago because people were complaining about the quest/grind to get the possum pack. It maxes out at +30.
---
Right before you get attacked by the bear, Smokey Bear comes along buys up your ammo too~
---
Not removed but it'd make sense to modify or buff them and then add more on top.
---
The slayer weapons are niche. They should be their very nature be the highest damage weapons because of how niche this is like between 60-100% bonus damage (with final number to be determine through work feels right in testing).
---
As for bloodied/junkies etc. having a flat cap of 50, wouldn't fly either as the drawback for the various builds aren't the same. For example, Junkie's penalties are all but negated if you go 50% health and unyielding armour and you get a damage boost from adrenal reaction.
---
My lady plays it quite a bit, but she's pretty pre-occupied at the moment with her new motorbike project!
---
I think most endgame players are doing elder ranks by themselves.
---
I just had someone yoink a meat tenderizer plan (plus a couple other less valuable rares). I haven't had an issue in 800 hours, until now. At least they didn't get into my legendary weapons. I'm out in the middle of nowhere too, but I was doing a lot of server hopping so I guess RNGesus decided to smite me.
---
It's pretty frustrating when there are several enemies in full view but the trade prompt is up so no VATS. 
---
It would be a lot better if they made it for certain functions like "repairing the beacon" and such, that you'd only need to look in the general direction instead of keeping directly centered on. I remember the other day, something blew up as I was repairing a beacon and some random canister flies across my screen, canceling the repair halfway.
---
It was... interesting. I had to get the Speed Demon serum from the enclave to get it and I got lucky with the spawns of the ending enemies. My time was like 7:56.
---
They changed the way damage is calculated
---
Maybe to stop everyone jumping on at the same time?
---
How long does it take for the uplinks you finish with 1x speed? I can imagine the enemies aren‚Äôt the problem rather the time limits.
---
My research on this sub is filled with a bunch of yes and nos from old post, with no true confirmation, or data from the files. My personal experience with the perk, I sincerely dont see an increment in radious from Grenade Launcher, Auto, Missile or Fatman.
---
I do not. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhunt‚Äù legendaries, I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúroute‚Äù, I don‚Äôt even have an optimized build for my character. I log in, play what/how I want, and log off. 
---
Being rewarded with legendaries (scrip), ammo, and essentially currency is amazing.
---
Couldn‚Äôt they must make each container hold a much smaller more realistic amount?
---
How is it not new content? 
---
It wasn‚Äôt available at all until now. Therefor it‚Äôs new. Could you do daily ops before? Nope. Was the brotherhood ghost guy in the game before? Nope. Are the rewards from the daily op reward pool new or old? New. 
---
The content is new.
---
Is this the vault in the Ash Heap? Also does your guys' map get updated once you find the location? I can see the location symbol on the compass, but there is no way to actually discover the vault location.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what the deal is with them, I had someone drop me a weapon called "Bloodied Grahms The Tenderizer" or something along those lines. Bloodied, FSS, 90%RW and it was invisible when you equipped it. I got rid of it by dumping on a private server and then leaving.
---
I just wish the maps had some easier way to tell where to go. I know I can just go to the location and learn it, but I'd much rather have waypoints, arrows, lights, etc. This sewer is killing me.
---
Ward is Rick Grimes,you do not mess with Rick.
---
around 10% of it yes
---
Damn that's crazy!
---
if i have, say a deathclaw at my mire camp on a lake/swamp, can it drown?
---
its random sadly and with wastelanders tames in general got rarer because of the new random encounters added
---

Darn, thanks though
---
I've been using a vamp handmade on my bloodied toon. I got wrecked by the robots but it works good for the others. I'm trying to put together a set of troubleshooters for the bots. For me the most important perks are blocker, serendipity, ricochet and I replaced dodgy with evasive to save ap.
---
surprised they don't have this yet, seems like such a missed opportunity. i was hunting for one for a friend for christmas :-(
---
*Ugh* ...help me Tom Cruise... so when a glitch is discovered this is how you people behave?
---
DocB30tn.  
---
I'll be on my 2nd char who is in roughly the same spot as my main just N of the way ward. I do now it has plans and other stuff.  
---
I have reddit moble so shoot me a list of stuff and I'll see what I can do. I might drop a bunch of junk as well.
---
What do you mean floaters,arrows,missles,raider armor doesn't make great rewards?
---
It only looks complicated but you can apply these same techniques to make even crazier structures.
---
I'm running 62 INT, dedicated EXP/INT build, are you running 15 standard &amp; the legendary +5?
---
I just machine gun them at people doing events with me. Somehow I never run out.
---
Really not liking the level scaling. I much preferred going around and discovering harder enemies that way. Now I'm just dumping a lot of bullets into everything.
---
Dear Lord those BoS outfits plain are fucking awesome!! So too is the Rifle.
---
Um, Beth, who down there is responsible for taking great outfits and skins, and camp'ing them up to look friggin dazzlingly shit as always??
---
He has 8 Treasury notes.  While that often doesn‚Äôt matter, sometimes people want a buffer.  Especially for people who like to have days that they are not on for long, but want to pick up bullion.
---
You don't even need to enter the mine, simply press the button and chill outside, loot all the junk, or go afk. You even get 10 claim tickets for not doing anything...
---
My PSN is the same as my reddit name. But please dont take this the wrong way, im just one of those weird dudes that wants to earn everything i get rather than have it given to me. I super appreciate the offer tho. It's why i love the community.
---
Thanks for the tips too. I played a ton at launch but the end game was well not really a thing, now theres multiple world bosses and daily dungeons and shit so nows the time to get back into it.
---
My AA Prime Gatling Plasma is my weapon against the SBQ and Earle.  Vampires Prime is the one I use against high damage output enemies such as Super Mutants with Miniguns , Lvl 100 Death Claws, and most importantly, Mirelurk Kings.
---
add me up: imShinbi - PC
---
i can help out if im on and youre always welcome in my communist camp anytime :D
---
I do this all the time, I see anyone under 30 and I‚Äôll drop all sorts of stuff. Plans, weapons, stimpaks, etc. It‚Äôs like this weird tradition where we say hello without words because there‚Äôs no text chat. Like cave ppl making offerings.
---
Yeah they are useless but an easy way to make your caps for the day
---
Also willing to help craft armor if needed
---
Edit: XB1 As well
---
I think you mean bloodied's penalties are negated at 50% health,  right?
---
I did. It is happening to 6 of my friends, 4 of us have always had the issue for nearly two years, and two of our new group friends experienced it too when we tested it. I'm sharing an experience so... idk why all the trolls are hitting this feed so hard. It's not game-breaking, just another bug that I'm getting tired of. I can never use my tesla anymore.

If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Not really if you think about it. Keeps people from duplicating items by buying at the same time
---
The crazy thing is that this is the revision to the live version. There was an even worse version that went live originally.
---
I kind of want to submit it to /r/assholedesign too because putting the most expensive BUY100 option that typically costs 25,000 ammo points one row above the SELL1 option for each item seems like they are intentionally trying to get us to lose all the points that we tediously collected too. Especially since the cursor literally jumps up a row randomly sometimes while tabbing back and forth to sell multiple, nonsensically numbered stacks of worthless ammo.
---
Could you meet me ingame

Daily ops have revitalized specific slayers, hopefully we end up with more predictable opposition in future ones. I was actually happy to see a mutant slayers gatling laser today.
---
Seemingly yes, or maybe just not nerfed as much
---
Actually, a sell all option would be possible. They could run a script that checks the player's inventory and automatically trades in all carried ammo for points.  
---
The downside would be that it would trade **all** tradeable ammo, including the ones you don't want to trade. They would have to also implement some way to tag certain ammo types to not be sold.
---
Maybe if you've reached a point where you can min-max and the way YOU build makes power armor useless for YOU. But we're not talking about you, we're talking about ways that are helpful for a relatively new, level 40 player.
---
there‚Äôs a lot of scamming with trading with other players so watch out for that
---
can't we get coins as rewards instead of packs?
---
And Leader of the Pack now has lvl 60 mongrels, too, yet still only 1-star legendaries as rewards. It's still dead easy, though, just more annoying.
---
I like the radaway and Stims honestly, very good for making caps with little effort.
---
Getting repair kits might be a bit too much, you already get ton of stuff from the daily ops, you only burn some ammo [some weapon types can get surplus] and durability on equipment, which is already halved.
---
They should leave the pistol perks in AGI and move Gun Runner to END and Packing Light to STR.
---
Almost none. My camp sits on a steel extractor so I have an endless supply of steel (raw scrap, does not need to be smelted). And everything that comes out of that extractor goes into my tinker's bench to make railway spikes, ...which I immediately feed into my ammo converter.
---
I don't spend the ammo points right away, I bank them (because they're 'weightless' so to speak, as they take up no space in my own inventory or in my stash). I'm up to several tens of thousands of ammo points now, which I can use to grab a bunch of any ammo type I need at a moment's notice, all for free.
---
I've only gotten those damn burrow signs for 3 days straight now.
---
I guess they make good fuel for my brahmin grill
---
So I'm a pretty casual player on regards to end game min-maxing, I play every day but I'm not gonna be the person solo nuking the queen any time soon. That said, I do just fine roaming around and can clear ops by myself in about 10-12 minutes, not the fastest but it's still doable. I enjoy the story, exploring, scavenging, and building my camp up and all that more than the actual battles for the most part. So I get it, I really do, it's frustrating when the game more or less forces you to change your play style especially when just a week or so ago you could approach it with more QoL perks and still excel to some degree.
---
What I've done to adapt is find a happy medium. I enjoy a high carry weight since I'm a hoarder so I decided to focus on Strength, which naturally increases your carry capacity. So melee, unarmed, and shotguns are good choices because there are perk cards that increase damage for them in the Strength category. My build damage wise is focused around Shotguns, I have a few I rotate around depending on what I'm fighting. And like I said, I'm doing pretty well for myself and my style of play. I still die occasionally, but hey, who doesn't? 
---
I'm rattling on about this because I want to show you that with a little tweaking you can get to a point where you can survive in this game without throwing out everything you like about it. It's different now, bit honestly.not that much - if you played any other Fallout title you know you have to have SOME damage boosts to be able to survive. You don't have to go all out - I certainly haven't, but even one or two damage boosting cards will help. Even just the three level 1 Shotgun or Rifleman or Commando cards will give you +30% damage which is super helpful. Just take a second, decide what kind of weapons you like, and build up from there. I promise it's not bad, just different, and I'm sure you can get used to it.
---
Why not both?
---
That Free States skin for the combat shotgun is...not my favorite.
---
If only you could get mirelurk eggs from something other than that one event.
---
Just commenting here to add this tidbit of info: same spot lvl 50 DC legendary 2* was tameable but didn‚Äôt want such a tempting pet for other players to kill at my camp ü§™
---
This isn't an issue in any other game.
---
Make Nocturnal not go down during the day, just up at night.
---
I would boost the damage against specific groups, ie Exterminators or Assassins.
---
The thing is now that it‚Äôs not multiplicative with all the other effects the damage increasing perks aren‚Äôt nearly as necessary as they were before. I am getting hit a lot harder now and need to do something about that but I‚Äôm still doing good enough damage with only half or 1/3 of the damage perks for my weapon type. I do feel weaker then I think I should be but I‚Äôve mathed it and those extra points in damage would be to minuscule to change that
---
Craft &amp; scrap Teslas to learn auto mod.
---
Yeah after realising my defense stacked stealth sniper is actually an amazing face tank, my gear is getting thoroughly diddled and fucked every time I took on the Assaultron version of Optimus Prime at point blank. I used about 10x of the pissy Basic Repairs so quickly. 
---
Not a bullet slipped by as I took all of em lolz. Objective achieved.
---
My bloodied experimental mirv doest kill lvl75 ghouls.
---
Now that redundant perks not only have a purpose but are sought after I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they actually toned back the amount of perk packs given since they want a grind
---
lol wtf
---
This is the right answer.
---
1k sounds good
---
There‚Äôs a small peninsula south of the lumber mill in the north west. Best place for random npc encounters. Anything from the settler wonderer, cultists to rare traders. Be warned, after five of her in your camp you‚Äôll wish you could kill your ally.
---
I find her at Lost homes in the bog fairly often when I'm server hopping for the rare scavenger trader. It might take you a while, but she does spawn there.
---
Many are things you may eventually reach if you play long enough, this is a game intended to last for years, but for It to do so people need to buy atoms.  The 10-70  dollars people purchased the game with will not support developers making new content, servers and the company making a profit for long.
---
I haven‚Äôt spent any money on atoms yet but tbh if they start selling perk packs in the shop I might buy a bunch just to jumpstart on these legendarys
---
Level 18 right now. Good to know I'm ahead of the curve this early. Your spreadsheet really helped me out last time!!
---
Also get ready for a glitch or a player to kill your pet:(
---
Can we replace the floater grenades while we're at it?
---
I have two uny Thorn pieces, rolling one every day since May.  Good luck.
---
Spoiler (maybe): I started reading this thinking you were gonna start talking about how after listening to the holotapes that the dude was trying to build a sex robot out of a hybrid between an assaultron and a sheep. Baaaaaaaaaaa
---
Just killed him 5 min ago and got an assassin‚Äôs knuckle
---
Hacked weapons and people who cant even kill a ghoul without using hacked weapons
---
Of course, all are welcome. I'll look for ya.
---
Giving nukashine is a straight up spit in the face from Bethesda. ‚ÄúCongratulations your reward fro countless grinding is -10 carry wight.‚Äù
---
Lol nowadays yea.
---
Yep, unfortunately it's only that size on the map.
---
It's a bug when you've recently been on a NW server with a nuke zone before switching to adventure.
---
Thats what happens when you launch all 3 nukes at the same time in the same spot. /s
---
Fuck just take the damn plan out of the bullion recipe pool and make it a regular so we can sell or trade them. Its dumb to give them as a quest reward and not be able to sell them. Since they cant be sold they dont show up in the vendor screen, guess who had 87 fucking pounds of the damn things and could not figure out where the extra weight was.
---
I just by stuff from vendors
---
Bad bot
---
39k.  It is stacking up because I've been running the slug buster lately.
---
Is your gt same as your username here? Would be glad to have ya.
---
Mostly I was adressing the part that requries meticulous repeating of the same steps that also involve another person (who also needs to be careful enough not to break something else by accident because it might lead to unpredictable consequences. With how buggy this building system is, you never know, right?) Other stuff not that much, it's pretty straightforward and rather easy to pull off.
---
Can we also use caps for the legendary run
---
I just got it from Ops and i have no idea where it is or what it does
---
Nope you're playing it right. It's a survival game. 
---
Find a good melee weapon and use it to reduce your ammo needs. Any board with a nail in it will do. Maybe you can cobble something together or murder a super mutant for theirs. 
---
Junk is all over the place, some easier to find than others, but if you look around (bring your board with a nail in it) you'll find stuff you can use. 
---
For the weapons breaking, it's the same problem as junk. You have to find what you need to fix it. However, the melee thing will also reduce wear and tear on the guns.
---
I would rather not have repair kits, im sitting on 93 of the improved kit and seem to get more faster than I can use them.
---
Oh yeah, i was playing NW! Thanks for the explanation!
---
You are *not* guaranteed. The highest tier, Elder, has an 80% chance. And if you get Elder on your first try, it's still only an \~83% chance of getting a rare drop from all 3 rolls combined. Of course, there's also a VERY small chance of getting up to 3 rare rewards in one day as well. 
---
And once you've rolled a Tier for that day, it will NOT roll again that day.
---
I don't know where you got that info, but it's not even close to being right.
---
Run from the cemetery to the fairgrounds on the far West of the map and you should find quite a few random events/npcs along the river and around the road. It only took me 4 runs to find her.
---
Lol i had no idea thanks for the info
---
Everyone - I need to take advantage of perk system and legendary perks better now!
---
Meanwhile me - LEGENDARY STRENGTH GOES BONK!
---
I didn't even get to swap my armor for an apropriate level legendaries for god's sake and I'm feeling STRONGER, not weaker for some reason. This whole patch is a giant throwback on every forum for me.
---
Here I thought it was a conga line ;-)
---
Thank you :)
---
It's not the game became hard...the game just became HARDER. Meaning it's only a little bit more challenging. Most players didn't want to adapt to new difficulty when it was already too easy before one wasteland with weaker weapons, and that is what the biggest problem was. It was there inability to grasp that they were already WAY overpowered.
---
Sure adjustments need to be made, esp for mid game players since enemy health increases by x3 between 15-25 and damage doesn't scale for player weapons appropriately.
---
However this update is so good for the game just from daily ops alone. Players from the very start been begging for more challenging content where you work together to overcome it.
---
What a lot of players don't understand is that there is no way they could have added new perks/ability/legendary effects/4 and 5 star weapons without scaling things back a little first in order for more progress to be brought forward in terms if how many effects that can stack when you get 5 effects per armor instead of 3.
---
When you already got legendary 3 star god rolls that make the content trivial then how in god's name would anything more stacked be any less BROKEN? The game needed a  serious change, eventually players will start getting all that lost power back.
---
There is also a rock and roll jukebox in the cellar of the Free Radicals camp.
---
Nope, he still shows up all the time.
---
Would be nice if when you opened a Card pack you had the option to scrap all cards after the animation plays if you don‚Äôt need any in the pack
---
Unfortunately it can happen.
---
You won't do that with the freeze mechanic occurring over and over lol
---
Nope. Only another player, mob or new tame can make it go away afaik.
---
I got it using the sleeping bag on the Watoga station platform. Make sure you‚Äôre hungry thirsty.
---
I tame at maxed budget so no.
---
To be honest, there's a new patch that has made it difficult for many new players. Try to hang in there! Carry more than one weapon and switch when you need to.
---
I just think it‚Äôs lame it takes a minimum of 9 levels to max out 1 single weapon type with so many other busywork perks that are almost a necessity. Basically I think I‚Äôll just have to adjust them on the fly past level 50. I‚Äôd agree that would be much better tho, maybe only be able to level it up every ten levels or so.
---
Great post. One of the dataminers also figured out you only need rank 1 or 2 animal friend to tame most creatures, only things like deathclaws and megasloths require rank 3. [https://imgur.com/a/udXzWiK](https://imgur.com/a/udXzWiK)
---
And you don't have to be twice the level of the tamed creature.

Cranberry Glade and Berkeley Springs is where I see them most often.
---
Lol mine loves fornite atm. I got him started from splatoon to elder scrolls and now he's on fornite lol. Very random guy but I gotta make sure to catch his interests hard when he plays so he'll want to keep come back lol. I hope he gets back into it, I've always seen posts from couples playing and I want to have that kind of fun with my guy and hopefully get him off of fornite lol
---
Nocturnal would actually be viable. It's the only legendary effect with a debuff.
---
I'm getting about 4-5k with a couple lunchboxes and casual play.
---
There is a new area in the Bog between Sunshine Farm and Lost Home.  A large abandoned hight tech farm with dead Utility Protectrons.
---
i want it but don‚Äôt have the game. can you buy fallout 76 for me?
---
It'd be rad if they fired tracer bullets, too.
---
You have to wait a little for them to show up
---
Love it, but cant find people after hour or so of reset
---
Good to know is helping!, i just added another function! now it will also estimate when you are going to finish!
---
This is actually huge news! I will amend the post!
---
As soon as I found out that you could buy lunchboxes, I bought 50.
---
The house just north of Camden Park on highway 81 has a cockroach sitting on a toilet with a cane, bowler hat and wedding ring.
---
I'm really happy to see a post like this. I've very much championed that all you need to do is adapt a little and the game is perfectly manageable.
---
Glad to see that it worked out for you.
---
Just put some raw copper wood and fertilizer next to the bike, Maybe that will get her thinking about fallout again lol :)
---
thats pretty damn awesome actually.
---
The fo76 community has standards. 
---
Now that i think about it...maybe that's why bethesda get's criticized so much.
---
Lvl 3 Born Survivor is a Perk I run if I'm facing the SBQ or Earle.  I can stand right under Earle or in front of the SBQ and see it proc repeatedly.
---
THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES
---
Easy fix would be to give each player their own buying inventory that is random, if they happen to get the same item as another player...so what?
---
There's also the fact that you can just find them randomly in the wild. Should either buff them a lot or swap out the gold plan with something new and refund anyone who has the plans their gold back.
---
Do use the bullet shield perk? I do and very rarely have to repair my Excavator Armour
---
I use a mirv junkie's so i am actually happy when i get mini nukes now :).
---
To each their own, i spam nuka grenades and mini nukes in daily ops. Mad Exp brah.
---
My opinions:  
---
- Stalker's should be removed from melee legendary pool.  
---
- Cloaking should be removed entirely, unless i'm wrong and people *do* actually use it.  
---
- Weightless should have 0 DR, so it pairs up with Berserkers.  
---
- Diurnal should be added to compliment Nocturnal, the drawback being you need two sets of gear and to watch that clock.  
---
- Assassin's armor should be changed to apply to human enemies, like the weapons were. Make old version legacy, or a seperate effect for PVPers.  
---
- Slayer's should be left as-is, because they have no drawback. When you compare it to Berserker's after Patch 22, it is actually pretty good.  
---
- Melee could use a 25% less AP cost tertiary effect now that Hack And Slash makes them AP-dependant.  
---
- Vampires *could* be a secondary effect instead of a primary on melee due to lower hits per second, even if it no longer synced with Ricochet.  
---
- Either remove Limb Damage from melee legendary pool, *or* make Concentrated Fire work with melee.  
---
- Change 50DR/250DR secondary effects to be a percentage of damage reduced.  
---
- Maybe increase the speed boost of FMSWA.  
---
- Make 90% Weight Reduction include the weight of mods on ranged weapons.  
---
- Increase bash damage secondary effect, or increase bash speed whilst reducing the AP cost.  
---
- Maybe make Medic's scale with damage dealt, *or* make it heal over time to function like a damage dampener which stacks to a max amount.  
---
- Maybe tweak the percentage on Auto-Stim to 10%, and each raises it by 10% while reducing the cooldown by 10 seconds to a minimum of 20 seconds or something like that. Life Saving is better than rank 3 Mysterious Saviour, whereas Auto-Stim is inferior to rank 1 Born Survivor. Needs adjusting in some way, or just remove entirely.
---
These are just ideas. A lot of these effects I don't use myself because I find them completely unappealing, and in so may be wrong in thinking they need adjusting at all. If people think some of the effects I suggested changing are fine as-is because they currently use them, then I stand corrected. Even so, I submitted feedback [here.](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F)
---
We throw nukes for profit and fun pal, I don't think we have the right to call people blood thristy maniacs.
---
Honestly when the Brotherhood arrives they should be hostile to us.
---
3* blocker perk, never worry about ghouls and dogs again!
---
Nice
---
I would honestly take Nuka-Cola Quantum over the Nukashine and craft the latter using the former if I felt like it. Nuka Quantum is useful in more ways than just a meme consumable.
---
This is anti-foundation propaganda commie. 
---
Prepare to accept democracy! 
---
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!
---
Not ore, just a few pieces of scrap like steel and concrete.
---
I couldn‚Äôt see the video since it was not loading at all but a scoped lever action can one shot anyone as long as it‚Äôs a head shot. 
---
Handmade and some of the other autos can seem like a one shot as well if all it‚Äôs shots are to the head.
---
If only. Massive nuke zones would be awesome.
---
How are they underrated? They are the best out of the bunch. With four maxed legendary SPECIAL cards (and Funky Duds because FUCK poison) I can seemingly switch to any class of weapon in seconds.
---
Farming XP? Get that Stealth Commando with Unyielding for insane intelligence. Doing Daily Ops? Hop into the PA and bust out the heavies. Resilient is in today? Switch out perks with three button presses thanks to [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) and go to town on them.
---
I think it's pretty agreed on that SPECIAL legendary cards are the best ones. Funky Duds and Follow Through are very good. Ammosmith is also insane, but you don't need to keep it on at all times, just switch it on when whenever you're going to use it. Taking One for the Team can be good too. The rest is just kinda meh.
---
No but they can give you a free set of t-51b armour!
---
I for one would rather carry a level 2 who did no damage but stood in the freaking signal zones than have a level 10k player who wanders around outside the zone instantly killing things. So as long as you are doing that and doing what you can you shouldn't have too much trouble, unless it's robots, because the robots are something else.
---
it real life!?!!!!
---
Really? Even with full health and marine armour?
---
Darn I gotta get me one of those. If that‚Äôs the case then I guess this guy is just god tier from how fast he reacted to me.
---
There's the small backpack at the morgantown airport and then the regular backpack from the tadpole quest where you will need 3 tadpole badges to get. Once you get that backpack when you craft one you'll notice it has levels and the higher the level the more it carries. The possum badges are for the mods for that backpack.
---
Glad you're sticking it out. Turrets seem to be a pretty effective defense now too. I had minimum level turrets taking out scorched faster than I could defending a workshop. No reason they wouldn't also help with your super mutants.
---
Just over 122k, thanks to the Line in the Sand and the stack of Guns and Bullets 5 I bought.
---
Thank you for the info! I recently gave my TS grenade launchers a try for the chuckles and wasn't sure. Will also do my own testing but this is great to know :)
---
I've tried finding sellers but usually I just find some guy selling bone shards.
---
The hunting rifle one shots as well but not always if someone has lifegiver and some of the perks that increase defense.
---
Bloody mess, Rifleman, tank killer, long shot is what you‚Äôll need if you want to long shot long distances easily.
---
I usually go in solo and sometimes I can take out full teams far away where they can‚Äôt see me because I can see them via  scope from far away. It‚Äôs funny when they peak out of corners to see wtf is going on or revive someone and get head shot. 
---
My build is rifleman, commando, long shot, bloody mess, ironclad, frog legs, tank killer.
---
Thats exactly the one thank you so much
---
Daily Ops are your friend. You usually get 220 ammo for your current equipped gun for completely it at any tier and you get 5 mins post Op to run around and grab ammo off every body (tons of enemies) before it boots you. Each body usually has 6-16 ammo for your currently equipped gun in my experience.
---
If you're low level and worried about running the Op, don't be. I started running them around lvl 20. I was really struggling with ammo when the new patch dropped, but now I run three Ops first thing when I get on and now I'm swiming in .45 and 5.56 ammo.
---
Plus you should average 1000 XP a run. I usually play two hours every night and went from lvl 20 to lvl 35 in three days mainly due to the Daily Ops.
---
I currently am camped at that one
---
Finishing on elder solo is not hard at all. It is kind of a rush at the end sometimes to kill the required enemies and the boss, however I have managed all of them minus the burning mine because that place is too confusing for me.
---
I'm just happy I used to go to the Burrows hunting legendary a lot, so I am pretty comfortable with the  layout. I  truly feel for you guys that are new to the labyrinth.
---
No shit, player levels don't rly matter in this event. The highlvls getting kicked just as everyone does. The bravest of us go to these hills to die and give you guys a chance to shoot it.
---
Gonna get downvoted but imo the plans are too common, cant even sell them anymore so i drop them , i have 3 mules with max filled with scrip weapons.
---
Really not much point in doing ACP atm.This game is seriously starting to lack content, Yes Daily Ops was added but its not much of end game content.
---
But in the end i probably got most of any game i ever played exept Eso so i guess its good to take a break soon again from the Wasteland until the Bos things release
---
As a furry with a wiffle bat. My main objective isn't to kill with it, just beat the shit out of them with a plastic toy.
---
I‚Äôll definitely try it out thanks, I was afraid to just waste ammo and get wrecked or be a weak link when other people were trying to complete it.
---
Can you tame more than one creature?
---
Didnt think to try that thanks for the tip
---
Only one at a time, unfortunately. I want a menagerie!
---
I'm not a power armor user but seeing the plain hellfire suit like that makes me want to start using power armor
---
Mate, what? These legendary cards have been removed from the PTS for months and never made it into the base game, and even if they had they'd take into consideration a full set of armor and not your outfit.
---
I'll also put up a fallout poster in the garage üòÖ
---
A tip that helped me early on was to only keep 200 of all junk items. I learned from there which ones I used a lot of (lead,steel) and which ones I didn‚Äôt need a lot of(bone, fertilizer). Tadpole and Possum badges are under your ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù challenges list.
---
More like a sociopath
---
So  I have a question. While all of you high level players sit there  mocking lower level players about how funny it is to watch our confusion  and frustration with this patch ‚Äî those of us who just recently started  playing, have not invested thousands of hours like you have, or simply  play the game differently from you ‚Äî can anyone explain how this update  is a GOOD thing for someone like me who's a level 45? Or more  importantly, how this is supposed to be FUN for me now?
---
I  don't have a ton of time in the world to play. So when the Wastelanders  update came out I decided to give FO76 a shot, and I honestly really  like(d) it. I've loved FO3, NV, FO4, and am okay and accepting of all  the Bethesda Bugs and issues with these games. I was okay with the  glitches and goofy stuff in 76. I've never once hopped on a forum to  complain about a patch or a bug; it's just part of it, and I accepted  that when I fired up a Bethesda game. I even signed up for FO 1st and  have paid $13/mo for the last 3 months, enjoying the game.
---
I  play with a small group, and we're all around level 40-60. I also play a  lot solo ‚Äî that $13/mo is basically buying me the option to play FO76  as a singleplayer game when my friends aren't online, I don't feel like  being mini-gunned by some level 432 asshole, or just feel like exploring  these giant open world wastelands that I love in Fallout games.
---
But  now? Unless I'm missing something, update 22 has made the game an  unplayable grind for me. I spawned at my house near the airport, and  instead of just sniping down the couple of Level 1 scorched that always  roam there, I found myself in a huge firefight with a dozen Level 41  scorched, which were bullet sponges for my combat shotgun. I ran to some  nearby house or manor (can't remember where) and churned through all of  my ammo, broke 2 of my favorite guns, and used half a dozen medkits  just fighting off Level 41 mole rats and ghouls. As a lower-level player  this was decidedly NOT fun.
---
So  here I am googling the patch, assuming that everyone hates it as much as  I do, but what I'm finding is that you longtime high-level players have  a reason to like it. I'm reading posts from all these people who have  multiple builds, and are level 300+ and have played since the beta and  are bored with one-shotting everything in the game. I get it, you want  more challenging enemies and your characters and weapons are now far too  powerful for the game to handle anymore. So this patch is your answer.
---
But  how is this supposed to be fun for me? Playing singleplayer is  pointless (there is no way I will be renewing FO 1st now, as the private  server for myself is no longer fun)... weak low-level enemies that I  should just be able to chew up on my way to explore and find harder  challenges are now consuming everything I do. I waste all of my ammo,  stimpaks and break weapons constantly, just fighting hordes of  "low-level" Level 41 mole rats, scorched and ghouls. I can't imagine  what it will be like to find a deathclaw or sasquatch now. Or is that  the secret sauce? That the "harder" enemies are more manageable but the  lower level enemies are an ammo-eating nightmare (when they come at you  in large numbers, like say in Morgantown)?
---
So  what can a Level 45 player do in this game for fun now, since Update 22  has made basic exploring and shooting down cheap enemies now a long,  frustrating, ammo-wasting, weapon-breaking slog? I really do want to  keep playing, but since we're not Level 300's looking for ghouls and  mole rats to be a challenge, we are just plain not having fun. Am I  missing something?
---
Can you NOT get deep pocketed for the legs?  I haven‚Äôt seen a deep pocketed leg plan in the vault.  What would you suggest as the 2nd mod for the legs if deep pocketed isn‚Äôt an option?
---
I agree.  My favorite pic of a deathclaw:

yo why do people nuke the top left of the map? genuine question
---
its a cabin you can build at your camp to cure diseases. cant say where its in the build menu, dont got it so far.
---
I love that attitude. It's the right one for FO76 and I think your character will grow very quickly :)
---
Well, if you ever want someone to run with when xping or whatnot my PSN is same as Reddit user name as well!
---
Wait, so does it have to be half your level?
---
Lots of weapons are currently not showing on displays, Bethesda is aware and "working on a fix"
---
So anytime between patch 23 and the year 2100 it may get fixed.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a theramin in the game
---
Apparently not! The linked vid above shows a level 11 taming a level 21 Deathclaw! Go forth and tame!
---
I had a tamed deathclaw and when I met a tameable mirelurk king it gave me a prompt to tame it. I decided not to risk it, since I'd heard pets might disappear if you go over 90% of camp budget. I mean 2 pets would need 20% free is what I was thinking.
---
I‚Äôm not ‚Äúas good‚Äù as most of the other players here and am always running out of screws, so I personally love the event, though I‚Äôll admit I spent more time killing spawns for loot then I do Earle himself
---
Oh for sure.
---
If they eventually make some for the other factions, that‚Äôs good enough for me. I‚Äôve never been a huge BoS person and would rather have something for the Enclave, since this is the first game where they‚Äôre playable and maybe not genocidal manics just yet.
---
Even freezing? Yeah I can imagine it‚Äôs tense going, sounds like it would be fun. What build are you guys running?
---
Imagine if the regular nuke in the center is the blast zone and the larger circle is an area with nuclear fallout in the air. That‚Äôd be awesome, I wish nukes had map wide effects, that progressively intensify the closer you get to it.
---
You don't need ANY budget free to tame. I maxed mine out and have no issues.
---
Ugh me too! He did one quest and decided he doesn't like it and just went back to day z with his friends. With all the time he plays playing video games I wish he'd at least try it out more with me!
---
Well, yes, it's kind of lame, same as the low stash space making players to buy F1st for the scrapbox (which is almost a must have item for level 100+ players). 
---
My guess, they weren't selling enough atoms as they thought/intended to, so they reduced them by only giving 2000 in a 10 weeks period making players to eventually buy them with real money if they want something from the atomic shop. I don't have a lot of complains about that because atoms are just aesthetics not a pay 2 win, unlike the scrapbox that is clearly a pay 2 win. 
---
It's all about the moneh boah!
---
You take an odd approach to agreeing with what I said. I took Follow Through and the rest go into SPECIALs. Ammosmith doesn't help my build. I walked into daily ops with about 400 shells and left with over 800.
---
I played this game for a year straight and about a month ago I finally decided "let me try this thing out" after not believing the negative reviews. I spent about 30 minutes scrapping random shit, it took forever constantly going back and forth between menus... Then it was time to cash in. I went to make my shotgun ammo and..... It's gone. Yup it's gone, I accidentally scrapped all the ammo I made because I was so bored I turned my brain off and just clicked stuff until I wasted my time. I haven't played the game since that day. I had big plans for my build and my camp too, but that was kinda the last straw for me.
---
I feel you bro üòÇ.
---
This happened to my harpoon gun in the heavy cases too, the others seem to be working
---
I'd like it to be exactly the same UI as a vendor bot. Select your ammo to sell or buy slide to choose qty. And done. It would be an ammo vendor with its own currency at your base. When I return to my base after a West Tek steel run I can dump all the ammo like nukes and missiles I don't want then buy what I do want since we can't sell the crap for caps unless we put it in our own vendor but how many people actually sell all those build up .38s 308s and shotgun shells lol
---
Just make sure you have a good gun (guessing you're using a Combat Rifle, which is good) and have all the Commando or Rifleman (Commando is better) perk cards available to you.
---
Most enemies will be lvl 30 for you since that's the minimum, I believe. So you won't gain too much ammo at first, until you level up a few times, get more damage perks and get a higher level combat rifle. Some enemies will be lvl 50-60, shoot them and let your higher level comrades finish them.
---
STAY WITH YOUR TEAM! Very important! You get a bonus for being together near the beacons. This will be a major contribution to your team that will be appreciated since you're getting carried, technically.
---
Happy scavaging!
---
I'm on pc, send me your ign.
---
I usually sell mine for 15 - 30 caps each depending on the charge and they tend to sell well. I only carry 3 on me at all times in case I need to do SQB, Earle or mining lead. Don't use my PA much.
---
Welcome to the Appalachian chapter of the Pioneer Scouts!  Head on up to the Pioneer Scout Camp in the strangely beautiful Toxic Valley and begin your journey.
---
Personally I am Heavy Weapon Junkie PA build. Electric Absorbtion is going to be your best friend, negates all energy damage by healing you 20% of the time at max rank from said energy damage. I don't kill anything or move from uplinks until I have to, so while it does take longer solo, it's not really all that involving.
---
[Use this map](https://map76.com/) and search for "LiteAlly"....they're everywhere!
---
Ya that's the one I got.  The small one at the start and the regular once I did all the other crap.
---
Don‚Äôt the bodies become meat piles? They usually are for me once I complete the mission and go back to the uplink areas to loot.
---
There's no real wrong way to play the game. However, you thought that if you're running out of ammo and junk that maybe you need to do something to fix those things?
---
It's really basic no-brainer stuff like:
---
* If it takes more than say 6ish bullets to kill a basic enemy, maybe it's too tough for you and you should stick to enemies that take fewer rounds to kill.
---
* Use a melee weapon more often to save on ammo
---
* Use different ranged weapons with different rounds to spread out the load
---
* Save only your best weapons for tough enemies and use a lower powered one for weaker enemies
---
* Most junk is plentiful so just go out and find it. Alternatively, work out why you're using so much junk and deal with that.
---
It's really not that hard if you think about it for a moment.
---
Hahaha.. gotcha. Let's hope sooner rather than later
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll check over there tomorrow.
---
I believe you have enough time to get all the uplink solo and still have about a minute and a half to spare
---
You don't have to go into a private server to dump stuff where nobody will find it. You can just go into any instanced interior, such as the Wayward or many many others, and drop the stuff in there. Nobody can get to it, as long as you're not a public team leader (otherwise teammates can enter *your* instance). Anything you drop in an instanced interior is immediately lost forever when you log off.
---
I guess I've just been rewarded with enough of all that stuff so far.
---
You can also get mods from Foundation and Crater. Foundation has Grocers which is reduced food weight, and Crater has Chemists which is reduced chems weight. I personally use Chemists.
---
The problem isn't the backpack mod. The problem is you.
---
Work out what you're hoarding and don't hoard it. You don't need hundreds of chems or thousands of junk. Don't hoard weapons or food either. Just keep the 1-2 weapons you need on you and 1-2 maybe as a situational backup. Junk/scrip/sell the test.
---
Also some items are much heavier than you think. Think gunpowder, stims, water etc.
---
All getting a backpack mod to increase your personal inventory will do is delay the inevitable. You need to get on top of your hoarding and be sensible about what you keep.
---
Make throwing knives or tomahawks at weapons bench. It saves a lot of ammo during the early game.
---
Melee could also solve your problem on ammo.
---
If your still having problems find or buy a railway rifle and just make rail spikes. It does tons of damage while only using ammo that takes steel to craft.
---
Wait until the Mutation: Resilient is back on rotation
---
Yes ...out of range they are needlessly turning into resource eating meat piles for the entire mission.
---
"Say goodbye"
---
Yeah I wish bodies would turn to meat piles quicker, especially in events. I know it‚Äôs not ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù or cool-looking but it‚Äôs much more practical...
---
Agreed!
---
I keep getting the symptomatic... at least that appears to be tradable.
---
Yeah, bodies could probably be handled smarter. I can't imagine that Bloody Mess or the corpse explosions are particually efficient to render and calculate. Perhaps it'd help if instead of gore persisting, such enemies immediately turned into the gore piles much as with what happens with energy/plasma weaponry.
---
No thanks. I'd rather the radaway. At least I can sell that.
---
I think you could get it from those baby spawns from the mirelurk queen. Kill her off and let them jump you a few minutes.
---
Yeah, camp items are tradeable. I was able to buy caged lights off of a friend.
---
Always fun to watch a distant fireball
---
Same. I just tag him here and there unless I'm solo
---
Testify!
---
I'm taking an extended break but I'll pop on here and there and if I see him, I'll drop a few hundred stacks of building materials for him. Steel, Wood, Concrete etc.
---
No, but that is a good idea that is an extra 10%. I think with the legendary perk you would cap at 72 being the highest int possible (that includes weird shit like night person active and being in a casual group) so 149% xp so it looks like a max of 312% is possible if cranberry nuka (with cola nut) stacks with cranberry relish. Gotta say haven't tried that combo yet I know cranberry juice doesn't stack with it but being nuka I wonder if it does.   
---
Another thing worth mentioning is there are 4 base xp models for mobs and certain mobs trigger a 3% gain from int, I would have to look it up but the math was on the money for medium base mobs. Maybe I will hunt down that dataminer info tomorrow.   
---
Also killing a 100 glowing hermit crab have you managed to break 4k XP from one no matter what I do stack try it doesn't go higher than 4k for me. ML queens seem to be capped at 3k
---
The current Hellfire PA looks like ass. I have it unlocked but never use it.
---
Any info on how to accomplish this? Sounds epic, and my reactor chamber just isn't working lol
---
Exactly - Would save them time and effort just to release clean versions to a better reception. &lt;=/
---
Our thinking is far too practical and the expectations too realistic for us to be heard....
---
A problem on my end i cannot fix due to the limitations of the console.
---
So yeah it's kinda everyone's problem..... at least on xbox one.
---
Check data tab, should be under daily.
---
Somebody can‚Äôt get a kill ü§≠
---
&gt; There was an even worse version that went live originally.
---
True. As scary as it sounds.
---
Whoops didn‚Äôt mean to have you respond to the comment since I decided to reword the whole thing. üòÖ I deleted it when I did t see your comment. ( that was a pretty fast reply )
---
Well anyway try doing some work on your console such as cleaning it and rebuilding data base. It should help.
---
One shouldn't overlook ammo, either. Certain types are particularly heavy, or have weights that would appear unassuming but add up quickly. Cryo cells, arrows, bolts, 40mm grenades, .50 caliber ball, harpoons, railway spikes, flares... In earlier levels I liked to try to keep about 1000 rounds of each type in reserve in case I came across a weapon I wanted to try out, but slimming out that ammo has helped my stash quite a bit. I still pick it up, but I feed it to the converter and that sort of acts as a storage expansion since I can keep much less ammo in my stash.
---
Great idea. There‚Äôs nothing I want to buy so I‚Äôm just sitting at my cap of 5000 gold
---
It could be at the valley galleria in which case the quest indicator is a door not a circle
---
I have founder her twice in the mini estuary by the sunshine food factory worskhop in the forest
---
Ok, I will check that out tommorow
---
I found her just south of the Wayward, about halfway to flatwoods.
---
No thanks, I appreciate the offer though.
---
Yeah well the boss spawn in the last area is rng, all can really think of.
---
switch the barrel whenever someone launches a nuke on the queen or earle. I believe the vaporization nozzle is broken and has like 1 range instead of just reduced range, but when you switch the barrel (doesn't matter which) it gets reset.
---
the flamer is actually one of the best kept secrets of the game. with the vaporization nozzle, I think it out-dps the gauss minigun.
---
No, I checked every quest in the pipboy and it's not there, only greyed out in the completed quests section
---
How much budget do pets take up anyway? I've always considered trying to find one but didn't want it to eat up a chunk of space that would be difficult to get back.
---
I keep a vendor of just clothing and it makes me more caps than stimpacks and chems (though not as much as ammo). I have vendors for the players who need/want certain things, not for people who, for some strange reason, think they‚Äôll get legendaries for min-max playing. Go to the exchange for that. I used to keep a sign up that said ‚ÄúNo Legendaries find yer own.‚Äù Not a waste to come to my camp, since I do sell bulked resources for 2 caps per unit scrap in whatever kind of bulk bundle it is and I leave my purifiers and resource extractors + collectron unlocked and clearly labeled FREE for people.
---
Some of us like to dress up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'd rather something better, but it's not I don't want it at all - radaway is good for Alt characters.
---
Same with the 2500caps tiles, near the end of the legendary run, I claimed them all on my (at the time) lv5 alt, rolling in dough she was.
---
They used to take 10%, then it glitched out and they didn't anymore, then the glitch was made official. So, not anymore. =)
---
Not a rumour, Beth actually said that
---
Yeah, gunpowder killed me at lower levels. I didn't expect it to weigh as much as it did. Gained back 100 mystery units out of my stash after that.
---
None. I tame at max budget.
---
The gold skin is baller.
---
Well its just that it takes forever to find a game, the gameplay is not optimised for pvp and honestly if I want some quality pvp I have plenty more games out there. Its just a waste of time really, but you do you if shitty broken game mode is your thing
---
I was told that 4k is cap for any enemy?
---
I would like to get 4k as much as possible but bobble heads &amp; magazines are very time consuming to find. Berry mentats is my favourite. The numbers go a bit strange when sometimes they give you +5 INT and other times +4.3 INT?
---
I use to get 72 INT pre patch but thankfully they buffed the enemies level so the recieved EXP is greater.
---
I agree. I do play it once in a while but its just not tge same game. I play fallout 76 beacuse of open world fun. I dont play fallout 76 for its "groundbreaking competitive pvp". Plus its not always populated so you cant always play it
---
Check out the look in his eyes when he tells you that the bone saw hasn't been used yet. Terrifying.
---
I‚Äôve heard that many people rather have regular camp fences too rather than the communist painted version currently.
---
We are all russian bots here friend.
---
Oh its a camp item
---
Niceeee
---
Where was this? The only time I heard of this was some random guy talking about it.
---
Because some dipshit would immediately end up selling all of their ammo or buying a bunch of ammo they didn't need and come here screaming about how Bethesda ruined the game for them. Having to repeatedly turn in or redeem ammo is monotonous, but it's also relatively idiot proof since you can only loose so much ammo or points at once.
---
I had a Ghoul get a foot stuck in a catwalk and it was hanging under it. When crouched it looked like it was dropping from the ceiling to grab me. 
---
Lost all those pics when I created my alt though, as my mains photos somehow got over written with the new ones.
---
I like well designed spreadsheets. Thanks!
---
I absolutely could not find my way to the boss in the burrows today and the randos I joined bailed so I lost their indicators to find my way. Feelsbad.
---
I- 
---
Bethesda why ._.
---
Thou grow weary of worshipping thine Lord?
---
Heretic! Unbeliever!!
---
Thou art not worthy to worship his Sacred Visage!
---
That doesn't answer the question though. It's easy enough to go over budget due to various bugs and exploits and the game wouldn't necessarily be able to check your budget while you're out taming something so it's entirely possible that even at max budget the creature is still costing something, unless someone that has tamed with budget to spare can confirm or deny otherwise.
---
At this point the lore is up to us so yeah, Brickhouse said this.
---
I use an instagating riffel and sometimes see this happen too
---
It's definitely more difficult to hit elder on Burrows than Vault 94 or Valley Galleria. I might just have a bad route, but it seems the distances are just a little longer. 
---
The boss also isn't super consistent in where he appears in today's Op compared to previous days, and the layout of the area where he appears is also a factor. 2 times I've failed elder because I couldn't find the damn guy in time, and he wasn't where I found him last time :(
---
I've gotten 5 of them, and half of my runs have been no rewards. (been running 4 characters each day)
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
You need to train yourself not to use the pipboy button to back out of VATS. Use the VATS button instead! Yes, it works. I still forget to use it too often though.
---
Bro, I already made a6 step plan on how to easily complete ops yet no one has even viewed it. Canon guys
---
*Morgan Freeman* I can smell you
---
The best place to server hop is the one near the overpass between Bog Town and Cranberry Glade. I've had everything from Scorched Megasloths to Deathclaws spawning there in the small circular patch with no grass- often enough that I can go "pick my boy up from daycare" every time camp attackers "decide to have a party at my house".  
---

Are you Zeldwarf by any chance? She used to make camps like that when I still played
---
Thank you! He‚Äôd love it!
---
Oh, good point! Hadn‚Äôt thought to take advantage of the photography opportunities bugged enemies that still look alive and well grant us!
---
I agree! Get rid of the Rad-aways!
---
They pull us away from Atom's divine light!
---
Embrace the glow! Embrace the glory of Atom!
---
I vendor at least 10 rad aways everyday , they're so common. so having them as a reward is silly. stimpacks are practical healingitems so i get it. even if you're overflowing with them its useful, but radaway? come on....
---
How are you getting 11? 
---
..Am I taking some kind of bait right now? I only get 8 script from him and all of them...
---
Enclave.
---
Nope, I got it 2 weeks ago with one of my characters and am in the process of collecting the BOS paints with a second one (I am about half way there)
---
how do you establish what is apparently a fallout saturday morning cartoon? i mean stop nitpicking.
---
Is it rare and how much is it worth
---
Oof, that post history...  someone is making some nose-based firewood somewhere here...
---
Pint-sized slasher is too old to play with knives.  He needs a man/mutie-sized weapon.
---
I am a voracious builder. Its what I truly live for in this game. I know my budget :) I have a mod installed that tells me to the number exactly how much budget I have used and what I have left. It sets the max budget at 10,000 units. I am at 9999 units built. I tamed a Deathclaw, today, and am still at 9999 units. They don't take up any (measurable) budget. If they did I would not have been able to tame it. eta typos and bs
---
But sadly, FO76 does not have sliders for genitals like Cyberpunk 2077 does... 
---
(Santa must have gotten my letter and really came through for me this year)
---
I was gonna buy the game if that counts and you can wait till tmr after work.  Reddrider216
---
Who designs these things?
---
Why do they still have a job?
---
I would be happy to make you a set of power armour, and give you some ammo and melee weapons to play with. Just send me a  direct message with your psn.
---
Before the Boss event, I had well over 100k.  I scrap everything.
---
Only the initiate paint is legacy for the BoS power armor paints
---
They can't pay out the whole thing in the first week.
---
Come on now.
---
Just rng man. You gotta pray harder to rngesus
---
It would have been real nice if it was just like the ammo vending machines at train stations. Just dump all ammo, it gives us tokens instead of caps for everything we dump in. Can use at train stations and camps. 
---
Would actually give a purpose to those machines.
---
Like they did in Dunwich borers kind of?
---
While I'm not a huge Mothman fan, I was super disappointed with the way they added them in Wastelanders. Not one quest.
---
At least it's a fun rp item
---
A pristine Nuka Cola paint for my T-51 is all I want since I started playing this game 1.5 year ago. I'm not asking too much and I'm willing to pay for it with my hard earned Atoms...
---
Power armour glitch it fixes itself or happens when transitioning from in power armour to out of it
---
I gave away a lot of stuff to a player level 11 I believe. Freed up maybe 200 lbs. We couldn't converse in voice chat so I did what I could.  
---
My plan is to reduce even further to help newbs out with some armor, a good weapon, etc. Problem is gear in the world levels more often. A place I normally get a limited level Sniper Rifle became 50 for me.
---
If you place a camp close to a workshop you own and someone tries to take it over they can directly attack your camp.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat; any armor or weapons that are worth anything are on me being actively used or are for sale in my machines. I might have a few apparel items or plans stashed that I might now consider carrying with me, but nothing worth 10K+ or even $5K+ caps.
---
Radiation Rumble has gotten even worse since people stopped showing up to it
---
Bruh its still so good for xp.. Come back
---
Stop body shaming people.
---
as long as you're staying in the zone, you're contributing to the team
---
You are not a fan? May I tell you about my savior, the magical and mighty Mothman? I have some literature you can read!
---
I feel (just a feeling) explosives are penetrating armor. It's hard to say, since this game is full of weird mechanics (like magic shotguns and reduced damage by blocking, or heavy fast weapons killing the queen in five seconds).
---
Winning! Heaps goof photo
---
For the most part that is visual only. If you look at your specials tab, you'll see you aren't actually losing -4 STR from 1 mutation even if the main effects tab says so. Un-slotting and re-slotting Class Freak will show you with the same special scores, just updates the effects tab correctly to say -1 STR for example.
---
There was no mask in the article mentioning the outfit. So I'm not convinced one ever existed. Some flunky just thought one existed and put an entry in the shop. Just because a CM said they'd pass it along doesn't mean anything will happen if it never existed in the first place.
---
dude had some bad Thai food, it‚Äôll pass
---
Interesting. I never knew this. I will now have to sell my stock for 30K.
---
Rolled my 1st explosive fixer..works good but the 1st perk is suppressor...oddly it been working well for me
---
I try to pop a radshield once the fight ends
---
There should also be a cooking fire imo, for any last minute buffs
---
Can animals inside interiors be tamed or do they have to be out in the open? And can animals with crowns be tamed?
---
I haven't gotten anything
---
Still better then my 3 war glave plans
---
I am. 20 is fine.
---
Joining a team doesn't automatically bring you to the event. You still need to choose it from the map the same way as you would solo.
---
I had to laugh when I logged on the other week and saw that someone had nuked Sutton. Guess they really dislike the Overseer.
---
Dude, daily op the other day was robots with a cryo effect, shit sucked. Spent 15 minutes on the final boss hiding behind boxes and popping up to shoot between giant laser face and cryo bullets. Couldnt use my big fuckin sledge to smash his health down.
---
Were you there from the beginning? I got mine when I joined late and oddly enough I died right at the end also..very surprised when I checked my inventory to see those scout masks
---
That reminds me, I gotta go back to playing Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey......  now THAT game could creep up a man's skirt like nobody's business....
---
There‚Äôs a subreddit called fallout76 settlements or something. Their pretty active to help people with camps.
---
Are you talking about Todd?
---
you are why we cant have nice things in fallout.
---
Remember when selling an item to the vendor bots you found the plans to make in the wild was considered an exploit? I'm looking at you early game hats.
---
If i fall behind again due to being away for work I can always catch up with cash. Nice to know where its at. Im assuming it updates each day or week or is it manually updated?.
---
Good job. I will be following this one again this season. Keep up the good work.
---
FEV at its finest
---
Mothman. 
---
I have other opinions about Todd.
---
I was wondering when you deposite technical data does it matter if its one or 5five or twenty , is it all the same ? All rng? Best I've gotten out of it was the bomber jacket twice and a scientist outfit.
---
Yeah I'm in with them
---
Wait. There is a giant airship?
---
I can't tell if /s or not....
---
I don't even know what the mask is supposed to look like
---
I'm experiencing this for at least the past 3 or 4 months, to be honest, also on Xbox. The reload bug and the rubberbanding on enemies' health kind of pushed me away from this game. Other thing extremely tilting is to die because I'm spamming the D-Pad to inject a Stimpak and nothing happens because of the lag.
---
Serious question: have you bought all the plans from Reg?? And you dont want lunchboxes?
---
They should either get rid of duplicates (so you get something new every time ...or nothing at all), or keep the duplicates but make the reward chance 100% at Elder.
---
Having it so you have to fight RNG just to get a reward in the first place, and then fight against RNG *again* to try and get something you don't already have, is just shitty design. You're effectively rolling two dice and hoping to get the same number on both.
---
If your vendor is up i will try nuking in a diferent direction. But i need a place to fast travel to. Ive had complaints that I nuke players often which wouldn't happen if incould see your camp.
---
Can you enlighten me on the value of urban scout. I‚Äôve been sitting on one for the longest. Think I grabbed it within the first few weeks or months of release and just had it for the looks and gas mask.
---
Wastelanders added NPC's. There are a few interesting characters, but the human NPC list is still incredibly small. 
---
A casual player won't even notice PVP at all unless they queue for the Battle Royale game mode Nuclear Winter. In the adventure world some people have created player trap CAMPS, but again you will only run across them when actively searching for player made sales &amp; deals. Pretty much end game content.
---
You can enable "pacifist mode" in the options, which means you won't accidently enable unwanted PVP by having a stray bullet pierce somebody. Players can no longer destroy CAMPS unless PVP has been engaged.
---
Edit: Workshops &amp; Whitesprings are the most frequented PVP areas. The game clearly marks the workshops, if you want to claim one don't stick around too long or somebody may come along. Whitesprings is the most popular location in the game everybody migrates to for trading. It's not too common but I've seen big groups of 12+ players dueling it out there.
---
Feel free to add me! PSN: Avalynch
---
the daily ops punishes solo play with the uplinks
---
It's rough work but it's honest work.
---
The camera didn‚Äôt help in that vanishing Sentry Bot next to the NAR yards.. it is a shame when the lower level players miss out on a decent 1-star
---
Neither could I.
---
I don't wanna have to kill them all the time... I need a peace treaty.
---
Just let me have access to the Lucky Hole mine you crack heads and I won't have to keep shooting you.
---
I can hope, at least. I just want to see the faction actually do their goal of rebuilding (and controlling) America for once instead of committing genocide.
---
Thank You! i had some insomnia, and added how many super mutants you have to kill to finish the race.
---
Interiors don't have events. You can only tame animal spawns at the scene event locations on the map provided in the OP. It's random.
---
I just eat melons
---
The Prydwen? How the BoS arrives in Boston?
---
I‚Äôm not against power armour. In fallout 4 it‚Äôs all I used end game. What I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs loud (no sneak), you lose all legendary effects, carry weight isn‚Äôt good, damage resistance is ok at best, it‚Äôs slow. I could go on. If you use heavy guns or are in a nuke zone, use it. Otherwise there are much better options......
---
God bless you, bro!

Guerilla/Gunslinger: Move to Perception. Pistols perks should be in Perception Rather than agility. A lot of great perks that are essential for builds are found in agility. 9 slots for pistol damage in the same tree just hurts its performance overall.
---
6 completions. Mostly solo, 3 basic, 2 paladins and an elder with a team. 0 rare rewards.
---
I had about 30+ of them but since the update I've been going through them like crazy.   I just checked I'm down to 4.  I need them!!!
---
Thank you!.
---
It really doesnt need maintanance, usually i updated if bethesda adds more rules/content/events or if i notice there is an error in a formula, or if a new functions comes to my mind.  
---
Right now i just added a tool that tells you how many supermutants you would have to kill to finish the race. 
---
Insmonio just puts me on creative mode.
---
Everyone is complaining about this since the ammo converter was release and even after it was reworked. They don't realize how much is important in this game, we need a new UI, like the one vendors have. I hope they are working on it.
---
The uniforms outside of power armor looked like wetsuit ready to go swimming with dolphins lol
---
missile launchers/fat mans do far too little damage for the weight of the weapon and the weight of the ammo
---
I don‚Äôt bother with bullet shield but ricochet, dodgy, action boy/girl and a kinetic dynamo and I rarely lose any health.
---
reddit moment
---
My wife and I have run OPS 2-3 times a day since they started and the only thing I have received is the BOS mask. My wife has received 4 vault 94 stash box plans, 1 war glaive plan, 1 reactor plan, and the BOS mask. We have only run them together so while I've received one rare item shes received all that... very frustrating. At least she gave me one of the stash box plans lol.
---
Good to know
---
I'll give you that. Under armor was pretty weak, but it makes sense why they would be wearing it. Easy to slip in and out of your PA.
---
Do you get that from the Vault 79 raid? If so, is it a straight up outfit or can it be used as under armor? I tried taking a screenshot in game, but couldnt find a way to embed the picture of under armor Ive seen around the Settlers main community. Thanks!
---
At the Random Encounters map locations only. None are inside.
---
No space at all :)
---
Love it!!
---
It's by Point Pleasant. I tamed him in the Savage Divide. He'll scale if I move :)
---
I guess my unpopular opinion is that I like her voice and hope she's alive and available as an NPC later in the game.
---
I'm always hoping someone knows where to go cause I get lost constantly lol
---
honestly man we can always do it another time. just add me! :)
---
Arent we in the fo76 subreddit. We ain't anywhere near Boston.
---
Looks like you successfully made friends with it...here I was thinking Rose was making stuff up.
---
I think so
---
Do you get this from completing the daily ops under the fastest time?
---
Me either, done them each day solo elders/paladins and have got nothing rare.
---

OP post dude....
---
Me (202) and my girl (112) got in-game married. She regularly make sure I'm wearing my ring üòÇ
---
Health is not a problem as I am a full health vampire build, I  just meant the damage your armour takes, since I  started using bullet shield, I really don't have to repair my steel skin very often. Not sure if the perk is why or just my luck.
---
Me but with Fog Crawlers
---
Video proof?
---
No idea but I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had to repair my t65.
---
Daily ops are just an attempt to thin our bloodthirsty numbers before the BoS arrives.
---
Predictions: BoS are going to find the alien threat at the observatory and are gonna get murdered by aliens and the enclave and secret service stay silent till last minute to drive the aliens away. (Maybe requesting us to nuke the alien ships?)
---
Which is why the BoS in capital wastland arnt related and the BoS in WV and have only found little trace of abduction and aliens in WV. In theory, the WV chapter have little significant because they get completely wiped by a bigger threat (twice lmao) and the only thing that‚Äôs best at covering it‚Äôs track is aliens itself. This would explain why the alien references are appearing over the map. And the little acknowledgement of aliens form the BoS in Fo3
---
Art
---
It‚Äôs a lot of fun but I don‚Äôt like going in solo. With the tight corridors my build isn‚Äôt ideal for it
---
BETA been playing almost daily for almost 2 years.
---
I tamed a high level deathclaw from south mountain lookout about a year ago. It randomly tore up my camp so i got rid of it. But used the above guide to get a snally today by freddies house of fear.
---
Back when it was first released, I knew about this event before I started the quest line. What I didn‚Äôt expect is the quest ended by starting this event. 
---
Puts in keycard. **Encryptid has started**. I just sat there in horror and kept muttered oh shit to myself.
---
Awesome! Glad to hear it helped!
---
I'm a mercenary. Limiting your clients to nice people doesn't pay the bills.
---
Went and read it again. Guess i skipped a line.
---
Nomen est omen...
---
When you max rep the rep rewards become extra scrip instead.
---
So you can shoot at the ground under your feet and nothing to worry about? That‚Äôs great. What about legendary weapons with explosive bullets?
---
Overseer Caches are always loaded with food and supplies. There‚Äôs like 20-30 of em all over the map.
---
That‚Äôs how the game fits you into a PA frame. But when players exit it sometimes the system glitched and doesn‚Äôt remove the deformation and you turn into slender men.
---
No, it‚Äôs basically right on the edge of The Mire (northeast). Once you approach the location, your map automatically updates and you discover it. If you want to access it: Just enter the cave, walk up to the control panel, press on it, and boom ‚Äî the vault door opens!
---
The problem is there‚Äôs no groundbreaking pvp in NW, it‚Äôs 95% luck and 5% skill, the ‚Äòskill‚Äô is often just keep doing bunny hop and shoot at the ground.
---
I hope that if they ever attempt another multiplayer Fallout game factions &amp; race can be chosen from very early quests and hopefully the CAMP mechanics, legendary effects, perks, &amp; mutations will be completely revamped. The current mechanics seem outdated, and unbalanced.
---
All legendary effects should have viability, there should not be a monopoly on a select few leaving the others in the dust because they can't compete.
---
Legendary weapons with explosive bullets still kill you. Very fast.
---
Hence why i used sarcasm. Shouldve used quotation marks
---
Daily ops gives you a better chance and a rare reward once a day by completing it under 8 minute. 
---
I was lucky enough to get both pieces on two separate characters and even more lucky enough that Bethesda lets you drop the pieces. As I can tell there is no plans for them (to prevent dups perhaps)
---
Did you use a Fortnite action figure as the base? Is that Jonesy?
---
  [/u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/)  can u please tell us what's going on with the camp skin? even though I am afraid that you will tell me to rebuild again to get rid of it....my beautiful Haunted house in the forest is haunted by this skin :)
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt realize it takes up the chest piece mod! I just bought it and the dense mod but I was waiting for a good roll to mod
---
Yea i got it, it‚Äôs such a missed opportunity.
---
Not sure what the rare rewards are, but it's   barely a week old and I have already gotten duplicate plans.  And the RNG in this game is completely broken. A prime example of this is Radiation Rumble. You can fill the ore to 100 percent and keep all the settlers alive and get the exact same reward that you'd get had you done the bare minimum.
---
"It encourages you to keep playing," they say.
---
I say it does the opposite.  It makes you wonder why you bother, so you eventually give up and lose interest.
---
I have that on my vanguard main. It's incredible. But for bloodied build meta it's suboptimal
---
Make it PVP so we can put the mothf***kas down.
---
come out come out wherever you aRGHFKDHSGEBRUDBDNXJXCNDH
---
If you're on PS4 I can paint your t-51
---
Thank you! Is the location for end game grouping, or can it be explored solo with a mid leveled character just fine? Not looking specifically for spoilers of what's in there.
---
So I guess the camp skin causes problems with you‚Äôre camp it makes it so people can‚Äôt fast travel to it and you‚Äôre camp will appear grey and it also makes it so ally‚Äôs won‚Äôt walk around you‚Äôre camp they‚Äôll be standing far away and won‚Äôt move and the only way I could fix it was taking off that skin and then had the re place my camp thankfully it blue printed everything when I re placed my camp
---
Fixed it. *mecanik*
---
Honestly I have always been unlucky with this game, when the Christmas event came I never got anything rare until someone dropped be a 100 duplicated presents, on Halloween I didn't get anything rare, I still haven't gotten anything rare from colossal problem, and nothing from the daily ops
---
i think there is no legacy paints for t-60 rn, you can get them all from technical data quests
---
Man, imagine an encounter where a torn fur suit Maniac is beating tf out of a dead npc (beating a dead horse) and he makes references  quoting the terrible things some redditers posted on here about the game when it was in its bad state  
---
 
---
Similar the the OG death fallout encounter and the devs killing him lmao. That would be sick ahahahaa ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
What do you want to build a sympto matic? paddyb29 (PS4)
---
You got 80% change at elder.
---
If you get nothing you have to try the next day.
---
So far after 6 days I got 6/6 and my gf and our friend got 5/6.
---
Its almost impossible you got 0 rare out of 6 days.
---
I've only bought the secret service chest and jetpack. I'm quite happy with my legendary heavy combat armor on my limbs and i don't care about power armor.
---
Anything i'm really missing out on?
---
my fault, seems that it still damage you without fireproof, in both gauss shotty and explosive weapon.
---
But Rank3 fireproof entirely eliminate all damage and cripple eddect though, before patch I remember it still hurt you a bit.
---
I just want the flamer to get fixed. I want to make my next character main the flamer but it's glitchy and I hear they break fast.
---
Yeah balance is fairly hard but ESO pulls it off pretty well.  Even the weaker builds are still viable. I use technically the weakest class and can solo most the content.
---
I'm never really set on being the best though. Fun is equally important as viability for me.
---
The build I'm going with in FO76 will be good because I started towards commando before I even knew what was good or not. Rifleman/Gunslinger is usually my go to for first play throughs in Fallout games, but I just finished FO:NV with that build a few days before I started this game. So I wanted something different.
---
Is it 2*? It's not top tier, but not scrip.
---
https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=ultragatling&amp;effects=B/FFR
---
Thanks for that, my assumption is that a low population of AU/NZ players is directing me to Singapore as the ms feels roughly 150
---
I've been playing since Thursday so not all 6 days but so far have yet to get anything
---
I think the genitals were better in fallout New Vegas. That was a hung person.
---
All I want is the vault stash box. Guess nothing is better than legendary rolling pins and broadsiders. üòÄ
---
I am glad that you fixed it. My camp took me 6 hours to build, and I am not in the mood now to rebuild it (and I don't trust that blueprint it will help me) so I guess I will live with the bug for a while ...
---
It has to be a random event animal?
---
Yes. The map linked in the body of the post will tell you where to go!
---
Yeah I completely understand that hopefully Bethesda just fixes it and you won‚Äôt have to rebuild anything especially with how much time you put into you‚Äôre camp
---
All depends. I explored it just fine solo. Since One Wasteland, you should be able to go solo is you‚Äôre mid level. There are some decently strong enemies though. Make sure you bring some stimpaks just in case! üôÇ
---
Question - if I log off while it‚Äôs running, what happens?
---
I agree. And when you talk to the raiders they often explain they've got sick people too.
---
It can take up to a minute or so and then they appear. I usually watch for the little flies that show up.
---
It will continue it's run when you log back on OR if it was close enough it will just be there! However....on some occasions, if its not a hearty pet, it may get killed on its journey. I've only ever lost one pet, and I chalk it up to luck and Bethesda lol
---
Tbh man YES. You‚Äôre missing a huge gold sink and potential grind to get much better armor ‚Äî since you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt like PA, Secret Service armor is the BEST ARMOR IN GAME!! Whatever your current legendary combat armor is, you can get getter SS armor ‚Äî just gotta grind out legendary modules to get it. You have the gold to buy all the SS limbs and chest and buttressed mods and deep pockets and such. I too had non-SS gear I didnt want to part with till I learned buttressed SS has the highest non-PA DR in game...
---
Half assed? Lol, they intentionally made it a time wasting piece of shite. Didn't they already revise it once and this is what we get? Yeah, they must like our sweet asses because they are fucking us.
---
Alright, that means I can sleep and hope my mole rat makes it‚Äôs journey. Thank you!
---
Since you have to roll alot; I carry the weightless rolls with different chest mods and switch when needed.
---
Yes, rest easy, Valiant Beastmaster!
---
[I made a post earlier on Taming.](https://redd.it/iwnmss) Apparently level does NOT matter....a level 11 tamed a level 21 Deathclaw. Go find your pet and conquer taming!
---
you're not getting the prompt but you are most likely getting the multiplier.
---
thing is, the 'multiplier' is now additive as well. covert operative for example added a whopping 37 damage to my legacy flamer.
---
lol that‚Äôs what I thought too
---
thank you very muchüôè
---
My pleasure! Good luck!
---
Oh i see. I have FP rank 2 and still kill myself easily when those ghouls and animals get too close too fast. Maybe 3 is a must.
---
Maybe some more 
---
atom points please
---
You're correct, it's limitation of the terminal interface... But... I don't know why they couldn't instance a vendor interface after doing the terminal entry.... We already know it can work with different currencies thanks to Mumbles...
---
Round ammo points down to the nearest whole number, so there might be a little loss of points... But you're already losing "value" so what's a point or two of difference if people don't hate it...
---
Before you get onto the terminal, take a pic of what ammo you‚Äôre carrying with you (like with your phone), on the pipboy, and don‚Äôt let the ammo build up in your box. Idk I like it.
---
Could be doing that depending on time of day. Or could be how close you are to the Sydney server that is effecting you.
---
So if I wanted a wolf I‚Äôll likely never get one then?
---
do you have any good spots? at the moment im just going to the random spawn at the crashed ship in the lake at the top right of the map
---
Thank you, i hope so too.
---
A wolf id DEFINTELY a tamable creature! I have seem them MANY times!
---
Using hacked bs is basically a public announcement ‚Äòi suck so bad but I really want to kill some shit‚Äô
---
Once tamed do you have to keep any of those crappy perk cards attached?
---
And also let us drop them in stacks, not one at a time.
---
South Mountain Lookout, Cranberry Glade, Berkeley Springs Station, Big B's Rest Stop (there's 2 right there)!
---
Heck no. I have a build for taming and I swap right back!
---
There is no reason to do them though. You also need not apply if you're stealth. 
---
Great content. 10/10, would play skyrim on my fridge again.
---
Yeah, it was a bit of a learning curve when I got my first explosive gatling plasma. ü§£üôà
---
Plus 70 ammo converter points...
---
This. Everything was nerfed a ton, so the little additional damage from explosive effect suddenly seems significant.
---
I am Level 400 plus. Level 6 on charisma. used both whisperer and animal friend at max points. I can't tame both Level 100 deathclaw, nor a mirlurk queen nor a level 60 milurk king or just a level 60 milurk... Pacifying appears once in a while for me. Using a LMG to try to tame them...
---
Oh yea i hardly ever use it because every time I did I turn myself into goo splash within seconds lol
---
Always wanted this for all the games.
---
last time I tried daily ops we got halfway through objectives and I got booted from the team. (was consistently on objectives and killing/surviving while my teammate kept getting killed, was booted so his friend could join.) fuck daily ops.
---
Nuke it, for the enclave!
---
I don't believe you've ever played on the PTS. They wouldn't have listened, it wouldn't have been fixed.
---
Initiate paint is legacy, unless something has changed?
---
That happened to me a lot last weekend
---
&gt;don‚Äôt fight enemies between objectives just sprint by them to the next objective
---
No no no, you have to kill every enemy, the community says so. That's why they disabled stealth in the ops.
---
Lol. I do still need to track down all the numbered holotapes.
---
You know you can buy Gold Bullions in caps, right?
---
Be cool of they took all the loot from your kills and gave it to you at the end with the rest of your rewards. No meat piles or bodies using memory. Just a random thought.
---
Fuck the overseer. All my homies hate the overseer.
---
I'll be keen to see what other people say here.... I think it's bullshit and doesn't work as I notice hardly any difference.
---
I need to do some number tracking but imo there's nothing 'legendary' about it.
---
Scorchbeasts are extreme bullet sponges now just like everything else in the game.They decided to add this to drain playing time and resources rather than add in meaningful content.
---
I've learned to use it from far away, like when I'm on a roof and the enemy is on the ground. When I go in a building I switch to my non explosive weapon. Took a few deaths to work it out. ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Top left?
---
Agreed
---
oh yes, I forgot about this paint, so yea, only initiate paint then
---
The perk card is supposed to pop up when it activates correct? If so Its no popping up lol
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
Go launch a nuke yourself, if you do it right, others will join you for the event.
---
From my point of view is not losing money, keep a private server has several costs. Indeed, like other people wrote, private has benefits but not for all! Most people use it but not the totality.
---
I don‚Äôt think any of the legendary perks have pop up icons, but I‚Äôve only got a couple of them so I can‚Äôt confirm it. Might be worth watching Angry Turtle‚Äôs perk testing series on YouTube to confirm it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the perk works though, there‚Äôs a split second lag between it occurring and numbers changing due to server lag IIRC. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve noticed the numbers change with my stealth commando
---
we need this
---
*Nice*
---
I‚Äôm scared
---
Maybe when enough people have unlocked it in game and the complaints start swelling.
---
Atm, I'd say it's one of the least used armor sets in use.
---
There are plenty of great helpful players, but there is always bad with the good. Last night i had a level 45~ player drop a bunch of broken weapons and armor infront of me and did the love heart sign, i picked up the items repaired and modded them then returned them to him. He then dropped a single .308 .50 and a 25mm grenade, i then built him a decent amount of each of those ammo types and he went on his way. The good players do exist :D we have to outweigh the bad guys.
---
Also, I love that you dont need a bloodied comando build to be useful, you just need to stay close. So even if you don't do a lot of damage, you can still be useful.
---
Where is your camp ? I even saw a low levels camp in the forest getting trashed  by level 50 blood eagles today. Shits got weird.
---
I believe you can drop/destroy them in stacks as long as you have at least...5 was it?
---
Not off to a good start on the mission then. 
---
Maybe unlock some real world liquid courage.
---
Why would you in the first place? There is no incentive to, besides farming screws.
---
Does it? I swear it asks me each time if I want to destroy them, one by one. I'll pay closer attention.
---
I had a mild panic then, I just traded a couple of super rare plans for an initiate plan!
---
Agree but at the same time there are a few of us who've grinded out matching sets, I don't see why scout armor skins can't apply to Solar/Thorn Armor.
---
*laughs in one shotting enemies with super sledge*
---
why perk.. they should make that a feature. like on elderscroll online for example every corpse nearby stack in one loot window.
---
See point one, the reason is simply because not enough people have complained to where they even realize it's a problem that needs to be fixed. 
---
It took a real long time before fixers could apply skins and we don't even know if it was intentional or not since the naming mechanism is currently broken so when they fix that we might lose skins too.
---
Once per day, per character. So if you have 5 character adequately leveled(50 or higher), you can do it 5 times a day.
---
You're really not. Packed full of gutsys,  protections and there was a stealth assaultron in there last night.
---
Oh, so maybe i should focus less on sneak and more on crits?
---
Fuck alcohol i need crack
---
Is the quest active for you. I used to get it allocated to me and then I had to activate the quest in the tab separately
---
Same for Wham Bam, my trusty Super Sledge
---
Ok that makes sense.
---
One shot once you hit elder for the day. After that you can get common rewards (ammo, currency, legendaries, etc) but none of the special ones (plans and outfit pieces).
---
Yes shooting from a higher place is the only viable way to take advantage of this weapon. It‚Äôs perfect for crowd control in boss fights. I always carry one to SBQ. But lately since the queen doesn‚Äôt land much when there‚Äôs people on top of buildings, I stay on the ground most of the time and don‚Äôt have much chance to use it üò≠
---
Does it? Mine defs doesn't appear. Sounds kinda annoying though... Not sure if it's meant to appear.
---
I still almost regret taking it. For one out of six (I only run one toon) choices I'll ever get, it's underwhelming in contrast to the extra perk options in Legendary SPECIAL. 
---
I plan on making Ammo Factory for my next at L200.
---
I love the update but I secretly hope we see some buffing, even if it's a fraction of the scale down we just took. Especially with respect to stealth hits.
---
I feel Beth missed the ball with what a stealth sniper round is.... You're hitting a vulnerable, idle target not prepared for combat arguably in the skull which, concussions aside, would understandably kill someone instantly. With a helmet on, you're still not going to get up quickly.
---
Yet here I am with my 'Instigating' rifle barely doing shit with a headshot in full 'Hidden', not to mention my alleged second shot ostensibly being +40% stronger than a normal round yet doing fuck all damage.
---
Or maby not giving out 5 nuke key cards for free
---
Incorrect. If the gattling plasma is non explosive and you put a splitter on it it shoots fog
---
I get staggered in air, is this also a terrain issue?
---
Hallowed be thy name, praise our savior! He is light, he is night, he is everything we delight!
---
That's a good point actually with the Fixer. Well as I said no rush, just something to go in the pipeline. üëç
---
The whitesprings will eat all your ammo.
---
For now try to stay closer to home. I do not reccomend watoga, Instead go scavenging at morgantown, the high school has lots to loot.
---
Are you on ps4 I'd be happy to make you some ammo. I remember how hard this game was for me when I was low level, and that was before all this one wasteland nonsense
---
Well the broke the game so this is what people have to deal with now.
---
Why only 6, i thought it would be 1 per special so if you wanted you could increase all your special bonuses. Tho when i got all 6 on and i hover over a perk i don't have it shows a perk slot with a lock icon.
---
This, also I‚Äôve been noticing less SBQ as well. Makes me sad since I recently got the CSA and have rad protection, I did my first event three days ago and have a HUGE hankering for more!
---
It rolls three times at once on Elder.
---
Hence you can get double drops of the same shit.
---
Edit: For example I got two Caged Lights plans on the same run and Paladin and Elder proc'd the loot.
---
It's definitely meant to appear but I feel like it works I get from a damage increase with my pipe revolver from 500+ damage to 600 in the next shot after so I think it's definitely working
---
Hard drugs and nuclear weapons!
---
what could possibly go wrong?
---
Don't claim workshops. That's a invitation for pvp
---
I got 6 cards up to rank 3 as a lvl 329, but yeah if i focused on maxing out then i'd probably have 2 or 3 cards at max rank. I remembering having 900ish coins
---
They do survival shortcut and brawling chemist both pop up when activated
---
Pretty sure you can as long as you have a large enough stack of them but I think a lot of people usually try to get rid of them as soon as they get any though. I could probably run a few Ops tomorrow and test it afterwards just to be sure.
---
I‚Äôve just woken up and this has confused me. You only get one chance at the rare drop and that‚Äôs when you hit elder? After that you get no chance at the drop?
---
Out of curiosity, why stay by the relay?
---
kinda. it's a good idea, yes. crits are a lot more useful now than before.
---
problem is, this patch introduced some weird lag relating to how (and when) damage registers, so a lot of the time your crit bar won't fill properly.
---
for example, I have a crit build that has a 1:1 cycle- in theory. but in practice, even with a semi auto, I get two crits followed by 3-4 regular shots before the bar finally wakes up and refills.
---
I want to meet the guy that signed off on that design. Like, what the fuck were they thinking? It looks god awful. Theres an entire universe here of existing armor that looks much better, as well as the potential for all kinds of great armor that would harken to the post appcalyptic environment.
---
Nope. Let's slap some fern leaves on some tupperware.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen 20 in that corner before it‚Äôs a bit weird
---
Enraged or Glowing Fog Crawlers all the way.
---
I've gotten multiple rewards from doing it 3 separate times though and I assume elder could only give you the one?
---
I am a heavy weapons build. I use the flamer a lot. I have 140k round of flamer fuel. I have 40k rounds of 5mm, and just traded away 30k of it lol. Ammo is a non issue
---
In all seriousness though, it's not dismissing your initial request. 
---
I'm helping point you in the direction of getting what you want whenever you want on your own without needing to rely on others. 
---
Running silo is intimidating the first few times but eventually it's second nature and you can zoom through it pretty quickly and that puts all the power in your hands. 
---
Want to go kill a queen? Do it whenever you want. Want to kill Earle? You got it. Just need some flux? Well, Fuck morgantown.
---
The world is your irradiated oyster.
---
what the fuck lol
---
You're getting the generic trash, but the actual plans etc come once with each rank, per day.
---
Doing Elder on your first attempt will roll all three chances at the same time, resulting in multiple plans at once if you're lucky.
---
Theres no difference running it three times getting each rank with respect to the actual loot.
---
I understand how these things may be useful to some new players, but it would be amazing if the game could detect that I have a 350+ char in my account..and adjust accordingly.
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
Ok that makes more sense! Thank you! Would you recommend doing elder first for the 80% rare chance? Or just doing all 3?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iupqbw/psa_this_is_how_daily_ops_rewards_work/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I will never look at ward the same.
---
You can get a rare drop at any of the tiers, once per day. Higher chance at higher tier. If you hit elder on your first run, you can get more than one rare drop because it rolls 3 separate times, one for each tier. It's late for me so probably shouldn't be attempting to explain this haha
---
[Sneal](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n5sVZ0QBRmM/hqdefault.jpg) attack for 2x damage
---
But you can get the rare at any tier on any attempt? Not just elder?
---
If you run bloodied heavys it's a great gun. I run ult gat lasers a lot
---
I do Elder first up if possible as by God you'd churn through ammo etc.
---
Unless you want to grab all the extra Stims and junk that comes along too.
---
*my worst nightmare*
---
I read that I just don't understand if the 1 chance at a rare a day means the first run or the first time you get elder?
---
Oh I use it as my main weapon and it's brilliant! Works in some daily ops, like the Valley Galleria and in parts of Vault 94.  I love blowing up the cars at the Red Rocket Mega Stop when I do the daily Waste Not (which is where I got my traveling leather coat as a reward as well!) and at Sugar Grove parking lot.  Just some trial and error with kiting the enemies and picking them off from far enough away to not get splash damage.
---
Just started using junkies, definitely need better weapons for it, but in all honesty bro I‚Äôll just build it for you.
---
The first chance you unlock the tier. So if you unlock elder that's the only chance you get. It rolls all 3 tiers chances.
---
Ahh so must need the buttressed mods. To me it didn‚Äôt look like SS armor was really any better than heavy combat armor, so I just got the chest piece and that was it. I‚Äôll check it out thanks!
---
I‚Äôve got the under armor with mods too already.
---
And if you unlock the others say, does that count as your chance at a rare reward?
---
Works for the critters but the bot parts vanish..
---
Yes, on unlocking each tier. Once each tier is unlocked you cant keep trying to roll on that character until Dailies reset. I hope I am explaining this alright lol
---
Ok. If you can't manage to pull elder first go, does that mean you've used up your one chance to get the rare item?
---
/r/kevduit to the rescue?
---
Yes, but the chances are slim.
---
I believe it can be any tier. There have been times where I hit elder on my first run and got 2 plans, another where I got paladin and elder separate times but got plans each time.
---
Bring back the Children of Atom!
---
Just imagine how happy they would be watching as vault dwellers launched their nukes left and right. It would be like a literal paradise on Earth!
---
üòÇü§£Tell me about it, best description I've heard someone describe it buy lmao. I love the bonus you get from solar. I now have a matching set to, but my god it look awful and I'm one of those that doesn't wear clothing over armor, well now I do to hid it but apart from that I never do.
---
Elder gives you all three rolls. If you get elder first try you get your three rolls for the day. If you get paladin first try you get two rolls, then you can get elder on your next try for your final roll.
---
They don't overwrite each other. If you get elder, you get paladin and initiate as separate rolls all at once.
---
I swear this topic is beat dead at this point.
---
Dude. Each tier has 1 chance. If your first run is elder you've completed all 3 tiers. And you have used all 3 chances for the day.
---
Anyone else get dicked on the rare reward? Unfortunately my first run was 8 mins 35 secs, but second run unlocked elder and nada zip. Is it only on first try?
---
Pshhh yea this will never happen we cant even scrap legendary perk cards we dont want, I‚Äôm fine with getting 75% of the coins back whatever but damn let me scrap some shit.
---
Buttressed UNY SS armor has been a lifesaver for XP for me!
---
I believe so, characters clip on invisible entities and they‚Äôre not necessarily tied specifically to the floor. I‚Äôve had the same issue where I‚Äôll be jumping along and randomly hit some invisible object and become staggered midair. Doesn‚Äôt really do anything other than slow ya down though
---
Ohhh ok thank you. Sorry I feel like a bunch of people have not explained it well enough so it makes it difficult. I thought if you screwed up your first run you automatically wouldn't get the elder roll of the 80% chance.
---
My guy. It makes it charge/go up faster. Killing doesnt mean shit if it take the team 15min on the relays alone.
---
Edit: Steps: 
---
1) Repair
---
2)run
---
3) defend and stay by the relay (watch the top right)
---
4) run
---
5) defend and stay by relay
---
6) run
---
7)NOW kill as quick as you can
---
8)That sweet loot
---
Yeah, that bonus is nice. Thats the only saving grace, that you can hide it with an outfit. Its just a shame that you have to. It could've been so much better.
---
From what everyone is explaining to me it seems like there are separate rolls for each tier. But there was a day i hit elder first go and nothing so it definitely could just be bad luck for the day.
---
That's a  good idea
---
I think they've cocked up what odds they assign to each rank.
---
I did 4 Elder and got nothing, next day deliberately took longer then 8 mins and I got the sympto plan, same story I have heard from others.
---
Only we know what the BoS were like before Fallout 1 because we have both Fallout 1 and 76's tapes from Maxson. Why do you think they'd be like the out of character fascists from Fallout 4 and not the BoS that we already know about from the time period? 
---
The original BoS were still letting wastelanders join their ranks up until the late 2130s (after the original Maxson died of cancer) and up until the 2140s were still fighting raider gangs. The whole tipping point in Fallout 1 with them is that you can either help them return to the path they started on or help them head down the path that the Eastern BoS took in 4. There is no reason, within the lore, that they would act like they did in Fallout 4, they're 180 odd years and 3,000 miles early for that.
---
My explosive handmade breaks like eighteen times a day
---
There are like never any enemies in there for me.
---
No, my GT is BlackClock69#660.
---
Ohhh ok thank you. Sorry I thought if you got over 8 minutes first go you were screwed. I've seen a lot of people saying that your first go is your only chance at your rare reward. Very few people explain this well.
---
If I remember correctly,  the old version at least would only give you options for what ammo you had. Now I have to guess what ammo I have and if I have enough to exchange.  I preferred the old way when it comes to that.
---
what?
---
You think that‚Äôs bad, I‚Äôve already gotten 200 mutton pie recipes, I‚Äôve sold so many that there‚Äôs no one left that wants them
---
How do you accidentally drop an explosive Gatling plasma? I‚Äôm sorry but look at what the name says or rename it to something crazy so you never have the chance on dropping it.
---
Just rng. First run today, joined someone mid run, we finished like 11min, second try got a third and we got in 7 and I got the reactor plan. Yesterday had a 6min first try run got nothin.
---
Nature? Pretty sure mirelurk kings arent very *natural*.
---
Sounds like a permissions issue.
---
Pretty much par for the course with this update.
---
How?
---
Where do u play on?
---
Come on and join our convoy  
---
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way  
---
We gonna roll this walking convoy
---
As a random thought in case you are a new player - there is a water fountain located in white springs called the 'sulfur fountain' which cures diseases. Look up a youtube video on it and it will show you its location.
---
Ohhh I want this so bad
---
While I would definitely prefer repair kits, radaway isn‚Äôt completely useless - it‚Äôs an excellent source of caps if you don‚Äôt do a cap grind.
---
Sounds like you need to buff yourself
---
I didnt know of this tool. Cheers.
---
or a game where you get only 2 grenades so you don‚Äôt wanna waste them and then you never use them üòÇ
---
I feel like this is where they go to chill when nobody shoots them down. Just vibin
---
TY everyone for the advice!
---
Ran today's D.O. and got second tier, didn't get downed once. Decided wth and joined a public team to run it for Elder and we got it by 13 seconds, kudos to the duder who knew what he was doing (not a fan of the burrows myself, just followed him so we could get to the final).
---
Be running these a lot more now. If only there was a way to offset the freeze effect : / those Gutsy can still suck it /shrug
---
Now just running around non-stealth to get used to it. Generally my go-to Fallout build but it isn't much of an option for these D.O. reckon I'll get used to it.
---
If the nozzle is anything but standard any server hopping will kill range until you change out barrel. But thanks to that tip the other day I have been enjoying the nice range the past few days. A little hit to damage has been worth it.
---
I was very very surprised by the whole thing.    Other dudes started showing up and I was like hey.  Hey as you.   Then bam!
---
Once you get Elder that day you can't get the rare reward until the next day. Sometimes you don't get one because you only have a 5%/10%/80% chance for Initiate/Paladin/Elder respectively, which is really unfortunate. Though it's possible to get 3 rare rewards if you're just super lucky, because you get a separate roll for each tier. This is per-character, so if you have 5 characters you can get anywhere from 0 to 15 total rare rewards a day (still most likely 1 per character because of the roll chances).
---
so there is no pre-conditions like under-armor plan to get those staff and mod?
---
Eventually I got the plan from vendor with cheap price before get it from event  though,.what a joke.
---
Ah, I meant caps for perk coins. Smiley can send his kids to college thanks to my patronage of his wares!
---
It‚Äôs just luck, the only plans I‚Äôm missing is all the mods for the staff thingy, not the crook
---
What? Why are you comparing Maxson's BoS with Meg's raiders?
---
How do we get the devs attention ? Would very much like to know if it should pop up or not , i see no difference in my damage. not even i tap 1 shot first and wait 1 second before starting to shoot at the enemy
---
Yes.
---
It‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve seen with newcomers that come back after we clear out the major threat. And haven‚Äôt you noticed how the Brotherhood are assholes in general, with the exception of the Capital Wasteland division?
---
Just got off a server where someone nuked white springs.   It was so enjoyable. Lots and lots of glowingghouls to kill and if things got hairy I‚Äôd lead them to the bots for backup
---
I hung onto my Orbital Scan and Orbital Strike for *way too long* without using them, until I realized I'd been carrying around 2 units of weight for no reason. I didn't even bother using them and just scrapped them. And I'm someone who explodes cars just because it makes me smile :-)
---
Well, I also explode the cars as a distraction for anyone in the immediate area, but I don't even check if anyone's within an earshot. I only check if anyone's going to be within the blast radius.
---
I'm sure I'll get downvoted, but if you really enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2, I would recommend against playing this game. The main quest is pretty linear, character development is...different. There are only a handful of NPCs you have any real interaction with, and the interactions you do have are very limited in scope. The wit and humor from the originals is gone. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 minus choosing a faction, then this might be a game you could play.
---
This is just my humble opinion. If you have any curiosity I would say go for it, particularly if you already own it. If you're on the fence, get a good book and kill time with that until Cyberpunk comes out.
---
Oh, PvP has mostly been removed from the game except for a battle royale a la fortnite. The only PvP is if you try to take a workshop and someone else also tries to take the same workshop you can fight over it, or if you kill a wanted player, they can seek revenge on you. The vast majority of players have a setting called pacifist mode set so they won't fight.
---
There is a legendary perk bug that makes it so people can destroy your camp, but if you're starting from level 1, you won't need to worry about it.
---
Well, tbf that is explosive. Weren't explosive and two-shot made to do extra damage with One Wasteland?
---
Its not to glitchy, i never really use the Vaporization nozzel because i also run friendly fire and heal the team, also the flame passes through teammates and enemys so you can hit everything. If you run gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan to double repair it, it last a long while.
---
I dunno, I‚Äôm kind of clueless about a lot! I just love the game. I learn something new every day haha
---
Yeah, I loved taking mine to the prison with its low level ghouls and just shredding them for a lark.
---
So?
---
there is / was nothing to complain about re difficulty.
---
game is still stupid easy
---
Here is mine, one tap most things, i swop out sneak with dodgy for daily ops, does the charm

They aren't arseholes at all in Fallout 1 and 2, which are chronologically way closer to 76 than the ones you see in Fallout 4.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel#cite_note-Born2bBrotherhood-30
---
Worth reading the history of BoS here so you can get a contextual image of who they are in 2103. They don't start to become more secluded until the 2140s and remain fairly benevolent right up until the war with the NCR in the 2250s.
---
Just got finished doing that.   It was so enjoyable.   I murdered soooo many glowing ones.
---
More repair kits would be nice
---
I was gonna kill them anyway might as well get paid for it
---
Does Grahm sell anything exclusive?
---
Tank Killer, Concentrated Fire and all 3 Ranks of Commando all maxed out will make perfect use of your 15 PER. (Which you should aim for if you‚Äôre not there yet)
---
Yeah, afaik every instance of damage a weapon does now takes Durability. This was probably mainly to deter TSE weapons, but also screwed over scatter Plasma/Laser weapons, which were already the fastest to break.
---
Luckily for me, most of my decent weapons were neither Explosive or TS.
---
Their only use now is if you get the Resilient enemies in Daily Ops. You could have your team whittling them down with ranged weapons while you glide through them like butter when they have 1hp left.
---
Good lord how do you get that rifle??
---
I sadly love laser weapons a whole lot
---
Oh, don‚Äôt be a little bitch. Just because you an play Skyrim on your fancy new fridge DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN YOU NEED TO FLEX YOUR GOD DAMNED FRIDGE ON US PEASANTS!
---
I always thought it was really weird that they went through the trouble of making a chainsaw only to make it only available in low-level non-legendary forms.  If I were a game designer/programmer/computer artist/whatever, I'd be pissed if I went through the trouble of making a weapon only for it to be trash that nobody uses.   
---
Also, why can't I display it on a weapon rack?
---
Thank you so much!  You do great work.
---
I suggest using the legendary Recharge Perk for the robots and Blood Eagles. They can recharge your fusion core with energy attacks. Good for PvPing high grade PvPers too.
---
After the patch gauss shotgun headshots do not affect super mutants for some odd reason. They're also massively unreliable in vats after patch, frequently shots will miss 100% of the time unless you exit then re-enter vats. Combat and Pump Action shotguns massively out damage them as well, range is all they have going for them at the moment. Psychotats and ballistic bock don't seem to be working with gauss shotgun either as far as I can tell.
---
so looting could be a problem - and its a bug which was already fixed
---
Something must be off with pvp. They always seems to attack one of their alt characters first, and only then they can destroy everything...
---
Boo to whingey low levels who don‚Äôt like the idea of *endgame* content. Once you figure out your build you‚Äôll be able to solo endgame content like us high levels. In the meantime there‚Äôs plenty of events and that for you to do. Go and solo th- oh. You can‚Äôt because everything scales to your level... And the health curve gets insane around level 23. It just gets worse from here on in Private. But honestly, unless it‚Äôs the resilient crap, Daily Ops are easier and far more rewarding than current events. Stick close to the objectives and you will be fine running the ops with me, if you‚Äôre on Xbox. If you get downed while you‚Äôre in the uplink zone, don‚Äôt hit the suicide button.
---
Cat lady house?
---
does it work with wasteland whisperer too?
---
blaze it
---
Unfortunately that version isn't available in game yet. Instead there's a plastic version with decals called the screaming eagle.
---
And take 3 in glow sighted and swap for tank killer if your doing Earle or nuke zone or anywhere with predominantly glowing enemys
---
Ohhh. Cool, thanks for that!
---
I tend to play alone so I've resigned myself to never getting faster times.
---
I can think of two places I've found her in the Forest. On the shoreline starting behind Hillfolk Hotdogs, and at the little encampment across from Slocums Joe. 
---
When I was collecting bloodleaf on the shoreline, I saw her and Forager there, along with a bunch of treasure hunters and scavengers. 
---
Just run along the shoreline behind Hilfolk Hotdogs down past the junk node after the Sunshine Meadows Factory , then server hop and do it again.
---
It's only 'unreliable' when claiming workshops, otherwise it's 100%
---
Edit: 4 months, sorry for the necro lol
---
You're lucky !
---
Level 216 but when I hear the assaultron powering up I run away crying like a little girl
---
Oh really? Is the version your talking about a quest item or something you need to buy?
---
It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they nerf the Daily Ops so like the rest of the events it‚Äôs an ammo sink.
---
With the damage nerf it‚Äôs not fun anymore, yesterday I killed him together with a good heavy player, the other 2 guys didnt damage him at all, it was simply annoying. I dont want to blame the 2 rookies, they have no chance with the damage nerf but the heavy guy and me burned through too many bullets to make it worthwhile. I decided I wont do it again.
---
Edit: neither the heavy gunner,  nor me used magic weapons. With magic heavies its no problem, but using glitched weapons is something i simply dont like.
---
God yes pleaseeee
---
Uplink has the stealth, maybe future daily ops won't
---
Any ideas on how to fix?
---
ü§ô When it comes to the Ops; speed is key. Because most people are there for xp (low, but steady), ammo, or farming legendaries. The faster you get it done, the better everyone is. (Well, maybe not the ammo people, but you get the point)üëç
---
No. Once u reach elder rank all 3 are unlocked. If u get paladin first try you unlock the first two ranks. Still need to unlock paladin. If u just get initiate then u still have paladin and elder. In short. Whichever rank you reach the ones below it unlock as well. Once they‚Äôre all unlocked that‚Äôs it for the day.
---
Not quite. There are core differences, it doesn‚Äôt just end the minute you kill a certain leader. You have to actually put effort into doing the uplinks and that.
---
Oh there is another Meat Week tomorrow? Time to get another 300 treasury notes. :D
---
They just did it to force more resource usage and make things take longer to kill.This whole update did a good job at giving the illusion that they added way more content than they actually did.In the end it was a just a sneaky way to turn the grind nature into a slog fest.Here use more resources and more time to do the exact same things in over that you have been doing.Here are daily ops they are just a over glorified daily radial quest.I could keep going on but it would be about as repetitive as the content.
---
Ask someone to make a good melee weapon for you.... nicely.   Offer caps.   I bet 50 percent of players will do it for free, but you don't want to come off as demanding or entitled.
---
Serendipity pops up too super duper also
---
You can do the Ohio adventure run, go all the way through the border you should get about 10
---
I'm sorry too.
---
I did the same today to Earle and there was just me and a lvl 50 
---
Couldn't find the pile at all, there were at least half a.dozen in the area we.thought his goo pile was located.
---
It didn't come across as elitist at all.   Problem is on their end, not yours.
---
(If your on Xbox)  
---
I'l happily carry lower levels through the missions, you just need to keep up, stay on the objective, and if you go down near the objective don't respawn until the game forces you to do it as just your presence there continues the counter.
---
I dont pvp
---
Eh.  Assaultrons can't even hurt me.
---
First was melee
---
I still can't believe they changed the one great feature of the original machine: If I didn't have enough of a certain type of ammo to meet the minimum to convert, that ammo type wouldn't show up. No guesswork.
---
Same.It would be the logical choice,but yeah
---
I played the whole meat weak with chef outfit and flaming chainsaw. I haven't tested it since the patch. Would be a real shame if it's useless next meat weak.
---
To each their own.  If I happen to be the one that "kills" it oh well.  I only use gatling plasmas
---
Yes I‚Äôm almost done with an assassins sentinel set I am one away from an unyielding set it‚Äôs my favorite solar armor plus I heal my group
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm talking about a clean version of the Nuka Cola paint in the game, without the rusty bits and stuff, but I appreciate your offer
---
By gaining more XP (and you can get %100 buff solely from lunchboxes which are now in an infinite supply at the vendors) you will level up faster thus gaining perk coins from level-ups faster.
---
You could definitely make the argument mini nukes should be worth more than a single 10mm round, though.
---
I'm sure for pts footage that it used to pop up. Now it doesn't,but ot sure works.check your damage numbers.
---
Fair enough. I don‚Äôt have a PC, and haven‚Äôt found Fallout or Fallout 2 on Xbox, or Xbox 360. As a result I haven‚Äôt really experienced anything but Bethesda‚Äôs Outcasts (the Outcasts are still following the Codex, I find they‚Äôre straying from their task in DC), the Brotherhood in New Vegas and the Brotherhood in 4. I already don‚Äôt like the Appalachian Brotherhood, for one they refused civilian access to the force, and second they were pressuring the Responders and Free States into giving them supplies that the people they were trying to get them from needed. They didn‚Äôt steal supplies they had already scavenged but they did steal from their claimed areas. A bit like fishing in your stretch of the river. It‚Äôs technically stealing, because I‚Äôm taking fish from part of the river that‚Äôs not mine.
---
Being frozen then immidiately mowed down by gutsys
---
It‚Äôs still good against robots and blood eagles. Anything armed with an energy weapon.
---
So they are still weak ass mobs. They would never survive anywhere now.
---
From what I understand you get 3 chances. Thats for completing each of the 3 time trials. One for EACH of them. So if you get elder on the first try, you roll for tier 1, 2 AND 3 at the same time. Each tier has a different percent for the rare drop to happen. 
---
OR
---
If it takes you 3 separate runs to get each of the times, then it‚Äôs still 3 chances - you just had to do them one at a time.
---
I have, plenty of stuff has. Quit beatig a dead horse.
---
You don't deserve a down vote on this..  
---
I solo the Op at Eldar  rank, as a heavy, my saving grace is a Vampires weapon, never use a stimpak, and yeap weapon repair and armor repair is a bind but it isn't really that bad considering the rewards for completion.
---
In the mid 200s which obviously helps a lot but my point still stands that a mixed build with QOL and damage related perks can work just fine
---
The mutton pie recipe drops every time you successfully finish the event. I don't know who really needs to learn about the goodness of mutton pie, but Bethesda obviously wants absolutely **everyone** to know about it. I just dump that recipe at the nearest train station on the off chance that some random newbie finds it who inexplicably doesn't know that recipe already. :-P
---
The other plans (staff, crook, club and their mods) drop randomly, but also have no conditions attached to their drop chances, AFAIK.
---
Plays fortnite, he aint worth the trouble ma'am.
---
I have three ss chest pieces all 3* an assassins with the jet pack I use all the time and a chameleon asbestos lined one for earl and a trouble shooters with a jet pack for the daily ops robots
---
Its just the texture map used. They had similar things in FO4 on reflective surfaces. You wont ever get the actual reflection. I imagine thats more than the game can handle
---
Can‚Äôt happen
---
Atom shop purchase
---
Ok i can agree mostly i mean i havent been on game for awhile but i disagree on nukashine ok like u can never have egnouth nukashine
---
Man it would be so op with a medium swing speed
---
I mean making fusion cores is easy too, just long and boring
---
No, but my fixers and cursed pick axes don‚Äôt display either, seems to be a bug
---
1/76th assed, to be specific.
---
I‚Äôve had it twice now on the same toon..
---
Awesome! I'm making the max Rifleman to max Commando perk change now. About halfway there.
---
No, sadly, had to return my laptop since that was the one game I wanted to play on it.
---
Fair play, I won‚Äôt be on until about 7pm bst though because of work, send me an add, if I‚Äôve got any junkies or come across any I‚Äôll drop them too you
---
Actually I hate those mf'rs, they come wearing a dress to the freaking ops and boss fights, having no input at all, they only die while the rest have to spend their ammo, chems and way too much time because of them.
---
Repair kits would be a much better reward they're actually useful.
---
Why would you waste flux on fusion cores? It‚Äôs easier to get the perk or if you insist, farm then from power plants.
---
&gt;Do not be fooled by the name "settlers". They are genocidal blood thirsty maniacs and not worthy of our time. Foundation is a dump.
---
Saw an interesting post about Crater vs. Foundation yesterday too - Crater has a farm almost 3x the size of Foundation but are apparently raiders - who steal food amongst other things.
---
Where does foundation get their food? Surely not all from that minuscule farm Ward looks over... But somehow they always have fresh food, Foundation are raiders with a thin veneer of 'civilisation' 
---
Crater OTOH could potentially subside off the land - they're just rednecks with a thin veneer of raiding.
---
Takes up too much space in a CAMP, but yes I will agree it does look  a little "cool", but it's a space hog for no more power. Practicality over "coolness" IMO.  
---
However, I didn't mean to imply that I need more than 100, I probably don't, I just have a habit of adding two FR's when I do a CAMP rebuild.  
---
In hindsight maybe I will just stick with one FR, and save on CAMP space.  
---
But in the end I don't add power generators for "coolness" or any visual reason, I always hide them behind walls, they're a power source, nothing more, out of sight, out of mind.
---
Yeah, my rifleman isn‚Äôt fun to play. I‚Äôve already got a commando, so thinking about making my rifleman a heavy instead

I‚Äôve just gotten the vault 94 stash box 2 times and the burrow signs 2 times besides the brotherhood outfit and mask

Lol we have a awesome original game with a lot of bugs let‚Äôs just have them fix them before moving new shit into the game ,they built the game let them polish it up before they put in more
---
He and the wendigo spawns ate up more than enough ammo before the one wasteland update. The cost in supplies to do this is far too high.
---
Make sure to hack terminals to turn the turrets against the robots and then shut them down. Takes a little longer but it‚Äôs so much easier.
---
Luckeeeee
---
Or just show an animation of your character at the keyboard while it brings up a work bench menu with a ‚Äúscrap‚Äù window that gives tokens, and a craft window that uses the tokens as material.   
---
Or, what I thought they‚Äôd do- the converter breaks down ammo into its constituent parts with a slight loss so you can just craft more.
---
Thanks for responding to my other post, you are a champ!
---
Yeah I get that's annoying and I had the same issue but I did find that daily ops with volitile enemies has more explosions then a Micheal bay movie . And then when you get a volitile super mutant suicider and you drag him . . . It's enough to get mister tourgue flexington to cream his pants
---
Here‚Äôs why in my opinion.
---
Earl gives a  possibility of 3 lengendarys, 2 potentially useful the last one 40 scrip (cursed weapon) and tons of Screws, Acid and Fiberglass Spool as well as ammo return, stimpacks  and radaway sometimes plus 8 treasury notes. 
---
Daily Ops (basic tier repeatable) will net you a much better ammo return, stimpacks and radaway, as well as grenades (caps lol) and ammo that Wendigo Spawns don‚Äôt return (Fusion and Plasma Cores) which on top on that guarantee a legendary drop plus 5-50 scrip beyond daily limit(super important) as a potential reward.
---
Now, depending on where you stand in game progression ( min/max end-game hoard like a dragon hill billy like me or casual end-game) certain rewards take priority over others, do keep in mind that since we all beat Earl‚Äôs asscheeks since day 1 most people have a fuck-ton of screws, acid and fiberglass spool so they hold little to no value in some cases.
---
Now the important part, the time it takes. Daily Ops are commonly completed between 5 and 10 minutes.
---
 Doing ACP takes 5-15 minutes just to get to launch prep if done the intended way (no PA or photo mode glitch), launch prep itself takes around 5 minutes, 2.5 minutes for the nuke to land AND 4 minutes to wait for the rubble to clear, as of now Earl got a bit more difficult to take down so its common to see people take 10 minutes(usually less) on him plus you HAVE to wait 1.5 minutes to get your reward. So you see what I‚Äôm getting at here.
---
tldr; you can do several daily ops in the time of 1 ACP and rewards are so similar that ACP is not optimal if legendary rolls are the main objective
---
First time I did it. I thought, meh I've made many an assualtron my bitch. This will be easy. Oh boy was I wrong. No one showed up to help me, at least that meant that no one saw how she had her way with me.
---
I enjoy them too. Mild annoyance is me playing stealth auto rifle bloodied build. They see me all the time, I can't stealth crit or maintain a legit amount of action points when enemies start pouring on me. This is the first time I happily team up with other people and I'm glad it's so easy to find teams for this purpose. Quick and fun with good rewards and exp. Robots were never this dangerous too, slow effects and some of them rushing on melee charge is very powerful.
---
Thanks for the offer, but it's all good. Finally got it all repaired. The flux was the worst haha
---
He is an ex raider.
---
How does everyone have this outfit but ive got elder everyday and gotten all of 4 plans
---
Oh fuck not more fusion cores I have about 20 just sat in my vendor taking up space in my stash . No one buys them . No one wants them and I don't use power armour so I have no use for them . At least the annoying ammo conversion machine can swap missiles, mini nukes and 40mm rounds.
---
Yes, the server was sadly already nuked out, one of the guys had the very same idea.
---
Me. I've never wanted to nuke a camp because they wanted to offer something for new players. Most vending machines focus on selling higher priced items for more experienced players &amp; I like seeing  people who actually want lower levels to visit &amp; to find something they can afford.   
---
I feel like there are plenty of people who are deliberately interfering with other people's enjoyment of the game &amp; more deserving of the time and effort that it would take to obliterate their camp ;)
---
Level 50 to you, lower level to them. But yea they used to be level 1 in the forest.
---
Because not everybody playing this is lvl 100+++. Low level players participate in the season too and you can argue some of these are useless to them right now. PA skins? Nuke cards? Usable in the future yes, but possibly weeks or months down the line depending on how much they play. Rad aids though? Chances are they aren‚Äôt swimming in them like the bulk of posters here.
---
Most of the people in that group are British, so close enough.
---
Appalachian BoS aren't really the BoS at all. They really just loosely followed Maxson because Taggerdy knew him and there was no other chain of command left. They're all dead now anyway, the BoS who are coming in Steel Dawn are from California, they're part of the original BoS
---
As for the outcasts, that's a bit more tricky to explain. There are two schools of thought in the main BoS
---
Maxson 1, Maxson 3 (Fallout 1's Maxson), McNamara, Rhombus, Lyons etc fall under a more benevolent scope of thought who believe that the BoS can be a force of good that directly helps the world.
---
Maxson 2, Maxson 5 (Fallout 4's Maxson), Hardin, The West Coast council and the Outcasts believe in a secluded BoS who protect mankind from itself by hoarding technology. Maxson 5 is a little different because he decides to actively engage in a war with the Institute but that's still rooted in technology acquisition
---
I sent you a request. Just send me a message on psn when you get on.
---
I‚Äôve got this card maxed (40%) but doesn‚Äôt trigger an ‚Äòit‚Äôs working‚Äô animation like super duper does for example.. I read somewhere that they‚Äôd scrapped the animation for when it kicks in. I definately feel the card is working though..
---
It's their attempt to combat inflation. It doesn't work at all though
---
Sweet
---
I'll have to take your word for it, but I appreciate you saying that. I'll have to keep an eye out for a vampire weapon. Never hurts to try
---
The hardest thing about todays Ops was not getting lost in that fucking maze.
---
Ward is a asshole but the only thing I can really do to him is to throw all of my useless Floater Grenades at him.
---
It‚Äôs a real shame you ain‚Äôt Xbox. I‚Äôd be able to put him through the quest line and all that. The codes are complicated to crack, so I recommend Nukacrypt.
---
They rather spend time on other stuff,which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it, and probably just shat it out asap.
---
Two options to have you over-loaded with Frags in 30 minutes. 
---
Set up survival tent near Top of the World (if you have it)
---
At the top, before you go into see Rose, each Raider corpse usually has one.
---
Now, FT over to Charleston Trainyard. Once there, hop down and follow the tracks toward the train station. You'll be crossing two red bridges. As you cross the 2nd one an event spawn will appear near the shack opposite the station. 9 times out of 10, for me at least, this spawn is always 4 Super Mutants. Each has a Frag on them. 
---
Server hop until you have ample supply.
---
Congratulations on getting your partner to be a part of your gaming pursuits! I am very envious as I have tried to persuade my partner to play as well but its been all for naught sadly. Open stoves aside, I hope that you two have many joyous days ahead of you remodeling your camps to your hearts content. Remember, the family that games together stays together.
---
The health curve goes ballistic.
---
Seems to be working for me, I did see somewhere that it doesn‚Äôt work with suppressor for whatever reason.
---
my guess is that it's a hacked weapon. the way they used to be modifed allowed for some weird side effects if you didn't do it properly.
---
Now blaze it.
---
A few plans for your camp. Anyway tomorrow is the meat week event and "meat week Grahm" sells the same stuff as "normal Grahm" so is easy to spam servers on it to get all those plans rather than trigger random encounter hoping to spawn the normal one.
---
The plans: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm#Merchandise
---
&gt;To each their own.  If I happen to be the one that "kills" it oh well.
---
You are of course right - at an event where 8 players shoot tons of ammunition it is of course your good to be stubborn
---
Sometimes you should just pay attention to the other participants and it is not too much to ask to take the last shots with a weapon that does not have the property of potentially making the loot disappear for everyone
---
I love it! I'm most of the time leaving with an extra 1000 fuel.
---
They better be repeatable and they better be awarding rep
---
I'd just sit back and let them fight, and let social media judge them for their actions. Maybe.
---
Initiate Dodge is still alive. He deserted. And I don‚Äôt particularly like him either.
---
Ok thank you so much! Sorry for the stupid question!
---
You're just looking for it more.
---
Boi. The only ‚Äústupid question‚Äù is the one you dont ask.ü§ô Just as the answers always ‚ÄúNo‚Äù until you ask.  (Theres my words of wisdomüòÇüòÇ)
---
That‚Äôs why so many don‚Äôt like the new update. Me included. If they fix and stop this scaled enemies then I may start playing again. I‚Äôm so sad cuz I really enjoyed this game for the past few years. Not anymore
---
I followed the exact path as yourself in regards to getting rid of that god awful machine. The worst part of using it has to absolutely be if you cashed in or produced large amounts of ammo and you need to exit out of it. I don't know if this occurs on other platforms, but on the xbox that chore alone requires endless amounts of button mashing just to back out of the windows and return to the normal game mode. Daily Ops is pretty much an ammo farm fest so that's the way to go.
---
I just want to make it clear: as long as you don't do it on purpose, there is nothing to excuse, because we all assumed that this could no longer happen
---
It looks like old code fragments have been incorporated into the latest patch
---
Grab a Flamer and the 'Friendly Fire' perk and just stand at one of the Uplinks healing any player that comes close. 
---
Wait, Friendly Fire might be level locked, I'm not sure.
---
Yeh I've got a sentinel Assassin set, 3 AP pieces. And I've got a full Vanguard Sentinel set. I scrip Unyielding on solar, just started Thorn though, not had a decent roll yet though.
---
Waiting for the people who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get a good item drop since Diablo 2 was released‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs rng. And it will always be. And you won‚Äôt remember those two runs where you get rare stuff. You‚Äôll only remember those two runs where you didn‚Äôt get it.
---
6 FEET APART!!!
---
Different question...lvl 400 here
---
Just wondering about the once per day thing
---
I work so sometimes ill play at night but forget to run an op...so say i run a Op at 11 am get the elder rank... because i didnt run one after noon the day before...once the noon reset comes in..does the new op drop a rare as well?
---
Or when im 'done for the day' is it a 24 hr reset.
---
Simply...i didnt log in within 23 hours i run an elder rank at 1130...do i get to get a rare chance again at 1230? Or do i have to wait 24 hrs between elder runs
---
You must be getting the wrong legendaries. Best one I have obtained, was yesterday actually. Is a junkies Exploding double barrel shotgun. Level 5 explosives with max shotgun perks. Over 300 damage. I'm one shotting almost everything in Vats. I DONT run junkies fyi
---
I dont really follow the meta, the most damage Im putting out is like 178 üòÖ but it works just fine most things die pretty fast.
---
It's BE90rw 50 cal. There's no any weird legendary effects on it :(
---
you're using a bugged weapon my main man
---
a lot of people think the game is too easy but don't realize they're playing with busted weapons.
---
Yeah My combat shotty does 180. Pump 190. Gauss SG does 626 I believe
---
&gt; Scale the match percentage down from 1 to something like 0.5, and see how that fares 
---
Or give players a slider in their settings to allow them to scale the difficulty to what they prefer. Players who want more of a challenge can dial it up and have relatively harder enemies, and those who want it easier can scale it down. Everyone's happy!
---
Im wearing a gas mask, its fine.
---
Turn the event on, if the "bugs" bother people they can skip it.
---
I played it a lot last year and had very few problems!
---
Naw I know the magic effects. My Double barrel SG does not have one of those.
---
mate what? these cards are in the game, i'm referring to cards giving a bonus when having a matching set of armor like Funky Duds for instance(which is in fact in the game rn)
---
Amen I HATE, HATE, HATE the Burrows.
---
Fuck that joint.
---
Say it again!
---
So we can tame cats now
---
Does it have any extra damage numbers below the ballistic damage number?
---
Upvoted for sheer awesomeness.
---
I'm doing fine after the update, I just had to change weapons around which I luckily already had in my stash. The only real downside for me is the added ammo grind, it isn't harder just more tedious, for me anyway. 
---
But I can understand lots of people aren't. My level 20 friend just stopped playing, used more resources than he gained in fights. People that were builders, RPers, and so on are having a hard time.
---
You are not the only one there are good amount of players that feel the same way.Some have even already moved on to greener pastures.It won‚Äôt be the same game you were playing even if you fiddle with perks etc but it might get a little better.
---
your comment makes no sense at all. they don't disconnect me or anything like that. i just have 900+ treasury notes but stuck at 5000 gold already. it's not for me, it's for NEW players who don't have all plans they need...
---
Yeah, noticed that too. You can shoot your way up to 95% hitchance if you don't want to run another 3 meters.
---
What of all of the Church of Atom followers are actually just Bloodied Build? ü§îü§îü§î
---
I know. but back when it was still possible to modify items with whatever effects you wanted, people created all sorts of god rolls to multiply and sell. a BE90 .50 cal sounds like the perfect candidate.
---
for example, there used to be a lot of uny/ap/sen urban scout sets without a secondary mod slot, or a skin slot. tons of level 50 BE laser guns, and 'legacy' forest scout sets with the titan effect.
---
just a guess on my part, but maybe your gun used to be one of those energy .50 cals, and whoever traded it with you removed the mods so it'd look normal. except for the 100 rounds drum.
---
it does. junkie's is one of them.
---
Vats is straight up Fed with shotguns. I run a SG Vats build and it's hell now.
---
HATE IT!!!! :D
---
Well if you ask half of this sub things have gotten way to hard now  even with legendary gear. And the game is now unplayable
---
I for one think things are fine haha
---
Hmph, crazy how‚Äôd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
---
Shit your right! I just re looked at angry turtles vid. Well that sucks
---
they probably should change the legendary effects then, troubleshooter is only 30% against a certain enemy type, while bloodied adds 95% weapon base damage to all enemys.
---
That's what I do too. I'll usually only do most events in private now. Although I've done it the last couple of days in public trying to level up my low level and I've had good luck. But now that the legendarys drop at your level it's definitely worth it.
---
I think it's one of the best events.
---
You kinda got slapped off that tent there. Still sweet though. wouldnt mind having a buncha queens drop instead just one
---
This game is a pile of shit, but i still love it ü§£ did the raid on vault 79 last night and the stealth suit lady and army dude was absolutely useless seriously bethesda wtf... They was both completely ignoring enemies and then decided the best way to help me was to continually shoot a dead corpse on the floor for a solid 3 mins, they only stopped because i had moved on.
---
This, it's a way of getting xaps out of the system to keep prices down.
---
how much accuracy is your shotgun?VATS issue has been much better after I mod my gauss shotty to around 60 accuracy with refined receiver and scope mod, you may try it.
---
No, only standart ballistic damage
---
This worked perfectly, thank you!!
---
Maybe swap the Rad-x and Radaway for brain bombs.
---
Yeah everything feels way more.....balanced lmao. Despite the backlash.
---
We could but a pack is 8 coins
---

---
those are the drop rates.
---
Regular events need weekly exotic plans and cosmetics that can drop from a high event. Higher chance for the drop the harder the event.
---
Given I've now had two Super Reactors and more these are dropping. Give it time.
---
Why can't the Ammo Converter be a vendor? You sell your ammo at any quantities, you get currency, you buy ammo with that currency. Done.
---
Cheers
---
Can you post an image of it when you inspect it?
---
The mutant hounds need to be glowing.
---
Thanks man! Gonna take one for sure
---
Lode bearing is fun but bugged :(    most of the more veins in there you cant even collect.
---
LOL! Like I tried to do my 1x Event for the daily SCORE and decided to defend my recently claimed Hemlock Holes.

If you are on pc i can build one for you
---
Oh, and after killing those three the bar showed as barely a third complete for WAVE ONE.
---
And God roll deathclaw gauntlet
---
I won't be surprised if they add an actual, alive furry skin lol
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up
---
I bought the plan and it dropped for me after the reset. I didn't even notice until i was dumping my plans in my stash
---
Explosive bait should only be craftable for the quest, and not for any other time.  
---
Anyone that irritates me sufficiently in FO76 gets blocked, not just the in-game blocking, which is temporary, I will block them on my console.
---
I‚Äôve done 4 daily ops. 1 per day. 2 days in a row I got the sympto matic. It‚Äôs only got a 3% drop rate if you finish in 8 mins. I just got super lucky. 
---
My husband who did the daily ops with me each day has never gotten 1 rare reward from daily ops. So it‚Äôs just random.
---
It's based off reset. I'm West Coast so i get my next chance at 9am each day and I have 'til 9am the following day to use it.
---
We don't have any decent cap sinks so player vendors and fast travel are really the only consistent ones we have.
---
You could probably make up a reason but Bethesda hasn't bothered so why should we look for a reason.
---
Little tip. At WS golf club there‚Äôs a drinking fountain in the little bandstand place that cures all disease if u drink from it.
---
I think preemptively that‚Äôs my worry, I‚Äôll put a bunch of time in to get the right perks and equipment and I still won‚Äôt get the same enjoyment, and I get it‚Äôs my issue, and not the games issue per se.
---
Turrets are lvl 50 now too. They actually are a lot better now from my experience.
---
I'm using a non legendary fixer for 250 to 300 damage
---
I predominately use power armour and have an absolute blast with it, but that's beside the point. I remember what it was like being that low level, and legendary armor doesn't grow on trees. Farming a couple of spawn locations for lv 40-45 PA is easy, relatively safe, and could be all the difference between a newer player getting the bulkiness they need to keep going on. Sure, there are a lot of ways that regular armor outclasses PA late game, but I sure as hell remember it being a huge help when I was first traveling post-apocalypse West Virginia. Legendary Armor is amazing, but not much good focusing on it when you're not even at the 50 cap. Most players I see don't even manage to get a solid build with good rolls on legendaries until post-100, so I'm just looking at more cost and time-efficient ways that newer players can keep on pushing through and enjoying the game.
---
Got it. Ty. Been getting elders first time everytime so good to know that if i dont do it right away an only have free time slightly before an after reset i can get two rare plans within an hour or two.
---
Just a quick heads up. If this season is the same a last season between level 52 and 53 the required score will increase by 50 not 25 and then it will revert to 25 per level. So level 52 requires 2250, 53 requires 2300, and 54 requires 2325.
---
The reason I noticed this is that I have a spreadsheet recording the amount of score I receive from non-repeatable challenges, plus the current level and how much score above the current level. I use this information to calculate the amount of score I have received from the repeatable challenge. I noticed that at level 53 I was suddenly not getting multiples of 100.
---
You know what I forgot, most things take two swipes.
---
Always left with like 1% health &gt;:(
---
There‚Äôs also a fire pit if you‚Äôre into that
---
Ah one of the Yao Guai's that were affected by the stealth suit field trials, they roam the lands, phasing in and out of our sight, only to appear right next to you, but only to say Ni Hao (Hello).
---
I have to pop a vintage to get results
---
Yeah, I'm only level 35 currently so I'm still working my way to being able to get the plans. I do 3-4 runs a day. Seems to be the best way to level up. Sub 8 mins for 1000 XP. Should be lvl 50 by this weekend. Good luck though, man.
---
I was using rank 3 Concentrated Fire and I didn't notice the help as it doesn't give you +20% on automatic weapons anymore. I've gone down to Rank 1 and feel absolutely fine.
---
I got Valley Galleria Signs and Liquid Courage plans in my very first group-run daily op!
---
What I can do?
---
I really wanted to tame a fox but I don't think they ever spawn solo. :(
---
By modules
---
Pretty useless for , maxed out survival shortcut :) . And i have a mule for chems ,  weapons , food 
---
Been playing too much since day 1 lol
---
Venom Snake held one of the lowest ranks in the BoS and was out of it by 2093 at the latest (and likely earlier, as he states he spent a decade or so as a slave) so he really wasn't heavily involved with them. Regardless, he isn't part of the BoS who are on their way, he's just trying to ensure comms networks are up for them when they arrive out of respect for those who died in his absence
---
If.its just a BE fixer or it doesn't have the 25 less vats effect. Then guass minigun if ammo isn't a issue
---
While it says "spawn alone," does this count if it's a group of the same animal? Say, three housecats spawn together, are they viable targets?
---
No, I've tried everything, there doesn't seem to be a button to unlock it, and it hasn't unlocked automatically. Ticket it is I think, and thankyou
---
Unfortunately not
---
Follow through, like taking one for the team, doesn't have pop-up. The  perk is not for farming mobs cause it works after more than 1 sec after  the first shot, so if you kill the mob in less than 1 sec, you will not  see increase damage. It works for tough mob like Mireluke queen or boss  fights. There are also a strange connection between  tenderizer-suppressor and follow through that need to be tested cause it  seems it's buggy, but no data for now IMO.
---
I‚Äôm PS4, thanks though
---
Try a Heavy Weapon (STR) and commando (PER) build. I run a stealth commando and my brother runs a stealth commando that also does heavy weapons. Quite the build for him.
---
Interesting. Do you know if the thrown explosive legendary perk card works with grenade launcher?
---
Wait they fixed it??? Wow I night swap in that charisma legendary perk so I can put friendly fire on, might be a bit op considering its explosive heals from miles away ;)
---
I've had 3 rare drops so far, two duplicates. Annoying. and one without a rare drop at all
---
afraid there's nothing you can do. \**sometimes*\* removing all mods and applying/removing a skin reverts them back to normal. but I don't think it'd work in this case.
---
another oddity is that sometimes these weapons can't be repaired.
---
I'd have traded you for the Valley Galeria plan if you were on Xbox! Love the look of the Burrows signs
---
Have an upvote for your enthusiasm.
---
Love the update, love the scaling generally, but insects and similar at least need to be dialed back. Mole Rats are little bastards
---
Yeh weirdly when I'm just wandering down there I can find my way, but being timed I get lost to fuck üòÇ
---
How interesting, 300 range. Defenitly a hacked weapon.
---
Poorly. We'll have to look for a new one.
---
I buy like 3 3*s at a time so I can get 2 days of scrip back but keep my scrip towards 1k incase there's a sale
---
Yeah? Shit. Try to turn it back to seller
---
Completely agree! It doesn't take much prep either as you can run many loadouts. These have just been a fun race against the clock, it can be pretty hectic running through a wall of exploding enemies! xD I hope they add plenty more to these ops in future seems like a great foundation for simple new content. I wonder if they'll add any weird effects to the players going forward? Maybe noxious gas in the burrows making everyone drunk like the nukeshine effect
---
9 is the right number
---
Ahhh OK. In my experience I've never seen the damage increase after 5, but thanks anyway dude
---
Yea I tried using it a few times but its SO weak :( Maybe with the new 'damage nerf' stuff like this can be buffed now they can calculate damage more accurately? Mr Handy Buzz blade too maybe? That always seemed weak too
---
Yeah thats right. I assembled my legendary perks like i did with my other perks, min/maxing.
---
I use 4 special stats, funky duds and taking one for the team. I have the ammo one at lvl2, but kicked it out for another special perk because they're just too good.
---
Also i don't see any ammo problems in the future, given some players even got it maxed out and likely will sell whats too much for their stash. Not to mention the fuckton of ammo you get in the daily ops.
---
"  he pushed me into an open fire stove IRL so maybe not lol " My english is sometimes really bad. So did i really understand ? 
---
He pushed you in a open fire ? Are you okay ?
---
Ward is a bit of a dick, though the reason for hating him seems a bit meta. I posted about this a couple of months ago that it would be nice if the Settlers had a strong 'non-meta' reason to roleplay disliking them, and vice versa for the Raiders.
---
In my headcannon, the Settlers are hostile to all ghouls and mutants, even people like Mordechai and Grahm (they made an exception for Penelope because she had something to offer they were interested in) and regularly turn away starving scavengers because they don't want more mouths to feed unless you're able to work as a farmer, builder or guard.
---
The Raiders will take anyone in who is willing to join them on raids and have a more relaxed attitude towards sharing the spoils of a raid with a new member who didn't contribute much because strength in numbers and keeping as many people fit and strong as possible is how they survive.
---
It's not quite borne out in lore, for example most of the Raiders didn't give a shit when Ra-Ra or Lou went missing and gaining their trust is more difficult than with the settlers but in my head it's the reason why I don't just go fully hostile towards the Raiders.
---
500 to modules and the rest to weapons. I rather roll my own SeSe armour than chance it with murg.

Wait 5 minutes when you spawn in, at least 1 should hopefully turn up,doable if you both go straight to objectives and stay near the uplink, if lower than lv150 I would wait until another person turns up as I find lower levels are more likely to screw it up with constantly going away from uplink or not running to the next point. 3 people is easy time. If bloody sneak commando do yourself a favour and jump into a pa, serendipity isn't gonna save your ass like it used to anymore as you can't sneak kill everything, just means you will have slightly less ap if using vats but adrenanline and damage perks will see you through, is doable in normal armour though just bring a ton of stimpacks. Hmmmm what else oh yeah stay near the bloody uplink lol

Just a larger version of the fusion reactor. Looks cool and isn‚Äôt as loud has a unique hum to it with electricity effects and lots of steam. I think its cool but really it should produce 300 energy or more since its so massive so a huge miss for Bethesda on this part but then again 100 energy is all you really need.
---
You use all 1000 in one go?
---
Some of the exams fail you multiple times for no reason, keep trying.
---
Nice! I found an invincible mothman a while back n got a pic with him, went for a cheesy thumbs up next to him as if we were biddies xD
---
I'm pretty sure it's working for me but I don't have the little animation pop up. I haven't checked damage numbers but it definitely feels like it's working.
---
0.4% chance to roll all 3 Tiers (or 1/250) not awful odds. I've not seen anyone roll a triple yet but I live in hope!
---
What I wouldn't give to play this game with the other half...
---
Noice! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about I haven‚Äôt lead ran in a few weeks I‚Äôm trying to deflect my stash i got now roughly 20ish thousand or so, I don‚Äôt t go through it as much either since the update, ammo smith rank 4 is ridiculous, I‚Äôm swimming in ultracite rounds and fusion cores that and daily ops nets me at least 500 or more round in itself today wasn‚Äôt as much though as I only got 310.
---
You might want to read more Whitesprings entries. They‚Äôre responsible for most of the horrific stuff in Appalachia lol
---
I've read a few times that glow sight has zero effect on wendigos and Earle at that event.
---
And less time to murder a gaggle of Snallygasters too
---
Actually no, if you are a junkie you take a penalty to special stats, which is negated by using unyielding gear boosting all specials up again at lower health (way higher than what you will loose because of the addictions)
---
I‚Äôll be honest I assumed it did. I‚Äôm too busy killing everything to have noticed tbh lol. It 100% makes a difference on glowing enemys usually compared to the armour penetration one
---
Yep, trick with camera helps tremendously after Enryctid event - when Sheepsquatch imposter blows and his body is nowhere to be found I use camera trick. Unfortunately recently I encountered new kind of bug I haven't seen before last patch - some enemies spawns below the ground (one of Waste Not robots did that - still attacked me, I couldn't aim at him or lock with VATS and when I've killed it with grenade, I couldn't loot him from Red Rocket Core - marker showed him underground).
---
I started getting legendary modules so I can re roll my SS armour but now I have a bunch of 3* legendary junk that I'm waiting to scrip so I'm holding back
---
Keep failing then
---
Thank you hahahaüòÇ
---
Beware sneak is actually a little buggy at the moment. It's possible if your numbers and visual damage aren't adding up that it's actually sneak having issues. 
---
Some folk aren't having issues,
---
Some folk are doing way more damage outside of sneak (Myself included)
---
Some folk can't sneak attack in VATS (Myself included)
---
Some folk can't sneak attack with ADS. 
---
There's something fishy with the Coding to do with sneak that they're going to have to fix.
---
I bought a 2point perk card and it only gave me 2 points but it costed me 2 lvls to buy
---
That would be nice haha. But for most people with a lot of levels banked up it's to late. I had about 150 to deal with, as well as 24 perk packs.
---
I just kept doing adamantium skeleton. Once it was to r3 and r2 it was all just the r1 card. Took a while though haha
---
No. It depends on the day and my carry weight that moment. Or if I have the time to test my luck. I try to keep at least 250 scrip at all times.
---
Ahhh right, thanks
---
Thought it was datamined that it was 40% for rare and 60% for the common?
---
 Come, join us. Drink from the waters of the Glow!!!
---
Hacked weapon.
---
I still don't understand why the ammo converter doesn't have a vendor-like interface..  
---
I'm guessing they couldn't implement an in-camp vendor with a different currency than caps without breaking the code...  
---
... and if they used caps that would have fucked up the game's economy.
---
So, we're stuck with this... *thing*... I don't think Bethesda is going to change anything...
---
Dont think so, its like the perfect pie ..people think it will sell because its "rare"
---
No, nothing new about it. There will always be people around that have not gotten the memo on how the data pages work. They are still useless when bought in stacks.
---
This has happened to me three times now. Not only when levelling up score,either. I completed one daily challenge, not levelling up and it cycled through all the levels ive already unlocked just to show me a riny but of progress through the level
---
On xbox, no paid levels.
---
Yeah, I barely managed to open all my packs without getting bored. After reaching 50 and using the rest on the perks I needed and moving points around I stopped levelling because I didn't need to.
---
It would take about 100 levels max I think because if you put the points where you wanted by level 50 and got none of the correct cards, you'd need another 50 or so for them all. Or if you had some correct ones and moved some around it would be similar. I'm over level 200 so I had about 100 spare. Moved more around and made my build fit the legendary perks a bit more
---
Aren't the assets just copied over from fo4 ?
---
"The resale and scrip return value is far better on 3"  
---
Resale, maybe. But scrip?  
---
A 2 star costs 50 to make, and then you get 15 for trading it in, a net loss of 35 scrip.  
---
A 3 star takes 100 to make, and then gets 40 for trading in, a net loss of 60.
---
Just sit true it , its not that much work tbh
---
It appeared on the menu every day for over a month, you're either blind or you don't play often. The Brotherhood broadcast was on the radio list for 2+ months.
---
I'll probably get it done a but at a time
---
Misunderstanding!? o.O
---
I didnt think it was rare though, at least 1 container always has it in the launch room of silos
---
I've seen alot of post in that one sub that shall not be named, they claim there's a way to trigger it over and over again. I'm mad because I had one to 40 and dumped them a week ago lol.
---
My thoughts exactly after first time using the machine. But don't get your hopes up, look at other ui and menus. Are there any of them you can call responsive and user friendly?
---
Uhh.. wait, what??
---
Any tips on how to harvest dirty water quickly? I seem to get stuck waiting for the sound effect and it is painfully slow since 2 harvests = 1 boiled water
---
As a stealth crippling build i really hate the daily ops. Tried to complete yesterdays daily op solo, after thirty minutes and at least 20 deaths i caved in. Imagine playing this game religiously, every day for two years, perfecting your build, almost reaching level 200 for bethesda to strip your build down to a more-or-less useless build.
---
WE GET IT YOU'RE VEGAN!
---
Jokes aside, using carnivore is just as easy. And you can just pick up and eat what you kill. No need to spend camp budget on growing things. Or traveling to farms to pick up veggies all the time. Or going to pick up water, boil it, make some soup etc.. Grab a piece of big fat juicy bloody steak from a mutant hound you just killed, slap it on the grill and eat it. Or if you are in a hurry eat it raw like a man's man.
---
I made 19k ultracite 45 the other day with about 50 cobalt flux. Love that legendary perk.
---
&gt; I don't know why they couldn't instance a vendor interface after doing the terminal entry....  
---
Maybe it's CAMP-related? Maybe the thing going with ammo points is not compatible with a vendor interface in a CAMP...  
---
Or maybe they're just lazy/stingy and didn't want to spend the hours ($$$)  required to make it right
---
Yeah I'm at level 413 now and have 3 cards maxes, 1 at r3, at 2 at r2.
---
Have like 20 coins atm, and need 650 to max. You get 400 coins per 100 levels. So I need like 175 something levels to max out my remaining cards (damn) 
---
I think maxing all cards by level 600 will be about standered for most people
---
Edit, you only get 360 coins per 100 levels my math was off. So yeah it's gunnu be a bit
---
I'm not including season reward perk packs though
---
You don gay apparel, not dawn it.
---
He was just waiting for you to look him in the eyes just for him to run away.
---
This game has just become significantly worse with the latest update. After playing religiously for two straight years, i think this is the final nail in the coffin for me to move on from this bugfest of a game 
---
Yeah KeEp Up ThE gOoD wOrK
---
For real. My dmg resist is at 562, and my Energy resist is 400. You also get 300 rad resist. I rolled all chameleon so that I'm a tanky, sneaky melee build. The grind for modules sucks, but the SS armor is amazing.
---
try playing no pa heavy with a minigun... so much FUN
---
Like ss armor, I found out yesterday.
---
And yet for all the ex-raiders Rocksy sends you after, she never bothers with Ward. Why? What does she know about him that we don't?
---
(As an aside, I'm fairly sure Rocksy is just as bloodthirsty as Ward. After the 50th raider you'd think she'd realise that this "sending a message" thing isn't working, but she still sends me out every other day to shoot a runaway raider.)
---
I have had this issue for as long as i can remember, it does the same thing when trying to cook or build ammo its initial load can take ages.
---
Probably it has something to do with the in-CAMP vendors being able to process caps only as currency.  
---
Thus the terminal. Thus the shitty interface. Thus the complains
---
At a water pump, select the drink option then spam collect as the water comes out of the pump.
---
I got lucky on the second day and hit 3 drops. 2 of them were vault 94 stash box plans tho, the third was The Gutter plan. Kinda meh rolls but still cool to see.
---
Stand at water, look down, spam the pick up button.
---
Well, that's how I do it anyway xD
---
It's an extra 2% xp for each int
---
If you're using a ranged character you're putting yourself at a huge potential DPS disadvantage by not utilising Herbivore though, which was the entire point of the post. Vegetables OP and all.
---
i dont think you can trigger it with the data you've collected, but im pretty sure giving one to someone else will trigger the mission for them. Just have to find a dude that also has 40 spare ones and trade them 1 by 1 at turn in point
---
Is it the same placement for the signal repeaters or whatever as it was the first burrows OP? Took me three runs to learn the best way around that map. But if those spots changed, back to square one.
---
M E L O N S !
---
IMO, you've always gotta keep room in your perk cards for a power armor setup in this game.  Bethesda obviously intended it to be the META for end game fights in this game (plus you could argue it's lore-correct).  Personally I normally run a stealth commando/rifleman setup, but I always keep enough points in strength and intelligence to switch on heavy gunner/power armor when it's time to run a silo, fight the queen, etc.
---
Fixed
---
That's where they return to mate.
---
I find heavys to be much more enjoyable, have a level 413 junkies pa heavy and a level 120 bloodied commando
---
Heavys just offer a lot more variety. Since that vast majority of the guns are usable and all function a bit differently. And you can carry all of them with bear arms
---
While rifles are all the same, you need to be running a handmade or fixer. Everything else is clearly worse
---
Plus I prefer storming in to sneaking.
---
That being said both are very good builds, it comes down to the play style you want
---
Sneak is still one of the biggest bumps in damage. We spend 9 ranks for a 60% boost while just sneaking with 3 ranks of covert operative gives you a 150% boost.
---
Also Crits are still to my knowledge based on a percentage of base weapon damage and does not use any perks besides those that boost crit damage.
---
Really wish we could tame the pets and have them follow us like companions in the previous fallout games. Maybe that‚Äôs too big of a dream hahah. I also wanna tame a Mothman for Mothman worshipping character.
---
Yeah. Things arnt suppose to be super easy. Certainly not if you only have qol perks and a semi modded gun. You are suppose to use combat perks and good gear for combat.
---
I'm good great in combat but can't carry half the junk others are carrying. But you dint see me complaining that carry weight needs a buff
---
I'd recommend going heavy PA with that Bloody Guass. The new legendary perks seem to sync up really well with it. 
---
Bloody sneak commando or Bloody heavy PA are both fun builds though. Depends on the playstyle you want. 
---
I have maxed Commando but I still use some heavy weapons with no problem with no Heavy Gunner cards.
---
Yeah, I'm level 227 and already have 1 maxed card, Hack and Slash, and have some others levelled once or twice. But not being 300 I don't have the 6th slot yet. I want to max out at least 2, brawling chemist being the other, and hopefully get exploding palm up more and also taking one for the team. Being bloodied unarmed means I'll probably get hit by stronger enemies if I can't kill them in a hit or two so usually bosses so having a flat out damage multiplier against them would be perfect
---
How many lol
---
Does take a minute, but I did it a few days after the patch.  When I exited the menu finally I was dehydrated and starving but I have all my coins now.
---
Would definitely be convenient just to cash in levels for coins though instead of buying the same card over and over.
---
What‚Äôs the point of hoarding?
---
So there's no cooldown if you press drink first?
---
:((
---
You gotta beat the wastelanders storyline to get access to the stuff you can buy with gold
---
Are you looking in the right folder? Took me ages to find the folder where the pics are saved for the game
---
Taking one for the team gives a pretty sizable boost to everyone attacking your target. It is a great perk that I think everyone should take haha
---
Melee, unarmed especially got some great legendary perks
---
I like keeping corn mutfruit and tatos around for the vegetable starch I'll never run out of adhesive again
---
I don‚Äôt know why this is so hard for people to grasp. An online service has ongoing costs, especially when there is new development going on
---
Does Gramps kill the tamed pet? My CAMP is in between Welch and Lewisberg and I accidentally built on top of 2 animal spawns (Fireflies and Opossums) so they are frequently wandering around my CAMP. Only downside is, the fireflies appear as hostile so Gramps shoots them dead every single time they respawn. I tried to hide his chair on my house roof, but he threw a grenade at them instead üòÇ He doesn't attack the Opossums for some reason (thank god) but I'm not sure how they differ from fireflies in terms of enemy type or whether he is fond of shooting tamed pets üòÇ
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink
---
Placement seems to be the same every time and I guess there is a reason for it (distance), I would not mind placement variation though.
---
I got lucky and got the plan on day 3 of the daily ops, it was the one plan I particularly wanted so anything else from here on in is gravy.
---
Just going to take time and RNG. I've had 6 elder runs, 1 with no plan reward and yesterday was a duplicate V94 stash box drop.
---
Definitely. Exploding Palm is basically a legendary effect. I works the same as explosive bullets doing 20% of base damage so I moved points into int (since legendary strength gave some points back) and added Demolition Expert to buff the damage to about a third of my base damage (32%). A great damage multiplier and that of course stacks with Taking One for the Team to buff that 132% event further. Before putting those on the build wasn't as broken as I thought it would be and I could still one hit level 50-75. Some 75 take 2 or 3 depending on the enemy but I like the scaling across the map now and with the legendary perks they're buffed more so the Exploding Palm can kill enemies that would normally take more than one hit and Hack and Slash kills crowds I don't even have to look at. The initial nerf was negligible as it was
---
Fixed mine too because I passed up the opportunity to say gay apparel lol.
---
Pip boy light does some funky stuff.  Always bugs me if you sit down to play an instrument the light starts coming out of your butt, even though the pip boy is generally on your front side.

Praise his holy vengefulness and be accepted into his presence.

Start a second third fourth fifth character on your account and use them as mules to hold all your extra items everyone else does
---
Both have cooked meals that increase specials, buff AP regen and Max AP, resistances, XP bonuses, carry weight and max health etc etc.
---
Only difference is...
---
Meat eaters get melee damage food exclusively. But using melee is a no no already.
---
Veggie people get crit damage bonus food exclusively. But crit damage bonus is pretty useless as proven by youtubers.
---
So to say, "huge potential DPS disadvantage" is just wrong. 
---
Go with whatever you like better and find more practical to use.
---
It does seem that they have bias to power armour builds. No matter how long you spend perfecting your secret service set of armour, youll always be better off in power armour. Honestly i dislike the way power armour moves, the way it sounds, the way it looks. Plus its just inconveniently heavy, and so are the cores. And yes i appreciate there are perks to counter this, but then you end up putting a load of perks into a power armour build, its not a small commitment.
---
Grahm has lots of unusual plans that are randomly generated, everytime I see him I always check his plans out and he always has at least a couple of plans that I need
---
Same thing happens with the fly boy mask
---
I don't use the steam version, maybe for whatever reason it saves the photomode pics in another folder? Usually they all end up in documents/my games/fo76/pictures/UserIDnumber, only screenshot via printscreen end up in the install folder if I remember correct.
---
Pretty much what I meant yeah.
---
id love an event tab! its just annoying to search the map for them...
---
If my dedicated Crit character can turn 230 damage shots into 700+ damage shots I'd go against what you just stated to do with Crit being useless.
---
As for youtubers, you do realise damage calculations were literally just changed right? 
---
So Crits now are MUCH more predominant in terms of viability. 
---
Before you go claiming what others think is wrong because you're willing to follow someone like a sheep, please, think for yourself.
---
I can Tank all three pylons and a dozen gutsies shooting at me all at once thanks to my build, equipment and little secret- and I‚Äôm Bloodied. So there‚Äôs no excuse to not take at least one pylon.
---
Try using these weapons on Earle or the Queen, it just isn't viable for that anymore!
---
[Here's a list](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76\)) of all PA spawns. Those in the forest region at least *should* be usable at low levels. Remember to grab the fusion cores even if you can't use all the pieces, and you should be good for a while.
---
I can think for myself thank you. Obviously you can't because you are getting so upset by this :)
---
What's the best way to transfer items between characters?
---
You obviously never read the post. Lol....
---
&gt;If my dedicated Crit character can turn 230 damage shots into 700+ damage shots I'd go against what you just stated to do with Crit being useless.
---
You don't need crit damage buff to do that you know. Crit damage bonus is very mediocre buff. You need to read up about how sneak crits and vats crits actually work.
---
Only with other players, the third rank has 'Team Recommended' because the timers are fixed.
---
Congrats on your run though üëç
---
I didn't even nkow you could fucking tame creatures in this game. I thought that was always a temporary thing. Pacify makes it non hostile, tame makes it fight for you for a certain amount of time...not permanently.
---
To to kill the ass raping molerats that erupt from the sewers.
---
Yeah with it at r3 and in sh pa I still take a ton of rads in rad rumble haha
---
Won't you still have a chance to get new mutations though? And what about walking threw someone's rad shower on accident? I wouldn't risk taking off starched genes haha
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a gap for the bear costume too, I hate it. The neck of the body costume should be all the way up...
---
Tried taking a radx to suppress mutations.
---
Yeah, not a fan of the scaling.  I know it's cold and more than a little snobby, but we worked hard to make it through the Mire and Cranberry Bog.  We paid our dues. Now we have noobs running around, doing a Whitesprings nuke zone all willy nilly.  Being a local legend in the Forest, one bullet a mole rat.  Back in my day, work mattered.  These kids have no idea how easy they got it.
---
Now get off my lawn, you goddamn kids!  Martha, bring me out another Tato juice and my cane.
---
You can try to drop everything, there will be a warning about it being destroyed if dropping is not allowed.
---
I only have 3 quest-lines atm I think, ''An ounce of prevention'', ''Bureau of tourism'' and ''The new arrivals'' (which only says i need to get to lvl 20.) is it any of those?
---
At least show how much there is in your inventory when choosing a type
---
Nope but i have other mutations i dont want to supress and i had plague walker mutation by accident üòÖ so i removed it than tried symptomatic again and it worked
---
I wouldn't mind more perk cards, but honestly there could be a ton more useful thing they could put in place, I think if rather just have more lunchboxes even, I dont need stim packs, roadways, rad x, or especially alchohol that makes you teleport after a fight.
---
Frankly the professional alcoholic perk needs an additional effect to make nukashine stop causing blackouts.
---
I always drop unused ammo exept .45 and .556 those go in my vendor
---
I've been running it for three months straight now and through practical use as a Rifleman I've noticed a HUGE damage increase with my 150%+ Crit buffs. Today's discovery with the Vegetables has me near 200% and on earl I'm going from 86-173 regular hits to about 400-500 per shot with my handmade.  
---
On Earle that is HUGE for a handmade.

Couldn't find the original post (think it got removed)

Go on YouTube find out how to transfer items between characters you'll have to make new characters first but it's relatively easy tried with junk weapons first
---
Not worth it, just get rid of the shit and put on the Ammo legendary perk with Ammosmith normal perk and go farm lead for ten minutes. You'll get over 1000 rounds of whatever you need.
---
Play with different character and trade duplicated items - I play with all 5, usually have 1/5 without rare reward, but it was enough to trade all the duplicates for missing plans/outfits. And get untradable War Glaive plan for both mules instead of playing characters :(
---
I‚Äôm sure it works a little bit, but the cap sinnks can‚Äôt possibly keep up with the sheer number of caps pouring into the system. Maybe if non-player vendors had better pricing that would help because then we would spend tabs on consumables. But otherwise, the level of taxes isn‚Äôt enough to fully combat it. Which is why we have inflation. Which is why we have cap limits.
---
They also could do what our alternative Pip Boy menu is. You know how you can look at your Pipboy? Or the screen can just pop up on your screen. Just do that. Have us access the computer, and then just have the fucking interface pop up on the screen.
---
This gap is in so many games and it pisses me off! I'll protest for this change
---
What the fuck d o you mean hepushed you into an open fire stove?? What the fuck.
---
I'm not sure if mine was an off chance or not, but when I moved my camp earlier this week my Deathclaw just popped into existence in my camp the moment I chucked my camp down. Again, this could be some bug or another... No idea.
---
That would be great except for the fact claiming workshops is sometimes part of the dailies. I claimed a free and clear shop this weekend. Setup defenses and played the defend event. After it was done I was checking the map to see where I wanted to go next. Suddenly I am one shotted by some a-hole stealth with a laser Gatling. I would have happily given him the base not to lose my junk. There needs to be some kind of challenge system. Where someone can drop a gauntlet as it were. Either fight me for it or leave. I also would like to see something where when you leave a workshop you can release it so people know you are done with it.
---
Yeah, the bug zapper, the televisions, all reflective surfaces, except the elegant mirror I think, have pre-mapped landscape reflections
---
Here i am with fireproof thinking it's enough.
---
Sounds like it may be a feature not a bug
---
Claim the workshop for the daily and leave it. There's much easier ways to get junk than hanging out at a workshop
---
I found the same thing last season. I also had a spreadsheet where I track my daily progress, but I didn't notice the discrepancy until I was rank 56 and had to work backwards to find the discontinuity. The end result is that the season actually required 221475 SCORE to finish instead of 220275.

You only get like 6 extras, then look away from the pump/sink, turn back, and repeat the process.
---
If I pull a handmade or a prefix I like I blow the whole 1k but normally buy 20 modules for the ss grind but I have a full unyielding set so just 3 star range
---
I was leaving. I just had not stepped out of ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù but lesson learned. Of course he could have done the same thing during my defend event. If not for the dailies I‚Äôd rarely claim a shop.
---
Yes! I dont think its a bug too :)
---
Yeah...the Wendigo Spawn are not classified as ‚Äúglowing enemies.‚Äù
---
A "Toggle Backpack" button would actually be pretty cool.
---
I'd like to have it equipped but not visible on certain outfits, Vice-versa for others.
---
id take ammo points over useless ammo anytime, saves me time spent in this trash ui
---
I definitely agree! Also, why can't we toggle the backpack appearance altogether? The Silver Shroud should not wear a backpack lol
---
Maybe they are busy redoing their builds or levelling up a different character. 
---
Prior to the latest patch, my main was a bloodied rifleman. I did not have all my perks perfected / the best weapons / "magic" weapons. I typically could still relieve the wendigos of their lives in 1-2 hits and did about 400-600 points of damage per hit on Earle. I was fine with that... I wasn't trying to solo Earle and was content with feeling like I was providing some useful wendigo removal services. 
---
After the patch, I did about 40-50 points of damage per hit on Earle. Wendigos became hit &amp; miss, sometimes taking as many as 5-6 shots. 
---
Nothing else has changed about my play style, weapons, etc. 
---
So now I'm in the process of redoing my perks. I like being a sniper but it's no longer possible without many more defensive perks. I'm trying out revenant / mysterious savior combo currently. 
---
I've gone back to a junkie character I started and then ignored for many months. She's a lot easier because I haven't figured out how to reliably have my bloodied character go down &amp; get revived vs being obliterated to the point of a forced respawn. 
---
I don't feel frustrated about changing my build around, but there are only so many hours in a day available to play and it takes time. I suspect you will see a larger audience for Earle after everyone's had time to adjust to the new patch.
---
Put 3 repair kits in his reward pool. it will make a major difference in attendance.
---
Also SBQ needs a serious rework now. It is a pissy event for the 25minutes it takes to clear the silo. More enemy waves, and at least an extra mutation phase for her since crippling and freezing is so common now.

Scorched earth is a 5 minute event now.

I can *see* that none of the photos I've taken are saved in my gallery in game, I've checked almost every folder related to 76 and I can't find anything :(
---
Just beware that Plague walkers trait is that you'll never lose Diseases as it utilises them for the damage Aura.
---
Interior is about 4, exterior probably 3x3 or 4x4
---
Pulled a suppressor explosive fixer last night oddly it did about 15 less damage that the one I was using.oh well
---
 Why are you in drag running your power armor perks?
---
Yeah I just really do it any time the option appears most time im visiting camps. Mostly not thinking and just more inventory checking lol. I always do loot drops on lower level camps also.
---
Yeah I'm a bit confused aswell and english is my first language. That doesn't mean I'm good at it tho.
---
In my experience 5.56, .45, .50 and 5mm always sell within a session or two.
---
Yeah I'm also wondering. Gonna save this post to see if anything happens from this.
---
Arent vendors inventories instanced for each player, or is that only some of them? Always thought it was dumb as an MMO the vendors can only have 1 player interact at once.
---
For player vending machines it makes sense, sure, since its limited stock. Every time I try to go to a vendor bot at a train station someone sprints over to stare at its inventory for a few hours before 8 can get there. While I sit waiting to sell off stuff to be able to fast travel again.
---
Depends what you sell it for... I buy gauss rifle ammo anytime I see it for 1 cap per round maybe 2... other than 1 cap per round i usually move on.
---
I agree I probably get more ‚Äústuff‚Äù now during the season than I did when it was just challenges.
---
My black diamond with spikes is taking down boys easy rn. Level 48
---
When a glitch is *alleged*, especially one that is not independently reproducible we require evidence. 
---
Produce your evidence.
---
Best to do it on a private server (to avoid other players taking your stuff). Find a container, ideally with no weight limit (should show ‚Äú0/0‚Äù in the corner). Personally I use the cabinet immediately on the left as you enter Whitespring train station. It‚Äôs a good location and easy to FT to. Put items you want to transfer into the container. Log out and then log back using your Alt. You need to log back in before the server resets, which I think is within 5 minutes. Your Alt will find the stashed loot in the container. Only risk is if you lose internet connection while transferring and the server resets. Also be careful not to accidentally log back in to a public server as that also resets your private server and you‚Äôll lose your stuff.
---
You‚Äôre *claiming* a glitch occurred that none of us can reproduce. 
---
And now you‚Äôre claiming it‚Äôs a glitch instead of how it was designed. 
---
Show your evidence.
---
Yeah even before One Wasteland this was not the easiest event. I can't imagine how horrifying it is now. That damn faux sheepsquatch does Fallout 4 Assaultron level damage meaning it basically melts you once the laser strikes while its melee is like getting hit by a damn yaoi gaui where you find, at best 1/3, of your health gone from one strike.
---
What about the lack of exit button? (Xbox) go through all the menus do your conversions then the only back button is the "back to ammo select" hit back again and it takes you "back" to your last transaction... Endless loop of fury...
---
I didn‚Äôt even know what the hell was going on I was getting shredded along with everyone else lol, first time ever doing that event, seeing it or even hearing of it. And I did it completely oblivious to what I was walking into lol
---
VATS and Sneak/Sneak Attacks at the moment appear to be in a fragile state. 
---
I'm sure it'll be one of the next fixes aside from the Bench-press as there's been a lot of complaints about it.
---
Upvoted üëç
---
My heavy guns are really durable, so doing SBQs gives you 2-3 of those improved ones, but I only use like 1 repair kit every 2 or 3 SBQs.
---
Not to mention the things cloaked almost the entire fucking time lol you don‚Äôt even know where the hell it is
---
Please share the test results. Thanks.
---
Bullion is seemingly going to be used for past season items and newer armors/weapons so they won't see a relevancy issue there. Still would be nice for some more options for perk coins. Hell, I would just like to see an option to get coins directly from leveling instead of needing to pick cards to scrap.
---
Most of us higher level players (especially us with Fallout 1st, where we have near endless building materials) will often drop resources at a damaged camp, particularly if they're lower levels or fix what we can
---
Yesterday I've done it solo with my mule equipped only with IE Pump shotgun 7:21 - 3 advices:
---
\- learn the map and shortest way between all 4 crucial points (first broken radio, 2 uplinks, boss location
---
\- don't fight anything between each crucial points - just run as fast ignoring all enemies.
---
\- when boss spawns focus on him only, ignore other enemies surrounding him - you can kill then after him when timer stops.
---
Get addictions and use Junkies
---
I‚Äôm intrigued how Dow you ‚Äòtinker‚Äô with the flamer ? Thanks
---
For daily ops? There's not.
---
ü§Ø
---
I do, Just wasn‚Äôt sure if my junkies is the better option.
---
Line of sight them.
---
If you didn‚Äôt have an over-powered one-shot kill tank-god build before Patch 22, you don‚Äôt have an over-powered one-shot kill tank-god build now.
---
Am I too late with this finding?
---
Same here. One spec ops mask, and two vault 94 jumpsuit plans.
---
Yes, welcome to June 2020
---
You mean, literally like the game tells you in the ‚Äòeducational video‚Äô you come across as part of the questline you have to complete before you even get to start the Vault 79 Raid prep with either the Settlers or Raiders. 
---
Like that?
---
Nope, just noticed now so thanks for telling me, never thought it would use an  element number to name the vault that has gold
---
You are the mass murder.  You started killing long before Ward came along.
---
Yes it is why it has this number. The game tells you this in the presentation you watch at a point during the questline.
---
i circumvent that problem by backing out of the screen of successful transaction, then back in, means you only have a couple of screens to get out of the damn thing instead of the approx 50,000 screens doing it the normal way
---
Yep with rank 1 you can wear the Chinese Stealth suit and sustain zero rads. Awesome. I‚Äôm thinking that I no longer need a rad shower.
---
Welp I just didn't watch the video kuz I thought it was kinda boring
---
To be fair on the games part I've only done about 4 daily Ops I haven't really had the time to really get into it I would kind of like to see about getting a group together to Maybe Bang out 10 of them since it only takes about 6 and a 1/2 minutes to do one
---
Yup. Modules.
---
I mean it just looks kinda cool but tbh it‚Äôs somewhat bland, and pretty tight quarters inside. I don‚Äôt think there is an active door on it either, which I did not like. It‚Äôs perfectly sized for 2 vending machines on left and right wall (2 on each wall, 4 total) and a stash box. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how the other placeable pre builds work, but when it‚Äôs powered there no interior lighting and it‚Äôs kind of wonky getting wires inside for the vending machines. 5/10 imo, but I also am not a big fan of the prebuilt structures, I‚Äôd rather free build.
---
Yeah but you can only earn the rare rewards once per day..
---
It‚Äôs how you tell how old a server is.
---
Junkies build is pretty good if not specialize with a gun and find an anti armor version of it
---
If you want max damage go bloodied. If not junkies has good damage. Also Commando and heavy gunner seem to be the best type of weapons to use
---
To start that questline you have to go to the abandoned waste dump.
---
500 gold bullion per card pack so it convert at 500 for 10 perk coin? Is that fair
---
I had a feeling that was the case. 
---
Usually when a game takes the time to present a concentrated information dump, that‚Äôs when you really need to listen and pay attention. 
---
It‚Äôs one thing to miss a reference in a terminal as you‚Äôre clicking through. It‚Äôs another when the game hands you information on a platter. 
---
Hell, The Overseer shushes you if you try to talk to her while the video is playing. 
---
But, I get it might have felt boring.
---
Not sure how it is on the normal robot vendors but Grahm and the Responder Vendor Bot are instanced.
---
if you got a friend that holds them for you, you can hop in and out of the server to refresh the inventory.  
---
Also Spoiler, i was on discord with all of those people.
---
I feel the same way myself. Kinda reminds me of the NCR Ranger armour from Fallout NV (as well as from here I guess, with Fallout 1st..) 
---
While I enjoy the whole outfit, looks just as good without the headpiece. Specially with some nice sunglasses.. Plus it kinda helps that headpiece/outfit aren't always rewarded at the same time.. So plenty of time to get use to the outfit without it.
---
Thanks for this info
---
Yeah ignore that tool. It‚Äôs known to be misleading.
---
Do a beserker non-stealth melee build and fight a behemoth.
---

---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it.
---
I would still work through them if I were you
---
Since I only got the outfit so far, I‚Äôve been substituting the helmet with the raider pathfinder mask and medical goggles. Looks super tacticool and honestly I kinda prefer that over the BOS mask. Plus it actually does cover the neck as well üëÄ
---
Umm I'm level 48 and don't really know all my card data like most. I just build to make myself as viable as possible in the wastes. But I just have to run a pump shot, 10mm sub, and it changes from sniper or the fixer. The fixer is an absolutely wonderful gun for me it takes most non heavys down with 3 and half shots that's with silencer. Also my black diamond with blades is absolutely bonkers too. It takes down charred in two heavy and 1 light hits, and scorched even less. But I'm a low level so.
---
Theres my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it
---
It‚Äôs not that good tbh
---
Not sure if it would be enough, but they could try to use the Brotherhood under armor to maybe hide the gap a bit.
---
I know but the more times that you run it the better the chances are of getting . I had one time where in 2 in 1 day and didn't get any rare rewards and it was after my reset because I got the elder Kier I just didn't get anything.
---
Have you completed all the quests under the main tab? I would start there.
---
For what? A nuke? Sheesh.
---
I run bloodied sneak commando. It works well in most situations but in daily ops I have to change up my play style a bit. Instead of bloodied weapons I switch to vampires and I increase my hp to about 50%
---
Almost done.  I thought saving it would be the best. I just wasn't too sure because it's been an objective for so long.
---
Thank you.
---
When I get greenhouse walls I might make a reactor room with a little window, sounds more like a decoration than anything.
---
While there are those who would argue it's not worth ranking up past 1, I'm in the R4 category as the sheer utility and survivability it offers is worth it as a full health build.
---
I've not tried it in Radiation Rumble yet, but I launched a nuke last night and spent about 6 minutes in the rad zone after the Queen was defeated. In my T-65, I never gained any rads and had absolutely no thoughts or need for radaway while in there.
---
I agree. Plus, all these loot pets and loot vacuum ideas just seem so lazy lol just go loot the body. A perk or pet doesn't need to do it for you.
---
I always have a pair in my vending machine. They sell fairly regularly.
---
You still get destroyed in radiation Rumble real real quick. It's the only reason I still carry some diluted radaway.
---
I don‚Äôt understand?  You can‚Äôt equip an outfit with that armor?
---
I‚Äôm ok with this
---
Stay near the entrance to wait for other players. The timer only starts when you're a certain distance to the door.
---
You can, its just don't get why we can't use a scout armor skin for it.
---
2mm post WL, 5mm usually (less so after legendary ammo perks). Lots of market for ultracite 45, 50 and 5mm
---
I will buy .45 and 5.56 every time I see it for sale. Even if they are selling for 2 caps.
---
Just remember when folks say "Bloodied build" they're literally referring to a single weapon with a single perk. 
---
AA
---
Two-Shot
---
Vampires
---
Junkies
---
These are also good, just because you don't have a weapon with Bloodied doesn't mean you can't still utilise half the Buffs Bloodied users have. 
---
The only upside to all the low HP buffs with Bloodied weapons is they compliment each other.
---
You could be an Adrenal Reaction Beserkers if you really wanted, or Junkies, Or vamps etc etc. 
---
(Vamp would actually be alright with the whole low HP thing if you regulate your HP with RADS, since Vamps will keep you touching the Rad bar with your HP)
---
Whats the story with these daily ops? I just started playing this game and I see that, but I figure im too low a level to play them
---
also.
---
if you add 7 and 9 together you get 16. And if you add 1 and 6 together you get 7. 
---
What is the 7th letter of the alphabet? G. Gold starts with G. 
---
Coincidence? Yes. Absolutely
---
Which is not true. I run plague walker and constantly have to eat raw and and spoiled food and drink dirty water to get new diseases because they constantly wear off.
---
Now tell me what atomic number Ultracite has?
---
I agree with you, just started playing this game before this update and it was fun. Now everything is a grind and im constantly out of mats and ammo. It would be nice to have lower level places to grind out mats and not waste all your ammo.
---
If your strength is high enough you can send them back to Crater alive. 
---
You don't get that option with Ward. They're always killed.
---
Edit: Forgot a letter.
---
Friend of mine had the same problem in a different game when it came to pvp sniping. He upgraded his tv and now when we play games together he can see things I can't. I know that's kind of an expensive way to remedy that problem but it worked for him.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt get rid of Starched Genes 2, personally. But it means I can dump off all my Rad-X and carry just a handful of RadAway.
---
Pretty sure you are right, everytime you take rads there is a chance for mutation. Its not how much rads you take at once.
---
Its possible to finish at around 6-7 minutes doing it solo.  
---
Ignore the enemys as much as you can and memorize the shortest walkways between objectives.
---
Vampires effect at low health has been my go to on daily ops.run no  power armour perks aside the legendary one that recharges..I feel like Schwarzenegger in T2 just insane.
---
Can deathclaws come from Deathclaw Island?
---
Well then it's definitely bugged, since the trait literally is not meant to allow you to lose diseases.
---
The door is a separate object under the 'Doors' category on the CAMP screen, at the very end of the first selection, that will snap to the Field Station when placed - if that's what you meant!
---
You do realize most of the cosmetics go _over_ armor, right?

---
Good thinking. If it‚Äôs like regular super mutants with mini guns, they just try hitting you and backing up. 
---
Fucker likes to one-shot me.
---
Yeah, you can drop them in stacks with the same "You can't drop these" prompt one-time. Still takes the same amount like everything else, the 5/6 or whatever it is.
---
It‚Äôs a thing in Fallout 4 too.
---
&gt; if so one run through luck hole mine can yield you over 1000 lead
---
I must be missing something then. Even with Excavator and spending an hour painstakingly making sure I grab every node I only end up with 400 max. 
---
Really wish the worthless crystal nodes were a different color.
---
i think thats the case, laserrifles/pistols that previously didnt penetrate armor all that well are now way more usable too
---
I have a generic Fixer and an explosive Handmade with all the commando perks and I can easily do all content. ‚ÄúStack the damage perks for the gun you like‚Äù is a viable build
---
And by the by, it's all about Elizium.
---
100% toxin and gas proof. His neck wards it off.
---
My wife wants them irl. We have a mini nuke, nuka Quantum, bobbleheads, lunchbox, and a bunch of other fo swag. Sell some plushies.
---
Got nothing twice and the rest I've got duplicate plans two glaves and two caged lights.
---
No way! I actually did that last night looking for it and couldn‚Äôt find it. That‚Äôs dope, thank you!
---
Do you really think they‚Äôll fix that? They haven‚Äôt even fixed a literally game breaking quest bug that stops you progressing past loading in the blood sample.
---
Start a new character, the grind to lvl 20 is now harder than anything in the old system, you‚Äôll get ruined by a mole rat swarm lol
---
Sometimes I see people using the fatman to tag in events. Splash damage lets you get a large number of tags fairly efficiently. They are great for 'fireworks' in events like fasnacht (seriously, the people who do this at fasnacht are awesome!!).  
---
I haven't see anyone use one as an actual useful weapon though.
---
I thought crit damage is capped ? Eagle eyes already gives 40% more crit damage
---
There supposed to be a way to trigger it again since the latest patch, not sure how is works though.
---
From what I understand there is a quest that guides you through launching a nuke, however it may autocomplete if someone on your team launches a nuke according to posts here, so you may want to avoid teams once you get it.  Im working my way through the questline. 
---
The main questline leads you to the abandoned waste dump, eventually, and i dont know what the requirements to start that quest is. So you might want to continue the quest you have.
---
I think it's right before Unobtanium on the chart.
---
Be me: yo, why am I hundreds of lbs overweight in my EXC PA? *checks Aid tab*
---
55 Stimpack Super, 140 Stimpack, and some 50 radaway
---
That shit weighs too much in PA without the chem backpack.
---
It‚Äôs a outfit. I will check later on and see what it comes out as
---
That's how they wipe. It's like the 3 sea shells but a bit more bloody.
---
Last night I did heart of the swamp, feed the people, swarm of suitors, lode baring and Uranium Fever and there were randoms at every one of those
---
I roll all the 3 star ranged weapons I can, add a random to group or call a friend in and let them deal with the mess. 
---
Probably dropped so many god rolls by now, but it's gotten to the point where I don't really want to even look.
---
I have what I want, now it's time to throw guns at people in an aggressive, but "giving" manner. 
---
(One might say, I Aggressively give you a gun to the head, in the literal sense). 
---
"Hey you! Yeah you! Gotcha now! Touch my Bag! Take it all!! TAKE IT ALL!!!!"
---
I know, thats why i suggest 10 for 100 gold, its just a little boost. Or give like 25 per Perk Pack every 5 levels. Makes lunch boxes even better.
---
That one guy in the Bethesda trailers is always using it
---
L
---
If there were no dupes I bet your ass you‚Äôd be using something other than that super duper legacy VBJE25402515 gat plas.
---
If you're a Bloodied/Unyielding player that perk is your bane. Would mean you can't use Vampire alt weps or stims. Big ol' rip, honestly.
---
Oh yeah this one backed right into a corner just slapping me with his RPG. I was almost to 7mins on the clock just jamming the Handmade into his face screaming out *die you fucker* and realised he'd stopped shooting altogether. literally he didn't get another volley off for the remainder of the fight.
---
Defs a mechanic I'll be using moving forward.
---
Will the survival syringe remove mutations? If not then one could strip the starched genes card more better stuff
---
There is a timer- about 4 minutes.  You won‚Äôt get rewards if it runs out.
---
I run heavy weapons + commando on the same character. Maxed out both for max dmg. Means just stripping down some QoL perks but other than that fits perectly.
---
Just start living that Bush life man. Bush wookies!
---
Did not notice that. Will have to check in a few min, closely.
---
So, if i dont care for rewards and just want to farm the ammo? Do i get kicked after that timer or will i just not get any rewards?
---
I would but I would also just like to be in a group that I can talk to.
---
super duper too.  there is a hidden path with a bunch of nodes on it.  
---

Thinking the sameüëç
---
Nice work!
---
Is thecell I4 showing the correct value? For me it looks like a fixed value of 15 instead of a VLOOKUP formula.
---
Excellent
---
They could at least make it sexy like Radshield.
---
yesterday a high level gave me and the crew some xp boosting consumables, what a fella
---
Good question...maybe u should test it and report back
---
I take it you got it as the random drop after the Queen, not the Queen herself? Also can you trade it? I wouldn't think so since you cant trade the normal ones, but it never hurts to ask
---
How is this even a reward!? Its basically killing a ghoul in the golf course
---
I believe that's coming. Like a table in the corner of the map that will show all current events
---
Load Baring Tokens ... that explains it!!!! Thank you kind person.
---
Well now that's handy!
---
I'll try it out this evening after work. If this works ill be swimming in ultracite plasma cartridges :D
---
I suggest developing the habit of stashing your junk at every opportunity. Doing that has saved me a lot of heartache.
---
Changing tv doesn't make the draw distance longer?
---
I joined a level 30 and he had been in Ops for 45 minutes before I jumped in and helped him.
---
am i the only one who never profits anything useful from it lol i enjoy it but the rewards i get are a huge middle finger
---
Are you on console?xbox if so I just ranked up my 2nd toon and have some pretty decent low level gear.level 15 Mutants handmade level 20 m combat rifle a few pieces of level 15 to 20 vanguard pieces I can pass down to you.lmk
---
Interesting, thank you for the info
---
I wish I could put on 2 mods on my backpack. Right now I have food and drink. Stimpacks are too damn heavy.
---
Uhh, good for you?
---
I def need this unlocked. It's the only way I can take down higher levels with legacy's
---
They also level up now, my 21 Deathclaw turned into a 100 Glowing DC
---
No it‚Äôs not hard capped, soft capped with each addition yes, but when stacked to a ridiculous amount it‚Äôs extremely noticeable.
---
Hitting regular max level super mutants in the head out of stealth with an Ultracite Laser Rifle for 1k+ per Crit activation
---
Honestly most ammo tends to get bought out in my machines. The main ones I've stopped putting up is .38, .44, and energy cells (and of course the heavy explosive ammo).  .45 ,556, 5mm, 50 cal, and EC all go as soon as I put them up. 308, shells, plasma and railways spikes go after a couple days.
---
Yeah i keep trying now im out of rsources no luck xD
---
That's where my purified water comes in. No grind, easy profits.
---
Somebody was using one yesterday at the Guided Meditation event. Was pretty funny having the voiceover talking about feeling so tranquil and relaxed right now while mininukes were going off all over the place.
---
Its ok xD
---
No my buddy crafted one for me and when he went to drop it he got the prompt you get with all the other gold bullion items.
---
That sounds decent enough. Could set up a minimalistic base with your bunk and stash inside, and a seedy shed outside with some work benches.
---
Yeah im jumping station to station and player vendors trying to find or see if they sell the mod lol
---
thank you for this, I've been trying a while and as of patch 21 hadn't even been able to get the tame menu item to appear. 
---
So from what I understand, just equip WW or AF at whatever level you have either of those and I'm good, as long as it's a truly random encounter?
---
Possibly I never got close enough, I didn't know if you saw pacify but not tame in the menu, that could mean you weren't close.
---
That would be perfect. I used a mod up until this last patch that hid my backpack, but it also hides everyone's backpack, which doesn't really bother me but on the other hand backpacks do complement some outfits better than others.
---
"when you do things right, people won‚Äôt be sure you‚Äôve done anything at all"
---
Im running EE,
---
Weapons have 50% Vats Crit 
---
Got the Vats Crit damage Luck perk maxed 
---
Use every single Crit buff I can 
---
The damage on Earle is stupid even with each spacebar I‚Äôm getting enormous amounts of damage compared to base. 
---
It‚Äôs essentially still acting as a multiplier with the crits
---
Purely for banter ü§£
---
I dont know how many materials it takes to make and scrap Tesla's to learn the mods..seems like that will be to only way I just hope it's not like the radium rifle I've made 100s and havent unlocked the silencer still
---
I have an explosives character that mostly sits in hibernation until Bethesda decides to do something about the state of those weapons. The biggest issue is durability as explosives break ridiculously quickly. Also the amount of explosive DR enemies have, especially endgame bosses, makes them pointless.
---
Same, they seem to have changed them in the patch to only drop mutant hound meat. Sad change for me, I used to get excited to come across them.
---
I second this, but I would prefer if it sounded like the jukebox in the garden area in vault 51. Smooth. Jazz. 
---
Wish that i got a fixer plan out of that event.
---
You haven't finished the quest to graduate from tadpole yet. You need 3 tadpole badges, a revive, and a couple other things. Finish that quest, then the possum badges will unlock.
---
If you dont have that quest yet, check posters at train stations, i think the scout camp quest is one of them.
---
I have a friend who launches two shot mini nukes into whitespring a parking lots. Bug boom.
---
I know you can't trade the crafted version. Just wanted to see if it was any different with a legendary one (I wouldn't think you can, but I like to be sure)
---
They should just buff it and maybe make the cost requirement cheaper, grenades don‚Äôt get used much anyway.
---
honey and honeycomb provide a similar, but lesser effect, I believe.
---
... hi Mark.
---
I have an instigating Farman.  At level 125 i brought it in to the cloaked blood eagles daily ops and...it actually worked well. Maybe I didn‚Äôt give them a fair enough chance. Going to try pulling some of them out here and there to use
---
I have maxed out demolition expert so sometimes I'll pick up a fat man and head for whitesprings. It's fun to send ghouls rag dolling across the map for a few minutes until the weapon inevitably breaks itself.
---
It's Count Orlok. Run!
---
I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôd go with a Commando build, but I can say with certainty after the damage calculation change to do with Rifleman, it seems the Crits per shot are a dramatic increase to anything else I‚Äôve used with rifleman. 
---
I‚Äôm sure Crits aren‚Äôt all that on commando, you‚Äôd probably go 25% FFR for that
---
Somehow tame option does not appear even when i am very very close.
---
Demon arch?
---
I have never hd this issue with rendering. I‚Äôm actually amazed at how far it renders in this game compared to FO4 which was garbage down a scope. 
---
If you‚Äôre on pc- could be something with your specs. Interestingly enough, no issues on Xbox for me.
---
If you use the legendry perk survival shortcut, survival syringes will also heal you for more than a stimpak which can be very useful.
---
Lots of ingame reflections still use that!
---
Cool. Hadn't realised !
---
Legendary items with multiple stars lag it as well. So if your storing a lot you don't use very often I'd suggest getting a mule to hold some.
---
Essential the more different types of things in inventory and stash the more lag you have cause the game has to scan it all.
---
I‚Äôve been able to clean up the bodies in the time frame. After the boss dies all you have is cleanup of the leftover living enemies. So if you want to farm best way is to just not even kill the boss
---
but then how would they make money from their atom shop?
---
And spend 15 min looking for salvage
---
I swapped to the chem weight, with survival shortcut i got rid of all food and water i had, i dont need them anymore.
---
Sounds like you and I have similar builds. Yes, right after the patch things were bad. I might as well had a pea shooter ( hey there‚Äôs an idea).  But playing this weekend was fun again and my weapon, every now and then, with a good headshot can sometimes one shot a 50 mutant or scorched. VATS is still jacked but I try not to use it anyway. More satisfying for me to scope up and take the shot on my own. 
---
I won‚Äôt agree that we should not complain, I think it just needs to be constructive and not a total rant. If we did not Beth might not know there are issues. 
---
Anyway happy guys with our builds are once again enjoying the game. Hope to see you around Appalachia. üôÇ
---
Two shot has always had a rough accuracy penalty like that, only really usable against big targets!
---
The good news is if you can get some, armor that triggers the magic bug, it treats two shot weapons the same way it does shotguns! Making the bullets home in on torso VATS shots.
---
You made my day sir
---
Nice pic!
---
Well uranium is 92 so maybe the more radioactive numbers have relevance to some of th4 vaults?
---
Wonder what is build is?
---
I use chem weight reduction armor, since it affects good and chems.
---
I‚Äôm currently running a power armor build. T-51b.  If i want to conserve ammo i use my cursed shovel. If I want thing dead fast i use my Two shot, faster fire rate, faster reload ultra cute gattling laser
---
Dont worry about it, I only realised there was a guy selling bullion in the way fairer the other day.
---
Yeah, that's annoying. I wish they'd auto-activate like the "Claim Workshop" quests always seem to.
---
Wrong can drop and pick up now just did 50 doing another 225 and with lunchboxes and stacked do you get an insane amount!
---
4Head build
---
Scroll around in the tabs. If it's a couch, it will be with the other couches. If it's a table it will be in with the tables.
---
I can't even give 5mm away at the moment. (I literally have free bundles in my vendor)
---
As soon as we get camp Interior spaces/basements, I'm totally recreating [Don Hell's](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/venturebrothers/images/8/88/Don_Hell%27s_Exterior.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20170320025036) club from Venture Brothers with the BoS Field Station.
---
This was my first one! Looking forward to many more :)
---
I would rather remove one of the commando temporary and have Glow sight and tank killer.
---
And to be fair to the holotapes, the Order of Mysteries questline is one of the best in the franchise and it‚Äôs all terminal entries and holotapes.
---
Not from what I‚Äôve seen. Hold A on the thing. Don‚Äôt stay too far away. Kill waves. Kill boss who doesn‚Äôt do anything different than the other guys. Leave. It‚Äôs a nice addition but hardly anything to praise
---
yeah, i came back to delete my post.  i wandered away from the tests for a bit, killed off and cooked a few mirelurks and tried again.  This time 5/5.
---
Hey if you're able to please respond or update your post to let us know you are okay.
---
Figured this was known already, but yeah, that's not cool don't do that. I pretty much don't do ACP anymore anyways as it feels like a massive waste but floating goo piles in SBQ is annoying as hell.
---
It points directly down for me, kinda weird
---
I was traded a be90 50 cal, didn't realize it had scattering on it until the next day. (Minigun life) 900 something energy damage. Yeah it fucking shreds but it's not what I traded for so I'm a little upset. I start up a daily ops group and run people threw until I have to go to bed. If there was a way to pull scattering from it I would as it mostly just gets myself killed. Minigun is much more satisfying and I hope the brother brings the other cannon minigun with them.
---
I personally think if they just raise the base weapon damage of every gun by 25% it‚Äôd not only save time, but potential bugs to do with this.
---
I mean, they literally changed the damage calculations for ease of balance changes (hint hint, base values upped by 25% literally won‚Äôt cause an issue)
---
and with the amount of folk I‚Äôve seen saying how critters and basic animals aren‚Äôt taking enough of it, well imo it‚Äôd make sense just to raise all weapon base damage by... you guessed it! 25%!!
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be too much, since most guns are ranging from 80-220 damage as it is, but it‚Äôll help the little guys that don‚Äôt have big ammo stocks, or lots of resources
---
Do daily ops solo without using power armor or enemy specific armor.  Plenty of challenge there and the end boss will mess you up.
---
Pretty easy though once you change up your armor.
---
I have a bed, stash box, scrap box, weight bench, shooting gallery, train set and a deathclaw rug in mine. Its great
---
"raider pathfinder mask and medical goggles"
---
Such a good combo!  I wear this with my stealth suit.
---
I actually need repair kits really bad my explosive gatling gun, laser, and explosive gatling plasma durability runs down so fast.
---
If you have a variety of couches. You‚Äôll just scroll they those until you come across the one you bought.  It‚Äôll have the atom shop symbol
---
I feel you. When the other players enter your draw distance area, they just appear out of thin air like ghost üòÖ.
---
They are not properly social distancing,  but at least they have their masks on.
---
Yeah, random drop from the event, queen has a plasma rifle or something
---
That does sound pretty sweet! Back to the grind...
---
You'd think a dedicated mining machine would have optimal searchlights for deep earth ore extraction etc. But no, that's not even on their radar when every other suit has silly shit like 'Vaultboy Headlamp'.
---
This is potentially really insensitive... its also fucking hysterical
---
Unfortunately it's the fastest way to level up as well.  Wish they would tweak xp to make actually playing as rewarding as being afk.
---
Tried to list in my vendor, didnt work.
---
Also goes excellent with the insurgent outfit üëå
---
The resource drain of daily ops is unreal. I have lvl 50 3\* furious, explosive  assault rifle with 500 rounds at lvl 84 with  30% automatic weapon dmg and psychotats and I saved that for the assaultron boss two nights ago. Maybe took off a quarter of its HP dying over and over and still probably landing 80% of my rounds. Maxed T60 power armor lost half its durability.  I completely missed any of the time targets (19min, I was at 11 before the boss fight). The only reason I finished at all was because the AI glitched and stopped attacking because I spawned right on top of the assaultron and immediatly started slashing at it. even that , blocking it into a corner getting nonstop hits and crits with a 180 dmg miner gauntlet it took forever. SO MAYBE just MAYBE balance these missions to scale to the player. Pretty please. The rewards are a joke for that kind of investment.
---
On a side note, why is it so easy to find t45, t51, and even x01 mods and plans but almost nothing for T60. That's my all time favorite PA and it gets no love.
---
The comment clearly meant they have five weapons in their favourite's wheel, jumping to conclusions much?
---
Not only is follow through not working, sneak attacks all together aren't working. I'm doing the same damage in sneak headshots than I do standing up! My commando has just give  up on sneak perks this patch and gone run and gun instead because sneak no longer matters....
---
as i said to the guy complaining about ammo rewards... just drop them somewhere well traveled for some n00bs.
---
like i get it, vendor trash as a reward is jank, but jank for you might not be jank for another player.  my mutant's black powder pistol with +10% ads damage and +10% vats damage is utter garbage to most players.  it's my most prized weapon cause it is the only three star black powder pistol i've been able to get that wasn't complete garbage.
---
same goes for radaways.  a lot of early level players need them.  until i had sun kissed rank 2 radaway and radx were my only defense against rads.  
---
just vendor trash them, be grateful for the caps, and worst case, just pass them on cause i'm pretty sure every single player in this game has at one time or another found something they needed or wanted just lying on the floor in a train station or outside of vault 76.
---
I want backpacks to have straps and not float inches from my character back. I use the scabbers and shell shocked as they look OK with the raider scabber outfit.
---
I definitely dont need anymore repair kits lol, i'd settle for picking my reward out of a group of options.
---
Maybe after the nerf but not sure if tank killer gives 30%
---
5.56 I'll buy every time. Only 1 cap tho. Don't need to be ripped off.
---
I did the math a while back, you get 2 coins per card you turn in, and it takes 300 coins to max out a perk card since they start at rank 1 when equipped. So that being said that means 300 coins per card, 6 slots, for a full set of cards that means you will need a minimum of 1800 perk coins total, but you halve that when talking about perk cards since each card gives 2 coins, meaning 900 cards or 900 straight levels for a full set, this ofcourse doesn't factor in the fact that you need to keep some of your cards to be efficient, the 50 coins for hitting level 50, or the perk card packs. Theoretically you might be able to get a full set of 6 cards before level 900, or well after if you are hoarding your perk cards.
---
Yeah it's a bit of a grind, but personally from my point of view from a day 1 casual player, with spotty attendance, just over 1000 hours played and a level 203 on my main, that works a full time job. I don't think it is really too bad personally. Though I would like more perk pack though, if only for the dad jokes and bubblegum.
---
You know what, I find it difficult to argue with that assessment.
---
I think its pretty much the same but under time pressure it doesnt take much to get disorientated or take a wrong term or like I did in one today - brain fart on where to go next and panic when I couldnt find the right doorway
---
I too am a moisture farmer
---
It‚Äôs not that I / we don‚Äôt believe you, but that‚Äôs still no proof. Just another story - true or not.
---
\&gt;  Guerilla/Gunslinger  
---
all ballistic ammo using weapons should have their perks in perception.  it doesn't take extra strength to aim a shotgun, for instance.  One should not have to reallocate special points to switch from pistols to rifles to shotguns.  I can see changing your perk cards, but not special points.   Especially now in the era of legendary perks, where 9 levels means changing your perk cards + up to 9 special point moves and/or the loss of many perk coins.
---
Moist.
---
You just have shit luck and they haven't been out long at all. You'll be ok
---
Agreed... There's always one over by the Big Blood Eagles Fort: Crimson Dong or whatever it's called - in the Cranberry Bog.  Usually pick it up to chase the Dogs around there.  The Dogs ended up chasing me instead as of Snatch 22.
---
why are they the only bullion item you can find in the wild - like either lemme find gauss and secret service without the plans or remove the grenades- ya cant have it both ways
---
Get a Junkie's or Anti-Armor weapon and stack all the relevant perks.
---
Many perks can be kept aside until needed - Picklock, Hacker, Science, super duper, ammosmith, etc.  
---
Recall that a key benefit of the low-health build is *Unyielding Armor*.  That intelligence bonus is very helpful for all the levels needed for legendary perks and coins.  Personally, I stack Herd Mentality, Herbivore, Strange in Numbers, and make Brain Bombs.  You can swap in Carnivore and Scorchbeast Brain if you are melee.
---
You're not almost done if you have no idea how to launch a nuke.
---
I'll smoke a bowl for ya!
---
I truly don‚Äôt get what they were thinking.  They clearly based these grenades on the nukaquantum grenade which is the least useful explosive in the game.
---
I thought It was 6 or something. I just stack till 8 at this point
---
But it doesn‚Äôt specify they‚Äôre not all different E plasmas. It‚Äôs actually pretty vague, but I took the context I have and assumed he had 5 BE Gatling plasmas. If you have a god roll or legacy, odds are it‚Äôs duped unless you rolled it yourself and let‚Äôs face it, you probably didn‚Äôt.
---
I think they just need a larger radius
---
Magic armor, I've seen it mentioned, my only magic item is a mini gun that can melt Earl and the queen, I stress in my private world, not pissing of public servers.
---
I will now do some hunting and find out what the effects are to be magic. Thanks for the prompt on that one üëç
---
It's weird how easy all the ops are... Until the robots show up, then the robots instantly swarm you, don't care about what armor you wear and you can't sneak.
---
And even if you can dodge the armor peircing Gutsies, if they're slowdown robots robobrains become the new priority target because they don't even need to hit you to slow you down!
---
Hahaha - just spat out my coffee
---
Careful, without Starched Genes those Decontamination Arches can cure mutations.
---
I think he was a raider that got kicked out because the raiders clearly say that they only kill to survive but warm kills for fun
---
What you're looking for is any armor with a blocking legendary effect, this turns any shotgun, Heavy gun and two shot weapon into a magic weapon!
---
Strangely enough the nerf has actually made magic damage more powerful.
---
OMG I have 9 Orbital Strike and 1 Orbital Scan and I never use them üòÇ I need to reconsider this
---
I always assumed it was just an old description. For it to do anything you have to have a disease and that's the down side
---
And interesting about two shot being dodgy with smaller enemies, I'll go test on larger ones and see what happens. It's a cute little gun and want to keep it, first 10mm I've messed with.
---

---
Pretty bog standard PA heavy weapons build, you can obviously play around with it (could throw on legendary Endurance and rack points into life giver and just be even more tanky) but it should be pretty usable
---
The mirror ball plan sells really quick for around 2.5k caps.
---
Havoc for the body,  Jonesy for the face
---
It's always been like this since B.E.T.A, however some patches are worse than others, as VATS as a whole has been nuffed and nerfed a lot over the years.
---
You've got some work to do on your build and gear then, bud. Run with some other people.
---
PC unfortunately. I'll complete it one day I suppose lol
---
I've seen less people since the update. I can see how it turned people off from the game tho. Lot don't like the scaling me included. I still play daily tho, not nearly as many playing.
---
On xbox? I'm an event fool, I'll do every event that pops up.
---
Perception/vats seems a bit borked at the moment. TS always has accuracy issues but my AA lever is struggling to hit unless I stand an inch away from the target with 17 Perception. It's a bit ridiculous that you need to buff way past max special even to hit a target.
---
I have perks for both rifle and heavy, I'm finding myself using only heavy after the update.
---
My BE handmade still does more damage than my tse handmade
---
I used a Fortnite Havoc body, and a Jonesy head.
---
Not really helpful though is it..  So thanks I guess.
---
Even funnier, I wonder if the poster is complaining about people showing up in the Tattered Dress - who are squeezing out every last advantage, as it's the one clothing item which is not purely cosmetic, but provides +1 perception.
---
Really? I'm finding them more useless, the damage is so abysmal.
---
i thought it would tbh, i want to trade someone for it but i don‚Äôt really know how to, is there anyway to trade items for items in this game at all?
---
How do you even get 110 damage?
---
Handmade has 45 base damage. Two-shot is +25%, Powerful automatic mod is \~12% plus. Do you have Adrenaline, Adrenal Reaction or Nerd Rage on?
---
Can the animal heal itself? Or can you heal it with fire friendly?
---
I'm a full health heavy weapon PA user and have never needed to use a single stimpak in Daily Ops, ACP, or SE with my Vampire Explosive Gatling Gun.
---
Oh if thats the case for this tesla rifle mod then...  Ill go insane lol
---
Its like a butter knife....  on a side note, dont eat any toast you find laying around Daggers Den.
---
You can pop up a post on a fb group or even on reddit I suppose. Be and even tse hadmades are probably two of the most sought after rifles. I had my tse drop from the purveyor and my BE handmade was given to me from a member in the brotherhood of steel group I run with. Being such a low level I don't think you'll have anything to trade unless it's a rare outfit.
---
I was very surprised how much adhesive and junk it took to make those damn radiums... worst part is I don't need the mods the gun is ok I guess..hope you find that mod you need
---
Yes over on the market one. But you will have to offer everything for one. Because ppl that have them don‚Äôt trade for caps or any regular weapon it‚Äôs gotta be god roll weapons. And this is a reason why are trading is crap on this game. Your best chance is to get a enemy to drop it or get from purveyor
---
Yes it‚Äôs been so slow
---
i mean i have a bos spec ops outfit and i‚Äôve seen people are trading be handmades for it so i just assumed i could get one for the most part
---
see a few reasons i don't believe this, 1) i rolled war glaive plan on day 1 of daily ops and ive been spinning 1 star melee weapons since without seeing 1 war glaive legendary. 2) no matter how much i fuck around with aspect ratio i can't make a glaive display as small as your tiny photoshopped image version. 3) ill go as far as saying the text, the glaive and the stat boxes were all edited onto the blurred image of your character infront of the purveyor, image taken using photomode and the depth of field options.
---
Because if that were possible, you'd see people using it to duplicate legacy or god roll legendary weapons and armor.  Agreed however that multi-user vendors should not be a problem. One might just experience a "this item is no longer available" message when they try to buy if someone else just beat them to it.
---
The damage nerf and one wasteland world change were a tough pill to swallow all at once for a lot of people.
---
Had they spaced the two changes out, even by a couple weeks, it woulda been easier for people to adjust.
---
My CAMP is in the Mire next to a Radtoad spawn, and I still get thwacked with three or so level 100 Radtoads pretty much every time I fast travel there. I have a bunch of heavy laser turrets, and that seems to be pretty effective; I don't have to rebuild structures very often.
---
oh i see ‚òπÔ∏é i have the bod spec ops outfit and i‚Äôve seen people trade it for be/tse weapons, i just don‚Äôt know how it would work at all considering it seems like someone has to go first and someone has to go second
---
Would explain the rubberbanding health.
---
Former Ammo Complainer here.
---
At the lower levels, people tend to put perk cards on their current problem. If you are always over encumbered you pick up Pack Rat; if you are always low on health, you pick up First Aid. This problem-solving approach is a good one for low-level players, but it leads to steady-state equilibrium in various aspects of your build. The amount of ammo you expend is roughly equivalent to the amount of ammo you pick up. Same with caps. Same with stimpaks. Same with food. If it used to take 2 bullets to drop a ghoul, but now takes 3 with the patch, then that's a 50% increase in your ammo usage, which is going to bust your ammo equilibrium. This generally leads to a cap crisis as you fast travel around buying ammo.
---
Since it doesn't take much to push the system out of equilibrium, it also doesn't take much to bring it back. As a level 32, the #1 thing you should do is when you hit level 34, is take the Ammosmith card (it's a level 34 Agility perk, if the card is available to you). This will produce 40% more ammo when you craft, and up to 80% if you double down on that card. That alone will shift things back to normal. In the meantime, put down as many Scrounger (Level 3 Luck perk) cards as you can (40 to 80% more ammo found in ammo containers).
---
As far as plastic goes, go to almost any low-level location in The Forest and LOOT EVERYTHING. This [LINK](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plastic_(Fallout_76)) shows about a hundred items that scrap to plastic. I complain about a lot of stuff,, but I've never had problem with plastic.
---
And is bugged AF. Got it last month on the last days of past meat week and had to stop using it after placing it for first time.
---
I can't place it anywere, it either merges on the ceiling and stops moving or starts clipping on everything and moving erratically while doing metalic loud noises.
---
You may definately be able to get one of someone is willing to trade either the be or tse handmade for the outfit. I'm not having a go at you either, people are jsut very picky on this game when it comes to trades for meta weapons.
---
I had about 250 worth and I started out buying scrapping. Made it to about 150, and now I just buy/scrap one or two when I FT to a camp vendor as it loads in. Just chipping away at it.
---
Can I get a scorchbeast?
---
Blocking legendary OK, thanks for the info, saves me looking it up. I've not got that at the moment but I do have a shopping spree at Mrs Grumble coming up, something to look out for üëç
---
Another thing to of you can't find a be or a tse handmade an aae handmade is the next best thing, even a ffr handmade
---
yeah i can tell, it seems like currency on this game is just pure mega weapons considering the max caps you can have is pretty low
---
I somehow got the opportunity to do Colossal solo on Saturday.  It took a while, but I did it.  Full health build with a Q/33/RW Fixer.  Sneaking circles around Earle, shots on the Screaming head, breaking away to get the wendigos after they dropped.  Didn't get near as many screws as I usually do, but it was satisfying.  Cost me about 2k rounds of Ultracite 45 and two weapon repair kits, though.
---
Grab it from a body of water, like a river.
---
You should be able to get it as quickly as you hit the button.
---
I have a TS/10/90 Fat Man i keep around to just get rid of all the mini nukes i've been getting, it's not great but since it weights only 2pound i can afford to keep it
---
That's why furious explosive weapons don't work so well
---
Awesome. Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Next thing you're gonna tell me is that Meg calls me 76er because I'm from Vault 76 or something crazy like that.
---
My gauss shotguns at close range just shoot right through enemies doing no damage, if I keep firing I think the explosive area of effect takes them out eventually. I have dense torso so I don't die now.
---
You mean like the event notification pop up that appears top left of your screen?
---
You need to buy it
---
Same
---
I have.. mixed feelings on the ops, and yeah, its partly because my potato no-brain build got janked up by the last update.
---
*not what I'm annoyed by though*  
---
*any* major rework that influences damage of both enemies and of in game gear should have come with some form of skill reset, even if it would have just been in special stats. Can I still play the game? Of course, its just must more ammo intensive that it feels it needs to be. Lord knows I can't do the ops outside of teams, and most ops teams I join don't do them : /
---
Its a great addition, but it just feels awkward for the moment.
---
the new legendary card for exploding corpses on range kills (Far Flung Fireworks was the name i think) does the job as good if not even better
---
I was so freaking irritated yesterday, I decided to kill Earle since I hadn't done it in a while. Burned through \~5 plasma cores, and the goddamn game froze. Lost a workshop in the deal, too.
---
Smart, Stab someone with that and there dead from infection.
---
HE FOUND OUT
---
I‚Äôll use them on stuff like the queen but it‚Äôs mostly to get rid of the weight as opposed to actually wanting to use it. You don‚Äôt really find big enough groups that you want to use it and it doesn‚Äôt actually do enough damage to be worth it on single targets.
---
Yeah, I've scrapped mine.
---
Fallout 76 is full of them. Radiant quests up the wazoo
---
Yeah, any paired animation would be awesome like in TF2, for example high five or rock paper scizzors
---
do enemies drop mini nukes in such a scenario? cause its the only reason i would consider using it
---
Deep Pockets works on all limbs
---
Yep, they rerolled the Ops today.
---
Previously, they saw players disliked Resilient Robots and RNG blessed Beth with another Resilient Robots the next day. Makes no sense this time though, unless one of the brass wanted to check out the game and has a VATS char, which would have been kind of frustrating, so phoned in to make them reroll.
---
pff Mininukes, I only do Maxinukes (silo nuke launch)
---
My game was really glitching out as it usually does during the SBQ event, and i was trying to repair it and hit a different button by accident. It was stupid, believe me. I chastised myself plenty afterward lmao
---
I can never pick them up.
---
My AA FFR handmade is pretty great, let me tell you!
---
Elder needs to be 100% chance for rare drop , I've got no rewards on my main for the past 2 days with elder runs, it's fucking bullshit üò†
---
Depending on your play style, it's not impossible to switch between a Power Armor build and a Stealth build. Attached is my current setup. Agility is boosted through legendary perks by 5 points, but previously I would only run Adrenaline when in power armor and sacrifice White Knight and one point in Action Boy.  It's not a complete min/max build, but you get 90% of the way there and get to switch things up when the situation calls for a different approach.
---
[My current Fallout 76 build](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mt7kPwo)
---
Luckily I don‚Äôt get mowed down but if you do get mowed down that would defiantly suck.
---
If it had a similar UI to trade windows in previous Fallouts? Select units you want to sell, calculates the caps, sends it over and you can select multiple items to sell before you confirm
---
Suppose, but I can't imaging why someone would have five of the same weapon on them, oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Exactly, AA is great but an AA ffr would be dangerous, wouldn't even need a tse or be.
---
LOL...I need this one.  I have some Vampire gun that someone told me is fantastic but I haven't really used it.  I'll have to check that one out again.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt even go double check.  I was using it to fire upon the enemies that were too far out of range for my shotgun, but I never went to the corpses to loot the bodies, but considering I tried to clean up as many corpses after killing the boss and that I didn‚Äôt see a single mini-nuke after makes me think that no, they don‚Äôt drop the mini-nukes.
---
Very possible I was low health with adrenal and/or nerd rage kicked in.  It shouldn't matter with additive buffing.  My 60% commando cards should add the same 60% of base (roughly 25-30) damage no matter when i apply them.  Otherwise we have perks canceling each other out.   Or maybe im glitched somehow.
---
What do you want for it? I'm on xbone and I haven't gotten it yet, if be interested
---
Go to r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 without all the periods for your trading needs. They have a karma system showing how many successful trades each person has done. They also have couriers vetted by mods to act as middle men when neither part is comfortable going first.
---
I have been trading there for almost 2 years with 0 issues
---
Solo, 7:34 Vault 94, Volatile Blood Eagles
---
Team of 4, 6:58, Burning Mine, Cloaking Blood Eagles
---
I wish I could throw it haha
---
alright sounds good, i‚Äôll check it out, thank you ! :)
---
Nice...He shot first and I had this 3 star legendary grenade gun and fired once back and then he destroyed me with the gatling plasma gun in a second.

There are actual people who will take their log and cut it up before putting it in the toilet, im assuming it's  a commentary on that
---
What is duping?
---
Is there a dog or cat you can tame?   Seems less likely to be murdered by a fellow player.
---
It takes a half of a second to apply after your first sneak attack. If you're 2 shotting everything like most decent commandos do, your second shot that kills them hits to quickly to benefit from Follow Through.
---
This perk shines on beefy enemies and bosses.
---
Yea, I have one but I think it is just 1 Star legendary.  I didn't have it on me at the time.
---
Looking to buy some droids?
---
So is that different than legendary?
---
Yesterday I got the second best legendary drop I've ever gotten from a Daily op. 3 star AA/25/15 50 cal machine gun. Fucking daily OPs are a great add to this game.
---
I know I'm going to get down votes for this but doing this would sh#t on the crazy high players who stuck to one character. Getting gold is way easier than ranking up high enough to max the legendaries out.
---
Ahhh......So what is a legacy weapon?  Just an old one that was never removed or something?
---
For as HUGE!! as it is the inside is TINNNY af its like a crappy genie lamp big outside itty bitty inside
---
Thanks...much appreciated.
---
Just make sure you're formatting your post title correctly, otherwise it won't post. Just see how others have formatted and copy them. It's rather strict but simple once you figure it out
---
I actually didn‚Äôt mind the appearance of the Vault 94 scout armour and used to run around just wearing that with no outfit for a while as it was relatively unique. The one thing I didn‚Äôt like was the graphics glitch on the vines on the mask
---
Soloed freezing super mutants and exploding eagles in just under 8 so its possible just hard
---
It's a legendary that no longer drops. Mainly explosive energy weapons.
---
if you're on PC you can install the mod "Event Notifications", it shows a notification every time an event starts.
---
This is how it looks: https://i.imgur.com/XL3Hlur.png
---
DM me. I'll be on later in the day and will even see about getting another two to join us.
---
Vamps is the best in daily ops. Health never goes belown 90 percent  I just sell the 30 stimpaks after
---
I'll give that a try.  I just can't seem to find the mods that make it that much better.  Nor do I ever have like 25k caps to buy one.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine why people would trade legacies and ultra rare outfits for a BoS outfit they can get themselves, oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
But any good (or bad, depending on your perspective) Duper will have about 50 of each weapon and outfit they chose to dupe. Inevitably, it‚Äôll spill out to having multiple copies in your main.
---
Lemme get a earl plushie irl pls
---
Yeah, the top damage builds aren't orders of magnitude higher than the normal stuff now. I don't feel like I'm missing out on stupid amounts of damage if I use a Vampire weapon anymore. I like it.
---
September 21 2020, still not fixed.
---
Someone could probably help you on the trading sub
---
if you add 7 and 9 together you get 16, uranium is 92, add 16 and .92 you get 16.92, if you multiply 16.92 and 76 you get 1337 which is a melting point of gold
---
Sounds like the same problem. Weapon ranges makes it even worse so shotguns have a huge problem. Sadly the gauss pistol suffers from the same as with a silencer it's range is worse than a shotgun. Bizarre decision by the devs there.
---
Oh, I‚Äôm well aware, but at the very least, they weren‚Äôt directly antagonizing the citizens this time around. Eckhart was definitely an insane fool, though.
---
Ok thanks
---
This thread gave me a headache...
---
You deserve a cape!
---
No lief, we have enough as it is
---
I notice the 'tack-on' which occurs after the second shot, but I don't think it's a remotely strong amount (generally a slither of a health bar).
---
Still, waiting to be impressed by it.
---
*Or you‚Äôve collected plenty from the many, many other events and quests that give plenty of them.
---
blegh.  i get that people are opposed to grinding.  me personally, i'm extremely opposed to it.  to the point i haven't bothered to get the raiders above cooperative and the settlers above friendly yet.
---
but... in this case, i really feel a "be happy with what you got" is well warranted.  there's a lot i don't agree with in terms of bethesda handling the game and bugs and etc.  but the legendary perk system solved a problem they didn't have to solve.  i'm level 150 something, and i play more than some, but many play more than me, and i was able to bring all four of my slots to rank two and am 2 points aways from bringing one of them to rank three.
---
yeah the grind is gonna suck for the next rank, but that's still a heap of benefits i've reaped for free.  you didn't need the legendary perks before, you don't need them after, enjoy what you get, don't fret over stuff you'll get eventually.
---
this isn't a "please sir, may i have some more" oliver twist addition, this is going to a buffet and asking for a takeout container after you've eaten.
---
Thanks, but I didn‚Äôt make that guide, I just share it to help others. u/descendent1784 organized if all from multiple authors and sources.
---
Laser rifles and Gatling Plasmas with the explosive legendary effect.
---
Food build
---
They are still working on it apparently, I honestly feel the devs are unable to fix this and many other long standing bugs for whatever reason, engine, lack of experienced developers? Who knows.
---
This is the end of the world, exploring the post apocalypse should always feel like an end game activity
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of a perk that causes legendaries to glow.  The devs should make that happen without a perk otherwise this becomes a must have perk and that further fucks up builds.
---
It happened to me multiple times that counter starts regardless of what I'm doing at the beginning
---
Don't forget Silt Bean Puree:
---
* Tato x2
---
* Wood x1
---
* Spices x1
---
* Silt Bean x2
---
* Boiled Water x2
---
It's a bit more effort but you'll get 30% (38% with Strange In Numbers perk!) damage reduction for an hour. Super strong for defense.
---
I usually wait a few minutes. If it‚Äôs been 5 minutes though, I‚Äôm starting that thing.
---
Personally, I doubt it‚Äôs aliens who are getting the spotlight. Instead, I think the answers lies in the nukes - too much will create enough pyroclastic storms, and if they lost long enough, those can kill/starve everyone in Appalachia with little hope of survival.
---
It also opens up room for the Enclave to come through later and grab the hellfire prototype from 51 and the institute to grab the Appalachian strain of FEV for their super mutants, as both factions have superb radiation resistance.
---
Five months later and this whole issue remains unfixed, I presume it is unfixable without breaking other code so it's being ignored.
---
And yes this bug/s effect the Gauss Shotguns very much.
---
You can still complete the run with the group and get whatever time comes. Then you can run it again for a better time and rank while getting the rewards for that rank.
---
Once every so often I'll see a low level player show up to scorched earth launching them at the queen because they haven't yet figured out that it's completely useless on her.  That's about the only time I have seen people use them.
---
That would destroy server stability.  If they ever getg to the point where they can increase stash size they should just do it.
---
‚Äúnot wanting to risk losing my once per day reward‚Äù
---
You do realize that you have unlimited attempts to get the 3 tiers, right?
---
Wait, some people are still talking to Ward *after* they reached max reputation?
---
That would kill server stability though.
---
My vampiric gatling would like to have a word with that scrapheap too.
---
Actually.. That thing is a laugh. First time i did that mission solo the Intimidator and me just stood in place and unloaded on each other with aformentioned gatling sucking up life-energy so fast it almost looked like i was cheating because my health barely went under 90%
---
de los hijos
---
That's fair, but I've had to quit my world multiple times because of level 50s or 80s running in seconds after I get in myself.
---
I know fallout 76 isn't that good sometimes, but the fire stove? I don't know man
---
I'd argue that right now it's neither, before the update that intoduced daily ops and legendary perks it was probably .50 and 5.56 (.50 was especially good since you could craft a lot more of it than 5.56) however daily ops drop ridiculous amounts of ammo, and legendary perks make crafting ammo way easier, making selling ammo meaningless, i still have 18000 .50 round in my stash waiting for someone to buy it at 1 cap each
---
I know it‚Äôs probably meant to look like it‚Äôs mid-pounce but I can‚Äôt unsee it looking like it‚Äôs tip-toeing up behind you
---
I think you're understanding just fine. It seems that OPwas pushed into an open fire stove. That doesn't seem like a "laugh out loud" moment, more like abuse. I'm hoping there's something that was left out.
---
Let's get through Halloween and Christmas first ay lol
---
eeh. Not realy. I am runing what i call a tanky-vampire-packratt-build  wich focuses on carryweight and resillience and so far i dont feel much  difference.
---
Only during one occasion, Fasnaught Day Event at the end, so kill all the small mobs that were going after the robots. Since they were low level back then they all died fast.
---
Or get the option to scrip rewards for 50 atoms
---
You might want to check a new server - you may be on one that is on it‚Äôs last leg, so to speak. The ones I‚Äôve been on have had very active events what with the new SCORE season on. Events are the best way to get that XP.
---
Load lag is interfering with the servers though.
---
Robot missions are definitely harder than the others!  Fun though!
---
Additionaly to what other commented, you can toggle the menu to only show what you have already unlocked. Helps finding stuff.
---
For common resources, sure, but if we start making nuclear keycards, then we could just as easily start printing Caps out of steel and paint, gold bullion out of gold scrap, etc etc. At what point do we stop short of just making the nuclear missiles ourselves?
---
Yeah, it's not going to change your life. It's additive like everything else now so you're looking at 40% of your base weapon damage being tacked on. 
---
It's not much in terms of a few shots but if you add up the total damage gained over a 10 minute fight, it's appreciable. Not jaw dropping, and not as powerful as Covert Operative (which IS multiplicative) but still, it's something. 
---
I agree with you, though. Not exactly legendary.
---
And why exactly did you *have* to quit?
---
The world is not orderly nor does it tick by your clock.  People play how people play.  Adapt or move on.
---
That's no going to change the render distance. Maybe your friend just needs glasses.
---
Can easily solo elder so why wait?
---
True.
---
Why quit? Play with 2 and if you don‚Äôt get the best reward just play again.
---
You can only do the daily op one time to get a rare reward, and if you get a tier lower than elder you lose the higher chance for the day, atleast that's how I thought it worked. You can do the daily op as much as you want, but once you beat it on a certain tier, that's your reward for the day.
---
Seems like not a lot of people know about the classic poop knife story.
---
Constant radiation would be funny as shit for the bloodied builds.
---
Why there's not I'll never know
---
Ah another that does not understand. Okay so check it out a long time ago there was a stash glitch. It was found to have no effect on the servers until you had over 1000 unique items in it.   
---
I was once one of those bastards over a million weight in my stash, 2200% camp budgets ,helping dupe. One thing is for sure Bethesda set an arbitrary number to keep people from hoarding and out farming more.   
---
It did not cause server lag nor cause the disconnects, that was the dupe process dropping people like flies.
---
Can we please stop calling it SS-Armor for the sake of us german players ? Thanks :p
---
Turn pacifist mode on!
---
the only issue is staying under76% food to not mess up hp balance of bloodied build with well fed bonus
---
I will check up and fix when is confirmed, thanks for the heads up
---
Nope, I‚Äôve personally done it where I got Elder and it‚Äôs rewards on the 4th completion (first day with the melee)
---
How is generating the keycard that starts two types of end-game fights (SBQ/Earl) different from generating a keycard/recall card that starts one type of end-game fight (Encryptid)? We already can do what I'm requesting, I just want to expand the ability.
---
I agree. I would love to know how many times I died from radiation trying SQB when I was low level or colonel Gutsys.
---
Why would you want to do that to yourself?
---
I once had a particularly prescient stealthed assaultron insta-kill head laser me 5 times in row in a silo. I don't ever need to relive that.
---
For me is like 7000, it depends on how much xp they give you. You can use the spreadsheet to calculate it.
---
Yesterday my first run was screwed cause of this. Had a 8:46 clear time. 2nd run did it at 5:30 but i ended up getting a rare reward on my 2nd run
---
Ahhh....got that.  Yea, I haven't seen one in forever.
---
Incorrect, you can unlock each tier once a day. Doesn't matter if you have to run it 8 times before getting Elder tier. Once you eventually get the 8 minute run, you'll still get the Elder Tier reward.
---
Gotcha....thanks.
---
How many times you've been killed by well fed wearing off. How many times you've accidentally irradiated yourself to death collecting water. How many times you've offed yourself with an explosive weapon....
---
It would be kinda amusing. üëç
---
Take Electrical Abosrption and laugh at Assaultrons. Though it requires power armor.
---
Well...  I guess itll come someday lol
---
did daily ops 3 days in a row, got symptomatic 3 days in a row
---
This is my problem with the game. Though there is something to be said for seeing a room full of level 70-100 super mutants!
---
And scrip! They fixed the primal cuts events too!
---
Coincidence? Yes, absolutely
---
This is incorrect. You get the Elder reward once per day, but you get unlimited tries to get to it. I've done it. Had one where it took me 3 tried to get Elder. Got rewards for the first two ranks, then got the reward for Elder when I got finally made it under 8 minutes.
---
As if i'd want paying for it. 
---
I can also put down a solar panel generator as well if you want one. And if you need 3 stimpack diffusers for the tadpole medic badge i can give you 3 of those as well. 
---
GT: rammadeus. i'm on an alt though so if you want one i'd have to swap. You on now?
---
No, Covert Operative is still multiplicative. It's just working off of a much smaller number now.
---
See i have fo76 in the my games folder but there isnt a folder called pictures inside it.
---
Oh no..I dont need that kind of reminder.
---
You should add what system your on, and level.
---
Im running full health heavy weapons. Switching between junkies and vampire. Ive never used vampire consistently but its quickly becoming my favorite lol
---
Because some outfits already have backpacks and the clipping would be absurd.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I thought by running in and activating the timer and completing it it was screwing up the rewards for that day.
---
I'm constantly managing weight as it is, I'd just be unable to play if all my character where full of dozens of duped items.
---
Sadly, due the game design, its all about the most efficient weapons. Aka, highest dps weapons with good ammo economy. Fat Man are neither, unfortunately.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I have killed my sled with it. Since the patch.
---
That is just right for a handmade with a base damage of 45. I am guessing that it‚Äôs a legendary of some kind or that your not at full health or that you have other dmg perk cards on because 55 percent seems a little high for the base damage.
---
Yup.  Its a slap to the FACE for the majority of the playerbase.   Let‚Äôs redo calculations that nerf damage across the board for everyone but lets leave legacies alone.  
---
They were already OP and became even more OP on this patch.
---
Edit: all the ebay legacy buyers on the downvote mission.
---
Yeah. I had never been to Vault 94 so I was turned around lol. I bet once people start doing these for awhile we will see some pretty crazy speedruns
---
Prime example was yesterday I joined a Daily Ops group, joined the OP and 5 seconds after getting out of the loading screen I was welcomed by the After Report.
---
They done it in roughly 7 minutes, so I got the Elder Tier reward by simply loading in.
---
I think the OP means not to finish any OBJ and just farm kills and pick up ammo as they go.
---
I run plague walker and the symptomatic removes my diseases just fine. If anything I've noticed that I rarely catch diseases now and they go away much quicker without the machine.
---
Ugh, that looks amazing.  I need that.
---
And yet I cannot find a single plan for sale in any vendor
---
I tried a two shot fatman after I found out auto grenade launchers got a buff of sorts and became viable. But the fatman is just not worth it. The ammo weight, the 50/50 chance of the nuke just falling through the world, and incredibly high damage fall off on its explosion. You can break it out for a giggle but it's not a viable main weapon.
---
It's more of a dupe issues. The actual normal of legacy's weapons legit are like maybe 1000. But due to duping glitches (thank god they been gone for awhile) people who legit had legacy's duped the shit out of them so that's why u see more of them.
---
Issue is if they flat out remove them in shits on the people who legit had them.
---
Imo they should just be removed I'm sorry if you got it legit I kno it sucks but they should all just be delete from ppl inventory.
---
Yes maybe u grinded for them but other mmos and games have done this with problem weapons before. 
---
Destiny has just disabled weapons that are busted until they fix it or just flat out remove it (pocket infinity).
---
NV actually let you do this somewhat with GRA installed. You could string together a bunch of microfusion cells and make a big bomb out of it. Did a whopping base 450 damage and went up to 800s with perks.
---
I thought they weren't doing Halloween?
---
I get that, but let's be honest here, this isn't Metro or Stalker. Fallout is just an RPG setted in a post-apocalyptic world, and his gameplay is more about having "fun" than "surviving". Never intended to be "faithful representation" of a post-apocalyptic world.
---
How can you take seriously Fallout's post-apocalyptic world when there's people around running with power armors, mini nuke launchers and weapons that shot laser beams?
---
It would be kinda weird to find somebody who doesn't play it on here
---
Carry around 2 SS chestpieces my man! I had one with fall damage reduction I put a jetpack on that I just swapped in when I wanted to jetpack a bunch.
---
I want his weapon. It's insane. Although I'm sure if we had it it would be awful.
---
Yao Guai: I was hiding under your workshop because I love you, can I st...(gunfire)
---
Don‚Äôt start things with‚Äùhere‚Äôs another that doesn‚Äôt understand‚Äù unless you actually have a clue what you are talking about  You suggested that lag isn‚Äôt interfering with server stability so don‚Äôt condescend to me about what you know because your understanding is flawed at best.
---
When the servers have to track multiple items with unique conditions that causes strain for the servers.  10 steel and 1000 steel are just ‚Äústeel = x‚Äù but two different 10mm pistols are each their own item and have to be tracked separately.  When the servers start tracking hundreds to thousands of extra items it causes instability.  Instability can lead to lags or even crashes.  HAVING MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALLY TRACKED ITEMS IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE DO WITH MORE STASH SPACE.
---
Your second paragraph just amounts to ‚Äú I was the problem but don‚Äôt get that I was the problem‚Äù. It might have been stable for you but your actions can impact others whose connections aren‚Äôt as great.  
---
The dupe that was going on during the infinite JUNK stash caused crashes IN ADDITION to other things like the CAMP budget glitch.  There isn‚Äôt/wasn‚Äôt just one cause of instability.
---
Whoa sweet glitch. Did you kill both and get loot from both of them?
---
I think Jake does.
---
woops, fixing!
---
That‚Äôs me. Kill one player nope, kill one creature nope, pick one lock nope, place your camp yes that I can do.
---
I was happy to get it, but to be honest it looks too modern-esque and way too practical for my take on retro future style of Fallout universe.
---
That would be inneffective. You now need a nuclear strike to kill anything.
---
As far as i remember explosive effect does not reset or give stacks on furious. Only the real impact / bullet. Meaning if you are shooting at a boss and some critter walks by and gets blasted by explosive splash damage, it doesn't reset boss stacks.
---
i use commando perks and vanguard/sentinel armor, i dont die a lot and manage to kill most things pretty easily
---
Ultra cute got me!
---
This is why you have an alt GT for any illicit activities and maybe even one just for storage.
---
I tamed a level 100 Deathclaw at level 150ish several days ago but sadly it was diseased and started attacking everything in my CAMP. Had to put the poor boy down.
---
No, you can't trade ones that drop as legendary for you.
---
Maybe try to run the game with admin permissions, if that solves the problem there might be a permission issue with the folder (unlikely). Another possibility - some 3rd party antivirus scanner/malware protection
---
It‚Äôs safe to say that just about everyone you see with a legacy is using one that was duped while the original is still with the person who found it.  Carrying a legacy is a mark of shame saying, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt play this game normally so I cheat and make myself look like a fool.‚Äù  They shouldn‚Äôt be reworked, they should just be deleted.
---
Issue is explosive weapons are ass. They need a major buff. Fat man and missiles should do the most dmg in the game period. The ammo weighs a shit ton.
---
They used to scale with heavy weapons but they took that out because it was to strong (it really wasn't like at all) but that was at launch before people found junkies bloodied etc.. which is way stronger then they ever were.
---
Imo missile launcher and fat man need there dmg at bare minimum tripled. Even then idk if it be using due to how the ammo works.
---
Whistle in the dark also doesn‚Äôt show up on the displays
---
He dude I'm on ps4 level 153, I'm willing to help you out if you want
---
Just got a 3 star bloodied Fatman I think I‚Äôll keep it and rock it when I have nukes. I have had 1 stars drop and just scrip them. I also have a two shot one I have kept. But no, no one really uses them. But I think I will see what the bloodied one can do. Says it‚Äôs at 2300 damage so let‚Äôs see what it does to Earle.... prob nothing but here‚Äôs to hoping
---
They don‚Äôt need to be deleted.  BES just needs to make the changes they promised almost 2 years ago. 
---
Either nerf the explosive damage like they did to all other weapons or replace the explosive effect with something else.  
---
People trading for these shouldn‚Äôt be mad.  BES said they were gonna make changes.  That‚Äôs the risk yous took.
---
I have a TS5090 Farman and it‚Äôs great at clearing packs of enemies.
---
Did they nerf the damage of bloodied? I‚Äôm sorry, I haven't played the game in 2+ months, now coming back, I feel like something‚Äôs a bit off and quite isn't right. I noticed most of my weapons (which 2 months ago was able to 1 shot most common enemy) now need 2-3 shot just to kill a level 60 super mutant (I‚Äôm level 300+)
---
I agree.  Current system is kind of tedious. 
---
When it came out I had 350 card packs saved up.  It took me around 20 minutes to open all of them.  Another hour and a half scrapping bad cards, one at a time.  I had like 30 copies of goat legs. 
---
It's nice now though, I have 8 cards maxed out and like 500 coins left over.
---
Remap VATS
---
I‚Äôve been using a vampires gatling plasma and with all the cores I get for finishing the ops I almost never run out of ammo. 
---
Only problem is the spin up. 
---
Any way I can improve the speed of that?
---
&gt;not genocidal manics
---
Yes, if you skip all the dialoge/holotope/terminal entries in the game about the Enclave.
---
You can. It's dumb, but you can.
---
I \*HATE\* this. Now my heavy gunner will have one in the wall and my melee won't have one to use.
---
Ya I agree, if there was a way to tell who legit got one with 100% accuracy I'd say they can keep it cus you would hardly see them but theres no way they can do that. So I say remove them all
---
Because all those things exist in real life in differing capabilities. Smallest atomic bomb system was man portable IIRC, powered exoskeletons exist, and laser weapon technology is being worked on. You can see vids on YouTube of people with proof of concepts popping balloons and such. Give mankind another couple hundred years and let's see what we got
---
The Fixer.
---
 Microsoft is paying $7.5 billion for Zenimax/Bethesda
---
You can stay as long as u want as long as u dont do the obj
---
The Ohio Adventure Run?  I am not familiar with that.
---
Right?!
---
Uiii, thats a fuckton of ammo awaiting me, thanks for the headsup
---
Yo, wtf? Is OP ok?
---
Is there a less, emm, invasive way to go idle without triggering the inactive timer?
---
Good, I've never had a bad experience with MS' customer support.
---
No one wants to consider the music license when this is suggested. I'm positive Bethesda and who ever they get their music from have a contract for the rights to the music they use. If they wanted to sell you a jukebox with new music on it for real money, the original license holder will want a new contract and a cut. It's not as easy as " it's already in the game why not".
---
it's happened, they just announced it https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/?ocid=Parterships_soc_omc_xbo_fb_Video_buy_9.21.1
---
Seems kinda OP if you‚Äôre spamming stimpacks/team medic
---
That only works for public events.  You aren‚Äôt alerted when AWOL Armaments pops up.
---
If Q is fire, what did you set vats to?
---
Yeah I've learned to dodge them mostly, I was bloodied for so long it's habit, on the rare occasion I hit them I'll just make a new serum. Bloody Mess 3 is worth a flux every couple weeks haha
---
Aw man, they said you can get the shits from eating bad food, but that must've been some pretty crazy bat shits lol
---
Yeah, I saw, couldnt update fast enough.. can't change the title now, lol!
---
Oh, you know my old username
---
I get that. And realistically, that would make life easier. But once you make a resource easier to get, you somewhat devalue it.
---
That, and it would not surprise me if Bethesda took this one step by letting you buy a reusable Nuclear Keycard (think Bender from Futurama putting a string on it and yoinking it back out) ***with Atoms***.
---
Those damn tunnel snakes.
---
That would be too op though. Low health builds need an advantage over high health builds because they cans die more easily. With bloodied you are trading health for damage.
---
That's it.
---
Base damage with a standard receiver is 48 and 60 with a hardened receiver for a +12/+25% damage bonus.
---
That lines up with (48\*1.75)+12 to equal 96 exactly.  Which means that Bloody Mess is an additive bonus as well (some people were speculating that it was still multiplicative, which this clearly indicates it is not).
---
Much appreciated :)
---
Arroz Con Pollo
---
My man...
---
Edit. K lo k
---
Hi bud, I dunno what stuff you lost so can't tell you best places to get it, but I can just straight up give you some materials if you need help
---
People like you make the community a great place, when I'm on my main account I usually drop 20 stimpacks, Radaways, and low level weapons maxed out with the best I can put on it
---
I was bloodied for so long I never go through them, it's trained into my brain at this point haha
---
So cancel my PS5 preorder?
---
Junkies. Junkies is imo better then bloodied for me. Bloodied requires way more perk investment while  junkies requires legit none. 
---
You do a little less dmg then bloodied big whoop.
---
Junkies is also better if your a PA player as bloodied imo only shines due to unyeilding.
---
Plus with one wasteland bloodied took a hit and players take more dmg hence why u see bloodied players complaining how much more they die.
---
With my power armor heavy gun junkie I legit never die and deal almost the same dmg with my junkie gauss minigun as my bloodied did.
---
I still delete stuff in like 2 seconds with my junkie weapons, bloodied is overkill imo for the perk investment. Rather have way more build variety and take 1 extra shot to kill a enemy.
---
I'll never do bloodied again personally, I enjoy tank style play and I also have stupid crazy dmg.
---
No, you are awesome!
---
I am absolutely not a synth.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Never gonna happen lol.
---
I agree to a degree. I‚Äôd counter that unyielding requires you to sacrifice large amounts of health for it to work. Perhaps capping the full health version at +2 or even +1.
---
yes heavy gunners make their own now.  Like I do.  But .45 and 5.56 still sell out for me in one session.
---
I farmed flamer fuel and ultracite ammo for about half an hour the other day before I went for the objectives.
---
After you kill the Boss, you will be put on a 4 minute timer before the OP ends.

I'm level 147 - the grind was tough enough - I don't play everyday- One wasteland kinda ruined it for me.
---
Nevermind, I need to learn how to read.
---
lol, breaking news indeed!
---
Same. After the gause minigun, secret service armor, and jet pack...there isn't anything worth the gold.
---
i'm level 12 on my new character and honestly the game feels easier than I remember it being. I'm already one shotting scorched and two shotting most other enemies. I think it's supposed to be 35-50 where it gets exponentially harder
---
2 star is a 30% return, 3 star is a 40% return.  Though I tend to take 3 stars just to keep storage weight down, and not because it's 'worth' more
---
You can post on the PTS forum yourself .)
---
Sound logic, I only asked because I dont have the plan yet and was wondering if I could learn the plan and drop a weapon for the GF or if I should give her the plan (she isnt the grindy type), since its apparebtlt like SS I will just give the plan to her and hope the rng treats her nice
---
You need to add a dense chest mod. Negates all damage (armor takes a hit) from explosions while using Fireproof 3. Being a bloodied build with a few explosive weapons I had to figure this out real quick.
---
Edit: This does apply to legacy weapons.
---
can you do a screenshot of it in your pip boy not equipped and also hit view and another screenshot there, then equip it and a picture of it equipped in the pip boy with your health low and also a picture of it in view while equipped too, those 4 printscreens are like a 2 second job if your not making this up and could confirm it is real to everyone who owns a glaive and is skeptical of how weird the picture looks.

Had my camp in cranberry bog the last six months. I never get tired of this.

---
This would make alot of people running low health builds switch to full.From what I gather unyielding is a risk - reward  type of thing you get the +3 at 20 percent or lower I believe and 2+at somewhere around 30%hp.maybe add something for full health but it shouldn't be a plus 3 to each
---
Saw that on Polygon.
---
Was a bit shocked.
---
That's a pretty big deal.

---
You are the hero we need. Thank you - I'm so tired of hearing her voice every time I get close to Charleston.
---
Doubtful. Anything new will hit xbox and pc first then ps5. Least I imagine so since a few games from Bethesda or zenimax are hitting ps5 first for a year.
---
Then again maybe. Do what feels right for you.
---
Either ice or fire because now those elements have their own damage type instead of energy so there's not too much enemies resistent to them. In terms of utility I prefer ice glaive because the slow debuff and because fire glaive doesn't heal npc with friendly fire perk.
---
I'm also an unlucky like you, I got the glaive plan with my comando character and I can't trade it to my melee character xD
---
holyyyyy fuckkkk
---
With the current base damage yes, but they could have lowered it.
---
Surprise wendigo butt sex
---
I'll try running with admin, but I only run windows defender on my PC.
---
Theoretically with this model you could be trading APM for damage.  That is, instead of shooting you would be spending some amount of time/attention on healing.
---
Of course, healing is its own reward because, as they say in World of Warcraft, "your dps drops to zero when you are dead."
---
While I think the idea of a bonus for people staying at high/max health is a good one, I think it has to be less than the Unyielding bonus as Unyielding is obviously more risky and because staying at high health is desirable in its own right.
---
I was just sad when I tried to give it to my melee. But thanks. Hope our close quarters characters get one soon.
---
Here's to Series X optimization!!!
---
They added what rads recently, so many of us have passive radaways now essentially. I'm not bloodied but they're essentially pointless for me. I don't really even need many Stims, I have plenty and between healing factor and my high DR power armor u don't really have to use many stims.
---
Fallout become an exclusive?
---
I have been booted from fresh teams a few times.  I assume they were waiting for friends.  Booting in-mission could be a problem.
---
Doesn't pacifist mode just disable your damage to other players?
---
Nice :)
---
Perhaps this is OP, but this also has its own "difficulties" - you will have to try to keep your health always at maximum, otherwise the bonus will subside, and at low health it is already at the level of +3 and damage is mostly ignored by strong perks. Plus, there will be less damage, although in the last patch the difference is not so big, but still noticeable
---
Will you please post a pic of it?
---
I  named my legendary wedding ring the "Thotbegone". When observed closely it disconnects you from the server.
---
Grim Reaper Sprint for fun and profit!
---
Do I dare hope....a fallout game....made by Obsidian once more?!?!?! NO! hope has only led to heartache for me....but maybe?

New players join and subsequently leave games all the time. The journey is important but end game content is what players work towards and what keeps them in the game once they reach a certain point. If there is no end game worth playing then nobody stays and thus you don't have a playerbase anymore. Has absolutely zero to do with economics.
---
The game is on Games Pass because when it came out iy was a shit show and was reviewed poorly by every major games journal AND high profile streamers. It also was accompanied by a legitimate scandal with the Power Armor edition items. The game is still fighting to clean up it's reputation and that was almost two years ago.
---
I disagreed with your statement, one of the great things about roleplaying RPG FPS game like Fallout is- well, the roleplaying part (whether I use a bow and roleplay as a hunter or a 50 Cal hunting rifle and roleplay as a special op is up to me- I should be able to hold my own ground using both build and weapon). Yes, I understand that some weapons are supposed to be better than others (a .50 Cal to the face is gonna hurt more than an arrow) but that doesn't mean you should brick‚Äôd and made lesser/lower tier weapons completely useless like right now. By doing this, you narrowed the entire community into one specific build and set of armors/weapons, everybody running the same thing because other items/builds are no longer worth using. 
---
Where‚Äôs the diversity? What‚Äôs the point?
---
If the main "downside" to playing at full health is that you don't have the stats from Unyielding, that doesn't mean there should be a full health equivalent. It means Unyielding is too powerful and should be re-balanced. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think Fallout 4/76 was ever *meant* to be played at low-health 24/7. It was meant to give you a temporary boost when shit was hitting the fan.
---
If it's a digital only version might be worthwhile still next year once there's actually games out for it worth playing. Launch titles are reeeeeeally slim.
---
If they follow the route they have with other MS owned games, it also means that on XB it will be free or incredibly cheap at launch if you have game pass (also now that you get game pass ultimate, also means this works for PC players as well rather than using the hopefully soon to be dead and replaced Bethesda loader)
---
So that could save hundreds of dollars over the life of the console.
---
So your saying nerf every explosive prefix cus of legacy's? That makes legit zero sense. The problem is explosive ON energy weapons let's not fuck over people good weapons cus people cant let go of there broken gun. 
---
They have already removed the explosive prefix on energy weapons that's what they meant 2 years ago. Look it up.
---
Games remove problem issues like broken guns like I stated before cause its unhealthy for the game. 
---
Them removing them would mainly only make dupers butthurt. Legacy dropped at launch and I can almost guarantee you 75% of players who got a legacy didnt realize or care how powerful it would be and likly have stopped playing (alot of people stopped playing at launch) most of the player base doesnt go on reddit.
---
Sure people who didnt dupe would be upset but imo tough. Yes It sucks but its unhealthy for the game. 
---
Needs of the many out weigh needs of the few.
---
5.56 and .308 ammo types. The ammo machine seems to make 5.56 the fastest out of all the ammo types and that's what I usually have bulk of in my vendors. Sells all the time. And remember, ammo is always 1 cap.
---
Script is the only really controllable ‚Äúlooter shooter‚Äù element of the game atm. You get 150 a day selling off garbage *, **, and *** but you can get another ~50 a day if you do all of the dailies.
---
I typically do the full SCORE grind at 11a CT (when they reset) and then I sell off junk and water for caps, treasury notes for bullion, and legendaries for script at 7p followed by a 20-30m run doing my daily chores for that extra ~50 script.
---
Because you never get anything good from 200 script I horde it until I have close to 1000 and then burn it all at once at the purveyor.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much end game content as far as I can tell. I sometimes run Earle or SBQ just for fun but since even those aren‚Äôt guaranteed *** it hardly seems worth it to prioritize them. (I banked over 300 treasury notes during the last meat week and have now gotten to the point that I don‚Äôt really need bullion much anymore either unless I want to be a completionist about the plans I don‚Äôt care about).
---
Those sound more like achievements. I've never died in any of those ways.
---
It was a teaser for wastelanders
---
My buddy got it but he's not a base builder, idk if he read it or not
---
So this is probably a stupid question: How the heck does the ammo converter work? I built one in my CAMP (I've just hit 40 this week and don't really mess around with the CAMP related stuff just yet) yesterday and didn't really know what to do with it.
---
I'll stop by after work, and then I gotta finish building my camp!
---
You'd be surprised then. Probably 1/4 of the rage comments still come from people who have never played the game or bailed on BETA but still think their opinions are valid.
---
So you just rehashed what I said...guess you really don't know shit.
---
This kind of suggestion benefits from sufficient lead up time, as it would flake time to get reviewed, discussed, and coded. 
---
It‚Äôs not like putting up decorations three months early. ;)
---
Well thanks for sharing.
---
I'm just focusing on your son being 9 and being allowed to play Fallout 4 and 76. Honestly. Based.
---
I've seen them in the forest and I've seen them in the mire
---
I was on the fence about which console to get this next gen. Looks like it's going to be an Xbox.
---
Buy lunch boxes and rank up, same thing.
---
So I guess I can start expecting a shit load of crashes on my PS4
---
Decontamination arch? Or the damn legendary perk
---
It's also only a coin to change perks.  So for one level up you can swap, make a shit ton of ammo, then swap back.  With the update I'm leveling up much, much faster anyway
---
Anyone else see this as a bad thing? Like when Bioware went to EA and Bungie got bought and turned into 343?
---
It's never good when creatives sell themselves, and it's not like they needed the money...
---
Lol. Someone‚Äôs using a Vampire‚Äôs weapon and not getting enough damage out of it.
---
Pretty sure they will eventually fix the glaive to work with ff after a patch or two but I agree the slow is really nice debuff, just wish the animation for attack was a bit more diverse than just a spear reskin feel.
---
To be honest, I never understood why unyielding is a thing
---
You‚Äôre welcome!  Pay it forward!
---
It was a joke but thanks for the mansplaning it for me üòâ
---
Wtf how do you get this?!
---
I mean I was planning on preordering the XsX tomorrow anyway...but this definitely seals the deal for me....
---
Understand, I didn't think about that 'not having the plan yet' in this caseüòâ
---
This might actually get me back into the game. MS has been very committed to being competitive with regards to content and trying to win over users, also no longer being owned by some lameass hedge fund is also a bonus. Likely a bigger push on content and building the user base and less focus on milking users for stupid shit like additional storage.
---
That's a hell of an edit. Are you ok?
---
I‚Äôm sure all the games already out will be ok but I wonder if this becomes a big FU to Sony going forward for any new games and if they‚Äôll be exclusive?  That would be big.
---
Bold you to assume my gender.
---
Any way to narrow that down?  Any particular location?  Are they only out a night?  Dusk?
---
It‚Äôs a Daily Ops reward, both are separate though so you‚Äôd have to be lucky to get it in a full set.
---
This. Basically you get access to see the actual vault door.

At night I always find them in the Toxic area with Crater. Name is slipping my mind atm. But near the cooking event daily

Gets my vote.  Because of bear arms I run around with a small nations supply of heavy weapons since my stash would be maxed out otherwise.  Prime one of them for easier ammo crafting and run the other one on the regular ammo you pick up while playing.
---
I guessing these blood eagles prob sleep with a fart pillow too..

I mean they also own inXile. Idk how publishing rights work with this and who owns the properties, etc., But it isn't absolutely crazy to think maybe inXile could make an isometric Fallout or help to remaster the original two
---
Yep, exactly the same. tedious but it's done now
---
South east of 76, in the region between the vault and the airport if I remember correctly

It was a pre wastelands teaser to unravel a government conspiracy that was the construction of vault 79 and the secret contents within, was just a cool little unmarked quest

The guitar playing has become annoying to say the least.  If only she could p-lay different songs.  Also she's at my camp now go and take her away:)

Microsoft is buying Zenimax for 7.5 Billion in cash.
---
You are taking into account the +25 score to each level, yes?
---
There's an unmarked bird lookout in the hills to the north of Aaron Homestead and to the West of The Crosshair.. spawns about 8-10 fireflies.
---
Looks like Microsoft have just purchased ZeniMax Media for $7.5 Billion USD, so all the studios under ZeniMax (Bethesda, Id, etc.) will follow.
---
Slightly better qa?
---
Oh.  I don't know how to feel about that then.
---
Did you try Iss melee yet? My Iss DCG is performing awesome compared to Bss.
---
They would still lose money if they‚Äôre selling a cheaper subscription
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôll probably move down there once I‚Äôm a high enough level.
---
Rookie question, but what happens if your camp is within a blast zone?
---
me too, fo76 was absolute garbage even with the last update, and i felt the series is coming to an end, but these news, it puts a smile on my face :)
---
No that's it. My da
---
I‚Äôd be fine with scrap kits too
---
You need to work on your reading comprehension skills if that is what you think.  In no uncertain terms your post was mostly wrong because you were only blaming a singular dupe for instability.  Devs have stated that you are wrong
---
It just works.
---
Sat there for 48 in-game hours.  Nothing.  Do they spawn every night or just sometimes?
---
Yeah but as a PS4 player it might not count for much
---
Microsoft owns Todd. Please fire him. It just works.
---
If you have the eye boggle glasses they look hilarious with this combo
---
I thought that was the point of the vanguard set?
---
I‚Äôm saying nerf legacy explosive effect like they nerfed the explosive effect for the rest of 2 years ago. 
---
Legacy are OP cause they kept the full damage of the explosive effect.
---
Would be nice, not to mention it should have been obvious when adding these to the game that a lot players would have saved a bunch of level ups since there was no point before, if you were happy with your build.
---
Try against the bosses, it's just unusable!
---
Really? Always spawned there for me, so unless they've been patched out, I dont know... :(
---
Will log on later and have a look, my CAMP is up near there.
---
Thanks for that **lostbytes** I'm looking for some now, I really enjoy it when I need/want something and then going out and searching.
---
Off to Mrs Mumble today also üëç
---
FALLOUT NV 2
---
Absolutely, completely the wrong way to fix and probably not even possible as the weapon gets the damage from the explosive affix tag on the weapon, so you aren't changing explosive damage on it without changing it on all weapons without requiring a massive reworking of the entire weapon generation system which I could only imagine breaks 25% of in game weapons. 
---
Best option they have is just making sure that their code is tightened and doesn't allow for more duplicates and get better access to player inventory systems that would allow them to see things like 1000 duped b2525s and suspend or wipe accounts with large numbers of obviously duped items because if you stop the RMT hordes of items on mules and there's no way for more to be made then over time majority of these will just slowly phase out of the ecosystem as players leave or items get lost/destroyed accidently.
---
I never died in fo76, also irl.

Haha this made me laugh more than it should. Y‚Äôall Sony boys gonna be simpin us Xbone gods.

To be honest most diseases don't even bother you apart from parasites, that bar drops fast

Because it‚Äôs a chest mod just like dense or asbestos lining.

You can‚Äôt always have your cake and eat it.

Yawn

What the fuckin fuck!!?!!

Soooo, does this means we get New Vegas 2?
---
No, there are many new weapons.  The chainsaw is one of them.
---
Stretch.
---
you're laughing. A console is dead and you're laughing.
---
Not really a good thing at all.
---
Probably one of the worst possible outcomes.
---
Hahaha, I just started using my plasma caster again because of this, 2-3 shots to kill a mutant, then pick up 16 cartridges.
---
Xbox ‚Äò-‚Äò
---
Yes please. I‚Äôd love this game at 60 FPS.
---
"X" is now VATS.
---
Thx for the advice
---
Thx
---
Honestly no I feel like zenimax needs to be put in check because of all they‚Äôre dumb practices also both obsidian AND inexile are under Xbox which both contain ex interplay and Black Isle members so them working on fallout is now a lot more likely
---
Ha no I‚Äôm all in for all the jokes coming. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs this simple. I‚Äôm not businessman but this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Sony doesn‚Äôt get future games. Or it could mean that I have no clue. But look at Minecraft that Microsoft owns.
---
To be fair, the anecdote about the thousand-point exclusive gamerscore he got from Microsoft was a cute anecdote. :D
---
Just last week was wondering about the possibilities if MS backed Fallout. !! 
---
Fuck this is HUGE. I am very happy.
---
GG MS!!
---
If FO5 is xbox exclusive, I just.... I can't think about that. Really really really hope that doesn't happen
---
Tuesday November 24th, at 12 noon ET.
---
That‚Äôs exactly ten weeks from when it started. Bethesda has said each season will be ten weeks long.
---
There will also be a Double Score Event Nov 17-23, which will help those needing an eleventh hour push.
---
That is beautiful.
---
are you with fire proof rank3?
---
After further test it seems that only immune to explosion with the perk
---
I don't like this at all. 
---
I don't trust microsoft one bit with handling any game studio. They ruined Forza. They ruined halo. 
---
Jesus fuck this is bad
---
Perfect, thanks
---
lol. salty
---
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more...
---
My FAVORITE from that game.
---
I think tuesday ends week 1 of a 10 week cycle.
---
How so? Not disagreeing or agreeing, just curious because I don‚Äôt know what to think of this whole thing.
---
Yeah exactly, ive recently rolled a b25 caster and that thing shreds. 2 shots to kill the mutants and i pick up 8-16 rounds. Thats just amazing!
---
I 100% believe that later this month that the rest of the new F76 content is delayed until 2021. Bethesda has lost many players from the delays of the "A Colossal Problem"  Event, and Fractured Steel DLC. 
---
They also lost millions when 400k fallout 1st subscriptions were cancelled from the Faschnadt Parade Event Delay. 
---
For Microsoft, just keeping a schedule, making fixes, and keeping players is worth more then 7.5 B. You have to realize all these games are going to be better with more team members and more money. 
---
So happy Bethesda is gone, what a joke they were. Have u/Ladydevann send that up to their management team to take a look at how a company takes care of it's customer base.
---
I wouldn't bet on it. For one. The current team at obsidian is made up of only 20% of the team that made nv. 
---
And Microsoft isnt gonna take the game away from bethesda and give it to another dev just because. 
---
May be a possibility of obsidian and bethesda working together on one but it is doubtful.
---
Here I will quote myself: 
---
 "It was found to have no effect on the servers until you had over 1000 unique items in it."
---
Seems you missed key important details. So who's reading comprehension skills are lacking? I am bored with you now, begone.
