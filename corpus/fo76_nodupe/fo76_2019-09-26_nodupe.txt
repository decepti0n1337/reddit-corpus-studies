Kinda doing once per day for the score u know
---
---
---
Honestly daily ops and the new legendary ammo perk overshadow it now .
---
Ah, well, I now NEED the Clean Mr. Handy Fuel.
---
Had this same problem.
---

---
Solution: Get sludge lung, then acquire a second disease while you still have sludge lung.  That worked for me.
---
Why do they even have a limit on caps üòÖ
---
Is it so that even buying the serum recipes are a grind or something? That's the only reason I can think of, nothing else costs a significant amount of caps.
---
Yeah I would love to have just a vault suit as an outfit.
---
My new main is a bloodied unyielding heavy gunner that uses vampire weapons. Without any aid buffs, my intelligence is LVL 56, no shortage of XP for me.
---
Agreed.  I dropped a lvl 30 some Sri packs and a lvl 500 something snatched them.  Way to be a dick
---
I mean... Most of us are working from home...
---
Ppl have no idea what to do ,like in many events they either don‚Äôt listen to the instructions or don‚Äôt read the side bar. I understand language barriers and what not but from my experience no one reads the side bar. For anything, ever.
---
He probably has a giant red stamp that says ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù.
---
One of the drawbacks of not having a chat. I've seen this a few times, it is frustrating.
---
Junk in your scrap box doesn‚Äôt take up weight
---
that's what I figured, just wanted some secondary opinions.
---
Hmm... What does microsoft think about this "No Fun Allowed" thing?
---
Yes please
---
I have been know to delete their station at my camp

Doesn't bother me. I never said that it did. I'm merely asking why they felt compelled to buy it immediately instead of get it over time. When clearly if you're spending that kind of money you're clearly invested so I'd imagine you'd finish the run regardless.
---
Survival Shortcut takes away the need for eating or drinking completely.
---
I could be unpopular because that‚Äôs not why people play fallout. 
---
Anyway this just you ranting about what you think. You don‚Äôt really know what they do or do not analyze.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, thank you for the offer though, much appreciated. I thought the same thing about how fun these ops can potentially be with the right crew, have everyone know their role right off the bat, no fumbling around. Having builds that compliment one another and just bring synergy to the team.
---
Well I am In power armor anyway so I use my light all the time in the ops.So not sure why it is no working for me.
---
25% xp boost per use and they stack up to 4....used with certain foods, leader/intelligence bobbles, and magazines its very close to Double Xp. You can buy them from the dude who stands near the gold vendor at Foundation.
---
Yeah xbox controllers auto turn off after 10 mins, but with a cord plugged in on the top, it never shuts off.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I said. If you run PA your INT is 15.
---
&gt;So it wasn't that the raids were bad it's like you said, they don't seem to have asked "why" wasn't it working out and instead just removed them.
---
The entire foundation of Daily Ops was based on "What did we do wrong with the Vault Raid?"
---
Next week on the 29th or 30th.
---
Im never gonna get an answer am I?
---
Vampire heavy gunner PA builds are the new meta cheese builds. They're also the choice of most of the people who try and silence any legitimate complaints about p22.. cos if they can't die then everything else *must* be perfectly balanced üòâ
---
I've checked there and haven't gotten a response
---
YES! And I'll name her Dotty after my mom. Together we will lay waste...um...more waste to the wasteland... üôÇüëç
---
This
---
This was also a theory of mine.
---
Nothing mentioned on the bugs in the game and how they are working to solve it once and for all? Omg
---
76 will benefit from increased power of next gen whether or not they ‚Äúoptimize it‚Äù
---
Hi, I'm the guy who posted the Please Stop Killing My Com post, and yes, guys and girls, please stop killing my cow :(
---
My ammo is 1 cap per piece, cores are under 50, all legendaries that isn't a 3 starred Bloodied/Junkies/TS/AA and Unyielding/Vanguard is under 500, all plans aside from Wendigo plushy/rug/heads are at 5 caps, so I'm pretty sure my stuff isn't offensively expensive.
---
At least people can't kill my chickens, Jeffrey and Jacob.
---
They boost your XP and give you a bonus.
---
See above.
---
Then yea it should get magic damage procs if you run the highest fire rate barrel.
---
&gt;I had to use diluted radaways and toxic goo to stablize my rads every 15 minutes before, as all non stealth bloodied builds have to. It gets very boring as you can imagine. Since you're a full health player you have no way of knowing what keeping your rads at 80% is like and therefore you shouldn't really be telling me what's good for me and what isn't.
---
Use your big boy reading skills to find the answer, sound out the words if you have to.
---
Well we will automatically get better frame rates and load times without any special patch so that alone will help tons
---
But why? I mean you do you but leveling 3 times doesn't prevent you from getting SCORE tomorrow. Plus you'll get the repeatable xp SCORE.
---
Does it even yield PA paints Is my question....
---
Like I ‚Äúheard‚Äù the method &amp; blahzay.
---
But can you get rare plans,like if I sink caps into documents....can I get PA paints,&amp; possibly...a BOS outfit or two.
---
Would it just be a cap loss?
---
‚ÄúInquiring minds want to know‚Äù
---
Easy killer. I wasn't *calling them out*. I was merely asking why.
---
There are scripts running on this sub to auto downvote all new posts. Just FYI
---
I already levels up three times this week
---
That's cool you two chase each other like that and motivate one another.
---
Every 5 levels is a perk pack &amp; every level awards a perk point....cant go wrong. Perk coins towards legendary perks and goodies from the board game...work smarter not harder!! My wife plays every night...i got her so addicted üòÜ
---
Happy cake day!
---
Why? It has zero mods and only makes armor incredibly bulky looking. It would make far more sense for it to be an outfit like the Army Fatigues
---
Geez, I don't normally care about that kinda thing. But damn.
---
I dun see why they need to bind the items... its not logical. We should b able to trade n sell or gift it away. Make no sense.
---
Only sense is they wan u to play with the mules account to get wat u wan. Its a trap mechansim.
---
Keep your hands off that US property mutie.
---
(Pets would be cool but depends on how implemented. Wouldn't really want to see every person running around with a deathclaw).
---
It does have mods
---
I'm lucky enough to not have encountered this at all but man I bet it's frustrating
---
U cant even wear underarmor into the PA. Think about it. Logical?
---
Yeah exactly. But now that you can farm XP anywhere... it just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
I had pretty much same build as you but made a few tweaks to enhance power armor and I also got lucky and found both an AA Gatling Laser and a Vamp Ultracite Gatling Laser and I‚Äôve been able to pretty easily solo them.  I can get Paladin without much effort and Elder depending on the challenges, with 1 decent teammate I can generally get Elder first try.  I was going for a Fixer VATS PA build initially so if you have that or a decent Handmade you could potentially create that setup without altering your Commando too much.  Just some food for thought if you want a fairly easy Ops setup.  Best of luck!
---
This is the oddest complaint yet
---
What sucks is im a heavy guns build. I cant trade legendary glaives to others who can use it. I dont want to get bogged down by another untradable roll. I‚Äôm really getting tired of the new weapons being untradable.
---
Love the look but please make the floor go in one direction it's killing me lol
---
Welcome... more frustration to come. Been playing this and seeing no improvement in bug fixing and logic fixing. I get more frustrated everyday
---
Can the other daily ops plans be traded?
---
"I think i got blessed or groped or something."
---
I'm fucking dying ü§£üò≠üòÇ
---
Welcome aboard!
---
Add me on PC ign: Azulake, if I catch you playing I'll drop by and help out with any quests and events you have.
---
Even tho I don't have any legendaries for you, and can't get anymore due to recent updates, I can't craft you 200% sets of armor all the way to level 50 until you get some decent legendary gear.
---
HMU, I play mostly on Asian evenings (GMT +8) so if you're Aussie or from that region, see you soon!
---
Well ok. I level up 3 times a day and just collect the repeatable xp SCORE.
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm too busy heart emoting Chally to even turn in my meat in time
---
I‚Äôve said this as well. Just add the functionality to the camp terminal. Set it to a weekly timer and boom.
---
[deleted]
---
And it wouldn't make sense putting armor on it only not to see the armor and Bethesda is keeping it like that they fixed the issue with no armor showing on it
---
Yeah, fuck people like that ‚Äúwhat do you mean I actually have to contribute?‚Äù
---
A lot of the magic weapons I got that I tested previous patch 22 are no longer magic, so there may be some left but I believe most have been fixed.
---
Some people are just selfish jerks. This happens to me every time I try to help out a lower level.
---
I feel bad for everyone having no drops. I know of no "Good Luck" rituals since she's a fickle Lady.
---
Hop on the drums and put a rubber band on your thumb stick so you don‚Äôt get kicked.
---
I like shotguns for this reason: I can switch from tagging to execution just by using vats or not
---
Shame about the next gen upgrades. At least throw some visual upgrades in. I know load times are server based so not like that can be sped up with an SSD. But you would think they would at least give some higher quality assets and compress the game file size a bit for SSD.
---
Yesterday I had to try three daily ops teams before I found one that actually wanted to do daily ops.
---
I don't know if they create the team and then just don't go, or if they've already finished and didn't quit or change the team type.
---
What works best for you,
---
I switched to a shotgun build because I have a great shotgun and can easily swap perk cards across to be best in it.
---
The living room floor I can fix! the rest I can't lol wont let me
---
Yes, and sold.
---
Thanks for the tip. I actually hadn't thought aboit sorting that way to find peoples unique experiences with the game. Some i love and wouldn't change but it is helpful to see if anyone else has discovered and/or experienced odd buggs.
---
Actually those will work... if you have a melee wealpn equipped when you throw it. Not very, useful but there ya go.
---
Oh right, forgot to disclose the gum. I counted that as a perk of getting a pack
---
I once caught a glimpse of a Bloodied LMG buried in a bunch of meat piles that is under another bunch of ash piles in Radiation Rumble.
---
I never found that sweet spot again and it haunts me to this day.
---
people will be sick of having these plans drop very soon.
---
Z and C do the same thing on PC.  Very touchy though.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people have a hard time with that lol. The whole purpose is to make vats harder, it‚Äôs like their version of a squid shooting ink.
---
Okay, this took me way too long to realize. 
---
Good trolling job. You had me for a while!
---
At least the loot needs to glow like nearly all other games in which a person can find it.
---
I also noticed that loot now floats in the air again from scor beasts and sometimes simply goes underground if there is another part of the landscape in it, like rocks over rocks meshes, and the loot pile drops down to the lower one.
---
After seeing the Dev Jeff interview and him saying they took an old engine, added networking and waited to see what broke, it is not surprising so much is broken or breaking or lacking in this game.
---
Maybe Microsoft will hire better developers and get the game back on track. then again, maybe not.
---
lol there is no skill involved in this game. You either have gear that is good enough or you don‚Äôt.
---
TBH honest I may use it as a caps generator. I sell a lot of 5.56 and. 45 in my vendor. I pretty much use the Ammo Converter to generate my plasma cartridges.
---
Trolling? I merely forgot to  leave out the gum. But yes I think it would be good to have scaling packs
---
On a side note, i think it'd be cool to see the behemoths treated like war elephants for the super mutants.  Instead of a sack full of boulders, have abpair of muties on the behemoths back launchi g missiles and firing miniguns.  How funny would it be to see the behemoth grab a mutie and throw it at you like it was a boulder.
---
SHUT UP AND SPEND MORE MONEY ON ATOMS
---
And show the number of unique plans they're selling. I don't care that they have 86 different copies of Mounted Squirrels.
---
Sure thing, bud. 
---
Have a great night!
---
I thought this only happened to me. I‚Äôve tried going in and out of vats as people have suggested and that doesn‚Äôt help either.
---
It just baffles me because there were plenty of drums open so they could‚Äôve done nothing and still contributed
---
Fair enough, guess I'll live in internal anger :)
---
That‚Äôs when you nuke their camp
---
Also Bad is when someone joins the Team. And either is low level and does nothing. Or the Person joins the Team and just stands at the entrance. Even if i die and it Costs time. If a Person stands a minute at the enteence and does nothing i kick him.
---
Noice.
---
Those sell pretty quickly, even though i use them I always cave 1500 at my vendor and the ammo machine produces enough for me and to keep my vendor stocked
---
Clean up trash! Put out brush fires! Pick up Chally‚Äôs poop and prepare the ingredients for Chally‚Äôs feed! Lots to do, as a lvl70 I‚Äôm never useful on extermination duty.
---
I could certainly see a YouTuber paying to get through it for the sake of showing off what it entails.
---
Already sick of them. Got them on 2 characters, that aren't now, and never will be, melee. If they were trade-able they would be a great drop.
---
Am I the only one disappointed when it turns out that there is beer in the punch bowl instead of nukashine?
---
Time for a visit.
---
Some of the commies wear it too
---
I wonder if they‚Äôll have a purpose in the future, because right now I believe none of them are actually named.
---
Yes, because every time I want to point at something I have to place a camp, a wall, and a light up arrow.
---
and yet instead of applying that to the actual raids they just removed and replaced them with a totally different game mode.  
---
Maybe we could have had our cake and eaten it too and gotten daily ops + better vault raids?
---
So annoying to listen to my teammates doing cool stuff, clearing Wes Tek,  ect while earning almost  no xp. Oh, and thanks for all the f-ing missiles!
---
Therapy and medication can also be effective if combined with healthy lifestyle changes.
---
I guess it depends on what you mean by "a lot."
---
I seriously haven't been going out of my way to grind.  I don't use Lunchboxes on myself.  I don't hit West Tek over and over again.  I don't do a lot of the things I did back in Season One.  And yet, I'm already at Rank 40 (which is, thanks to the ridiculous SCORE scaling, a little over 25% of the event cleared).
---
I finished Season 1 just after its midway point.  It was clear I didn't have to go as fast as I did.  But, in my defense, we also *didn't know* what Bethesda was going to do with double events, double SCORE, simply adding more events, or whether or not the XP repeatable was subject to change.  Most of those have already been accounted for in Season 2.
---
Yeah all the possible rewards remain the same. There's also still a chance to lose all your data in one go, if not done correctly. It was a good way to clear out the 50 I had leftover
---
I think they think it gives extra xp to Daily missions and not daily ops
---
The vats prefix makes a huge difference for shotguns where as in games it traditionally spreads pellets in poor accuracy. But every pellet that hit its target thanks to Fallout's VAT system.
---
So for that reason I dont think it's magic, I think it's acting exactly how it was designed to do. But it definitely demolishes enemies
---
Appreciate the response. I‚Äôm always open to discussing my findings.
---
 I‚Äôve done quite a bit of field testing with the awareness perk on to get a sense of just how beefy the enemies are now. My main take away so far is that armor penetration matters way more than now it used to, since level 100 enemies have a ton of DR. The reason you‚Äôre needing more bullets is that they‚Äôre sponging the crap out of all our shots with a ton of armor and higher health. 
---
Enemy armor resistance doesn‚Äôt seem to scale linearly. The difference between hitting an enemy with 1 DR vs. 2 DR is a lot bigger than I thought it would be when using the same weapon. So an enemy with 100 DR is going to be that much tankier. I‚Äôve been able to make adjustments by prioritizing armor penetration on my guns. It seems to matter a lot more than it used to. 
---
I agree that hitting weak spots seems a lot more important too, and the range drop off feels a lot more punishing now as a result of the new enemy scaling.
---
Right! The 4/5 missiles at the end are just the.... icing on the cake? Like yes give me 10 extra weight that I‚Äôll never use because missile launchers are useless?
---
There are shortcuts already.
---
O - Radio
---
J - Quests
---
I - inventory
---
Those 3 are the only ones I use, but I'm sure there is also one for checking your stats.
---
If you meant for the sub menus as well, then AFAIK there aren't any, the ones listed above open your last-opened sub menu from their respective sections.
---
Exactly. It doesn‚Äôt need to be some grand thing, just information to see what sold and at what price.
---
I have never had any interest in PvP. However, I respect that some people like it and the developers should try to satisfy them since they sold this as a partially PvP game.
---
I think part of PvP's unpopularity is that there isn't a simple opt-in, opt-out mechanic. Pacifist kinda does that, but not really; you can still get killed at workshops etc. They should make it as simple as an on/off switch for PvP. If it's off you're safe, and if it's on it's like the old survival mode. No separate server needed.
---
Yeah that's kind of the point. The idea we should be okay with just getting by or just enough is something i see so much from this community. The Fallout bubble is kind of crazy to me, as someone who plays other games and see what other studios are able to accomplish. 
---
Your statement - It's like saying "half of society wants a good environment and the other half wants good education, just pick one damnit".
---
Why?
---
I don‚Äôt have any TSE Weapons but explosive weapons (normal guns with the legendary effect, not launchers) don‚Äôt seem to have taken nearly as big a hit in general. I‚Äôd like to get my hands on a couple TSE‚Äôs to take a closer look though.
---
Thanks alot.. I noticed some in my inventory and I used one , saw all the bells and whistles but wasnt sure what was happening lol
---
Keep checking daily, when you get there, someone may have bought it your rng didn‚Äôt spawn it for the day.
---
Yeah, what you described is an experience i think most of us have had.
---
Maybe access the log through the personal terminal or something?
---
TIL. That challenge has been bugged for me since the beginning. I will have to give this a shot.
---
Me and another person have just been robbed of an 8 minute run. Had an enemy get stuck in a wall for a few minutes and suddenly appear else where. As I am typing this we are currently stood waiting for the boss to arrive, its been 2 minutes.
---
AAE Combat for DPS.  AAE Pump for single shot potential.  If you have the shells to waste then the Combat is probably better, but it‚Äôll break a lot compared to the pump.
---
Two shots were painfully nerfed a long time ago along with most extended mag mods.
---
If I‚Äôm correct they are part of a mission.
---
It will yield the BoS plans and apparel
---
Good luck, hope it works for you :)
---
Yeah, I saw a camp next to meat week with the greenhouse and a BoS bunker. It's not how I want to spend my money, but at least I got a sneak preview.
---
That BoS bunker has a steam effect on the doorway that makes it look like there's a hidden decontamination arch inside.
---
[removed]
---
It would be great if Daily Ops worked. Just lost an 8 minute round due to an enemy getting stuck in the wall and then waiting 2 minutes for the boss to arrive.
---
Sorry to hear that bud. I‚Äôm just reporting what I see. I know you guys got hit hard with the perks/buffs calculation.
---
I'm ootl, what is this pipe thing?
---
Lets be real, if these were made tradeable, there would be 0 reason to do daily ops. Some people were lucky enough, like myself to get it on like my 2nd or 3rd op, but it's a way to artificially extend the life through RNG of what would otherwise be DOA for most people. I'm not supporting it but thats most likely why.
---
Exactly.  Also bizarre that most comments seem to agree but still my post is downvoted.  This reddit sometimes \*chuckles\*
---
I just recorded myself making 270,000 EXP in 25 minutes, and plan on editing it to be more socially friendly onto YouTube.
---
Whitesprings-WestTec-National Isolated Radio Array-harpers ferry- the burrows.
---
Coming from the console to PC, it‚Äôs definitely far more stable on PC, but it‚Äôs absolutely hilariously bad on the consoles.
---
Check Graham. If he doesn't have it the first time, keep checking back.
---
Give me the raw footage
---
Uh, there's always a daily ops objective in the SCORE dailies, so no, the war glaive plans aren't the only reason to do the Ops.  Wouldn't be doing it on my commando and heavy weapons characters if it were.
---
You lucked out mine is level 15, and I was level 300 something when I got it. Feelsbadman.
---
I doubt it was intended that way. In terms of the mechanic itself, maybe its not the worst idea, but in terms of design, it just doesn't make any sense. If you were hunting a giant frog and it dropped eggs on the floor, are you really gonna target the eggs? Maybe if you're fighting hypnotoad. If they wanted to implement a vats hindrance, they could've added a smoke effect. That would make way more sense.
---
yep, got the caged light plans yesterday and they sold within 15 minutes of me putting them up on my vending machines
---
Not sure if this is a ‚Äúnew meta‚Äù per se, but this is a pretty standard looking build more or less for Bloodied Heavy PA and definitely is great.
---
...Members....
---
Yeah, this is the new normal.
---
Level 50 is high enough to get max level enemies everywhere, but still low enough that you haven't really optimized your build and your gear. It's probably the point in the game right now where you feel least powerful. Don't worry though, it gets easier as you build your character.
---
SCORE isnt an always present thing. Until people hit 100, sure they could that if they wanted to but it's much easier to get score now than it was in season 1 because of One Wasteland. I'm not saying the plans shouldn't be tradeable so don't take it like I am, but if they were tradeable, it would not have an incentive for people to do it if they could just trade for it. Like anything, the plans and outfits will soon saturate the market and be worthless, and thus so will daily ops.
---
Edit: but since there is a non tradeable plan, its possible someone will never get it, and thus keep playing it.
---
What mission? Or is it not in the game yet?
---
Just my kind of excessive reaction. I heartily approve.
---
Fire in third-person view, you won't need an FFR effect.
---
Thank you so much!! I‚Äôm leveling up decently fast since everything is level 50 so at least that‚Äôs good.
---
Depends on your house style I guess. My main has a stone walled fortress on a clifftop. My baby has a barn-walled shack.
---
No its a legacy gatling plasma....
---
The best thing about bows is the perk points you get scrapping the cards. But yes I feel your pain. Reminds me of the gauss VATS bug, and that's been around a long time. I wish you luck though
---
Of course you would have told everyone that you are a vegan.
---
Did some testing.. Crafted 4 Fixers, each with exact same mods except magazines. Did some dummy shooting at behemoth (5 times with each magazine to be sure). And made sure to start firing immediately after targetting with vats so there would be no targetting drain involved.
---
Swift 15 shots fired before running out of AP
---
Piercing 14
---
Stinging 13
---
Perforating 13 (but the left over AP was lower than with stinging)
---
So there is a difference between every single one of them. So what are the actual % reductions/increases in the AP cost? Would have to ask someone who can dig up current info from files.
---
Maybe the did. Maybe the said ‚ÄúWhy did we ever add PVP to start with?‚Äù
---
They were announced on release, those posters in the train stations are the free add ons. But now I guess it‚Äôs a secret. The excavator is more a secret hidden quest.
---
And on a side note, in the train stations, take a look at the map. You can click on all the pinned locations. It tells you where all the other train stations are.
---
And keep an eye on that poster board. Some train stations have papers clipped to it for more quests!
---
I had both types of ammo on my legacy when I changed it to prime receiver, if I change it back to standard and then to prime again will that fix it?
---
All I want are the War Glaive and Symptomatic plans. Instead I have 4(!) copies of the Burrows signs.
---
Entitlement. Entitlement never changes...
---
Someone killed the grafton monster at grafton day without letting anyone else tag it.  You bet your ass I was in that silo the second the event ended.
---
I elder it every day solo. So far have some sign plans and the symptomatic thingy.
---
That‚Äôs a good signal!
---
That's why you wait for the empty loot piles to despawn  while spamming the collect button after 10-15 mins the garne starts to remove ash piles
---
If you're trying to be heavy guns or handmade, I suggest picking one of the two.
---
For some reason the video automatically increases its speed as it progresses. (So I'll be editing that to slow down)
---
It's going to take about an hour to upload.
---
I do not care supply me with the footage
---
The only time I really have trouble with it is in PA. Turn that headlamp on and anything closer than three feet is so blown out I can barely see.
---
Edit: AFAIK, there is no way to change it. I have even messed with the config files quite a bit but no luck.
---
Buy some toilet paper for 30k, you don't know when you're going to need it.
---
 I hat athena come to my camp recently and they talked it was cool.
---
The scout events like campfire tales can give you badges, but it's a low-ish percentage chance. I have gotten badges from campfire tales and from operation tidy (in the toxic valley) but never from stings and things.
---
I‚Äôm thinking if the enclave returns they‚Äôre going to reprogram MODUS to not be insane. I think he‚Äôs crazy even for the enclave. And I think the West Virginian enclave is a little less crazy then the West coast enclave
---
That‚Äôs where my camp it‚Äôs located. It pisses me off that I camp spawn my camp because of the event
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy once you do it a few times. I run and repair the signal, ignoring enemies. Always ignore them. Then run straight to the first signal booster and start it and wait. Here‚Äôs where you can kill mobs, but watch the timer and get ready to boogy when the timer hits. Run to to the next one and repeat. And then run to the last spot, wipe out those punks and then bumrush the boss going HAM on him.
---
is that how you can only get it?
---
I hope not. Modus‚Äô character and voice actor were awesome.
---
There‚Äôs just something about using HW and PA that I just can‚Äôt get behind. I haven‚Äôt worn PA since saving Preston in concord. In all honesty, as fun as ops are I‚Äôm not to concerned with doing them all the time. Currently I just run one when it‚Äôs a score challenge and then go do something else. I‚Äôll get all the plans and things eventually and I‚Äôve already got the two things I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted, the spec ops suit and the sympto-matic. Thanks for the info though, I‚Äôve already got a few decent awesome HW sitting in my stash like a v/ffr/fr .50cal and v/ffr/250dr plasma gat.
---
I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a meme that I don‚Äôt recognise...
---
Instanced camp builds but all builds share the same instance, with the potential for "intersecting builds"
---
That sounds amazing.
---
For a while I was trading in all 5.56, much like everybody else. When the market crashed because of the dupers. I had to sell. I sold 80,000 5.56 over a period of 2 weeks. Lol
---
My base has been getting pounded by Yao Gui all week, so I agree with you 100%. Every time I walk through my front door I have to see the health bar of my half-broken wall. Personally I think they should just reset to full health after a certain length of time, I don't see why it should keep track of each settlement item's individual durability.
---
A trader who's poor and over encumbered doesn't sound much like a trader to me.  Any successful trader wouldn't give a toss about fast travel costs.
---
Keep trying, not everyone is on all the time, but I can tell you they'll probably want to move these items before the event starts up and these items become more common from more sellers.
---
As someone who has tried (succeeded and failed) to buy and move items on that sub, it takes time. Unless you decide to offer something outrageously in another's favor.
---
I like the drums because you can turn the view 360 degrees and see what‚Äôs going on. On the spits you are locked into one view only (PC). But if the drums aren‚Äôt available, I get on the spits, if available. I just hate the ones that wander doing nothing when drums or spits are available.
---
Thanks for the tip! I always regarded the drug as fairly useless, but I‚Äôm surely mistaken.
---
Come on man, do some crack with me!
---
Wait...wrong reference....
---
The pink one you get from atomic shop, while regular colored mega sloth you can only get from Fasnacht
---
I see them everyday at white springs vendors.
---
Not at all. Most important thing is keeping bodies near the beacons. Any level can do that.
---
Is that an event?
---
Seems like way too many points in perception to me for a PA Heavy Build. I'm rocking that 1 point green thumb.
---
Oh I think he‚Äôll still exist but just not AS crazy. Still crazy though
---
Rad Resistant is a pretty worthless perk. Especially in PA.
---
This seems like a good build but meta is setting yourself up for criticism.
---
Doesn't fireproof still grant immunity to self explosive damage from ballistic weapons at rank 1 and 2, while the difference is hardly noticeable for the third rank.
---
Team medic is at its best when its being shared Imo, you can't share with that number of points in charisma.
---
Adrenaline 5 is really inefficient unless you live life on a constant rampage but 4 points might be asking a lot for a temporary difference of 36% for one point VS 60% for five.
---
Feel free to join, I'll be more than happy to stim you, just stay by the beacons.
---
You‚Äôd be helping them by joining becuase it‚Äôs more people to boost the uplinks
---
I play many PVP and PVE games. And here is the largest problem for me with PVP in adventure mode: it's not consensual.
---
I have no interest in PVP in a fallout game. I want to adventure and shoot super mutants with a few friends and nothing more. If you show up and start shooting us, you are just a jerk out trying to get your fun at the expense of other players fun.
---
This also leads into issues of balance as you mentioned. Even if I decide to drop everything in am doing and all of my current goals to engage in PVP, my PVE build stands no chance against a character specialized in killing players.
---
I am sorry, but the only people having fun in this type of "PVP" system are griefers getting their jollies out of fighting people that can't or choose not to fight back. If you are looking for real honest PVP with a fun challenging fight, why would you choose to play the mode where you might find that once a night rather than the mode where you can find a fun fight every few minutes?
---
If they wanted to encourage adventure mode PVP while still keeping players happy the best solution would be to create PVE only and PVP enabled adventure mode servers. That way those that don't want to PVP can avoid it and those that do want to PVP can know players they come up against also want to fight. Splitting the servers like that really is the best option to make everybody but the griefers happy. Or you can keep the servers as one but limit PVP to opt in system or specific area only.
---
Yeah this is annoying. At this point I just make a new one myself and then sit in the daily ops lobby (the first room you spawn into, before the timer starts) and wait there a couple of minutes. I usually manage to get one or two people joining me this way. Usually...
---
Still sitting on a ton of points, adjustment can be made on the fly.
---
Highlight effect works for me for about 3 minutes then just stops. 
---
  
---
I run the perk to make my chems last 2x longer too.. the INT buff stays around just fine
---
sometimes I lose the highlight effect after 30 seconds, it sucks
---
You're right. They are 15! Worse than I remembered! Unbelievable. Such trash that if you put it on you lose carry weight! Making it useless!
---
I thought about getting that, but I realized it doesn't make 2mm EC rounds, which is my main ammo right now, and .50 cal rounds takes like 10 hours for 200 rounds, which is ridiculously small for something used in a machine gun (I can go through that in a couple minutes).
---
Its much better for more common ammo types like .38, 5.56, 10 mm and the like where it can produce a couple hundred round per hour.
---
You are welcome to your opinion.
---
Yeah, they're paying 4/5ths of a legendary perk for that when what rads exists.
---
I love U guys...its becoming a meme...
---
In my experience, perception and charisma are borderline useless in a Heavy Build. I have 1 point and 5 points respectively in each. If it works for you though I am happy for you but if you want some improvements I can post my build. But I get each person has their own thing.
---
Unless you could repair them even if not destroyed. Solution; add that function or remove the notification entirely. It's dumbfounding to me but at least some folks agree. :)
---
Why not just use ammo factory on an alt?
---
Ok, so, I‚Äôm working on the presumption that it works the same way Fusion Cores and Plasma Cores work.  If you use it throughout the entire daily op you should get a supply at the end.
---
I‚Äôll test it later and see if I‚Äôm right.
---
My god I hate this update, kinda ruined the game for me. Sometimes I just want to get where I‚Äòm going and not have to be set upon by hordes almost my level. I‚Äòm constantly getting killed. Used to play for hours, now in 20 minutes I‚Äòm pissed off at how fucking boring and useless this game is now.
---
This is the best build I have ever seen.  
---
Hats off to you, my person.
---
Yep you are correct, relaxo. Shined myself twice and only teleported one per.
---
Yeah, It's just a recreational drug to see enemies fart.
---
I think charisma mileage varies depending on selflessness. If you really want to give your team a big boost it's good, but doesn't the charisma legendary perk not work with perk sharing?
---
Hardly a flex. 
---
Some of us have busy work lives; money is much easier to find than spare time. If you‚Äôve got the cash and want the items, go for it. 
---
You wouldn‚Äôt say that those who use dailies and weeklies to finish the scoreboard are flexing about how much free time they have, would you?
---
The afk tasks feel more productive than the rest since the credit pops up every couple seconds
---
I used stinging. Need that 5 extra ammo
---
It's, like, objectively worthless.
---
I think it has to do with people having more distractions right now. Many people have limited game time. So in that case, they are forced to choose between doing season stuff, daily ops, meat week stuff, and regular events. As a result, the regular events usually get left behind.
---
Drives me nuts. I caved to some egging and killed a player, they then leveled my CAMP. Most of it was destroyed but all these attached items in each building didn't so it's partial health bars everywhere I look. To those who say, just scrap it and replace it. I don't think those players are really into CAMP building like some of us are. It can take hours sometimes getting things lined up, glitching an object where you want it, creating different level flooring etc. Often to replace an effected item you also have to remove everything connected to it. Not always as easy as just scrap it and replace it so I don't get that argument at all.
---
I miss EDE
---
You are correct, it doesn't work to share perks.
---
That's the Primal Meat event, not the cook off.
---
The key is to tank the enemies with Emergency Protocols and a Vampire's weapon. Or diluted stimpacks. I only shoot while the objective bar is charging, then sprint to the next. I don't kill en route. I can get the final boss to spawn around the 6:00 mark and just hammer it. 
---
My heavy uses a VE 2 star .50 or bomb some stimpacks and unload with B/25/15 Gauss Minigun if I'm low on time. 
---
My commando build wears PA for Ops only and uses B2525 Primed Plasma Rifle with the flamer barrel. Melts the boss in under 15 seconds. I usually get more ultracite plasma than I spend and with maxed ammo factory, I make 540 cells per craft plus Super Duper.
---
I'm using T65 PA for both. Amazing tankiness.
---
Probably, that's because robots don't fart. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is not a life-and-death issue. Bethesda is under no obligation to do anything, but of course if they do nothing then they will lose players.
---
Thanks for the test. Would certainly be nice to have up to date files.
---
Even if it had much more limited functionality and utility, I'd love to see some Automatron features implemented. I understand that NPC followers would probably break the game or something, but I'd settle for just being able to build a robot ally that hangs around my Camp since you can't tame robots.
---
rubber-banding?
---
Same. 
---
But... 
---
My publisher is demanding I finish my next novel.

My family are demanding I spend time with them.

I dun mind exchange with U. I got a quad explosive one.
---
Yeah I got bos paladin paint.
---
They are entitled to build how they want regardless. Just let them be.
---
If you're talking about best as in most damage, BSC is still one of the hardest hitting builds
---
And jackass that I am, I keep it, because I know if I drop it I can‚Äôt get another one. So it sits in my stash taking up space.
---
Hey ya...
---
I feel a little bad about this one. I have my base very near to  Vault 76 and I have a ton of normal outfits in my vending machine at cheap prices, so new players can look good. Because as we all know, it is better to look good than to feel good. To help them feel good, I also try to keep a stock of enhanced underarmor, but that stuff sells fast. None of it is what a lot of shoppers want, though, so I feel a little bad.
---
It‚Äôs a luck thing, but yeah, some people avoid it because 1. No one ever takes a pylon, 2. The imposter is almost imposible to loot, 3. High probability of failing the event, such a pity, it‚Äôs a cool event
---
No
---
Can we see your legendary perks?
---
dam okay thanks
---
I had a base there for like a month and never noticed. And I do a Marsupial-enhanced cannonball into the pond after every Cookout and I never noticed. Way to make me feel dumb, man.
---
ETA: If you're going to cannonball into the pond, make sure you hit where it's deep enough. Nothing more embarassing than dying while trying to jump into the water.
---
No reason to feel bad I just went through a streak of seeing 10+ fasnacht masks per vendor and it reminded me of the turbo fert thing lol
---
I‚Äôm cool with placing apparel in vendors, I just want a distinction
---
Could I do it for 25 cobalt flux?
---
Yup - radstag steaks give 40 carry with carnivore.  Do pepperoni rolls give 60?
---
They are posted on that imgur link.
---
I do it every time I see it. I have it set up so that each one of my builds can tank all three pylons. Only a couple can kill her by himself üëç
---
PC isn't getting text chat, consoles have to suffer with crappy frames.  Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Me too, I have this drug in my favourite wheel for a long time. And I just remembered it today.
---
aw man that sucks, is this the only way for the fixer plan without spending caps for it?
---
if you want to start one wait until after ACP or scorched earth or the cookout. or if you join a server see how many people are in teams.
---
Are you saying that Bethesda focuses on PC players but ignores console players? I disagree - it's not Bethesda that made the perk loadout mod. Plus, PC players have no text chat unless they use a mod.
---
Or are you saying that Bethesda focuses on console players but not PC players? Again, I disagree - Bethesda keeps putting off perk loadouts. Plus, there's no next-gen console support.
---
Yes and sometimes no.
---
Yes if you're in the team but don't join the event.
---
Sometimes no if you do join the event but try to participate. It can be annoying having to watch over low levels given some expect you to revive them. For other people, just the idea of a low level effectively being dead weight leeching off the event is off-putting too.
---
This was what I was using: https://i.imgur.com/7ewTw0u.png
---
I really hate that we can't just wallpaper outside walls. Also, for a almost a week the game was acting weird and let me use the Mothman wallpapers without buying them. https://i.imgur.com/BR2rzw3.png Sadly I had to rebuild my camp cause my Ally was totally broken and the game finally figured out I didn't own the wallpapers. I really should log back in a take a pic of the new walls.
---
I run a max INT build with perks into the basic bloodied commando build because for me, endgame is basically just gaining more levels and getting those legendary perks maxed up. I find the content still pretty easy in all aspects and love that One Wasteland grants more experience overall.
---
How low are we talking here?  I had a 20 join today and with just he and I it didn‚Äôt work. As long as the team is full it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue but if it‚Äôs punchy robots and 3 low levels join it‚Äôs going to be a fail.
---
Thanks.
---
He is a guest in your camp, sir!
---
But yeah, this is annoying as hell. Commander DeGuerre likes to use the Tinker's Bench. I built one right next to her computer for her to use, but she insisted on walking across to my area to use my bench. What the hell.
---
It's an excuse for people to bitch, but it's literally there as a design mechanic. Online games as a service need consistent players, and this is one of the ways they get it. It's also there in case of exploits, to minimize damage. If people find ways to dupe etc things like that without any limits, then it fucks the game forever. Since it's an online game, they can't just "fix" it. They need to either roll back hours of everybody's progress (or in this game's case, months) to before the exploit was found, or go through individually removing things from everybody's accounts, which may not be possible if it's something that can be traded or spent. Warframe, one of the best examples in the industry, does the exact same thing for the exact same reasons. People bitching about this are either the kind to bitch about anything or just ignorant
---
See them ALOT on Grahm.
---
Yes but you can launch the event as many times as you want. Just buy new recall cards.
---
Encryptid is a joke if you are a PA user. Slap on Electric Absorbtion and as long as you keep your distance, it's laser beam attack does nothing. I tanked it the whole time on one event I did with 5 or so other people.
---
Unfortunately yes, I haven‚Äôt had it drop for me either (and I have the tadpole ‚Äútake the pylon 60 times‚Äù challenge completed )
---
It's not cost, it's the ability to travel due to weight. :p
---
Would love the consensus, or even evidence on this.
---
Putting a rubberband over one of the joysticks to make the console think you're still active. The camera, or your character just spins
---
Guess people dont want easy xp. Or too many of those guys that run out and kill everything without letting others get a shot in. I give every enemy a short burst of the 50 cal and let everyone get a shot in for the kills.
---
Is it possible to tell someone's in the lobby if you're not on a team with them? I'd join anyone who's in there, because even with two people there's at least a chance we can finish with a good time. Alone I'm lucky to hit level 2 and waste way too much ammo and stimpaks.
---
I never said it effected the game's stability. I only said what I said; mainly it effects my ability to enjoy my CAMP fully and serves virtually no function in game. Unneeded and unused, I never said anything close to it being an impact on performance or the like. 
---
Projecting statements I never made to win an argument you won't discuss in earnest to prove a point that really boils down to one's opinion. It's fine to have differing opinions but declaring one person's opinion wrong and then blocking them is pretty childish and defeats the idea of community engagement and discussion.   
---
To top it off, you accuse me of knowing nothing about game development even though my brother is a game dev and has been since the 90s. You also for no reason call me selfish. I know the whole world is stressed right now and I am not sure if you'll even see this response since you blocked me (or at least said you did) but it seems almost like your trolling but I don't think you are, so if you're stressed, depressed or angry in general during these crazy times there's help out there. I know from experience, I reached out when I hit a low point and am so glad I did. Have a nice day.
---
Magazines.  Treasure maps. Ammo. Junk. Flux for sure. Some bobbles.
---
Ummm. You can tame a creature or animal and have it at your camp.  Check your charisma perk cards out.
---
It exists because it's reskinned scout armor. Scout armor was seemingly meant to be the enclave alternative to combat armor, but like all other enclave content it's unfinished and forgotten. Scout armor only has level 40 and 50 variants. So alas, thorn and solar armor have level 40 and 50 variants
---
but it's floating
---
Its just for 60 seconds. Pretty easy to knock out in one event if you bring a few stims
---
I saw one post that ffr was broken on it.  But who knows.  I don't have one to test.  I guess I can buy it and test it and let you know lol.
---
I remember trying for that, but stash space got to me. The only full set I had was exterminator's, and that's not even useful now that funky duds is a thing
---
And me a liberator.
---
I mean you do realize the "it just works" statement was made talking about how the camp system works in real time right?
---
Underrated comment if true
---
Daily OP isn't a good idea anyway. Enemies there give half xp.
---
Does that work on the map menu as well?
---
That's super unfortunate, having a perk where you don't get any of the functionality of the stat.
---
Pets would be awesome. Even if they don't attack.
---
I bought it in the atom store and it did not (and still doesn't) say "plans required". I've been going back and forth with support for weeks. They are useless and inept.
---
As someone who has used the gun once, It‚Äôs worth it but the penta-barrel isnt
---
most other console MMO's have a text chat, like ESO. Hell, fucking call of duty nowadays has text chat on console.
---
Yeah. I even tried to check the heavy weapon stand to see if it could go there, because you know, the assault rifle might not be a big gun mechanically, but it's a big gun physically. Unfortunately it doesn't go there either.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for a giant consistent PvP land like ESO has.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that could happen. Interesting. Thanks
---
Tri barrel is worth it, penta barrel isn't
---
Oh, thanks!
---
Lately not many people go to the event. I feel like im alone in the server
---
Ah, yeah they fixed that so now it requires plans like its supposed to. They should definetly put that in the description
---
I don't mind not having particular enhancements for the next gen consoles, I just hope the new consoles will run the game smoother.
---
On the One X, I'm lucky enough to not really experience too many bugs, but I just get terrible performance.  Highly frequent frame dips, 10 sec freezes opening the map, long loading times, I wouldn't put up with this shit in any other game but I adore Fallout lol.
---
If the new consoles can automatically alleviate those performance issues I'll be a happy camper.
---
That is amazing and you are amazing.
---
On one hand it‚Äôs not the glitch where you drop it and pick it up, because it would be at the top. But then again, it‚Äôs modded, and legendaries don‚Äôt come modded.
---
Well, you would think that customer support would have figured that out by now.
---
Well the forest is still the best place I would think when it comes to safety.Unless you are near whitesprings or the fissure.The enemies cap at 50 although every now and then I have seen higher levels.
---
There are maps around that have all the fissure sites marked on them if you don‚Äôt know where they all are.So finding a spot far enough from them should not be a problem.Mothman and flatwoods monster spots are harder to lock down.They do not even have to be at  a random spawn location.There are just some areas they seem to be linked to.
---
Otherwise It is a bit of trial and error.
---
This'll do.
---
https://i.imgur.com/mwY4N0Y.png
---
Damn... that does look cool.
---
You have to be willing to take some constructive criticism man. No one is telling you to change your build, you do you. But if you want to talk objectively, a lot of people had good points that some things are redundant or not useful. Don't post your build if you can't take it. I was even trying to defend you saying you can do you but now you just sound like you think are above everyone. This is in response to your edit on your post.
---
Ohhhh I thought it was 60 times, I only did my tadpole grinding recently and I had done the event so many times that I saw that one completed I thought ‚Äúyep, sounds about right‚Äù üòÇ
---
The more treasurery notes the better... or rather less time I spend doing dailys the better
---
Some people are sitting on 10k+ atoms from a first subscription. Only costs 15000 to get to the very end, and you get 1500 atoms back along the way so really 13500. On top of that, many people have complained about the grind and feeling like they need to play every day when they have work/school/other real life needs. If somebody has enough disposable income where $130 is a single day's worth of work, they can essentially skip three months' worth of daily grinding with a few hours of real life grinding and enjoy all the rewards now. If that's enough to be worth their money, so be it
---
Yeah, everything I've read says penta barrel is terrible. Lowering the damage for increased fire rate just seems counterintuitive. You are literally just wasting extra ammo to deal about the same amount if damage at that point.
---
I'm looking at someones camp right now that has 1 raider and 2 bos collectrons.
---
I‚Äôm happy with all this information. Thank you
---
For me I use a combination of Party Boy/Girl Whisky, with Bufftats,then placing down any and all power armor frames.
---
would electric absorbtion allow me to take all 3 pylons without losing health?
---
I didn't even notice that edit. All I can say in response to his unfortunate legendary perk choices is keep on grindin I guess
---
Edit: get grindin.
---
Im not sure if thats classified as energy damage or not, I only tanked the sheepsquatch while others powered the pylons.
---
The lightning in the game is atrocious all around.  I played FO4 yesterday for the first time in a few months and I felt like a colorblind person after putting on those special sunglasses.
---
Cool. Thanks. I bought the mod a while back, but never really used it due to trying to trying to conserve 2mm ammo. Now I've got like 10k rounds and the means to craft thousands more at a time, so I figured I could risk it.
---
And yeah, I've heard penta is garbage.
---
Fix coming Tuesday
---
Cool !
---
Way better.  Less bugs, npcs, good quests, over all an immersive game.  Community is great and will help you through the first 50 levels
---
They mentioned a while ago they were working on something like that. Not sure when or if we'll actually see it, though. They even had pet emotes.
---
I like to hunt down low level player camps with random useless stuff that we all know wont sell, or with default pricing, just to give them a few more caps to work with now that we can't gift them our low level legendaries anymore.
---
How do you get enough steel?
---
I get more .45 rounds than I could ever use just playing the game and all the ultracite 5mm I need from daily ops so I set mine to produce 308 rounds which always sell even with daily ops being a thing now.
---
Thank you
---
That one floor tile with rotated wood paneling really bothers me though.
---
Yes
---
Very happy with the swing speed boost üòÇ
---
People doing this are most likely away from their computer for hours and don't want to get afk timed out. Being on the drums only keeps you from being kicked for half an hour.
---
Interesting. Could be that AA is bypassing your armor somehow. That would be a new change though I think. Sadly I don‚Äôt carry AA launcher since switching to TS after patch 9 but if I encounter any in the wild I‚Äôll absolutely try it out on myself and see what happens.
---
Well, To be fair, animal friend perk doesn‚Äôt explicitly state that, just says ‚ÄúChance to Pacify‚Äù but, yeah. 
---
If you level up ‚ÄúAnimal Friend‚Äù to level 3 and equip it, there‚Äôs quite a lot of different creatures you can tame and have guard your base.
---
If you already own the game why don‚Äôt you just start it up and try it out and form your own opinion rather than rely on the word of a stranger on the internet? 
---
Just FYI: I like the game now, but I also liked the game during beta and every time I played from then to now.
---
I have 2 ps4s, so I have plenty of ‚Äústash‚Äù ...my troubleshooters set is so sick for silo runs. The only one I can‚Äôt get finished is the ghoul slayers one, but I‚Äôm trying to be too specific with it. I want full trappers, with ghoul slayers and rad resist...it‚Äôs a white whale, so far I have a whopping one piece out of 5 :-/
---
I just put them in at base value if im not going to use them anyway, they fly off the vendor faster than I can put them.
---
That would be amazing. Maybe a neighboring state with constant war between the different factions
---
Better than my nocturnal one lol
---
no
---
I dont think many people have the stash space for that
---
The ability to sell them should be available, but only if both players have the plan!
---
Its been fixed lol hopefully make you feel better
---
so many people started this event and i have completed it many many times but today found out you need to complete the side quest for a chance of the fixer dropping. made me sad to be honest.

No mutations or class freak?

I have steel marked and literally grab every single thing I can with a magnifying glass. Pots and pans bring quite a bit, plus running through West-Tek and scrapping everything with the Scrapper perk can bring you several hundred steel easily. Those assault rifles give like 19 a piece, miniguns give 25. It takes 15 steel to make like 67 rounds of 2mm.
---
And if I'm really low, I'll go to a private server and take Graton Steel Mill and set up shop there while I farm my usual spots.

Good, I can now give you a proper upvote for it.

There's a 25% chance to get a possum badge from pioneer scout dailes. I just some a couple days ago. Im not sure about tadpole badges though since I only did the scout dailes once when I was doing the tadpole stuff

We can already tame creatures, just make it so they're essential like companions and it'll save people a lot of problems. I've replaced my deathclaw like 20x in the last month. Not because something killed it but because it just fell through the world or randomly died.

---
Wasnt all talk üòë
---
The worst is when they aren't even on it yet but just thinking of using it.
---
That, I don't know; I only know about this one workaround, unfortunately. :/
---
Hey if it makes you feel better, im just learning this too lol.
---
Okay.... and? One diluted radaway doesn't completely drain your water and hunger. It takes what, about 5 to 10% of your food and water. So yeah, unless your answer is; "I waste a survival syringe every time i take a radaway" then no, you havent answered my questions.
---
Not to mention almost all of my favourite outfits seem to have the under armor glitchiliy overlay ontop of it.
---
As long as you play the objective even if you‚Äôre dead half the time then you‚Äôll probably be making it easier. I think the exception is against the resilient bots since those things will just overwhelm the group.
---
I'll give ya one free but they got me working all weekend. Just dm me your gt and ill hit u up the next time I'm online
---
You would think power armor scorched exist
---
No one buys any ammo over 1c/round IMO. Atleast I know I don't. Everytime I lruce anything at 2c/round or higher it never moves. For crappy scrip guns/armor I usually do 100 and 75 caps/star respectively unless it has any decent effects. In which case it's anywhere from 300-5000/star if you get a really good roll.
---
Weapons that are usually easy to move:
---
**Weapons:**
---
* Bloodied
---
* Two Shot
---
* Explosive
---
* Junkie's
---
* Vampire's
---
* Faster Fire Rate
---
* Faster Reload
---
* 25% VATS
---
Armor:
---
* Bolstering
---
* Unyielding
---
* Vanguard's
---
* Sentinel's 
---
* Cavalier's
---
Usually they need to be mixed with other good effects. Look up the different effects and it will become somewhat obvious what is valued.
---
Base damage only ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø sorry about your perks/buffs though
---
I have been on the lookout for a good troubleshooter's set. Between the ISS, level 75 gutsies, and robot daily ops, its starting to seem like a very useful choice to carry around. If noting else, I'd like some of my thorn armor rolls to end up troubleshooter's
---
I've seen the event last under a minute because every spit and drum was filled.
---
I tried to step away from the spit to feed Chally a soon as the meter popped up, event ended before the animation of stopping was over
---
Theres no reason you could die there right ? I think i'ts too close to 76 to even be nuked.
---
Wow hahaha, also I had no idea tank killer worked with pistols! Thanks a bunch this will be super useful! Now I just gotta churn out like 20 levels for some conversions hahaha
---
Mine will drop a level 75-100 Super Mutant with between 5-15 shots, depending on weak point shots. One assault rifle from them nets me about 1 crafts worth of ammo, plus whatever extra steel I pick up from the environment, so I usually end up with a net gain. My last run through I used about 600-700 rounds of ammo. Got 400 steel from it, which I turned into ~2000 rounds of ammo.
---
I do keep Final Word on me and about 10k rounds of .50 cal just in case, but haven't had too many 2mm ammo issues since I maxed Ammo Factory.
---
Every under armor has mods!
---
SPOILER SPOILER 
---
they have a war with the blood eagles I believe.
---
Good luck!
---
I think they should have separated items like the ammo converter and chicken coop from the season and made them only obtainable through in-game gold bullion. I also think they should only add items to a season that can only be obtained during the season they 1st appear.
---
I can't fix it even with reshade :( If we could load an .esp I could edit all the instances of eye adaptation to be .1 and it would go away...
---
I don't care about the bond.
---
I'll leave the team if it looks like they're just hanging around, doing meat week or whatever and not actually trying to do the daily ops.
---
Thanks for doing all this, but yeah.
---
It seemed like such a huge task to find an entire new build, switch it all out, start trading for new weapons to fit the build and then decide what legendary perks to use that... I just quit the game :/
---
My previous build got hit so hard it felt like starting over
---
I agree, I was thinking that very same thing today.
---
Base or Pro PS4?
---
I have a weapons problem. I buy good weapons. It started with the challenges where you had to kill things with different weapons. I figured,  if I had to use a railway rifle, I should have a nice one. I found a BE Railway in a vendor and I was hooked. I started buying nicely rolled weapons,  even if they are weapons I'll never use. (Example: BSS+1STR Baton). I now have 3 mules and over 250 weapons. I don't have all the plans yet. If I can't find a decent weapon or anything else, and I want to burn caps I'll just buy more plans.
---
And every so often, I'll find a low level vendor and buy everything. That's fun, too, occasionally.
---
A magic armor piece, nice.
---
You *do* get functionality. Charisma affects more than just sharing perk cards.
---
This is the second time for me but the first time I managed to screenshot, really odd
---
where do you get that "most" people come from a sp background?  Like what actual verifiable stat or statement from Bethesda or source of any kind has there been to authoritatively prove this?
---
I meet players of all stripes in game.  a lot this is their first ever fallout game.
---
Maybe more people on reddit, on the official forums come from a sp background but in game I doubt that's the reality
---
The jump from 25 to 30 is noticeable, but I think the dps is better with explosive.
---
I have a junkies faster fire rate Gatling gun and I can definitely tell the difference. If you‚Äôre on ps4 you can join me and I‚Äôll shoot them both in front of you.
---
I thought they were the same to some extent, guess not.
---
It makes for some amazing silly fun! Mines a MIRV and it wrecks now
---
" I've replaced my deathclaw like 20x in the last month."
---
That's the main reason I ask, it's a chore doin it over and over
---
I have an executioners mirv since its the best ive gotten so far, love shooting it into piles of enemies
---
So far none of my bosses have stalled, but a few times in Valley Galleria my team has come close to a 8 minute round loss because a random mob would get stuck in the walls around this small cafe area upstairs where you repair the repeater.
---
Enemies scale, so no issue. My brother comes in with his level 13 with a pipe pistol so I can farm ammo.l for cheeeap.
---
No, he didn't mean lunchboxes, he meant perk card packs alright. The lunchboxes are already available and have been since Patch 22. They're adding buyable perk card packs for gold bullion as a way for players to get perk coins (or just perk cards) rather than having to run through leveling up.
---
You can tell a difference with ffr but do 10% damage or explosive.
---
It just doesn't feel like much ammo compared to the 2500 plasma cores I crafted recently.
---
Oh yeah. My character is an alcoholic because of the +6 STR bonus whiskey gives me
---
Ok
---
It‚Äôs so frustrating. Generally I‚Äôve been lucky but a few times people haven‚Äôt helped. Really aggravating when they‚Äôre using a place someone else could take.
---
Needs more salt.
---
I think it is a generational thing. I am old school: I would never use real money to buy those things, because I purchased the game and that was it. 
---
In the end, it is money and you decide how to spend it. Some people make fun at those of us who pay for videogames.
---
I can take some recordings next time I‚Äôm on. Both of my Harpoon and my dragon, depending on what you wanna see. I‚Äôll post them on my YouTube channel. I post misc testing clips but I don‚Äôt have a mic so I feel like only I understand what I‚Äôm trying to show lol
---
Nice, thanks for the info. One last question. I thought I heard something about magic damage only working in vats?
---
One wasteland has made the level up daily challenge trivial. The day patch 22 dropped I leveled up my lvl284 toon 5 times.  If you're finding it difficult to level up after patch 22 then you have to be doing something wrong.
---
The introduction of seasons has made gaining XP a must. I used to have 5 INT. With a mixture of food buffs, mutations and a full casual team I've managed to boost my INT up to 22.  The rate at which the repeatable XP score dings now is insane.
---
TLDR - One wasteland has made levelling up, even for high level players, a piece of piss.
---
If you know how to stand next to the gadget, you are good. I don't care about your level, just stay the fuck there. I'll revive you and kill everything.
---
It does as there is the option to side with the new "Warlords", a raider subfaction who have it out for the Brotherhood. Foundation also technically has its own form of "concerned settlers" regarding the BoS.
---
Can you not read or can you just not use your fucking head? Food gives you rada when you eat it. 2 melons when Im at 20% health takes my HP from ~58 down to maybe 50 health. Can you see how this isn't sustainable and cause for us to need to use radaways fairly frequently? What is it going to to take for you to understand this? Will this be the time or are you going to role play as an illiterate once again and claim the question wasn't answered? IT IS NOT RADAWAYS MAKING US HUNGRY/THIRSTY, IT IS THE FOOD CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR ALREADY SPARSE AMOUNT OF HEALTH. There you go, thick capital letters to smash the message through your thick skull.
---
Meat week isn't a great time to do it.  Hourly event most people hit plus the Primal Cuts plus the newness of Daily Ops and it can be tricky finding a time to fire it off.  I know I spend my "in-between" time just trying to fix armor and find ammo.
---
Also, it's a bitch now.  I've cleared it with a group after the rebalance but damn, it's not the same level of difficulty as it was previously and I would be hesitant to say it was a "gimme" event to begin with.  Those eyebots exploding will mess you up!
---
Fixer plan can be found in player vendors.  Expect to pay between 5-10k though.  It's not super duper rare, just uncommon.
---
Expeditions are more so a way to appeal to fans, such as a form of fan service. It will be sending us to small areas/snippits of areas from past Fallout games and other fan favorite areas. As to whether or not we'll get items from that region is to be seen.
---
Wait, did I miss all the rabid jealousy?  Where did it go?
---
I think this is a key point. It‚Äôs fine to join at any level but I wouldn‚Äôt join a team with only one player or other low(ish) level players. If you join a team with one or two very high level players then likely they‚Äôll be happy you‚Äôre helping boost the timer and they‚Äôll take care of the mobs reasonably easily on their own.
---
I simply don't think the raid was salvageable.  Its problems were fundamental ones.  The game lags too much to have down-to-the-wire timers.  The expectation that players would call out objectives, numbers, or the activation order of objects was too much, let alone that they'd rescramble it every time.  They said it themselves - people were not "engaging" with this event like they had wanted them to, so they shut it down and they gave ample warning that they were about to do this.
---
There could also have been technical reasons.  This was the first run of the instancing tech.  It obviously had some problems in the beginning with gobbling up inventory.  For all we know, this nascent approach was rendered incompatible with whatever they do now with instancing and it wasn't worth trying to port an already-unpopular quest over to it.
---
They assume constructive criticism is jealousy because of the use of redundant or not useful cards to the build.
---
Drums in photomode
---
It‚Äôs not bugged. I‚Äôm the same and just got my first two drops recently.
---
I always try to sell stuff for low prices and even have one of my vending machines with free stuff, which is usually ammo for starter weapons ans low level armour and some plans/recipes. It's just nicer. I sell a lot of food items at 1 or 2 caps too because I'm a terrible hoarder and pick up everything I see that I think might be useful then end up with 50 yum yum devilled eggs in my inventory that I will probably never actually use because I tend to only eat soup since it fills both hunger and thirst.
---
Wait wait wait, what are you talking about? I haven‚Äôt seen these events. I‚Äôve seen the primal events, but I don‚Äôt know what to do with the meat or where this happens.
---
Seriously?
---
Why post then build then?  Just to brag and show off?
---
ü§£
---
People post builds here for advice. 
---
So, weird flex, but okay.
---
And I just noticed his screen name. 
---
That‚Äôs just sad.
---
and hopefully it isn't exclusive to the Atom Shop
---
It is, leave your groceries at home and just bring your lunch and snacks. üòâ
---
Have you learned all power armor mods? Good cap sink after the serums. By the way, I don't craft serums and I don't wear power armor (my DR is over 700 and power armor would be a downgrade in every way) but knowledge is power.
---
Iirc only purveyor drops fixers so if you are waiting for a world drop that would explain it.
---
That is exactly what I said. I was defending them before they posted that edit. Now they deserve whats coming to them for thinking that they have the god build or something. Everyone can have what they want but don't assume everyone is jealous because they have things they would change.
---
Exactly. Between the chip on his shoulder and the immature name, I‚Äôm guessing... 14. 
---
Mental age, regardless of the surrounding meat sack. 
---
And now he has another edit trying to backpedal, lol.
---
Yeah in the moderator post at the top of the reddit they say that enemies killed in daily ops will drop ammo based on which weapons you use against them.
---
How about leeches stop getting mad for being called out as leeches?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to tell. It would be great if it was visible in the social menu when looking at groups...
---
But I don't wanna
---
RIP
---
I guess most people don‚Äôt know this. It‚Äôs an obscure location but easy to get pies from there. It‚Äôs not a rare item IMO.
---
Alright im gonna ask. Do you care about min max or just trying to have fun?
---
Thats false. My friend has got them as rewards for events.
---
His second edit makes no sense because thats basically what he is doing in the first edit by saying we will all reach his level some day. Thats hilarious.
---
I would rather a new guy that tries opposed to the high levels I been playing with lol
---
And I‚Äôve only had two fixer drops since they came out
---
Over a year an not a single one its pretty nuts..
---
Angry Turtle did a comprehensive review of the mods if you‚Äôve got some time: (spoiler, tri barrel wins)
---
https://youtu.be/hG_ZFwKaPiI
---
I literally got downvoted because I don't have any friends and don't know that.
---
It probably isn't, but I wasn't really comparing guns. The gun tears shit up (and I still need to finish maxing a few damage perks I want), has a huge magazine size, super fast reload, its fun to use and I can craft enough ammo now to use it regularly. That's all that matters to me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Okay
---
yeah i saw someone sell it for 9k, man did i get excited as fuck and realised i only had 4k caps lmao. currently saving now and have yet to find another
---
Wouldn't be too far-fetched, Berhesda promoted a Fallout 4 mod on the Creation Club in which you visit the Galaxy News Radio plaza. Considering how much Bethesda uses mods as inspiration for future content and features, it wouldn't surprise me at all to see the Capital Wasteland make a comeback
---
What game console are you on, I might be able to help with the mask. I'm on PS4
---
My point is maybe not everyone is purposely leeching lol. If the slots were filled when they were there then they went afk, they wouldn‚Äôt be there to hop on a instrument if a slot opens
---
Outer Worlds was great just a lot shorter than what people expected.
---
I think silo runs need a total overhaul. It‚Äôs too long now. It was fun when doing it for the first time but now it‚Äôs a tedious grind and just adds too much time to the SBQ or Earl fights.
---
I know how to afk on the drums, but how do you do so on the spit, you can‚Äôt really move, or put a rubber band in place like you can with the drums.
---
I'd like to know why they want to do it.
---
If it's because they feel this is too much of a burden, or too confusing, for new players, I think the more practical approach would be to do this like Pacifist Mode - players needn't both with eating or drinking until Lv. 5 or so.  Focus on understanding the basic mechanics, and then add this minor level of complexity.
---
And some seasonal events. I got a Fixer from Faschnat.
---
It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to solo, and good luck even attempting to keep all 3 animals alive.
---
No offense but why would you need to upgrade it/max it out? I usually always have 4/5 on hand at rank one, I have speed demon which drains my hunger and thirst and yet I'm usually never starving or thirsty enough to use more than one syringe every hour(which is lucky because using stuff like soup usually constantly needs to be used and replenished). Really the only extra benefits of maxing it out is having a cure/heal all that cleans out every single disease and heals you to max health.
---
You can prime it while still having a faster fire rate.
---
How rare is sentinels/cavaliers? Do they only get that name if certain effects are all present? I just got a cavalier marine leg the other day and I‚Äôve never seen that name before
---
Ok, so maybe it's events and mumbles but if regular legendary enemies won't drop them it's a much lower chance overall compared to every other weapon that's not restricted like this. 
---
Iirc sone events literally use the purveyor "mystery pick" pool which includes all items you have plans for like bear arm, fixer etc.
---
Ofc i could be wrong or my info might be out of date.
---
I didn't mean to compare them either, but steel just sucks to farm, it's a lot harder to.
---
Over max caps even 3 legacy but definitely 1
---
Yeah, this guy is good for a laugh, at least. 
---
Gaining XP in this game is just a matter of ‚Äòhow much time do I want to spend grinding‚Äô and ‚Äòhow many Int/XP buffs do I want to keep active‚Äô. 
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a stunning achievement. It‚Äôs just time spent.  
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äòget on the same level‚Äô.  Easily 90%+ of this player base could be at the same XP point if they chose to invest the same amount of time.
---
Try everything. The cat astronaut into a newsstand or oven. Cooking station into a chem station to save room as they both work. My one camp is dozens of merged items. Love the reactions from random visitors. Have fun.
---
Do you play full or low health?
---
Keep the following in mind-
---
You still receive bonuses for keeping your food and water bars maxed.
---
Survival shortcut heals you like a super stimpack and cures your diseases.
---
The negatives are being toned down, but if you aren't letting your hunger/thirst deplete into the red, this will not affect you. It just allows for lazy builds that never eat or drink and save carry weight in the process. You still receive the benefits of tending to your needs.
---
Just having fun mostly. I'll probably continue playing at endgame but I'm not going to mix max so much.
---
I wouldn't put it past them that most of that exp could have been exploited. We all know the early days were a shitshow. I remember a few weeks after it came out, one glowing ghoul gave 800-1000 exp. And of course there was the grenade exploit as well.
---
Why would they add survival shortcut just to remove it?
---
Just joined this branch of reddit. Fucking crazy and I feel right at home batching and moaning about this fucking broken game that I keep playing on the daily but due to playing with 3 other friends that are more experienced im still learning how the game works at level 32.
---
Tesla master race
---
It's supposed to come with the Brotherhood.
---
This.
---
A mix now that One Wasteland is out, I don't have to play bloodied nearly as often to do damage, but I'm currently low health right now(and have been for the last week) specifically for the carry weight bonuses.
---
I think fixers have only been able to drop from events since this year‚Äôs fasnacht. Before that, you could only get them from the purveyor (which made them more rare). 
---
If I had the time I could probably link the patch notes from when they made it so the fixer could drop from world events, but alas...
---
Absolutely. But if we even suggest that, then we‚Äôll be ‚Äòjealous scrubs‚Äô. üôÑ
---
Yes, I am highly Jealous I can't run rad resistant on a PA build.
---
There are some that for some reason the second star is the name (Safecrackers, Acrobat, Poisoners, etc). That Cavaliers Marine leg still has a primary effect, it's just not in the title. I have no idea why. But Sentinels is more popular than Cavaliers.
---
Yes it would be helpful to know if this is just dumbing things down to try and gain new players or if there is some grande plan in the future for which this is the first step, if it‚Äôs the latter I admit I can‚Äôt think what that could be...if it‚Äôs the former then I agree w/ you...I‚Äôd like to be able to opt-in to a more survival-ish gameplay
---
*git gud scrub*
---
Booo I wanted to run around with my Pip Boy light mod that the mining helmet has
---
So basically you want to circumvent not being able to FT due to being overweight.  Think it's time you try the inventory management simulation the rest of us are playing.
---
I too am the guy who camps the grill at gatherings to make sure the meat isnt overcooked
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you ask an excellent question
---
Oh gotcha, thanks
---
I play on 20% health and survival syringes stop me having to micromanage my rads every 20 minutes because eating 6 melons cuts me dow to like 10% health. Max Survival Shortcut is a popular card for bloodied players because it allows you to use the syringes in lue of food.
---
Okay yeah I can totally see that, but I do not want to target grenades and such unless i have a perk card for it.
---
For one, it's a multi step event in a confusing environment. For another, the odds of success are slim unless you're very lucky with the people who show up. 
---
I'm aware that some people can solo this, but my general guideline is this: if I fail three times in a row, I'm not doing it again.
---
Just to your camp, in the same way you can do it for vault 76, not for everywhere.
---
Do you have a trading mule too?
---
In fallout 3 there was a ghoul mask item that if worn, feral ghouls wouldn‚Äôt attack you. Would love to get that in this game.
---
I agree 100%. I‚Äôm fine with fighting enemies to launch the nuke but having to go through all the steps (unless you just glitch it) is way too much of a process for the everyday player to do with any consistency
---
So you are complaining you played the game, and by playing the game you leveled up? And this is a ‚Äòwaste‚Äô because they won‚Äôt count for future challenges?
---
Dude, you are really reaching for a reason to be upset,but the only reason I can find is you dumb.
---
For shotguns it only works in VATS. If you are abusing the fire rate based glitch with heavy weapons, that works out of VATS
---
Feh, I forgot half your post, thanks app. 
---
Imo you probably don‚Äôt want to be using level 35 items at level 70.  I suspect even crafted weapons will be out-damaging it, even in the executioner‚Äôs band.
---
My underground camp remains unbothered since it‚Äôs never damaged üëÄ
---
I dont let my bars go low, I always have my rejuvenated bonuses up, but I replaced food with syringes because food gives me rads and when your low health every little tick of rads is actually quite punishing, but if theyre taking away the downsides of food, which you can only assume means rads and disease, then melons would just do the exact same as the syringes for me.
---
Well you can find the clean ski outfit plan in the game.I have no idea if it was ever a atom item.
---
Lol, makes sense. You can tell I never afk, thanks for the tip.
---
Some of that could be server issues. If the server doesn't respond in time your character can lag a lot.  
---
Honestly just some higher resolution textures and maybe trim down the game size by removing duplicate textures and such for the SSD. All they really have to do.
---
Or more likely they are just dicks.
---
Depends on the buyer. It‚Äôs not a limited time item or a super-rare drop either. 
---
It will get cheaper and cheaper over time. If you‚Äôre selling, do it soon. If you‚Äôre buying, wait and be patient.
---
You can just easily look it up...Bunch of posts asking for this setup but don‚Äôt search...
---
Are you on XBox?
---
I think you're talking about Long Shot. Crack Shot definitely has a pistol on it and is for pistols.
---
It should work for Commando as long as you ADS.
---
It took me a long time a long time and finally it happened I bought one from mumbles and it‚Äôs a medics with exploding bullets I forget the last star right now
---
But you can‚Äôt sell from it, which is what op said. Not that they want an already existing box,but to sell from it instead of just the stash.
---
But you can‚Äôt sell from it.
---
the heart wants what the heart wants
---
and the heart wants to crit snipe some radtoad mines
---
&gt;Has anyone managed to get a top tier award on any of these OP events solo ?
---
I've gotten elder while solo on most of them so far. Resilient bots can suck my radiated nuts, but the rest aren't too bad if you know the maps.
---
Not at all just had a level 18 with us. They did awesome and followed us around no problem!
---
Also why do the forceful/precise stocks that give a slight increase in bash damage giver more durability than the bruising stock, which only adds bash damage?
---
Omgosh thank you for this. I was late going to the event earlier and it had just started and it was over before I got there. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how the heck.... Lol
---
gotcha. I just didn't know if it would be worth the caps to upgrade a regular level 50 when at any point I could get a great legendary.
---
ps4
---
Smoked mirelurk is where it‚Äôs at. +75 carry weight for 1.5 hours. An hour and a half! The only other food that good is pepperoni rolls. 
---
Edit: spelling
---
It's Bethesda it never makes sense
---
Your friend can travel there and then you can ft to your friend but yeah, I agree that would be a nice qol feature.
---
Darn. I usually run 5 - 6 solo Encryptid a day on Xbox
---
I have 3 mules and 2 mains.  The mains are very rarely overweight. My mules however are permanently overweight but they don't have a base they would be able to FT to.  The mules do trade from time to time but a quick message to the other party generally results in them traveling to me.
---
The purpose of a downvote is to get rid of misinformation. While I didn't downvote you its likely not personal from the people that did.
---
Well I got one last night for 400 caps. Seemed like a good deal to me. 
---
And surprisingly another buyer was selling the Chally mask and suit for 100 caps each, so heck, threw money at them as well!
---
have you gotten the fixer from it?
---
"I know Brussels sprouts are unpopular, but that's because you haven't had MY Brussels sprouts!"
---
I ordered a pizza. Get that greenish shit away from me.
---
Don't like trading other things though due to getting scammed but iknow what you mean, thanks
---
Just got 22k for it like so I'm pretty happy
---
OMG like a literal physical rubber band haha that's classic
---
Sorry as a PC player I forget this is also on console.
---
The weapon? The original one from the quest line.
---
Smoked mirelurk. +75 carry weight and underwater breathing for an hour and a half. Also stacks with deathclaw steak and strange in numbers if  mutated and on a team. You‚Äôll carry almost as much as a calibrated Excavator. With all those I get 470 carry weight.
---
That‚Äôs a sweet deal!  Congrats!
---
Looks like you just saved atheist 21600 caps haha Someone just bought it off me for 22k like so I'm.not complaining haha,
---
I merged _real, working_ sink into the L-shaped chem station. very cool!
---
Smoked mirelurk does +75 for me.
---
The paddle ball has some, unfortunately they were stolen from the devroom and pached out.
---
Thanks dude
---
This game already overwhelmingly favors low health builds with the perks and mutations that synergize. This seems like a silly complaint. 20/25% doesn't make much of a difference to low health builds either.
---
They‚Äôre not removing it, they‚Äôre just removing the debuffs. You‚Äôll still get buffs for being well fed/full on thirst, you just won‚Äôt lose any ap if you don‚Äôt eat or drink, so the perk cards are still relevant
---
Believe me, I would love to try all the mods.
---
If only I could play on PC.
---
Yeah, I want  Pet liberator named Mart-E

Yup, the machine, the npc, and Meg are the largest issues there.
---
Aren‚Äôt there already several raider pa skins? Bone, scanner, raider dlc?
---
I've had this happen as well... If I can get  the noob to go into trade I can then hook them up proper, especially if they have a mic. I also try to get them to my camp so I can manufacture some quality gear, but a lot of them are skittish, afraid it'll be a death trap or something.
---
Literally just trades my plan for 1000 flux (800 violet 200 cobalt). So like that guy said: Priceless and worthless
---
They're probably just making up for lost Xp/loot from all the times the server crashed during past events.  I had 2 maybe 3 server crashes during meat week event and another during SBQ today.

Oh right, better prices. But what I'm saying is that ANY other legendary stat perk would give you full functionality. Edit. Then as op would say, you can just shuffle points around into charisma.
---
With this perk you just have 5 extra not true charisma points.
---
The hardest part of ops is getting more than two people that will join, and then sit on the point. Even the roughest (resilient bots) settings are pretty straightforward as long as you have 4 people on the point, and then everyone focusing the boss. If all you do is sit on a point, you'll basically just be buying your team more time for the boss.
---
Real common.
---
They can find another fucking server then
---
Calibrated shocks and motion assist servos. Good luck getting the shocks plan.
---
I understand how this can be annoying when there aren't that many players attending the event, but now that we can basically fill the bar before the event starts, it's really easy to stop caring. 
---
Half the time I'm about a minute and a half late to it and miss the rewards entirely! It's basically completed before the timer starts officially. So for me, it's not worth the stress of sprinting around when 9.9/10 times anything I contribute means nothing.
---
I really wish Beth. would fix that so it was an actual event again, but as it is now I feel so much less inclined to do anything.
---
This is the one gun in the game that I actually prefer limb damage.
---
20 base firerate, +5 for speedy receiver and +5 for the firerate legendary effect. They do stack but if you want DPS you‚Äôre probably better off priming it, saves you ammo and you get more queen damage
---
Coming to the atom shop soon*
---
Honestly if there's no penalty, I'm never eating or drinking again.
---
Got one from the Meat Cook two days ago.
---
You can just spam spacebar to cook things fast.  I don't see what the issue is really.
---
A team makes it quicker because the enemy amount doesn't scale. Four folks makes for four targets to absorb shots, four guns to do damage, and three people to stim you if you drop (which often is done, because the mobs drop so many stims it's silly).
---
I do manage to solo, but I do it by face tanking during the "stand by the big open area with five directions to watch" parts with a Vamp Gatling Gun and Power Armor, and nuking the boss with a Junkies Fire Rate Minigun (burning all that juicy ammo I just got by shooting mobs with the slow fire gatling gun). 
---
The big thing is, you have to both be able to face tank some damage *and* kill fast enough to not get overwhelmed by spawns, which means only a few builds can really pull off a solo run for the harder combos. Group runs are much easier because it splits the load, and if you're lucky, you'll be paired with someone like me, who can solo but decides not to because it's more fun in a group.
---
Helps with speech checks. Increases event XP. 
---
Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt affect perk sharing but that‚Äôs probably because it would be too easily exploitable.
---
Taking a different LP and just moving the raw points into Charisma is the better option, absolutely.
---
how do i get mods for it ?i didnt see Regs sell them.
---
Out in the mire there‚Äôs a wrecked shack with some crops and an unnamed settler, it‚Äôs a really nice camp spot and there‚Äôs a cool bunker that‚Äôs extremely hard to build in but with enough time you could probably make it work. There‚Äôs also a raider NPC in Charleston in a shack but I‚Äôm pretty sure you won‚Äôt be able to place a camp there
---
Use the new legendary special perks to squeeze thru hiker and traveling pharmacy into your build.
---
You need the ultracite calibrated shock plans. Mod adds 50lb carry weight per leg
---
Same, unless I see something laying on a shelf and can just eat right away by holding the button my character will just go hungry
---
Okay, thank you very much!
---
Can we for the love of god fix the rubber-banding health issues so before we call it stable....PLEASE
---
I've got a Responders-themed camp in the Ash hlHeap that has a vendor with free items most level 50s and up should already have plenty of &amp; plans they already know. New players generally only take what they need; higher levels will usually empty the machine. Bloody raiders...
---
I mean, I'll probably still use xp boosting food, but that's probably it.
---
Explo/ffr Junkie and bloody same as every other weapon. But on a simi auto anti armor and two shot are viable choices
---
Typo, I meant to say there was a cool bunker
---
It takes Ultracite mods that you get from the SBQ. Since SH is character locked no one can do it for you and that mod is exceedingly rare.
---
I guess I've been very lucky, every "random Spec Ops team I've join they've all participated and came in as soon as I started it. Better yet there has only been one time that we didn't get Elder on the first try...that was the nasty resilient bots in the borrows. That one seriously sucked!
---
I got so very close, had about a minute left and then the "boss" spawned on the other side of the map, legit had to run 30 seconds to get to him and finished 8 seconds over time -\_-
---
noice!
---
Is this PA worth getting or best to stick to the loader?
---
How can you say so much and still not answer the question? You still haven't proved that max rank is better then 1 star. I think you've lost track of what you were talking about. Anyways have a good one
---
Oh, you‚Äôre here to bitch that things can hurt you and you don‚Äôt 1 shot everything. Got it.
---
Well bloody builds combined with armor,mods and backpacks tend to spoil you.Though I have noticed that players tend to carry way more stuff than they possibly need and stow way more than they need as well.Stash access is so numerous in this game it really isn‚Äôt necessary and most tend to hoard.
---
How hard can it be?  Just set Slider = true in the #cooking subroutine and hit compile! 
---
Bethesda, if you are reading this, put me in charge and I'll have this shaped up in a week!
---
In next Tuesday's hotfix they said they would lower the difficulty a bit for middle level players. Other than that, at your level I recommend you think about builds and mutations. The weapons are capped at level 50, so you won't get much stronger weapons than you probably have at the moment, however having the right perks and mutations make a big difference.
---
If you are Bloodied, I can give you a 1* Bloodied .50 cal (max level which is 45 for this gun). I ran this for a while but found a better version so you can have this for free.
---
Honestly i thought the same thing with my 65, and I guess you just don‚Äôt realize how much damage this thing can tank. Hence why i love being a PA user.
---
Which one do you use? My BE flamer tends to just one-shot the mobs there being not that much of a help for the teammates.
---
I should clarify I'm not a junky or bloodied build. But thank you! What about mods wise?
---
whaaaat
---
cheers i just checked i have most of them unlocked
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 so far from daily ops too.
---
I would be very upset. I really like the idee of it not impacting gameplay if you dont want it too. For people who do want it, they can have it. But I could live without.
---
Yeah no lol
---
Yes, from the 50 limb dmg
---
If you mean Bloodied, +50% Limb Damage, 25% less Vats cost.. Yes.
---
the plan
---
No, but that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt usually make up stories.
---
It's on normally.  Do you mean turn it off?
---
i‚Äôm on Pro and experience these frequently. 
---
I took a break after beating Wastelanders and came back the other day and the game seems even more sluggish whether it be pop in or menus.
---
I‚Äôm a heavy weps user an was def worth it the return on ultracite ammo is pretty nuts  I wouldn‚Äôt of even thought to prime my weps before this
---
Make sure your CAMP module is on the ground or a low to the ground flat surface.  If they fall from most any height when they rez in they will die. If your camp module is on the second floor...yer pets a gonner. The module is their home base from which to roam. (You may already know this but other might not :D )
---
At least the ammo converter is a lot better than before after update. Adding the ability to do bulk ammo instead of a measly 10 per is a lot more time efficient and tidy in the menu. Cash in points for ammo bulk, buy some bulk amounts bam
---
It's annoying as hell and adds visual clutter. At least give us a way to fill it's hp and make it disappear.
---
If your module is placed in an alright location, you won't have to. Keep it on the ground or VERY close to it.
---
In my opinion you're leaving propellant in the rocket if you don't use pa with a heavy weapon.
---
You can! I believe in you.
---
I'm not sure what the correct answer is, but as food for thought:
---
If you don't use heavy armor you'll want an anti armor weapon for sure.
---
If your do want power armor you would be able to get stabilized, what rads would give you rad regen so you'd probably never worry about radiation, you wouldn't have to roll for legendary armor, and you could get the perk where energy attacks recharge your core. 
---
If you use a gatling laser as your heavy weapon power user and batteries included double dip for fusion cores for both weapons and armor.
---
Only limited to what plans you have. [here‚Äôs ](https://i.imgur.com/T3opw6j.jpg)an older pic of the couches and wood stove.
---
Yeah, I have it backwards I guess.
---
Thirst and hunger drive down your health below the trigger point for those, I forgot once and woke up to 0 stims, whereas I had 100+ the night before.
---
I wouldn't say that's *the* inspiration, but very cool picture.
---
Unless you are certain you tube people who believe you can run an op for lowest rank have a chance then paladin and have 2 chances and then elder for 3 more chances.So a total of 6 chances.
---
True, but wouldn‚Äôt their time be better served by finally squashing several of the bugs we‚Äôve had for months in some cases or over a year in others?  Devs only have so much time to work is all I‚Äôm saying
---
I agree with you OP, maybe they are pondering the meaning of life or trying to understand the logic behind game grinds....
---
This is important stuff, their philosophy may one day lead to improvement in people's lives...
---
As a person who lives on berry mentats because of seasonal xp grind, I must say they're totally broken since last patch. Not only I haven't *ever* seen berry shader triggered on camouflaged enemies, the shader (when it works) seem to disappear entirely after couple minutes and stops showing up even on visible enemies.
---
Just think how much more CAMP budget we could have if they weren't wasting server space tracking the health of every item...
---
Give it a health count when attacked, reset to full if not destroyed and combat times out.
---
Either way's fine with me... I got so used to the FO4 survival dynamics that I barely even think about it as it is. 76 is way less rigorous--took me a long time to get used  to freely spamming stimpaks and RadAway with no side effects, for one.
---
As mentioned, it‚Äôs going to lose value over time. But there are people who will pay handsomely for the full set right now.  Just depends on the buyer and if they want to grind daily ops or not.
---
Great job. I've wanted to do a modern camp for a whole,  but this is much better that I was envisioning. Noice!!
---
I think the graphics are pretty good enough I just really want a better frame rate on consoles. I feel like it is always under 30 fps outside (ps4 pro)
---
My dad gives me a monthly allowance of $10k because I earn it by getting good grades and because he‚Äôs better than my mom.
---
I earn my money like every one else - through hard work and all on my own. So I‚Äôm entitled to spend it however I want. It‚Äôs my money and you‚Äôre just another lazy person who doesn‚Äôt work hard enough. Because if you did, your dad would give you a small loan of $1million too.
---
I am also a heavy weapons user, and shotguns.
---
Says the guy that took the time to write that rant
---
So the explosive does plus 20 base damage?
---
No yea I think so
---
Hardened is the best simi auto receiver if you don‚Äôt use ultracite ammo, If you do use ultra ammo use the prime receiver. Stinging mag is the best magazine, red dot sight is my preferred scope. Everything else is build preference. Also junkies is pretty good, 50% more damage for minor stat debufs. You barely notice the negative effects and you don‚Äôt really need to make a build for junkies, just get addicted.
---
Same, BE. I only have the heavy gunner perks at level 2 and no demo expert but I don‚Äôt get anywhere close to one shorting.
---
Edit: Just realized I use it mostly when I go full health PA for daily ops.
---
Um, what? No, they're not bothering with anything and just taking rewards from everyone else's efforts.
---
Hey if it‚Äôs any consolation, strength scaling hasn‚Äôt changed. To the best of my knowledge it‚Äôs still +5% per Strength point up to 15 and +2.5% for each point after that. So you can still make use of party boy, whiskey, and unyielding armor. Unfortunately all the food and chem buffs got neutered.
---
Though if it‚Äôs not too late, I‚Äôd say try to invest in some armor penetration gear. A puncturing power fist, martial artist, etc. (if you haven‚Äôt already). Armor penetration matters so much more now and it could help make things more manageable. 
---
I‚Äôd argue that even something like a spiked boxing glove could be useful solely due to the armor pen, despite it offering some of the lowest base damage in class. Everything‚Äôs a tank now so the more armor you can bypass the better. I‚Äôve seen good results since switching up some of my gear to armor pen mods/prefixes.
---
Its not a priority but the system is just so tedious. It adds nothing to the game. I like the cooking and perks of that but the mandatory eating/drinking. Im sick of  You lose ap, you cant travel. Its a break in your fun. Esp when you eat like 9 meals a day.
---
Campfire tales ' and the stings and things daily and operation tidy daily can all reward badges
---
Yea, I kinda miss hardcore survival from Fo4...and Wild Wasteland from NV while I‚Äôm going all nostalgic ü§™
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what you ‚Äúthink‚Äù, people don‚Äôt do that. Anywhere and anymore if it ever happened. At its best, 1:1 for legacy the day it came out.
---
Those go for 5k nowadays.
---
Beautiful. Would you like to build a real home?
---
Good weapon for those robot melee only ops
---
Because my typing three sentences is somehow related to anything I said?
---
Shit, your reading comprehension isn‚Äôt very good either is it?
---
I'm full-health Vanguard stealth commando and I'm a huge fan of AA. The handmade I have right now is 250 DR on reload and 33% VATS, but I'd love a faster fire rate version.
---
If youre playing just for fun then do you.
---
As long as you help with the first two beacons, you should be fine to help the higher level players. Then let them do their damage with the final enemies. 
---
You don‚Äôt even have to kill anyone on the first two beacons. Just keep stimming while you hover around the beacon.
---
If you actually field test them, they're pretty much all the same.
---
The game is in one of the best states it has been in for a long time. With the recent acquisition by Microsoft and the amount of money and resources they have access to, I think we will see patches and fixes on a much larger scale to this game. This isn't Zenimax anymore, this is Microsoft and I am sure they don't want the fallout 76 blemish on their name any longer than they have to.
---
Yeah his username is literally telling people to get good and then he posts this mess.
---
Yes, it does.  A massive difference.
---
Thanks I needed a good laugh.
---
I can't wait to yeet 90% of my food.
---
I haven‚Äôt had this issue personally but I‚Äôll upvote!  Happy cake day. : )
---
I‚Äôve gotten dozens
---
I have like 14 of them right now
---
Ah nice!
---
fyi, those pieces don't stop rain.
---
Wow nice
---
I do drums but not afk. I wish we could emote during it
---
Oddly enough she was the first non quest ally I found on each of my toons just by doing normal everyday stuff in the game.Never use her though as she is an annoying hippie chick.
---
I‚Äôd be interested to know how the opinions break down as far as length of gameplay...I‚Äôve been a devotee since beta, maybe that‚Äôs why it seems like misallocated time to me but I‚Äôd guess newer players are more in favor...for myself I don‚Äôt even think about eating/drinking; so used to taking 5 seconds to harvest my water and maybe 30 to kill and cook whatever‚Äôs right outside my camp that doing it is just routine, but then I actually miss losing my addictions w/ death, added a bit of realism
---
But why did you kill kawaii level 10? üòø
---
Do we really need this stickied for 4 days straight?
---
Try running a Daily Op with a low level? I‚Äôm on PS4, or I‚Äôd be down.
---
Very nice :)
---
Ohh this annoys me extremely it's an eye sore to say the least.
---
Like what I find most annoying is that when you repair an item it doesn't complete the hole bar, So most of my item health is just a smiggin from destruction so than what was the point of repairing if it goes poof from the next bit of damage.
---
This is also greatly annoying when I have enemies out of range taking pot shots which ever so often one of my structures go poof.
---
The event is easily doable with three strong characters, so a fourth is just an additional speed boost. If you can keep yourself alive for the most part, move when everyone else moves, and participate, then no worries. If you're one of only three, you might have more sweat to add in, but the event probably needs a couple tough higher levels to work.
---
tl: It depends on the mix of other players. If it already seems strong, a brave lower level player has value.
---
I LOVE that optimism, I‚Äôm hoping for the same but remember it‚Äôs still Beth doing the work...just a different suga-momma now lol
---
It worked thank you, as long as I keep a single regular core on me it seems to work like normal
---
No. It doesn't. Nerd rage is all you're missing. The damage and survivability difference is almost non-existent after last patch. I hardly notice a damage difference between my vampire and bloody 50 cal anymore. Absolute max damage is no longer important.
---
Ps changing it back and forth does NOT solve this issue for future reference üòÇ lot of wasted fluxes
---
You're probably not gonna be able to do a full on sniper but I have sniper tendencies
---
Nothing is changing except removing the negatives. It‚Äôs not a new system. It‚Äôs the same season with low values deleted. Ohhh, how difficult for professionals.
---
I am fine keeping it, but playing up the work load is dishonest.
---
Definitely, especially the ones requiring a melee hit to finish off
---
There's a new misc item in the files for the treehouse village. (Treehouse village supplies), so we'll probably have to help them out.
---

The items that were added. There's also plans for the Pulowski Preservation shelter and a bubble turret.
---
You can see it here it shows the 10mm skin and the combat shotgun skin
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Free_States_paint
---
I don‚Äôt mind it, I am super used to it as it is not the only game with this mechanic and with the abundance of food in the wasteland + the inclusion of the symptomatic allowing you eat raw food I don‚Äôt see the point of removing (and this is coming from a speed demon mutie with no perk cards in food or drink)
---
What's killing me, is I either get nothing or cage light plans. While these other people in here get 3 dam rewards in one run.
---
I think I have thos plan in my vendor if you are on pc
---
Yup those are the ones I mean, I had to rearrange my whole build to do that one in good time
---
Oh, I see. I only use 1* heavy gunner perks because of diminishing returns and because of how powerful the gun is. I only run at below 20%hp also because of the xp grind, I just hate missing out on lots of additional xp.
---
I want Steelheart in my camp! Or Rover.
---
I have just one saved, the rest i eat them ü§∑üèº
---
Mine were all some random player name. Everything I pick was ghunter57. Then at my camp mole miners? Mutant? Scorched? Everything hostile was mole rat broodmother.
---
This is why I have a second bench when I have AI's in my camp &amp; it's always the tinckers workbench for me.
---
Ugh why can we not have automatic rights over these bloody AI's.
---
I realize it's not an easy task, but a cross-save via xbox play anywhere would be amazing. My laptop is good, but not great. I plan on getting a series X and would love to be able to play on that at home and my PC is someone is using the TV or I'm away from home.
---
Nice.
---
&gt; Won't be this "massive" one-drop DLC like Wastelanders, content will be spread out through updates like Wild Appalachia. 
---
Why can't they just be honest and say Steel dawn is pushed to winter and Fractured Steel is pushed to spring 2021?
---
Its definitely a tougher one! If you have a couple of people to do it with its a good idea to organise someone as a 'melee runner' to just melee all of the low health ones and have the rest firing regularly. Helped my group a bit :)
---
[Excuse me, whaaaaaaat?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVZ2vk3PYPE)
---
Legs take the most damage out of any other part.Traps,shorter enemies and jumping while getting fired at all add to it.
---
Been complaining about this since launch. I really hope they do something
---
I'm legit surprised every time i get a wooden piece because i keep forgetting wood armor is a thing :/
---
Some people think that it may be a bug with how the rewards are being awarded but who knows. A possible fix would be to only get paladin the first time, you will likely get nothing, but going through on elder after that often leads to better reward results.
---
im only constantly in danger mod in daily ops because of that bullshit mutations
---
but otherwise? no I can clean out westtek bumping into mutants and crap like normal
---
More interior images? Outside looks nice but the single interior images looks a bit spars in my opinion.
---
Bonuses gained from food and drink will probably be shortened in duration
---
1c for ammo. Most still doesn‚Äôt sell. Ignore missiles, 40mm grenade, 10mm, .38, .50 ball. I never sell those types.
---
Prob had a wanted status, poor neewbs don‚Äôt really know that picking locks at workshops will 100% if the time summon a lvl 200+ with no mercy they will f up their day
---
This is getting so bad. Often there will be one or two teams with two or three players, I join, and nothing. I hop onto the event to see if they want to come, nothing.
---
There should be a check at the end of Daily Ops to see if players wish to stay in the group. Otherwise it disbands.
---
You mean interest is waning in repeating the same event over and over again? The same meat week with the same bugs as the last one, the same primal cuts events failing due to the same primal beast not spawning before the timer eventually runs out again? I'm so excited I could play something else for a while.
---
You can have pets. Mirelurk king has been chilling in base for over a week since I got it.
---
Yeah, that's so weird
---
I think they've completed and just stay on for the bond/laziness. Problem is they often can't be lured to play again.
---
I would, it‚Äôs pretty damned close
---
There‚Äôs already an example of this in FO4 via mods. You revisit a specific area in the capital - i believe it was the radio station? - and I‚Äôm reasonably sure it‚Äôll be the same here. They have the same feature in far cry
---
I got one where everything was named pumpkin, I shit you not
---
It‚Äôs a meme gun.  Enjoy.
---
It's just rng, I'm only missing 2 things from daily ops running 3 chracters but I've had plenty of no reward days.
---
I get this one too sometimes
---
Haha that would crack me up
---
I'm not sure about it sometimes, I play alot and I currently have 3 3* explosive fixers anf have owned quite a few non explosive versions so I obviously get then a lot more than the other people I play with. On the other side though i have done countless collosal problems and have yet to get the reclaimed miner helmet, 3 toons every day since I came out I've done the daily ops at elder or whatever is the fastest and no spec ops suit. So I think it just comes down to "RNG is RNG."
---
Every time I join that event it fails. I can't solo it, so I don't bother. I think folks honestly don't know how the event works, and they get confused when you are not just supposed to kill everything.
---
Its 80% chance to get a High Level Reward. Not 80% at a rare one. The 80% is then split into a 32% chance at the rare plans/outfits and a 48% chance at the uncommon rewards(burrows/galleria signs plans, cage lights etc)
---
[explained here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/edit#gid=0)
---
Lmao thanks for the faith. Wish it was an accepted currency in stores. xD
---
It‚Äôs close, but it isn‚Äôt exactly it. That‚Äôs what our friend above us is trying to say before he got downvoted. Smh
---
Lol...I‚Äôm dishonest?  Kinda personal don‚Äôt have think?
---
If it was/is such an easy change why push it back?
---
Unsellable and not trade able.
---
The one I am talking about is when you actually scrolling through items within a list, i.e. ,aids, weapons, etc
---
Nope, do your part, hurry through the mission markers and stay in the uplink area, everyone helps
---
This 100% speaking as a bloodied build myself it's very much a non-issue. Pool of water, toxic goo etc. Even if not then you get below 20% organically anyhow.
---
Bloodied isn't made or broken at 20%, it's just when it's at its most optimal.
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll let you know in 8-12 months after the regulatory committees have greenlit the acquisition and they‚Äôve updated their new partners with their expectations.  
---
But spoiler alert: Microsoft typically doesn‚Äôt micromanage their game developers‚Äô projects to the point of influencing patch note footnotes
---
But it still is zenimax for a long time.  Microsoft doesn't have the keys till next summer and they are gonna be dropping their full bank roll on all those new ips and elderscrolls they won't have much time for a 3 year old semi mmo.
---
Then what am I supposed to do with it? Throw it out?
---
Can't trade the plans or the item itself. It's classified as bullion item. But that does mean you can get it as a legendary from the purveyor and events if you have learned it.
---
I agree...why change a dynamic that doesn‚Äôt misbehave and already has a web of things integrated with it?
---
Thanks for explaining that, but at an 80% chance with 5 characters to still come up with SOMETHING, getting nothing at all is odd, and it's happened to some friends of mine, too. I either get a rare/uncommon reward for every single Op for the day on my account's characters, or nothing on every character. Something is wrong...
---
A positive post at last! That kind of attitude is much needed. Keep it up and have lots of fun!
---
Which is why it‚Äôs called an inspiration, otherwise it would be plagiarism üòÇ (and no, I didn‚Äôt downvoted him)
---
i run gauze sniper (instigating and furious) but im not doing many ops either though with meat week ive been using my furious plazma sniper which can fire fast as i pull the trigger
---
Hmm maybe I will skip the bow for fear of turning into rainman.The whole open the door three times and all.
---
I thought Radicool and Adrenal Reaction have stages that hit at 20%?
---
Pulowski Shelter!
---
This happens to me when I'm fighting Earle. I'll be looking directly at him and then I VATS, but target a Wendigo across the arena. Quite annoying.
---
Learn or toss it. It‚Äôs frustrating too because I‚Äôd like to get one myself lol. Rng has hated me on this one.
---
Yeah I agree its unusual
---
I just feel like they keep removing things to make the frame easier and the game becomes more shallow every time
---
Aye. Agreed.
---
Honestly it's my 4th day in a row not getting any rare reward from elder rank
---
"Graaghh -- Brother, noooooo!"
---
I guess so, but I don't know why you would want to sell your stuff
---
Naw I‚Äôm right boi now go eat your beans
---
I thought they removed the snallygaster tame spawn a while ago since it was a cryptid.
---
Get rid of ashpiles upon looting.
---
Staying by the beacons completes the mission faster. If you can do that then you‚Äôre always an MVP.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
+1 to this. Great little QoL idea.
---
No thank you.  I like having a static location for my tent so that I can waypoint to it when desired.  The change you're suggesting would make tents 84% less useful.
---
The armor is the same, but we're getting shot up in daily ops now.
---
Man.. Im about to fish for mine.. I can feel the Boards and Mr.Handy buzzsaws just waiting for me
---
It‚Äôs a low chance but it‚Äôs possible
---
It‚Äôs a lot of work on their end to make it work. They need to buff slow-firing guns so you can actually one shot tough enemies, then they need to work on the stealth part to make it more usable. If you simply squat, they‚Äôll see you from very far, but if you use objects as cover, you should be able to get much closer. Right now stealth is almost like ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô, either i can touch the ghouls and they still ignore me, or even when I hide in a different room they come straight to me.
---
Ive got 1700 hours in. I never made it a routine even though i should have. The addition of being able to eat items by holding the button made it better but the penalty you get is what i cant stand about it. At least let me travel thats my biggest gripe with it. Instead of having to backout and use the hotkey or open pipboy find food than eat.
---
*flies away with jet pack*
---
I'd name mine Jon-E
---
I‚Äôll be honest...I keep thinking of Company Tea, which is a very involved recipe w/ the benefit of having a HUGE % of drink value...I‚Äôve been enjoying gathering and making it for two years, now it‚Äôll just be a neg to disease chance...the change, like you said, doesn‚Äôt add to the depth of the game, it subtracts
---
So you join groups with team objectives just to troll people?
---
Maybe make it so you can repair individual structures at any time. The repair all button only fixes broken items, but if all items are repaired, then using that option again repairs everything that's partially damaged. Structures under 25% health have their health bars show normally. Otherwise, you need to go up to the structure and press x to see its health, or go into "edit" workshop mode.
---
You have to log out for at least 5 minutes.
---
Message Daddy Cizin. Just stay by the damn objective.
---
I like it. I was naming mine after Marty Robbins. If yours was after Johnny Cash, I vote the liberator pet also gives you access to new music from those guys.
---
I was referring to the title, OP is not the only one.
---
Yeah! One of the few new things on launch (not from FO4), but it's utterly useless. Sure, it's meant to be super low-tier armor, but considering how difficult it is to find armor pieces at low level, odds are most people skipped wood-tier entirely. It's not even that hard to think up directions to take it, either; clearly its similar to ghillie armor and should convey massive bonuses to stealth, especially when not moving etc.
---
Heck, that new legendary fire-resist perk shows that they're able to apply perks when wearing a full set, so why not just give wood-tier built-in (whatever the sneak to lose enemies perk is called) for some zero-effort balancing?
---
I have a 15% blocking armor piece, and it does indeed work. Anything with an *effective* 200 fire rate or multiple projectiles can become magic.
---
I'm having issues with magic VATS shotguns though. They sometimes will miss over and over again even with a 95% hit chance. My automatic laser with the beam splitter is great, though.
---
everything scales to your level now. So.. nooo.
---
Because I have thousands of steel, but I‚Äôd rather have caps.
---
There‚Äôs no point in farming special op events. Once you hit elder, you‚Äôre basically done for the day. Sure you could keep playing them if you‚Äôre farming ammo or you simply need to rank up and get a lot of kills. 
---
So unless you‚Äôre the type that likes helping other people do daily ops out of the kindness of your heart, than chances are people won‚Äôt do them back to back. 
---
Most people join the team, do the daily op, and then they go and do whatever it is they wanted to do. Too lazy to leave the team, or to join/make a casual team. Some people stay on the team simply because somebody else might be sharing a perk that benefits them or just because they are getting their bonuses for being on a team in general. Regardless of what that team goal might be. 
---
Now events team, simply because you join an event team, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to show up and join every single event that pops up. If it‚Äôs not worth their time, or they knows it‚Äôs a waste of ammo/stimpacks then they won‚Äôt bother showing up. 
---
They might join one or two that they like, but like I said, being on an event team doesn‚Äôt mean people will join the crappy events as soon as they pop up.
---
I can answer the question simply.It will probably never happen and if it does it will be just pc and Xbox.
---
Haha i see. My bad.
---
Good luck! üçÄü§û
---
Do you have a suppressor on it? I've heard it's bugged if you do and won't deal explosive damage
---
They just want to wring out every dollar they can from us. Doesn't matter if we are having fun, just want us to pay, pay, pay. I despise having to use a mule but I'm not getting 1st until I can go an entire day with no crashes or server disconnects, which will never happen.
---
Thank you! And will do
---
Perfect pick of songs for a fallout halloween radio.  Nicely done.
---
&gt;looks like it's made from a variety of items.
---
Ah, but you see, that would take *slightly* more time to model, and we've already cut that down by copy-pasting all of 4's homework.
---
That is weird. Couple of hours ago on pc I saw the event and jumped into. There were enough people. I assume, the guy in excavator armor started the event.
---
I always take a pylon. Though, I don't really know for how long I have to stay connected.
---
I do have a suppressor, which is pretty essential since I am a stealth build. Damn
---
They have said before this is the first mode. Next mode is stealth focused. It‚Äôs not a bug or mystery. It‚Äôs just a design that is pretty simple to get.
---
Thank you.
---
What is the recommended for Adrenaline then? I use 5 in my build just just cause it‚Äôs free damage.
---
Your presence by the beacon is more than enough help anyone could ask for.
---
Ya. And there's little difference btw those stages, even before nerf. Now it's nearly non-existent.
---
The nuka bar I think has one?
---
Adrenalinal reaction does, radicool doesn't.
---
That's for the Prime Cuts events. We're talking about the cookout itself. That one you make the counter move faster when you're on the drums and spits.
---
Does the term "emergency protocols" mean anything to you?  There's that as well.
---
So the logic behind this is. I have a single character that is stealth based (i dont) so i should skip current mod and rewards and wait for mods that fits to my build? Isnt better idea to make all opses avaliable for every game mechanic? U said it clearly maybe iam stupid i just cant see logic behind this like ,,no this content doesnt support your build, sorry‚Äù feels not that clear to me...

One of the best Easter eggs hidden in the franchise. There's another one in 76 as well, if one gets the Pulowski Preservation Shelter egg. ;)
---
There are some ants in the lower level of one of the Sunnytop buildings. They spawn at campfire tales also.
---
Fully Uny bonus too.
---
Where would this be?
---
Thanks!
---
Noticed that too
---
Someone launched two nukes. One at the mine and one at cranberry bog, most players were at the queen scorched beast event and no one showed up for colossal problem event.
---
As long as they stand near the beacon, I don't care lol
---
So, is this beacon you all speak of in every daily op?  I literally just ran around shooting pellets at invisible raiders. Haha
---
If you boost the beacon time I dont care if your level 1 or 1000.
---
Just stay at the beacon.
---
Cany say it enough
---
Stay at the beacon
---
I think priority should be given to the camp instead of giving them a time limit.
---
I've seen a massive drop on all servers (xbox). Massive. I've had random, small luck with the Mire and Bog capturing interest a couple times from high levels.
---
Ash Heap used to be my favorite, but with the patch it's a massive headache getting swarmed by OP cave crickets and radrats in the first waves. I no longer see anybody going there. I used to see some in the Toxic Valley at times, although it's a dull one anyway. Haven't seen anyone there once. Savage Valley gets some interest, but it's a busted event and usually doesn't get much. 
---
Basically, it's the Forest that pulls players of any level, the eastern, toughest ones that pull high levels very rarely, and almost nothing else. I think the patch has killed them otherwise.
---
Imo it's a completely different system, one is a monorail, the other is probably using magnetism, very very strong magnets.
---
Nice build dude!   Great eye.
---
Yup, he was wanted.
---
If only you could tame ghouls
---
It was strange.  He was just out in the middle of no where.  Idk.
---
I think they mean the downsides of letting your bars low. Are they getting rid of food downsides as well?
---
Morgantown,you do the nuka shine quest there. The speak easy behind the nuka cola machine in the bar by frat row.
---
At no point have you asked that. Read through your comments, you never once asked that you complete fucking lobotomite.
---
All good points. I guess my best bet is to create my own so that I can manage it.
---
Magnet trains, how do they work.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre willing to fully expand on pets as a part of that ‚Äúcrazier‚Äù content they‚Äôre working on? I for one would like to be able to create a lot of robots like eyebots or liberators. Like can we at least get to have non-human companions in the game, so when we aren‚Äôt traveling with real players, we can still have some sort of company?
---
I cant imagine they complete wipe the downsides or idk what would happen to Lead Belly for example
---
Had him turn up at primal cuts in ash heap once &amp; he took on the rad scorpions.
---
Didn't actually speak to him though
---
Oh! Okay, wasnt sure if you meant that one or not
---
Adapt. You can still play, usually. If you made your character so hyper focused they are impossible to play any other way? Then yes, you‚Äôre going to miss out on content.
---
I‚Äôm a vats build. Invisible enemies destroy my play style. So I play differently and accept that,against my weaknesses,I‚Äôm less effective. Can‚Äôt be a god all the time.
---
So, you mod a flamer to have a long barrel and vaporization nozzle. Then you remove the long barrel. Then you log off, log back in, and put the long barrel back on. Is that right?
---

---
I had one drop when the game came out. It was so much fun to use, but I had to get rid of it because of the 500 lb stash and I had no room
---
Pretty much. I always kept it at casual. So we get extra xp regardless of what we do. 
---
If I join an event (regardless if my team is there or not) I switch it to events real quick. 
---
Once the event is done, back to casual. 
---
Same when I join a daily ops. I get elder solo, or with a team. If they join that‚Äôs great. If they don‚Äôt it doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôll switch it to special ops right before the boss dies. Get credit for it, then set it back to casual team
---
Yeah. I think I remember a mic by the piano but I might be wrong.
---
Also get super duper from luck. It gives you a chance to double what you craft sometimes.  As for the materials, I usually hit up Lucky Hole mine to get Lead Ore using my Excavator PA since it gives you extra ore. For steel I go to Backwater mine and kill all the Mole Miners making sure to loot all their weapons. Scrap all the weapons with the Scrapper Card from Intelligence and you will get tons of steel
---
they agreed to a sale.. nothing is sold yet
---
Omg yes!!!! And we can put em either in display cases or on shelves n stuff
---
I recommend just doing the front of west tek.  Obviously less enemies vs server hop, but still really good.
---
Alright, ty, I think we can still take full use of lunch boxes then.
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs a lot of flux!
---
I just got one today
---
Oh wow, how big of a difference does that make? Almost none. Some xtra xp and vats effectiveness. I'm a bloodied low health player. You guys are missing my point.  This game already caters fully to us and you entitled ones bitch about starting at 25% hp AFTER DYING!
---
I personally don‚Äôt understand getting rid of the debuff, but a lot of people whine about it being hard to remember to eat any of the meat on practically every enemy you kill or drink anything.
---
Alright but if they are bought would u want NV content in FO76?
---
Events. Dailies. Just shoot shit and collect bobble heads/magazines/rare junk for displays. Obsessively rebuild your camp daily because that spot there gets a slightly more centered view and-shit,is that spot flat?
---
Yeeeeep.
---
Last event I traded one for 30k.....ummm, things you give someone for christmas. People pay a stupid amount for then for some unknown reason.üòÇ Took all 5 characters to hold
---
I think OP's was some random player named Irradiroot too lol.
---
Yeah, that's a good idea. Ty.
---
That would work.
---
The way it works is the flamer has a range of 15
---
the long barrel adds 15
---
the vapor nozzle removes 14
---
The bug is that the vapor nozzle overwrites the long barrel when it is calculated, which always happens when you enter a world, to make it work right you need the long barrel to go after, so you need to add it's effect when the nozzle is already in place
---
Before the pandemic hit, my boyfriend and I had plans to take our first out of country road trip to Morgantown for a NCAA game and hit up Point Pleasant for the Mothman Fest. Disappointed we couldn‚Äôt this year but hopefully next year!

Friend what is your name? I don‚Äôt see an incoming friend request so I was gonna see if I can add you on my end. Oh and I‚Äôm also in central time!
---
I've probably spent 1.2k in scrip and just get trash bone clubs and mr handy saws ;/
---
Yea u can say that or u just wont accept crappy ideas and make Bethesda do stuff properly. I feel this is just not right, the more things u accept and adapt to even it doesnt work makes them more lazy. I think ppl are just too much surrendered to Beths. U said that its basicly stupid but have no choice to accept it, thats not right. Remember that u are the one who pays, u should get content done right, not to adapt bad design.
---
Lol.  This is the LAST time I am moving my CAMP. 
---
Next day....Ok. NOW this is the last time...
---
Jeeez...well good on you!
---
If you start to upgrade and build, you will need the steel. I know I've thought I've had enough, but I eventually run out quicker than I realize. Unless you have an extractor, then that's different.
---
Yeeeep. I, personally, think it is a absolutely useless weapon. 30lb modded out... what a joke. It looks cool, but thats all I can say on it
---
Mate I've been having the bug where Vendors like Grahm at his meat cook are named an actual player, even my Stash box has been named after my friend.
---
I want the cultist one back idk how I missed it!
---
Yah.  I got a few from the event and wasn‚Äôt a fan.  They weigh so much, I just dropped them
---
The reddit game is the ultimate end game of fallout 76....

Or you could join the rest of us and either look for the invisible people, chuck molotovs, or use an explosive or Tesla weapon easier way without using chems

---
"Maybe make it so you can repair individual structures at any time.
---
I think that's what's intended but here is no way to "Repair" partially damaged CAMP items. You either scrap them and replace or wait for them to be destroyed. As for only 25% or below that I am not sure but because of what this player did to my CAMP I have many places below 25% showing but honestly I dispute that because I am quite positive some show 50 percent health, 25% etc. and full at all times. I have never had to go up to a structure and press a button to see it's health. I am on PC fwiw, I will make a video and show you what I mean.
---
Best suggestion I have is do the daily ops, the app enemies drop what kind of ammo you use and can usually get a life time supply of it if you do the daily ops.
---
I personally just make my own group unless I see that someone has made a group that very second. 
---
No point joining old groups that chances are, did it twice or three times half an hour ago and now they're just not bothered. 
---
Would be nice if there were a toggle button on the actual group like "Active/Inactive".
---
I'm not one to let down some free legendaries but there have been times where I've just run it like 50 times and even more newbies show up and I'm just like "Ehhh" \*Flicks to Casual after they join
---
There's a stage in Helvetia that has lots of instruments and a standing mic. The thing is, it might only be there during Fasnacht. It's along the creek where the creek goes under the road.

There's another stage at Watoga High School, but I don't know if it has a mic.

---
My name is Brinktown and I‚Äôm central too
---
Ah yes, well then...ha ha.
---
They made Microsoft Office, so I am pretty sure they are in favor of 'no fun'
---
With the daily ops it seems like weapon and armor degradation is amped up, granted I run a furious explosive fixer for a main weapon and a furious explosive Gatling plasma so it's automagically worse because of how many thing I hit with each shot. So the queen dropping repair kits is really nice.
---
I think what the Fo76 reddit needs to do is as a collective, create a google doc sheet and list EVERY SINGLE issue, Have categories for actual bugs
---
Quality of Life improvements 
---
And suggestions
---
Farm blood bugs for easy acid. Scrap blood bug proboscis for 2 acid. Do the meat week event in ash heap right now for cave crickets. They drop a lot of acid. Go mine lead deposit with excavator pa from lucky hole mine. If you‚Äôre getting less than 500+ lead ore you‚Äôve missed some deposits.
---
Cool, I will have to try that!
---
That sounds like so much fun! I hope that you can go next year. We definitely didn't do much more than sightseeing due to the pandemic. It was nice to walk around new areas though
---
100% hated getting bone clubs lol
---
&gt; The Brotherhood of Steel questline will have choices and consequences/"arcs" based on choices.
---
Neat, are they gonna bug out and not count like in Wastelanders?
---
I could do without enduring cazadors with 1wasteland mechanics thank you very much
---
Daily Ops are far more rewarding and, dare I say, fun.
---
They're more than that.
---
The stars are the end cap cover to long support rods within the building. These rods counteracted the natural shifting that takes place when a building settles. They prevented walls from cracking and more serious damage from occurring.
---
Not just in the south either, if anything they're more common up north where brick buildings had to contend with water seepage that would freeze and heave I would put a significant amount of stress on buildings.

Chat box plz. It‚Äôs hard to play a multiplayer game when my communication is restricted to a few emotes, pointing my gun, jumping and crouching.
---
They say it's almost Heaven, West Virginia.
---
I think Fallout 76 should still retain it‚Äôs own identity within it‚Äôs setting. Sure that would cool to see stuff we have gotten before but I think unique content should come first.
---
I agree on that especially with vats selecting the whole enemy rather than parts of them to cripple
---
I get that one occasionally after I revive someone
---
Daily Ops is one of the few events that truly encourages teamwork.
---
People still use that much rad away? With what rads I o my need like 50 diluted at a time.
---
I wouldn't recommend either for earl or queen.
---
It will be
---
i totally agree. i try to repair a piece of armor at a workbench and get like a several second freeze time lol
---
Here's video totally contradicting what you're saying. Not sure if you just don't play 76 or are just making stuff up but here you can see items of varying degrees of damage from 80% to 10%, not just 25% and I never once had to click on anything to see it's health. - https://youtu.be/HbR9KLs6htQ
---
I think all the daily ops are annoying. The increased perception should be a mutation like everything else.  Super annoying that you can‚Äôt sneak at all.
---
I remember always needing it at low levels. I barely use it now, and even I do I use diluted. I realized I had around 450 regular radaway in my inventory, so I figured I'd give it to noobs
---
Trying to be more clear as why I'm in doubt
---
See I was seeing the AA damage roughly double the two shot damage at each projectile
---
I saw 20 aa and 10 for the two shot
---
Would they function around the same or would it still outperform? Also not taking in consideration armor penetration perk for this damage 
---
And speaking of the perk would it be more beneficial a two shot + stabilized because of double projectile plus ap or aa + ap would destroy that entirely?
---

The train in FO76 is a monorail attached to a track. This is completely different. They are both elevated trains, but so is the L in Chicago.
---
I really like my BE Gatling Plasma for Part of the Earl fight, with one gun army I can cripple all the things quickly, then switch to my .50 to kill spawns
---
Well if we are using super real stats tonight.  I would have you know i would rember I had a tent to travel to 63 percent of the time when I was notified when it was recalled.   I mean its just a moving scrap box for me I am sure I have left it in some places that oissed off some camp owners.
---
What would be good weapons for them? I never really got to know what's the fallout meta or something like that
---
yo dude I can't respond to your DM on reddit, can you message me at Omeganian#1835, I'm still interested in the flamer
---
Personally I prefer vampire weapons at low health, as if they were bloodied.  They do similar damage, but I tank Earl's acid attacks and take no damage.
---
The outfits seem to not drop at all for anything.
---
Oh i got scammed after the update if they are bugged jokes on them.
---
Yes all weapons except certain heavys quad pump is available
---
I agree, I to have been afk, but put my character to turn the meat over the fire.  Not afk often though.
---
Tru it has it's own setting. With the BOS coming to West Virginia they should have an event with liberty prime.
---
I still run at least 2 nukes a play period, 1st at sbq and second at earl.   I usually still have at least a full 8 in my team to fight him.  Every once in a while it‚Äôs only 1 to 3...But not often.   
---
I feel like we get better 3 star weapon chances with earl.  Almost always get something decent from him.  Sbq it‚Äôs usually 1 or 2 star crap except the repair kits.
---
If a game is on console as well as PC it will always be held back. Console is a plague on this earth. Get a PC
---
Yes it is, just today I received one from the purveyor but exchanged it for scrip. But yes, you should get a quad ammo pump action shotgun.
---
meat weeks still goin for a 2nd helping as they said.. but nobodys really doin it. Waste of effort on bethesdas part.
---
Sure man
---
Happened to me just now as well. I hope I can keep running it to get the reward.
---
Can't wait to load 32 rounds into the chamber one at a time (yes I know it'll play the default 8 round reload, but I can dream)
---
The DM flip up panel hasn't been working for me either, I had to open the actual message page in Reddit to get it working, just kept saying "Failed to send message"
---
You can still do a sniper build but when it comes to daily ops, you need to pay attention to your perk cards. I run a stealth commando build but stealth doesn't work in Daily ops so for eg, before I do a daily ops, I swap a couple of perk cards over. I get rid of perks like escape artist and sneak which are useless and equip things like evasive and moving target. Also try to pick up a couple of armour types that will help you in Daily ops too. I'm set with my armour for daily ops but when I do Earle Williams, I swap my jet pack ss chest for another chest piece that is modded with asbestos lining for fire resistance and is renamed Earle chest so I can quickly equip (for eg). You could do the same for ops. Something as simple as switching a few perks out for a specific event can make a big difference...
---
Faster reload really helps that weapon out a bunch I always like the combat shotgun better because it does a one clip reload
---
Damn, that reminds me of a dude I ran into early in the game. I think I was at a train station or something. I turned around, and there's a guy in a clown suit and a Fasnacht man mask on the other side of the room. He just slow walked toward me... very, very slow... I think I logged off, lol.
---
What's the benefit of even AFKing this in particular?
---
I think you can open photo mode and it won‚Äôt kick you
---
Spend that gold bullion and grind the factions.
---
He attacks you after awhile. :') Or at least he did me.
---
Just sent you a friend request on Discord, "Flippin" with all fancy letters
---
I wish the various types of throwables were actually worth using
---
The base throwing knives you start the game with are great as a starting weapon at 75 damage, but then all the unlockable throwing items are just trash, and not worth using over the starter.
---
The meat cleaver is a heavier, more expensive throwing knife that only looks cool.
---
The sheepsquatch shard is a super rare, super expensive, pain in the butt to get in any sort of number and are literally just throwing knives that have an extra 3 bleed damage over 5 seconds.
---
The tomahawk is the only one that is an upgrade, being more expensive but dealing 100 damage.
---
There is no reason for all the added throwing weapons to be so terrible.
---
amazing dude i love the lighting
---
I run the pump largely for aesthetic reasons. I have/had an explosive +250 DR while reloading combat, but it broke so bloody fast
---
I about gagged reading ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually pretty balanced‚Äù.
---
PvP in this game is a pitiful sham and it never should have been attempted. Just the regular game as a FPS is questionable and they wanted to add PvP in the mix?
---
It is very difficult to find a happy medium between PvE and PvP in any game and very few have ever achieved it.
---
Let people mill about Appalachia blasting irradiated monster in peace.
---
Gauss minigun maybe?
---
Last night I got the Paladin rank with no rare reward and then ran it again to get the Elder rank earning the Symtomatic. However I think once you get the Elder rank, all rewards are standard from that point on.
---
No. 
---
You get 1 CHANCE at a rare reward per tier per day. 
---
You‚Äôre not guaranteed a rare for the day. 
---
If you got elder and didn‚Äôt get a rare, sorry, try again tomorrow.
---
If you reached elder, you are done for the day whether you got a reward or not. No reason to do it again (if you are only interested in rare rewards). And actually you can get up to 3 rewards a day, if you get very lucky, for each unlocked rank.
---
Did I bitch? It was a suggestion. That 5% won't make someone take another radaway.
---
There is still RNG involved, you get a chance to earn a rare reward the first time you unlock each tier that day, so if you earn Elder  the first time you do an Op after reset you earn all three chances at a rare reward.  After that you can only earn the basic reward  until the daily reset.
---
I believe those were call Maximum Capacity weapons. No idea if there still in the game. I‚Äôve never got one.
---
Can't say about one outperforming the other but I used a TSE GP in ACP and it was broken before the event ended.
---
I wanted to do it for the longest time when it first started but it was over by the time I would load into the event. I still try now but no one goes near it anymore :(
---
Greed.  Aggressively taking something just to take it. I'm sure the guy? has no use for it.

Skeet Shooter improves the accuracy and spread of your shotguns. Enforcer gives shotguns a chance to stagger and/or cripple mobs.
---
 [I should nuke Westek](https://imgflip.com/i/4gc2e2).
---
Definitely. Ever since the start of the game, pistols, even with the best legendary rolls, never have competed with anything in the end game
---
I hope so too! Our fingers are crossed that by this time next year we will be able to travel safely again. He‚Äôs not into fallout all that much so I‚Äôm hoping I can sneak in a few big ticket destinations along the way!
---
I accidentally joined this when I was level 10, I had no idea what to do so I stayed playing the drums while other level 100+ or so fought the enemies
---
It can be worth it but it depends on if it's coming at the cost of a bunch of other perks that would help, so it depends on what weapon you're using and how you want to deal damage.
---
Okay I‚Äôll send a request and we‚Äôll see what happens from there. The game is much more fun when people help each other out!
---
I do this and most of the time the noobs look at it and don‚Äôt take it so at least someone takes yours lol
---
I‚Äôve had tons of luck with Earle dropping good stuff haha that‚Äôs why I want to run it again
---
Say it again for the people in the fucking back. I can not STAND when people are by it, then just run off and lolly-gag. Like, dude, what are you doing.
---
Nice it worked!
---
Best source of acid is now wendigo teeth, you get buckets full at ACP.
---
TS E slap a splitter on it, you will get clustered magic by entering vats along with hitting the queen or earl sometimes for absurd amounts. I have a BE split gat plasma and would love to have a TSE gat plasma double the damage since the it calculated pre nerfs to both TS and explosive. Sometimes you will see card damage per pellet also.   
---
Just make sure you play it smart and don't turn yourself into a goo pile.
---
All you need are the codes
---
Maybe try to go alone and get initiate first and see how your chances are, then you can go get another chance when you go with a team to get elder.
---
Yeesh. That's like Jeff Bezos showing up at the food bank and clearing the place out.
---
I‚Äôll add you
---
Just need to get the launch card again. Codes you can just google and there is a site with each silo's codes.
---
The easiest way to solo to my mind is a vampires auto of some kind. For the robot ones a full suit of trouble shooter armor helps
---
Mind you that mirelurk queen will be miles away and still vats prioritizes that fucker
---
Negative, you can't use the crafting material in cooking only the consumable item. 
---
It's almost been two whole years now and we've never gotten any sort of formal acknowledgement as to why the honey beasts only drop the crafting material version or why a crafting material version even exists other than for scrap.
---
You joke about the .38 Automatic Pipe right now, but when you see it in practice will you be laughing then?
---
Haha... Noobs don't seem to understand that people want to give them stuff. It's not an exploding loot bag, I promise!
---
Why am I muted
---
I'm at a friends house at the moment so I will not be online for another two hours or so. Alternatively I will be online tomorrow if you want. My Id is eldyrus3.
---
There was nothing stopping Bethesda from bringing anything from New Vegas to FO76. They fully own everything related. As for bringing in Obsidian to help with FO76, I don't think that would make sense. They have  games in their pipeline that they have active development on, Outer Worlds, Grounded, Avowed and an unnamed project. Even having them make a spin off game would take too many resources away from them so I wouldn't expect them start doing anything fallout stuff for a while.
---
Yes! I'd rather mods for existing weapons than new weapons.
---
Flesh out the current content.
---
Thank you for visiting, Fallout 76 and the community has done more for Wv tourism than our last three governors combined.   Come back anytime
---
S10?
---
Yeah ive literally got a bloodied explosive western revolver and it doesnt complete with anything like ive got explosive perks and vats perks, with one wasteland its a lil bit better but still like come on
---
i just traded a b2525 hand made for them 
---
thank god that grind wasnt for nothing.
---
It's a kind of british gas mask, in game it was the mask, a hood, and a headset
---
I keep my tent at a train station for free fast travel to that station. I really only move it when I desperately need to get carry weight back or if I‚Äôm near death at the end of an event. Otherwise it stays put. What you‚Äôre suggesting is that I‚Äôd have to replace my tent between events which would defeat the purpose of keeping in one spot. And I‚Äôm sure other people do this too. I definitely am not opposed to the idea of my tent de-spawning to put someone else‚Äôs camp in that location, especially if they‚Äôre running a vending machine. I get what you‚Äôre saying, and personally I‚Äôd like an option to recall my tent (so people can‚Äôt stand on the roof during scorched earth), but I think it should spaced out more like you‚Äôd have to place your tent every time you log in. Then I‚Äôd be more inclined to put it at a different train station.
---
great tip.
---
The special ops mask?
---
I think it might be my new favorite non-heavy after turning it into an automatic rifle.  It really rips.
---
?
---
Just need a nuke card and google nukacrypt.
---
I guess so idk, havent played in like a year
---
yeah theres many videos out there showing you theres not a giant drop off at all.
---
acid damage and a jet pack +the cool look 
---
its worth it.
---
I loved that quest.
---
Ammo machine from the raiders produces 200 rounds of 5.56 about every hour or so. So if you fire off less than 200 in an hour, you actually slowly gain ammo without having to do anything.
---
Just got home (5 hours later than planned) and I walked into the TV showing ‚Äúdisconnected from server‚Äù. 
---
So no idea at this point how long ago I got kicked, but I definitely got kicked at some point.
---
The poison damage doesn't really do much either.  Objectively, the best pa is pretty much excavator.
---
Change the language. It‚Äôs not 80% chance at a reward. It‚Äôs a 20% chance to get no reward.
---
Reminds me of the this machine in fallout new Vegas
---
I'd love to use T65 but that bullion grind is something else. Does it make a big difference over T51b?
---
Go back to the enclave bunker in the command center, where the Armory is. Use the terminal to find where there's a nuke card escort flying around.
---
Do that quest you get to acquire a nuke card, or buy one from a player vendor, look for people with 'MISC' in their vendors. Maybe you've already got a couple in yoru inventory already, make sure that they're on your player character and not in your stash.
---
Go to [Nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com/) get the nuke codes.
---
Go to the silos
---
Survive the onslaught.
---
Use your card, enter your codes.
---
Boom.

---
That‚Äôs what I respecced to. I‚Äôm 49 levels off of my sixth legendary perk but I‚Äôm likely going to take Endurance over Sizzling Style.
---
I‚Äôm terrible at keeping Adrenaline going but I do take advantage of it when I can.
---
me too hard to shake away the yield bonus
---
It's a different thing, a sci-fi franchise to be exact.
---
The other Easter egg is Tanagra Town.
---
It's a bit more effective on a double-barrel.
---
There's a 44 called The Troubleshooter in the game files that has a bull barrel. Everything I've read says it will be a reward from upcoming BOS content.
---
Yeah, the extra ore is definitely nice.  Literally the only reason I use t 65 right now is the jetpack arms.
---
Farm a loop that takes at least 20 minutes.  FT back to your camp.  Log off and back on.  Repeat.  If the location hasn't had 20 minutes to reset or if you are at a location when you log back in, it won't produce mobs.
---
Edit: you don't have to wait when you log off to log back on.  You can do it immediately.  I run the DMV, Whitesprings, Westek and the National Isolated Radio Array.  FT back to camp, log off and back on, then do it all again in the same order.  Works every time.
---
I‚Äôll take it.
---
It's a rare reward from daily ops if you get Elder rank.
---
You get it from doing the ops. Once per day, you have a 3x roll chance at getting something. So you can either get 3 items, or nothing at all. When you're looking at the map, it's in the bottom left corner.
---
Wtf, Elder Rank??
---
Oh my god please
---
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
---
You clearly never had the pleasure of meeting Clippy.
---
Elder rank just means finishing the daily op in under 8 minutes. It's a lot easier than it sounds.
---
wait what? like in game?
---
Ok, cool, so is it a guaranteed drop?
---
I‚Äôm on board with camp priority over anything
---
You‚Äôre not using VATS are you
---
I've got a bloodied pipe-bolt and a revolver, they're both good for snipers, but the bloodied auto pipe runs everything out of the yard.
---
Not at all, it's pretty rare. I bought mine from a player vendor for 5k caps and felt it was a good purchase.
---
Ok cool, so its sellable. I'll just vendor/world hop then. Thanks bro
---
Alas, I'm not a shot gunner xD
---
I appreciate the offer.
---
You should take this to the marketplace reddit
---
Talk about a rip off.
---
Got any Commando build weapons?
---
LOL it sucks.   Very realistic though.. annoyingly so.  After the quest is over, the DMV is a great farming location for XP, one of my favorites due to the sheer amount of XP available and the speed at which it can be achieved.  Just boot Department B when you enter, clear the building and then boot Department C when you are ready to leave.  You'll get 5-10 additional mobs after you boot B and C.
---
It‚Äôs this kind of stuff I don‚Äôt get about Bethesda‚Äôs choices. You can‚Äôt even see stuff like power, even though the game uses a lot of Fo4‚Äôs assets.
---
Maybe they should make each silo unique. Silo Bravo, being near the toxic valley, could have some parts of the silo that are different, and exposed to chemicals. Silo A, being near water, could be flooded in some areas. Silo Charlie could have sentient ghouls with weapons to prevent you from launching a nuke.
---
I usually quite opa group after finishing the ops
---
Vats doesn‚Äôt work in pvp with certain guns rn
---
Theres a marketplace reddit?
---
Yes to this but it has to be from Settlers! Settlers kinda of pointless to make friends unless you want to grow crops instantly with a gernade, plant crops on concrete, or create a cement well.
---
The battle rifle would be awesome in this game
---
I think Obsidian should stay the heck away from 76 or any of BGS' future titles. It would hurt the IP more than it would help.
---
I‚Äôm only level 36 and have had 70 radaways from just doing quests. I think the hazmat suit is what stopped a real need for it. Cause awhile ago I was looking for people with decontam showers.
---
Uhh... I‚Äôm 80% certain it‚Äôll load all 32. individually.  Quad lever action and single action are also like this IIRC
---
You'd be surprised how many people want those things that badly
---
Day 11 and the repeats have only just begun? Some people have all the luck.
---
The "84% less useful" was a lame attempt at humor.  But to add some ammunition to my argument, you would have a lot of angry players who are paying for FO 1st if you nerf what has become a normal gameplay benefit for the extra fee that they pay.   Land claiming has always been first come, first served, no reason for that to change now.
---
It seems to me that if you leave them built they stay built for the next person who comes along.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me about a couple months ago
---
Sadly no, my first character is a sneak rifleman, haven't taken the time to try commando. I found this on my second character :/
---
Thank you for the advice. I just want to make sure I can expect to be able to complete most of the content in the game with my preferred weapons. I'll be playing mostly by myself and focusing on completing quests and building my Camp.
---
you think that wait is long? imagine waiting for real end game content
---
It makes my Handmade and Fixer feel quaint in a weird way
---
Alright.
---
&gt; people will be sick of having these plans drop very soon.
---
I'm sick of NOT having it drop. Every day I think "Today's the day!", and... nope.
---
AA might outperform junkies, except for Junkies being a ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù effect.
---
For way more than that though, 5k is insanely cheap for it.
---
Bruh moment
---
Most of the workshops provide materials for crafting.  They will show up in green when you build there.  When you leave you will lose whatever you built and no materials will be returned to you, but most of the time you won't have spent much due to the workshop's free materials cache.
---
Not anymore and there is no selling on this sub.....keep it moving!
---
Yeah, people have been getting like, legacies for them.
---
I got 3 today. Lol
---
I'm getting this on pc.
---
Can confirm - the suppressor completely negates explosive damage
---
I think Junkies does a little more but I‚Äôm not sure now honestly. It might be situational, with AA being better against his DR enemies and Junkies being better against bullet sponges.
---
Keep the AA for now but you may find the junkies is better later. Just compare damage when you get one.
---
Also if you‚Äôre a riflemen I can maybe hook you up with a junkie rifle? If you want one
---
That's not how it works.
---
I think they broke it.  Sometimes I get 1000 and other times I get 500 while today I got 250 and jumped back up to 1000.  All over the place.
---
Yup it‚Äôs supposed to happen. Thus why it‚Äôs an ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù sentry boy hehe
---
The balance of it needs to be fixed.
---
If you don't manage it in any way it mega drains your ap and kills you, and the effect of cutting your ap by 25% hits instantly, which can ruin you if you need that ap for perks/melee/vats very quickly
---
If you slam back resources (food/water) you get the tiniest most inconsequential hp/ap/disease resistance buff that lasts all of 45 seconds and you will never notice if it is active unless the loss of it literally kills you because of the hp buff loss.
---
You should be rewarded for being a food based build, but you are not, and if you don't do the minimum you get hit by insane penalties.
---
There is a character in the game don't starve I feel embodies what the game's food system should be.
---
Wolfgang has a big stomach, and when he is well fed he is by far the strongest character in the game, having increased everything up to 50% more health, double damage, and 25% movement speed. He can tank monsters with his bare hands that would kill any other character, BUT his food drains 3x faster in this form, so it is very temporary.
---
When in his middle form he is a mostly normal character
---
When his hunger gets low he enters a weak form where he has incrementally reduced stats, but his hunger loss rate goes down more slowly, meaning if you are trying to be conservative and can handle the other debuffs this can be a useful state to maintain.
---
The  food bar needs to be BIGGER, with bigger effects on the top end to justify existing.
---
Lets say current food bar is 100 units, you gain buffs/debuffs at 75/25
---
Make the food bar have 1000 units, so you have a lot more leeway between fed and starving.
---
Increase the well fed max buff to levels similar to the magnitude of Wolfgang's, so you get major benefits to being full health that make jamming a dozen steaks in your face really powerful. 
---
An example of what well fed should be, not taking into account perks for stronger well fed buff, these would scale from half values at 750 food to max strength at 950+:
---
25% move speed (same as speed demon), 100 max health, 25% melee/unarmed damage, immune to disease, 400% faster hunger drain.
---
SO you could be an absolute monster, but for very limited times and would need to constantly shovel huge amounts of food into your face.
---
The debuffs from starving should be toned down, so they are manageable, and your food should drain slower when starving as well as other side bonuses so you might not mind, or even prefer being in a starving state, possibly tying bonuses or perks to being starving, like a ravenous hunger perk that causes you to deal more damage when starving like a sort of situational bloody mess perk.
---
I like this as it makes speed demon essentially like having a permanent part of the well fed bonus.
---
Haha this is definitely a thing. When I first log in and get ready to sleep for my kindred spirit boost I can see Raider Punk make for the bed.
---
I can't give you the details on how long or how far away the aggro lasts, but if you sneak around for a while the bots lose interest in you.  Some of the far away ones won't always even realize that you've been a bad boy.
---
Yeah, I had the popup that someone created a DO team. I immediately joined, then 2 others joined. Leader never started the op. You JUST formed the team, sir! You couldn't possibly have had time to start doing something else before the team filled up. Start the op.
---
I love looking at Tanagra Town (got my camp facing it) bur what is the easter egg related to it (is it to do with the cultish head in it?)
---
"Department B is for renewals only, please requeue and start over in Department C"
---
Sorry, wish I could share the drop luck. I did have a 2 days where I got nothing if that helps?
---
Getting it on PS4, it seems to be for all notifications that would appear in the top left. I.e picking plants, wood scrap etc.
---
Don‚Äôt think you can rn but oof
---
Rip
---
Thanks, I do have a junkies LMG but it's level 30, really can't use it cause ammo is rare and don't wanna prime a low level weapon. And it's fine, thanks for the offer though üôå
---
My camp and everything in it was call amradd77. Then I found that same name on a player while doing sbq, 5 mins later. Straight up thought some hackery was going on and quit lol
---
5% for elder, gets rarer the slower you complete them, elder is sub 8 minutes
---
I'm glad it's more difficult now. One-shotting 85% of the enemies was getting boring. 
---
But, the scaling does have issues.  Meat Week for example. During "Primal Cuts" I'm more worried about the mole rats than the 3 Yao Guais barreling down on me.
---
Big yikes. Wrong sub, wrong request.
---
Would an assassins 3 star ultracite gatling laser count for a legacy?
---
Why do people act like this is a problem? It deals far more damage than it heals. 1-2 shots kill a ghoul without any special buffs, a ghoul slayer's one should be able to one tap them
---
That's not what I read from multiple posts. Even with pacifist mode on, if the other player doesn't have it on, they can still hit you. The Bethesda website Q/A also says even in pacifist mode, others can still attack you but the damage is reduced. I want to know how much is the reduction.
---
difference is moot. it clearly triggered you enough to have a cry about it on here. and if you dont want people chiming in, dont ask?
---
some people are rich. some people like to buy things.
---
Mostly legacies are explosive energy weapons.  They're called that because they can't be obtained anymore except by trading.
---
Nice to know I'm using exactly that 
---
Tse with splitter so I can wipe mobs for cc on events so people can stay in peace 
---
And yeah happened more than I'd like to admit
---
Sometimes it wasn't my fault though one split second is enough to kill myself
---
Well done. Thank you!

&gt;age to other players.

---
&gt;ReplyGive AwardshareReportSave
---
Yes, but it doesn't stop others from hurting you either. I want to know how much does it reduce if you're in pacifist mode while they aren't.
---
I want co-OP emotes like portal 2 co-OP had. I want to high five people dude.
---
because the amount of money is truly trivial to a full time working professional.
---
Nope. Reference to a different science fiction franchise, that has had 6 series on TV, 13 movies, and three streaming-service-only series that are currently going on.
---
Tanagra Town is a reference to the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 2 of season 5, titled Darmok. One of the memorable lines from that episode is "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra", and "Darmok + Jalad" is on the wall of the train station building at Tanagra Town.
---
The Pulowski Preservation Shelter takes its name from the chief medical officer's name from Star Trek The Next Generation season two, Dr. Katherine Pulaski. 
---
Well, I should say the name is very similar, and sounds the same when verbalized.
---
Some skins from NV would be nice and considering the service rifle existed during the Great War, it should make an appearance in 76. We already have the NVR Veteran Ranger armor and Desert Ranger armor, even if they are anachronistic to the time period.
---
Crazy, never even seen a legacy I think. Maybe once I had one but idk what happened to it, I believe I sold it maybe for like 5k or gave it away to a friend
---
I don‚Äôt think you can dupe after 22, I hope.
---
I totally agree the xp should be ramped back up to at the bare minimum daily ops levels. 
---
They should make it long for first time runs on new accounts at least still. It was pretty fun showing my friend a nuke run and he was proud when we made it through on our first attempt without any exploits or even hacking any terminals lol. Just a sloppy grind that we made through with grit.
---
Maybe just let us choose whether or not to skip to the last room.
---
Yeah but I'm not gonna complain
---
As of this update TS weapons are so much more durable in my opinion that it's actually fun to use now so I'm all good in repairing with the improved toolkits
---
Grilled radstag. You don't even have to hunt them, just remember where you can find the carcasses hanging. Meat Week has a few chunks of meat to grab, and a few hanging, including one down at the moonshiner shed. 2 hanging carcasses at Camden Park in the camp surrounded by the coaster track. A few at the campsite in Flatwoods(you can also kill some Brahmin if you want to make the Ribeyes). Blood Eagle camps frequently have a few hanging around. If you want an easy hunt, Colonel Kelly monument usually has an epic battle royale between radstags and yogis. Chuck a grenade or fry 'em with a Tesla for tons of radstag meat.
---
Pepperoni roll is great, but the ingredients are harder to come by. Radstag meat and wood is all you need for Grilled Radstag.
---
Thanks for volunteering.  
---
These might help you get started.

^ None of my ammo sells anymore because people just farm daily ops. Ultracite ammo is so easy now.
---
I will keep in mind, adrenal reaction probably, friend of mine said it's like a passive bloodied but like kinda weak but fun to work with vampire weapons with high RoF
---
A few people made it there without buying levels legit and otherwise. Anyone doing the LITS exploit is either close to or 100 already.
---
Considering this is the Fallout version of GI Joe action figures would have been a perfect fit. Some magazines/comics to find randomly around the wastes would be nice too, since frankly I don't know a single thing about these guys beyond what we see on the game board.
---
&gt; if you drink a different beer before the negative effect kicks in (after fast travel) you‚Äôll lose all effects and not get the debuff. 
---
Never thought to do this! Thanks.
---
Wow...
---
Yeah, so currently the objectives of Daily Ops are the same with the only variables being the map, enemy type, and one mutation. After repairing the uplink, there will be two beacons that you need to activate and hold for a period of time until the bar is filled. The more people in the area of a beacon, the faster the bars fill (you'll know you're in range if your compass glows). After that there will be an indicated area where you need to eliminate enemies to draw out the boss.
---
It's not important to kill things during the uplink/beacon objectives, only getting to the objective with your group and staying near the beacons. Killing is really only important during the last two objectives and even then only the marked enemies.
---
Pretty much, if your with a group that knows what they're doing, you just have to stick with them and you should be fine. Play it a few times and you'll notice that the objective spots for each map are set so you'll know where to go eventually for each map. What people are looking for in teammates are bodies on the beacons as they're the most time consuming part. Most high level players won't mind carrying you damage/kills wise if you do that.
---
Edit: Grammar
---
Don't pay any attention to elitist high level dicks.  Join the event, do what you can, and stay near the uplink if you can.  If the other players on the team are worth a crap, they won't have any trouble handling the enemies even if all you do is stand by the uplink and boost the speed.  Just do your best and try to stay alive.
---
For sure.  Iirc in my testing vamp does about 30% less damage over all.  However when I fight earl or queen, I stand right in front of them and head shot them until they die.
---
Until they actually bother to balance the weapon damage calculations there is little reason to use Junkies if you have equal/better roles on AA,TSE weapons.  There is a lot right in patch 22 , but the damage rebalance was half assed.
---
honestly we just care about plushies
---
"It just works."
---
I saw someone with even numbered 200+ magazines...
---
*Cries in Gun-Fu*
---
Anyway, best bet would probably be to try daily ops and hopefully get one.
---
Probably having the whole train surrounded in a magnet that would repulse from the magnetic loops, allowing it to float. Perhaps the front or back nose of the train could be the opposite of what is being use to repulse the train, that way it can go in one direction or the other. Something like that.
---
Someone recently made a post suggesting that we could use a drill to repair structures, and I think that would be a good fix (and give a useless weapon a use).
---
Tell that to all the people displaying those robot figures.
---
I mean only thing you can probably sell are fusion cores and plasma cores since I don‚Äôt usually see the enemies drop them.
---
but ammo factory and ammosmith with super duper just makes selling them worthless.
---
Those are secretly plushie bots! üòπ
---
Mr fuzzy confirmed
---
Heh, thanks.
---
I actually took a pic of the "Darmok + Jalad" heart as I thought it was cute that even in a wasteland there were expressions of love (could be a tad different for those in the know though...)
---
(actually also have a pic of the Pulowski shelter in Charleston as the line of scorched bodies leading to it tugged at my heartstrings)
---
As a Gauss Rifle user, I feel this immensely.
---
Gets worse with a Quad Gauss Rifle...
---
Same. Is it too much to ask for a rapid firing single-action revolver with decent damage?... probably lol Oh well, there are other worlds than these.
---
You do get cores if you complete the op with the set weapon. It'll be in the rewards screen. It's like two though but in most cases 8s still more than you used.
---
That‚Äôs about what I take, a bit less. I‚Äôve got 288 DR and 223 ER. My advice is to work on positioning so that you just don‚Äôt get hit as much anymore.
---
I have FO1, and the scrapbox is obviously the most valuable item.  So I wouldn't ever expect it to be cheap.
---
That being said, I'd be fine with a lower tier of FO1 that offered a limited scrapbox and tent for half price or so.  Maybe the scrapbox could hold a max of a thousand of each scrap.  I wouldn't feel at all cheated by them offering some kind of lower priced membership with limited perks.
---
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any notes or terminals beyond what was already there, sadly. But still, good to see some new content!

I love a good camp. Great job!

I just started and this is something that's surprised me. I was on the verge of dying, completely out of Stimpacks and surrounded by ghouls when a rando high level appeared out of nowhere and dropped a bunch of chems and crafting plans. I wasn't expecting that kind of generosity, it's good to know there are players who make an effort to help new players, it's vital to keeping an online community like this alive for longer.
---
Yea same thing happened to me.
---
Weeks went by before I realized it but it was way too late by then
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean they can still dupe. However I sus pink, they‚Äôre vending.
---
Came to say this. I‚Äôll take low levels over no players any day. 
---
The only Op I actually would rather have better builds for is the resilient robots. Otherwise come one, come all!
---
Yup. The middle of the daily op involves you "boosting a signal" by remaining close to a beacon for a period of time (actually two beacons). The more people that stay close, the faster it goes, which is important for getting a good time (it is possible to do daily ops in less than 8 minutes solo, but quite difficult compared to just having a team stand near the beacon). I'd suggest looking up a quick guide on Youtube to see what these beacons are and how close you need to stay to them to keep boosting the time.
---
Good advice throughout. If you‚Äôre on PC I can make you a set of excavator armor with calibrated shocks, STR mods and a helmet mod. All I need is the lower armor frame.
---
That's why I said possible, but these were all things you'd want duped. Extra xp, high AP, plasma damage. Nothing like CAMP move cost.
---
It‚Äôs missing a subjugator icon moving along the board like the first season had. It could have been two styles of tanks racing each other.
---
Oh? How does it work?  Maybe I misspoke about the Initiate rank, but the gist is the same.
---
&gt; I was wondering what the general opinion on this was?
---
I started a fresh character when the patch dropped and reached the 20s within a few days. For my perks I simply chose quality of life perks that assisted with carry capacity and ignored all of the damage boosting, damage reduction, etc perks. For my gear I simply crafted and modded a pipe revolver and a hunting rifle. Said character has had zero trouble with the changes so far.
---
My highest level character to date is level 50. This was my second highest level character. Hopefully that provides you with a rough idea of how experienced I am. I have never made a specialized build like so many people. I have never had a decent legendary weapon.
---
I have hundreds of hours in Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4. I'm almost always playing normal or lesser difficulties. I don't play anything harder because enemies are just bullet sponges and the "tactics" people suggest are just exploiting the mechanics effectively canceling out the difficulty.
---
you're essentially paying the price it would cost for 1500 atoms alone but getting bonus stuff with it.  not sure why people keep complaining about 1st not being worth it or having different packages for different prices.  if they did that they'd have to reduce the amount of atoms in each separate package and decide what other bonuses to limit.  like the stash box for example.  how would you go about halving something that's unlimited?  $15 for a full sub for the month really isn't that much considering the cost of atoms and you save even more if you get the year for $100 if you plan on being subbed that long.
---
Haha!  Merry Christmas from Todd!
---
Seriously man, I feel your pain.
---
Well they didn‚Äôt say that they don‚Äôt have plans for it, in fact they said there was a lot of talk about it, they said that later on they most likely will do something.
---
I‚Äôm a player from beta, which means nothing but I don‚Äôt think there is a dupe method out rn but the items that have been? Surely. üòº
---
incorrect, prime receiver drops prime ammo can confirm for prime plasma caster.
---
My stealth sniper is more than fine. Ops are a bit more difficult, but nothing impossible. The only ones who can't play a sniper after One Wasteland are the ones who couldn't play one before either.
---
Microsoft would own the group, they will decide what games are available on what platforms but I can't see them micro managing the content of those games. It's not usually how these things work. One thing I would hold out hope for that I didn't previously is a FO5/6 with quality single player content.
---
If you get initiate, you roll initiate, obviously.  But if you get paladin or elder, you roll all tiers equal to or lower than what you got.  So if you get elder first try, in terms of rare plans, you're done for the day.
---
Ohhh that‚Äôs good to know thanks for confirming this
---
Good point, yeah. Well and his name was along the lines of "todd dupe" so... Ya know...
---
Don't be a rat.  Nothing to see here.
---
As an energy weapons main who just started playing, those vending machines are always disappointing. If I want to use my laser rifle, crafting is my only real option for ammo right now.
---
Good hunting man, I alternate gauss shotty and prime plasma caster to keep ammo up on both my weapons, just remember to loot after boss but before the timer hits zero
---
That outfit fits perfectly in Fallout. We need it desperately. Not just another reskin of the Railroad armor.
---
The more the merrier!
---
Just follow the high level and stick to the beacons!
---
Tag the mobs for xp and get carried. If they're scaled to your level (not sure if One Wasteland applies to Daily Ops), and you're dealing significant damage, then take them all on.
---
If not, don't worry, just tag and save your ammo. Any high level to starts the Op with low levels without hesitation can pretty solo it, probably even elder level, without help aside from boosting the speed.
---
üëç I‚Äôll probably prime my explosive gat plasma then
---
There‚Äôs only one worthwhile mod on the 50cal anyway, and you can learn it hella easy. Heavy barrel. 
---
Well, prime reciever too, but I‚Äôd save that until you have a really nice gun and can afford to keep it fed
---
You ain't wrong. But should I prime it? I stopped progressing through the story cause of meat week so getting flux myself ain't a thing unless someone does a queen fight or a random nuke
---
Rifleman is so full of suck right now, but an M1 would be cool if rifles were relevant presently.  I used to really love my trusty lever action, but it is gathering dust in my stash since the nerf.
---
No witch hunting! The items duped that were not caught are here, so I suggest ignoring or maybe block and play with people like me or Joe who just pooped out of the vault!
---
That's really frustrating, considering there were crafting sliders in New Vegas. How did they take so many steps forward with 4, yet take several big ones backward as well?
---
Tend to find if you lighten you screen you can pick them up and something nice like a merv frag or telsa rifle. Find they go down like a sack of shit. The dogs are a pain
---
There used to be a named cat just up the hill from the Welch Station in a shack.  Not sure if it is still there.  There are also cats on the sign above NAR Regional, but I'm not positive that they are tameable.
---
There was an incredibly disturbing room... check my recent post
---
disclaimer for weapons that use cores; they wont drop throughout but you get a couple on completion ive been told, so be careful- however ive heard that with the new ammo perks you can create ridiculous amounts of ultracite plasma core in a couple crafts
---
What plat form you on. I have one you can have if your on psn4
---
The best place to revive is at the queen fights.
---
As long as they aren't hurting other people, huh? I guess it makes sense. Just kinda shitty.
---
I foresee zero health and safety issues comrade.
---
Sometimes you just have to give them the benefit of the doubt... it is likely they are a duper but it‚Äôs also possible they traded a rare weapon or outfit at some point to a duper for all of said goods.
---
I'm on PS4, add me (same ID as reddit lol) and I'll let you know when I'm online :)
---
LMG are pretty hard to keep fed w/o priming them.
---
[this will help!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iwnmss/how_to_tame_a_pet_post_patch_22/) Location is VERY important. The map in the post I linked has all the spots!
---
Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs gonna be harder than it could be. One Wasteland didn‚Äôt help.
---
No. Free aim with the handmade.
---
Punk was doing this to me earlier today, it's annoying because if all your crafting benches are close together,  he just goes from one to the other.
---
No. My point was that the game already gives our playstyle so many advantages. Asking for more is biting the hand that feeds you. It's kind of a life philosophy. If you're benefiting fantastically, you don't complain about a tiny insignificant inconvenience.
---
It's a significant boost in both energy and ballistics resistance, but it's not necessary, just saves a few stimpacks. The chest mod, Emergency Protocols is triggered by health below 25% and gives a 50% flat damage reduction for a combined damage reduction of 71% with a full set of PA, I would say that's more important. Very synergistic with a bloodied weapon. 
---
There's a very good reason right now to at least grind the jetpack plan and an arm plan for T-65, but i don't know how much I should say about that.
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at, the market is hurt but it‚Äôs also just a game. I understand though.
---
Just... don't.  
---
It needs to be tameable spawn from a Random Encounter spawn point. It won't make it back to your camp, and if it does it won't last long for a multitude of reasons.
---
It wasn't worth it before One Wasteland, and it *definitely* isn't worth it now. You'll just end up sad and disappointed. It won't be worth it until they make tamed critters un-killable like your camp ally is. And I say that because I know there is *zero* chance they will fix all the bugs that result in a dead or vanished pet.
---
You're better off setting up your camp near a fixed spawn point for cats.
---
That is amazing!
---
big yikes oof, I has cheese for you? üòπ
---
In order for you to tame a pet you need to have animal friend under charisma. Maxed out. Some creatures you need to also have wasteland whisperer. But not for every animal, just certain ones. 
---
Secondly you need to find a creature in a random spawn location. Which you can google where a few places are and you can go there and server hop and hope you find the creature you want. 
---
The creature has to be below your level. I don‚Äôt remember if it needs to be at least half your level or under. 
---
Whenever you go to these random spawn locations, the creature HAS to spawn alone. That means no enemies or other animals nearby. No dead creatures or npc bodies around it. It has to be that creature by itself. No exceptions.  
---
I don‚Äôt think you can tame a cat. I never see them alone when they spawn. And even if you did, whenever your camp gets attacked, your tamed creature tries to defend your camp and attack whatever enemy it is. Your cat will most likely be a level 1 so anything can instantly kill it. And then your pet is gone and you‚Äôll have to go out and get a new one. 
---
There are a few locations you can build your camp that have a cat or cats. However they CAN be killed. And they will run away most of the time when you come close to them.
---
Did you check the container? :P
---
I found one waiting for me at the rusty pick some days ago
---
That sounds neat.
---
If you want to use rifles but still be cowboy like your best bet is the lever action rifle.
---
If by gunslinger you mean pistols, that can work too but I suggest picking one or the other. 
---
You don't have access to every perk, but you also stop gaining stats. And by extension perk slots, at level 50.
---
Nukes and dragons will help you plan this out. But the essentials damage-wise would be rifleman perks, all rank 1 or rank 3 depending on how important that is to you, then bloody mess regardless and adrenaline rank 1. Tank killer is also important. 
---
From there decide whether you want to use stealth, vats, explosives, be tankier, more glass cannon like, or..
---
Edit forgot to finish my post: anything else that you want to fit your theme/goals.
---
What event?
---
(Sorry, I don't pay much attention)
---
Yes, I got that. But, what I've been doing, I go through myself and achieve whatever rank I can. I don't plan on making the Elder Rank. So when I finish, suppose I finish at paladin, I get that roll. Then, go back with a team to make elder, and I get another roll then. 
---
Someone yesterday posted their RNG from making Elder and it was all the same thing, all Troubleshooters weapons and three of the same "rare" plan - I feel like you'd avoid that potential by making those ranks separately instead of depending on making the Elder rank 1 time and rolling once for multiple RNG slots.
---
Surprised they haven‚Äôt implemented pets yet, the community would have a field day with that.
---
Riflemans still works.
---
Just gotta optimize it,  its a pain in the ass and takes work but you can still one shot level 100 supermutants if you want
---
It's all just rng, shouldn't matter how you do it.
---
Well, thanks for your time.
---
If you‚Äôre doing that the runner should just use a ripper/mr handy blade. If your team is doing their job the enemies should only have 1hp and you can just rip through them
---
Like I said, I barely use atoms as it is so having 1500 of them I wouldn't know what to do with. I hardly ever see things in the atomic shop I actually want so they'd just sit there doing nothing and I'd essentially be paying for nothing.
---
I also don't understand your logic in suggesting I pay $100 for something when I've already said $20 is a lot of money for me? Where am I supposed to get $100 from? The monthy sub isn't $15 for me, it's $25. Might not sound like a big difference to to but it is to me.
---
Just build your camp by Murgle. Any cat you can tame is exceptionally rare, will be level 5 and end up dying in under 24 hours most likely.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Murgle
---
..       .--   .-   -.   -       -   ---       -...   .       .-   -.       .   -.--   .   -...   ---   -
---
No need, thanks for the conversation and hopefully things change!
---
Is that because of my build or is it just energy guns not being very effective? Also, how does One Wasteland affect it?
---
Just make sure you stay close so you don‚Äôt get penalized on range damage drop off. Don‚Äôt use it on a flying queen, for instance :P
---
I'm up to level 30 and only do the dailies and what ever I get from getting 10k xp.
---
I'd only buy if its ending and I wanted something bad
---
Yeah they back-pedalled on that pretty majorly. Implemented pet command emotes and everything üòÇ you'd think they'd just slap a quick 'essential npc' tag on tamed critters and call it a day, at the very least.
---
The scrapbox is pretty much the most elusive item for me. I would be stoked to have one with a 1k limit on each item. Crafting is something I always love in games.
---
The cat at Welch is Murgle.
---
This is exactly what I use. Its a Quad Crippling pump shotgun. Holds 32 shots, 1-3 shots for most enemies if using vats.
---
I'd like it to list the date items were added too, so I know if I have something that's been in there too long and isn't moving so I can choose to drop the price or pull it.
---
Yes, her name is Murgle. She hangs around and sunbathes. Great spot for a CAMP.
---
When someone did this to me I was very very happy and confused
---
It loads them 1...by 1....by 1...haha. hitting 0 in a firefight is unfortunate.
---
Yeah, I saw that - I honestly don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs very creepy, just a statement that can describe some people to a T.
---
Ok. Hm, let's test it then. What rare plans/items have you gotten?
---
I drop loot and plans at the Overseer's camp every day.  I always pick that spot because noobs hit it right after leaving the vault.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen high level players go take everything.  It's a major dick move.
---
 That's the one, thanks!  I don't think you can tame Murgles though.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a tamed cat.
---
Yeah I just found it very relatable so hence why I said incredibly disturbing..
---
probably my camp.. ( PS4 LoneMoNK )
---
been fallout 1st subber for a while and had the atoms. the greenhouse set and bos bunker only things i wanted, and as you saw, i like to decorate my camps ( tend to remake/remodel them every other day )
---
think of it as inspiration or getting to see it in game as to rather or not your really want those items
---
I once needed a bunch of purified water for diluting stim packs, first store I found that had any had 30 for free, then 10 or 15 at 3 caps each. I felt bad but I cleaned him out.
---
Simp o matic, the trashy night rifle, the big reactor, the jumpsuit, the stash box, liquid courage.  I think that's it.
---
The damage changes with One Wasteland made a lot of enemies tougher overall (well, it reduced a lot of our potential damage output, and now enemies will generally always be scaled to your level so you can‚Äôt farm lower level, Easy stuff if you‚Äôre having a hard time) so splitting your build focus is going to hurt. Melee also took a disproportionate hit to damage output; combine that with melee‚Äôs hit registration issues due to lag and I really don‚Äôt recommend a melee build right now. 
---
Maybe go all in on your rifles? Lasers actually seem oddly more effective, relatively, to ballistics, with the latest patch.
---
In some places you also have a hard time just finding the meat piles, the best ones are the bright green goo, you can see it from a distance....
---
Hello, thanks for linking this to me.
---
Nerd rage and born survivor are kind of clashing. Power armor has emergency protocols if you want some type of panic ability, but it also has the medicine pump or whatever its called. If you fall below 20% hp you're stronger and tougher but born survivor just heals you out of that buff immediately.
---
Adrenaline 5 aka the difference between a 36% damage buff and a 60% one in your case is coming at the cost of:
---
Fireproof
---
Blocker 
---
Inspirational (that's a 10% xp difference) 
---
If you find the damage is worth it in situations where you thrive significantly more after the buff than before then go for it. I'd sooner recommend choosing whether you want low health to be your jam or not via nerd rage than suggest an adrenaline switch right away.
---
They can‚Äôt just rewrite the lore because people want it to. Liberty prime is sitting under the pentagon, and he will be for another 100+ years
---
Usually these type of problems are caused by local network issues, not necessarily the servers.  Hope you get it sorted out.
---
FFR is sweet. I love my BFFR one. And if you aren‚Äôt spec‚Äôd into explosives, it‚Äôs going to do more damage (hell even spec‚Äôd into explosives, it probably will- the explosion is affected by armor AFAIK)
---
FFR+speedy reciever ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like a really good fire rate. I have an instigating explosive one I primed, and good god it feels so slow compared to my FFR speedy one
---
I put a post up on a trading page to give out reclaimed masks to lower level players for free that can‚Äôt do the event or just couldn‚Äôt get it
---
First guy offered me a bunch of ammo for it because he didn‚Äôt want to take it for free
---
Second guy said he couldn‚Äôt get it so I told him to add me. He popped into the server and added me to team so I dropped the mask and started crafting something. 
---
Exited crafting once I heard footsteps near me to find a level 200+ player (the person who added me) grab the mask off the ground then proceed to join me in ACP
---
keep in mind these are the same exact people that laugh at others posting those items for trade. That really bothered me that day
---
I found a red one that was a strikebreaker or something out in the mire. He recognized me as a general from that one enclave quest and followed me around defending me for awhile until I had to go afk, when I came back we were both dead
---
Legendary, sure. But not speedy reciever (which gives same speed buff as FFR, stacking)
---
So posting about something other than bitching about how "Bethesda sucks", or "Bethesda do this" is me being triggered lol? How about you go back to mommy's basement edgelord, and RP your raider character.
---
Don‚Äôt forget your cowboy outfit...pleasant valley token redemption.....
---
I guess I didn't think of that. That's a fair point.
---
Yeah, it sucks to see that happen. I figure that a certain percentage of the time the stuff will get picked up by a high level player, but sometimes it goes to someone who needs it. I just try not to let them make me get stingy.
---
I keep Rad Ant Lager in my inventory when I'm over encumbered and need a fast travel.  Although there are times that weights (lead farming!) are causing the over encumbered and 50 lbs isn't close to enough to alleviate it.
---
I'm honestly not overly bothered by it either way, however I feel like they should give more food stuffs buffs even if they have multiple things giving the same buffs but balancing it by having one give a large buff for a short time and another a small buff for a long time especially if they remove the Hunger bar
---
So far -between 2 characters - I got the BOS Mask X2, BOS Ops Outfit, Liquid Courage, Super Reactor, Vault 94 Jumpsuit, Vault 94 Stash X2, Solar Panel, War Glaive, The Gutter - and I think that's it.
---
All of those times between those two characters, I've gone through once and then with a team. Usually making elder on the second run through with the team.
---
Wow it really made you "tilted"
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was bad or stupid design. I think ops are fine and will only be getting better,even when it‚Äôs not perfectly tailored to my specific play style.
---
You should be able to heal ghouls with those lol
---
I wasn't aware of that.  Thanks for the tip!
---
Sounds like mommy spent too much time with Mr. Beam during her pregnancy.
---
There should be a subjugator icon later into the lava area of the board
---
... was there a question? A new share?
---
I was gonna say armor ace is more A-Team mixed with GI joe
---
Oh, btw I got the gutter as well.  But it seems to me that they're pretty similar drops.  Nothing crazy out of the ordinary.
---
Well that was my two cents on an event.
---
Stalker melee weapons say hi
---
yeah, its a pain to build a camp that extends into the water there
---
I have my ss armor, four guns fully upgraded, a set of excavator pa upgraded I never use because suddenly it‚Äôs pieces count against my carry weight when I wear it, and I rebuild my camp for fun several times a week. Plus selling steel in bulk, and I still get too much. My camp alone gives me several hundred a day, minimum, because I‚Äôm in the center of a bunch of spawns. I really don‚Äôt need it all.
---
Its fine by its nature, long awaited ,,repeatable content‚Äù but its just weirdly executed. Not bad but weird. Like when u do something but its like good but still its 50% done right.
---
I‚Äôve got 6 perception points. Why? Concentrated fire 1, glow sights 3, and Grenadier 2 (I use explosives, yo!) 
---
4 charisma points. Strange in Numbers, and then whatever appropriate 3star (usually suppressor or tenderizer).
---
My son needed a diaper change and I just started the event so I hopped on the spit and by the time I got back it was done lol perfect actually.
---
Play the game
---
Thanks for the advice. I'd really like to make to both work, because I really love the Power Fist and I'd like to have an alternative so I don't need to rely entirely on one weapon type.
---
If I were to focus on non-automatic energy weapons, what other perks /stats should I focus on?
---
I mean like how zorbo had an icon that would move daily to show roughly how long the season had left in the legendary run. It was fun to race him, especially during the final days.
---
I didn't think those stacked.  I thought only the better buff counted.  Am I wrong?  I could be wrong.
---
I had a camp southwest across the river from wayward, I often had cats just spawn in my camp, that's probably the best you can do
---
Wild Smoked Mirelurk Fillets appears
---
Just use the market bro
---
Yep. Whatever items you build get left there. I‚Äôve claimed many  a built up workshop that someone gave up when they logged off.
---
Does grenadier effect explosive weapons?
---
So the 100% way to beat the glitch is to: as one of the post below said, **"wait" till Ra-Ra moved out first.**
---
So basically, do not make any move, until the little diamond icon disappear from the vent after she entered into the vent. Also, wait for the conversation to finish instead of rushing it through by fast clicking may also helped.
---
**Some hack countering bot glitch**:
---
Bots from the FOUR sliding door cylinder, that one of them not coming out - throw a nade to it, or go near it ,sometime will force it to appear or walk out.
---
The top 2nd floor assualtron won't come out - just get close to the cylinder, if you slap the cylinder you can actually hit through it and damage the assultron! As least a close range weapon worked that way. You may want to turn on damage display for this one.
---
\^ things I found out after I tried pretty much anything I can think of, ha.
---
There‚Äôs nothing specific to energy weapons; just do a rifleman build. Batteries included might be the only difference, for ammo weight, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even worth using. Just watch out for the Grounded mutation!
---
If it's on a private server do they just disappear?
---
thought this was going to be about 50lb account wide mailboxes
---
I was at the location before it started and when it started, I didn‚Äôt join the event. I had to go to the map and select to join the event and go thru the loading screen and all to join.
---
I think people would just prefer if they made more 'badass' 'survivor' esque clothing, of which both the Trailblazer and Merc Outfits qualify for.
---
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs time for me to finally drop Gun-Fu. I didn‚Äôt realize when I took it that the ‚ÄúFU‚Äù part was an acronym.
---
I know this is old now, but I just bought a Dark Matter combat rifle from someone for 300 caps.
---
[https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/ubisubject17/screenshot/19985514](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/ubisubject17/screenshot/19985514)
---
Is the Dark Matter a paint? If so, how can it be sold? I know of no weapon that has paint that can be sold.
---
The last patch rebalanced the difficulty for all player levels, however it seems that it went too far in boosting the difficulty of enemies for lower level players. A hotfix is being released next week which should improve things.
---
I sure hope not, cause that's how I live my life.   I do feel bad  most of the time, but I got to git them levels.
---
I joined a prime event in the Mire today, it was me (lvl 43) and another guy (lvl 412)  one of us had a suppressed sniper with almost 250 rounds, and the other had a .50 cal minigun with what seemed like infinity bullets. 
---
One of us died seven times.  I won't say which one,  I just picked up what was mine and left without making eye contact.  Good times.
---
Been on for awhile....even when I was afk
---
As someone who uses only energy weapons, I wholeheartedly agree. I don't understand why ash and goo piles don't work exactly the same as a meat pile. It's really dumb. It should be like an instant meat pile.
---
Some people seem to really enjoy the feeling of getting over on someone. It doesn't matter what they're winning, so long as someone else is losing.
---
Your specific character could be bugged, or your internet, or their servers. Would need more details.
---
That is a good idea.
---
I‚Äôll try it out
---
Tried it on XBox, got a purple/pink glow on some of the hidden enemies but was inconsistent.   If you've got spare Berry Mentats give it a try, but don't expect it to be as obvious/clear as it is with regular (non stealthed) enemies
---
It really needs hud detection like the power armor helmet.
---
So you just can‚Äôt afford it. I‚Äôve been there. Might I suggest saving the money if you are so tight that a few bucks makes or breaks you. Instead of squeezing your income for extra space for imaginary steel.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm just trying to discover the viability of this if anyone has tried this and knows if it‚Äôs successful or a dud? Really who had tried GRS as melee as well?
---
I'm the opposite, I find I'm hating daily ops, and wish they'd remove them from the score dailies. The rare rewards, if I get one, have all been nothing special. Cage lights, cursed garbage, a gun that's only kinda meh at night and really meh during the day. At least with Earl I got a decent Fixer.
---
I sit on the drums, take a survival syringe at the 57 and 27 marks, and just leave my character there while I muck about with 3D prints. Then I‚Äôve been listing legendary rewards in my CAMP right next door for 0 caps.
---
i noticed this also
---
This is why I locked my Ally in a box
---
I found a quad ammo assaultron head once -- that's one of the "does more damage based on the amount of ammo you load in the chamber" type weapons.  If you took the time to load ALL the ammo it held, each hit was like 3000 damage.
---
Explosive does increase the base damage listed on the weapon when viewed in the pip-boy, even though it's applied as a separate hit. AA does not.  
---
Note: two-shot also increases the damage listed on the weapon (+25%).
---
If mr. Beam is the name of her personal golf instructor, then yeah. I guess maybe she did.
---
I make daily ops teams to do ops, but as well as meet new people and help others out.
---
If anything this would be a BoS item
---
Okat, then! Neat! So far I'm loving my time in Appalachia. I've found a good life as a level 9 refuse cleaner in the meat week event. Haha
---
If we are talking about PA helmet mods, I'd rather take the + to hit chance
---
Not the inspiration and not sure if a wire is supporting it in the image of its some type of floating like hyper loop thing  but the supports are kinda similar. Suspended monorail railways have been around a long time almost as long as railways themselves because they lend them themselves to industrial purposes. The first ideas for them were around at the birth of rail and the first functional one was built in 1825. You can seem remnants of one used in a store in my city for transporting shoes from the 1850‚Äôs in my city.
---
No, it won‚Äôt just animate 8. I use a quad lever action. You reload every round.
---
PA with Emergency Protocols is what I use. As long as I maintain enough Rads, Born Survivor doesn‚Äôt take me over 20%.
---
There is an issue with it I‚Äôm finding in more serious fights like SBQ and Colossus where if I do go down I‚Äôm coming back missing some of my rads so I am likely going to drop it.
---
It was just nice having an auto because this game lags so bad sometimes.
---
I could bring Adrenaline down some but I‚Äôm not sure that I would put the points in Blocker or Fireproof.
---
My biggest problems have all been due to lag in game from a bunch of shit going on at once. So sometimes when I hit the D-pad for a stim it isn‚Äôt registering.
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to think on this.
---
No problem. I'm glad it helped you out. üëç
---
This community is actually awesome. Had a level 140 drop 30 stimpaks on me. Felt bad, because I wasn't there to mooch.
---
I will do this then. My goal with this character is to be helpful at any level.
---
The l is a elevated normal tracks, Disney has a elevated monorail, then you have a monorail suspended and elevated from the tracks like fallout 76 and other places since 1825. Then this magic thing that gets shot through loops using magnets and no supports maybe wires
---
I genuinely don't know wtf neat week is
---
Me, every time. I‚Äôve been in the ash heap for almost a week and I feel like something is wrong. I‚Äôm always ‚Äòjust checking‚Äô if I could put a camp down,because that building would be sweet to use, etc.
---
The true end game. Real estate hunting.
---
It's an awesome cosmetic item with a handy flashlight. Pricing it like that is very scammy though as I've seen people getting tricked into buying it as their first SS plan. If only plans were more discriptive or let you inspect the items you learn from them.
---
Never run to the quest I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt understand it did the killing quest twice even though I killed a lot never had prime meat on any kills, did the quest with graham lol in 30 seconds it said I failed 
---
I do a lot of grinding I‚Äôm 3/4 of the way though legendary quest but I skip all the meat quest
---
Why are you so against the idea of making an accomodation for people on a lower income that will affect you in no way whatsoever?
---
Why? Arguably the best modern fallout came from them.
---
Buy all the plans, particularly the serum plans.   Do all the atom challenges that are under the other categories besides the daily/weekly score challenges.   Get all the tadpole and possum badges.  And if you want a really long-term goal:   get to level 300, keep going, and max out all the legendary perks.
---
The people who think this game is good are delusional.
---
Upvoting this post is like petting a puppy
---
Lower income then my 0? Shit, how are you earning negative when my crippled ass at least breaks even?
---
I was suggesting that if your money is so tight to save it rather then squeeze an extra dime out for game benefits. But not everything can be shaved down so we broke ass fucks can dig the cost out of the sofa.
---
*Laughs in Liberty Prime
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!!!!
---
You mean somewhere for high levels to dump trash for low levels to pick through? Isn‚Äôt that containers in train stations?
---
Since they removed stealth from ops and events, bloodied pa heavy gunner. Plus stealth / rifle hasn't had gear added since patch 8, and vats is still broken.
---
I see so its best to stick to the default excavator as its easier to get and carries so much more.
---
For fucks sake can they fix the crashing issues?
---
I've been fucked out of caps and ammo on Imposter Sheepsquatch in all of the attempts but one because the game can't handle the sheer amount of effects happening. Not to mention losing all of the legendaries from the trash mobs that disappear.
---
Seriously, this game is already stingy as fuck when it comes to getting halfway decent legendaries the least you could do is give scrip for killing legendary enemies or something. Then maybe it wouldn't be so damn frustrating.
---
sounds like a good location to drop nukes on
---
I really recommend using PA. Been playing a Heavy Gun PA build a few months ago. And as full health you can use a jet pack instead of protocols. Or if you are bloodied I think in PA with protocols your taking ~71% damage? Cant remember if thats with or without Nerd rage.
---
I don't think the 10mm smg has a quad version.
---
At first I thought this was a recommendation for a great card to pick up and I nearly wept.
---
It would be cool to have a level 200 kitty at my camp tearing the head of my enemies off. Well, one can dream...
---
Seriously. Make them like allies. You tame it, get a item to build for it, you can switch them like allies. There, fixed with a system already in place, minimal work.
---
Block from session....easy fix.  I‚Äôll take 1000 caps....or whatever aluminum you can spare....I always run out....
---
Don't worry, more power armor target dummies are on their way to Appalachia
---
Hell yeah. Me too. I love rolling out in my western gear with chaps, black cowboy hat, lever action and 6 shooter.  This is one of my favorite parts of the game. Every few days I'll put together a different outfit and weapon load out with my own back story.  It's just something that makes the game a bit more fun for me. I love coming back to the cowboy though.Have fun out there.
---
I strongly suggest a crit vats rifleman build and using a lever action. Just square up and pop every head.
---
I like these. I've noticed the blue suitcase at Whitespring Station has become more popular recently - half the time I go to drop known plans in there and I find a whole bunch already in there.
---
I think you still don‚Äôt have to start, due to the several double score weekends.
---
I‚Äôm heading to bed. I‚Äôll look for you in morning
---
Well, cheating is quite common in the Wasteland, even by machines it seems.
---
Coming from a player who afks while cooking / drums ( I have all the plans I‚Äôm farming them and giving dupes to my clan mates ) I hate the people that do what your saying. And I think the nuka mine can actualy kill them. They can even kill players that afk drums and cook. But those are the players that finish the event fast. With 6 people AFK you will auto finish the event in under 20 - 25 seconds
---
I mean I did, but these kinds of assholes have been popping up more frequently.
---
I'm currently trying to find a none bloodied alternative gun to do those a bit easier since I can't sneak lol
---
Looks good, i'll be interested in seeing the build.
---
I only watched the first minute or two of your video, and if there's one thing i'd suggest is increasing your volume a bit, your video was so much quieter than any other content I watch that I had to literally triple my volume to hear you xD
---
im surprised by this cause the exp is insane at those events, it's also some of the most fun in the game in my opinion. I've had times where i start to fight the main enemies then all of a sudden 3 different types show up and it becomes a exp orgy. the event in cranberry bog while fighting fog crawlies had a hermit crab, yaos and a behemoth show up once before the final wave. those things are crazy exp
---
but you can't have both high capacity and grocer at the same time
---
Oh and I forgot Th is only works if the people are allready playing or cooking pre event. You get points before the event even start for playing drums or cooking. So 6 ppl afk with pre event points the event is done in under 25 seconds
---
Yeah, I'll fix that in the future. I'd recommend watching what's at 6 minutes.
---
I enjoyed it almost as much as 3 and about the same as 4.I think people overrate it though.
---
This game can be quite realistic sometimes (getting nothing for a lot of effort)...
---
ED-E would be niiice.
---
Collect all tadpole and possum badges.!!
---
Collect a good number the purified Flux to build things that need Flux
---
Do sub quests
---
Read terminals and notes
---
Collect perk cards
---
....
---
I wish I could use robotics expert + wasteland whisperer/animal friend combo "to tame" him and to send him to my camp. If only sentry bots could appear at random static encounters, not roaming ones so I could test it
---
I meant lower income as a general term not lower than your particular income as I obviously have no way of knowing your personal income.
---
In my opinion, New Vegas isn't even remotely the best. It's overhyped by fanatic fanboys and doesn't live up to its reputation, same as Outer Worlds for example. In fact, if I had to rate all the Fallout titles, NV wouldn't be far from the bottom.
---
You can tame a cat (or a dog) at the usual random encounter locations, but they are very rare and so low level it's pointless. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Bubble turret? A turret that shoots bubbles?
---
It‚Äôs vague for a reason.....
---
It drives player travel to fellow campers and encourages interaction.  And....this isn‚Äôt Amazon, it‚Äôs a nuclear wasteland.
---
They are just back for the new stuff they will fade out again quickly
---
Huh. Everyone‚Äôs preference. I liked it because it reminded me a bit more of the originals, and their ancestor wasteland.
---
Yea especially doing colossal problem or scorched earth when it says waiting for response from server and then the game be like ‚Äúnah homie gtfo of the server‚Äù
---
I have the exact opposite problem - I can never get to the cook on time because I'm always in the middle of something else, and people finish it in 3-4 minutes
---
Dun duh-duh Dun, duh
---
Dun-dun-dun-duh-duh-duh
---
It's stuck in my head worse than the fasnacht music lol
---
Just skipped to there, that was amusing, the scorchbeasts and the cowardly mirelurk queen were good.
---
Really wish there was a jaw harp there too
---
Canned dog food, dandy boy apples, Salisbury steak, Blanca Mac n cheese, fancy lad cakes, Cajun rice and beans, cram, cotton candy bites, funnel cake, imitation seafood, Insta mash, potato crisps, sugar bombs, yum yum devilled eggs.
---
These are all prewar packaged foods so it kinda makes sense.
---
Also you can get variants that don‚Äôt have rads for 5 of them (I think) by manufacturing them at the workshop direct west from flat woods. Think the place is called sunshine meadows .....
---
I took it down. Im going to reupload it with fixed audio.
---
Me too. They were pissed at me.
---
There are many npcs scattered across the map.Areas near cliffs and mountains with a single npc mining or digging.Plenty of npcs along rivers as well.Some of them are close enough together you could probably plop a base down between them and have 2.
---
There are...... Ways
---
I‚Äôve never even seen a rper,let alone a toxic one. I can‚Äôt even find bases that look like part of the world. Or like they care about physics.
---
I thought that there were other Craftable ones as well like some of the teas and soups, but I may be mistaken?
---
Funny how that guy was actually describing himself. To be fair though, there needs to be more indication in-game of what exactly should be done.
---
Gotchu gotchu
---
Alright, thank you so much!
---
Sounds like you need a better gun/build....
---
About level 30, plenty of time left. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My commando character use vampire weapon in daily ops, trouble in Resilient mutation only
---
There's always the 'rock out' emote where you pose with a guitar and mic. Looks pretty good in pictures in my opinion.
---
I don't think anything craftable makes the list unfortunately.
---
Just whack some power armour on x-01 here and it to me handles the damage fine enough no mods on it. Just keep a finger near stims. More the special abilities of mobs that was annoying like freeze for eg.
---
It‚Äôs called me sucking ass at aiming and bloodied being nerfed straight into the graveyard. still usable tho
---
I use my stealth rifleman during ops no prob
---
I have been using an auto Tesla rifle with the vampire effect and it works like a charm. No really need to change your build fully just find an alternate weapon that blitzes through the enemies.
---
Your welcome
---
You do realize Graham pretty much spend the entire time telling people what to do right?
---
Finally. A good quality post not asking for new atom shop items or emotes.
---
Oye I hate power armor lol
---
I figure I'll take batteries included for my main combat loadout just for convenience sake. It would probably be more optimal to put more points into grenade damage or something. Aside from the Rifleman perks, how else can I make laser rifles more effective? Should I be putting more points into Luck for more critical hits?
---
It's not the best but most recent.
---
However as for stacking, you can't stack 2 carry weight bonuses but you can stack one carry weight &amp; one strength one, with strength giving extra carry weight bonus, just like the whisky.
---
On top of the hill overlooking the northern exit from Huntersville. There's a lead deposit in there
---
Yeah it works but I‚Äôm thinking bolstering might help
---
Honestly don‚Äôt sweat it, I think you can miss 2 entire weeks worth of challenges this season and still make it. Last season I didn‚Äôt even do all those stacks for xp gain and finished pretty early.
---
Yeah vampire seems legit.
---
I just go in bloodied with total randoms and I always got elder first try... 
---
The only rough (ish) combination is robots who needs to be killed by melee, the rest is a walk in the park with some perks switching.
---
Keep a locked door with a garage door infring of it with the switch for it hidden and then message a lower level offering free loot
---
I think players like need more visual indication as that usually helps in other events with tasks.
---
Then heavy combat armour, marine, scout, secret service armour should get that DR stats up.
---
Yeah seems crazy since I run a prime B2525 Fixer but maybe vampire
---
I can see the resining but this could lead to dangerous territory overall.The community was rather split on first when it came out and still are.Tempting Bethesda with multiple paid tier systems might be a Pandora‚Äôs box situation.
---
They're call train stations
---
Yeah seems maybe vampire
---
What quest lines are you running? Are you staying in the forest? You should be able to run the OG story and the overseers missions and tap out at about lvl 30.  If you are looking to grind XP, daily ops is definitely the way to go.  I would suggest a melee build....grognak axe or supersledge...and a bow with a damage mod.  Mod everything out as much as you can.  If you need a set of armor or weapons made...I‚Äôm on Xbox and can help set you up for a better run at lvl 50
---
I run Bloodied, so I'm familiar with emergency protocols. Helps make up for no Serendipity. But since the damage rework I'm wondering if bloodied is still worth it 
---
And for the last bit, I think I know what you're saying, thank you
---
Yeah it works. Always hunting for best solutions.
---
i‚Äôve been running into a lot of dicks recently.  had a dude just watch me call for help looking at me then take my junk after. 
---
tons of ppl rushing and killing everything in front of everyone
---
Swap perks for ricochet in Luck and dodgy in Agility. If you‚Äôre bloodied get serendipity too.
---
Works fine for me, occasionally need a stimpak. Only the robots post a larger threat, then you‚Äôre better off with some troubleshooter armor. You could also pair with vampire weapons for survival.
---
That's a good point.  I wasn't thinking carry weight vs strength.  It makes sense that those stack since they're technically separate bonuses.
---
I got disconnected 3 times yesterday in about 30 minutes, rebooted my PS4 didn‚Äôt happen again
---
Thinking that or AA, not sure yet though.
---
One of those bubble shaped turrets that place on walls and ceilings.
---
That... God yes.
---
You have passed the test young padawan.
---
Just go full commando and own them with your fire power, no sneak is totally fine.
---
Pretty much
---
I soloed that event by mistake. Lots of running for my life. Had a 3 star sbq in it as well just to make it interesting. Most fun ive had in game for a long time. 2 levels in just that fight as i was bonded in a group of 4 that never showed up. Unfortunately I relocated my camp by accident during the fight. Spent hours rebuilding it. I build unique buildings so its time consuming. Still have gone from 122 to 150 during the week so far.
---
Right? I'm excited about it. Lol.
---
Yeah serendipity of course. Dodgy and ricochet could help.
---
Been happening to me for four hours in a row despite server hopping. Asia/pacific on Xbox
---
Yeah that is some asshole shit right there.
---
You obviously do not understand what the word "I spired" means.
---
My sneak commando just shoots them in the face now, I don‚Äôt bother changing perks or gear
---
Could be perk arrangement too.
---
Pretty sure nothing stopped Beth from bringing new vegas content to fo76 before the acquisition.
---
Lol
---
Dude that is totally fkd up man.that is a straight dickhead move.wow.
---
This is 100% inspired by Space Invaders.
---
If I remember correctly the honey crisp, blackberry honey crisp and fasnacht doughnut don‚Äôt spoil (but are a pain to craft)
---
The only things I bother picking up when someone else drops are plans I don't already know.
---
just buy a cheap 15% block armor. Both will become magic
---
The one by top of the world has tons of loot laying out from previous battles too. Tons of gold and acid for the taking.
---
Are you dying a lot?
---
I use a full unyielding ss armor (dense on chest), blocker rank 3, serendipity rank 3, fireproof rank 3 (must have for explosive ones obvs) and I think I died once to the final assaultron because time was running out and I went like full berserk on it from a meter away... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I also use herbivore with about 10 different food bonuses and rejuvenated, that does help too...
---
im someone who fixes everything that i need fixed my self, but there have been a few times in my life where i had more $ then time ( working 12 hr shifts 5 days a week for months on end ). so i hired someone to fix something for me. 
---
this may be what has happened, someone with more $ then the time to put in to earning the rewards
---
Wat
---
Certain types of weapons are still insane. I find a bloodied railway rifle to be a one shot king. My bloodied handmade uses more ammo, but the increased ammo production of an alt with Ammo factory makes up for it. 
---
My Bloodied Plasma Rifle with a flamer barrel is the most insane damage now. I'm getting 250 to 300 damage per tick on all parts of an enemy. 300 round magazine equals up to 90,000 damage between reloads. DPS is close to a magic weapon without being one meaning it might get skipped by any upcoming patches.
---
Is this still available? My PSN is Vault-tec_commie
---
This has secretly been reposted a handful of times!!
---
Bulk junk from vendors and rarely players. Bought around 50 bulk packs from some guy last week following him screaming "I'm rich! I'm rich!" over the microphone. Made me smile
---
What?
---
People are dumb, no surprise.
---
31 today
---
Yup that‚Äôs the set up. No not dying a lot. Even as a bloodied build I never want to die once lol
---
It's an item that won't satisfy nearly as much hunger you spend on getting it. Quite worthless actually and has only a meme value.
---
Fun fact: a level 2 character with a melee weapon can 1-shot the resilient robots with a throwing knife.
---
Source: made a new character to try out daily ops to test enemy scaling. Then again you get murdered pretty quick as a level 2. Oddly enough the blood eagles are way tankier than mutants or robots at level 2, and half the time the hounds spawn at level 15.
---
When I made that comment we still got 1 coin per card rank and not 2, so I re-did my calculations.
---
You need to be lvl 787 to max out 6 legendary cards assuming you finish your regular build at lvl 50 and don't respec after that. That's without taking perk card packs earned through other ways than leveling up 5 lvls after reaching lvl 50. So in reality you should be able to reach 6 maxed cards before lvl 787.
---
Also if you only rank up your cards to rank 3 first, you'd "only" need to reach lvl 550. 
---
If you ask me these numbers are way beter than what it was like at first. These legendary perks are something you should have to work towards to fully max out and not just have them completely finished shortly after unlocking them.
---
Atleast leveling up means something again for high lvls now. Before this update I was sitting on almost 150 lvl ups because they were useless once you completed your build.
---
The only thing that I'd want to see changed is an option to turn a lvl up directly into 2 perk coins and cut out the middle man so to say.
---
Wow - what an arrogant and very ignorant thing for him to say.
---
Could be, I don't think I ever crafted those... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Haven't had the event skip altogether, but I have had Grahm not show up. Usually it's because he's wandered off somewhere. Use your compass to scan around for white dots nearby, you'll often find him hiding behind a tree or something.
---
Yeah I see so many people kill critters and NOT pick up and deposit the remains. I mean, they are so easy to kill did they really think that's all they have to do?
---
Didn‚Äôt I just see this earlier? This YT decide spam was the best way to advertise?
---
Pretty sure everything you craft spoils.
---
Never seen a RPer.... how does someone roleplay anyways?
---
You could counter any melee pests with Marsupial mutation + Strange in Numbers while in a public team. Worth the base -4 to INT downside for sure.
---
Actually what happened was that the audio was messed up so I took the video down and fixed the audio within minutes of posting it. I reposted this after uploading the fixed version. So there is no spamming going on. üëç
---
I vampire tank ops. Just sit there and keep enemy at Bay.
---
Well, if you don't die you don't need more defense. üòä
---
There's not many craftable ones. Lemonade for drinks, and Fasnacht donuts for food, and maybe a couple of others I'm forgetting.
---
Makes it a real pain to rp and run any sort of cafe vendor or anything like that.
---
You can put stuff on shelves using the same technique. I have all my shelves in my main full of items. May have to use the rug to stack em high enough to do it in one go. Takes a bit a practice and patience but makes for a unique camp.
---
Smort!
---
Ah okay. I knew I‚Äôd seen it,haha. Makes sense.
---
No hard feelings, spam is bad for the sub. üëç
---
*loads gun*
---
Lame!  that was one of the best events they've done so far.
---
One of the great things about Meat Week is that there are loads of animals that drop acid at the events.
---
And the goo piles covering the ash piles!
---
Emergency Protocols: Increases speed by 25% and reduces damage received by 50% when health is below 20%

It's a player vendor bug which was reintroduced with patch 22. Your vendors will randomly post your stash items for sale at random prices, even items that normally can't be sold (bullion weapons &amp; armor, skinned items, non-droppable event rewards, etc). I shutdown my vendors until it's fixed - had it happen to my Father Winter Helmet (Power Armor rare Fasnacht event reward), which you can't drop, sell or trade normally, so I know from first hand experience it's true.
---
I've tried switching to bolstering, robots are your biggest enemies.
---
Swing speed Yes!.. troubleshooters Ouch
---
49 you level up alot easier now.
---
Agreed. Didn‚Äôt know it got buffed, the blaster. Maybe I‚Äôll check it out and pull it from display.
---
No u don‚Äôt. If u use drums and spits in the two minute countdown and then actually do the event it‚Äôs done in under a minute. Being on the drums doesn‚Äôt fill the bar as quickly as it depletes
---
Sorry to reply to an old thread and comment but since the question was already here saves me asking about joining the PTS. But I did have a few questions.  
---
So if I own the game on steam there is no way to join the PTS?  
---
And if I now buy the game on the Bethesda Launcher, Does my character from steam carry over to the Bethesda Launcher game? Or am I starting all over again?
---
Reposted it this 1 time because I took the video down and fixed the audio so the link changed. üëç
---
So basically populate mama dolce's? Since it's a undercover communist center
---
I die once or twice but I want to die zero. Lol
---
You have to dedicate everything to damage and have basically no quality of life perks to use it.
---
Bolstering didn‚Äôt help?
---
Ya
---
Yeah, this has been asked for a lot lol.
---
We can all live in hope, but I highly doubt they‚Äôll actually implement something like this now.
---
I've load 500 rounds into my explosive double barrel shotgun b4... It was fking awesome and funny!! üòÇ
---
Definitely buying that 1 cap 40mm grenade. üëç
---
The people on drums and spits keep the bar froM depleting, you need people doing drums/spits as much as you need the rest
---
Would not be upset at all.I think it gives a good balance to the game.You have to set aside some weight for food and drinks.It gives a reason to acquire recipes,farm ingredients and craft.Without the drawback of hunger and thirst it takes away more from the game than people think.
---
So many other things they could be adjusting or fixing and they chose this.
---
Not really for me, especially when robots hits much harder... I find it better to keep your health above 30%, otherwise they will still just one or two hit you...
---
If they are just circling, you can literally ‚Äúbump‚Äù them continuously and push them out. That was a great source of joy during the Fastnacht event :)
---
Is that rare or something? I've seen it pop once, nobody came and I was too low before they one wastelander.
---
Yep, first thing I su usually is go for remains, chally‚Äôs poo, greens and fires then jump on drums
---
I only wish more people AFK‚Äôd the event like this.
---
Yeah, I mentioned this the last time someone whined about the radtoads. It literally says in one of the loading screens that the radtoad sends out its offspring as decoys. Your VATS is supposed to target it.
---
Funny how posts like these just prove that it works.
---
We really, really need a full revamp of armor and weapon perks. It‚Äôs not good when 80% of weapons are just useless out of the gate.
---
Does toxic goo count as food or Chen's? Or maybe neither? I ain't carrying it around otherwise, way too heavy
---
I don't really frequent this sub for the same reason. Nothing but reposts because they couldn't be bothered to do a quick search.. or whining about the most miniscule bug and demanding/tagging a dev fix it right away.
---
Thats where I normally offload plans, ammo and chems when I get too many as it's the closest train station to my camp. It also gets a lot of foot traffic so I never have to worry about it not getting found. With all the Spec Ops runs and meat week I've been dumping stuff daily including some junk legendaries that I don't any stash space available for...
---
Needs a Subjugator photo mode pose, with him doing the claw gesture.
---
No. You don‚Äôt. I did the whole first meat week and now this one. U can load the drums. Do nothing else and the bar drops still. You‚Äôre far more helpful and effective collecting critter it‚Äôs and cleaning up the the site.
---
Got an AA explosive handmade. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs the new meta. In fact, with one wasteland, is basically the equivalent of what TSE was at launch.
---
Interesting, that is good to know.
---
Yeah, but not the type of picture i was going for.
---
Like others have stated - keep the unyielding gear, put dodgy and ricochet in addition to serendipity. And use a vampire weapon (I use a tesla on my commando). I've solo'd it several times already like that.
---
Yeah seems like just some perk shifting rather than armor swap.
---
Yeah ty that seems to be the consensus.
---
You can find a dead body with a note called ‚ÄúPipe...‚Äù and all it says is ‚ÄúPipe is life!‚Äù

There is also a pipe coming out of the ground you can approach, with the option to ‚ÄúSniff‚Äù as the activation. It makes your screen go crazy for a bit, implying you got some sort of high from it. That‚Äôs all there is to it, as far as I know. I never found it, but my wife did and I saw a bit of it on her screen.
---
Ya, screw those guys.  I keep dying at Meet Weak and didn't get a Tendrizer./s
---
I never saw a Afk for now, but if I ever meet one, be sure I'm gonna kill him.
---
This. It came out when the game was released. I still use mine!
---
It‚Äôs the limited-time Grahm‚Äôs Meat Cook, which is just southwest of Vault 76...
---
Honestly I want to believe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not understanding‚Äîsome master plan‚Äîbut the only reasons I can come up with for this are pretty cynical.
---
Oh my gosh, I'm jealous! My boyfriend and I want to do a fallout 76 tour of west Virginia so bad!
---
this is why you dont put a large number of the same thing in your vendor. ppl will think the worst no matter what, i had a lot of mags, heads and meds saved up from the time when i couldn't put my vendors up due to paranoia about the "ppl can take things from your vendor for free " bug. 
---
but i had to list them no more then 10 at a time, 50 for meds, and not even numbers because "omg someone **may** have done something wrong and i have to report them!" 
---
i bought my nephew an account, and he has been going to meat week with me, he named his account after mine, and now every time we are at the same place he gets harassed because omg there are 2 ppl here with account names that are kinda close to being the same 
---
im sure he or i have been reported a few times for ... having account names that are close to each other ... i dont remember that being in the rules, a hour ago after meat week event my nephew went back to his house he built near the event and logged out.. and i hear ppl saying "omg he has a name close to this other persons name and he  went in his house and blocked off the door hes duping! and he logged out when i said something about him! "
---
ya he went to work calm down lol
---
Downvote all you like. You might as well AFK daily Ops for all the use you are in event. I agree it‚Äôs not arrogant or ignorant as you seem to know exactly how the event works. It‚Äôs lazy and selfish
---
If you‚Äôre getting hit hard at 21% or higher for more than your remaining hp, you‚Äôll die without the damage mitigation proccing. If you‚Äôre squishier than usual, try unslotting some of your perk cards and then re-equipping them. There‚Äôs some sort of bug where your perk cards stop working (possibly one log-in) and they need to be re-applied to work. As far as I know, Protocols still works as intended, even though the Effects tab only lists the speed buff as the effect (which, by the way, doesn‚Äôt stack with the Speed Demon mutation).  
---
That‚Äôs my best guess, without having an intimate knowledge of your build or what situations you‚Äôre dying in.
---
Explosive effect adds an explosion equal to 20% of your weapons damage and the game shows the total number on weapon card.
---
As for you buying it... It's a player vendor bug. It can randomly post items from your stash, even stuff you normally can't sell or drop... Someone was very upset when they got that sale notification after you bought their item üòâ That AAE Fixer is a top tier weapon.
---
I actually got two accounts with another heavy char on my second one with only lvl2 PA reboot i could test on. First of all i got it working with lvl4 on my bloodied main now. I didn't rly find any perk that would block it in my tests. 
---
But first of all, it only starts to get a bit reliable from lvl3 on. It is hard to make it work on a bloodied build. Because a hard enough hit at  (let's say) 10HP from a big enemy can send you over the edge easily while small hits that drain those last few health points slower make it proc more often. So with a higher dmg resistance (especially with lvl3 adamantium skeletton inbound) its working much better. At least for me.
---
Sure, but if the bar doesn‚Äôt starts at 75% because there was NOBODY on the drums/spits, you need everybody to do their part
---
Nope, not just you.   Our crew tried out a Foosball table at a camp and experienced the same problem.  It followed us around the map.
---
I could have sworn I just seen this post with a different title like an hour ago..
---
Hopefully we get unique gear from daily ops in the next big update. Get one token and exchange it to a special vendor for one out of 3 possible random pieces of gear at the end of an Elder completion. These pieces of gear can be 3 random 3-star legendary weapons or armor and you pick what you want. This will give us the benefit of choice, flexibility in building our character, a reason to keep doing them, and throw away the stale grind. Something like Destiny's weekly special vendor, but make it daily with random 3-star items.
---
I got the Symptomatic in my first week and it gave me one less reason to keep doing Daily Ops. Not sure how long it will last til more events come in, but I'm going through the new content quite quickly. The above idea would do wonders as having a random choice in 3-star gear would make things interesting for a long time, trying out new things that I chose and not have a few good days in the middle of bad ones.
---
I saw a few when the game first launched but it has been a long time since.Never really understood why people even tried to Rp in video games in general let alone in one that does not have dedicated servers for it.If I wanted to rp online I would go find a community site that actually emphasizes it.

Charli Nuke Code? Is that a nuke code that bombs charli's house?

---
I mean, technically it's broad enough to cover it, but they're pretty unlikely to enforce that.
---
Right. But your not being abused because your on the drums or spits in the build up. It‚Äôs because u stay on them not helping and being selfish. So that‚Äôs not an argument.
---
Combat probably But  I think you should run both The TSE for most things and the AAE  For anything with armor. I am a commando I run a Tse handmade and a AAE comdat rifle
---
Hasn‚Äôt happened to me this meat week but has in the past a few times.
---
I nuke my camp every once in a while ( store the expensive stuf first of course) and then repair it all so it will be at 100%.
---
I was sad the pvp anyone bug wasn't working for two assholes who just stood next to the drums the whole time while the event failed because only two of us were engaged in it at all.
---
Does the magic affix need to be in the second position? I got a quad ffr 33vats, and I have a piece of armor with the 15 block, so it should melt everything, but it does like 5 damage per pellet IF it hits, which it rarely does. I'm beginning to think it's a cursed shotgun.
---
Had it happen to me just now. So frustrating. How can stuff like this not be fixed as fast as the beneficial glitches do.
---
I get your point...that bug you mentioned explains a couple runs too. 
---
I know the vets are tired of it, I just started in August, so this is only the second time I've seen meat week, but I can see how the high levels might be bored of it.
---
80% of the time I get nothing, even with Elder. Today again. The game says ‚Äò80% chance to get rare rewards‚Äô, it‚Äôs meant to be a joke. The rare reward is called ‚ÄòNone‚Äô.
---
They just delayed the next content dump, so not for a bit?
---
 Not really, if I see people In the drums I go and clean up, if I see nobody doing that part of the event I jump in them, because again, there needs to be someone in there, especially if nobody worked them before the event, so nope, neither lazy nor selfish my dude
---
Your best bet for an inexpensive way to play is with Game Pass.
---
This right here. Its a designer purse of a helmet. Does it do anything special? No. But it does show you have currency to spare
---
.08 per second progress for each drum played. Bonus .08 if all 3 played.  Same for spits.
---
I wish if i could. But i dont belive they will release such feature just for free. Its same category as stash box. You want more storage but FF, you want more camp size buy FF.
---
What the fuck is the agility on that build haha
---
Stamina bar full basically 100% of the time
---
Weird that they added the Gutter. I was about to put the one in my stashbox in my vendor, seems like the same weapon with a new skin.
---
Don't listen to him OP, he's got his stupid helmet on.
---
No. Again it doesn‚Äôt need to be done at all. Kill critters collect plants. Nobody needs to go anywhere near a drum or spot once the event starts. Almost every event I do is under 2 minutes and almost every one has nobody being a dick on the drums
---
Yep, this.
---
The way it pronounces nuclear is a reference to dubya
---
Ahhh dang that sucks
---
Happened to me a week or so ago but seemed to be ok after that one time.
---
I‚Äôm kinda weird and I like everything to be on steam so idk about getting that
---
 If you read the patch notes you‚Äôll see that that‚Äôs part of the update.
---
You missed it. 6 on the drums and spits and the event is over in maybe a minute.  If it happens server hop and try for another.
---
Was there at 5 of and was on the barrel drum, so it wasn‚Äôt that.
---
And again. 2 minutes. Nobody near a drum or spit. Help don‚Äôt hinder
---
Thanks I was just confused because I thought it meant like things would be closer to my level, not that everything is my level. Theres no diversity so I thought it was weird üòÖ
---
Ahh ok. Hopefully they‚Äôll see this and fix the issue. Wish they caught this before they started the second season.
---
Drumming before the event is important, during the event, depending on how many players, it's really lazy.
---
Well, I wouldn‚Äôt go for any stealth since they can‚Äôt be silenced. But VATS is pretty badass- concentrated fire, gun fu, and yeah, there‚Äôs a ton of Luck VATS perks to play with. Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint can be very handy if you really get in to vats- instant AP restore!
---
Pa is definitely still tankier over all, but I would appreciate legendary versions.  EA helped a lot and poison resistance did too.
---
The drums/spits works while 'preparing' for the meat cook.  After 2 min. go pick greens and turn them in.  Done.  If fast enough, try to hop servers for a 2nd chance.
---
When you first start the game at the main menu, look at the xp bar. If it says you're at level 1 open the scoreboard before you even load into a server.
---
This is what I have been doing. Its almost embarrassingly easy, at least against Blood Eagles. Might be slightly less useful with Robots and Super mutants unless you have quad variant.
---
PA is tankier in its vanilla form but if you stack perks and sentinel, power armor will lose.
---
I tried out my foosball table and the sound didn't stop until I logged out. Not touching that thing again.
---
well cause you time out on the activities after less than an hour but yeah. why would you want to bump them? they're not hurting you.
---
A companion mobile app would really be nice for this game - so many good community recommendations could fit really well into an app that extends basic game features while making them available 24x7 and available to the entire community vs the handful of people you are playing on the same server at the same time with. 
---
Really wish we could find the right person to speak with :/ this is right up our ally and we are in pretty close proximity of some of their offices.
---
I got esports interns hungry to learn a little development and build anything for the gaming industry, and the right team to put behind it all to make it happen.
---
And if anyone from Bethesda is reading this and not interested .... at least come on our damn radio show! Our listeners would love to hear from you. We will throw you softball questions. Pre-recorded and safe for air. Just saying! :)
---
Again, I was there way before the event would have began. It starts on the hour and I was there a good 7-8 mins just sitting on a barre drum waiting for the event to begin.
---
It never started. No map logo, no timer, no nothing. Grahm also happened to be utterly MIA. I‚Äôve had times before where I found him on the edge of the area but I checked all over. He was straight up missing.
---
I‚Äôve had the event finish within a min or two after the 2 min countdown before so I know what you‚Äôre talking about. Thats not what this was. The event did not occur. It just didn‚Äôt.
---
Those quest lines weren't designed for enemies to level up with you. It's a big problem.
---
I am selling a tonne of ammo now.
---
happened to me yesterday. i was doing my thing around watoga waiting for the pop up. on the hour i checked the map and could see 3 or 4 people up there. 
---
1 minute past and nothing. 2 mins past. nothing. Either the event happened and there was no alert on the screen and the icon didnt appear on the map or it didn't happen at all
---
No i mean the event itself never started on three server hops nothing going on @ 3am EST
---
lol Weird how you're being downvoted when it's true. Had a few times when one guy wouldn't join at all, no matter how much we spammed the come here emote.
---
Sometimes the opposite happens. I made a Casual team with a friend and this dude joins and starts spamming the come here emote after joining a Daily Ops. We were doing an Event and this dude just wants to hijack the team before asking us if we wanted to do a Daily Ops.
---
Now, I just create my own Daily Ops team after getting ready. It's a struggle getting people to go in and if I'm leader, I'll kick and make room for those who wants to keep doing them. I'll switch to Casual right away after I'm done to alert everyone I'm done doing them. It's that simple. 
---
Hope to see updates with how it works. I believe when the leader joins an Op, there should be an automatic countdown of 15 to 30 seconds to transport everyone in. Also a Daily Ops emote should be added in for warnings where others can reply with an thumbsup or thumbsdown emote.
---
Great. Awesome. My vendors are still at full stock. I have every round selling for 1 cap each
---
Seriously? I have sold no less than 40k 5.56 and a tonne of random ammo through the vendor since Monday. Takes longer but never fails to sell for me
---
Then bide your time till your next whale approaches.
---
don't feel bad, high levels are usually lugging around too much crap anyways, especially with the meat week hootenanny going on
---
If you stack pa perks, I think you're wrong.
---
I know it would be nice if everyone did something. but dont beat yourself up about it. in the end it doesnt matter to you if they were there or not, the result is the same. life is never fair, try not to care about what others are getting for free that you had to work for
---
I just said it didn't start on mine either. 
---
And other people have reported it not starting. There's one several posts down.
---
If you follow me like a bloodhound, stay at the beacon and go all Michael myers on the resilent enemies then the more the merrier.
---
Mine seems to be working, I‚Äôll happily stand in the middle of the daily ops tanking hits in my excavator, barely using any stims on a bloodied build!!
---
Yeah, it's fine, personally I think you should go low health, but that's your choice.  You should also probably do mutations as well as choose to either play in a team or solo, and not both.  I think team is better.
---
That sounds awesome ! One violent night be a lot more easy
---
Awesome, thank you
---
Reached 36 tonight, will be at 38 or 39 by end of Saturday.
---
Completed all weekly tasks and all Dailys, excluding the Nuclear Winter tasks.  
---
According to the Excel sheet in the link in anther post here, you should be at level 30 by the end of Saturday Sept 26th.
---
Is your character a fireman by chance?
---
Seems to work for me, hope it works for you. üëç
---
No. Multiple Sentinel don't share the same percentage of triggering meaning you can have 5 pieces and only 2 or 3 will trigger at once because their percentages are not linked to each other
---
Get a Vampires 50 cal...
---
Lol can't count how many times I've been in this event, where people ran around shooting critters, while ignoring fires, poo piles, drums &amp; spits!!
---
That game mechanic is terrible, on Thursday I was accused of stealing trash from another player, just because I was doing the event: primary cut and I was close when the guy died
---
I have never stolen from another player, I am innocent.
---
A team of 4 stole it and they accused me and they told the guy who died that it was my fault.
---
You two aren't even at war yet
---
I feel that when the gauss is finally fixed, so will the bows. I think they are in a similiar category of weapons, that is the ones that need to be charged... I can only hope Microsoft will inject some money into F76
---
Be careful... Bethesda doesn't know how to buff things for the sake of balance. The best they can manage is to nerf *everything* down to 3/10 instead of balancing it at 7/10 and claim it is "content".
---
But a seperate note.. this might be worth a read:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipkny3/armor_rating_diminishing_returns/  
---
Although the definite statement of "TL/DR: Armor rating in Fallout 76 does not have diminishing returns" is refuted by the author and the comments, it is *still* the best breakdown and workthrough of the damage reduction equation that I've read and made me stack some more DR effects on my character over some other QoL effects.
---
Way too much INT.
---
Too much repair. If you're end game, you'll drown in repair kits.
---
Where is bloody mess and nerd Rage?
---
I would suggest you go and try switching out two UNY pieces for BOL ones and get some points into endurance for some additional adamantium skeleton and fireproof. I just started using adamantium on my bloodied main yesterday and it wether seems like A: limb dmg plays a much bigger role in dmg calculation now or B: Adamantium skeleton got a solid buff.
---
I run with lvl 3 now but on a full UNY set again.
---
Big question:  why the fuck would someone over level 100 care about radaway?  I end up with like 100 a day I dont want.
---
I agree for this game. Those "whales" do help us get more free content. I'm ok with it since this isn't Pay-To-Win and isn't affecting our space. Now if at the end of the scoreboard there was some one shot or quick kill weapon and PvP was always enabled, I'll definitely think differently. 
---
The way it is now is a lot friendlier than a lot of other games of this type. Take GTA V for example, a bunch of shark cards will net people the flying motorcycle. Now in a lot of servers, you can't grind peacefully with certain high reward missions.
---
Enclave thinks less of all who were not on the rigs.
---
This makes me wanna test my AAFFR90 UC Gatling.
---
They are not that awful to be honest. I use a Junkies bow for a while now and I use a vats crit build with it and it can be pretty decent at times... but then this nerf came. It was very upsetting
---
Check out how utterly broken legendary power armor is by watching high level pc pvp videos
---
???
---
Your idea is way better than mine.  I was being vain and named it after myself.
---
I joined A Scorched Earth event tonight. After killing the queen, I got invited to a team. We then went on to destroy Earl. It works sometimes. I want to do events. PS4 gamer tag jAkTSN
---
When the bombs fell a good amount of important personal who went supposed to be in the white springs bunker were sent to a oil rig either in the gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Ocean, were they would survive but atm dude to the white springs enclave power struggle communication is lost.
---
If you can play the objective and stay alive, then it's fine. I teamed up with a random lvl348 yesterday and could achieve elder on the daily op in two tries because he was running around like a headless chicken most of the time, so level doesn't reflect how good you are in the game.
---
Doing events with mixed level teams can be more engaging in my opinion, and makes it feel like a real team effort in the face of adversity. 
---
If someone strays from the beacon, gets lost (easy to do) or just can‚Äôt resist going round hunting things does it really matter ? , it all just adds to the challenging rpg chaos. And the event is repeatable...
---
I did the burning mine with a level 2 in PA; they got 3 levels during the event which was a 14 minute cqb life or death struggle , awesome ! PS I was level 110. 
---
Two stood against many! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important , valour... :)
---
placing paw patrol TVs at everyone‚Äôs camps would most likely crash the game
---
Ae flamer is legacy, it will deal more than paper damage.
---
Epic, glad to hear!
---
Surprisingly the pistol I found can kill almost everything in one clip and the ammo is super cheap since hardly anyone uses it. It can fall under the comando, gunslinger, or guerilla perks and benefits a whole lot from tank killer also any stealth related perks. Follow through, tenderizer, and taking one for the team make a huge difference in general damage output too
---
I wished anyone would join my ops team.  I have no problem killing everything but I the points go so slow solo
---
You mean Power Reboot?
---
Yea so the enclave couldn't even reach apalachia if they wanted to
---
Exactly, you're more likely to group with people who wants to do the Ops when a fresh Public Team announcement pops up
---
My VE15 Pump had 32 shots when I loaded into the game once. It let me fire all 32. Thought it was a visual bug.
---
They're all toxic. Don't seek them out
---
Weird, my sales are basically zero.  The only thing that sells anymore are the weird ammo that I never have much of.  Ops and the legendary perk made ammo insanely easy to get in very large numbers.  Chems too.
---
PC or console?
---
Lol my bad forgot to say I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Good points , and I now have an ammo machine from the raiders plus the armour penetration perk applying to hand guns ( if it works for energy weapons...) so it might be time to dust off the tin foil hat and go gooyfying !
---
You‚Äôll find me at the copper node near bolton greens :)
---
Gotcha. I'm on Xbox.
---
Then you need to play around cover instead of face tanking 5 enemies at once.
---
Dude you don't need to change anything  just jump into a pa set with protocols in it
---
Those places are called **Workshops**.
---
You cannot be sure he did something wrong. Just leave him alone.
---
Yes there is no diminishing returns but there is diminishing effectiveness. A T65 does take more hits but only 2(!) In competition with the excavator armor. With emergency protocols maybe even less
---
Because critters are the fastest way to finish the event.
---
You need to check the container on the tiny door. It isn't automatic.
---
How? Tell me your ways unless it's going bloodied
---
The trade off is that a full set of SS sentinel armor is an insane PITA to craft, and it could literally take months to years to get a full set, let alone a full set with the other mods being decent.  It should be better.    
---
PA doesn't require the same level of grind, and has plenty of great perks to compensate.
---
Pvp is broken whatever you do. I'm talking about pve.
---
yeah I'm in the same boat when it comes to power armour. I have learned most of the power armour mods, but wearing it makes me over encumbered by 300 units.
---
Would you mind elaborating on this a little? My build was rifleman and now it sucks and im in the process of switching to heavy gunner. Do you mean bloodied only? Besides the 9 pts on rifle perks what else do you recommend for a rifleman? Thank you in advance.
---
How was this an unfortunate run in? Did they give you free ammo or something?
---
Grow the fuck up
---
Well they have vertibirds. It's more like unknown status between bases
---
The alcohol drinks don't spoil.  I always keep some red ant ale on hand just in case I need a quick + 50 weight.
---
Keep vendors open?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs adjusting play style and sealing a few perks is all. Good info on it tho.
---
Yea but they would have to refuel alot
---
I wish they'd turn the pitchforks and spears into throwing weapons and add perk cards to increase their damage and one that makes throwing weapons return to you after a few seconds.
---
Hate PA üòÉ
---
That's so cool ü§©. It seems really cozy in the inside.
---
No large ammo cap heavies
---
No bows or crossbow
---
No black powders
---
diminishing returns  
---
1 : a rate of yield that beyond a certain point fails to increase in proportion to additional investments of labor or capital  
---
2 : benefits that beyond a certain point fail to increase in proportion to extended efforts
---
diminishing effectiveness = diminishing returns
---
I don't mind if the god tier ss sentinel armor is better.  I just want some basic legendary effects that improve the PA a bit. We must farm fusion cores to use basic function and all unyielding peps are getting more EXP, can use stealth and are better in v.a.t.s overall (luck and perception)
---
So you want to be able to AFK again in T65 like you were able to a week ago?
---
Hard pass
---
Oh yeah hadnt seen that yet that sucks man always something screwy. Thx.
---
This. It's always the ammo you don't expect to sell either.  Had someone buy 10k flamer fuel today.  
---
The other day it was 10mm.
---
Just keep in it stock and it will sell eventually. Helps if you are in a low level area like near the overseers camp.
---
yeah i really dont want them to touch it tbh.
---
Its the easiest survival mechanic ever, to bend over for it  is nuts. I feel like alot of flavor will be lost if they nerf this. Its a bad change.
---
A lot of times it's because you can't take as much damage as before, even with Serendipity. 
---
A sheepsquatches &amp; deathclaws will bullrush destroy you, I believe the miners have shotguns, and even scorched ghouls can do some damage depending on level. A Yao Guai legendary without any high ground? Good luck not trying to stagger it and just stand still. And in Radiation Rumble when the going gets tough with a bunch of ghouls rushing you? Ooo weee...
---
It's an automated survival mechanism in our brains to just do what you gotta do.
---
I believe what would help is if Bethesda can implement wide radius looting or on the compass, show a star instead of a diamond for legendary enemies. Makes no sense to still have individual looting when witnessing a kill should be enough experience that you participated, especially if you were just blocking, running in circles, tanking enemies. I guess they don't want people to AFK and get free stuff, but...they're still getting that reward at the end. But even team looting would be a big upgrade.
---
And have to carry 3 of the same gun?  No thanks.
---
Unless the Cool time is mandatory no matter what then I understandüòÑ
---
I like when they call "J47" a poor soul who's now completely ghoulified to the point of being feral finally has his number called, and slowly walks out to the counter xD
---
This is the second bug I‚Äôve encountered with buried treasure having to start the whole thing over again. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. I‚Äôm ready to just give up.
---
Do you not die from thirst and dehydration?
---
Same.  I never use stims.
---
I still have all 3.
---
Here a good answer from the same post:
---
"There are basically two ways in Fallout 76 to reduce incoming damage: damage reductions and damage resistance (DR). Damage reductions are applied before damage resistance, which is why you do so little damage against Earle and the SBQ - they have inherent damage reductions of 80% and 70%, respectively before their 400 and 300 armor rating, respectively.
---
Any DR you get from armor, including the defense mod slot, is basically free (apart from carry weight), i.e. there are no other defensive considerations to take care of. Which means that with Scout, Heavy Combat or Secret Service armor, you get to around 300 DR as a starting point
---
Increasing DR beyond that point has opportunity costs because it happens via legendary effects (there are loads of them to consider), perks (same deal) or mutations (which have negative effects, which in turn can be mitigated by a perk). And there are in almost all cases alternatives that are just plain better than heaping on more DR/ER:
---
Perks that give you DR/ER are considered weak because you might as well spend those perk points on either more damage, which translates into less time for a mob to deal damage to you, or perks that reduce damage: Blocker gives much more defensive value for your perk points than Barbarian. Dodgy+Action Boy/Girl is way better than Evasive and Moving Target provided you have the AP to spare. Serendipity is so much stronger than Junk Shield that the latter is hardly worth mentioning except as a joke.
---
As for legendary effects, at the aforementioned 300 DR, 15% damage reduction does about the same defensive job of reducing incoming damage as adding 250 more DR. A full Vanguard's or Bolstering set adds a mere 175 DR at maximum effectiveness. So a full set of Vanguard's and Bolstering is objectively worse than a single piece of mob-type specific armor (Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, etc.) against that mob type. Which means that having one piece each of Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, Mutant Slayer's and Ghoul Slayer's is better defense against the four most common mob types in the game than a full set of Vanguard's or Bolstering, and you still have one 1\* legendary armor mod slot free for something else, say Auto-Stim or Life-Saving. More DR doesn't help against Mirelurk royalty or insects anyway because their danger comes from staggers and/or poison. Animals are basically only dangerous due to their staggers and melee damage, and I have yet to come even close to being in mortal danger from a group of raiders.
---
And we haven't even considered the insanely strong Sentinel's, Cavalier's and Blocker 3\* effects.
---
In essence, the only instance where Vanguard's and other DR increases are possibly better than the alternatives is Earle because he and his brood don't fall into any of the mob types covered by a legendary prefix. And even in that fight, fire resistance and poison resistance seem to do a better over-all job of keeping you alive than more DR.
---
**TL;DR** even if the diminishing returns effect on DR/ER is weak where effective health is concerned, stacking DR beyond what you get from armor is still, in almost all cases, a worse idea than going for other defensive options." - DerGudy
---
Oh on my commando too i hate it, I literally just use it to dig lead ore but I find it easier just to hop in one rather than changing perks. Your other option is just to spam stimpacks once you start taking damage
---
I think it's because of old code. Meat piles are new, but ash liles were in fo4
---
Pa did just get a pretty good buff with electrical absorption. As a pa main I'm pretty happy with it
---
Well either way you look at.. at least you know the lore.
---
Oh nice! That's handy thanks. :):)
---
Yes. PC tho
---
How about lvl 100 plus picking on lvl 30s and under.. the other day I was playing with my buddies we all under lvl and a high lvl guy kept killing us, I message them why are they killing us they said it‚Äôs part of the game
---
I've never heard of cooldowns persisting on different servers if there are no active nuke zones, but I haven't seen that much so I'm not informed
---
I have no room to store junk . I have to wait for someone to buy all my bulked junk from my vending machine and then restock with all the bulked junk I'm carrying around.
---
my camp is in unnukeable zone but not bad idea I guess.
---
Yeah, cooldown should be/is per server/silo.
---
Well, theres lots with 76 that is a different way than it should but its still playable. Just tedious
---
Geographically Harpers Ferry is only 49 miles from DC (IRL) as the crow flies, it would make absolute sense to have missions to the Capital Wasteland!
---
Hopefully those weapons will become useful in the new daily Ops if they become more varied.
---
That's not going to happen, besides introducing new ammo (and it's bugs/exploits) this needs a complete overhaul of the receiver mods. Not to mention the damage boni you want and the nerfing of existing prefixes.
---
Right now we can have different loadouts as you want. Just grab the gun that already gives all those boni. Electric damage? Grab your tesla. Want to do more damage to bots? Use troubleshooter. Assassin against humans... asf.
---
I am surprised there isn't a rifle related pa perk like stabilised
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Most people I know of don't really run the entire nuke silo... There are ways to skip to the final stage. On average I can  launch a nuke in 5min.
---
I too need the same thing but I'm on xbox meet somewhere in the middle on ps4 lmaooo
---
I got it on pc but changed servers and it went back to normal
---
You have three options here:
---
As you mentioned, you can pay Bethesda for Fallout 1st and use one or more of your 4 other characters (up to 5 characters per account) to carry extra items.  You can use the Fallout 1st Private Server to transfer items between characters.  Personally, I would have Fallout 1st just for the Tent and the Scrap box anyway.  
---
The second is to have a second system with a separate Fallout 76 account.  You can then directly trade between characters.  Bethesda would get some money for the game sale, but that's it.  I don't have a second system, not worth it to me at this point.  However, when the PS5 comes out, I'll likely get the PS5 and keep my PS4 and set up a second account.  Assuming that I'm still playing the game on a regular basis.
---
Thirdly you can ask a friend.  Seriously, all you need is a few friends with Fallout 1st and ask them if you can use their private worlds.
---
It only is if you join and do nothing. Had a lvl 120 not revive anyone and move really slowly from point to point picking up ammo.
---
The reason it was bothersome is that in some cases from what I noticed is that sometimes having more players means more enemy spawns. At least I noticed this with Blood Eagles cloaked in the mines.
---
Just be close to the objective and move quickly as possible, reviving fallen comrades and you're cool. If you can, share some defensive or offensive card for the high levels. Defensive is better like Life Giver or some of the increased damage resistance cards.
---
Soft light game on point
---
You will still cap out at +35 DR. But yes, the more health means you can have high DR.
---
Appliances under fridge section if you have one
---
Almost like NCR meets Appalachia. I dig it!
---
Oh man can someone teach me the way haha
---
I imagine an expedition to the capital wasteland may take us to either the underground and clearing out ghouls, or to the GNR plaza since that has recently been recreated anyway in Fallout 4 for the creation club. 
---
I'm very interested in the Mojave because I don't think it'll mean going towards New Vegas. Perhaps we can help defend some settlers in New Reno or Jericho whilst they are evacuated. Places that were mentioned in game and in the Fallout Bible but never actually seen in person. If we went closer to New Vegas Mr House would become immediately aware of our presence and it wouldn't really conform with established canon. 
---
I don't mind canon being stretched like with Taggerdys BOS in 76, but I don't want to see it entirely disregarded and broken out right.
---
With Ammo Factory new legendary perk cards I don't see any reason buying ammo from vendor. I craft all my ultricite ammo.
---
Meat week happened just fine for me last night, although Grahm wasn't in attendance for any of it. Chally was there - although at one event even chally went for a wander, could see her running away from the event.
---
If anything the marsupial jump wasted him time.
---
I run both T65 and Excavator (walking packback) and there's a significant difference between the two.
---
I could tank a blast from the Imposter Sheepsquash before electric absorption in T65, not with the excavator and not with the T51 (althouth an X01 might have)
---
Server hop and check again?
---
No. My health drained right down to a small slither, but I didn't die.
---
With a b/10 gauss, all rifle/sneak attack/bonus damage perks, between 6pm-6am, and a headshot, sure.  That‚Äôs pretty specific.
---
Just face it.  End game is either auto rifles or heavy guns.  Rifleman isn‚Äôt even on the fringes anymore.
---
I picked one up months ago from the train stations on Morgantown. Put it in my stash and pull it when I need it.
---
I appreciate the cynicism but I sincerely doubt it. They put almost nothing in place to keep me from getting 120FPS at near max settings on my 2080 Ti/R9 3900X desktop. The only reason they wouldn't tweak settings for better performance/visuals is if their bosses don't see any value in it.
---
T65 is still tankier than Excavator. The main reason I use PA is for my heavy gunner character. Alot of heavy gun perk cards requires PA to be effective. 
---
Bethesda are horrible at balancing weapons and armors. I doubt they will even add new legendary effects to anything. All they did was port the entire fo4 to fo76 can add bunch of restrictions...
---
Reviving in the water during A Colossal Problem works.
---
Block and ignore.
---
Events teams lead the way! I‚Äôve always found nobody wants to be first to an event and do it solo. Especially a hard one like this, but an events team bringing In a few people usually brings more people.
---
Base on Bethesda's history for bugs and glitches, this is pretty much asking for another exploits to happen...
---
But yeah, everyone has been asking for it.....
---
There is usually another shovel on the counter in the little museum building.
---
You sure it was a duper? I was in foundation the other day and a lv249 came up to me trading eh why not. My gosh this guy had an incredible arsenal of every heavy gun going was nuts. However the guy could of literally farming flux and outfits to trade for them so I couldn't say. If 2234567 mags and stimpacks though yeah kinda duped.
---
Buy a 90 reduced weight one for your stash box üòö
---
Just wait till you waste ammo and junk repairing your weapon and Armor after launching a nuke only for the server to disconnect and it‚Äôs all gone back to normal lol happened to me first time launching a nuke ha
---
While not an easy feat to find one I have a weightless shovel on me at all times just for this quest...
---
I generally message the newer players first. If I just show up next to a low level I put up the present emote, but they are generally skittish and walk/run away from me. I don‚Äôt just drop stuff anymore because either 1 new player takes it all instead of sharing with the other new players or a high lvl snatches it first. Like do you really need modded lvl 5 leather armor that bad at lvl 250, come on now.
---
So that would be multiple new recievers for every weapon, multiple new variant for every ammo type - and a whole lorry load of enemy specific weapons to carry around for occasional sporadic use, all within limited stash/carry weight and quick wheel slots. Fine if all you do is specific events but far to cumbersome around the wider wasteland. No thanks.
---
Take a look at what's already available in armour and weapon enemy specific items and you find the vast majority are little used and are scrapped/sold the moment an averagely better generic type is found. About the only ones ever retained and used are Troubleshooter Armour and Ultracite/Primed (mostly Heavy) Weapons.
---
The easiest food to craft and last very long is Tato salad.
---
Have you tried the enclave bunker or bos vendors? Sounds technical
---
I have to a few times, not running all the perk cards I could to mitigate damage. Still not that squishy, I could get better pa but damn, that 200 carry weight lol
---
Chally was at my event as well
---
There is one at Tygart water facility in a port-a-potty on the wall outside of the front entrance
---
So i‚Äôve been thinking about this while levelling up a new Chameleon Archer character...
---
Up to about level 45 , my bows were too under powered to be much use so for 25 levels i used a level 20 suppressors pump action shotgun with a magic vats effect that i looted. This was despite some kind person giving me a fixer at level 20.
---
I pushed the boundaries a bit early on and did Earle (approx 3 shots per wendigo), Daily Ops (approx 1 or 2 shots per kill, mainly 1), SBQ mob clearance, white springs (usually 1 head shot per level 62 ghoul) and killed a griefer at meat week with it .  
---
I even did campfire tales so really pushing the envelope. 
---
At level 45 I only had 1 shot gun perk i got from a pack plus about 6 generic damage perks , everything else being qol , survival , sneak, Archery or random stuff from packs.
---
Conclusion : while it lasts, a vats magic shotgun seems to be one answer to having any sort of build imaginable while still being able to very effectively defend yourself and contribute to events while getting on with playing the game.
---
I'm not unfortunately, I'm Xbox but thanks for the offer. I've been told where to grab the quest from tho, so that'll be my next objective when I can get on. I've now got my camp on a lead deposit, so I'll get a steady flow of lead for a while now at least.
---
No - so long as you stay by the beacons
---
Fair enough. Good luck out there then. :)
---
I might be waay off on what information you're looking for.
---
But they're two types of cooldown.
---
1. The cooldown time for the silo itself to reset (Can't remember the length of time.
---
2. A player locked cooldown (3 hours)
---
I speed run constantly, after the first lauch your personal timer starts immediately.
---
So you can hit 3 nukes, let's say for arguments sake the whole process of nuking, killing and doing that 3 times actually takes about 1.5 hours (please don't attack the time, it's just an example)
---
It means over a good days session you're still hitting the SBQ or whatever at least 9 times a day. 
---
You CAN force more nukes, but that's exploits and not advised.
---
Hope that helps, or I've rambled on for fuck all üòâ
---
gotta get that plan in the next 2 days tho
---
I feel you. I seriously hate it when there is none. 
---
In those situation, I quick travel to Flatwoods: there is one behind the church near or on one of the graves.
---
I always head there around 5 mins to the hour, cook up some Chally Feed and see if any Greens are around (old ones that didn't get picked tend to still be around at the start of the new event) then leap on a spit or drums.
---
Had to move my camp thanks to One Wasteland and Meat Week. That level 100 Sheepsquatch kept spawning right on me and trashing it, and I've only ever seen one person come down there to take part.
---
You can definitely have too many people collecting shit. Half of the time I‚Äôm trying to collect critter meat, someone runs over and starts picking up my kills... those people could at least be getting that .08 or whatever and keep the bar from going down.
---
You have to go bloody for several reasons.  One is damage.  The second, and probably more important, is the unyielding agility boost to beat high level enemy awareness.  You can do pretty well with AG in the low 20s (15 base, raider underarmor, legendary armor effects, bird bones mutation), but lvl 100 enemies are difficult to reliably hide from without min/maxing every possible bonus to stealth, including shadowed armor mods, the Fixer bonus and a harder to detect armor piece.  Without all that, you‚Äôll get spotted constantly in events like Colossal Problem.
---
You can brute force your way through a fight to some degree with commando DPS, but rifleman is too slow and methodical for the faster paced action of Daily Ops and public events.  Picking off enemies while outside is fine, but in the confines of a building or event area, rifleman just can‚Äôt really keep up anymore.
---
You could offset a slower rate of fire by previously going bloody and min/maxing, but sniper rifles no longer hit hard enough, and hardened receivers on guns like handmades and fixers are completely outclassed by automatic receivers now.
---
Get yourself a cursed shovel, it weighs nothing.
---
Ty :)
---
If you play ACP you will often be rewarded the Cursed Shovel with 90% weight reduction. I held on to mine especially for Philippi as I was fed up with finding no Shovel spawns, not even the much posted 'Guaranteed' one near the tree.
---
Cool, I didn't know about this. Was it always there?
---
It looks like someone mistook domestic tables for domestic kitchen tables lol.
---
I have this question too! Thanks for asking for me!
---
I'm not on right now but Bethesda said the event would be running till the 28th
---
I always do trades through Reddit, i check on ppls karma and when i'm not sure about a safe trade i ask for a courrier.
---
Go to the nukazone website and they have all the codes. Or just check to see if yours matches. But it's way easier just using their active codes on the website
---
It's not like you are newb first 50 levels and then you turn pro, lol.
---
Used to be an effect on Harpoon guns too, and with the ammo spawning bug it made for some crazy rolls (you would shoot one guy with fletchette harpoons, it would "explode" and kill people around them. All the bodies would have five harpoons on them. Used to run through Harpers Ferry and end up on the other side with five times as many harpoons.)
---
I buy my ammo .50, fuel and fusion cells, usually by the thousand....
---
Put the body in the ground then check behind the big  tree for a shovel. One spawns everytime :)
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Just use Reddit. Also, screen record if you don't go through Reddit.
---
Check the nukacrypt website
---
Thanks man!
---
It would be nice to have different types of ammo like in FO NV , hollow point, armor pierce,... You didnt need other receivers for that. But types like armor pierce ammo were more expensive to craft.
---
Whaaat? Damn. hopefully they fix that! Pretty sure we had that issue with the current build items before?
---
As a low level who can‚Äôt solo a lot , I repeat then 5 times or more
---
Don't feel bad. If someone drops that stuff for you, it's because they want you to have that stuff.
---
Also, it's a little bit selfish, because, at least for me, I drop that stuff to clear inventory space when I already hit my caps limit, hahaha
---
The only time I've had 500 in mine is when they glitch out reloading

finally, someone with the guts to help. get me an induction coil. glad to see you're not a flake.
---
Thank you! That'd be awesome :)
---
Thanks
---
I have one with some second star just sitting in my box. I think in 76 they do mixed damage tho so I'm not sure if they don't do anything or are just a very combo of an unpopulat usage weapon and an unpopular effect.
---
How funny is "One More Pils" tho
---
I think it is STUPID to remove/change to make it an even simpler mechanic.
---
love this game but find the pandering to whiny barbie's complaints so off putting. 
---
Hey Bethesda...please remove the ability of enemies to do damage to players. it is so annoying. Game will be much better then.
---
Never seen an rper.  Never been bothered by anyone.  Playing since beta.  *shrug.*
---
Those big industrial purifiers produce water so fast and in such abundance that you'll have trouble even selling it all.
---
I'm not sure where you are, I'm in Australia and have 1st. I'm not always in private but If I'm online and you need a private world, you can message me and I'll switch to private for you. Ign watchoutheresbel
---
Same, but I managed to by one on a player vendor a few weeks later. Hope you can too.
---
Yeah, you're not wrong. Will upload some more today. The sides are quite empty as I reached max budget!! Need to learn to decor more before going crazy with the outer structure
---
I really want a stg 44, the plain one, not radium. I love that gun, so beautiful. I am obsessed with it
---
Oh no, it‚Äôll reload all 32 rounds.  Without any reload speed effects in play, it takes forever.
---
Grafton day seems to happen every time I come near Grafton.
---
I've killed the Grafton monster so many times I feel like I should get some sort of frequent flyer points or something.
---
Tysm
---
I mean, dropping it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgive it back‚Äù. It will vanish when you leave the server.
---
2nd person to say this - I honestly never noticed but now I 100% see it lool
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve done trades before and everyone‚Äôs been so good. Just bad luck to get the one guy who thinks cheating is fine.
---
And the Greens !!!! :) Please for the love of all herbivores don‚Äôt forget the greens!!! ha ha
---
Silo pieces aren‚Äôt really ever used anymore.
---
I‚Äôve got a screen shot of our Xbox chat, and I‚Äôve reported on the game itself.
---
 #Microsoft, pls get someone to fix this
---
This worked perfectly for me, thanks!
---
Dude this helped me understand a lot thank you and no way I‚Äôm going to attack you on your example it‚Äôs a great example tbh thanks!
---
hmm.. didnt know that.. will keep trying till i get one, tnx
---
same.. but it gets a bit annoying, having to go look at other places for one
---
I have no idea how meat week works, but I *do* know that using a drum or a spit helps.
---
Basically every time I show up I hop on one and just stay there.
---
Same here, 2 handed PA build and can't seem to get the tenderizer plan or the war glaive from daily ops.
---
Didn't Mr. House basically sleep for a large chunk of the 200 years? Like New Vegas wasn't directly under his control for sometime and required reigning in some of the raider groups
---
Once ppl start to know, he won't doing much trades
---
Some high areas still have minimum monster levels, but for the most part things will be your level
---
thats true but so long as youre on the server and nobody else picks it up the loot back stays there
---
No worries dude.
---
Got one last night! Thank you for the help üôè
---
You can send that to the mods and keep an eye out to see if anyone uses that name here. Maybe create a ticket for it through Bethesda website.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt it just slows it. You‚Äôre better off cleaning up and killing and collecting greens. Standing on the drums is pointless
---
Unfortunately reporting him won‚Äôt do much. As far as Bethesda are concerned, you willingly just game him the item.
---
There‚Äôs a Facebook group to name and shame, but doing it on here will have the post removed.
---
Use the reddit market site for the game, always check Karma. Get a courier off there if you‚Äôre worries about being scammed.
---
We need an emote for new comers then...
---
There are a whole lot of Government Bunkers and Military Installations throughout the country. The nearest one would be Mount Weather, just over the border with Virginia, closer to us than DC is, and DC is just an hour from Harpers Ferry. Another, a bit farther but not completely out of reach, is Raven Rock, the one with the ZAX that will become John Henry Eden, which although supposedly empty when the War happened, and would remain so until after 2241, Beth can always make up something that happened in the years we know nothing about, and it wouldn't break canon.
---
It‚Äôs still top tier single shot damage for a sniper rifle.
---
The explosive AoE on gauss weapons seems a little different than the standard legendary effect.  It doesn‚Äôt seem to be boosted by Demo Expert and the radius seems smaller.  Granted, my experience comes from a gauss mini, but I can‚Äôt really tag enemies with gauss splash damage like I can with an explosive 50cal.
---
Daily Ops!
---
Just spend some time after the OP is over looting ammo.
---
I come out up 1-200 uc 2mm.
---
The Sierra Madre, it draws in scavengers and the villa section has a history of being gone through its just too hostile of an environment to live. It would be quite easy to let us loot an unexplored area that was picked clean by Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Just move some pistolperks to perception.
---
So that was the annoying sound following me around. Didn‚Äôt think of itbefore I read this. Just hopped server. Thank you
---
Single action revolver is the worst...
---
This is right. As someone who launches quite often, you have to keep track of when you last launched from a specific silo.  On more than one occasion I have prepped let's say bravo, popped in my keycard and found out my 3 hour cooldown for bravo is half an hour away from reset.
---
Luckily these days I can usually join a public team and convince a random person to come and I'll drop them a card.  I usually have to end up explaining why every single door is locked and the laser grids are all up though......so it's a lot simpler just to keep track of your launch times lol.
---
Scamming is actually against terms and conditions now, so Bethesda can do something about it. PRE Update 22 there was nothing about scamming/conning etc so people could get away with it, not they can't if sufficient proof is there.
---
It‚Äôs a old bug, it used to happen to me all the time when the game was still new but I thought it got patched
---
Plasma core base ammunition pool is 250, by having 350 they are already overcharged. 500 per Gatling plasma clip is a bit of a glitch that happens sometimes between switching weapons
---
I really want to explore the possible link between the Moleminers and Ghost People as well as get some nice horror themes back in Fallout.
---
Friend, where you been?
---
I had 900 fusion cells for 1c for months, longing for you to take them home, that I just converted last night.
---
You on PS4?
---
No, the enemies will scale to you! Don‚Äôt join at like, Level 4, but honestly anything above 15 with a decent gun and some stims can at least stay by the beacons and hide behind the high-levels. You‚Äôre helping just by being there and not dying!!
---
All I want is the Tato salad recipe, I have been grinding so hard and nothing, I feel your pain
---
Debuff: Garand thumb. 
---
Reload speed -25%
---
Me playing it: ‚ÄúGood LORD this is annoying, it‚Äôs like the real fucking ‚Äî oh....wait now I get it...‚Äù
---
I feel this. Its not that I would NEVER pvp...
---
It's just that pvp in this game isn't fun.
---
Lots of balance issues that I won't get into...
---
But..
---
I think they have an opportunity to make faction choice more relevant, and give people (like me) a good reason to pvp...
---
Forget being able to grind both opposing factions, I'd love to see us have to make a CHOICE, and when you do, you just made enemies out of half the player base... but you'd also then have clear allies. Maybe do a workshop-like contested territory with tangible benefits for the faction controlling it....
---
I dunno. Just ain't fun running around till you bump into some random and either destroy them or get destroyed...
---
Yeah, I used it in Daily Ops to get easy ammo and against Volatile Blood Eagles I could get headshots with a damage of 100 with no perk whatsoever.
---
It doesn't do more than 15 on any other enemy, but on humans it's pretty good.
---
Yeh I've had pieces drop, actually completed a full VANSent set, took waaay to long though.
---
Also can't really mod it.
---
I fully agree, though. Looks slick.
---
As someone who repairs, sorry uses energy weapons I also agree :-)
---
I've got it doing 200+ to the head on some enemies like super mutants.
---
These perks will help you : Blocker, Lone wander, fireproof, adamantium skeleton. Also get a dense mod on your chest. The grounded mutation and scaly skin is good as well. 
---
Try to make an armor set with the pieces that have 15% damage reduction when standing still. Look for them at vendors or go on the reddit market. 
---
However, as you said, offense is the best defense. Specilasing in one weapon category and getting all the damage perks is probably not a bad idea, even if you do want to be casual about the game. This will save you ammo as well.
---
I‚Äôm interested
---
Thanks :) I‚Äôll see what I can do. Don‚Äôt want him doing it to anyone else
---
Cool thanks :)
---
Careful son of a bitch attacked me when his big clunky ass got in front of me shooting a super mutant
---
I remember that system from when i played runescape... Like 15 years ago
---
Faster fire rate is noticeably faster on a gatling, but explosive probably has the edge on DPS, especially after the new math.  If you factor in splash damage on nearby enemies, explosive is definitely the DPS winner.  FFR is superior for weapons with a moderate rate of fire, like an automatic handmade, but I think explosive is better for very slow or very fast guns.  Faster fire rate on an LMG or hunting rifle feels like a waste.
---
That being said, a j/25 gatling is a nice gun.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt want splash damage blowing up nearby cars and flinging that legendary ghoul somewhere into Ohio.
---
I‚Äôd keep the j/e/250 if I were you.  That‚Äôs a really good gun.
---
ah so  its  a glitch then.. ok never mind... i thought i was missing something i went through perk cards again dint spot anything that gives any benifit.. but Angry turtle in one of his recent videos was showing heavy gunner build and his gatling plasma had 500 rounds so i was curious.. ill ask him in video itself to see if he replies.
---
First thing i do is always putting my meat into the pot. This sounds wrong...
---
Anyways, the other players mostly have loaded in when i did that.
---
Got a spare if you want it. Vampire bs one. Also, by now that has to be a mass grave .
---
He was asleep but still aware of sorts IIRC. The families never took the Lucky 38 because he still had plenty of monitoring stations and robots protecting his assets. The Brotherhood leading an expedition from West Virginia, presumably in a Vertibird of some sort, would warrant House needing to be woken up as for all he knows they could be the Army.
---
So true. I was at Vault 76 with a lvl 12 and a lvl 350 Player. Guess who took the 20 stimpaks.
---
lol, tnx but i found another.. i mean its not hard to get another one, its just a little annoying to have to go look at other places for one and the travel back
---
I have more ammo then ever with the new ammo factory legendary perk, cuttin about with about 30k 5.56 and 5mm ammo
---
It doesn‚Äôt state that having it bypasses having to consent to PvP while you‚Äôre on a public team. It‚Äôs a bug. An unintended result of the perk. Therefore it‚Äôs an exploit. And no, I‚Äôm not bitching about it, I think it‚Äôs a welcome change. I‚Äôm just trying to see it from their side.
---
Some ppl are just R*t*rds
---
Before you load into a server quickly hop on the scoreboard and it should fix it

Survival is a bit harder and yes we are going through ammo. I also prefer the stealth/rifle build, but have a more general build as I like to carry about 12 weapons just for fun (5 rifles in total). This allows me to adapt to what‚Äôs in front of me, but the difference being I can change my perk cards to suit. This might be a bit harder for you at your present level. Tips for your survival, I currently run 5 pieces of chameleon armour and try to scope most high level enemies to the head to reduce ammo wastage. I can get through most areas without being touched, when I choose to play this way. If i get in a jam, I will normally switch the rifle to my fixer, but with the chameleon armour generally crouching And staying still when taking a few hits and not panicking will get you back to a hidden status. When I do big events and daily ops I will change to a heavy gun build and this is where your vampire based weapons come in handy. Personally I would suggest a V-Gatling plasma Or a V-Gatling laser V mini gun as the LMG has limited bullet capacity and is not so effective if you are taking a beating. Overall, I think if you enjoy the game as a sniper, you are much more likely to be systematic about how you enter areas and that in itself will lead to a higher chance of survival, if you go in all guns blazing I would suggest stacking your defence and finding some guns you can have fun with. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way, just have fun and find what works for you.

Whatchu got?
---
To expand on that, now that I'm thinking of it...
---
Allow us to dabble with various factions, earn SOME favor and reward while remaining neutral... but to get upper tier stuff, you'd have to align yourself, officially.
---
This would then tag you as a member of that particular faction, and make you hostile to their enemies, both NPCs and other player characters who chose opposite of you. 
---
With 3 or 4 factions, this would maybe only have to lock you OUT of that ONE faction who is directly opposed, but you could then be neutral or even friendly with others. 
---
Allow us to rank up with our faction by pvping folks from other factions...
---
If you wanna keep the wild west 'anyone can be an enemy' feel... let us still choose to kill people in our own clan if they deserve it, but it'll hurt your faction rep...
---
Pop events hourly or so in contested zones that maybe give a worldwide buff for the winning faction... once a day pop an event that your faction MUST win to open up the rarest items in your faction vendor... 
---
I know this isn't likely to actually be seen and implemented by the team... just spitballing ideas that would be compelling for me...
---
Don‚Äôt sneak and take off all your rifleman and other damage boosting cards.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I have just tried that, it didn't work.
---
It only weighs 0.08 for me. I think it‚Äôs food but don‚Äôt quote me on it. I have both perks because I use ridiculous amounts of Nuka Cola Quantums and chems while fighting.
---
*laughs in Age Of Empires Online*
---
The only eay not to break canon is to have both groups just miss eachother by a seccond to don't start a war
---
Old post, but whatever. You are one of biggest whiny bitch that I've ever seen.  Stop trying to enforce your preferences and claim its "unethicial* or" bad behavior ". Not everyone plays the same way you do.
---
nah true evil debuff would be no ping noise
---
I watch oxhorn
---
We need this fixed asap im at lvl 35 and it just did that to me finished all the way and repeated it self all over again 3 times
---
With the appropriate perks, probably
---
37, will get 39 tomorrow. Its a bit more generous this season since you can get 2500 score per day from dailies. Personally today is the first day I played more than the minimum to complete the dailies as well as skipped a couple NW ones that weren't worth the time.   
---
I **Highly** recommend you make a copy of LifeKeru's Spreadsheet, it is a very good tool for keeping on top of the season and goal setting.   
---
[LifeKeru's Season 2 Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=1495641013)
---
Doesn't really work that well, since 
---
Heavy: LOUD,
---
Sniper: ·µ†·µò·∂¶·µâ·µó
---
It is possible, but you definitely wouldn‚Äôt have enough points to get all the perks you‚Äôd want.
---
Last night I joined a DO team, did the Op and then left and started a casual team. Three people joined my casual team and then entered Daily Ops and proceeded to use ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emotes and then thumbed me down - what gives? 
---
Am I doing it wrong?
---
I‚Äôve got a plan. What ya got to offer for it as it seems I‚Äôve been let down by 1k presents and someone else with a legacy so ya got anything to Chuck at me?
---
It is utterly draining.
---
Sorry you got burned, but you would have even if the trade went perfectly.  A b/e handmade is way more valuable than a ts/e fixer.
---
This would be awesome, the blank screen irks me so much, I would even settle with cycling static images
---
Yeah, there my two favorite playstyles though so it's a nice thought for me to combine the two
---
Not reaallly if you mean sniper rifles and heavy guns as they rely on 2 different stats for their damage cards. However if you mean playing like a sniper wih a heavy gun then yes you can, explosive flamer or gatling gun best options for this
---
I wasn‚Äôt bothered with that side of it, I have another handmade bloodied that I use. Was more just frustration of it going wrong haha
---
I know people do this but it sucks as
---
I am pretty active here and I‚Äôm still low on karma. Everything has gone well so far but I‚Äôm
---
Sure one day I‚Äôll get burned
---
One is strength one is perception so you could max damage in both areas but you would need a lot of perk points
---
Complete the main quest. When you get access to a certain rank there‚Äôs a terminal with the schematics on it.
---
From a specific terminal in the enclave area.
---
Main story
---
If you completed enclave questline, there's a terminal in the armory section of the whitesprings bunker that has the schematics to craft x01 armor.
---
it's 0.75 normally... guess i need to get myself the foodie backpack
---
Yeah I've been thinking about a lot since I've already got a semi decent sniper build going and I'm only level 25, I just decided to come on here to get people's expertise
---
I was at the same impasse once too and I decided to go heavy without power armor. Works good. 
---
They are polar opposites when it comes to playing, so I really recommend you to choose. What level are you?
---
Got ya im on the bit where I need to call a nuke in for the enclave but I have access to most of it so would that still be doable ?
---
Please!! Ed-E was my favorite companion and I miss him a lot
---
I'm only level 25
---
If you are on the "I am become death" quest, you should be able to access the area.
---
For VATS efficiency....
---
Hardened receiver
---
Aligned long barrel
---
Swift mag
---
Forceful stock
---
Reflex sight
---
Use a Suppressor for stealth, and go for a stinging mag if you‚Äôre ok with losing some VATS cost for better armor pen.  If you ADS a lot, a Stabilized stock will help with some recoil, but you lose a lot of durability without a forceful stock.
---
Thats what I am on will have a look for this terminal thank you and thanks all for the reply's
---
Yw....have a great weekend.
---
Alright, you still have a lot of room to grow. Here's what i'd do: Love playing on a team? Heavy. Love playing solo? Sneak.
---
Here is a possible build,
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334bc8&amp;d=sq2sx2lt2ar2an2ao0a04ic4c72ek1p02s22s32sr2s12l71le2ip2e60&amp;m=c9fe8
---
They "upgraded" their lighting system in the wastelanders update. 
---
They made it worse. AMD Navi users have to put up with weird zebra Stripes on all reflective surfaces and literally everything looks wet and shiny. Very bugged. 
---
Wish we had only your problem. They should have fixed it already but they seem to not care about it at all and gets ignored. Ridiculous Devs at Bethesda.
---
You too pal and may rng luck be with you üëç
---
I suggest looking it up before you make any big decisions like that.
---
There‚Äôs at least four shovels at the location.  There‚Äôs one near the grave, another leaning against a tree, and at least two inside the building.  There might be another leaning against a broken tombstone, as well.
---
Either way, they added a whole bunch of shovels to the location so you‚Äôll never be assed out if someone grabs the one by the grave.
---
Now this is gonna sound really sad but I would prefer to play on a team but I have absolutely nobody to play with
---
It may be a legacy double ones
---
Yeah you would have to max strength and perception together and agility and luck you could get something near what you need but it would need legendary perks too. There's a web site you clan plan your build can't remember name off hand. You could try that see if you can.
---
Still not fixed after many months. It's getting ignored, should be high priority. Apparently they don't care when they break the game for AMD Navi users.
---
Yeah just... something other than a white screen
---
Ive gotten every plan for the tenderizer except the tenderizer itself üôÉ
---
Explosives does the work pretty well too. I just aim in somewhat right direction.
---
Oh totally. This mission is suppose to be a real quick one. But searching for a shovel is a pain
---
I have no idea on the practicality..but I like it!
---
really? shit thought there were only two.. thanks for the info
---
What platform buddy?
---
I just stand in front of my tiny teammates and soak all the damage then we move on to the next beacon.
---
That actually seems quite good so its greatly appreciated, but sadly I already have 8 points in perception so that's a problem
---
Xbox
---
what big decision?
---
What you could work towards is a stealth sniper build which is what I run, (heavy stealth) the build I made is a loosely constructed one that isn‚Äôt the best.
---
feelsbadman
---
I'm the same, although I've seen guys fall at the end of events since One Wasteland and I'll protect their junk for them, sometimes grabbing it to stop looters and dropping it for them when they return.
---
Spending bulllion on a Backpack mod.
---
Graham only rewards the good HUMANS, not the good bots who sit on drums spinning their cameras around all day
---
That's not true. There is more than a century and thousands of miles between 76 and 2, anything can happen without it affecting what happens after that, especially if as it seems from current datamines, there will be no contact between Rahmani and Maxson.
---
This is the most challenging event in the game in my opinion,  and has one of best scripted stories in Fallout leading up to it.
---
I found it genuinely chilling to be on the battlefield knowing what‚Äôs to come , if you haven‚Äôt done the story it‚Äôs definitely worth doing. Baaaaaaa.
---
Anyway, the main challenge is that ensuring completion needs some serious preparation and tactics to be able to hold all 3 pylons , tank or fight the robots and / or the Imposter.
---
(I see some posts saying it‚Äôs easy , as long as other people activate the pylons etc . Well, that‚Äôs not really easy then is it, it‚Äôs luck.)
---
The event has a fairly long time to prepare appropriate armour , weapons , stealth, health and ap buffs for a reason. 
---
This preparation might put people off and the lure of another fedora is not that appealing .
---
Then there are also some bad experiences like someone activating the recall early or one shotting the ISS while others hold the pylons. 
---
Overall though , still the hardest challenge in the game imo and the basis for my robot hunting character.
---
To quote a wise man : ‚ÄúThe only good robot is a dead robot . Kill it and loot it!‚Äù
---
Lmao shut up I just gave my 4th away to noobs at the meat week event
---
Oh it's possible. You're just not going to be very effective at either.
---
That is what I'm currently going towards but I'm pretty fixated on the idea of slamming the two together
---
You should really look into a build of sorts. There are hundreds of possible builds to choose from, finding one to your liking shouldn‚Äôt be difficult. Obviously if you and another 170 can‚Äôt beat Primal Cuts then both of you need to take a long, hard look at your perks/weapons.
---
Yeah that's my worry
---
8 mn is doable solo, but it requires good knowledge of the event layout and good dps for the last wave
---
But if you are 2, things become quickly easy. I don't mind much about who is doing what as long as at least one person is awake.
---
This game really only wants you to play with one sub type of weapon so what your are going for will be very tedious to get to.
---
Automatic Tesla Rifle very helpful, you can give damage on multiple and spot it.
---
To save modules and your sanity, roll once and if you don‚Äôt get your desired effect try some other time. 
---
For example: if you need a bloodied gauss minigun, don‚Äôt spend all your modules when the first effect you get is a ghoul slayers gauss minigun.
---
I did change my build during last season. I have an AA lever action rifle, rank 3 of all the rifleman perks, rank 3 tank killer and some other stuff like bloody mess, concentrated fire etc etc.
---
I spent a lot of time to find that gun and respec my special stats for that since my initial build was really random. I just feel frustrated that I'm gonna have th change things around again.
---
But okay, what would you suggest?
---
Ever since the nerf, tse is outperforming every other effect - as long as demolitions perk is ranked up. Here‚Äôs a video of it being tested https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9EeNcV7OxZU&amp;t=617s
---
Yes, but you‚Äôll be half-assed at both.  The SPECIAL load outs for a good version of either are totally different.  It‚Äôs better to run two separate characters and build specifically for one style or the other.  You‚Äôre not doing yourself any favors by trying to cram two different builds into one character.  
---
A great stealth build is really tight on perks as it is.  I could easily fill up 20 perk points each in perception, agility and luck, so being limited to 15 each requires some sacrifices and decisions on what benefits your play style most.
---
Just unlucky, I finally got the plans and rolled about 50-60 of them. I had 2 3-star ones, but had about 20 2-star. I think a 3 star has low chances but 2 star shouldn‚Äôt be all that difficult.
---
Damn that blows, I'll have to spend some time doing some research on what all the cards that play a role in both builds and then see if I can manage to fully mash them together
---
When you say heavy guns are you meaning lmg/.50 cal etc... or heavy in general?
---
Shouldn't be [TOO](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cc348b6&amp;d=lt2sg2sq2s32sr2ls2l71lu2eh2ce0ib4ip2x83pq1a04a12pe2pm2pj0cm2a72pa0p80p90&amp;w=pp2an2a51ar2pd2pk2pl2ss2se2s40sm0sn0ir2aj2li2cu0i30ia0i50) bad with the legendary perks out now. The problem is mostly syngery, as frankly speaking perception is pretty useless outside of rifle perks. I don't really like V.A.T.S either, so eh.
---
Nope. That's not a worry, that's a certainty. Pick a build and get good at it. Dial them perks in, all the way in. Then start another toon and try that other build.
---
Lol any American weapons instead of the boring fo4 weapon list would be amazing...
---
Seeing the R91 in the Mothman hunter begs the question if that is ever gonna return especially given how prevelent it actually is lore wise
---
You can..... I do a stealth commando/heavy gunner mix.
---
Do I recommend doing the same?  No, not really unless you are dead set on it.  Need to make too many sacrifices one way or another and your character would be more effective focusing on a single role.  It can be done though.
---
The ideal situation would be heavy in general with power armor whilst still being an effective sniper but from what people are saying it sadly seems impossible
---
Accuracy and durability are still garbage, which is something he doesn‚Äôt really discuss, but are significant factors when you use ts/e as your primary weapon.  Back when it was a 300% increase, I‚Äôd deal with it.  No way in hell for a few extra points.
---
its really frustrating that we are hitting more accurately without v.a.t.s.
---
I mean that sounds like a solid build, no idea why things are so difficult. I‚Äôve never tried a lever action before so I‚Äôm not sure how it handles overall. [Here‚Äôs a build I found on YouTube that hopefully will help.](https://youtu.be/_Co7mB83QBY)
---
I'm not bloodied.
---
I use instigating explosive rifles.
---
9 points in rifleman.
---
3 in covert ops for the extra 2.5 damage
---
5 in demolition adds back the damage that was taken away
---
3 in bloody mess
---
1 tenderizer
---
Tank killer, gun fu, concentrated fire, strange in numbers, grim reaper sprint maxed
---
4 in adrenaline
---
Using vats for the headshots gives better damage
---
I tear through west tek.   Even with non explosive instigating handmade its 2 shots max to a level 100 mutant
---
Sniper in general is doable. Sneak and heavy is a tough sell. As of the current game state PA is more like a car. You can use it just fine. But without legendary PA pieces it‚Äôs hindered some. 
---
If you could. Would settle for sniper with explosives? Mixed in with some sneak?
---
Damn, I'm already way too far into a sniper build to turn back. But I'm fine with that, this was just to entertain a thought
---
Can‚Äôt argue with that :)
---
Yeh all of them were 2 nights ago, all junk but nevertheless Ive collected enough scrip to last week's recently.
---
Low rate of fire weapons suck even more so now with the new "bAlAnCe" patch. 
---
The devs really dislike stealth builds, stealth hasn't had any new armor implemented since patch 8 (over a year ago, nearing two), you can't use stealth in ops or the new event, it's clear they don't want anyone to use it. 
---
Rifles also have received no love since patch 8, however they're not really in a bad shape. 
---
Vats is also in a terrible state but w/e. 
---
With that being said, I would still convert to a commando build of sorts, since you're more than likely already built for one, you just need to swap rifleman for commando perks. 
---
If you were going to do a complete respec, I'd consider Power Armor Heavy, since that is what all the content is being catered to.
---
The fallout 4 mod "Videos of the wasteland" added playable cartoons on holotapes and projectors. Twas amazing!
---
oh less than 2 days worth of bullion, how will I deal with that loss...
---
I'm running a BE build with demolition perks, commando, nerd rage etc. And I can kill the level 100s in about 3 or 4 shots. So if you can get your hands on a BE Handmade or Fixer something like that. I just shifted some cards around, didn't need to start a new character. I was pretty edgy about being bloodied at first but honestly, makes the gameplay very easy despite the increased death rate from low health. I love it. I hated the OW update too but now that I'm into the swing of it and know what to expect, it's no different to before for me really. Apart from the level 50 spawns instead of level 5s or 10s.
---
Fair enough
---
ye but sadly all only one star so all garbage
---
I have never played to one of the meta builds; i.e bloodied or junky. And it's crazy but I'm actually having an easier time since one wasteland came out. I also have a lever action rifle; however, it's really only useful at range, in stealth, with head shots. For the yao guais I use the slugs buster with the true flame attachment and it just melts them, and it utilizes the same perk points as the lever action. I dont need a magic or rare legendary to play the game, but I do have to pay closer attention to my perk card selection now. Atleast you can level up so fast now that if you need to respec a few perks iys bot that difficult.
---
Have you collected everything from your Scoreboard?
---
It was the perfect transportation system.  Fast, efficient and green.  But one day the unforeseeable happened and disaster struck! A stiff breeze!  The train car shot out of the loop right as the wind gusted hard enough to blow over a paper cup.  The unthinkable had occurred and the train smashed into the next pillar.  Dozens of people were now dead due to the freak weather incident!  At the same time on the ground, tragedy struck as the same destructive wind wreaked havoc on the unsuspecting masses and viciously knocked over a half full cup of coffee causing the black liquid to spill uncontrollably over nearby bystanders.  In the aftermath the survivors could only ask what capricious God could allow such a tragedy to happen.
---
Yes I have.
---
Makes no difference
---
Honestly I wouldnt mind just sniper without stealth, and then mixing that with heavy. But to answer your question I would prefer to not, explosives were never really my thing
---
with plasma gatling guns you can also give 300-500 ammo clips to your other weapons, but it's a bug, try switching between your plasma gatling gun and other weapons and see if it works
---
Post on bethesda forums plz
---
*shrug*.  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll fix it next patch.  Pobody‚Äôs Nerfect.  Especially not Bethesda.  :)
---
Bethesda - hire this lady/gent!
---
I‚Äòd love to see more themed rewards rather than nukashine etc goodies
---
Side note: I've never actually looked into sniper without sneak so I dont even know if its effective at all
---
Okay. Let me whip something up on nuke and dragons. Brb
---
I hope soon, my friend just copped on game pass and he‚Äôs having technical difficulties that I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt exist on other versions
---
Bloody Mess is a must-have perk. Also if you main a Gatling Gun, I would get the other Heavy Gunner perk cards. Running all those different things and trying to get the most out of them is going to be impossible. It‚Äôs up to you if you want to keep them and not do as much damage as you could or focus on one thing and maximize your output.
---
Sounds good, and thanks
---
Get the game on PC :-)
---
Might have been nuked before, the effects of a nuke zone keep lingering around for a bit after it vanishes.
---
East of Seneca Rocks, on the stretch of highway running north-south.
---
Posted my build in another comment. Modding a 10mm to auto and ysing swift mag, aligned barrel,aligned grip and 25% lower vats legendary effects makes it cosr about 1 AP per shot.
---
are these new assets? q lot has changed since  2018
---
its rng, just bad luck. im rolling for a unyielding secret service chest with ap refresh for about a month now, no idea how much scrip i sunk in it already, must the thousands.....just keep on repeating :)
---
You can do it with certain guns like the LMG which essentially will melt anything that quick you won't be detected, but as others say, the guns are very loud. 
---
My heavy main actually has maxed out sneak and sneak attack specifically for using the LMG whilst not in PA.
---
But while in PA there's pretty much no sneaking. 
---
Not sure if the stealth boy for PA is even useful as it uses a lot of AP.
---
It could be worse, I have made 50+ of them and never even got a one star with your preferred legendary. Plenty of one to three star junk like mutants and hunters though.
---
Absolutely amazing.
---
OK
---
JE legacies have super strong glitched "magic" damgic.
---
Even if it were the typical "Please stand by" broadcast would be nice. Maybe even make some tapes to load into the TV so it plays Vault Tech tutorial videos and old cartoons/opera/war documentaries
---
Yeah, there's loads been added since then. I use the double sided walls to decor the outside walls but a ton stuff been added through the atom shop stuff and also the legendary run rewards
---
Ye, but multi-shooting the same point of target. In this case - one shot means one kill
---
Yeah no. Ain't happening.
---
I completely agree! And in addition to this, if you are going to be an absolute asshole and grief people well we are doing the event, find another game to play. Just saying, nothing pisses me off more than trying to complete this event and someone with attention issues fails the event because they have Daddy issues. Get over yourself, this is a community event. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best! üëç
---
Yeah, piss off.  If I was going to make up a story, I'd come out like a hero instead of looking stupid for Nukashining to an area w/o wearing Power Armour and armed with a pre-Patch 22 nerf gun.
---
That would be cool, and when in doubt im sure theres plenty of creaters who would love to make videos for the game for free
---
 
---
You remind me of the babe (what babe?)  
---
The babe with the power (what power?)  
---
The power of voodoo (who do?)  
---
You do (do what?)  
---
Remind me of the babe
---
I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry  
---
What could I do?  
---
My baby's love had gone  
---
And left my baby blue  
---
Nobody knew  
---
What kind of magic spell to use  
---
Slime and snails  
---
Or puppy dog tails?  
---
Thunder or lightning  
---
Then baby said
---
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
---
Put that baby's spell on me  
---
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
---
Put that magic jump on me  
---
Slap that baby, make him free
---
My wife and I drop stuff for people all the time at events. When a random person joins out public team we offer them free mutations, ammo and chems if they want them. We also put a LOT of stuff in the mail box behind the bullion exchange in foundation. We call it the magic pie bush.
---
" Nuclear launch detected" 
---
Run to my weapons bench to make sure my weapons are good to go and there's Beckett drilling a hole in his hand. Try everything and he won't budge, so bloody frustrating. End up just leaving to the event. ACP is ok because it has benches there.
---
I have noticed some camps with multiple work benches and always thought it odd, but now it makes sense.
---
Try selling some of each item type. That way when someone looks st your camp they will see all if the items lit up, it makes your vending machines look more enticing. I have been selling stuff super quick since I've been keeping my machines stocked.
---
Junkie people- Magic peopleüòÇ
---
A short walk or a long walk? Makes all the difference.
---
Agreed
---
Other than the recent Atlas Provisions event which was essentially a junk exchange program, most the major events have actually been pretty decent. 
---
Meat week, Fasnacht, Mischief night, etc. 
---
Treasure hunters needed some tweaks to be more viable, it sounds like they've taken a lot of the feedback and adjusted for the new version about to drop so guess we'll see. I think there's still the potential to add a lot more to the event to flesh it out.
---
Honestly I'd even say adding a treasure hunter type event to NW would be a fitting use too. Have it spawn a random treasure hunter and all players on the map can try to find him and the one that kills them gets a brief super boost essentially making it a capture the flag mode giving the player that finds it some sort of 30 second God mode pacman for the player that finds it.
---
Cmon bruh
---
I like adrenaline
---
True but without video evidence with audio to confirm a trade was supposed to happen then they won't do anything. It's word against word otherwise.
---
Yes that is exactly it! It's pretty funny but damn hard to navigate
---
Nope, had to log out and back in to fix it
---

---
Here‚Äôs what I got. Non sneak sniper. You get 1-3 ranged shots off and swap to your heavy to finish the kill. If your luck and nail a headshot or body crit you can just sniper them dead. 
---
Bandolier because your going to be carrying a large supply of rounds. 
---
Perception is maxed out as that‚Äôs your core damage. 
---
Adamantium skeleton will keep your inside from becoming outsides. And chem fiend will help boost you when the fight is going to be long. 
---
Bodyguards and lone wanderer can be swapped if your solo. Strange in numbers is good to have unless solo
---
Gunsmith is a must
---
Action boy/girl is good for what it does
---
And luck is all flavour. 
---
Legendary perks and subjective so pick what you feel. I just went with what I find to be the most useful for snipers and rifleman in general. 
---
Weapons. I‚Äôd pick up either a lever action, .50 cal hunting rifle, handmade/assault rifle. Or combat/fixer. 
---
Heavy gun. The LMG is right now highly underrated. And with daily ops it‚Äôs golden for long battles. As long a you keep it feed. 
---
You can also use a laser/plasma rifle if your feeling bold. And a plasma flamer can do some serious damage when in the right fights.
---
I must admit I dont make a habit out of it but it was the first time I'd seen a hammock in a camp and wanted to try it out. Instant regret
---
When the new daily ops modes are implemented there are supposed to be some that will be catered to stealth builds. I think I read that in one of the inside the vaults or seen it in one of the dev videos
---
Does anyone know why I couldn't put my prime meat on the grill "you lack the something something"?
---
Also true, that's why I get people to message before going to a party. When you show interest in an LFG post then alot just immediately send party invite. I ignore it and wait for a Pm to get the ball rolling then I'll go to party once it's in writing lol. Only way to stay safe, if not using the market but that said I only use here now, well reddit. Even Facebook is full of scammers these days or just purely RMT pages.
---
Honestly, maybe is my internet, but just takes forever! What harm would be to have 10 available?
---
Even though you might not have any friends in the in game public teams, they're still great and you should definitely make use of them. Start your own if you dont want to be kicked though
---
I see people on the drums for hours straight sometimes. Or I assume they are, I see them still there between meat cooks sometimes
---
Not op, but I know my brother has a responders themed camp in the ash heap down the road from the tunnel. He wears the firebreathers outfit. I wonder if it's a stereotype for the people w/ camps there.
---
I do love these bugs, if I hadnt broken it so badly I would have definitely used to to mess with some other players
---
Yeah that was my thinking too. It seems like the most logical thing for Bethesda to do. Maybe a little bit bigger but definitely not the entire map.
---
I wish I could give you more upvotes.
---
Someone has been watching too much Labyrinth.
---
I think ash and goo piles should disappear when they are looted.  Why do "meat piles" disappear and not the other?
---
Yes, and that's a stupid idea. Let me be clear, making it so some builds are pointless in some ops, and not releasing all the varieties (so everyone has an op that they can do without being hindered) all at once is really, really stupid. 
---
Even moreso than the idea that that's ok in the first place. They're just punishing multiplayer play *even more so*. 
---
It's not like their plan for the "stealth" ops will punish non stealth anyway. They'll just hammer through it.
---
I'll usually take a copy of any plans I don't know when I see one if these drops and then add some of my own. It's like a lending library for plans but you don't get them back.
---
Here it is. Someone got through a glitch, so its got to be in the game files.

If you‚Äôre doing shit to AFK people, as much as they‚Äôre cunts, you aren‚Äôt contributing either.
---
You can't and have a functional build. You can do heavy/shotgun or sneak commando/rifle but mixing what you want isn't a viable build. You should just start a second character if you want that. I run a PA heavy and leveled another character for sneak command, that's the only way you can do it and have a functional build in both.
---
And the plasma defender as a skin for the pistol version too!
---
Yeah it all seems a bit...fruity to me.
---
You could also add Combat shotguns to your arsenal, especially with VATS perks. Auto it, and pull it out each time you get in a pinch. Highly recommend an AA version to deal a decent amount of damage. Check your misc section for Pleasant Valley claim tickets, and head to the basement of Pleasant Valley hotel, turn them in and see if you are lucky enough to score a Fancy Pump Shotgun, an awesome damage dealer, but as a pump action, slower than Combat shottys.
---
I want to wear bowies codpiece like a plague mask.
---
If I‚Äôm AFK in my camp and other people happen to be doing the prime cuts that spawns outside my house then I will happily benefit from it and not give a fuck. Sure, I get the occasional dick who tries to lure something up the stairs to kill me, but then it‚Äôs stopped by the fact they can‚Äôt jump over the barrier.
---
Yeah there seems to be so many missed opportunities with themed rewards this season. It's really strange. I thought they would have power patrol outfits as a minimum. For the board to be called "Armory Ace" and then have most of the rewards Commie themed is weird.
---
Thanks for doing this, I recently insta-died right at the end of a primal cuts w/ a bunch of springs from the yao guai. Some asshat looted my bag before I could even spawn back in.
---
What kind of magic gun to uuuuse
---
Strangler Heart
---
No because it makes the event unfun for everyone if u just do circles instead of doing drums as it will just fail
---
No I'm right there with you.
---
It's almost on the same level of stupid as this game not having a text chat that there isn't a matchmaking for Daily Ops.
---
Why would that be? I tend to gather a bucket of script over weeks and then craft?
---
And if you‚Äôre focused on them and not the event, you‚Äôre just as bad. Worse, in fact, for being a total dick when you could be doing the event.
---
xD You may be onto something!
---
When I was a noob, I was the same, didn't trust players as I thought they could kill you and steal whatever they wanted, I avoided high levels like the plague lol
---
They are just jelly someone beat them to it so they can't afk on the drums.
---
Nothing like a bit of Bowie in tights. üëåüèª
---
I know how you feel, yesterday I had to server hop a good 10 times to find a daily ops team actually doing daily ops, and I rarely ever find an events team doing events. The daily ops is helping me farm the 5.56 I need so I'd repeat it as often as possible if needed. I dont mind helping out others, plus the extra stimpaks can sell for quite a lot
---
soon this damage will ch-ch-ch-change
---
I‚Äôm trying to roll an assassins powered reduce falling damage secret service right arm, so if the first piece I get is zealots, I save my modules for another time. 
---
It‚Äôs odd, it‚Äôs supposed to be RNG but sometimes there‚Äôs a pattern.
---
That would be freakin sweet thankyou for sharing
---
As long as you do the Magic dance, and put that baby's spell on me, you can use whatever one your heart desires!
---
Holy shit man that's amazing, genuinely thanks for putting in so much effort for some random kid
---
Switch on pacifist mode.
---
Much thanks for the tip! I always disliked the camouflaged ops cause of this üòî
---
Least know I know how they all feel when I‚Äôm in stealth Armor in main game üòÜ
---
I would love some skins for the grenade launchers. They need more love.
---
I‚Äôve picked up two 3* armour pieces with nearly identical prefixes from some of the legendary enemies so it‚Äôs well worth it.
---
We NEED a Bowie outfit just to play that song whilst using some good ole magic
---
It's especially frustrating when you now that one of those covered piles has a legendary. This has happened to me a couple of times each in Uranium Fever and Radiation Rumble when the piles get thick.
---
how do I do meat without hud
---
It would be nice but it's technically been on the same day in game since launch, October 23 I believe.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Me and my friends have tried this extensively.
---
Solar armour, what rads, couple perks that help at low health,  I last quite well....
---
 Turn and face the strange xD
---
If you'd like a buddy to do stuff with add me mate. I play UK time evenings. APEXnova34
---
I've been checking these when I visit the stations and haven't really seen anything in them. Then again I only really visit the one station by Morgantown which might not get as much high-level traffic as say the whitespring one.
---
The most efficient way to do the silo is to put on the Chinese Stealth Suit and simply avoid all of the enemies.  It's not great gameplay but until they change it, it's faster than gunning everything down at least.
---
Thank you all who came to help out but after so many answers I believe I've gotten all that I've needed. Again thank you all, this was all very helpful.
---
Good fun when you're swimming around and suddenly swimming in the air
---
They mentioned doing something for Christmas, doubt it'll be snowy though, the game struggles to render environments at the moment without snow on top
---
oh man, i forgot about that damn mayor. "Who else would it be?!"
---
Not if you know what you are doing.
---
Or explosives, even if it's something like an hour for 1 mininuke. I just want to make more things go boom.
---
I have the Grim Reaper Vault Boy cutout plan from last years Halloween event which could be rare as this years event in canceled, 20k caps, Asylum worker uniform green, Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet level 50 50% limb damage - damage increase as health decrease - 90% reduced weight, Instigating minigun level 45 bullets explode - double damage if target is full health - 90% reduced weight.
---
I also have this, but a fix i use is when you load into a game, go onto the map and on menu, then go to the scoreboard, it works for me.
---
It's the beam splitter, it basically makes it a shotgun, so yeah magic shotgun blah blah we all know how OP they are...
---
I love Daily ops, though the first ever one sucked, especially when people werent really used the damage changes, but now it's pretty great, even just for ammo farming, and you can get good caps turning in the stimpaks (or a good feeling giving them to lobbies if the vendors are out of caps) might have to start using heavies in there to get my 50 cal ammo up. I really hope they expand on this, cant wait to see what new locations and enemies theyll add in future
---
If people spent a tenth of the time they spend bitching about AFKers then they could complete the entire game and roll their god rolled weapons and armor all by their lonesomes.
---
Just did it! Hopefully in the right thread. "known issus and feedback"
---
Lever-Actions did get hit pretty hard with the calculation change, however you should still be able to clear meat weak whilst targeting weak-points. 
---
Have you tried using something with a little faster fire rate? Like a Handmade, Combat Rifle, Laser Rifle, Plasma Rifle? 
---
Just for testing purposes of course, I'm not saying throw the Lever-Action away, those things are a tonne of fun to use.
---
I think the saddest part about this post is that people are actively downvoting David Bowie :(
---
Well I'm not going to disagree with you. In all of the fallout games ( from 3 to present) I have played a stealth build. Partially because I have never really liked power armor. But in 76 it is really difficult to play stealth and most of the time if I want to survive I have to wear power armor. But I'm also a casual player, though I like playing 76, I'm really not that great at it. I have seen other players though who utilize a stealth commando build and are amazing at it.
---
Yes I found him in the mire, he scans you and calls you "commander" and yeah he follows you, I had an issue though where some blood eagles attacked and he wiped them out (I didnt engage them cause that sentry was just awesome to watch). I went to loot them when out of nowhere I got killed by a missile, upon respawning he was hostile to me and was just going mad with missiles and mortars
---
Nice. I changed my build today to go from 13 INT to 40 INT.
---
I noticed the difference üòÅ.
---
It's a shame that some people  don't realize how much the drums and spits help. You can start the event with 2/3s of the bar filled if 6 people are doing them.
---
Because some of us find it fun. I enjoy the unbalanced nature of it personally as it makes every encounter random and non predictable. While yes some guns are just broken and quantum spam is a thing, if you run into someone playing like that you can just dip out. Easy.
---
Plus at least on xbox its not as common as what ppl think. 1 out of 20 players I pick a fight with use that type stuff and even last night this other player asked if I wanted him to use normal stuff or broken. I told him broken to test my tankyness lol but he offered.
---
I find more nice pvp players then what reddit likes to make you believe and find more rude or toxic pve players that loose thier minds and go into a rage if i kill them. I have be called all types of names for simply using workshops as thry are intended its ridiculous.
---
No problem. I enjoy making builds.
---
Herbivore and carnivore with boost cranberry relish and tasty squirrel bits to 25%. And brain bombs boiled scorched beast brain to +8 int. Also egg head, +3 int on a team
---
Well, it‚Äôs obvious neither of us is going to budge. 
---
As to survival mode, I honestly don‚Äôt remember them removing the leaderboard. Though I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm being disingenuous. I can only assume that was pretty close to the end. 
---
Really, I think our being at loggerheads is because of this: you believe that the issues with PVP only became evident over time, whereas I believe they were evident from day one. You believe people didn‚Äôt want to PVP because they were used to Fallout being a PVE game, whereas I believe they either had a taste and were put off by the issues or were just plain irritated by systems like slap damage. If your statement was just that PVP wasn‚Äôt popular, then sure. Agreed. We‚Äôre butting heads because of the ‚Äòwhy.‚Äô  
---
On the leaderboard mistake you were correct, but there‚Äôs nothing ignored about the second point. We‚Äôre just operating from fundamentally different conceptions, and for that reason I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ever going to agree. So in the interests of sanity, this might be one of those ‚Äòagree to disagree‚Äô moments before we get stuck in ever descending Reddit reply quicksand.
---
Does the vendor have any new camp plans?
---
I love right there too, it‚Äôs nice having a 2 cap fast travel to Berkeley station instead of 15 cap travel up to the other station, I‚Äôm a penny pincher tho lol
---
Replace hard bargain with 3* tenderizer and turn on bargain only when you're doing your daily sales. Also if you're running a heavy in PA and not taking stabilized, you're missing out on major perk. Keeping Tesla for swarms or event tagging is fine but it won't ever be a highest tier damage weapon, keeping a strong melee weapon on you is good but maybe the new Gutter plan would be a better fit depending on the rolls on the one you have but again without spec perk for melee it will always be a backup weapon and not main damage. 
---
One of the big changes to 76 vs earlier solo play Fallout is that you're never going to be the master of all weapons super damage machine and still have quality of life perks. Only you can find the balance that works for you but due to limited slots you will have to pick smart and keeping on perks that you barely use or not focusing on a single weapon class for your main source of damage perks will be incredibly limiting.
---
Junk and water, train station a run away. I was a tad anoyed they put people at the village, the anglers and occasional fog crawler was great xp, but if they're gona do something with it, even better!
---
Like vehicles that yo-yo back if you only hit them once or twice.
---
I'm level 30 and It was so much fun, conquering the wasteland near the vault, and do easy events. Now, I  can't even do big damages to an enemy because thex are lvl 30 as well.
---
I've got some legendary handmades in my stash, I'll check if there's anything useful in there. Thanks.
---
That's Vendor Bo Wallace. He was moved from Harper's Ferry.
---
Afaik is that the vendor that used to be at Harpers Ferry before. I don't know why he moved, but there is non in Harpers Ferry now.
---
So it sucks because it's not easy any more?
---
Ok.
---
Yessir.
---
I would counter by saying they should get rid of lone wanderer or re tool it to be more about being outnumbered or some such in a certain proximity or some such. 
---
Just alot of character growth left on the table by not being grouped.
---
Buy a Plasma Gatling from Whitespring, get the Heavy Gunner perks and you have a viable build. Then do Beckets missions for a 50cal.
---
Don't want heavy guns? Railway Rifle is a decentish Commando/Rifleman weapon - get the plan from Free States Vendor. 
---
Melee? Get All Rise and then get as much strenth and melee bufffood as possible. 
---
Just don't use a 15 level old 1 star legendary you have no perks for.
---
I'll have a go at commando, thanks for the tip!
---
Ah! These are great suggestions! Thanks man.
---
Gotcha. Tbh, had I not lucked out finding the plan for sale I was about to go T-65.
---
He was one of the only robot vendors not in a station... Maby murmrgh never owned it in the first place
---
That's a good INT stat. Unyielding? And what else?
---
I remember dropping stims for some new guys and they said no. Lol.
---
We need a stickied post for these
---
It's definitely possible but you need to play the game a long time to get all the SPECIAL points required to be great at both. I'm working towards a build with 15 strength &amp; perception, high agility and luck(using legendary cards) . I'm on level 300+ and its going to take a while longer to get where i want to be.
---
So I didn't team up for ages... don't seem to play well with others and happy to do my own thing. 
---
I finally found the benefits of being in a team and actively join teams now. When I log on I check the daily op and then make a decision, if it's exploding mutants I am all over it but those frigging robots just suck. 
---
I will not join a Daily Ops team if I have no interest, that is unfair to people wanting to get it done. I will happily make a casual team and wait for others to join me, I am fine with that.
---
Stealth commando is usually pretty great, I personally run bloodied stealth commando. I always forget to give them credit (probably because I so rarely use it), but the chinese stealth suit was a very nice upgrade so that we didn't have to don power armor to go into a nuke zone for the queen if you felt like throwing ammo away for some reason. 
---
The issue is they're shaping the content, both in gear and things to do for non-stealth users. I'd love to have easy access to armor like SS, instead of having to play the the mole praying for a jackpot. 
---
If they start punishing all builds, like say making it so heavy weapons do 10% damage in events and ops, that'll be interesting. But right now it looks like they only wish to restrict stealth, and will be tossing them a bone where stealth will, *gasp*, work in an op. 
---
Which will just be steamrolled by the other builds.*
---
*Unless the enemies are so tough that they are meant to not be engaged, well, that just means you get to sneak around but not do combat. Which removes most, arguably all, of the stealth build. Since the point of stealth *isn't* to never fight.
---
I‚Äôm level 55 I think, I played when it released and just came back so I‚Äôm still figuring everything out. My gt is iiExtravagent
---
I see this happen a lot. 
---
I can remember doing the meat week months ago and I observed someone on the drums, they were on the drums even when the event had finished and there when the event restarted. 
---
It makes every event harder for those trying to complete it, also more enemies get spawned in for more players taking part. 
---
I also wished that survival tents were not allowed immediately in active areas where you get rewarded for completing events.
---
100%. They even removed slap damage.
---
If you want to snipe with no sneak buff damage you must really hate yourself.. and no, an hybrid heavy/sniper would be really bad cause are two totally different builds.. one is strenght oriented the other is per/agi/luck
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs just random. Hopping servers or doing it another time is the same as moving over two seats at the slot machines in a casino. Most the time when I craft legendaries, almost all of them are three stars. I have gotten only a couple of one stars and almost exclusively when Super Duper has taken effect.
---
With every buff I can add. I am going for carnivore now. I only started looking in to this today. I am way behind everyone else....
---
It‚Äôs actually possible with the legendary perk system, you‚Äôd just have to switch out your agility perks whenever you‚Äôre wanting to switch to a stealth build.
---
Been thinking lately that this game serves more so as a sort of power fantasy for people badly wanting to own their own personally furnished home.
---
Have long had a dream of getting some farm land and making an art studio then creating a haunted house attraction too.
---
Something mannequin themed to tap into the void Silent Hill left bn in my life when Konami ran it into the ground. 
---
I even designed up some haunted mannequin concepts on my website. 
---
https://www.studio-aegis.com/mannequin-haunt.html
---
Sadly my artistic following isn't yet high enough to bolster my income enough to make it a reality. 
---
But it is an unyielding dream.  :p
---
How many of you would gladly brave radioactive water to live in your own camps made reality?
---
Thank goodness you can at least kill some stuff while you wait! üòÖ
---
To be honest I disagree with you that the lower level areas shouldn't level with you, it meant that once you reached a certain point there was no point going to lower level areas as enemies gave rubbish exp and gear, nothing worse than getting a awesome legendary and it being low level.
---
I‚Äôll use the one that reminds me of the babe
---
think about going the full dmg with one weapon class.
---
so if you want to go heavy weapons go with all the heavy weapon perks at max and use stabilized under intelligence for armor penetration.
---
pa is perfect for trying out a bloody build btw, because you dont need to farm any armor. just get a 1\* bloody heavy gun like your gatling gun, check out the bloody pa builds and have fun.
---
For the love of Thra please make it so
---
Thank you for offering.
---
I'll keep looking!
---
What babe? ;)
---
Burrows would likely be a good place if they fox their respawns.
---
Took some friends there for their first time and was very disappointed to see that most of them were already dead.
---
If you're level 100 and are running both full charge and power user, how many fusion cores have you amassed? I'm at around 30 on all of my PA characters, without bothering to pick up partial cores, and none of them use those perks. I would skip both of those in favor of damage related perks. Stabilized in intelligence and the heavy weapon perks in strength. If you are carrying a lot of them, putting a couple more points into Batteries Included will save you more weight than pack rat and sturdy frame combined.
---
I wondered where he‚Äôd gone! I thought my server had glitched and he hadn‚Äôt loaded. Awesome news, but I did like having him in Harper‚Äôs Ferry to offload my 18 combat rifles from the Scorched
---
I was there for ages when the Purveyor was still there, just south of the station by a cliffside. Great CAMP spots round there, so atmospheric
---
Nah internet said it just works is fun fun word so we don't give fuck about what it is about just follow hivemind "It JuSt WorKS LolOLOLO"
---
If you drop it on the ground it‚Äôs free real estate. I like to keep the wasteland ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù no room for the weak. Don‚Äôt batter me with ‚Äúyou were low level once too‚Äù BS stories. I made it cause I could, not everyone should, nor can, nor should it be easy. Easy times create weak waste landers. 9/10 people feel the same way but won‚Äôt admit it, you know your ruthless, you know you like stomping out the lights of the weak.
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for someone smarter than me to crack the collectron dupe and make it public.
---
Man exiting and reentering VATs rarely works for me.
---
Often find that I just need to keep firing and eventually itll decide to stop having the rounds curve around the enemies.
---
And you don't see a problem with their expectation that high level players are a free repair service? That's not just an error correction, it calls for a full reality check.
---
Yeah, I keep seeing this advice to swap out rifleman for commando and go full automatic. I guess it‚Äôs good advice if you like automatic weapons but I am not a fan. It just seems to me that more than a small handful of builds should be viable. I have a full set of three*legendary SS armor and those damn bears still wipe me out in two swipes at lvl 166.
---
Sneak dude, you need to have a good sneak build if you‚Äôre going for Rifleman, 2.5x ranged damage. I switched to Commando just before One Wasteland and still ruin level 100 muties if I‚Äôm sneak. I abandoned my melee build as it was boring
---
[Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=313413b&amp;d=sg2eh2cm2ce0a12la2l71lu2lg2&amp;m=9e87b) are the perks and mutations you'll want to focus on for survivng better.
---
In order, I'd probably focus on: Empath/Mutations(Strange in Numbers+Starched Genes+Class Freak), Blocker, Serendipity, Dodgy, Fireproof, Richochet, and then Suppressor.
---
Empath is pretty big on the list because it affects every single person in your party including yourself regardless of whether or not they have the mutation. So that's pretty much a flat -25% damage for everybody. Blocker cuts all that melee damage that killing you in one hit in half. Serendipity gives you a 50% to dodge all damage when below 20% HP, it's massive for staying alive as it can give you more time to use a stim. Dodgy allows you to reduce incoming damage by 30% at the cost of 30 AP per hit, it's a useful skill but it will drain your AP extremely quickly. Fireproof cuts explosive and fire damage in half it's a less common form of damage, so it's lower on the list. Richochet gives you a 18% chance to completely ignore ranged damage it's kind of expensive for what it does so it's low on the list. Suppressor reduces the attack output of your target by 30% for 2 seconds this is low on the list because it only affects the targets you are actively attacking, but it's still a potent effect.
---
Personal opinions on them, I use all of them. Sometimes I'll toss in Ghoulish instead of Fireproof as some monsters will tend to do rad damage with their attack with which Ghoulish can actually heal you for more than the damage you take from the attack. It really mitigates the threat of certain enemy types.
---
Radaway isn't just for new playersü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Sounds about right
---
Gt: yehrightdude
---
Agree but when the event starts, staying on the drums insted of collecting meat is pointless
---
The babe with the power X)
---
Yeah I‚Äôm super impatient so it sucks not knowing when it will be on sale but there is like no way I‚Äôm spending $40 on it
---
What power? :P
---
Perhaps they're doing it and letting others pick them up, like a production line?  
---
I see this done at path to enlightenment, people collecting the glowbug bits, drop them at the entrance of the lighthouse - it's pretty efficient.
---
Yeah since one wasteland I have switched over to an exclusively shotgun build. I have a nice magic shotgun but I only used to pull out in case of emergencies but it is basically my main weapon now. It used to one shot almost everything but boss level stuff, but now Even magic, a lot of things and take 2 to 5 shots.
---
 I did just that the other night, had to run to the loo. Got back and someone was shooting at me, angry and thumbs down emoting.
---
Level 40, skipped all of NW challenges so far, been gaining a lot of score through experience though. ü§ô
---
It‚Äôll be under a basic fridge if you already have one, it‚Äôs a variant. Took me ages to find the Lodge Couch as apparently it‚Äôs a variant of the Red Rocket diner bench...I wish there was a ‚Äúrecently unlocked‚Äù filter, or just Atom Shop stuff.
---
Least you got a mod that you'll need for it later. 
---
I'm the idiot who bought a power armor left leg instead of the secret service left leg.  XD
---
You can use mine. Lemme check another server quick. Looking for a serum after I'll hit you up.
---
You amazing soul
---
Just sent a friend request, jump in!
---
I either do that or do what I've learned playing an archer: jump, enter vats and shoot.
---
They don‚Äôt drop if you already know it, maybe it‚Äôs bugged and you can already build it? It‚Äôs stupid and Im probably wrong, but it‚Äôs worth double checking the craft menu in case something‚Äôs gone weird
---
I'm did this with the first [character](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ed33e45&amp;d=pp2ic4lt2i12s12eh2ip2sq2s32sr2sb2s01pd2pk2pl2p60an2ao0cu2xm3x42x82l71ar2xp1ls2&amp;w=s72&amp;m=f3&amp;n=Heavy%20Rifleman) I created. It works pretty well as long as you're not planning on using VATS. One thing to note, I used to use a two-shot explosive lever action backed up by an instigating black powder rifle, but after the update they're not very viable. I've switched to an instigating gauss rifle and am back to killing in one shot. I've also switched to full-time power armor since one wasteland, which still works reasonably well for stealth because at sniper ranges you're tougher to detect.
---
It's a pretty convenient build - the gauss rifle is very ammo efficient, so I can kill lots of normal enemies and loot their weapons for steel to make rounds for my .50 cal.
---
Whoooh, how often does that work??
---
This is basically the build I had before patch 22. I had mostly sneak and rifleman perks with a couple of heavy gunner perks for big boss battles, but it was completely wrecked by the latest patch.
---
Yep!
---
It just happened! I read this post and thought "Ya know what? I'm go drop some stuff in front of Vault 76 for new players". I finished the cookout and went to drop some more and there was a lvl 170 player who grabbed my previous stuff and ran. FFS
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Maybe they could make a new tab on the start up, play , private ,one wasteland and nuclear winter?
---
I wish we could bulk screws as well. I have 9k sitting in my scrapbox since the ACP event started. It would make it easier to sell them to vendors instead of taking 500 individual screws at a time.
---
No new stealth armor? The Chinese stealth suit damn near broke the game.
---
Lv50 with a je plasma? That isn't no noob XD
---
Be cool if you could put a level cap on a particular vending machine, doesn't seem like it'd be that hard.
---
He was completely clueless it couldn‚Äôt be faked
---
I can‚Äôt wait to unlock infiltrator level 4 
---
These Nuke runs will be so cheap ammo wise I‚Äôll be doing them left right and centre 
---
Flux for everyone
---
Not a lot of people seem to go to grafton these days and it‚Äôs a proximity pop event. 
---
Also if you go straight to the monster and one shot it that‚Äôs event over I believe so many people (me included) don‚Äôt see it unless I happen by.
---
Yeah, you could definitely do it, but it will probably take a while.  You'll need to take some of the new special boosting legendary perks to be able to fit all the perk cards you'll want.  This probably will take several hundred levels.  I would start with one build and then once you've got the legendary cards down then think about developing the other side.  My current main uses multiple weapon types (Pistols, Explosives and Auto Rifles) and i do just fine.
---
I somehow have  never had a problem with these creatures.
---
But man every other creature in the game seems capable of 1 shotting me when I forget to swap out of my crafting perks.
---
Don‚Äôt be a rat
---
I have a two shot ffr and it does shoot faster. I like it, but I prefer my furious explosive because of the explosion effect
---
Cool base good work
---
That would be nice! I feel like having a vending machine is a bit less intrusive than chasing them theough the Foresf and shooting at a loot bag.
---
I'd probably switch to my Final Word when she's flying to try and cripple a wing (I think you can do that again). If im going to waste ammo, might as well make the easy to craft stuff!
---
I've had such bad luck with legendary drops lately. I got a couple of good ones from Uranium Fever, but that was before One Wasteland so the level was capped. I think I've gotten like 5 bone clubs this week. Its ridiculous.
---
Got a few of these, they slay in VATS. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I use sneak as every day and heavy weapons in Daily Ops. Bit of fiddling and experimenting with perk layout. It can be done. I can give more details if you like. Not running fallout at the moment. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks sorted me out for a direction.
---
They and hurt you unless you are engaged in PvP. It doesn‚Äôt mitigate any damage if you are in a workshop (ie engaged in PvP). I really don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. They can shoot you all they want outside of a workshop and do zero damage unless there is an exploit.
---
All the time. First gauss I used was the shotty. Then I noticed the charging time was similar to the bow. The I used the same trick of jumping, entering vats and releasing the arrow/shot. You can miss but it is a LOT less. But I only play in first person.
---
Can't anyone start the op regardless? 
---
I'll join an op team, and even if there's one other person on the team not currently in a daily I'll start it up. It takes 6-7 minutes tops for me to run it... Then I close out, and either run it again or just move on.
---
People are getting too hurt about this event and the team option for the required time investment.
---
Man I accidentally destroyed a medics explosive fixer yesterday that I was giving to a friend.
---
We were both mortified. 
---
Please just make it so that the items skin is removed upon drop. Or just straight up force us to remove the skin ourselves.  Have never wanted to just destroy a legendary beyond using a scrip machine.
---
You know they eventually disapear and you can visit the place 15 min later and get your loot as long as its not an instance zone
---
Where did he get it?
---
Instead we get Nuka Shine.. 
---
*yay*
---
Why would a level 50 need a gun repaired?
---
Some random guy I suppose. I‚Äôve had similar luck in the past. Too bad the guy I had was a crossbow fan;-;
---
Haha, yes! One of them had the gall to wait for me to restock it and then emptied it again. I followed them back to their camp, used the gift emote, and dropped some digested goo  raw fertilizer, and a couple of notes ("Warning" + "You're the Dumbass")
---
Anyone can start it, doesn't have to be team leader
---
All it'd take is for a BoS officer to talk to MODUS, the second MODUS finds out about what the BoS did (Deserted from the US army) and what their values are, they're as good as dead.
---
Probably store-bought
---
You need wasteland whisperer to tame one of those. And it needs to have spawned alone to a random encounter spot.
---
shoulda kept them...they're pretty darn valuable in trades
---
He was completely clueless and like 15
---
I would definitely pay for it.
---
Definitely not, why would he be so willing to drop it for me then? He had no idea how much it was worth.
---
Thats nuts one of the most powerful guns out there and he couldn't even repair it dammnn lol. Definitely bought the gun or account with cash because I refuse to believe you can get to lv50 and trade for that gun without learning the basics.
---
Like explosive legendary or like a grenade launcher? The legendary can be silenced on most guns. A grenade launcher not so much.
---
Ugh...yet another problem with this game.
---
Folks just running around with legacies.....
---
The power of voodoo
---
I guess I was slightly ahead of the changes for patch 22, but I changed my build to shotguns once I scored the Fancy, and haven't really noticed too much in changes, with the obvious exception of higher level enemies taking a shot or two extra to kill.
---
He told me it was dropped for him and that‚Äôs it, he had no idea what he was doing. He showed me his perks and that how I knew he was clueless, he had like 3 commando perks a random rifleman perk equipped and like 8 strength. He was a complete newbie with insane luck
---
I'm not seeing better legendaries, just tougher enemies.  Which I don't mind, but it should mean better rewards.  I am seeing more maintenance for armor and weapons though.
---
really don't know why they added a static spawn for this. It would've been coveted otherwise.
---
Who do? xD (This song is now stuck in my head)
---
I do agree with that. I‚Äôd say they should freaking rework explosive energy. Or wipe me out of the game
---
I use explosive bullets for all weapons with silencer (not using shotgun) and I have sneak build. I use the Escape Artist and Covert Ops last. Escape Artist is great. Give an oggly a dirt nap and his friends look around wondering why.
---
YOU DO! Hehehe
---
Now that I can believe then XD good on you for being kind I know a lot of people would be tempted to scarpper with that
---
Just delete them... it would save a lot of time and energy.
---
More the fact they are your level the legendaries. Found a 3 star be minigun once, lv 35 :(
---
Deep Pockets for arms and ultralight for legs
---
Nope. Tried it.
---
I've fired an M1 Garand irl and goddamn that thing has some kick, it was really accurate though. I'm not a good shot bc I've only gone to the range a few times, but I was able to hit a target at about 100 yards.
---
To avoid this, invite to noob for trading and then put a price 0 on the item
---
I think you need at least 5 prime meats before you can add them
---
Yeah I spent like an hour telling him he should just make a rifleman build or make a new character. The dude was out damaging me and (albeit I was in the midst of a respec)
---
I tried this yesterday and it didn't work for me.
---
Also, just in case you are wondering, Stealth Boys don't work, either.
---
That‚Äôs awesome where all did you guys go? I‚Äôm born and raised West Virginian. I‚Äôm out of Charleston.
---
That or just give them the same property as the gauss mini gun pistol and shotgun. And for the flamer... idek what you would do for that in all honesty
---
I've got rank 2 in covert operative so 2.3x instead of 2.5x.
---
Anyone else unable to get the 11 agility and 14 luck? I have respec‚Äôd into the other special point. Any advice?
---
 Theres a reason those legacy weapons are like gold dust ;)
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous you‚Äôre supposed to contribute it brings the bar up some ppl are just idiots
---
If anything I should‚Äôve taken itXD at least I‚Äôd be able to realize it‚Äôs full potential
---
The Garand and M14 were both in fallout tactics.. wont lie tactics had a nice spread of weapons to choose from
---
Yeah, I wouldn't really mind if they had separate servers for One Wasteland and one without One Wasteland. But that'll never happen because we already have 3 icons in that menu and that's like the holy number.
---
I have a Similar issue with my Nuka Cola machine. There is a sign that clearly states TAKE ONE but people will come and just empty it out. I have mitigated this issue by adding the occasional Nukashine. However, I feel bad for the odd person that comes by and follows the rules, but gets shined on the first sip lol.
---
I sold 600 stims to the trader in the last 2 weeks just to dump weight.  Everyone was low level once and most of the high levels have spare stuff they're more than willing to dump on a low level
---
Yeah it was pretty fun before patch but half the time the vats would miss. So I never used it much. If vats would actually hit when it says 98 percent then the thing would be amazing
---
Do you mean so that everybody who has issues since One Wasteland can go to 1 place for help/information/ranting or is this just a sneaky way of saying that you're tired of seeing posts like this?
---
Yeah, it's just not the hacked in weapons that are present on console, duped weapons are very much a thing across all platforms.
---
Yeah happened a lot yesterday but then I just jumped into my own made team and went to daily op. Someone ended up joining when I was at fist uplink. So we got elder first run. But I know a lot of ppl will stay in group but not run it. Once I run it and am done doing daily ops I leave and join another group or make a casual group.
---
The only problem is the bull barrel sucks, its just a worse version of some of the already existing barrels. Looks cool tho
---
I do like the idea of there being uber items for people to trade up for, imagine if they completely removed them the trading market would collapse as there wouldn't be much stuff to work for. They are great but realistically speaking from my own view of playing you dont really see them that much, if anything there's fixers here there and everywhere XD I feel sorry for poor melee players trying to get a hit on before the fixers start tut tutting.
---
There isn‚Äôt much for the arms, If you don‚Äôt go jet pack then get Dense, you can then get rid of fireproof.
---
If you use a lot of AP comfort fit for the legs is useful
---
Ah i thank you
---
I think we might be friends in the game! Unless there are a lot of responder firemen with cool camps w a free machine in the ash heap... Somehow I doubt that.
---
There are some wolves amongst the sheep. Overall it's a very cooperative group. You get more good than bad....
---
Yes. I'm no shotgunner so it's no use. But nice.
---
I'll take it if I see it. I don't care if you die or not, part of the game. Go in your own server if your are worried about that kind of stuff. -raider out
---
Honestly 2 level 100+ with a decent build can do it in well under 8 mins, anyone extra at that point is a bonus
---
It's the first gold thing I bought. It's the first Vault 94 item I crafted.
---
lmao i do it with the jetpack rubber band from so many people. feels like super man cannon Balling from orbit.
---
Most of us can solo daily ops without too much difficulty.
---
Doing it in less than 8 minutes is the hard part: By yourself it's basically impossible without magic weapon shenanigans, simply because the beacons take so long to finish. Even with perfect beacon times you're left with about 45 seconds to kill a whole bunch of enemies and then fight the boss.
---
Just *one* other person near the beacon makes all the difference, even if they're not shooting.
---
It triggers two shot weapons in the same way as it does shotguns, just not as damaging.
---
It also triggers heavy guns, if you get an anti armor heavy gun you don't have to worry about getting power armor for stablized!
---
Very interested in PVP. I agree it is highly inaccessible.
---
People who don't want it are just blind to the idea that this game can be more than what it is - shoot, loot, dailies, log out. Theyre too accustomed to the slow pace RPG that the other titles offered, snd miss being God. What if there was real incentive to interact with other players?
---
This game isn't going to last longer than their 10 year plan without PVP, and we're going nowhere fast without it.
---
Does it work with Adrenaline or Gun Fu?
---
Just go to events , you‚Äôll get lots of opportunities to revive an ally
---
nope !
---
Well I barely goto primal anymore but I did last night and that stupid 3 star mole rat I killed I searched with my camera out for 40 minutes and still never found it. So now I know it prob was a god roll weapon lol. Stupid fucking mole rats
---
If there are players working the spits and drums prior to the official start of the event you can get the progress bar to nearly complete by the time the event starts and complete it in around 30 seconds after the actual start.
---
I mean if you need it, you need it but I‚Äôm willing to bet those high levels are just trying to sell them for 30 caps each
---
I'm so bored with that event that's all I do is either get on the drums or turn the meat.
---
Mostly agree, but if enough fires/mess build up the bar starts dropping even with people on the drums/spits. There's times I've felt I had to jump off a drum, go put out a load of fires, then get back on it.
---
Yes! It is happening. And some also shows up with no loot even have tagged them for sure.
---
If you nuke it, they will come.
---
Spoilers ahead!:
---
The Treehouse Village NPCs are going to have a role in Steel Dawn - the Treehouse Settlers are at war with the Blood Eagles - Treehouse civvies call the Brotherhood of Steel for support - which means us. One of the rewards is supposedly the Bubble Turrets - best reward to be able to snag that's for sure.
---
Just let me know if im in your way...
---
Way to use Onomatopoeia XD but I agree with that point, it‚Äôs probably why they are locking you out of being able to trade all the new weapons coming out (war glaive, wastlanders gauss weapons etc)
---
Don't forget the Herb I mean Herd Mentality
---
They just added ultralight for the limbs. I‚Äôm a stealth commando so I went with that for the AP benefits
---
Workshops are dedicated PVP zones. If pacifist protected you, that would be an exploit
---
The leader can actually change it after the op. Not doing so is lazy.
---
why would it be, you need to get gear and lvl up as well. 
---
it all good as long as you do what you have to.. mainly stay near the beacon, move to next beacon, stay there
---
It's always been empty for me.
---
Nope, the daily ops are easy as heck. I'll gladly take any level to do daily ops with.
---
A few times I‚Äôve gone for this week, all I got was prime meat, and the large prime beast wasn‚Äôt a legendary. So there wasn‚Äôt any real incentive for me to waste the ammo.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why they are doing it.
---
Blame the dupers...kind of ruined it for the rest of us. Got great SS rolls....but not for my build.
---
I just want to hear that Christmas jingle again before I kill those scorched.
---
That‚Äôs rough ;-; I have the war glaive but I got it unlocked for my heavy build and not my melee build :(
---
Uh go back to 1998
---
Herbivore. Herd Mentality. Brain bombs. Cran Relish. Berry Mentats. Uny +Int armor. Then there's magazines and bobbleheads but I don't collect those.
---
XD flashback to my melee days when I would go to tag a legendary then that bloody noise and it died nearly instantly, surprised I didn't start getting nightmares nooooo not the tut tut. Speaking of new stuff coming out I am a bit gutted I'm missing out on mischief night didnt get the chance last year
---
Glad we cleared that up then.
---
I ran Silo Bravo two nights ago and nuked the mine. Ran to the mine, wondering where everyone was, finally dropped inside, still no-one! Hmm... ARGGHH, forgot I had switched to a private server to claim a workshop... Earle did not have a worry in the world...
---
The game is hard for new players. I see them dropping legendaries and armor.. like dude, sell and scrap sell and scrap! I remember starting off and I hated it honestly. That was at beta, wonder how it is now with them scaling.
---
It was so hard for them to get black titanium screws.. bro, here's a hundred. Enjoy.
---
Lol watch out though if you join the groups they will kick you I had to wait till level 52 in my own op before I got to play
---
lol, that was fun... well not so fun as interesting and a nice surprise
---
Didn't know about TS. I'm going to try. Thanks!
---
Hey. I got the traveling merchant in my bed and he wouldn't move at all. Like I wanted to kill him.. gtfo of my bed!
---
Yeah same dude, I played from beta til like January 2019, and didn‚Äôt comeback til wastlanders
---
I‚Äôll usually post up on the drums or spits with my two xboxes and if I see not many others showed up or the event isn‚Äôt going well, I‚Äôll take one of my guys and start gathering up stuff.
---
I am the same way .. I started the game as a lone wonderer and I had a high level player come by my camp and now he couldn't get rid of me if he tried. Lol I was missing so much. Im level 104 and hadn't launched my first nuke until today! He showed me some great hidden treasures in terms of neat locations with obvious lore connections. He's level 800+.
---
But there are wolves like the OP mentioned. I'm wary on trading outside a vendor ... Just keep your Spidey senses heightened, after all it is the apocalypse so you are bound to be steamrolled at some point. Just remember to call on us other lone Wonders, well get your back and take them out if necessary üòúü§£! Happy safe wondering! And don't forget chally during this meat üçñ week! Hmu anytime if u need another no pressure casual player to jump in with you. On xbox: yehrightdude ... Take care and happy meat week y'all
---
I gave up and did the thing myself. F those robots tho. Resilant bs.
---
The forums are a shitshow. You make a post about PVP and the stans come marching in to flame and bait. They get the post locked but none of them seem to ever get banned.
---
Why they take these opinions as gold is beyond me. They're content with the game being flawed and demand every single step forward be removed. If they only based development off of them, it wouldn't be long until this game has as many features as Fallout 3, with none of the charm.

---
^When I'm at a fight and don't care about being overweight and only care about damage
---
It‚Äôs such a complicated issue. On the one hand, I agree it feels like there is no sense of progression. Should I be able to get stronger and destroy certain areas of the map?
---
On the other hand, this provides a much needed challenge for me after 900 hours. 
---
If you are level 130, I think you may need to rethink your weapons and perk choices though. You should be able to take out those Yao gaui. That said... only 2 of my 3 level 100+ characters probably could do this easily. My other one is completely ill equipped, but that is why it‚Äôs a public event after all.
---
The Leader of the Pack is a great event early on in the Forest, and usually drops 3 one Star weapons if you beat the Alphas to death, and is doable under lvl 5.  Great way to build up XP and level, but also nice stuff to turn in and get early script.  It is also repeatable
---
I run this most days and it never occurred to me to trigger the spawns.  I'd forgotten about that completely.  Nice one üëç
---
Dude I literally just drop whatever people need nowadays. It‚Äôs endgame, if I don‚Äôt use it, it‚Äôs probs being dropped for new players. But THE AMOUNT OF TIMES IVE HAD TO EXPLAIN MUTATIONS AND STARCHED GENES. My god, Bethesda really made a crutch of a perk
---
Shit.. My very 2nd roll was a AA25bashing.... I love my GMini...
---
Haven‚Äôt rolled since...
---
Two shot is a liability in VATS unless you have that armor.
---
I have a explosive beserker auto 5.56 handmade, love that damn weapon to mess around with. Not great for crazy powerful enemies but fun for the forest and such still. I'm a sneak build as well. Can still put a silencer on it as well and shoot from far away. I don't notice any issues with it, still sneaking fine with all available perks enabled for sneak.
---
Well, it's definately not ranged damage.... Not a passive like Plague Walker... Have to be some kind of melee or unarmed...
---
Had a camp there over a year, and i extended the pier. Can confirm, had to redo it 5 times before I realized why the end kept getting stuck under water despite snapping in place. I miss that old place, and now I'm kicking myself for moving right before Meat Week.
---
Then in which case you realise you‚Äôre fucked.
---
It‚Äôs annoying but why is it preventing gameplay? It only opens the season menu when the bar is full, so most of the time your map should open as normal.
---
Gt ChristianNG. Add me if u need help on team or anything.
---
how about a cucu clock for 5 smackers
---
Doesn't seem to be a problem for me.  My long-range rifle "Ol' Painless" is an explosive hunting rifle base, and it doesn't wreck stealth.
---
Im just happy if people join me, any level will do.
---
That's because this is literally the first game that offered it. If players only have bad experiences with PVP due to it being broken, then they form that opinion and the cycle of abuse continues.
---
This game could become so much more. As much as I love it, I would never recommend it to a friend right now.
---
I, a level 36, got downed yesterday after a Primal Cuts event and a level 437 guy just waited me to die and stole my loot. No shame at all.
---
*Once my wife finds out, definitely.*
---
The next hours event did start as normal just this one event for us so far that didnt start as it should on the hour.
---
Only acceptable route here is neither confirm nor deny anything.
---
Just don‚Äôt let North Korea or Iraq near the nuke silos
---
It‚Äôs rng. I crafted the gauss mini four times when I learned the plan. Best one I got was anti armor and a two shot 3 stars. Gauss shotgun I got a 2 star bloodied first roll. Secret service armor I got both arms and chest to be 3 star unyielding after two rolls each. Both legs then took me 80 rolls each to get 3 star unyielding. After the legs taking that Long I said screw it im not buying anymore modules. Gauss pistol I‚Äôve gotten a junkies 3 star and plasma caster I got a 3 star assassins. But since then I got a 3 star bloodied caster from Beckett for alley mission and I got a vampires 3 star gauss mini from purveyor. It‚Äôs a weird thing, just gotta keep trying if you have the patience
---
Talking about this one?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Baaaad_News_Billy_outfit
---
Question... So, I've not actually done meat week events ever, but I once stumbled into a camp set up near a Primal Cuts Location.
---
Is there an overview for Primal Cuts and Grahm's event I could read up on so I can be more helpful?
---
Thanks for your opinion. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs relevant to me.
---
Yes, but No. they "stack" but you are not gonna get 95% Anti armor, it would be more like 70%  or less due to diminishing returns
---
Yes thats it. Thank you so much
---
Gauss + instigating, besides bosses/heavy enemies (behemoths etc) I one shot everything
---
The groups I'm in I usually just message the others to say when they're ready.
---
Or other people have things to do. If they dont join within 5-10 min then switch not everyone can join in 1-2 min.
---
Thanks! I was just wondering if one outclassed another but now ik I might get an AA :)
---
Bloody mess isn't that great now since damage multipliers are additive. Honestly I'd take good with salt over it... huge QOL improvement
---
Atom shop item. No wonder I can't get one on market lol
---
They tried that, and then they added inventive to play on PVP server over the regular one. Pve players would join PVP server, get stomped and spam the forums about survival being the worst game experience they had. Why? Because they had no intention of playing PVP, they just wanted more xp.
---
I've got some tips in the comments and I'm now running around with a vampire exploding automatic handmade and about half of the commando perks (need to level up to get some more). Gotta say, it works. I just shredded a lvl 100 behemoth in about 2 or 3 mags, which sounds like a lot but with that fire rate he was gone before he could even attack me.
---
So yeah, I'm glad I posted this because I've got some good tips. Still need to fine tune a little bit but I'm feeling better about the game again.
---
This isn‚Äôt really related to original topic but when exactly does the meat cook go. I‚Äôve done a few of the events but I know it‚Äôs not every hour like fasnacht just wondering the actual reset time
---
Might show up with halloween coming up if you are lucky.
---
Although not in the scoreboard there is an atom shop bundle incoming with the Armor Ace Tanker uniform which has Platinum's suit with Brickhouse's helmet. There is also the incoming "Red Viper" Communist Commander outfit which looks like a USSR variant of the chinese jumpsuit of Fallout 3, but with the khaki coloration and Russian star on the Ushanka. Not going to lie, would love to see a buildable Tank and APC for our camps.
---
and hey, if AA isnt your cup of tea. you would become a vampire's heavy gunner. its nice to be able to save stims for reviving people.. and to pawn off for caps
---
Since OW, I am fully perked for stealth rifleman and I also keep all 3 maxed cards equipped for heavy gunner.  Then I swap them out for weight perks when I get overencumbered, and sneak home to unload.
---
The only problem with meat week is that ..first world problems!
---
I‚Äôm maxed out on caps
---
I‚Äôm maxed out on stash
---
I‚Äôve got enough treasury notes for 3 weeks 
---
My other characters are close to maxing out 
---
I used 30 1 star weapons to get my scrip today to free up some weight and within a few hours I‚Äôm full again.
---
I‚Äôm spending all the time between events freeing up space.. but damn it‚Äôs fun :)
---
I will prey to the great lord up above lol Todd
---
While your in there, do we really need the 8000 flies on the meat piles when the engine can't efficiently handle that many particles?
---
TSE is worthless on shotguns
---
We do need more flag options
---
Any current already released games aren't going to be taken away from anything
---
Quick
---
It's accurate as of patch 22, not that any of these have been touched since launch
---
Then wonder why your camp gets nuked :)
---
Find a vampire commando weapon and you will be ok. 
---
Replace the Sneak perks with defensive perks or damage, and you'll have fun.
---
VapeStain69. Have a Discord server with a small guild if you're interested.
---
It would be even greater if you could get a session log that logs events, quests, rewards, vendor sales, level ups and evry thing else you complete. I can imagine this takes alot of effort and server capacity but it would be practicall
---
No, but bare in mind you won't get the high tier rewards until you're 50+.
---
Good for XP though, just keep up with the uplink areas so you're helping, and if you get downed, respawn, don't ask to be stimpak'd you'll respawn quickly near the uplink :)
---
Sorry. :D
---
Thank God lol. I was going to say if it is there's not really a point in playing but that's my mind set (I would still play but wouldn't be happy with myself lmao) Thanks for the quick response, I take that ESO is sticking around too then? This is kinda why I think they going to do TES and Fo on PS5 too but I'm not too sure. I really hope they do. Been waiting for TES VI for nearly 10 years lol
---
Step one take out of stash. 
---
Step two put in scrip machine.
---
Step three go to purvayer.

Step 4 use literally anything else.
---
No but seriously certain guns needs some love and more mods.
---
Well it depends. Some people have already left you the answers to the decrypted launch codes. If you want to do it the legit way you should able to figure out the words by Sunday. I‚Äôm surprised you only see 1 letter though. May need to hop servers.
---
All fallout 4 content should he free. Huge scam
---
Strength boosts carry capacity and melee damage
---
Perception allows your radar compass to highlight enemies farther away and increases VATS accuracy. 
---
Endurance Boosts max HP and disease resistance
---
Charisma changes NPC vendor prices in your favor and allows you to share more potent perk cards with your team
---
Intelligence has been confirmed to impact XP Gain, Better durability on crafted stuff, and better scrap yield from scrapping stuff
---
Agility increases Sneak effectiveness, and Max AP 
---
Luck allows your Vats crit meter to fill faster, and makes found items have better durability
---
These are what make you S.P..EC.I.A.L
---
Personally speaking though, i would like it if they buffed the damage cards from 10%/15%/20% to 10%/20%/30%
---
Gt ChristianNG. If i can help in anything, let me know.
---
Commando is a game changer. I just really don‚Äôt want to do it one of my characters.
---
Piercing gaze is the weakest mutation
---
I would love to get a VE gat laser but that's a far fetch xd
---
Eso is sticking around too. 
---
No 110% on TES VI yet, but since it has been "hey guys, we're making this" I think it'll still be on ps5? But no real guarantee. 
---
Same with whatever the next Fallout game is. Starfield will likely be on Ps5 too
---
Power armor enemies are made of paper. So damn underwhelming. They never have a full suit, so they never get damage reduction.
---
There are thousands of PVP games out there. This is a different audience. Sometimes you gotta stop trying to force what you want on everyone else. Sometimes your baby just doesn‚Äôt want to eat their peas, and you have to leave your wife and kids and find a new baby who eats their vegetables. Hmm... that metaphor got away from me.
---
yeah I don't use 12 plus guns on my heavy but I do use 4 each for different things
---
With all the new stuff it‚Äôs easy to max out caps,  at that point I buy weapons or Ammo.
---
If I find ammo at a good price I‚Äôll buy it up.
---
Go commando and build your fixer properly to use as less AP as possible.
---
" **This weapon, with proper configuration (reflex optics, swift/quick magazine, aligned long barrel, forceful stock/grip and automatic receiver) is capable of getting its VATS AP cost almost to zero.** "
---
Again, game play mechanic
---
It's all about the love of the game. Male or female, doesn't matter. As long as you enjoy the game that's all the matters
---
Gooble gabble gooble gabble

I'm watching you on here now......
---
Following Todd around will get you a different reward.
---
Only if you don't stay near the objective to contribute to the x4 (this includes dying and re-spawning and the time it takes to run back)
---
Maybe your toon has a nice arse?
---
Rust was, and is, extremely popular for the same open world survival pvp. Shame a decent looking game with a great world can't be allowed to succeed it.
---
I run with absolutely no-one I think one guy added me because I gave him stuff. Other than that I've solo'd to 56 and finally did my first Dailys today. Only two of us though. Lol
---
This is your fault for relying on strangers for your daily op.  Sometimes i need inspirational and the only teams available on the server are ops teams.  Just because i am on that team does not mean I am obligated in any way shape or form to spend my own time helping you with yours.
---
If you don't like the way strangers are participating in the team you joined then make your own team and kick people you dont want on it or simply ask a friend to help you.
---
No one is entitled to someone else's free time just because they joined a public team.
---
&gt; most of the playerbase is PS
---
According to whom?
---
I'll team up with you. Im 196 and a big tpb fan too
---
People are saying they didn't pay 7.5b to get the same numbers, but if they LITTERLT HALF the playerbase they arnt going to make the same, there going to make less. I don't think Doom and Wolfinsein maybe won't be on becasue I don't think Sony would be to bothed  since their playbase isn't as big as TES or Fallout but still, i'l take what I can get lol
---
In your guide it says, that you need 7880 xp for levels between level 50 to 100, and 15880 for the levels after that.
---
I believe that not to be correct.
---
The datamined xp curve seems to be correct, but the interpretation seems so be off. In the linked discussion it is interpreted as linear function from 1 to 50, and flat curve with a constant xp value after that, with a jump in the value at 100 and another jump at 1000.
---
Instead it seems more like a linear funktion with the same slope until it flattens to a constant value at level 1000.
---
Ash piles have been weird and a nuisance since Fallout 3. Remember how they seemed to never go away and you could tell if you were returning to an area by the glowing green piles? 
---
I'm not a big EW user, so I'd be happy to just have them replaced by meat piles.
---
You hit the nail on the head, take my award :)
---
Considering over half of the Fallout 76 players is PS? That's more that half, so most
---
Because we are collectors?
---
This is what i did! A kind player gave me 6 cobalt and i bought the violet one for 100 ea at a camp vendor, i can now hop around in a jetpack at lvl 30! I love it!
---
Exactly. Some people kick you from their team if you dont join the mission within 30 seconds. Not to mention that, at least on PS4, loading can be slow as hell and if you get kicked from the team you're automatically out of the session and cant play the event.
---
Well, one other thing we 100% know. Is Microsoft will be getting exclusives on a "case by case basis". So maybe future versions of games etc. We don't know which ones though, but regardless they make more money, either people buy xboxes to play games. Or they buy them on ps5 but Microsoft still gets money from it.
---
And some will obviously only be on xbox/pc
---
According to the testing i did they are not.
---
Embrace it!
---
Hate those guys.
---
You can get it once you have access to that part of the bunker where they explain the launch systems.

Full disclosure: I may be level 178, but that by no means indicates my complete knowledge of this game. I‚Äôm super casual and haven‚Äôt really had the patience to really streamline my build, so I don‚Äôt really have the ability to just melt enemies like I see others doing at my level.
---
The heck did he pick that up for? Radaway is kinda useless for higher levels. Unless it's to keep their douchebag meter filled.
---
Had this happen twice this week, maybe a dozen or so times total since launch. üò¢
---
Its meat week need to have burgers instead üòÖü§£üòÇ
---
I always have and always do.  No one is shopping.
---
I'm expecting the lesser played games, like Wolfenstein and Doom as I said before, but I'm I think it would cost them more to port them over consoles. Plus I don't think Sony would want to buy them if they don't think they will make the money back. I just hope they don't do anything too rash.
---
Totally agree! I made this some time back.

---
I think they've cocked up the drop rates, I now have a straight run of 6 Elders with no rare rewards. I dont intend on doing it  anymore. I just trade for the plans I want, it far less frustrating :-)
---
Where's the treehouse village?
---
It is on the hour every hour.
---
Your sexy and you know it.
---
The gatling gun doesn't wake up sleeping ghouls so I dunno if its quiet or glitched walking up to them in my power armour wakes them up though
---
Rash? Wouldn't be rash imo, they can do whatever they please to make more money. 
---
If it upsets some Sony players?  
---
Imo that's on sony, they are very... uh... against sharing much of anything. Why should xbox now that they own Zenimax and every company owned by them?
---
&gt; Considering over half of the Fallout 76 players is PS? 
---
Again, according to whom?
---
What level are you? When I was a low level I had high level players watch over me and helped out if I got in trouble.
---
Drop rates are low and you only get 1 chance per day at a toll for each level. So you actually only roll for the 80% chance at elder once per day. Any ops runs after you hit elder will never give rare rewards.
---
Tbh Sony have made all their games from the ground up, Mincrosoft just a AAA game company and don't expect people to start asking for games which have been assumed to release on both consoles for over 10yrs but that's imo.
---
Have you been playing since the beta? I had a character id been playing since beta, I literally could NOT get anything above a 1 star legendary (unless I bought it) my damag output was absolute ass and a lot of "Common" items were next to impossible to farm. Since I've made a new character I have had countless 2/3 star legendary drops, I can actually farm stuff and my damage is actually decent. So if you had a character since beta, you might need to make a new...
---
&gt; I use explosive bullets
---
No you don't. There are no explosive bullets in this game.
---
And? Sony is praised for exclusives, I'm pretty sure Microsoft can too considering they did indeed pay 7.5b.
---
Nm. Since it came to GamePass
---
I expect expeditions to be robots you send out on missions and they come back with materials or items.  Based out of the BOS base.  Not really useful but a thing many games do including fallout shelter and even wow.
---
Ye but Imo they would lose half if the money if they cut off half the playerbase
---
That might be the answer to "when", still not an answer to what I was asking.
---
Search tab at the top. This has been asked and answered many times.
---
Are you tracking the daily 10k XP by chance?
---
Not really, no. If anything would would earn more. It would make people inclined to buy an Xbox or a PC, which would would make them money, so... sounds like a win with either choice.
---
Just nuke his camp. He wants to throw stones then throw a bolder. Simple math equation really.
---
Make pvp like the division does, give us a 2nd stat for our gear, that is normalized regardless of what level it is.  
---
Everything during pvp needs to be normalized across the board, so that you will never have an edge over someone else regardless of what build you have.
---
The 110 dmg cap was just a band aid fix.  
---
pvp needs to be fun, not one sided.
---
Yeah
---
No tracking of any kind. This only started when I bought two tanks to get the ship in a bottle early.
---
Oh, I guess I was just wrong. Thanks tho, very useful
---
Idk. I don't really know anybody whod switch just for 1game company, plus I think they would have said before everybody preorderd their now console but idk. Unless they coundt say anything but still they could have said within a day or 2 of buying Bethsda saying all upcoming Fallout and TES games will be exclusive to Xbox and PC only but they didn't so I don't quite know what to say. It's just a matter of waiting but I'm impatient so idk lol.
---
Gt: ChristianNG
---
Do you have unclaimed SCORE prizes?
---
Meh, regardless what Microsoft decides to do they make money. 
---
They really win regardless of what becomes and exclusive and what doesn't.
---
Joining a special Ops team and not doing the op's is kind of a douchebag move. Whether you believe it or not, it is.
---
Best part of the game! Look up PKOA üòÅ
---
Sony always buys timed exclusives, and have bought rights to franchise's and then releasing them to their platform (Spiderman)
---
Idk. I just hope they do. Imo it would make less money but we'd have to see. I
---
Ye they started the franchise's pretty much.
---
If I'm giving a good bit away and there's people around I'll either do the trade for free or bring them to my camp. I'm only a lvl 40 so can't offer a lot but when I started I'd of loved for someone to drop me food and water.
---
My BE laser holds as much ammo as I have, so clip size is currently about 5000 :-)
---
They may buy them for timed exclusives but I would be too bothered because I'd understand since they do make the games they should get them first. Just I'm wounding be too bothed if they released it 6 months later. But we'd just have to wait and see.
---
Lots of good high level players on Xbox who are more than willing to help. Chipper7773 if u see me in the wastes and need anything gimme a shout
---
Gotta love beneficial glitches
---
I did 8 runs today ( 4 characters ) - did 4 solo and got Paladin every time time and got nothing. Then joined teams  and did 4 times again and got Elder every time and got one rare reward on the last go ( Sympto-matic plan ) .
---
If I didn't get that I would have been pissed. I think getting nothing on Elder is quite common.
---
Yesterday I, a level 212, saw a level 29 defending Grafton steel and decided I'd go and help for my event score. After helping I dropped 30 stimpaks, showed them, and walked away. I always check my inventory when I'm going to be near low levels and give things when I can. 
---
Pro tip - if you are low on stimpaks but have a good supply of Nuka Cola, Nuka Cherry, or any other, they will work to get your health back up at a cost to rads now and thirst later. Save a couple Nuka Cola Qauntum for a full refill of your health. Nuka Cranberry will also give you an XP boost.
---
Just replied to ur pm sorry just saw it
---
This could more be done for everything with a slider, for putting item into a vendor it would be good if you could just type the amount. (sell price or amount of items etc.)
---
Not a problem i play in the nights on the weekends cause I work night shift during the week
---
Exactly. Go play rust. This is a different game.
---
No it isn't.  You do not need 4 people to get an under 8 minute run time.  2 is more than enough.  And I have been on Ops teams where I had no intention of doing the op but one person went in and no one else from the team joined them so I did go to help even though I had already did mine but sometimes I am busy and cannot.
---
If possible, I will always try to put myself on a casual team when entering a server if I do not plan on doing the daily op but sometimes an Ops team is the only team available and I need inspirational right away.  If a casual team gets formed on the server I will join that one and the leader of the Ops team has every right to kick me if they do not like me being on the team and not doing the op. 
---
No one is entitled to my free time under any circumstances, I help when I can.  This is not "kind of a douchebag move".  It's life.
---
I‚Äôm also waiting for a beer arm and tenderizer to drop lol
---
This actually isn't the case anymore now that the damage is additive instead of multiplicative. Penta beats tri in dps now.
---
That's clever. Good likeness.
---
Lincoln üôà
---
It's so absurd to me that you can only put in a maximum of 20 at a time but the slider for how many you want to put in goes past 20.  The people who create these systems and interfaces do not play their games at the same level that we do and it shows.
---
Yes there is looking at my guns right now. The Fixer - 3 star legendary. Bullets explode for area damage. Etc. Lever Action. 3 star legendary Bullets explode for area damage. Etc. Just because I am a female gamer doesn't mean I don't know how to read. Thanks for your mansplaining.
---
I was referring to games Sony don't own they have been purchasing timed exclusive contracts for a while now, even 2 Bethesda games coming out soon are timed with Sony, but when they do it it's fine ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I just like running around solo, i do participate with certain events. But thats about it. The only interaction i have  with other players is trading.
---
Primal cuts happens somewhere on the map every 15 minutes. There are locations in each region. Not all will activate each time but there will be a notification at the top of your screen when one goes live. Then you look you the event icon on your map and fast travel to the event. At the event there is a barrel drum to beat on to attract the prime beasts. You will fight 4 waves of creatures and then a boss in a set amount of time. 6 or 8 minutes I think. You will be rewarded with prime meat. Each region‚Äôs event gives different amounts of prime meat. The harder the region the more meat. You need at least 5 piece of prime meat for it to be useful at the Meat Cook. 
---
Every hour Meat Cook happens just south of vault 76. There are 3 barrel drums and 3 meat spits to turn. Playing drums and turning spits help fill the progress bar. There is a two minute period at the start of the meat cook that if 3 people play drums and 3 people turn spits will fill the progress bar 2/3 full before the active part of the event really starts. When the active part starts put any prime meat you have on the grill to get ‚ÄúThe Meat Sweats‚Äù your hunger bar will not go down for 30 minutes. Kill critters (small animals) and collect critter chunks to deposit in the shopping cart. Collect greens and deposit in the cooler for the humans that don‚Äôt eat meat because Graham wants all his friends to get to eat. Clean up debris from previous meat cooks, clean up Chally‚Äôs ‚Äústinky piles‚Äù and put out grass fires until the progress bar is full. Enjoy your well earned rewards.
---
I am experiencing exactly the same issue.
---
I've been using my commando weapon long before the patch, and I was using VATS all the time - it never consumed so many cores before, I am absolutely adamant about that, because I'm a heavy hoarder and was constantly stacking on my Power Cores.
---
After the patch went live, all of my 30 power cores are now gone. I had 'Power User' perk on at all times, and it was already draining too fast, but yesterday specifically has proved to me, that something is definitely wrong: I started my game with **11 power cores**, I took 'Power user' off and joined 2x Monongah Mine events one after another.. when I was done with 2nd event and went to camp, I had **3 Power Cores** left. 
---
Something has indeed changed, probably with VATS, but nobody is talking about it, and you will be constantly downvoted, because "nobody else is having this issue, which means nothing is wrong".
---
In that sense problem is related to majority of the builds being either PA+Heavy, which means they hardly ever use VATS, or blyadid, which doesn't require PA at all.
---
Either way, we won't get this seen/fixed for a long time.
---
Why not - count me in as well. 
---
Xbox Gamertag: Paladin Bailey.
---
I'm leader of a small (yet slowly growing) Brotherhood of Steel group (An RP focused group that's primarily focused on helping people rather than instigating fights)
---
Hope to see you in the Wasteland fellow Vaulties.
---
Right, that's what I'm saying man. It's just annoying as hell lol. Hell, make it 50-100 for a week. Let the grinders unload some.
---
Sniperbuild is fine, just not very competative. Using stealth isnt viable in endgame activities like daily ops or nuke events, thankfully you can pretty much swap between rifleman and commando easily once you get enough perks. Heavygunner however is the easiest build to make viable, jump into a PA and equip a high level 50 cal and youre good to go with the correct perks.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. It‚Äôs really easy to miss the notice sometimes. I‚Äôve definitely missed it a couple of times because I was crafting or doing daily ops or something.
---
Ye, that's why I said I'd understand if they were timed exclusives but not console exclusives.
---
This is the way
---
Awwww sweet. This is gonna be good
---
The terminal is located to the right of the MODUS vendor in the military wing.  It's a big red computer.
---
Hehehehe nice. And it is going to be a gent. I gave many more ideas to share
---
Why not just make your own casual team? People always join and you get your inspirational. The point of a Daily Ops team is to do the Daily Op.
---
The thing is, that is part of the game, grabbing dropped loot. However, we run into so many great people that actually share and help without wanting anything in return. I kinda forget there are some that are not like this.
---
So to all of the players that help out, pickup and watch out for all others especially the noobs, I salute you.
---
THANK YOU

This! I carry two legendary flamers and at least one weight reduced plasma flamer on each of my higher level characters, sometimes you gotta melt things to beat the last few seconds on the clock. üòÖ
---
Yes and no. It depends on how you use it.
---
Example. Ive got what rads legendary perk and ghoulish. If i go into a nuke zone in PA my HP is always full and ive never got rads.
---
Block for session and fast travel away?
---
Once youve done a silo, you get a card to take the lift back to launch prep. skips everything but prep on your next run
---
If they're going to make an artificial grind, at least make it a LITTLE easier...
---
I wish people would fight against exclusive in general it's anti consumer but people only seem to care when its Microsoft.
---
Because most of the time when I join a server I have xp buffs running and I do not have time to sit and wait on a team by myself and hope someone joins so I can get inspirational.  I need to get killing right away to not waste time.
---
If you don't like that I am on your daily ops team and not doing the op feel free to kick me.  No hard feelings it's within your right as a group leader.
---
I keep seeing people with this issue but I‚Äôve used a gauss shotty for months and never had a problem. It‚Äôs rare I don‚Äôt hit, no matter what distance. I have a +33% vats though, maybe that makes the difference?
---
I don't care if it's timed exclusives but not completely exclusives.
---
First, are you using vats? It only works with shotguns in vats. Second, quad is the prefix I get it, but 33% vats chance and ffr (faster firerate) are both major effects, didn‚Äôt you mean faster reload? If so yes, 33% major makes it vats, I have a vamp 33 gauss shotgun and it works, but only in vats, and even then it‚Äôs a little finicky sometimes
---
This community is awesome!
---
Gives me an idea for halloween now... i got a bajillion candy I've been saving for no reason from the monster mash events LOL
---
See i never had this experience, i've run into the flatwoods monster twice, and a mothman in the wild once, both times i eagerly engaged and they bolted :/
---
I run stealth commando and pa heavy on the same toon. Before legendary perks some sacrifices had to be made on damage perks (2-2-2) but i got them both (commando/heavy gunner) to 3-3-3 now. Basically end up swapping dodgy/sneak and serendipity/bloody mess to go between the two.
---
Puh-lease.
---
I'm forever near maxed cap limit, I have over 1000 treasury notes and enough 3\* 1-2lb legendaries to keep me occupied for a month. Bethesda needs to sort out the currency limits before they do ANYTHING else. I cannot be the only one with this problem.
---
While I agree events like these keep me interested, I feel incredibly discouraged to even do them when I am always at or near my limits.
---
I‚Äôve done the event with 10 or more collecting and one on the drums and no one on the spits and the event failed because the bar drops faster than people think and you can‚Äôt keep up. The drums and spits slow down the drop enough to get enough collecting done.
---
/yourjokebutworse
---
50?!
---
What are you guys running into nuke zones with regular armor or something?
---
Yet they don't use explosive ammo, but either lead ones or ultracite.
---
Ok thanks, seems the expensive stuff is just time sink for nothing.
---
Yeah we should get one here soon to show when time is running up. I think. Idk tho
---
Smhhhh
---
Exactly, plus the Armor Ace uses one as well
---
Hmmm, maybe Armor Ace isnt as American as we thinkü§î
---
Omg yes that would be dope as well
---
There‚Äôs a vendor bot in Grafton not in The train station and one in Watoga
---
I havent rly had much issues killing them. What weapon do u use?  I use junkies FFR heavy weapons mainly. The junkies FFR ultracite gatling laser with prime mod is rly badass tbf
---
Once you get what you need, buy everything
---
Just buy random stuff like backpack mods and othe random stuff you won't ever use.
---
best source of acid now is prime yaoguai and prime snallygasters, just run the meat week event and youll get like 100+ acid
---
Magic gun... Can't compare that to a normal one.
---
Well it would work the same with the radios. Whenever you join a world your radios are turned off. It would work pretty much as a radio but on a tv screen
---
there is an outfit version of the brotherhood fatigues :/
---
Why? As long as I don't pvp with those guns I can't see the problem.. how does my farming xp with a legacy affect you? Or you just don't have one?
---
Send me a msg when im online and i help u.
---
Well he's using the "what rads" card so that could be the case honestly.
---
yeah it still rains inside the greenhouse dome, and the bunker iirc
---
Even though I know the codes I plan to do it with the pieces at least once, but I am doing to have to find people to do it with because my poorly optimized rifle vats build can't go through that many asaultrons until I level enough to move my points around.
---
Let's us not forget the one near top of the world with the raider stuff
---
Great explanation.
---
I‚Äôve noticed VATS being shit on my shotguns and I don‚Äôt even have the Gauss shotgun. Even with 90% plus chance to hit and a decent Luck score I can miss all eight shots with my combat shotgun.
---
Or let me present a different scenario to you. My friends and I run a four person team almost every night. We like bonuses, so we make public teams. We usually run casual for the extra intelligence boost, then the team lead will switch to events if we are doing something worth the extra XP like Heart of the Swamp. We switch it for the Daily OPS team when we decide to do that. 
---
*Sometimes we forget to switch it back because that‚Äôs life.*
---
So then one person has things to do, logs out, and then someone like you joins and gets mad at us because we don‚Äôt immediately join you in Daily Ops. Dude first, we didn‚Äôt even notice you joined. Second, we didn‚Äôt even realize we were still set to Daily Ops. Third, I think it‚Äôs kind of presumptive to assume we were all just waiting on a fourth so we could go do the event ‚Äúoh thank god ChadSmasher69 showed up, now we will get Elder for sure‚Äù seriously? We can hit Elder repeatedly on a two or three person team. If you‚Äôre joining a group of level 200+ players in a Daily Ops team and *they aren‚Äôt currently in a Daily Ops* I doubt it was because they‚Äôre waiting on a rando fourth. 
---
Should we remember to always switch back to casual? Yeah probably. But we don‚Äôt, and this is just a game, and if all of this is an issue, start your own Daily Ops team and let three random players join you.
---
He's stuck in his own fantasy where nothing he does is wrong or affects others.

---
And the logs for the pile of wood !!
---
Wow.   Some of you guys are so gifted.
---
I have a selection since Wastlanders and getting the plan, including the +33% vats and that bashing one, they all do the same thing, miss so many times.
---
I do try to do the double tap, VATS on - off - on and that helps but what a performance, OK for stealth sniping but then I don't use VATS then anyway.
---
And the leftover rotten meat piles with flies count like fire and chally piles
---
please heck i hope they‚Äôre smart and add this. would be awesome. could have a quicker fire rate than the lever and whatnot, hit harder than semi auto fixer / handmade, and be suppressed. would really help solve their rifleman problem. dang. i want this!
---
No! I won‚Äôt remember him!! He ripped me off!!
---
Regardless of the mental gymnastics you do to convince yourself otherwise, you‚Äôre flat out wrong. If the teams weren‚Äôt categorized, you would be correct. We have all met people like you, so I know there is nothing anyone can say to change your opinion.     
---
I wonder if there is some language barrier causing you to not understand why this is selfish behavior. You seem to not know the difference between ‚Äúneed‚Äù and ‚Äúwant.‚Äù I could be wrong. Maybe you do ‚Äúneed‚Äù the Inspiration card. However, if that‚Äôs true, I suggest you seek professional help. If you truly need it instead of want it, there are some compulsions you have that may affect other parts of your life. Perhaps that compulsion is why you can‚Äôt consider others in your decision-making process and you end up unintentionally being a dick.
---
I have several. I just don‚Äôt use them because I think ‚ÄúEast buttons‚Äù are stupid,

I got 3 tenderizer plans so far ,one mod plan , and like 5 flags , 3 grills , 2 backpacks ,and 3 full outfits of each
---
But but... Muh Legendaries. Muh Scrip! ;)
---
It should be redesigned like eso have. You get a popup when a group is found, and you have one min to get ready and when everyone pressed ready check, everyone gets automaticly portet in.
---
But they cant loot it if they didnt kill it
---
Don't try to justify yourself. Joining a special Ops team and not helping with their special Ops is exactly what I said, a douchebag thing to do.  No one is entitled to your free time but you shouldn't spend your free time ruining other people's free time.  Not only is that a douchebag thing to do but it's very selfish
---
It seems to not effect everyone either so it‚Äôs going to make it a long haul for us üò≠
---
So pick up poop
---
Pretty pretty please Bethesda. 
---
Incoming thread deletion in 3....2...1...
---
Apparently the team can still show up as an ops team if it's changed, so it's best to leave and create a new (casual) team
---
Also grahm sells a plan for challys feed , if you make a ton of it before the cookout , you deposit it in the pile of hay and it adds like 5-10% per feed
---
I'm one of those who say no. I appreciate your kindness, but this tiny lv20 girl is just my alt, my aid supplier is my main at lv280ish.
---
Some noobs are just scared to accept stuff and it's true, but some of them could be alts like mine not wanting to take your useful aid that could be given to someone who needs it &lt;3
---
I had a guy that started giving me so much stuff and actually crafting it that refusing started to make me feel guilty so I actually threw away my armor &amp; underarmor to use his and spammed heart emotes.
---
The only thing I couldn't bring myself to use was the brotherhood sniper rifle. Sorry brother, my lv15 MuE handmade is just bomb.
---
It's already been muted and deleted. You didn't see anything....
---
You get a roll for every rank you unlock. The higher the rank the higher is the chance for the roll for that rank.
---
If you unlock elder in the first try, you get all 3 rolls at once.
---
It's sad, but now I don't even bother looking at the legendarys I kill in west Tek or Whitespring anymore, literally just for XP....
---
The reason this argument is pointless is you keep ignoring the one fundamental thing that undermines everything to do with anything you say - PvP wasn't popular from inception. It wasn't that it WAS popular but then became less so like with NW. That just was never the case with the base game.
---
Say what you will about all the other stuff and I agree all those things further hampered the popularity of PvP. Self evidently so. The thing you keep choosing to ignore was PvP wasn't popular from the moment people could play Beta, play the launched game, play Survival mode. People didn't show in sufficient numbers as it was.
---
So you're whole notion that PvP wasn't popular because of bad mechanics is really a moot point - the game mode was never popular to begin with.
---
It's like arguing that eating feces isn't popular because it wasn't prepared right and it was made to look unappetising and it had bad marketing. That's what your argument amounts to. Except, just like eating feces, it was never popular to begin with.
---
Arguing how less popular it became after the fact is pointless when the starting point is that PvP was not popular. It's irrelevant how further unpopular it became when it starting off not being popular all.
---
Happy to be proven wrong that PvP was popular at inception if you have the evidence for it but I know you can't because I was there each of those milestones and saw for myself how unpopular it was.
---
Why would you think you're the only one with this problem
---
Dont forget to make chally feed too !
---
Please include a Santa themed sentry bot, Jolly Ol' Sentry Nicholas, that we can build in camps that other players can get random gifts from once an hour.  
---
Ultra rare gift drop from it, 3 star legendary assaultron head with a red nose lightbulb welded on.
---
I agree you 100%. My personal pet peeve is Script. Script limits should go. Most rolls are trash RNG so having a low limit of 150 is really silly. When I see players throwing away legendaries, you know something's off.
---
From a game designer perspective, I get time gating gold bullion. The rewards are the newest things out there and in some cases, the best. If they didn't limit gold, then you'd have people with all the plans inside of a week and then they'd complain there's nothing to do.
---
If you're well off on weight server hop looking for high ticket light weight items such as bobbleheads, magazines, and clothing to sit on. If you're 1st member buyout junk. Then funnel your scrip and gold back into caps, rinse and repeat.
---
I do and I highly doubt the FO76 devs have ever seen the drawings you posted.
---
Itll move if they drop something else
---
My buddy and I lost it when he walked out
---
We need a ready button. I've been using the yes emote to signify when I'm ready but it doesn't appear to be catching on.
---
If someone has ultra high priced low level stuff or is being an overall jerk, I've been handing out nukes to camps. They either leave or take the hit. Either way, justice served.
---
Oh... My... God... I am twitching just thinking about that. To be fair I do just drop/leave 1\* and any heavy legendary. Unless I know my script limit has been reset so I can quickly flip them.
---
I‚Äôm maxed out on gold and unsure what to do with the gold I‚Äôve to claim from the season 2 run

---
Talking about this.
---
If by 'uncommon' you mean 'a lower droprate than The Fixer Plan'.
---
Thankfully this convo is at the top so I could easily see that this post is garbage. Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Are you sure it's 100%?
---
Buy Lunchboxes. I thought I saw they are available for purchase with gold.
---
Not only can you continue to benefit from these (where you won't from plans you don't use) but others can get a boost too and will thank you for it.
---
That's a long way of saying "I should switch it back to casual after we're done so we don't mislead other people in the server."
---
Transportation director Bryukhanov reports no more than 3.6 roentgen.
---
Because most people complain about having one of those issues, not all of them lol.
---
But I really am near breaking point with this.
---
That stuff is outdated. I‚Äôm an avid PvPer, so you can take my word on it.
---
I wish they would add the Fallout 3 assault rifle but instead in 4 they added the ugly one we have now but still use the fo3 one for all the perk cards
---
Just use escape artist, no need to waste two leg slots.
---
Theres always those 2 family members who fight at thanksgiving .
---
Nuke em
---
You're completely right with that. It's compounded more so during special events like Meat Week, legendaries just covering the floors every hour. It's madness. But yeah, I'll get 1000 scrip, buy a whole bunch and then it'll take me over half a week to get rid of (let's face it) all the legendaries I got....
---
I think you ment "for the love of mothman " ;)
---
hrhr, I was just hoping to get some real numbers, not the bullcrap marketing puts out.
---
How is it selfish behavior?  I have stated that I have helped people before when no one else on the team joined the daily op even if I had already did it if I was not busy and able to help.  I consider others and what I am doing at the time.  If I can help I do if I am busy I do not.  I am also always actively looking to place myself on a different team as soon as the opportunity arises.
---
Let's talk about "need" and "want" if you want to go down the route of semantics.  No one "needs" everyone on the team to drop everything they are doing and go into the op as soon as they start it.  But they want it.  No one needs to do the daily op.  But when some people join an op and other people are busy or maybe afk or any other of valid reasons why they cannot participate as well, some people get irrationally angry and offended that things did not turn out how they wanted.  Just like I don't "need" inspirational but I "want" it.
---
I have had it happen to me before where I need to do my op for the day and I join an full op team, join the op, wait a few minutes and no one else joins the op.  
---
I don't get mad at the other players.  I don't get upset.  I realize that they may be busy with other things or afk dealing with other real life things and I message a friend or join another team or server and everything is ok.
---
I was considering this but I am not a big player anymore that's why I don't have fallout 1st. I only play to do my dailies these days. Not on long enough to sell the stuff I have in my vendors lol. But I would play more if I COULD. I just can't with all these limits in place. I am quite literally stuck.
---
Clickbait title. Thought this post was about the legendary effect :)
---
Max caps, max bullion, max scrip, full mules, masses in my scrapbox and have the best weapons for my character, just becomes dead weight...
---
Those trade menu screens have been the cause of every single dupe that has happened in Fallout 76 thus far. 
---
I'd think they'd be terrified of modifying these screens lol.
---
Ok cool, don't use them, but let people enjoy theirs. It doesn't affect you, asking to remove those from the game affects others, and it's stupid imo.
---
If we talk about PvP I agree, I don't even bring legacies to public events if crowded cause they make everything lag and give no chance to others to tag enemies. I actually nuked an idiot's camp an hour ago cause he was spamming his explo gat plasma during rad rumble and he left the server (lvl 400+ if you are reading this, you suck)
---
Why you don't scrip your legacies btw? I mean, you don't like them so...
---
the only thing i can think of for joining a daily Op team and not doing it right away is that the multiplier bonus for XP takes a few minutes to kick in. maybe they‚Äôre waiting until bond maxes out before they join? regardless, if you see a teammate start the Op you should join. 
---
maybe Op teams should be a bit different, like when you complete the Op your bonds go to 100% automatically. and then perhaps prompt the team leader when it‚Äôs over if they want to disband or convert the group, if you‚Äôre not running the Op again.
---
6.25% drop rate from Encryptid. For the sake of comparison, The Fixer Plan has a 10% drop rate from Encryptid. 
---
My wife sells them in her vendors for 4k per piece and never has enough spare to worry about how long they take to sell.
---
They look good on my wall.
---
And they represent a broken game mechanic.
---
Either fix them or get rid of them.
---
Just my opinion.
---
I try to flash the thumbs up and then question marks but I rarely provoke a response.
---
No no no. Lincoin is fine. Hes on the penny let this guy have a win.
---
The gold one is one of the easier ones for me as I have over 1000 treasury notes I get rid of 20 a day until I hit the 5000, I then methodically go to each vendor and buy out each plan. I'm not finished yet but will be soon... Then what? I have more gold than I can physically get rid of...
---
In my opinion the selfish person is the one who gets upset when others do not drop whatever they are doing at a moments notice to assist them.   I have helped others plenty of times and will continue to do so when I am able to.
---
I have had it happen to me before where I need to do my op for the day and I join an full op team, join the op, wait a few minutes and no one else joins the op.
---
I don't get mad at the other players. I don't get upset. I realize that they may be busy with other things or afk dealing with other real life things and I message a friend or join another team or server and everything is ok.
---
Super Duper won't double what is shown an screen with the ammo perks. You get the unmodified base amount.
---
Unless you mean you've already finished with that and are in the same boat as me lol
---
Meat week is the most fun I've had playing this game just about ever. 
---
The only flaw about meat week for me that ruins the experience is you start to notice all the caps and limits pretty damn fast and that is honestly such a shame.
---
they are, 100 gold each. 3 at a time from both crater and foundation
---
Seriously.   Does anyone even lock their water purifiers?
---
I want an M1A/M14 like what they show in the FO4 live trailer
---
Since all legendary rolls are random, and there's a very low chance of getting what you want... I dont think there's any harm in removing script limits now that bullion is in place.
---
I hate how crafting legendary armor can still give you a 1 or 2 star instead of a guaranteed 3 star.
---
Some guy gave me 100 stims and a shhit ton of good gear I now run a junkies gauss stealth build and is op as hell so done tell me giving stuff to low levels is making them weak
---
I've learned to just join the Daily Op if no one else is starting it. Usually they'll join, and if they don't, I just server hop or LFG
---
New? How could you do my boy Wallace dirty like that? /s
---
I don't think you do. Inspired means that something was influenced by something else. It does not mean copy every single detail. Don't get you panties in a bunch, but you are being too literal. The devs already nearly copied am old Soviet air port fire truck for the fire trucks  in the game, as seem here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWl-0FfUm0Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWl-0FfUm0Q)
---
I‚Äôve only got the plans I wanted which is the secret service armour, gauss mini gun with mods, gauss shotgun with mods, ammo machine and the farming tiles. Unsure if there‚Äôs Anything else work getting? Lol and I‚Äôve got about 400 treasury notes so far
---
Thank you. I thought so, but wasn't sure and I'm away from my console.
---
Added, thanks!!
---
I'm drawn to your user name.  When I see it, I feel like I'm walking into an adult theater and that's what's on the marquee..... and I am ALL IN on that presidential performance.  Thank you for making my day a little brighter.
---
The sadder part about this post is I bet there are people who don't know who David Bowie is and will have to google him.
---
The daily ops gives me an average of 400 fuel when I use my flamer, with no pick ups
---
Agreed, in terms of gameplay they and rewards they've been solid, I just wish they were a little more mature in terms of content and tone. Telling a friend the objective is to help a guy make a really good BBQ, or to 'cause mischief' really undersells the fun and makes it seem like a kids game.
---
Yh I agree but it gets annoying when new plays expects 1000000+stims and to launch a nuke in five mins of leaving the vault but yh ti the people who give out stuff they are the real American heros
---
You sound like a politician now, walking back your answer.
---
Your original comment was you don't feel the need to spend your free time helping others with their special Ops even though you joined their special Ops team.
---
 You joined it for your selfish reasons which was a buff.  Not to actually help with the special Ops which is what the team was originally designed for.  If you don't see the douchebagery in that I don't feel the need to continue this conversation.
---
Dude I just can‚Äôt I solo‚Äôd an entire daily ops the other day in a full 4 man daily ops team üòÇ no one joined at any point during... it‚Äôs like the people who start/join public event teams BUT NEVER DO A PUBLIC EVENT
---
It's a welcome level boost to that event though, people can get legendaries they will use now...
---
Someone was spamming question emotes to me the other day in an ops team... now I know what he was probably looking for
---
You should work for Todd, 'cause it feels like you just suggested a simple fix that seems so logical it would be insane NOT to do it.
---
Same, this is the make or break for me too.
---
Yh me to I just hit level 50 and designed my camp to be like a hand out station free or 1 cap water,food and wepons it makes me happy knowing I'm helping
---
Well the fastest I‚Äôve ever done an ops is 5:02 &amp; I got my bond during that time (started the ops right after 3 joined my public team) so maybe ppl overthink how long it takes to get that bond?
---
Found a camp with like 20 of the industrial one all locked
---
Prices weren't bad tho. 2 caps per
---
no matter which fallout, soundtrack is always great :)
---
Yh its those type of players the community doesnt like. Like yesterday day I spent 1 hour farming junk and was looking for more before I went back and them level 112 came up and got in the way of my shooting and then one shot em and took all of it apart from the cloth
---
You can but either one or the other will suffer or you'll use all your legendary perk slots to achieve this.
---
I do a bit of both but I know I'm much weaker with the stealth side (commando for me) than the heavy weapons side.
---
Is mine more broken? The only two options on it are holidays and Bos supplies!
---
Oh definitely just seeing a different side of it maybe the lower level event would max out at 50 instead of 100 normally I wouldn't care but players were going down a lot and im a team player and hate to leave people down.
---
Kevduits next vid lol
---
This convinced me to finally make that stealth bloodied revolver pistol assassin build.
---
I often see people spend half the event emoting at drummers instead of cleaning up, that and folks afk'ing without doing anything will deplete the bar and fail the event even quicker. 
---
My strategy is usually, play drums or turn the spits pre event start, and keep on doing that IF the event is packed enough and people do their jobs. Otherwise I will leave my spot, pick up greens, spoiled leftovers, and poo, squish fires, and (what most people forget about) deposit wood as often as the game lets me.
---
But I can't save a failing event on my own; some folks will server-hop as soon as the event isn't about to finish within two minutes instead of helping, and the do-naughts will drain the bar quicker than I can fill it.
---
TL;DR: Freeloading is not an option at the Meat-Cook, swearing and emoting doesn't help, either, and drumming/roasting slows depletion, a lot. And the quickest events are those where all six seats are filled from the start.
---
Gt: Newsman77. Anyone can add me. I definitely need more Fallout Friends.
---
100% I‚Äôm in the same situation as you.
---
I used all my scrip today getting rid of 1 star legendaries,
---
Within a couple of hours I was back to maxed out stash.
---
Got max caps , loads of treasury notes..
---
Im assuming it's the same as the flaming war glaive and while it does put off light, it's not a substitute for a pip boy light or power armor light.
---
Dont even worry about people in lower tiered events. If they go down, thats their problem. If its like a Scorched Earth or something like that, revive.
---
Your a good man the community thanks u
---
&gt;Wtf is the point of creating a team if you're not gonna do the objective
---
I'll tell you exactly why - because the herd mentality mutation, empath mutation, and strange in numbers perk - all require you to have teammates.
---
If I can't get a team together otherwise, you bet I'm joining the DO team to prevent myself being nerfed.
---
And that's not my fault, that's on Bethesda's design choice of tying in Daily Ops group creation to public teams. They should rethink the system for arranging daily ops.
---
I feel like every player is required to have 5 points in Luck because of starched Gene's and bloody mess. There's just no reason not to have them.
---
I will do it again once I have better damage weapon so that lesser ammo will be used. 30 min is average timing mark for seasoned players eh?
---
Finding a daily Ops team to run with is a PITA.  On at least two occasions, I have spent 30+ minutes server hoping, trying to find a group.  I hate them.  Would not play the game if this was what the game was about.
---
You win reddit today! That made me totally smile. Love Labyrinth and Bowie.
---
You can only be on currency if you dead. Damn shame.
---
The BOS option is inferior to everything because it was free. Every collectron has different options they can use. As you buy more, those options become available. Running BOS collection is just a waste of time unless thats all you have.
---
True true, can anyone say If they have EVER taken out less than 20 gold tickets?  I once had 119 and thought about rounding it down to 100 but because the foundation daily gives 3 per it wasn't worth it lol
---
Yeah theyre busted still. I usually fire twice and jf they miss then leave vats and go back in and fire again and it usually hits.
---
I give most of the legendarys I get away. Have plenty of scrip. If u have 1000 notes then you really don‚Äôt need more do you and you can‚Äôt buy anything significant with caps so 30k is fine. As for scrip I like the idea of being able to exchange legendarys for something like notes and maybe increase the limit a day to 300. Other than that it‚Äôs fine as it is for me
---
It‚Äôd be less money early on for later control of the console sector. Nintendo covers a totally different gaming market and stadia isn‚Äôt really what we though it‚Äôd be, so Sony is the only major console competitor. MS is making plenty of money in PC sales alone.
---
MS has been making major moves well before this acquisition.
---
- Higher next gen specs 
---
- EA access with game pass
---
- A next gen console you can get for $200 with a 2-year game pass subscription
---
- 23 studios upcoming or well-known studios
---
- Azure and cloud gaming
---
- Testing in 3D augmented reality and AI tech
---
They have many of the necessary tools to rebrand gaming as a mainstay of pop culture, what they need are people using their tech so they can better improve their software moving forward. A short slump in sales could mean control of gaming and other markets later on down the line, which is why people assume they will be finding a way to ensure Sony can‚Äôt profit off their new titles. May not be exclusives, but they‚Äôve probably got bigger plans than just sticking their new acquisitions on gamepass and letting them waste away.
---
"This for that. That for this." 
---
\-Grahm the Supermutant
---
Depends on what is meant by "very effective". Soloing the queen - no chance. But can easily be effective for the vast majority of the rest of fallout.
---
I run 12 perception, 10 agility and 15 strength. I can easily switch out perks depending on what weapon I want to use. The legendary s.p.e.c.i.a.l perks are an added bonus as now I'm able to increase luck points too.
---
We went to Charleston, Huntington,Beckley, Lewisburg, Clifton Forge and then through VA's skyline drive and up to Harper's Ferry. I wanted to go up 79, but I knew we would have wanted to stop too much for our short trip. It gives us incentive to come back! I also wanted to see the capital building better, but it was under construction so I'll have to come back too see that as well
---
You guys have been saying that for a long time.  I mean, yeah, maybe one day. However, I question your definition of soon.
---
I've had it start only to magically disappear as we all were starting to gather items....but it did start. Definitely some bugs around it.
---
Always feed chally ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Is the only options are holiday and BOS supplies it probably means you‚Äôre already in the ‚Äúscrap‚Äù option
---
I haven‚Äôt been up to Harper‚Äôs Ferry but by all means come back and go to Dolly Sods and Spruce Knob I‚Äôm going to PM you some pictures from up there at Dolly Sods and Spruce Knob. Both beautiful places. You and your wife would love it there.
---
I know that they technically don't exist yet, but I would buy and fly the hell out of a NCR flag if they added it to the Atomic Shop.
---
Compete the obstacle course the high up one and watch them try follow haha
---
And when you come out of VATS the gun goes into a screwed up animation and prevents you from doing anything except holstering.  It's so buggy and the fact that it hasn't been fixed yet is ridiculous.
---
Walking back or explaining myself because I was attacked?  
---
Yes I don't feel the need.  You say that's what the team was originally designed for but I have joined ops teams where no one even started an op or made any inclination of starting an op.  I'm sure there are some folks out there who just play the game and mope around and don't even notice what type of team they are on.  I don't feel the desire to tell them or anyone else how they should be playing a game.
---
My original comment's intention was to let OP know that if you're going to rely on complete strangers in a game to do something or help with anything then you are going to be in for a bad time.  It's the same mentality as people who play WoW or ESO and use the dungeon finder to get a pick up group of randoms and then complain when the group isn't as good as they want.  
---
If you rely on complete strangers and then get mad when things don't turn out your way then this is your own fault.  It is true in 76, in other games and in life itself.
---
I keep him because he‚Äôs a BOS bot in my camp, I‚Äôll just switch him to scrap mode so he‚Äôs useful.
---
I'm pretty sure the quoted 80%/20% is the wrong way around. It seems like 20% you get something, and 80% you get nothing. That's been my experience anyway.
---
I forget sometimes especially with meat week going. We will finish an ops when jump to another event and it will be up to 30 mins later before i remember to change it back. 
---
Saying that I seem to only be getting level 2 and level 5s join my daily ops team and I'm sure as heaven not carrying 3 under level 20 players thru ops.
---
If you have the commitment it is. Just gotta get all the sources of rads you can unstable isotope mutations assaluttron head main glowing pustules irradiated food. It can make you hella tanky (especially glowing pustules) but the problem is that you gotta always keep the rads coming which is easier said then done. I went for a full ghoul build before I realised plauge Walker doesn't lock diseases

1. Take the game slow, don't rush content. Especially now with the level scaling of enemies.
---
2. Use melee to save ammo
---
3. If you don't want to PVP, turn ON pacifist mode in the game settings (it's per character, so you need to do this while in game on a character)
---
4. GL HF.

I love the track "16 Tonnes"
---
The line in it that goes:

If you see me comin', better step aside

A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died  
---
One fist of iron, the other of steel  
---
If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
---
I owe my soul to the company store 
---
It's like the ultimate farming song lmfao
---
They have the ncr ranger outfit in the game so already broke the lore there lol
---
I guess you could always... Kill Some Time.
---
Every sheepsquach I've killed this week had double everything. Legendaries, bones, meat, junk. All of it. Sometimes I get 4 pieces of meat from one.
---
Lmao get outta here ü§£
---
I'm down for some communist purge!
---
 get on there wanted list from splash dmg from my shotgun . i have always thought they should give up at some point
---
For me the saving grace is the new legendary perk Ammo...thingy, with ammo smith I make bulk ammo easy, so that's not an issue, just the constant missing makes the game a slog. 
---
I really should I guess just move on, dump all the gauss shotguns and go back to my trusty handmades. I'm being stubborn.
---
A duper on his alt was testing you. If you were to steal it he'd make your inventory disappear. &gt;!/s!&lt;
---
I‚Äôm almost wondering if they could redesign the flies so it‚Äôs similar to Minecraft
---
Well they could always make it a slideshow of pictures in your local camera photos/screenshots. (Local so it only shows yours, not other peoples as that'd be more rough to make possible)
---
Same goes for a Projector. Thanks Bethesda. You can pay me 1000 atoms for the idea.
---
I just built a smaller cabin and hid it away next to some water. I'll farm that throughout gaming and hand them out to low lvls. I didn't do the shop cause I just have basic stuff that's easy to find for anyone. I'm some kinda special on this game. I'll leave camp with the intention of doing a mission, 3 hours later I still haven't made to the mission  but circled the map 20 times lol I'll do the challenges a decent bit but if another level around mine isn't in the group I usually won't join. I don't have much of anything to drop them super fast and know time is an issue.

Read some of the comments definitely a noob. It‚Äôs easy to tell

True. I‚Äôve collected a lot of ammo in Daily Ops, so I can‚Äôt complain about ammo waste, but I want my enemies dead now, not after five misses in a row on the SBQ. Lol
---
Just did testing of this. I get the same damage whether I'm in vats or not. It just doesn't give me the message that the bonus is hitting in vats.
---
 Sneak is working perfectly fine for me in vats or out.
---
I had a guy selling an Instigating FFR LMG for like 500 caps. I tried offering him more and he refused. I felt bad but I tried telling him.
---
Yep it helps, but I just can't get a flow going in a mob fight, all the dicking about with VATS is a frustration. 
---
My go to now is a Vampire's gauss shotgun version, so at least when I get set on my multiple critters because I missed dozens of shots I do keep a sliver of health.
---
Bro, I used to love American Pickers and Pawn Stars. That's gotta be the golden age of History Channel Programming, back before it was all Aliens and Ice Road Truckers
---
i overthink a lot of things
---
Its the only time I want to put on my headset is when I make an D. Ops group and people join, and do nothing just so I can yell at em like a Mr. Gutsy!
---
DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER?!!? (pls just do the ops)
---
I did that the other day, picked up a bunch of plans that were just sitting on the ground only to get an angry message from the droppee, I ended up dropping all the plans I had on me because I couldn‚Äôt remember which ones I picked up
---
T-65 and strangler heart are worth getting in my opinion, even just to have if ever you might want the option. Having gotten both sets with the mods of my liking I am definitely running out of bullion plans to buy. 
---
You can always use gold for lunchboxes as well. I think it‚Äôs nice they added a gold sink for people who have everything they want.
---
Is it only in the social menu, or does it still think it's a daily ops group once you join and start getting the group bonus?
---
That, and now also.
---
I do uranium, blast away at a lvl 100 3* mole miner, needing to do far more dmg/bullets than previously and I get a useless 1* legendary. Atleast the previous lower 3* enemies gave us useless legendarys that would be worth more script.
---
Maybe they just can't fix it because of complications the every man/woman will never understand. 
---
Getting stuck in that animation/sound and locked up, no reload, no sprint etc.. üòíOh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My 25% fusion cores would like to disagree with your assessment.
---
You're welcome
---
What is the strangler heart one? What benefits does it have? I will prob get them both. Like the T-65 I was thinking about. On fallout 4 I was in PA all the time but for some reason never used it in 76 lol
---
My J33 misses all the time. I need to leave vats and renter. It says 95% hit. It‚Äôs broken op is right.
---
Shame but ultimately I guess this is a good thing
---
Snitches get stitches :)
---
You may be thinking about the [Ripper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ripper_(Fallout_76\))
---
When they wind up Austin and add flight sim to the game maybe they will fix some of the bugs at the same time.
---
Then we can fly gilders over Appalachia dropping nades on mobs!
---
I 100% agree, I learned all I know about negotiating from Rick. Although, I don't mind toking up and watching some ancient aliens lol
---
Yep. I wear it. hahah.
---
You are the one that seems upset. Monorails are everywhere. I've actually been on one in Japan that is the same as the one in FO76. There is one in Germany too, and probably other places. The train hangs from the track. Your drawing is a neat idea but it isn't even a monorail.
---
Most of it is childlike in nature and that's what makes it fun. Most real world festivals and carnival games are all childlike. I think most people just need to learn to take themselves less seriously. 
---
But what do I know, I'm just one of those filthy casuals. Haha
---
Maybe they can provide more money and personnel to the teams. But this is something that will take time. Hell they might even bring in some Obsidian peeps to work in a lot of the weapons &amp;mechanics.
---
I really don‚Äôt use power armor either to be honest I just like having them if I feel the need to switch up how I play. strangler heart adds a small amount of poison damage while also having really good damage and energy resistance stats. I believe it‚Äôs the only power armor with an added bonus damage like that.
---
Sometimes I buy water if it‚Äôs five caps if they have a really nice camp as a tip
---
People liked abusing this. Killing *anyone* outside of PvP is griefing, as is circumventing the mechanics to force PvP.
---
Im like 160 and soloed prime cuts in the cranberry bog. I think they made it easier since the last meat week.
---
Reminds me of these "totally-not-eight-years-old" kids who just randomly killed me while I was just trying to clear out someone else's workshop defense so I could get my event for the day done and everyone wants to just say they're raiders and cheese kill.
---
If you're gonna PVP me fucking fight me without a cheese meta.
---
Have to say I have tried gauss shotguns on the queen and gave that one up and just use a bloodied handmade or a mini gun, I just need to get the damage in so I have a chance of a drop of flux and repair kit.
---
oh hell yeah the hourly "don't go in daily ops if you not doing it" thread!!! see you guys in the next one!
---
Probably the same people who complained about people gonna nuke camps before the game even came out.
---
to be fair though the commie side is part of it as well, while I don't care for the armour reskings the Subjugator outfit is bomb
---
The thorn damage stacks with itself like pre SH nerf as well with talons.
---
Some of us hit a bowl and forget we‚Äôre in a daily ops team. Lol but yeah I know what your talking about. You go to the team and start an op only to be doing it yourself.
---
Me too!
---
Re ban everyone that dupped and perma ban them on Xbox live and ip ban them.
---
Completely agree with this. I attempted to do the daily ops last night. For 45 minutes all I did was server jump. Got bored and turned it off. So frustrating.
---
why don't you just create your own group
---
Also I like to have it set to casual team and switch to op team right before the boss.
---
AA lever action rifle or a semi handmade. Both were pretty shit against them.
---
But I got some advice in the comments and got me a vampires exploding full auto handmade and it seems to work a lot better.
---
Oh! Neat! Wait - I think you've got a camp in the Toxic Valley, right? I spent a solid thirty minutes trying to get a perfectly preserved pie in your diner!
---
Yes, if the private server is empty, all built workshop items disappear after the 10 or 15 minutes it takes to reset.
---
Imagine like a gauss rifle. But bigger and not as fast
---
as living in europe, i dont know the shows you mention but vendor hopping is always great. just today i found a spicy tendy mod for 10 caps. even got a bad feeling about that and offered him some ammo but he never responded, so, well....thanks? :D
---
YES THAT! I really shouldnt have thrown mine away lol
---
I joined a fresh daily ops team and started the op and after emoting for them to come here I was removed by the team leader
---
Check out nukes and dragons.
---
My Instigating Shotguns say hello
---
MS doesnt own shit yet.. theyve only agreed to a sale..
---
it is still a long way from actually going through
---
Often there aren't even enough critters for everyone, running around pointlessly while doing nothing is much worse than standing on a drum.
---
Forgot about instigating definitely king of the mob killers
---
Not if you like nw over adventure.  Wish it would the other way as well.  Lol. That way those of us that don‚Äôt like nw we can still. Lvl up. Lol.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
I should point out its a builder, but you can post what you build and get suggestions for improvement. I don't know if they have a database of "good" builds.
---
Hopefully when it goes through they will send some personnel to Bethesda and do something about the bugs. :)
---
The basic premise is that these two guys who are experts on antiques travel around the United States and purchase valuable antiques from people with collections of old things. They then resell these antiques for more money than they bought them. Can probably find it online, worth checking out.
---
if
---
Check thunder mountain substation for a glowing deathclaw, uranium fever event gets mole miners sometimes...they can spawn randomly
---
To me wouldn‚Äôt that free up much needed server space too? Some games crash due to too many meat piles.
---
Just saw someone mention it in a thread and was wondering now the patch has come out whats the pecking order looks like
---
This shit is getting annoying....."hey I know you have zero control of this organization for another 8-10months and you'll have much bigger fish to fry when you actually take over but could you fix a 3 year old mmo lite first"
---
Few people know that, while he greatly resembles President Lincoln, Lincoin was the inventor of the penny, which now bears his likeness.
---
Pray to the microsoft gods for salvation!
---
Yea. I have noobies message me as soon as they get in game. Asking for stuff. ü§î at least try. Lol guess we get it from both sides
---
I was on last night and I looked one minute pass the hour and it wasnt there. Either it didnt happen or it ended super fast
---
Or they might gut it and squeeze the last drops of blood from it because it would have ran its cycle.
---
Some people struggle with collecting resources and actually managing stash weight. Its easy to forget how many kids play this game.
---
I‚Äôd love damage logs &amp; Atom logs. Doesn‚Äôt need to be crazy but last 10 transactions/enemies would be great.
---
Yh most new players are nice others want free stuff and to be babyed through the game not being rude but u know what I meen
---
You know nothing John Snow
---
Instigating is best for one shot one kill attempts. Also pretty good for super fast rapid shot guns. Lmg with FFR tends to get 3-5 shots with double damage. 
---
Bloodied is better than aa if you can do or want low health. AA and junkies are best for high health builds.
---
Welcome to Appalachia!!
---
Ah thankyou! so not much changed there really XD
---
In the mire somewhere gonna gi hunting for it now
---
Black water mine at higher levels is full of glowing enemies.
---
Nope. Things are just much closer together so there is less pressure to always go bloodied.
---
If you fast travel away, and then fast travel back, they forget to be mad at you.
---
I live on the golf course and i have accidentally hit the assaultrons a few times while defending my camp.
---
Why are people downvoting this? This is literally the enclave's philosophy. They massacre people who managed to survive the great war so they can rebuild the nation "mutant free"
---
I feel like it would be an improvement if they had a matchmaking option for Daily Ops so you wouldn‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of forming/joining a team prior.
---
West virginia... MOUNTAIN MAMA!!!!!
---
Can't forget the classics.
---
How do you leave the group if your the leader on PC? shy of logging out I can't figure out how
---
Would be nice for bloodied to not always get fingers wagged at and constantly called too op. Looking at you vanguard junkie guys wanting that top dog place ;)
---
You‚Äôre right, it is, because that‚Äôs not what I said, or meant. My public team, I‚Äôll do what I want. You want a Daily Ops team? Start one. That‚Äôs what my post meant.
---
And yet every time this event happens there's people screaming on forums/reddit for folks to jump on the spits and drums. You can lead a horse to water lol
---
I‚Äôm a junky build so not starting at low heath. I have see the card show up and it didn‚Äôt end up helping. So I was just checking to see if it actually saves you when it goes off. I don‚Äôt really die all that often.  Cranberry Bog meat week has gotten me once when the OP was standing on top of the barrel and I was pulling creature back to him. I couldn‚Äôt rank 3 fog crawlers and a behemoth and it didn‚Äôt go off then. Other wise it the queen fight when she lands or earl fight. Or a Mireluke qeeen at the end of heat of the swamp.  I just unlocked 300 and added infiltrator and I have used that more than the PA reboot. I‚Äôll give it some more time now that I have the exta spot to see if it actually works when it goes off.
---
Just west of Camden park there is a railroad track with a broken cart. I usually run through it while doing the lucky mucker quest. I run by a glowing radroach living inside
---
Its all staged which makes it unwatchable for me .  Same with pawn stars, storagewars or any of those lets take 5 seconds to teach alittle history to the masses shows.
---
one wasteland makes it so you aren't carrying anymore, the mobs are lvl 2 for them if they are level 2
---
Course you are ya BoS supporter
---
Simple solution to that is don't add the incentive.
---
Where do I get it?
---
(If its the atomic shop outfit, I missed it.)
---
&gt; Explosive effect adds an explosion equal to 20% of your weapons damage and the game shows the total number on weapon card.
---
Fantastic - thanks. I don't think I've used an explosive weapon since 2018, so I couldn't remember if anything other than two-shot modified base displayed weapon damage.
---
&gt; Someone was very upset when they got that sale notification after you bought their item
---
I know that bug is out there, and I hope that's not the case. I wish this game provided some logging for purchases; I could go find the person I bought it from and confirm I didn't just snag a cherished weapon out of his stash. (It's only going to be a back-up weapon for me, anyway.)
---
True. I‚Äôm usually rocking an explosive medic‚Äôs Gatling gun during the fight. All I need is to get one hit in and I get something, right? Damage isn‚Äôt great but I‚Äôm there for flux and plans anyway. Not trying to be a hero. Lol
---
Whenever I go to the cookout, I always work the spit.
---
It could be fun if the TV's showed the loadingscreens of previous Fallout games, like that weird one of the family bowling in Fallout 3
---
Johny guitar would like a word.
---
Unfortunately that comment is outdated afaik. Slap damage was removed a long time ago
---
And the opposite can happen too. I was on a casual team that the leader then changed to an Ops Team and started waving us to join. I was going to join him even though I had already done mine, but the Meat Cook popped at the same time, so sorry buddy.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think that. Because first week of daily ops I joined a team, I‚Äôm level 330 and was with two 800+ players. We finished at 12 minutes because they didn‚Äôt want to melee. I then joined a team, one player was 20 other was 40. We finished elder on first run. I would run ops with those guys again way before higher levels. It seems the higher levels don‚Äôt want to do what needs to be done. But nope, lower levels will play way better. So don‚Äôt always judge lower levels
---
I‚Äôm not super high level but I sell my extra stuff for really cheap, specifically for newbies or people who really need it. There‚Äôs been times that high levels have come and emptied my machine. Out of curiosity; I went to a couple of their camps and more than once I saw stuff that I was also selling for a lot more there. I can‚Äôt be sure but I feel like they‚Äôve bought my stuff for low to sell high. Which would have been lame. This doesn‚Äôt feel like that game for that.
---
Nice! I def recommend doing it at least once the real way. What system are you on?
---
I've had a guy just drop me 100 energy bobbles for giving him a free magazine. So you know stranger things.
---
Do you recall what vendor sold the quad?
---
Idk if you're on or not but I'm down to do it rn. You'll have to message me on xbox because my notifications are off on there. üòå
---
Very possible. Focus on space fallout and medieval fallout. (Starfield &amp; Elder Scrolls)
---
That guy helped that event less than you did. 
---
Anyone on drums or spits is a winner at the game of Grahm, and deserves only the uppest of thumbs.
---
If you struggle to run 60fps on fallout 4 you will not have fun with fallout 76 id recommend playing it on console because you need a beast to run this game stable
---
Yesss! Haha that's me. That pie machine must have lower pie rates than any other one on the entire map. I had another camp w a pie machine in the ash heap and got a pie almost daily. Now I haven't gotten one myself at this camp haha.
---
yes
---
If you don‚Äôt mind farming flux in addition to lead and steel, then yes it‚Äôs worth it. And yeah with a bloodied lmg you want to prime that beast for sure.
---
If you could transfer stuff easily between characters you basically have infinite storage
---
I had somebody join my ops team, and I waited about 10mins for a 4th before just entering.  "I" created the Ops.  Which popped the start notice for the 1st person who joined shortly after.
---
The issue was, person 3, joined my ops team.....from an active Ops he was apparently just trying to solo.  So "I" started an ops, that was 15mins down on the timer.  Sure we still cleared it, but it left me with a bad taste with my limited playtimes needing to clear again for any of the rank clears.  
---
Both others dropped team at clear, so they didn't want to repeat.
---
I hate when people predict the death of 76, but elder scrolls will definitely hurt it quite a bit.
---
Thank you for this answer 
---
This game has a really nice and helpful community---but holy shit is it also full of entitled babies
---
Yeah, occasional visual glitch.  Yesterday all items I wanted to interact with were my husband's screen name.  I was gathering wood, and i must have picked up dozens of him.  I told him i did not think i could keep up with 2 dozen of him!
---
Honey, where are my shoes?  Honey, what's for dinner?  Have you seen my glasses?   
---
It would be as bad as the Gary's
---
Yeah, I had trouble finding it on PC as well. 
---
Go into the map, hit 'c' for the social menu. Switch to the social menu tab that lists the group members, and right click on your name. There's an option for "leave group".
---
I do it for strange in numbers if casual teams are full/there are none.
---
My specs should be able but it is a Bethesda game so ....
---
Larry‚Äôs Toxic has a glowing snally
---
They're all staged, to a degree. I always got the feeling that American Pickers was a little more authentic than pawn stars. Like, I don't think they're planting rare things in people's sheds/houses. Now Pawn Stars seems like they could just be grabbing shit out of the back and telling people to bring them in. I also would hope no one treats these shows as a legitimate history lesson lol
---
I always go to Abbie's bunker where there are glowing radroaches.
---
I personally agree the incentive is in the negatives. Why gimp an entire survival dynamic. Just like when they increased night visibility and made the night eyes perk completely redundant
---
I run Vampire Gat Plasma because the ammo is extremely easy to get and also run uny and I love my build. Absolutely amazing. Cores are pretty cheap too and only way 1 compared to fusion cores which are 3 each.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs no point in farming special op events. 
---
**Incorrect.** Daily Ops reliably drop two- and three-star legendaries upon completion. If you've got the rhythm down, getting a legendary every 6-7 minutes is one of the fastest and most reliable ways to grind for legendaries.
---
I've personally fallen in love with the two shot explosive gatling, it's not the best weapon out there but it just is satisfying to use when it goes thunk thunk thunk.
---
Fusion core wise, I'd say just take over a power station, hook up the fusion core generator and go collect every now and then.
---
Personally I've been rolling in the semi bloodied build (health at around 30-50%) and been having no issues with the unyielding etc.
---
It was a player vendor. There is no sure fire way to get a QE Railway Rifle. You either have to get one from a Legendary/the Purveyor, or buy it off a player who did.
---
Don‚Äôt remember the player‚Äôs name though, if that was your question.
---
If you don't care for graphics you could turn everything low. 
---
Bugs are present but nothing like they were, no game breaking ones I know of.
---
If you liked fo4 you would like 76. 76 has alot more end game, community wise or solo if desired. Not much else to say.
---
5 characters x 800 lbs = 4000 lbs
---
Other items can still be moved back and forth between characters.   If you have a trusted friend to hold your stuff, it's easiest.   But leaving items in a world container or getting a courier are also options.
---
Both my characters know all the same atom shop item plans, so we know the coding can be done.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you play Nuclear Winter, but my girlfriend and I play it a lot. There are people like us who play every night. That 30 second godmode you suggested would be terrible to fight against. We play on console, but with the gauss shotgun as the meta right now, that plus your suggestion would make the gauss shotgun unstoppable. We don‚Äôt need that.
---
As for finding a treasure hunter in NW, maybe if the reward was some unique cosmetics you can only get in NW, like the leveling up system or those limited time events during Halloween, Christmas, etc., that would be great. No godmode, please.
---
Yeah the TSE Gatling is kinda expensive though
---
Thx for help with the fusion cores btw
---
either youre lying or youre not a casual player. theres no reason my mid level character with 4 points in damage output should be getting its ass kicked while my high level character with the same number of points in damage output is still overpowered.
---
90 percent of the time they will be glowing but occasionally they aren't.  If they are, you can generally find 2 more in the restrooms nearest to the vendor bot as well.
---
God I hate that so much, I'll join a group and sit there for 10-15 mins without anyone doing anything ..
---
Yes! I died when the named ghoul came out lol
---
If you're the second person, yes. If you're the third or fourth person? Not really. 2 experienced players can get Elder rank pretty easily in my experience, but one tends to struggle. If you want to tag along at low level then feel free, so long as you're having fun and there is that second experienced player.
---
I had this happen with a scorchbeast in the mire before meat week started.
---
Not up all night but I get up at like 1am. And all my homies have moved on from this game so my private server is always just me, farming for fusion cores.
---
I know that I've taken up a mission since Patch 22 to help mid and low level players. I've been giving out legendary weapons and armor,  Stims, chems, water and food. The weapons and armor are items that I've got stashed to grind up, literally hundreds of them. They're certainly not god tier but for someone with no legendary items they must seem like they are. Especially with Spec Ops now a lot of us are getting decent, if not top end, weapons that most of us just grind up...why not drop a couple to some mid-level folks instead?
---
I do have 40+ stable flux in stash so it does seem like the logical path. thanks
---
yeah its the mid levels that are the problem. this has veen pretty much proven at this point.
---
Resilient day I just take whatever level I can get..they just eat through my armor like I'm naked
---
Can you only have 5 characters max? And yea i also hate the fact that my new character has to learn every plan again
---
Bloodied lead pipe and a vamps Gatling laser from one thing. And an unyielding marine leg.
---
I've been finding scrip legendary items in loot bags, but using that duffle seems like a safer option.  Should not despawn as quickly.  üëç
---
A for 1 to 6. Nike (just do it).
---
I am not going to lie, I only decided on this because of Wasteland patch coincided with steam summer sale. Over 240 hours in. No regerts! Yup.
---
Edit: 1660 super, 6th gen i5. High default is 60fps solid. Old 960 ran med just fine too.
---
Bloodied Stumps aren‚Äôt good in the new meta.
---
5 characters per account / platform.  So if you only play on xbox, on your real account, that is 5 characters.
---
I have heard of people playing on 2 consoles with 2 accounts, so that would be 10 characters.
---
And here I was picturing the turrets on the bottom of WWII bombers ü§£
---
The thing about the War Glaive plan is that it and the actual weapons are the ONLY Daily Ops reward that isn't tradable...which is weird considering that its arguably one of the least good rewards (worst is Whisper in the Dark plan).
---
GAAAAAAARYYYYY!
---
I think you go to your own name on the team list and remove yourself just like normal
---
Haha. I hear ya. That's why I love my tesla rifle. I guess it's jury rigged nature makes it hold better than most. With gunsmith 5, it's a beast. My plasma flamer... not so much. üòÜ
---
it was an atom shop item that came out with wild Appalachia and i believe its been taken out of the shop as bethesda like to do
---
That's not true, the bar will continue to drop if no one is jamming out or cooking. It's like trying to fill a leaky tire with air if no one is doing those things.
---
Fallout 76 turns 2 years old this November.
---
Hey there, love the write up, sent you a pm about the bear arm plans. Cheers
---
Honestly, if you've joined an OPs team, and can't join the OP pretty much immediately then you shouldn't have joined an OPs team. I'm lvl 311, and I'm tired of joining/starting an OPs team where either no one jumps in, or I get a bunch of idiots who won't follow, or stay on objectives. It's an 8min activity, for fucks sake.
---
Yes, just like some of the big events, completing daily ops always awards you legendary weapons/armor. Useful for people that can‚Äôt hit daily script most of the time. 
---
Useless to people that reach max script and gold within an hour of playing.
---
Ok but also don‚Äôt be so hasty I‚Äôve started a daily ops team so many times and had people start it when there‚Äôs just 2 of us on the team, I want to wait for more people to join
---
I joined a team last night to get my daily done and then it was completed. That was not my fault. Just saying.
---
I like doing the daily op w a team
---
I agree but one night I made friends and the leader turned it into an events team and we took out like 10 scorch beasts that night. It was great
---
Rad bundle.
---
Imo it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. The damage bonus is good enough, but you also craft quite a bit of ultracite .308 vs regular .308. It uses fluorescent flux I believe, which is very easy to farm in a whitespring nuke zone. 
---
My bloody prime LMG devastates boss enemies. But I still prefer my .50 mg because it doesnt need to be reloaded as often.
---
It‚Äôs a train wreck. But it‚Äôs OUR train wreck.
---
Like others are saying, enemies scale on person to person basis now. But even then, so long as it isn't the melee to kill modifier, I can manage to elder all on my own so long as I'm actually trying. I'm level 279 or so.
---
I'm sure. I just meant that hey should have altered it's design to be similar to meat piles. I'm assuming they didn't, because if they did, only your character would see them, which would seem odd when an enemy disintegrates or gooifies and they seem to disappear to everyone, but you.

---
Well there's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights (would work just as well with ts or aa) . Been running this build for 250 odd levels now and love it
---
Note that 5 points of luck are from a legendary perk
---
Just 1 example for ya
---
Alt + F4. That's the only one i have found.
---
Not being able to repair things until they‚Äôre fully destroyed is such a weird design choice
---
I‚Äôve recently played through both fallout 4, and 76. I‚Äôve found the gameplay of 76 to be different, but not in a bad way
---
For myself, I wanted to play this game solo, but I do find it hard when everyone on the map is doing the local events, because I want in! I find myself prioritizing events and C.A.M.P building over the quest line. 
---
I run fallout 4 on ultra with little to no frame drops, but 76 on high I get some frame drops. Nothing too bad, or at least bad enough to make the game unplayable. 
---
I do find this game to be a little more MMO leaning for some content, unless you creat a build for solo and you spend some time grinding out the gear you need. But it‚Äôs so satisfying when you one tap an enemy everyone else is having problems with. 
---
So, I personally love camp building, and running events with some friends to get the fun seasonal items, and even just exploring the new world. 
---
I‚Äôd say, get it on Xbox game pass for pc and give it a try before you buy
---
Yeah, those would be amazing too. Just simple things to make our Wasteland lives easier lol
---
As a 76 noob (just started playing on Thursday), I support this statement. I also hope to get good enough to start giving to noobs myself.
---
The drums and spits feel like they help more then the other stuff tbh
---
Do we really need 4 different ways to show corpses? Corpse and meat pile is all we need. Is the game any better because this weapon makes a different loot container?
---
Final word with all heavy gunner perks for me.
---
Yes and Microsoft takes over Q2 or Q3 in 2021.....
---
I like to leave the shovel where it blends in, since I have the gravestone drop bag.  Look to see if there a smaller gravestone where there shouldn't be.
---
They might have been waiting on a friend to join their team or switch to an alt. We (friends and I) do this to increase chances of rare stuff.
---
I can‚Äôt remember the name of it to save my life. But there are ALWAYS glowing mole miners in this area. 
---
You‚Äôre familiar with whitespring right? If you looo in the map, there will be a train station to the right of whitepsring. The next map point right next to the train station on the right, has glowing mole miners. 
---
It‚Äôs the area where uranium fever event spawns.
---
I am on pc, so I'm just going to wander around until I find some people that want to do it with me, or maybe ask on here who knows.
---
Use nukes and dragons to plot out your  character only choose the damage dealing perks and support to damage dealing perks first and once you have there is a levelling tool at the bottom of the page which tells you where to spen perk and special points
---
That would be cool but wouldn‚Äôt that mean someone in the wasteland has to be broadcasting it? And would tv need satellites are those even still in orbit?
---
Yeah but it's brilliant for farming hard to craft ammo. Switch to the relevant gun, bash 'em and be the hero who finishes them all off, then hoover up the free ammo.
---
He's making a suggestion on how it should work, not telling you that it currently works this way.
---
They actually do send out a production team ahead of the visit.  Ensure that you have items, a cool story, and stage the areas......
---
Fucking same. Doesnt what my health or armor look like, I get destroyed by the resilient robots
---
A lot of the time 2 or 3 of us get towards the end and the last person joins. They know what they're doing.
---
That event is kind of in too tight a space to play Responder. But that‚Äôs really awesome that you‚Äôre reviving folks. I‚Äôve started to move more toward that as a secondary role myself. You could consider if you have the perk cards and Charisma sharing the Mysterious Savior one. I have mine set to level 3 and while I don‚Äôt know how many other people that guy has saved, it‚Äôs brought me back more often than I expected.
---
I got it a few weeks ago, hope to see you there!
---
We‚Äôll be waiting for you in the wasteland!!
---
If I ever start a daily ops team and lets say there's 3 people, I'll start it. And if someone happens to join as we started it, oh well. You snooze you lose join quicker. 
---
But I absolutely hate when people join the team and then just hang out at the front.
---
You on Xbox? If so I‚Äôll see if I want to buy any ammo from there. I‚Äôm looking for some .50 rounds.
---
Ah. I got a little lost in your sarcastic quote because it starts talking about the present, but then it references the future. 
---
My bad.
---
Bolstering bonus kicks in at low health, yet you mentioned you wanted to go with a bolstering/high health build.  Don't you think vanguard armor (bonus at high health) would be better suited for that?
---
For my heavy gunner I am using an AA gatling for trash mobs and The Final Word (lvl 50 aa/ff .50 Cal Mchine Gun) for serious content. The .50 cal eats up the ammo fast, so I try not to use it often.   Since the patch I am running PA, and before I was 4 pieces of UNY, 1 Bol.  I felt too soft after the patch so went with Angry Turtle Heavy Gunner PA build.
---
It's those fucking gutsys. They get the weapon damage a player their level should have..and that damn boss at the end...an assualtron in power armor with DUAL miniguns? F.M.L
---
Gotta protect them from the asshats using the take one for the team bug that auto initiates pvp more so.
---
I was afk on the drums to get some xp for my new character and wake up to some guy killing me.
---
Tell em to put passive on.
---
As another guy mentioned, do Beckett's questline and he'll give you The Final Word, an Anti Armor Faster Fire +250 DR while reloading 50 cal. It's about as good as you can do without trading for the god rolls.
---
If you're looking for something to get in the long run that's a good endgame gun I recommend a Bloodied Faster Fire Faster Reload 50 cal, or a Vampire's Faster Fire Faster Reload 50 cal.
---
That's what I was thinking. Sitting at the craft bench spamming craft watching the lead/steel go down is becoming tiresome.
---
I run my gatling plasma for boss encounters mostly but like the lmg for quick bursting general mobs. With the faster reload and perk it reloads very quick.
---
Uranium Fever or Radiation Rumble events. Every enemy is glowing.
---
I have a theory that I forgot to record, but it seems to happen if you look at their loot than look away.
---
Try testing it.
---
Definitely prime it. Run Daily Ops and take the time to loot all your kills at the end and you'll walk away with a surplus of ammo, eliminating the need to farm flux (which is a pain in the ass imo).
---
The last Legendary Run had the same issue. A few cool space-themed items, but not enough throughout. Skins are alright this time around, but I wish the rewards were more closely associated to the theme of the board.
---
Mister fiiiiive by five. Five feet tall and five feet wide.
---
Well it just gets less diverse, everyone runs in full hp with similar weapons now. In a public team there‚Äôs very few still use low hp builds. No more needs for ‚Äòbuilds‚Äô, just get a usable weapon (AAE TSE) and you‚Äôre as good as everyone elseüëå
---
Don't forget the XP bonus that you get afterwards. We usually keep the team on Daily Ops after completing it for that 100% XP bonus. That said, we're usually in a 4 person team, so it's unlikely that somebody who wants to run an Op joins us.
---
Those level 100 bastards are harder to kill than a level 100 super mutant and do more damage.  The mole rats also do more damage at level 100.
---
This one wasteland balance is whack.
---
There are plenty of points to farm the daily ops, ammo being the biggest, followed by stims and leg weapons.  But ammo, MY GOD THE AMMO!!  I farmed over 10k shotgun shells a few days ago it was glorious
---
Yeah I agree. And I mostly want a Tesla skin cause I use Tesla all the time for events and ops
---
emergency broadcast sugnal when switchedon.   that would be cool
---
For me the most important mod of all is Perk Loadout Manager. I am constantly micromanaging my perk loadout depending on what I am doing in the game, and without Loadout Manager the game would be too tedious to play for me.
---
Look up AngryTurtle on YouTube. He just put out a great full health heavy gunner build.
---
So smart investment would be maxing out the legendary ammo perk like I did and then have the reg ammo perk maxed and super duper maxed out. You get so much ammo it‚Äôs def worth it now. For example before legendary perks I would get 3 ult plasma cores for 3 regular ones and now I get 9 for 2 and that‚Äôs before super duper hits. I had 10 reg cores the other day just from playing a couple hours I went and changed to ult I had 50 by the end of it. And I use one yellowcake for 9 ult cores. So easy
---
I  didn't think of that. Thought for some reason it wouldn't drop prime ammo.
---
Yeah, we enjoy the 100% XP bonus, tyvm. That said, we're usually in a 4 person team, so it's unlikely that somebody who wants to run an Op joins us.
---
It‚Äôs better to switch as you use different trees , 1 full build is much better than 2 half builds
---
Yes cause people deposit 2/3 critters each, collect 20 then deposit you'll finish this trash event in a min or two. Play the drums before it starts, deposit 20/30 critter chunks and you are done.. the bar will never drop fast enough to make the event fail
---
Btw would be nice to see all of you running project paradise with the same interest... but heyyyyy it's too hard :(
---
Enjoy what Fate put in your path üòé Use an automatic receiver on it, equip ground pounder and dodgy and run around blowing up all the baddies around üòÅ
---
Goto black water mine or whatever it‚Äôs called all mole miners are glowing there or do uranium fever
---
What about flags for other Bethesda games? I‚Äôd pay atoms for a flag with a skyrim logo or something
---
There's theory that they just took skin sets they were gonna put in the atom shop and spread it over the board
---
No worries.  If your not in my brain my words don't translate well I've been told by my wife(lots).  And I did get alittle ahead of myself it will only be about 2.5 years when they take over, but i share the same opinion FO76 had little bearing in the 7.5 billion they agreed to pay and therefore will not receive much if any support in the first 3-6 months.
---
She told me that All. The. Time.
---
But then i live right near a spawn point.  Raider Punk is far less annoying, IMO.
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd move a helluva lot faster if you‚Äôd keep yer eyes off me arse.‚Äù
---
So far I have 3 in the legendary perk and all the regular ones on swap.
---
I'm currently running je25 hm but I have a je minigun and je gat laser what would be better?
---
You can sometimes get it if you look at it at just the right angle.
---
Same with when meat piles are near the turrets at rad rumble.
---
First of all. Doing multiple daily ops doesn‚Äôt mean you have a chance of getting a rare reward every single time. You know that right? 
---
There are 3 tiers of rewards. Initiate. Paladin. And elder. 
---
You get your basic legendary weapon/armor reward, along with ammo for simply completing the mission. 
---
You have a small chance of getting a rare reward as initiate. 
---
A medium chance as paladin. 
---
And a large chance as elder. 
---
If you beat it under paladin, you also get the reward for initiate. 
---
If you beat it under elder, you also get the rewards for paladin and initiate. 
---
So let‚Äôs just pretend you just logged on for the first time. And you beat it on elder on your first try. 
---
You CAN be lucky enough and unlock 3 rare rewards. If you were lucky to get a rare reward for all 3 tiers that you basically just completed. 
---
Or you can get 1/3 of the rewards, maybe 2/3 of the rewards. Or you might have really crappy luck and get 0/3 rewards. 
---
That‚Äôs why every time you complete a daily ops, the last page of the mission review will say ‚Äúalready completed‚Äù on each rank. 
---
So again, to summarize. If you beat it on elder the first time. Whatever rare rewards you got, that‚Äôs it for the day. Either you got zero rare rewards. , 1 out of 3 rewards. 2 out of 3 rewards. Or 3 out of 3. (Only happened to me once)
---
After that, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you do daily ops 500 more times. You will not get another chance at a rare plan.
---
That quest was fantastic. The novelty would probably wear out if I had to do it again on alts or something though
---
Project paradise can be done solo so I'm not sure what you on about being to hard.
---
Todd‚Äôs Stinky Piles?
---
Iv always loved fallout but skipped FO76 at first. Eventually in quanrantine me and my friends wanted something new to play and fallout got the wastelanders update so we ordered tricentenial copies for like $12 each free shipping on ebay and figured even if its bad we didnt spend to much. Needless to say we got addicted and now im on everyday completing the challenges and sitting at lvl 207 lol
---
Of course. They glow! Duh. Everybody likes glowy things. üòÜ
---
I've got a Vampire FFR Gatling Gun with the speedy receiver so it actually churns out rounds at a decent rate. When I want to melt stuff, I have an AA Primed Gatling Plasma (I can't remember the other 2 stars, I think one is bash damage). Ultracite Plasma Cores are super easy to get with 2\* ammosmith and the ammo factory legendary perk. I can turn 2 cores and 1 stable yellowcake flux into 6 ultracite cores and I haven't maxed out ammo factory.
---
Right, but the people have the items and stories already. They aren't fabricated is what I'm saying.
---
So I had a 1525 aa handmade forever now and barely used it once I got bloodied guns. I will say I can see it doing more damage now on higher enemies then other weapons. I‚Äôve been getting a crap ton of them to drop from legendaries and purveyor. Got a anti armor explosive light machine gun from purveyor other day, just got a anti armor grog axe from an event 3 star. Got a 3 star anti armor 10mm sub so they‚Äôre nice to play with now
---
Then you should be good
---
I play for on medium because of crashes, the difference between ultra and medium is not that big and I get a frame maybe 5 frames less, but that is not predictable. Sometimes constant 60 and other times struggle to get 40 in the same area
---
I like heavy so I‚Äôm biased! 
---
The only thing I‚Äôd say is both those heavies have a spin up time which can get annoying .
---
Junkies is a ‚Äòmagic‚Äô prefix so it might be worth while trying them at some of the meat week events and see if you like them
---
If they do implement this I'm sure in do time an exploit will be found to get your item free.
---
I'd rather trust the karma system in the trading sub.
---
I've junked for a good chunk of my life and every episode I watch I still hope the dude with the pony tail finds a bees nest or a rabid racoon as he is rummaging like a circus bear in some old guys life work for couple hundred dollars.
---
Edit: Spelling and Michigan Public Education are not a classic combo.
---
Living up to that Responders flair you've got. Really cool gesture, I hope you can make a few days with this! Cheers man.
---
Oh - always thought he was a German Shepard or a Belgian Malinois
---
I only ever play the drums if 1 person or nobody is playing them. That way the bar for meet week slows down a little.
---
Raider here, fuck those greedy cunts. I used to leave free .44, .10mm, and .38 in my vendor. I got tired of high lvl dicks taking it all. I get it, you use a bloodied .38 gun to kill trash mobs, but have some fucking pride. If you're over lvl100, and need free low lvl ammo, then you suck at the game.
---
The nerfed "unarmed".
---
You think it would be best to fully move my points from perception over to strength?
---
Yes. I hope they don‚Äôt change that at all. I use my bloodied 5mm Gatling gun. Kill every enemy in 2-3 bullets. And they always drop between 10-60 bullets for me. Same with my bloodied pump shotgun. 
---
Stimpacks are good to farm, because after 2-3 runs I end up having so many that I end up selling them to the vendor and making easy 1,400 caps. Along with the radaway they drop as well.
---
I solo it every single time my friend, was referred to people rushing to meat cook and ducking PP cause it has like... enemies. And the point is the same: kill stuff, collect stuff, deposit stuff.
---
Northwest-ish Cranberry Bog, down from the General's Steakhouse IIRC.
---
Nope, smoke break and drum time.
---
Actually its changed from LAPD to CPD (Charleston PD) on the chest, and was "standard riot gear" . Last part makes me mad we cant get it in game then though.
---
I know I only have one chance at them per day, what I'm asking is, do I have really bad luck not to get a single reward with 80% chance or am I getting screwed over for some odd reason.
---
If it‚Äôs any consolation I got the plan today ..it‚Äôs my 3rd meat week!
---
How much xp? Have like 515
---
Grab a magic weapon. They are great but might be hard to find or a bit expensive. If you can't find one judt grab a vampires heavy weapon. I personally use ultracite gatling lasers and use INT perks that help with fusion cores.
---
Agreed with everyone else. It's absolutely worth it. I don't farm Flux basically at all but I still end up with enough.
---
I feel like characters that are from beta end up being cursed in some way...
---
No problem. It's kinda near one of those pink groves I think, too.
---
Appreciate that bud, karma to you. 
---
I have to many and I just can't drop them lol.
---
You do know that you get a free legendary every time?
---
Yeah, well, I've done elder runs every day since it came out on 3 accounts one from beta and haven't had anything drop at all, kinda BS at this point
---
I tend to agree. FO76 really only exists as a money stabilization asset. Bethesda wanted a pretty cool idea: another, but lesser MMO than Elder Scrolls Online. So they whipped up a team, copied and pasted FO4, and made it exploitable as hell for micro-transactions. 
---
They did enough of the work to make it feel decent enough as a Fallout entry, but not much more than that. Probably had to reluctantly drop another sum to stabilize it post launch. But overall, this game is just to tide folks over until Elder Scrolls 6 and StarField.
---
I was kicked off a team just before the boss fight a couple of days back... on course for Elder rank as well.
---
Done it five times...it maintains its distinct qualities
---
my level 28 character joined one and a level 319 did the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote to the exit. when i completed it doing what i was supposed to do without dying once he sure was quiet
---
I've been using it this last week. Doesn't give off enough light to see anything around you, but you can see it on your character model. So basically, it's a light source, but with a very, very short radius.
---
I‚Äôve done it and it‚Äôs PITA, how many points do you have saved up?
---
I‚Äôd run the heavy weapons at an even and see if you like them, if you do either move change builds or start another character and go for a strength build from the start.
---
I was in a casual team doing my thing and then I noticed the other two members were in a Daily Ops. But confused but what the hell, I joined em. Still was in the first part of it. Should have read what it was before I joined. Resilient robots. But we finished it
---
Any legendary has a chance to be something you want as well. A lot more reliable than waiting for events or hunting for them.
---
Plus the other benefits.
---
Smoke break, I can give you that
---
If you have a ton of perk card coins, you can spend them to upgrade the legendary special slots which will make this possible. Of not, then it's best to pick one over the other.
---
Be careful with a lot of the older builds that are out there, since the One Wasteland patch earlier this month changed things up a bit. They can be used as a general guide, but may need some optimization to account for the changes in damage calculations. Angry turtle has some good builds and he has updated and done new videos for some since the update.
---
Eh I have none saved up just finished building my commando but don't really like the end result thats why this question arises because I love heavy
---
One other point to consider.
---
Strength open up 3 melee styles and shotgunner as well as heavy guns
---
I got a Quad, FFR, 15% loading speed Tesla for 2050 caps from a player vendor.  Don't know what his level was but looked at it three times because I couldn't believe what I was seeing and then bought it, took to his weapon bench and made it auto. (60 rounds).  Don't know if he didn't know what he had or left out a 0 when he set the price.
---
See I've had mixed results with that. I use escape artist anyway for the shroud effect and used to run ultra lite on legs. But I was getting noticed a lot just walking past stuff crouched. Switched to muffled and I can walk right up to enemies now without breaking hidden. Angry Turtle claims you don't need muffled and nine times out of ten I agree with him, but data miners have shown that muffled and escape artist don't effect the same enemy metric. So again I'm kind of up in the air about it but my own anecdotal evidence suggests muffled makes a big difference.
---
There's a dude with a pony tail? I don't watch the show religiously, but I only know of Frank and Mike. Seems like a cool hobby/profession to get into. I've only met a few people from Michigan, but that definitely checks out..lol jk bud.
---
It sure does. The only thing that doesn't drop are fusion and plasma cores.
---
As far as saying if it will run on your rig, I can't answer that but to answer your other questions. Gameplay is fun, very similar to other Fallout games. Bugs and glitches are present, it is a Bethesda game after all lol. Nothing to game breaking but it will frustrate and piss you off lol. Be aware, which I'm sure you are. This is an open world Fallout game. Unless you spring for Fallout 1st to be able to play in your own private world. You will be playing with others. You'll have to do events together and you'll run into them around the wasteland. Some will be cool and actually help. Some will be dbags and try to kill you and engage in PVP constantly (pacifist will be your best friend) They can also destroy your camp that you built, so be aware. You'll run into this and griefers every now and then. As far as things to do in this game, there is a lot but it's very easy for you to be able to complete the quest in a few days. The Wastelanders dlc only took a few hours. Also, once you reach a certain level in this game. It becomes boring (my opinion) You'll run out of things to do. Unless you jump on the gold bullion and legendary scrip grind band wagon. I'm almost a level 300, I have endgame weapons, armor, I know every plan, etc.. That's not a brag, I'm just trying to let you know. Once you get up in level, you'll run out of reasons to play the game. Also, the one wasteland update will make it harder for you to grind for levels. Everything scales to your level. At a lower level straight out the vault, everything feels like a bullet sponge. So there's no more easy grind for levels. Just to let you know I'm not saying don't buy it and I'm not crapping on this game. I do like it and I've been a Fallout fan since 3 but it's one of those games where you need to be aware of just what you're getting into.
---
Is it enough to hit it with the dart then kill with a gun? Or does it have to kill the critter?
---
Right, but change the team to casual so you can get a bonus thats actually  going to benefit you.
---
Two different ways to do this and it's simple.  
---
 \#1 take the perk power user under intelligence   
---
\#2 The higher your intelligence you have when crafting ammo at the chem bench the more of a over charged round you will create.  
---
Sidenote: Your gun will treat the overcharged round like two rounds of ammo, it will burn through the first "over charged" round and then create a 2nd round that is a normal round. But each round will be effected by the power user perk.
---
Aren't they randomly generated though? It didn't seem to get that way last season.
---
What level are you?
---
Keep in mind there is a double XP weekend in the next few months and with the current build leveling is much quicker
---
Why!?!??üò´
---
189
---
WE DID IT
---
Yes. Just like most of the impotent events you participate in. Along with the ammo. Stimpacks. Etc.
---
Not by any means a new player but.. you don't by any chance have the barbed walking cane plan sitting around in there do you?  It is one of the 3 plans I need to have every plan known in the game on my main.
---
In that case save up points and make the switch.. you‚Äôll probably need 30 to 40 though
---
Great tip!
---
Just ask if you want some decent starter gear and tips on build direction.
---
I am partial to Ol' Man Mose
---
yeah, itz not exactly the bees knees when folks do that.
---
lol paranoid much?
---
Only if they make it like old school death match where you have to find your gear and your perks don't matter.
---
I'll take a look and let you know!
---
Imma gonna have to stop you here. Flies are the only way to find meat piles in The Bog.
---
I started just under 2 months ago. A big fan of Fallout but generally stay away from online multiplayer. Since I started after Wastelanders it has always been a great experience for me. I‚Äôve also found the community to be, for the most part, amazing. Much different from usually turns me off from multiplayer games. I‚Äôve been having so much fun I‚Äôm closing in on level 200 already :)
---
Blackwater Mine! :)
---
The one for killing creatures in NW sure got increased, same with picking locks.
---
That quest was frustrating but also awesome.  
---
Am an aussie who moved to the USA a few years ago for work. So I knew the reputation of the DMV from pop culture. I was assuming that was an exaggeration. But no the DMV absolutely lived up to its reputation
---
Ah, it was so simple yet I couldn‚Äôt remember. Thank you.
---
Same here I crafted 7 ultracite plasma cores for each bit of flux today 
---
I doubt there is a cheaper way to get ammo at the moment
---
I do play NW and that's why I said only 30 seconds maybe even less and compared it to pacman vs the ghosts. 
---
Imagine 40 people rushing to try to find it, then only one gets it and immediately tries to plow through everyone who starts running away but better hope they kill everyone before the timer runs out. 
---
Also for every great player that gets it there's going to be 10 lvl 2 players that get it and just still run and hide in a bush. 
---
Honestly most people wouldn't care as much about a quick death in NW so much if it wasn't a 5 min reload process to get back into game. I think the wait list queue is the real killer of the mode.
---
VATS is bugged for all weapons, but even more so for Gauss weapons. My Gauss pistol will miss in VATS at point blank range repeatedly. I have much better success with it ADS. Its been acknowledged and I don't think they know how to fix it.
---
No. What made you think that?
---
No problem at all! It's always the simple names! Thank-you kindly for the award!
---
I crash at least 5+ time a day on xbox, many timesit freezes for a good 3 seconds, and add in some infinite loading screens for flavor.
---
It is scrapped already, broken down into components. Except the quest item with the diamond next to it.
---
Nope, sorry. You can reach, but there's nothing to grab.
---
You can‚Äôt scrap that because it‚Äôs already been scrapped.  
---
For example. Let‚Äôs say you have a gun, when you scrap it you‚Äôll get ‚Äústeel‚Äù
---
When you scrap an aluminum can you‚Äôll get ‚Äúaluminum ‚Äù
---
Got you!
---
Thank you very much :)
---
I'm still learning.
---
Right now the primal cuts in the ash heap has glowing crickets.  Also try big bend tunnel.
---
You only have scrap and quest items. Nothing will show up.
---
My current set up as a heavy weapons user is this (though be mindful I did some reading around and it got a little expensive):
---
*Anti-Armor Gatling Gun 
---
*Anti-Armor LMG (Primed)
---
*Final Word (Primed)
---
*Anti-Armor Gauss Minigun
---
*Furious Plasma Caster (Primed)
---
*Vampire's Gatling Laser (Primed)
---
*Furious Gatling Plasma (Primed)
---
Since most of my weapons are primed, ammo does happen to get expensive. Luckily I have the Ammo Factory legendary perk, which stacked with Ammosmith can make enough ammo to supply an army.
---
Thank-you, mate, I hope the wasteland both on and offline stays kind to you! 
---
(And I totally get you. I have a problem of hoarding anything I think someone could use.)
---
The ole triple tap on the VATS key.
---
And add wood to the pile of sticks to keep the spits a burnin'
---
No worries mate. üëç
---
I always start my own then kick those that don‚Äôt participate.
---
Good call brother.
---
Go to the military wing and then the command center in the white springs bunker. Start the mission at the computer that allows you to find a key card. Go grab your key card, then head to any of the three silos. Go through the silo like the first time and when at the end put in your key card and look up the nuke codes for your silo!

---
I'm using this build. 
---
Heavy guns: ultacite prime gatling laser and lmg
---
Automatic rifles: 10mm smg
---
Pistols: wester revolver
---
I switch my heavy  gunner cards with shotgun perks sometimes. And the concentrated fire for the skeet shooter perk. When i feel using a shotgun 
---
Armor is Vanguard SS armor 2 or 3 pieces have RR
---
Its a pretty good tank build. I can survive in nuke zones  for a while without PA. And the lvl 100 enemies arent that much of a challenge
---
Thanks for the advice! :)
---
If you weren‚Äôt trying to be mean, you should try harder.
---
The ponytail guy is from the Canadian version of the show, isn't he?

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs easier but it‚Äôs certainly more entertaining for a wasteland theme game. I miss the days when I could just go to the forest area and pick up anything i need and completely ignore the few level 1 enemies pew pew at me, they felt like staff in a theme park lol.
---
Why is this place so popular? 
---
There's always mutiple people with camps near by and lots of people want to meet there to trade.
---
Sounds good!
---
Sounds good. Looking forward to it!
---
That's what I do.  Why bother putting on PA/stealth armor when you can just sip a diluted or 2 and run in?
---
You need a similar catchy name that is slightly different. Perhaps John W. Likes Booth... hmm, that actually sounds kinda creepy. Nevermind. üòÜ
---
1 rank of each is enough if you want to invest it into something else.
---
Yes this too. Thanks for catching some of the things I forgot
---
I joined a team the other day to try and do one. The mother fucker completed the last mission before you can launch nukes, by default completing it for me. Thanks guy, it‚Äôs not like I wanted to actually see that mission or even know how to launch them.
---
Will do! And is there a way to reset perks/builds later on?
---
Hey, depending on your play schedule I could show you the ropes tomorrow
---
If you can 1 shot most mobs without them why even have them equiped.
---
Haha, that's a good method. I've seen someone else drop a bag with some toxic goo and toilet paper on someone's bed.
---
Thanks! :)
---
There is a Canadian version?  What channel? I need that in my life
---
They should let you queue for events the same way you do for WoW dungeons.
---
If you're on PS4, I have one you can have.
---
Well said haha. Pretty cool how so much of the F76 community stayed with it.
---
I had the same problem. Kept my Bloodied  without the tri barrel and the vampire version with. I would pray and spray and heal. Started noticing that the vampire with barrel would do way more dmg than the bloodied, and I would use less ammo. In one quick burst everything dies. So I think the tri barrel is a good improvement. Also if accuracy really matters to you, get stabilizer under Intelligence, changed my whole game. Only downside, you need PA. Hope I worded that correctly English is not my first language.
---
If you want to be heavy guns, and commando, then you‚Äôll need to max out strength and perception. 
---
All the heavy gun damage perks are under strength. And all the commando damage perks are perception. So if you plan on having all of the perk cards, you will need 15 on both. You don‚Äôt HAVE to.  But it would be smart to do it. 
---
Of course putting 30 points in two stats means that you‚Äôll have less points to put into the other stats. But you‚Äôll have to toy around with that idea. Click right here https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks and it will take you to a site where you can play around with your skill points. Along with the perk cards available. In case you‚Äôre a new player it also shows you ALL the perk cards there are for each stat. So you can see which ones you‚Äôll need,etc.
---
It's the people who dont stay on the objectives that kill me.
---
They just go around killing enemies..... but of they stayed on the objective they would get more kills, so it's super unnecessary.
---
Are they considered containers so you have to hit so many before the reset?
---
Since they have changed how those nodes work few months back, i'm not 100% sure on this. But i'm under the assumption that the lucky hole mines nodes are now in the same category as common world objects / junk. Meaning that you need to pick up xxx amount of stuff for them to respawn. I have to farm lead so rarely now that i really can't say for sure.
---
Yeah, I knocked a point off my damage to flesh out ground pounder. Figured a bit less reload made more sense.
---
I was using 3 rank1 but today I even doubting if it worth equip rank1 for merely lesa than 10 more damage
---
Have a great day my friend.
---
Right... slowing it... preventing the bar from dropping quickly enough to fail the event. No one is saying you can win the event by just doing drums and spits. 
---
I remember the first few events this year, failing the first two because no one was on them. We were just collecting... them we learned it helps if the bar is slowed... giving you enough time to collect üòÇ
---
Couldn't agree more amigo.  I love the game and have 1200+ hours but it is what it is and nothing more.
---
Not really after lvl 50 you can move you perk points around, but it is only one per level.
---
If only the bash hitbox wasn't so bad, lol!
---
I love this game too much. My VATS finger is actually hurting.
---
Yea it should be like that and maybe a bit longer
---
I always feel like, somebody‚Äôs watching meee....
---
I decided that Speed Demon might be causing most of my lock ups, glitches, etc. We‚Äôll see.
---
If you join a server and someone is in your spot you can stay on that server but DON'T place down another camp. If you dont place another camp when you leave that server and join another where your space is avalible it will place your camp again.
---
plasma core are a reward (if used during the ops) at the end of the ops
---
I had come across a bunch of flux one day and now I have 90 Ultracite Plasma Cores just sitting in my stash
---
Ah okay. Well that's something at least. I'm always scared of screwing up builds, or changing playstyles mid-way.
---
That is correct. However if you place your camp on the new server, that is your new location.
---
Does it work with Chinese Stealth Armor?
---
You must be pretty weak if people giving radaway to noobs is enough to threaten your superiority.  My condolences.
---
Thanks! Feel free to add me. I'd rather explore it on my own first though. I love being a newb in a big new game and figure things out.
---
Chally and Grahm's cooking show. Starring fire, wood and critter bits.
---
This is why i keep my cursed shovel lol
---
Yeah I noticed, went there hoping to find a leader of them to talk to but sadly no such person was there
---
Hmm sounds like a waste of time on people that don't deserve time.
---
See ya in the next fire fight!
---
Usually when someone joins a server and their spot is taken they come here to complain about it.
---
Thanks! Good to know :) This is a lifesaver when I'm just server hopping for vendors
---
I actually didnt even pay attention to your legendary effects. Thats a really nice gun! That is probably the best rolls you can get on an LMG. Mine is a B/10DWA/50DRWA.
---
This speaks to me. We non damage builds need some acknowledgement. Holler to initiate kn if you need a packing mule.
---
I've had that happen, though it's been a while. You can turn on pacifist mode, so that firing at someone won't flag you for PvP. There are a couple of loopholes, but it mostly works.
---
I've been having the same problem. I've a stash half full of lvl 1-5-10 armour and weapons that I literally cannot give away. I've begun messaging people, telling them it's stuff to help them, that I can't pvp them untill lvl5 and even if I could, what would a lvl 10 have that I could possibly need?
---
But no. Some people just won't be helped
---
Get a pc. I did that uranium thing and killed 100's of glowing ones and i still got over 100fps on max
---
People don‚Äôt understand the problem.
---
F76 heavily encourages team play through xp bonuses that grow the longer you‚Äôre together. Ready checks imply they actually want to do the DO, but what about after they‚Äôve done it? Asking them to split up isn‚Äôt going to work even if they‚Äôre just strangers who hooked up for the DO, because after the DO is successfully done, they‚Äôre staying together because of the bonus.
---
If anything, the DO team should be automatically converted to a casual team after a DO completion, or time out entirely into a casual team if they don‚Äôt ever enter a DO. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being the only one actually doing the DO.
---
I did find him once. He started following me and we fought one mob in the area. I then had to fast travel and he didn't come along for the ride. And that was the end of that friendship.
---
Kevduit also has some builds on his website.
---
In the central part of the Mire near the Maw. Look it up
---
It‚Äôs a shame that people don‚Äôt join in on the higher level end game events. Some servers you‚Äôll get almost everyone joining in but it‚Äôs seems more frequently people won‚Äôt. 
---
I am lucky my buddy and I can duo any of the high level events so we don‚Äôt really even wait for people to show up anymore. It‚Äôs their loss if they don‚Äôt want to join a public event.
---
Yeah it does
---
Im up at pretty late/random hours hmu on ps4 Tekilla53233
---
Yup if you use it to kill the last mini-boss.
---
No its fine Imo.  I duo'ed with a level 17, they stayed with me the entire time and hid behind poles and walls, but still stayed in the capture zone each time.
---
So long as you contribute by staying in the zones (and if you want to be MVP keep a melee weapon on you for resilient mutation) I would consider you 1000% more essential then the teams I join with level 200+ that don't even join the op until its almost done for free loot/don't even join at all.
---
I felt really guilty last night because I was doing a daily op and we had a full team of 4. We did an OP and I went to repair my gear and work on finishing up my daily level up and then only after I realized that I was still in a daily ops team. 
---
Hopefully I don't do that again
---
For PC specs, what is "mid tier"? 2019-2020 mid tier should run it fantastic at 1080 and decent at 1440.
---
Perspective: my pc is mid tier from 2015. I5 4790k (IIRC), 8gb ram, gtx 970. I get 30-45 fps at 1440 with medium-high settings in most areas but some situations bogs it down due to their optimization (certain scenarios are hard on all cards I believe)
---
Well what kind of weapons would you like to use and I can send you a guide to give you an idea how to go about it.
---
It takes time to get team bonds
---
You don't have to be scared. Every mistake you make can be corrected. It just takes some time.
---
Well, if you prefer Steam, you prefer Steam.  But free (essentially...I got into Game Pass for $1 for the Out Worlds release and have played about a half dozen AAA games and a dozen indy games on it) has its own charm, especially for games you aren't sure you will like.
---
Having it switch the team after the Op is the correct answer.  Don't lose the bond you have, and players that want to do an Op wont join a team set as casual.
---
+1
---
Oh, now that would be cool, too! Dang....
---
Is Bethesda headquarters so dirty?
---
I think you missed my point, being my critisism is aimed at the tone rather than the gameplay. Just mean something more in line with the past games rather than Fortnite, Minecraft etc
---
I'm an idiot. Thank you sir
---
They now add such a low amount of damage that it depends on your weapon: if you have slow weapon (melee, gun...) or low base damage weapon they're not worth the space they take in your perk slots. As a melee, I've removed every one of them as the damage is now as shitty with than without.
---
Just can't shake these nightmares. Floating in space forever. Just... why?
---
Players always can find broken builds. Ignore that. I was in the lobby with a player who have broken build that makes each bullet from gauss minigun make 200+ damage and enormous fire rate.
---
2 glowing radroaches inside WS, golf clubhouse, usually at least 3 glowing mole miners outside Blackwater.  The L100 ghoul inside one of the cottages is glowing.  IIRC, the the boss wolves at the leader of the pack are glowing.  The random critter near the WS gazebo is often glowing.
---
Some the mrelucks guarding the toxic goo barrels are glowing.
---
And of course, Radiation rumble and UF.
---
Actually cheating (using mouse and keyboard if the game doesn‚Äôt allow it) and full on aimbot and other similar hacks are possible on PS4 if just takes a of work and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a common misconception that people can‚Äôt hack on console you just have to do something similar to jail breaking and iPhone to be able to do it
---
No I was just going through west tek killing the super mutants.  I did some more testing and it seems like the instigating effect works a minority of the time.  I was talking with some friends and one of them said there was some sort of sneak damage cap but I cant confirm this at all.  Something I think might be happening is that the instigating effect only gives you double damage of the base damage of the weapon.  So if I was doing 260 damage but the base was 60 damage, instead of doing 520 damage on the first shot it would do 320.  I have not done enough testing to confirm this though.  Thanks for the reply sorry for being late
---
No, I agree with the poster, that‚Äôs a long way of saying we should have changed the team goal. Do what you want but yes, people do have a right to be upset and will get upset if you mislead them that what you want to do is daily ops.  And that is your fault for not changing team goal. No one is saying you shouldn‚Äôt do what you want. They‚Äôre saying you should be mindful and let others know what the team is doing so they know if they should join.
---
Now what makes you think I gave you the award üëÄ
---
Joined a casual group the other day, we spent about an hour arguing the better cartoon between Ren &amp; Stimpy OR Beavis &amp; Butthead....  I say Beavis and Butthead becuase if spun off King Of The Hill
---
I dont understand the idea of staying past the 1st run. I join a team or make one...run it ...get elder...drop group.  Do other people do more then 1 ops even if they get the elder completion?
---
Strange, it always works for me as I never carry a shovel and its always spawns for me. If your on PC you can have my cursed one for free if you want.
---
Yeah it is frustrating.  Especially because the damage numbers shown when you hit an enemy is not always to be trusted.  Overall if they fix these issues the patch has been good for the game but the biggest problem is that the way damage is done is less transparent and is harder to troubleshoot.  Thanks for the reply
---
Is 1v1 match possible with one ball?
---
They work like items, you need to go and loot other world items
---
Batteries included works for them, they count as energy ammo
---
Brave of you to post this here, given the communities stance on PvP.
---
If you want a viable PvP build you basically need to min/max your character, no room for weight reduction or quality of life perks.
---
You can get by with a non optimized build/gear against most players in a workshop (most players go for quality of life and weight reduction perks) but in the incredibly rare event you come across someone built for PvP you will not stand a chance if you are not built/geared in a similar manner.
---
I don't think bloodied has been good for PvP in a long time. Most people seem to generally run with full health builds for PvP because the damage cap removed the benefits of bloodied damage.
---
You will want to go commando build, hitting your opponent as fast as possible is key when there is a damage cap. 
---
Don't use power armour.
---
Really effing cool man. When I saw the light peaking through the topI was like what the eff. I try to make stuff like this sometimes but it's quite hard and I end up just saying eff it.
---
In a team you get the x2 x3 x4 boost so the time is much shorter (if you all stay near the boosters)
---
Sentry bots can be killed easily by targeting the cores on its back. Also use stealth + vats if you are finding it hard to hit them.
---
I gotchu with the greens. I‚Äôm the green man!
---
Yea but that only when you have it in your inventory not your stash box right? I have that perk since I am a 100% power armour and carry on avg 6 fusion cores all the time
---
Mines and grenades or a good stealth build
---
What is Thra?
---
How does that increase the chances? I‚Äôve done elder and the past 3 days I‚Äôve gotten no plans
---
The primal cuts near crater also has glowing snallygasters in wave 3, most of the time.
---
Level 31. No chance I'm not going to be able ro finish it. Legendary Run was about 10 weeks, I believe, stacked witg plenty of double SCORE events. So if you're anywhere from 20-30, you should be able to finish it if you play actively. Below that, you may have to grind a tiny bit more, but it's still too early to be worrying about it.
---
But penta looks cooler
---
On the other end of this, don't kick a guy from a casual team because everyone but him felt like doing daily ops.
---
Gameplay mechanic? I don‚Äôt follow, how is something that is required to power the frame a gameplay mechanic when in lore it literally states that they need FC to be effective? Yeah it technically is, but it‚Äôs also part of lore, or am I misunderstanding?
---
Scratch my previous comment. 
---
I see a possible error in your summary:
---
- Food and drink buffs for xp and SPECIALs do not stack. You want the highest value i.e. Cranberry Relish (25% xp) and Brain Bombs (7.5 int) for Herbivore. Tasty squirrel stew (25% do) and Scorchedbeast brain (7.5 int) for Carnivore. There for canned meat stew has no value since it only offers maximum 12.5% for carnivores. All numbers are assuming the perk strange in numbers is equipped.
---
Something else I want to add on: 
---
- Full set Unyielding armor gives 15 int. Full set Unyielding armor with +1 int give 20 int total. That‚Äôs 40% xp buff.
---
- Mutation Herd Mentality gives +2.5 int with strange in numbers and playing with teammates.
---
- Shielded Flannel and jeans actually give the highest int (+3) but the vault jumpsuit gives more useful stats.
---
Thanks very much! It is man, don't know how many times I scrap and restart until a eventually get something going
---
It's satisfying walking into a room and filling it with ash piles with a good Flamer.
---
tshooters gear
---
Yep on your person. Batteries included works with fusion cores too. I got like 100 on my pa character and it really helps
---
It's actually more beneficial in terms of rare rewards to get Paladin first run and then elder the next so they may be doing that strategy
---
How‚Äôd you get the wastelanders add on for cheap on PS4? I keep waiting for it to go on sale!
---
I see your 189. That gives you three legendary perk slots. Probably not enough perk coins to level them up much. Also depends if your in PA or not which legendary cards to pick. But with ranked up legendary perk cards you can specialize in both. 
---
      
---
I‚Äôm a bloody non pa heavy. I use rifles a lot and with only a PER of 3 and it‚Äôs not terrible. I use mostly the LegendRy SPECIAL cards to boost my special and use more regular perk cards, which I find are generally more useful than legendary perks. I‚Äôm around level 410 tho. STR 15, PER 3 END 10 CHR 8 INT 5, AGI 14, LCK 15. I may be off on the AGI.
---
So just do the impossible and carry them all on you. I have something like 60k rounds of ammo on me at any time.
---
It will also overheat after a while giving you a chance to hit the cores while they are exposed.
---
Yea. Thats why i gotta get out my stash box....lol I need the lost weight lol
---
I have often picked up all the plans and legendary items that someone has just dropped as a drop/loot bag item and then go and put them in safer places like for the plans they go to the containers at the overseers camp at the wayward and legendary items go into blue suit cases at some train stations etc along woth all of my own un needed items so those intended players actually get a chance to have them. I've also bought bulk cheaper items from people to give away to newer players when i need to spend caps. Serums cool outfits mags etc.
---
Garbage?! Sweet sweet script savings.
---
just did it myself, still works post patch 22
---
I usally try and keep it around 6000. I only use a 50 cal
---
Wow this is great! I‚Äôve seen a lot of Soviet science fiction before and it looks amazing but never seen this one before!
---
Yes, there is no way levels &gt; 100 are only \~16K XP. Source: I am level \~325 and each level-up accumulates more than 2 SCORE "earn 10,000 XP" rewards.
---
PSA: we don't need any more PSAs about this.
---
I play on PC so I can't rubber band anything
---
I have yet to try that...I know ive seen people talk about it. And I had a post on here a day or 2 ago about it.
---
Dang, that's harsh
---
I‚Äôm on PC level 125 and have never revived an ally. People just bloody respawn. I dont even know what button I would have to press!
---
Got a bit of age on it now and I play at 1440p but I would still call an OC'd and underwater 7700k and 1080 a PC.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't the bonus only applied to XP earned for just the Daily Op? If so then there is no point to remaining in the group if no one is doing a DO.
---
I actually misunderstood the intent in the update. I thought that no enemies would be above your level, not that all of them would be at your level.
---
Yes this would be amazing.  Any cosmetic item that weighs .10 can be stored in it.  This would make stash sorting so much easier.  They could even add in a little preview where we could cycle outfits before committing to see how Headgear A looks with Outfit C, or Headgear F looks with Outfit B, etc.
---
If it had unlimited weight (but again only .10 cosmetics) it wouldn't save that much stash and could be set to only hold 1 of each item so its not abused.  This wouldn't be much of a problem for the whole fallout 1st infinite junk storage, as One 14lb flamer is the same as 140 outfits/headgear.
---
Even if it was shared storage, at the very least its a great way to sort.
---
Be glad that its a sentry bot and not an asaultron
---
I managed to do a few last night, got some decent legendaries every run
---
If everyone‚Äôs collecting you finish the event in under a minute. Your a waste being on the drum or a spit. Clean up slows the bar. Kill critters. Collect greens. The drums and spits are a waste after the initial start up. It‚Äôs not an argument it‚Äôs facts. Afk at the event banging a drum doesn‚Äôt help
---
Ooh and you're getting it right before Halloween stuff starts... this will be a fun next month for you. Exciting!! I don't do much aside from decorating my house and doing random stuff by myself, but feel free to add me if you want/need more friends... same name as on here! I always try to have free Halloween Candy in my vending machine... trick or treat! üéÉ
---
Have fun!!
---
Well, I feel your pain. I try to craft a junkies, faster fire rate gauss minigun... and I alteady crafted 70ish, wothout luck, and I have like 80k 2mm in my pocket (with batteries inclueded perk card)...
---
My PC is a Ryzen 7 2700, gtx 1660ti, 16gb ram. Runs fo76 great on high settings @ 1080p. It may be slightly more optimized than fo4 but I don't have any issues running fo4 on this pc either.
---
If you're weary check out the game pass on the xbox app via windows store. Can try out the game for $1 as it's included in the game pass.
---
Take cover until it finishes its initial barrage. Then you have a few seconds to gets some shots in. If you can, target the fusion core on its back. This is way easier with VATS and the concentrated fire perk. This will immediately kill it if you hit it. You should be able to hear it winding up to start attacking again. Take cover again until the barrage is over. Rinse and repeat.
---
Maybe if we wish hard enough Bethesda will hear
---
I tried it yesterday. Got the gutter plan the first run and the liquid courage recipe the 2nd.
---
This game needs a group chat. This is the biggest issue. Most dont use micro. You cant communicate if you are not standing next to your team mate...
---
I don‚Äôt even know what a build is. I just mainly use .45 ammo and grenades
---
The thing most people don‚Äôt understand is that very few who have actually played F76 think it‚Äôs a bad game, it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a lot of fun. People get frustrated because of how much better the game could be and the potential it has to be great with the right bug fixes and additional features. All in all though it‚Äôs still a good game as is and you‚Äôll definitely get your money‚Äôs worth out of it.
---
Those are easy, they may be ammo sponges but they don‚Äôt one shot.
---
This just isn't true. Fallout 76 is optimized better than Fallout 4 and runs even smoother on my pc than 4 does.
---
Did you still had budget to decorate? Nice job man
---
I may have not wrote it the best, but when you place the new ally it auto scraps the old one, and resets any bugs. The problem was the Future Tech Camp skin in the end, I remove it and now the ally is back to normal
---
Pacifist on. Do what u want troll boy.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm gonna restock and run though the dungeon again
---
We‚Äôre all getting screwed by Bethesda. So far I‚Äôve only got a few items, mainly Caged Bulb plans, doing Elder on two characters daily. The 80% chance to get rare rewards is really 80% chance to get NOTHING.
---
To be fair, the game does a crappy job of even hinting at what you should be doing. As a new player going in, critters are the most obvious option especially when there's a few other events with the same cycle of kill mobs, get items, put in the thing.
---
Thanks! I usually use SMGs or sniper rifles in F3/F4. So I'm sure I'll have similar playstyles here. But I'll experiment a bit before I spend too many perks in one way.
---
Seriously tho! A friend commented that this game is just a simplified version of the previous fallout games and yet....
---
 I got three ppl I know irl to play with me and I spent a solid 2 weeks training them. And I'm still babysitting them lol. They told me it's overwhelming, that they needed time to understand the game before they understood why it was fun. 
---
Idk how to make the game newbie friendly without veterans helping them out. Tutorial island sounds like hell tbh.
---
Edit:: my friends/brother are all fallout fans who played older games.
---
Saying that people will "constantly engage you in pvp" is utterly ridiculous. I've played this game for months on end and the only time I ever got stuck in pvp was when took a workshop, got killed by a super high level with legacy weapons and stupidly went for revenge. My own fault.
---
PvP is basically a non-issue in 76 as long as you have pacifist mode on.
---
I recently started using the batteries included and I have right now 2k 2mm 50 ult plasma cores 12 regular ones 12 fusion cores and 7k fuel. It def helps a lot.
---
Sentry bots never one shot me though. I think they are pretty weak in the game. Assaultrons, especially the dominators using stealth can be tricky
---
After a while i learned to shoot the legs. Untill they are crippled
---
Yeah, but not as much as i'd have liked. Went a bit crazy with the structure lol left myself short. Thank you
---
Indubitably
---
Let me tell you why i heavely disagree with your opinion:
---
1. Melee attacks from enemies can hit you and stagger you while you're 4-5 meters away
---
2. Melee from the player attacks are inconsistent and rarely stagger the enemy, 1 attack out 10 (being optimistic here) doesn't register, it happens that 3 attack in a row doesn't register
---
3. Melee has been nerfed to oblivion compared to some ranged builds
---
4. If i use an unoptimized 50 cal build (bloodied only) i take out enemies faster and from a safe spot without being bothered by melee attacks and staggers (might be why stealth commando vats builds complained why the game was too easy and we got this nerf), now imagine pre patch where people were using optimized vats builds dealing more damage than melee at safe distance (by the way they still do post patch)
---
Now the blocking in this game is supposed to counter staggers and melee damage only letting you take radiation, poison and other lingering effect in general but the biggest flaw is that it doesn't work at all and even on mobs it's supposed yo work on the blocking action is limited by 1 second block which is beyond moronic because what often happens is you block and they stand in front of you waiting for you to stop blocking then hit you with physical damage and staggers. Only blocking on SBQ and earle during colossal problem works fine but not on the wendigos.
---
Since i don't think they will bother fixing these issues i believe a no stagger perk in strenght is the best option
---
Gotcha! Thank you for clarifying! :D
---
I just make my 12 year old run my dailys.  Trying to teach him theres more to life than fortnight ;)
---
Need to loot 180 world objects to reset.
---
I actually just took bloody mess out and am using other perks worth it being bloody mess maxed out is worthless now. I might as well keep all commando perks in tho
---
\] forever near maxed cap limit
---
   Once I got to that point, I started buying mutation recipes.  and recovering the 17k each recpie costs takes a few days.  Selling serums back to thE bots is an easy way to hit the daily cap limit (if you fall short from selling other stuff)
---
Beyond that, I buy ammo and plans I don‚Äôt already have, sometimes at over inflated prices, just to bring my cap balance down. And/or at a bot, don‚Äôt bother with hard bargain.  Helps whittle down the caps
---
So SMGs and rifles fall into a perception tree so you can use both with just swapping perks. I'll dm you a build to help you.
---
Agreed almost 100%. Only thing: If the Tesla rifle is non-auto, Rifleman does apply. Still wouldn't run with it unless often using the Tesla. Depending on where running, I'd probably throw in Glow Sight instead.
---
What challenge is that ? You better craft pistols
---
Is there a plan for the brick wall? What a great looking camp.
---
Scrap gun
---
The photo gallery would be fun
---
Yea i made 22 medics in a row ....and was like wtf is going on so I shut down my xbox and cleared the game cache thinking I can't possibly have that bad of a rng to get that...that many times...lol I got better last night got a 2 shot ffr
---
Excellent explanation. Thank you. :)
---
I didn't say everyone will constantly pvp you. I said you'll run into some that will be cool and help and you'll run into some that are dbags that will do that. Also that's why I said pacifist will be your best friend. Learn how to read ü§∑
---
You're right. I just don't know anyone who regularly uses a Tesla that won't go shotgun lobber or auto since by comparison the one shot is so weak.
---
Craft min level gun, scrap- repeat
---
Heya, got it from a local Dutch store. I'll have it by mail tomorrow.  So probably won't be helpful for you. I think Wastelanders was on sale on PSN some weeks ago though. Maybe keep an eye on that?
---
More pics? Really like this.
---
Ok thank
---
I use both. I dont use PA though.

For me, "hunters" is that one I always craft.
---
Congrats for that TS FFR :)

Oooh. Sounds good! We don't celebrate Halloween in the EU. So at least I'll get to experience it in some way haha.

Whenever myself and/or the team I'm in complete the daily OP. I change the public team goal over to casual. It doesn't change automatically, but it's easy to change as long as your the team leader and you keep the experience bonus. Just click your name in the social menu and you will see the option.
---
Incorrect
---
The lmg doesnt need a spin up
---
Might have good luck finding pistols on scorched around Morgantown or just anywhere scorched are found. Raiders and blood eagles sometimes carry pistols as well.
---
My wife and I would love to find a group.
---
Wastelanders is a free mandatory update. Are you thinking about the raiders vs settlers cosmetic package? A friend of mine got those two confused too.
---
Mate stimpy is king!
---
Finally after 7 days in a row of no rare rewards. I got the gutter and cage lights last night. I am just doing it till I get the solar chargers and war glaive and then im done lol
---
I mean I agree with you, however whenever I join DOTs we run it a few times then take a break. Ya know do some repairs maybe run an event or two then hop back into it.
---
Good to know :)
---
Nope. Your more valuable actually participating. The bar doesn‚Äôt decrease that fast especially if u clean up the site. Should be able to kick people on drums and spits from the event. Waste of space
---
Uranium fever not so much anymore unless you only need a few. I mostly see dredgers and skullcrusher variants now. But definitely radiation rumble
---
If you check out this site it‚Äôs highlighted on the map with the exact location üëç
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_lookout
---
Well you have all the weapons cards :P
---
I missed the 8 minute target yesterday because someone didn't join the ops until it was almost over.
---
Punching robots, eating eyebombs, pounding stims, but no. 8 minutes and 4 seconds because we had a straggler.
---
It's an action-packed event, but Armor Ace and the Power Patrol would weep if they knew how much people are phoning it in.
---
FYI, bash the fucking things if you have a ranged build. I get tired of leaving the uplink radius to clean up your mess. They literally have 1 HP left when they're glowing, just smack them and they'll die.
---
My rifleman build is total fucking garbage now. I have no idea where to go from here. I‚Äôve got a ton of weapons, I think summer even good, I just don‚Äôt know much more than rifles..
---
Why wouldn't you just carry them on you if you have the perk on? I have both Batteries Included and Bandolier and carry at least 15k each for my .50 Cal and my Guass Minigun.
---
Hmm didn‚Äôt give you nothing. So that means it did give you something?üôÉ
---
Id like a vamps...but im gonna take  a rest and allow my luck to build for a few weeks lol my rng is junk in this game.
---
Nope. Too many people doing the same thing results in waste. I can‚Äôt pick up critter bits if two other people show up and pick them up first. What good am I then?
---
Yes that‚Äôs correct but Inspirational still applies to being on that team, and not everyone cares/is aware of the benefits of the additional Intelligence from switching the team to Casual.
---
I have trouble keeping track of what's great and what's not so I'm sure I put some insane deals on my vendors. Hell I've been around since beta and I just started experimenting with a two shot plasma gatling and vampire combat shotgun. I'm looking at leaving the bloodied lifestyle behind.
---
Clean up. Put out fires. Grab greens
---
Not sure, it said F76 and Wastelanders on the box. So I figured it was the most recent thing to get xD
---
And wait until the team is bonded before going in.
---
My 2 caps worth
---
Its fun to switch between weapon types, it keeps the ammo levels in balance.  Why wasting  308 rounds on scorched wastelanders or supermutant skirmishers if u can use 10mm ammo on them.
---
I go every day and farm lucky hole mine and I have had no issue getting lead. But I heard somewhere that the game tracks the last 150 items you have looted and someone else on this post commented 180, so that may be your issue
---
Interesting. So how do you get it? Dirty needles or sex?
---
That and not seeing what Power Armor you have on your frame. Having to place it down/rename it just to see which set it is.
---
Hey I‚Äôm happy with anyone joining in as long as they:
---
A) Sit on the capture point
---
B) Draw Ads away from me
---
C) Don‚Äôt have an open mic
---
Otherwise the Daily Ops are pretty easily done solo.
---
This.  My two main heavies are a vampire 50 (Mrgph) and a vampire gatling plasma (Fascnacht).
---
Got an Explosive (exterminator) 50 from Grahm last might, but really havent had the chance to test it out.  
---
I know the expl will be nice, but the health regen from the vampire is going to be tough to beat. :)
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant. The raiders and settlers thing.
---
I had garbage mini guns...so i just put it on display and forgot about it. Out a sight out a mind lol...ot will be gone in a few days...got lucky last night and rolled a 2shot ffr....so 14k rounds will be eaten very quickly
---
Yeah I'm overall very pleased with Bethesda products. I usually get them below 30 euro's. And that's totally worth the 100ths of hours I get out of it. The microtransactions don't seem to be that bad in F76 either. I had a lot of FOMO in ESO, and I spent way too much on it. I doubt it'll be the case here.
---
From now on, just because of you, I‚Äôm only going to do drums/spit. When they‚Äôre full, I‚Äôll just watch everyone or AFK ü•∞üòò
---
Phil Spencer already said Starfield will be Xbox and PC exclusive. All others will be case by case. I would not be so confident.

---
Something like maybe a pipe pistol and super duper..perhaps that pipe pistol perk will help use less mats..not to sure on the last part
---
Get Concentrated Fire, get behind it, target the core, and shoot. Takes three hits maybe.
---
Get the Batteries included perk.  
---
Drops core weight significantly.  IIRC, maxed, it drops both fusion And plasma cores to 0.3
---
They could simply want to keep charisma perks active, but don't care enough about the group bonuses to switch groups.
---
Drives me nuts. I hate radtoad eggs. Their real danger isn't that they explode it's that they jam up my vats.
---
Very fair point.
---
I know some of the time as team leader I kinda get distracted and forget to disband the team when I'm done with ops for the time but on the other hand I've had people join my team and not do ops at all or join the team just to idle at ops hoping I'll carry their ass the entire time while they sit there and be a lazy sack of shit.
---
If you have no pictures at all it will show random locations as your loading screen
---
That definitely fits right in...awsome job for real...I need to step my build game up alot
---
I was gonna do that but needed some other perk and Had extra stash space
---
Kovac-Muldoon certainly is. We could get all Enclave programming, all the time.
---
Imma be honest, I totally forgot the Atlas events were still a thing
---
To add to this, Workshop areas are PvP areas. That mean if you take one at any point a player can come and contest it which immediately starts PvP. If that does happen and a player kills you all you will drop is items considered junk on your person and a few caps. If you are not carrying junk it will just be caps but like I said its not much so death does not mean a lot.
---
Also do not pick player created locks, you will become wanted because you stole. While wanted any player can come and kill you for a few caps.
---
What is your luck at? I didnt think you special stat luck mattered when it came to rewards, but after playing with a chick that had her stat at 15 I kind of do. The day before yesterday she hot the symptomatic, and yesterday day she got the spec ips suit and mask at the same time. I didnt even know you could earn more than one rare reward at a time.
---
Daily Op, no. Please join. Stick to the beacons and hide / stay alive.
---
Earl (ACP) yes. Stay away. You‚Äôre uselessly taking up space.
---
if i‚Äôm not afk on a drum/spit i‚Äôm gathering the greens
---
This. I was skeptical until I tried it. I now make sure I'm turning or drumming for the two minutes before it starts.
---
If im team leader,  I'll change the team to casual when I'm done.
---
I experienced the same things. I am now waiting to see what new weapons the BOS brings. Maybe we get to see that before Xmas.
---
I would say I did notice a difference with SS in general, but especially because of the Rads rest.  
---
Also, Lunchboxes? Who does need an xp boost?
---
Little jealous right now.
---
Correct but the weapons he has do!
---
Mini gun and gattling laser!
---
Hmm- I guess you could check the atomic shop to see if the cosmetic package was included in your purchase!
---
But yeah- Wastelanders with the npcs, raider/settlers questline is all free! 
---
The raiders vs settlers bundle is just cosmetics! (And yeh still $30 on the Playstation store)
---
Im a rifleman still just to save ammo so who am I to talk :P If you have fun thats all that matters!
---
Builds are still important. I would still rather use 2 bullets per kill than 8.
---
Unarmed is for literally fist fighting, or more commonly the gauntlets (deathclaw, moleminer, etc) and powerfists which are considered unarmed.
---
Butressed is the one you want for resistances since its the best, otherwise, I go with deep pockets on everything but torso. If no jetpack, go for dense mod, it is like having 3 points in fireproof.
---
What system? Im happy to be your guide.
---
I'm still too scared to do anything like NW üò¢ like, the FIRST thing I did was put on pacifist ü§£ I'm very non-confrontational as a gamer!
---
I'm hoping either a roper m72 Gauss rifle or maybe some Service Rifles/R91 rifles that aren't just skins.
---
I read the comment just fine "SOME will be dicks but pacifist mode will be your best friend" 
---
Seems like you just skimmed through without actually paying attention and went Karen.
---
&gt;By no means is this build meant to harass other players
---
&gt; stealing from players purifiers and resource machines at their bases. Hacking player computers. Killing players
---
I pick up every single plushie I see because I want to collect them and put them on display. Then I promptly scrap them when I get home and I'm like, "Finally I can dump all this crap!"
---
We do the same
---
Lol hope everyone on your event does the same and u fail every event then x
---
Sacrificial Blade has a plan.. Rare drop (0.19%) from forest events/dailies. I got it myself.
---
As far as i know (or can think of) only scout armor mods can't be found as plans.
---

---
EDIT: forgot about power armor lamps, they don't have plans if i remember correctly, except for X-01.
---
I recently got my T-65 set completed and I hate it because all my cool NW paint jobs don't work on it, just the stupid season 1 paints. I hardly ever need to repair my SS armor though and the SS under armor is by far the best option. The ArmCo machine produced more .45 rounds than I ever used prior to daily ops ammo farming. Now I use it to produce 308 rounds to sell.
---
Luck doesn't affect shit in this game, except weapons durability when you find them and critical frequency.
---
Couatious  ..would you ever consider modding a ultracite ex laser I have?or maybe point me in the direction on how to get the plan to craft and scrap.never seen a ultracite laser plan anywhere. Really want to try diffrent barrels on it to see what would work the best
---
I was literally just editing my post because yeah, I did skim and I was wrong but nah go off, be a dickhead.
---
Yes I checked everything plus I don't run any mutations
---
Too be fair if you're an herbivore that turbo-fert stuff saves your ass if you're not relying on Survival Shortcut(obviously that will be null and void when they finally remove the negatives of not eating, but at the time I was just like you and didn't see how good it was.
---
I used to make like 20 Cranberry Relishes with two gourds regrowing in my camp alone, imagine how many I could make if I had a lot of gourds growing at once. The biggest drawback is that they are heavy(1 lb each without Ordinance Express) and somewhat slow to collect unless you don't mind waiting, crafting is also possible but I take my time so I don't waste resources.
---
Strange because i never have fps problems. I read also tesla rifle problems but i can arc the hell out of it and have 144fps on my 1440p monitor. I have an 9700k and a evga 1080 hybrid. If my frames would tank i would get an 3080 but that seems impossible and useless for my needs
---
Well all the  X, Expert X and Master X weapon perks have always be additive so nothing changed on that end. What changed was bloody mess, nerd rage, tenderizer, adrenaline, adrenal mutation, and so on.   
---
I was always in the 1 star of each for 30% instead of 9 for 60% and rode off the multipliers to make up the difference since one shotting min/max and one shotting at suboptimal was a thing.    
---
To be honest I don't even notice when I forget to equip my bloody mess, adrenaline, and tenderizer after doing mass shopping, ammo crafting ,and cooking.   
---
Overall all it seems the normalization of damage has had minimal impact and I have been shifting to weird QoL crap I would not take otherwise. For me what hurts the most is all the luck covering my mutations and serendipity so it limits some of the "fun" perk stacking.
---
Man so cool that you can  reiterate what the OP just said to me. Amazing. That took skill.
---
Well it's a new day hopefully that works
---
Erased comment..I might of been out of line a tad.
---
We run a team of 3 and always welcome a 4th... but we also finish them in around 6 mins each time and then switch to our lower levels and do it again. What drives me crazy is when someone joins and plays around in there which slows our time down. üòí
---
At least you could get 2 water wells for the same price
---
üëç
---
Oh no! Well... Samhain, then? üòâ
---
And what is the quote I love so much... "Every day is Halloween, if Halloween is in your heart", so regardless, you can still celebrate at my camp, for I am always in the Halloween spirit over there! And the best part is Fallout is basically a Halloween game, since the bombs went off on the 23rd of October... my favorite aspect across all of the games üëåüèª
---
&gt; but they don‚Äôt one shot.
---
...neither do sentry bots.
---
If you're getting "one-shot" by a sentry bot, then you must have either terrible gear (armor, specifically) or a terrible perk loadout, or both.
---
Yeah, it was weird, but no problem.
---
It doesn't always change it on the menu for everyone else just a heads up, I've been doing it and its delayed someone joined and asked why we were an events team doing the op, but i had switched it back after the bbq
---
3 star is the max. And no there's nothing you can do. It's all rng
---
Well the real question is how are your prices. I go by some camps and they are selling SQB plans for several thousand caps and other "not that rare" gear for crazy prices and that stuff just isnt going to sell. I wouldn't even try to sell meat week stuff right now. And weapons and armor are the worst. I can understand AAE, BE, and VE selling for alot (unless it's some junk weapon) but if it's a legendary that no one us really going to use then you are basically just selling them for script and they aren't worth thousands of caps. Legendaries just aren't rare anymore so they dont sell well unless they are cheap which is better than just throwing them away atleast.
---
It‚Äôs not so simple - after one wasteland you need to optimize even more.  If you remove damage cards how do their replacements help?  Rifleman or Commando for Tank Killer - likely worth it.  Might be more worthwhile having at least Concentrated Fire so you can grab headshots in VATS.  Covert Operative could be a must now for all sneak ranged builds.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of calculations involved to get to optimal now.  Also legendary perks can boost the perks you can have as well so maybe not remove but adding in more perks is better.
---
Hahaha if I made somekind of mistake I apologize, english is not my native lenguage, I'm argentinian.
---
&gt; 5 in demolition adds back the damage that was taken away in update
---
No it doesn't. I went from dealing ~2250 damage per headshot with my lever action to dealing ~400 damage per headshot on the same enemies. On high level high armor enemies I can deal as low as 160. I went from one shotting lvl 80 scorch beasts to struggling with the group of lvl 75 scorched that it spawns.
---
Edit: Also atm, vats and sneak don't mix. Been broken since the patch.
---
its the wasteland...
---
Hahaha :(
---
Well, I made my daughter (and her friends) build my camp! They're helping with the daily challenges too üòÇ
---
We won‚Äôt. The two people collecting will still be enough to do the event.
---
I checked and waited, but nothing showed up. I was so happy, and then so dissapointed lol
---
It does take skill to actually pay attention and read, Thank you. if you're having trouble I highly recommend the classic "hooked on phonics" Miss Karen.
---
It's just a Fallout thing at this point.
---
Thank you! it's just concrete walls with the cinder block wallpaper that was in the atom shop recently
---
You share my pain then üòî.
---
Thank you! Will post some more
---
Understood.  I‚Äôve played that game before :)
---
How about targeting some offscreen wendigo when Earle Williams is fucking standing next to me.
---
You and pretty much everyone else the moment it hit concrete and they realized all they were going to be able to get is a couple of stimpacks and a beer for hours of scavenging.
---
Go commando. It‚Äôs so much better it‚Äôs not even funny.
---
What weapon do you use? And what‚Äôs your build?
---
yeah, I'm sure he can magically get to lvl 75 and min max his build real quick to finish this quest! /s
---
I did, but the pie wasn't there. I'm sure it's a bug but it's a painful one lol
---
Everything should be meat piles , never heard a single person claim they couldn‚Äôt live without goo or ash piles.
---
I saw a capture of someone getting 3 caged lights in one run, so, it is range.
---
Your English is fine my friend. Quite honestly, lots of Americans say the same thing.   ...And we all know the English language is kind of ridiculous.
---
Yes , I use sound to find them after queen fights all the time
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. Heavy and auto rifles carry events. Put 3 riflemen into colossus and I doubt they can finish it, put 3 heavies in there and if they don't finish it I'll be surprised.
---
I should be able to mod that for you.  I am not currently online but will be later.  If you want you can send me an xbox message my GT is the same as my name here.  Just mention you are from reddit so I know who you are and we can meet up.
---
Alternatively if you want to go the route of crafting them and scrapping for mods you should be able to get the plan for the weapon from vendor bot Phoenix in Watoga I believe.
---
From my experience, the social menu displays the team correctly. It's just the HUD that's wrong. I've had this with team bonds too. It'll say "x1 bonus" even if I've gotten a x4 bonus and am getting way more XP.
---
Correct on the armor.
---
My Bloodied Limb Gauss shotgun is actually top tier, and since it's bugged out you have to use it in Vats for the perfect accuracy bug. Jumping helps it occur. I have all shotguns possible that are Bloodied or Quad, plus other rare ones, and the Gauss is still top. Third person for fast fire. Charging isn't required, just increases damage.
---
Gauss pistol is top in the pistol category, for semis that is. Still prefer BE Western as before the nerf it reached 900 damage without Adrenaline 5. Gauss pistol was around 1200.
---
Plasma Caster is inaccurate, except in Vats. Bloodied version was doing 1k without sneak and 2k in sneak. It allowed me to 3 shot scorch beasts. Broken Vats causes shots to not register sometimes, but that's with anything currently. 
---
Gauss Mini is crazy good, but not good enough to main. I'd rather use BE Gatling Gun or BE Mini. I use the Gauss for special occasions. 
---
Armco works perfectly with ammo converter. Make fast ammo like 5mm, then convert it to points for other ammo like 2mm.
---
The Turbofert works best with drink or food makers. My friend has the Grow plots, and I have the Turbofert with ability to craft. We made hundreds of Ballistic bock and High Voltage Hefe in an hour. Even better, you can use the grenades to make the plants grow to convert back into fertilizer for more grenades. Green Thumb is a must.

---
Yupp, all honesty it would be worth it if there was a small chance to get some rare limited items or something
---
I‚Äôve gotten a reward about 60% of the time
---
If I were you, I‚Äôd just start a second character and spec them into a different build type.
---
As heavy needs strength and commando needs perception, it would be pretty difficult to get both builds on one character to be viable for late game.
---
You could have:
---
Commando/rifleman
---
Or
---
Heavy/melee
---
On the same character, with enough levels to get all relevant cards.
---
That sucks. Daily ops even finishing in 6-7 min gets me 1 star, project paradise and the colossal mission also. At least the meat week legendary enemies drop 2 legendaries at a time
---
.50 Cal, Gauss minigun (expensive to use but its SUPER fun) 
---
I got lucky with the Purveyor a few weeks back with a Junkie's Explosive +1 Perception .50 cal, changed my build to a heavy gunner and it works like a charm
---
Don't  bother joining an existing daily ops team.  Start a brand new one of your own.  The whole server gets a notice, and  anyone who wants to run the op will join.
---
Many existing teams have already run the OP and achieved elder. Yes they should change it to something else, but they often don't and there's nothing you can do to change that.
---
So if you are looking to run an op, just start your own team.
---
I did this yesterday, and within seconds my team was full. We jumped straight into it and it was done within a few minutes.
---
Leveling is easy now, if you use xp boost perks.
---
I respect at level 100, took me ages to get the build sorted
---
3 is as high as you can get. Unfortunately it's all up to rng on the star and what weapon you get. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please. But I think doing the colossal problem event will award a 3 star weapon or armor.
---
yeah I wish they made some cartoons or silver shroud episodes or something that could loop.
---
Thank you kind sire
---
If I join a casual team and you change it to daily ops thats on you.
---
Thanks.was looking on f76 wiki how accurate is that?wiki on lk y shows 3 barrels I think I have 3 unlocked I really hope it's not accurate. I will pm you my gt.and maybe we can work something out.i did recently buy a bloodied minigun 10damage and 3rd wasnt very great I could pass or maybe I have something else you might like
---
Did you craft the SS with the perks that adds durability, (and) do you 200% repair it?
---
  My leg armor tends to take the most abuse (thanks to those pesky mole rats), but is no worse than my old heavy metal stuff. But the SS chest and arms have as good, if not better, durability that the metal armor I had.
---
interesting, ok thank you. There goes that niche market
---
Dumb question but what's RNG?
---
I just wish the event was a little bit longer. The average of four minutes between start and finish is sometimes a bit tight, especially when you lose track of time or have slow internet.
---
There are 2 display bugs atm.
---
One that shows too many points, that get reset to the actual number when you scrap a card and one where only the freshly scrapped cards are counted as points.
---
In both cases a relog solves this.
---
Xbox. Thanks for the offer.
---
That's not really viable as a method of killing many things quickly. It's slow, inefficient and expensive. I've found that my tesla rifle is actually quite strong after the patch.
---
You might not even need perk cards for shotgun as junkies is magical.
---
Only in vats though
---
Random Number Generator
---
I have never missed a day and have the patience to run just with with main, not the others. 
---
Results? Rewards every day. But I have been unlucky regarding other events and plans, like Caravan backpack, radioactive barrel, Bear Arm. 
---
It's range. Just keep playing. Eventually, extra-lucky people will sell those plans like it happens with the Fixer.
---
yeah trucks and aliens total history.
---
This is literally what Fallout 76 is for me, a American Pickers simulator. Most nights I spend a couple hours server hoping finding deals only to resell them at my base for profit.
---
In my main i use VE Gating primed for mobs (daily ops) VE .50 cal MG for some tough legendarys and INSFFR Gauss minigun primed for Earl/SBQ. (Im looking for a better Gauss)
---
With the Vampire weapons and the full vanguard armor, I never die fighting mobs.
---
I highly recommend get the Gatling prime cause in daily ops u can get a lot of ammo and u never worry about crafting ammo for that weapon.
---
And finally i had a Plasma Caster VATS oriented for low level (or weak) mobs. (Its good cause u can use the heavy perks in that weapon too)
---
The SPECIAL movie clips would be awesome all seven on a loop just playing on my tv would be worth the 2500 atoms they would charge lol
---
Literally every RPG I‚Äôve ever played, my first thing I focus on is my ability to carry as much shit as possible. Because I will inevitably become a hoarder.
---
I find The Mire to be such a beautiful location for a camp, can't tell you a exact spot but you can explore the place and see which location fits you the most. Also, there is a somekind of pond just south of Gramh's Meat Cook, which is where I got mine. Perfect for water purifiers and is a frequently visited area, which is good news for your vending machines.
---
no, it‚Äôs just 10%
---
The plasma caster is amazing.
---
Even now it one-two shots most mobs no problem. Uses alot less AP then The gatling gun, and seems to target everything fine. Only thing its weak against is Bosses because it has such a slow fire rate.
---
Sometimes I forget to change the event type, but we already ran it. I usually run with friends though. If I‚Äôm joining on randos I‚Äôve never had to hop more than once or twice to find people running it.
---
I'd say the gameplay fares  very similar to F4 so you shouldn't experience any issues. The biggest difference is getting used to VATS not slowing time down honestly lol
---
It's got bugs but it's nowhere near the buggy mess some loudmouths would make it seem. You get the usual texture glitches or ctd's every now and then that are basically staples of Bethesda games at this point. For me at least, 76 is very stable and I experience bugs and crashes very rarely.
---
The game seems to be optimized much better than F4. You can have half the server fighting one of the most powerful enemies in the game all using fatmans and the game will run fine, whereas in F4 shooting the fatman one time would make your frame dip like crazy. I play on max settings with an i7-7700 3.6ghz with a gtx1060 6gb and the game runs at 30-60fps depending on where I am and what's going on.
---
F76 is not your traditional MMO. There is no in game guild system. No text chat. No meetup hubs. No extensive HUD system. No RP vs PVP server options. Bethesda seems to really want 76 to be an MMO but I think they have a lot of work left to do before the game fan truly be considered one. The fanbase has done a good job of creating that MMO atmosphere for the game.
---
There are tons of build options. Power armor heavy guns, variants of melee, stealth snipers, gunslingers, bows/crossbows, the choice is yours. You can even base your build off camp building if you want. You can play a team medic. Or you can just do whatever you want. Plenty of freedom in 76.
---
As for fun, there is plenty in game to keep you interested and having a good time. I highly suggest making some friends because the game truly shines when you're enjoying it with other people.
---
Best of luck!
---
8 because class freak
---
That makes to much sense. Thank you
---
Not dumb at all. Random Number Generator. It's just randomly up to the game what you get.
---
IIRC, most commando perks are under PER, and most heavies are under STR, so if you can max out both, then add stabilized 3 under INT,  you should be able to do reasonably well with either weapon type.
---
If I tell you, then more people will find my special spot. And I can't have that.
---
68 I took a break for a while and forgot to cancel my f1st subscription so I had alott atoms
---
Didn‚Äôt even think of this! Awesome advice
---
Oh yea don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve come across some annoying pricks. But it definitely has been few and far between, so overall I‚Äôve been quite impressed.
---
They did this
---
I'm a dude but thanks. I'm also 33 so I understand the classic references you're probably hoping I don't get. Nice try though!
---
The gap has been closed around most things.
---
I would say my AAE Handmade is comparable to my Bloodied 50 handmade (both at low health), but I would still prefer to use the latter because the bonus Explosive Damage does nothing against bosses (whereas the +50% VATS crit does).  The health bar drain also feels more predictable with Bloodied.  With AAE, it's bouncing back and forth all the way up to the enemy's death, which makes it hard to assess when you can freely move on to the next enemy, versus when the current one ends up needing an extra shot.
---
Personally, Quad has become a popular prefix for me.  If things are generally going to take more than one shot to kill, it makes sense to have a lot more shots before you need to reload.  Not only that, but if you're already set up for frequent crits, you're still doing quite a bit of damage.
---
I've experienced this bug two times. First time I had to server hop, the second time I just entered in my PA and the noise went off.
---
2500 atoms and it‚Äôs yours ü§£
---
We‚Äôre still going then? Alright, let me get a cup of tea. 
---
It‚Äôs ironic that you mentioned straw men a while ago, as ‚Äòprove that PVP was popular at inception,‚Äô is a great example of one. I thought that maybe it was a point I inadvertently made, but re-read my posts and no, it‚Äôs not in there. 
---
It‚Äôs the *why* of that unpopularity that I‚Äôve been focussing on and, as I said, that is where we fundamentally disagree. It would be redundant for me to repeat the examples from my last post. 
---
The faeces analogy is one I‚Äôm struggling with a bit. It seems to suggest that PVP is inherently awful and would never work in Fallout 76. Therefore, me arguing that it wasn‚Äôt competently supplied or supported is irrelevant. 
---
Funnily enough, I probably do agree that PVP for this game was always doomed. Not because it‚Äôs a mode that‚Äôs incompatible with a Fallout player base, but because of Bethesda‚Äôs inexperience and scattershot vision for the game.
---
Same here xD
---
35 atm, solely based on xp gains.
---
Nope
---
Don't.
---
Trying to figure out how to leave a group, actually. The only way I've found is to leave the server entirely. Is there some "Click here to go solo" that I don't know about?
---
Yesterday I was bored so I stayed at the overseers camp and gave a bunch of plans, extra stuff and bobbleheads to two guys lvl 3 and lvl 5, and then came a lvl 40 and took everything except some plans, I had to contain the urge to kill him...  
---
I've taken a few plans that I didn't know, but taking basic survival stuff is a douche move
---
I'll definitely have to do colossal problem again and see if I just missed getting a 3 star. I might have not noticed
---
Finial word is a perfectly fine gun.
---
There my full health pa heavy gunner build. In case you wanted some inspiration. Ive been running this build for 250 odd levels now and love it
---
Ah ok, thank you for that. It's the first I've heard of it, I did consult Google first but nothing came up.
---
How the heck do you do that?
---
Kill 3 star enemies for a chance at 3 star drops, but again it‚Äôs not guaranteed
---
You got an explosive gatling plasma from Grahm? Those are legacy. ü§î
---
Welcome to the wasteland! If you‚Äôve got any questions just give any of us a shout. PSN is the same as my reddit username.

There's been a couple of times that I've started a Daily Ops team and had no (or few) takers. So I've gone about my other business, challenges, etc. If I am 1 1/2 minutes into Lode Bearing and you join my team and decide to start Daily Ops right away, I'm not dumping my event to come join immediately. There's no penalty for sitting in the "lobby" of DO (the first room you teleport into) so hang around and see if people show up. As a PC user without a mic, there's no easy way for me to communicate to others (on my team or otherwise) that I'll be a little bit delayed, so be patient.
---
That‚Äôs a long-winded way to say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know, it depends‚Äô.
---
Even the best pixels aren't worth losing sleep over...
---
Aw cool, but there‚Äôs no way to have random pictures and photo mode pictures? Cause I‚Äôd like to keep my photo mode pictures.
---
You still can. Just go to a silo
---
I could be totally wrong. I've only done it once and I can't remember if I did or not lol. I just recall seeing a post on here before talking about getting 3 stars from that event. I hope the RNG Gods bless you
---
I start and end my game day with dropping off radaways and stimpacks (sometimes disease cure) to newbies. They need it right now; they know how to use it; they will figure out the game play later.
---
TLDR - it depends what you‚Äôre replacing these perks with.  Just removing them for QOL perks is a bad idea.
---
For me it‚Äôs adding more perks to compensate for the damage nerfs - haven‚Äôt removed anything only added back more perks where I might have had some QOL ones previously.
---
Vats works fine , you just can‚Äôt combine it with any cards the buff vats ü§£
---
Hahah sounds good! And no Samhain either. We're quite boring over here. (The Netherlands) Do you play on PS4 as well?
---
XD
---
But the xp bonus only applies to xp from the ops, so if you're not running ops you're not getting the benefits of the bonus.
---
Cool. Will do. :)
---
Not in the ops! I was fighting level 40 blood eagles on my level 5!
---
I‚Äôm stealth 15-perk perception, rifle/meh fixer/handmade, all suppressed. I wear Chinese stealth 99% of the time, PA during sbq and colossal. Ideas?
---
I think slowly but surely they're getting that point as you can see with the far better loot pool in Daily Ops. 
---
Players will pretty much do whatever silly or even straight stupid or annoying thing they throw at us as long as you can get some rare cosmetics and limited availability plans or recipes.
---
Project paradise isn't too hard, but works best when you can get a team together and do some preparation and planning. Bethesda stripped away your ability to plan and prepare when they made it a random notification.
---
It boggles the mind that you can manually activate a ridiculously easy event like riding shotgun but project paradise just randomly pops up.
---
Oh look we just completed it staying 1.20 sec on the drums before the event and then with absolutely NO ONE on those after! Incredible! It took like 1.30 min!
---
That's great that someone of your age can remember Hooked on phonics. It's a shame that it seems it didn't help your reading. Well I have things to do so I'm done talking, remember not to get riled up Mr. Karen, high blood pressure is a real problem for men your age.

If you click on the top part of the social menu, where your icon and name show up, Leave Team is an option.

But yes, it is buried and hidden, and I shouldn't be surprised that people don't realize it's there.

Or start your own team and kick those that don't play.

It's not.  Getting Elder rolls the lower tiers automatically.

This is why you can sometimes end up with multiple Rare Rewards.
---
I borrowed a copy right after launch and was pretty underwhelmed but recently gave it another chance after the Wastelanders update (it being on gamepass helped...) and it's a vastly improved experience, like the difference is night and day. Definitely worth giving it a go and I hope you have fun.
---
I guess it‚Äôs technically harder because one of the daily challenges is always ‚Äúdo a daily operation‚Äù. Which answers your first question, end game is slightly better due to daily operations being a thing.
---
I think someone did the math and you can skip 15 days and complete the season scoreboard without relying on double xp/SCORE events, which may or may not come at some point.
---
I don't know what you mean by battle pass but yeah season two is better
---
The same generic insult 3 posts in a row? I really don't even have a response for that. I want to feel bad for you (even more for your poor sense of humor) but that would be a waste of what little brain power I apparently have at my age lol
---
It'd be helpful if Event teams showed what the team was doing. Like when someone is in daily ops it says something like &gt;in daily ops&lt; so I want &gt;in an event&lt;. I prioritize event teams over casual teams cause I like to do the events, but many times there's moments where no one is doing anything so I base hop for player vendors. Then, for example, join a primal cuts just as it is ending cause I didn't realize they were doing an event as soon as I started shopping.
---
So you still have to log in everyday basically to complete the board?
---
That's literally the only one that does it if I'm not mistaken
---
I used to do the same thing. Scorched enemies in Poseidon power plant use pipe pistols.
---
I've killed some three star prime creatures, with better legendaries than that.
---
They said in the patch 22 notes that they improved it but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true (never seen it happen anyway personally)
---
I only join NW for the daily (if it is easy) and yes, those Gauss shotguns kill you by just scratching you.
---
He‚Äôs right about the Phoenix vendor. I think I unlocked all (if not all, I‚Äôm missing one) from crafting and scrapping the gun. 
---
I also don‚Äôt mind modding it for you. I have the next 20 minutes free. Feel welcome to DM me.
---
No I said low health bolstering or a high health PA
---
When they disappear on people before they're looted, those stars end up on the ground like the meat and materials, too. You can totally stroll though and pick up scrip off the dirt.
---
I bow to numbers nerd Gods that put in their own time for things like this. Thank you.
---
A single question: I adore my instigating limb damage Fat Man. Which would do more damage against a single target? Standard or MIRV? Against multiple targets, I assume MIRV.
---
I use it against both, but have never equipped MIRV. I often use it as a CQC, and fear what that might do to me. I could adjust if there is a dramatic difference in effectiveness.
---
Thank you for the help
---
No, I got an explosive (exterminator) 50 from Grahm.
---
and a vampire gatling plasma from Fashnacht.
---
Wait. It‚Äôs an assaultron in power armor? I always just thought that was armor plating!
---
A post I made a while ago. Works for Gauss shotgun or any gauss weapon.

Season two has better rewards. The weight bench gives you a strength buff and towards the end you get a greenhouse set which is amazing for camps. The devs added more weekly challenges so you don‚Äôt have to rely on dailies as much.
---
Thank you so much for the help.
---
I joined  an ops team expecting to do ops
---
I don't want to use hacked items, but uh, do you know anyone?
---
I prefer daily only too at the moment, at least until they fix rad-x.
---
Yah know other people have stuff to do as well right, maybe try sending a message and ask them if they are planning on doing it some more that time, i truly feel your the kind of person who joins the team and instantly starts an op expecting everybody else to stop what they are doing for you.
---
I got kicked for actually doing the op by a group of cunts that just wanted to farm.
---
I had never experienced this before, but got it three times today. Too many people logging in for meat week is killing the servers I guess?
---
My new favorite thing in 76 is to get 3/4 the way in mission countdown and then have the servers crash and I start all over its pretty much the only reason i play
---
My daughter runs into the room when it plays and we sing along.  It's great bonding.
---
It‚Äôs just annoying, that‚Äôs all.
---
In Destiny you can get a sniper with a couple of amazing perks, but if the third one is hip fire, it‚Äôs still gonna bug the shit out of you.
---
Try an ultracite gatling laser. If you use PA you already have the ammo for it and it's very ammo efficient.
---
Lol had a lv12 guy on the team not long ago and made him a kitted out silenced rifle that some 100+ guy snatched up along with a hundred 308 rounds and a pile of stims I dropped him. Messaged him "uh you really need that level 10 hunting rifle there, bud?" but no response. Dickhead.
---
I joined an ops team  expecting  to  do  ops.  Joined the OP and no team no one showed up had to solo the OP. Did very poorly.
---
That‚Äôs a fair assessment and you‚Äôre correct, I should be more mindful of what the team setting is. But, if someone joins a DO team and they don‚Äôt start the event, there‚Äôs also absolutely nothing wrong in just jumping off and starting your own DO team. The speed with which DO teams fill up when started new is usually quite quick. I can understand the overall sentiment; I just think that it‚Äôs silly, especially considering that it‚Äôs just so easy to fix the situation by starting your own team. 
---
The issue is really that people want to join a team made up of seasoned players and don‚Äôt want random level 20s on board. You start your own team, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll get. 
---
I have a level 11 character that can absolutely hold their own in daily ops and I have played with a group of level 100+ randos that were compete idiots. You never know what you‚Äôll get. 
---
What really should happen - and Bethesda, IMO, could offer this functionality - is the ability to set team levels for the event. You‚Äôre a level 200? Cool, if you start a DO team, you can choose to only allow levels 100 and up to join. You‚Äôre a level 40 and want to start a team? Cool, they can cap who can join at level 75 (or whatever). 
---
But still, I say the level of your character is only an indicator of what might be your skill set. If a player knows what they‚Äôre doing, they can contribute no matter what. If they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, it doesn‚Äôt matter what level they are, they‚Äôll slow the whole team down.
---
Playing on controller I'm guessing, and yeah you can, and if not...how the hell are you playing keyboard exclusively that sounds awful lol
---
Woooooo!! I think the machine needed the pie put in to remember what to do
---
Perception:
---
Switch all rifleman perks to commando, tank killer and concentrated fire. All max lvl.
---
Charisma: Tenderizer max lvl.
---
Intelligence: max demolition expert. (If you have an explosive weapon)
---
Agility: Max sneak, covert operative, adrenaline, sneak artist and gun-fu.
---
Luck: Better criticals, critical savvy, grim reapers sprint and starched genes.
---
Anything else is up to you. I would recommend going bloodied. But I can spare you a lvl 40 AAE combat rifle to start off.
---
Use vats and get headshots.
---
Edit: and what mutations do you have?
---
It happened to me for four hours straight today on Xbox. When I came back on at night on the private server it worked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You even keep the tent?
---
People need to account for the xp challenge.
---
Aw, my friend just moved there to be with his wife! üòä I had no idea they didn't celebrate anything there! How interesting. 
---
No PS4 yet, but my partner has been peeing his pants with excitement over Final Fantasy's reworking of his favorite game EVER (I think it's 7?) and it's only available on that platform right now, so methinks we'll be getting one before the end of the year, lol...
---
Eh third star isn‚Äôt a big deal for the Gauss Minigun, unless you aren‚Äôt running bear arms, and then 90rw is nice. 15% reload is the only other one I‚Äôd consider, and it‚Äôs not that big a deal, the Minigun holds a ton of ammo and reloads fast as is. But I feel ya! It took me 40 crafts to get a 1star bloodied; another 25 to turn that into a bloodied FFR. Haven‚Äôt tried to replace that since; it feels like a waste of modules trying to do better!
---
I got a B10% on like my 3rd Plasma Caster though, that felt gooooood
---
Cheers. I'll take a look at that and what it'll entail. I'm not a huge PA user, I just bring my Excavator to the SBQ events at the moment, but I would like to do more of that, so perhaps I'll invest.
---
So uh...like not throwing shade at all here but two decently built characters can do a daily ops in under 8mins easy, so when you say (we had a strangler) I'm assuming 2+ peeps, so that's 100% on you, you or your mates straggled inside the op.
---
Not the tent. That just disappears into the ether.
---
And don‚Äôt freaking kick someone out after they join the op because they‚Äôll get booted from the instance and have to reload
---
I don‚Äôt know, I still disagree with that suggestion. I get enough kills without a godmode, and so do level 200+ players. There are players on console that get 15+ kills every game. That would just be unfair, I feel like.
---
If you're in need of some assistance or supplies I can be of service

Why? Too many pictures of Meg and Paige? üòÇ
---
It should be an option and Foundation should have one too. Hell, F4 gave you the option to travel to Diamond City or to the Market so I don't see why they can't do it here.
---
I'm the same way, I only use PA for the queen and Earle so the fusion cores I get go a long way between those events and using an ultracite gatling laser as needed.
---
The model used in FO4 does like much more like a German shepherd than the original Dogmeat.  Heck, i'd take a poodle that didn't get killed!  üê©
---
What you actually said was 
---
&gt; then run a high health no PA tank
---
After reading that, I thought your "no PA tank" was going to wear bolstering armor.  Anyway, good to know that is not your intention.
---
You do realize there is no timer for people outside the event correct, and the op can be finished in an extremely variable amount of time, so tbh i just think your wrong.
---
Ill start looking, Thank you!

Today? Meat week events like primal cuts. Three days from now? A Colossal Problem, Guided Meditation, Monster Mash, AWOL.

Well it's significantly easier since npcs are higher level and give almost twice the xp
---
For me the game just has issues keeping high res textures on the brotherhood species outfit. But I dunno it's a nice thought
---
The thing that regrows fucking plants is kinda useful. It's a good thing for herbivore vegans out there, I mainly use it to make vegitable starch and just keep grabbin my plants to make 100 - 200 adhesive a time. Also using it for chally feed right now.
---
You missed out the glaive mods that make it one the best melees in the game
---
Did you see the part where it says you can skip 15 days ? 
---
That‚Äôs before double score events..
---
The only other thing I can think of is to double check your Xbox Live subscription
---
We'll just have different opinions. When everyone has the same chance to be the winner, it's fair. That's like saying that having the nuclear briefcase isn't fair because it's able to kill entire areas at a time. 
---
I think it's all about tactics.
---
I should check that out
---
Agreed!
---
Oops yes, faster reload. I added the speed mag so it also a faster fire rate, but that not an affix. I am using vats, and I have other shotguns that melt, this one just... Doesn't. It's like comically bad, worse than a regular shotgun. I've tried juggling mods, but it uniformly sucks.
---
Yeah that was my thought, odd that they didnt add time progression (other than the year jump with wastelanders). Makes it seem like appalacians in 2102 get a lot done in a day üòÖ
---
How much will that cut the time down?
---
If there's only one going off, it's slightly better. If there's more than one, it's not.
---
‚ÄúHey man I‚Äôve got this legacy gatling plasma here, you got anything for trade?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBest I can do is 2 caps‚Äù
---
That would be cool, or one that just roams from camp to camp like Santa would. At first read though you meant a collectron, they already exist haha
---
Only 7 and not 9?
---
You didn't need to log in every day to complete season 1.
---
Yeah, i use gatling laset aswell, but i love using the lmg because no spin up and the not much recoil. The downside of the weapon is ammo, but the ammunition factory legendary perk is making things better
---
Might be that too, I don't live very long being a melee build cause my 450 ballistic protection means NOTHING. Then again they are lvl 60+ and my gear is lvl 50..which is why I think it's occuring.  But it looks like it's literally wearing power armor
---
Yep I have my instigating gauss rifle for classic headshot sniping, with a two-shot tesla for close range [danger] work.
---
My friend recently gifted me a quad gauss rifle that I put a reflex sight on and I'm sorta playing around with like a superheavy combat rifle.
---
Just did, still gold. :( thank you for the suggestion!
---
Edit: although, it is strangely set to renew today. I have recurrent billing, and my bank account can handle the $9.99, but it‚Äôs an odd coincidence....
---
I try to get there early and start a spit as you seem to some credit for that. As soon as the event starts it starts way above zero.
---
I feel you, same thing happened to me.  Funny thing is the other player on my team asked if i wanted him to launch a nuke, and i told him no, i hadn't completed that quest yet.
---
That should not happen with any other quests.  You can still do a silo run, and you will get the quest diamonds to guide you through, but yeah, it sucks.   I could understand if it did it on a PRIVATE team, because then the level of communication is higher, but some rando auto completing your final main line quest?  It sucks...  üëé
---
Considering I made like 2500 plasma cores on the day of patch 22 launch, I'm pretty sure it's the most efficient ammo in existence.
---
I'd love to do one, but I'm only like level 21, and the ones that usually do the DOs are much higher levels, and I don't want them to think I'm just tagging along for the XPs lol. I do actually wanna do my bit to help but idk how people feel about a low leveller like me joining :(
---
You learn weapon mods by scrapping weapons. So loot and scrap weapons when you can, especially early on, i dont know if the game ever actually tells you that.
---
It's kind of odd they don't let it stack to a degree like Jukies does.
---
Good to know! Thanks.

üé∂üé∂ you hear those sleigh bells jingle as scorched are frying toniiiiiightüé∂üé∂ (laser rifle depending)
---
There's a great spot in the Divide where three small rivers meet. There's a bridge over a small canyon and plenty of ponds around for water purifiers or boardwalk type camps. However, it's because of all that it's one of the more popular building spots in the game.
---
The Mire is probably the most gorgeous location in game but building there is challenging and enemy spawns are everywhere.
---
There are plenty of really nice looking cliffside locations to build on around the Monorail Elevator. As for anywhere else, I don't wanna say too much and spoil anyone's hidden gem spots c:
---
Patch notes claimed it was fixed, but teslas have still been causing chain since then.
---
Eh, never bothered with it, the negative effects aint that bad, now if it helped with the effects of speed demon I might use it
---
Daily op counts with any tier you complete, imo still easier than join a match in NW
---
Yeah, agreed. Not everyone has to have the same opinion. I‚Äôm just giving my feedback as a player since Morgantown was dropped, and given the current situation of the gauss shotgun meta.
---
Right now, the combination of low score requirements to make the next level and lots of daily‚Äôs and weeklys makes progressing through the levels much faster.   Numbers are not exact, but close enough = Right now you can gain a level by completing either 5 dailys or 1 weekly + 1 daily.
---
Mid board, the levels are 2-3k apart, so you just doubled the amount of daily‚Äôs you have to complete to make a level.
---
However, When you get to the back half of the board and the score levels are 3-4K apart.
---
The number of daily‚Äôs weeklys is still the same, but the requirements are doubled, so its going to take more time to complete each level. (Double score and XP weekends aside)
---
To that end, I would suggest making as much progress as you can now, so when you get to the other side of the board, you‚Äôll have extra time to work thought the more time consuming levels.
---
And by ammo converter, I assume you referring to the ArmCo ammunition construction appliance that can be bought from Mortimer after reaching max rep with the raiders?  (the ammo converter is a different item altogether).   The Armco produces a modest amount of ammo without any input materials at all.
---
I assume it‚Äôs because by and large mutations are beneficial, sure if you just get them randomly they may be counter to your build, but in general the negatives are outweighed by the positives.
---
On the other hand, junkies is all about addictions, which are all bad
---
The Nuka World commercial!
---
Lunchboxes are by far the best all around choice. Some time in the future we will be able to buy other event rewards and perk packs with gold.
---
Yeah, they did this.  It was a "fix" in the patch at the end of June i think.
---
Yeap! My wife started two weeks later from the beginning of season 1 and she completed it 1 week and a half before it ended.
---
Yeah I really want a gauss version of a combat rifle that could be swapped between full or semi auto, something to compliment the sniper-like regular gauss rifle. Closest thing I have now is just a quad gauss rifle with a dot sight and I just don't charge the shots.
---
Also I didn't know the ammo machine didn't make 2mm, that's kinda disappointing.
---
I get by just fine with class freak and starched genes
---
Im afraid that no one would trigger it, but I agree. I mean they are crying because tea time now it's too hard.. TEA TIME man, that's sad
---
Honestly it's not really worth it.  You have to actively be taking rad damage to heal.  Better to just not take so many rads.
---
I mostly ignore enemies in daily ops TBH.  I don't know if it's because I heavily invested in legendary perks or what, but the damage they do is kind of a joke.  I run sizzling style and energy absorption so laser and fire damage basically does nothing.  Their ballistic damage is kind of a joke too. If they are close enough to do melee damage, then I can easily melt them.
---
Yes but when there's 3/4 people already in the ops I'm sure they assume you're actually doing it.
---
Oh that‚Äôs just my 8 year old pc trying to tell me something, disregard that
---
FF7 remake was good! Keep in mind it's not the entire game. The remake will be released in parts, probably years apart. 
---
PS4 will probably be much cheaper when PS5 comes out. I recently upgraded to a PS4 Pro. My launch PS4 really struggled playing recent games. Thing nearly blew up playing Horizon, FF7 and Ghost of Tsushima. So I suggest getting a PRO.
---
And with class freak3, negatives are Significantly reduced.  
---
  Between CF3 and the right perk choices (and/or good rolls on legendaries), you can reduce the negatives to near zero.
---
An event that spawns at graveyards called graveyard smash that plays the monster mash song and you have to get drunk with grahm who is there with his broken down caravan or whatever, fighting off waves of ghouls that have the marsupial mutation...........
---
The xp reward from killing the enemies is a joke too üòÇ
---
Had this problem yesterday had to server hop 4 times to find people who would join in instead of just sit in the group.
---
Or use a different gun for killing things and then swap to the lmg at the end just before the boss dies. What ever weapon you have in hand when the boss dies is what you get as an Ammo reward
---
Right, then with strange in numbers, the benefits are further boosted 
---
So, giving even 5% per mutation...oh no, poor me
---
Delete all those photos of the foundation saw mill?  You do not need to keep those at all.
---
As a heavy with a gatling laser/plasma, I‚Äôm truly sorry
---
Agree! Also, how do you leave a team? Something i couldn't figure out, only leaving server and rejoin..
---
You should get Cola Nut and find yourself a reliable supplier for Nuka Cola Quantums. 600 HP and 300 AP.
---
Ofc rifles save ammo too, and i have the rifle perks aswell, what other perks do u use ?
---
Amen!!!!
---
Two guys that randomly show up at old peoples houses, rummage through their things, then guilt/hard press them into selling stuff they don't really want to sell. Even going to far as to pretend they really want it for themselves as a collector and how much it would mean to have it.  Then selling it in their shop for 3x+ what they bought it for.
---
Yeah man, it's a tragedy. Too much waiting! But the quest was hilarious. We loved hating it!
---
This was already posted by someone 5 hours ago and it hit "Hot"
---
Yes, always donate the reward (what I am referring to here is Ward's daily quest, not the bullion from the vault mission) and when doing the picture quest for Davenport, the robot in the overseer's house, chose to take pictures of the raider compound.  Once you have the pix, give them to Ward at foundation for a little added settler rep every day.  Then go back to Davenport and lie to him about how raiders stole your pictures (if you can meet the speech check) and you'll still get some caps.
---
You multiply them.  So it's a percentage of what remains from the first.
---
Bigg Daddy Todd's work!
---
You can delete the ones you don't like through the menu, but if youre on PC, you can just move them out of the save directory manually.
---
Probably not. Bethesda considers the game as stable and so main focus is on new content now Microsoft doesn‚Äôt get a voice for another 8-12 months if the sale gets approved.
---
Thank you for your work!
---
When the hell are they going to change the daily ops reset time like they said they would
---
I just started playing like 3 weeks ago.  I was doing fine until the patch and everything scaled.  Now I have no ammo.  No junk to repair my gear.  Just hit level 50.  And I'm camp jumping everyday trying to buy ammo.  Before the update I had tons of ammo I just sold or gave away.  Now I go farm 308 and run out of shotgun ammo.  Make a run on shotgun ammo and run out of 308.
---
I‚Äôm not spec‚Äòed for heavies, but when I need one, its a vampire 50 or vampire gatling plasma.  
---
To that end, I opted to give a few points to stabilized to help out.
---
Unmodified by foods/chems, I only get about 50dmg per hit, but it is tough to beat the health regen :)
---
I hopped in a group today and waited to see if someone would start. They didn‚Äôt so I did. I was 3/4 through boosting the first signal when they finally joined. Finished with 10 seconds to spare.
---
Yea ruined the entire way I liked to build wtf are half the wall shapes for if not to build down from the roof
---
Foundations main stuff is outside, craters is inside. It makes me head to foundation more often because I can get to the bullion dispenser faster.
---
I'm late to this party but was looking for confirmation that hack and slash does explosive damage. Maybe this is in angry turtle vid, will watch that next, but someone on reddit mentioned that the explosive dmg perks increase the damage of that explosive effect.
---
I'm messing with my unarmed build in nukes and dragon to see if explosive dmg perks can be fit in without taking out something better. It is fun at least to blow things up! Though finding the bodies can be annoying as mentioned.
---
Also wondering if it's dumb to think about  eventually rolling with hack and slash and exploding palm for an unarmed build if committing to the explosive effect. Though it might be nice to know that nonVATS attacks will never blow the thing away from you if it's like a 3 star legendary where the body could get lost.
---
I found max ammomith and legendary ammo factory rank 2 is the best deal for ultracite 308, and rank 1 in super duper. Dont need to rank up ammo factory that high since ops generates ammo and with something like an lmg that's more of a special sauce weapon you shouldnt use on trash mobs outside of ops anyway
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once, but another thing, people need to stop walking past the timer start barrier before the team arrives
---
What I want is for the Daily Ops to tell me if someone is already in it or not.  Often, it tells me ‚Äúpress Esc to join,‚Äù but when I load in, nobody else is there. 
---
The last time I decided to ‚Äújoin‚Äù, there was nobody else there and it took me 30 minutes and half as many deaths to complete the bloody thing. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äújoin‚Äù and ‚Äústart,‚Äù and I rather suspect the developers are mixed up on that point.
---
At least the public events show you how many people already joined and how long ago it started. Can‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt have the same for their latest content.
---
Very nice. I love the use of the location
---
 It doesn‚Äôt mean anything and auto completes if you are on a map and ANYONE launches a nuke.
---
It doesn‚Äôt affect your game in any way, aside from competing the quest, and you can still do the solo and launch one after you get to that point.
---
Honestly take your time and complete the main storyline first, you'll find it much more enjoyable. DO's aren't going anywhere, you'll get your chance with them don't worry.
---
Wow that sounds like a good idea. I totally forgot about monster mash idk why people are down voting this but whatever
---
In the bottom right where it tells you who's in your squad, it'll say (IN DAILY OPS) after their name if they're in it.
---
Change your Gaus mini to ultracite rounds, you get more per craft, the mats aren't too hard to get and with legendary perks/daily ops you will be swimming in ultracite 2mm EC ammo
---
Let me call my buddy who‚Äôs an expert in fallout 76 trading
---
Nope, it's 180 according to everything I have seen.
---
If you still need the plan, let me know. We can run it a few times.
---
Ty that seems to be the consensus
---
Or don't randomly join my team as we're all switching characters expecting us to run into the event when you do.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What negative effects are you countering that's worth losing 15% damage over? You running egg head on a melee build?
---
I posted something similar a few weeks ago and was quickly downvoted. The rude are rude.
---
As long as you have at least 9 strength which you should since you run shotguns you should be good just switching out perk cards for heavy gunner dmg. No need to change anything around unless you plan on using PA. Definitely work on ranking up ‚Äútaking one for the team‚Äù legendary perk
---
I'm not saying this is you but it has happened
---
BoS was a joke they slapped together for the event. It was supposed to help to get the event scrap but it was garbo compared to the scrap mode. Now they finished the event it needs to be updated. Energy ammo would be nice as the raider gets to ballistic ammo
---
My neighbor was why I started playing. 
---
The community is why I stuck around.
---
Maybe Smiley restocks them every Tuesday on his way to get more gold...
---
Do you have Bos gas mask pyjama thing outfit noob here and it's just so cool
---
Pig Foot Pete is an absolute banger.
---
If you use pa casually as in a pa hybrid sort of build, then rank 2 is fine. Maybe rank 3 if full health build. To give u an idea, I run a half health hybrid build and use diluted radaways with rank 2 ghoulish in pa in nuke zones. Mind you if I am using a vamp weapon or born survivor, I dont need super fast heals from ghoulish. It'll be boosted from those. And sometimes I'll let my rads drop to low health for a moment for nerd rage, emergency protocols, and adrenal reaction mutation, and if not aggro, then can do some nice boosted dps briefly before using a diluted radaway back up to half health ish
---
Yeah, that's fair.  But it still feels underwhelming at a flat +10 DR or +10% damage.
---
An explosive (exterminator) 50 what?
---
Psn - OxyShow
---
I help you üòä
---
Also extremely annoying, I think it's cause a lot of people don't realise that's how the timer starts. Good old Bethesda didn't really give much of a tutorial for their first time-based reward system in something like this.
---
Instant Level 3 access to all terminals, skip pretty much every time consuming stage and make the robots annihilate each other.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get the power armor icon you get at rank 45 in NW. Because it‚Äôs cool
---
Do you need to log in every day? Cos if so I'm fucked cos I took like 5 days off
---
Stop gatekeeping this event and comparing your skill level to others.
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken this quest completes whenever a nuke touches down, regardless of being on a team or not. The timer counts down, the nuke hits, and then everyone‚Äôs quest completes. The next time anyone launches a nuke the exact same thing will happen, no matter how many you‚Äôve launched before. You‚Äôll still complete a separate quest and ‚Äúfinish the main story‚Äù after launching your own nuke; your endgame is still in tact. As others have said also, no other quests in the game (as of now) are like this.
---
Same here. Unless I have to photograph Meg (and I usually just choose Foundation) or need to buy something from Maximillian, I go to Foundation.
---
Absolutely fine, but change your team goal or join a different group. Daily ops groups are for doing Daily ops, that's it.
---
It does though with the food
---
You have nothing to worry about, they made this season much easier.
---
Nukashine because 1. I managed to remember to log in every day to get it and 2. I'm still bitter I dont have the Easter bunny head cuz I missed some days
---
If your brave you could try the glow mods if you on PC. I carry my camera with scout night vision lens to spot missing bodies.
---
Level 46 lol
---
Then give some sort of signal to the person who's just joined letting them know what's what your waiting for, don't just ignore it.
---
I primed an instigating plasma caster and the thing just shreds mobs. With maxed ammo factory you make over 500 rounds of ammo for one cobalt flux without super duper kicking in. Best ammo economy in the game.
---
I'm sure there's a way to do it with a controller, but I wouldn't know what that is.
---
I think people are downvoting because Bethesda has said there are no plans for new songs, new songs are expensive to license, and we already know the Halloween event is Bombs Drop.
---
Yeah. I grinded out the first season and then grinded out meat week the first time.. I just really needed a break I'm currently rank 23. Am I good or fucked?
---
Lots of people have that issue, seems to always be with the last mission of launching nukes as well. Good old Bethesda letting other people take that away from you.
---
It's 52040 XP for level 325.
---
you should get 5 times the earn 10,000 XP reward per level
---
Vault 94 Gold because apparently I'm a masochist who enjoyed a sometimes buggy, often laggy, timed raid.
---
Well some people still aren't getting the message
---
Wow. Absolutely amazing. Time well spent. üòç
---
But usually we hop back into DOs, so we just don‚Äôt bother to change it. Theirs usually like 3 DOTs on any given server
---
Yeah i know about the bombs drop event but I didn't know about the no new songs but thanks for telling me.
---
Responders. Cause I ain't no raider.
---
Well now I feel inferior, thanks for that!
---
Just play a lot when there's double XP and you should be fine I'm sure.
---
I usually do
---
They really are a legal hassle to deal with; it‚Äôs why most of the 76 songs are songs from 3 and 4 already. There was a dev interview this year where they admit theres no plans to add more songs at the moment.
---
Still not the point. It costs nothing to finish, change to casual, do whatever you want, change back to Daily Ops and carry on. It does, however, cost me my time of sitting in a lobby with people who aren't doing what their group says they are.
---
No idea...
---
Grafton monster cause he's adorable
---
Yeah sorry it was one of the "rewards" for the atlas event.
---
Oh, seemed like there was a fuss over not waiting for people to come to the event or something.
---
This bug works even if pacifist is on, found out yesterday the hard way, lost a bunch of flux while attempting to put it in the scrap box. Reset the pacifist by turning it off and on and still got killed. Wasn‚Äôt in pvp with the other person. Best bet until this gets addressed is to change servers or block the person, hopefully it gets patched, try to ignore these people not worth the headache.
---
Montage of all the times you've died to a car, roach, cliff...
---
Mothman cultist. Only because no Mr. Pebbles. So I chose the second great God on the list.
---
I've had more of an issue if joining a DO team and the leader doesn't initiate actual doing a DO. I'll be the 1st to join, a couple more join in. At first I guessed the leader was letting the bonds form before starting. Nope. After some time I jumped servers and found an active team.
---
Maybe I'm expecting too much by looking for a leader to take the lead.
---
Not a good build.
---
There was a mass weapon/gear dupe a few months back. There are hundreds of god tier items floating around now, probably thousands. People were just giving them away before they patched it out. Some got banned, and some had their inventories wiped, but most dupers got away with it.
---
Whitesprings, Beckett can sell them, and if you have the TNT bunker keys there are usually a handful in there.
---
Revive again *sigh*
---
Oooh, Grafton High poster after the Grafton High hat. Neat! I gotta try and scrounge up some more atoms for that.
---
And thats why i dont drop my radways even if i have over 300
---
Yeah new songs would be good but too expensive and theirs better things to do with their money then try to get rights to a song.
---
They just dont get the lore.
---
Mirelurks always count as glowing. Problem solved.
---
I can't count the times that I have just finished the op and the other members jump in. Then they get mad when I dont want to run it again. I mean they had nine minutes to jump in, i always wait two minutes to give people a chance to start it before i try it in my own. But the most annoying thing is to start the daily op and the people who joined the team just go afk in the first room.
---
I like the items more
---
Lightening Bolt.  Because, honestly:
---
https://youtu.be/j_ekugPKqFw
---
Not a battle pass. 
---
Yes there technically is 250 more per day available.
---
I use have a day, it gets my point across.
---
You're not my dad!
---
I know....I just find it funny / not funny to see level 50 players running around with god-tier legacies.
---
Which glaive mod in particular makes up for the big physical damage loss? I know that Fire damage is flat and unresisted, but Incisor kind of makes that not worth cutting the physical damage in half. Does the cryo blade add some interesting things?
---
Today was a good day. Guy started it, I immediately joined with another person. 3 man team in less than 8 minutes from join to finish. Awesome job fellas. They knew exactly what to do. It was wonderful.
---
Maybe I am? Go to your room!
---
Absolutely.  You won't be the absolute best at both, but still good enough to pass whatever challenge the game can throw at you.  Don't buy into this "Yeah, but you'll be half-assed" nonsense.
---
Eh... only thing I‚Äôm excited about is the greenhouse.
---
Did you try another game online first then try fallout? Weird I know.
---
Better solution, just keep running the ops. The bonus is for more ops exp anyway. Makes no fucking sense to just sit around holding hands and singing kumbaya until the whole team is bonded with friendship bracelets. 
---
Run ops and build up your teamwork and cohesion. If you find someone that is a problem every single op, either coach them or yeet them.
---
Edit: Spelling and a word.
---
You're*
---
That‚Äôs an additional challenge. So you can skip it and be in the same position as season 1
---
But i'm in my room? ;_;
---
You'll enjoy it, been playing since beta. It's came a extremely long way.
---
But only the host can change a team, if I'm left with no other option it's really outside of my control.
---
Daily Ops just reset... 
---
Location: Galleria
---
Faction: Robots
---
Mutation: Volatile
---
Welcome to the community!
---
Workshops were designed to be a PvP area, not somewhere you build up and farm a significant amount of resources from.
---
Sure the resources are there, but they give so little that it's not worth relying on them. It's meant to be a small bonus from controlling a contestable sector in PvP, rather than something you farm.
---
Capturing one is optional. I would only be in favour of a rework if they first implemented another way to pvp, or brought back survival mode.
---
there are higher then 3 star in the game code, but not in the game unless someone used a hack a long time ago to make one, if they did i dont know about any . 
---
there are no way to get 3 star every time, its the luck of the draw unless your buying them
---
But i'm already in my room? ;_;
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can kill it for you.
---
What was the last free icon. The game auto equips them for some stupid reason so ive stopped re-applying them.
---
Truly or a joke?
---
Daily ops just reset 7 minutes ago. Log out/log in if needed.
---
they should have reset 7 minutes ago, exactly 1 hour after the daily challenges reset
---
Just get a legendary against the type. There, you have your extra gun specific to enemy type,enjoy.
---
This need to stop with the wood armor paint.... i have never ever ever made wood armor.
---
They claim they want to fix pvp, a good start would make these worth taking and holding. Pvp would happen naturally instead of trying survival servers or nuclear winter. 
---
The only one worth holding at this time is the ammo factory, and honestly most still don‚Äôt bother.
---
Yes I did, it worked.
---
Already added that.
---
That sucks, I must be lucky every time I went there the event ended super fast, almost too fast actually. That may be an issue on the other extreme side, the event will end waaaay too fast if people know what they're doing.
---
They're not joking, it unlocks at level 46.
---
KILL THEM ALL GOD WILL UNDERSTAND
---
It won‚Äôt let you have two of the same maxed out perks, you‚Äôll need to scrap the non animated ones to level up the animated ones
---
Thank you, sir!
---
Ha! I need patience.....
---
1 cap all ammo, 25cap plans, 350 3 stars.
---
Facts, I tried joining public ops teams to do them and they kept leaving whenever I started one up
---
If you load the game, and somebody is in your camp spot then you‚Äôll get a notification saying ‚Äúyour camp cannot be placed, would you like to stay or find a new world‚Äù
---
Basically it‚Äôs telling you that you can stay in that server. Your camp obviously won‚Äôt be there, BUT if you wanted to pick a brand new location. You can go and place down your camp anywhere FOR FREE
---
However, if you decide NOT to stay in that server, click on the option that says find new world. Then the game will throw you in a brand new server. Hopefully one where your camp can spawn. If not, it will just be a repeat and you have to find a new server again.
---
its rng at its finest i got 3 plans in one op tuesday.
---
0 rewards since.
---
There was a black one a while ago that was grossly over priced and looked very dull. I guess everyone else shares my feelings for it since I've literally never seen a single camp using it. A display with a cool design and a decent price would be nice to see.
---
&gt;Why the hell do they keep doing this with the Atom Shop?
---
Generates sales.
---
I drop legendaries all the time usually at a train station and plans there‚Äôs only so much you can carry most of the time I put extra bullets in my vendors for free there‚Äôs not much I don‚Äôt have at level 310 but you always need space
---
Fire damage seems to be the best but doesn't work with Friendly Fire because reasons. 
---
Cryo slows enemies similar to the Cryolator. Good if you need to hit them multiple times, useless if not.
---
I have every storage perk available so I carry like 500?lbs of shiz
---
[Click here for the codes](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
I don‚Äôt clearly understand what the question is here. What does scout/forest armor have to do with leather?
---
I know a guy. He sells me them in bulk, 500 at a time.
---
I enjoyed fallout76 when I started playing playing a few months back. After doing the main story and fighting through a plethora of bugs (even though it‚Äôs been out for years) i brunt myself out. All the cool shut was locked in the atom shop. All the essential things you need for quality of life, locked behind the subscription.
---
I knew what I was getting myself in for but fuck it, I love fallout games. But this is the last Bethesda game I‚Äôll ever play
---
If you could get it above 100 it might be.
---
Lol of all the reasons to quit a game I find it funny that someone would choose to do so over a cosmetic item.
---
Workshops are free supplies in most cases, as long as the number is green, **it‚Äôs not costing you anything** workshops are also great sources of additional plans for CAMPs.
---
Power Plants are the best places to get Fusion Cores. Grafting Steel has the highest production of Steel. Hemlock Holes Maintenance is a great acid source.
---
Once you set up a workshop, it just keeps making supplies for you, for free, with the occasional event to defend them.
---
People avoid them mostly because they don‚Äôt want the PVP aspect.
---
So the game sucks because you missed out on a limited time event? 
---
Talk about some insane levels of whining and entitlement. Lol.
---
Somewhat related. Where do you find the pristine US flag plans? I've only ever managed to find the tattered one.
---
Lol, i need to try this. Especially when they are volatile
---
Because forest/urban are classed as different armours, does that mean sturdy, light or heavy leather/raider etc are classed different because of their prefix.
---
also prime flamer fuel too please xD
---
God damn that's a lot of cola.
---
one of the rewards from season 2 is a camouflaged recolor of that skin.
---
it's something like level 70 though.
---
no, it's not
---
TS and Limb Damage cause some kind of additional damage effect in calculations together. I can confirm this because I have a TS Limb Damage Fixer that does way more damage than it should and I tested the damage numbers with other Fixers.
---
Imagine being this butthurt over an optional cosmetic. (That will almost certainly return soon, they usually do)
---
Review bombing the game because you're salty you missed an atom shop item is childish.
---
If beth has released an atom skin for the tesla, i missed it. There are non currently available
---
I'm pretty sure it's just the type of armor, not heavy vs light.
---
Pc or console?
---
I would love to have a wall shelf display for them. But, I don't see Bethesda doing it. So, a more pleasant design than the blue for them would be great.
---
You can get it from the tadpole vendor, I think it's 2 tadpole point thingys?
---
The ammo and food factory are useful. Every power plant is useful for cores, and the mining rig set me up with all the scrap after smelting.
---
That‚Äôs six I still find uses for. Though I really don‚Äôt think they need any porpoise, those poor things wouldn‚Äôt do very well on land like that.
---
Open scoreboard in menu screen before loading into world. It prevents the score from counting from zero at least.
---
Yes mate
---
Rush the Wastelander quest and get your God Bullion grind going. Dont waste a month to get it done like I did and lose out on 6k bullion your gonna need. Welcome to the Wasteland.
---
I think it would be in VATS, but with high rate of fire weapons you burn through your AP too quickly to make much of it.
---
lol, you think you are doing such a service leaving a little salty review over something so trivial.
---
Console, they just create five star weapons on PC.
---
Thank you very much
---
That's good to know. Thanks.
---
Not everyone cares if they have to spend a few more rounds to kill something, like 15% is good, but its not a game changer
---
I'm having the same issue. No solution yet :(
---
The folks over there are going Atom‚Äôs work üôè
---
You should Add TheWearyExile on PSN. I'll craft you sum gear and weapons and ammo to get you going. Could even help progress your Gold Bullion story line.  I wouldnt sleep on getting it done.
---
It's not too hard to test though.  Just get a set of non matching leather and see.
---
I save my nuke escapades for people that take my workshops and lock out legendary spawns at events with obviously hacked weapons
---
I really need to a mic to thank but tell other players I'm using my low level alt and don't need items.
---
So where does the option pop up to use the legendary modules, cause I still haven't figured this out lmao
---
A liberator because I think they're faintly adorable.
---
True. I will when I'm next online. Cheers.
---
Nope. Still a grind.
---
With your perks, you can just hit a few weight rooms now and again and just craft what you need without much problem. If you need consistent acid, you can take hemlock holes maintenance up North. It‚Äôll net you 30 acid every time you collect with little effort. 
---
By doing theirs every now and again, I rarely dip below 20k .556 and I blow through it on my commando.
---
Giddyup Buttercup!  Because ponies.  It's the only icon i spent atoms on.
---
Let me try, maybe he‚Äôll get it this time.
---
You can miss 15 days currently and still finish. There‚Äôs going to be double score weekends too, which means you could miss more days if you play on those weekends.
---
Yeah. I run out every other day too. I‚Äôm convinced he dupes them on demand, but won‚Äôt tell me how.
---
I‚Äôm just sick of getting into uplink and people going buck wild and migrating farther from the objective than birds flying south for the winter.
---
And boy will they. Lol
---
Nuka girl

Ive been testing lately and I feel the same way. I have an AAE and a BFFR so I would like just an E to test the difference.
---
After i finish a daily ops in a team i usually stick to it if there is no casual one, so i can keep inspirational active while i do my own stuff.
---
Don't forget the mire.
---
Nuka Girl. Because Nuka Girl!
---
plasma is the future
---
This just personal. I think fast traveling to foundation should be closer in the center.
---
Idk wood armor even existed in this game. I thought leather was the lowest you could get
---
I only speak from experience lol
---
It‚Äôs available from the tadpole vending machine, you‚Äôll have to complete 3 badges to purchase one. It will give you the wall flag and an indoor flag pole but doesn‚Äôt include the tall waving flag.
---
It's pretty hard to hit moving targets outside of VATS with the PC.
---
I primarily do use VATS and have a +33 Instigating PC that I love, but the OP may be a non-VATS user.
---
Those are good times.  üôÇ
---
Thanks - that's reassuring to know.
---
Dedicated
---
Wood only comes in light. 
---
Leather, Metal, Combat, Raider, And robot comes in light, sturdy, heavy
---
Marine, Trapper, Scout AND forest only comes in sturdy. (Scout and forest count as two totally different armors even though they look the same just different paint) my friend has 4 scout armor pieces, and she tried wearing a forest chest piece and the resistance didn‚Äôt work. 
---
Secret service only comes in heavy. 
---
I hope that sorts answers what you were asking?
---
Now you mentioned something about legendary perks. If you‚Äôre going to equip the legendary perk, for example funky duds.  The description says you get a certain protection when you wear a matching set. 
---
That means ALL 5 pieces of armor HAVE to be the same armor type. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if they all have to be the same sturdy, light, or heavy. Or if it can be a mix of all 3 as long as it falls under the same armor name. Maybe somebody else can answer that.
---
Welp... back to the endless grind I guess. Thanks.
---
That's weird then, there is no reason you shouldn't be selling. I'm playing on ps4 though, I cant speak to the economy on other systems. Good luck hopefully your stuff will start moving
---
Oh wow if I ran across your Camp I would have definitely bought a couple hundred caps worth, I can never get enough FCs üòÑ
---
I pretty much just started on Steam, so I've been in the forest mostly, and the Savage Divide cause that's where my Camp is set up. I hadn't considered other players might be selling ammo, I'll have to look at a few more vending machines when I'm on again.
---
I just did this on my alts the other day. Great advice!
---
sorry for the lack of clarity.    
---
Exterminators explosive 50 cal.
---
personally, don‚Äôt care about the exterminator part, but the explosive could be fun üòÄ
---
I wish you could load in previously built structures after taking a workshop with no material cost. This would add a feel of permanence. Just pick up where you left off the from the last time you had the workshop. I want to scratch my building itch, but the loss of resources and my need for perfect placement makes it unappealing.
---
Charming
---
Yeah at least survive 10 mins or kill mobs in NW I can do with randoms easily and doesn't require any PvP skill. I forgo the revive challenge as I know I likely won't get it
---
Thanksüòã
---
Nah.
---
Ps4 as well.
---
Since returning iv yet to become wanted a single time. Took out a few though. Poor sods got the JE1P Minigun.
---
And then they leave immediately because they fail to understand you may want to get the bonds maxed before starting it.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre on pc or console, and I don‚Äôt know if you bought a digital copy or a real copy. 
---
I don‚Äôt see how you can buy the game, and it comes with a free trial for the game??
---
The ONLY thing I could think of is that you bought the game but you also went and downloaded the beta? But even that doesn‚Äôt make sense. 
---
Best option in my opinion might be to delete the game. Or uninstall it. Redownload it.  Hopefully it was just a a bug.
---
Just change keep server till you get a team or make your own team. Better yet just get on mic and ask. It's such a none issue for people with a brain lmao
---
Atom shop is down for me too. It's probably maintenance.
---
Meat Week is honestly kind of boring and is over within 1-2 minutes usually. Fasnacht was much better, there was more time for people to interact and you could actually get worthwhile legendaries instead of a 1 star paper weight each time.
---
I'd love to throw up a canada flag, role play it as "they occupied us during the war, now it's our turn"
---
Betting they wished they duped aa ones jow the demand for them is nuts lol
---
The game? Not so much. The community? Best online people I‚Äôve come across.
---
Dude, it's a dumb way to market their game. And how is it review bombing? I've put a ton of time into the game, and I've seen that they're still doing dumb shit like this. So yeah, they get a negative review from me.
---
Review bombing would be if I hadn't played or purchased the game, but gave it a negative review regardless due to group think.
---
Ahhh right. Yeah the Exterminator part is bleh. Hopefully you'll get a good replacement eventually.
---
I knew the playerbase would get annoying with this kinda PSA bullshit so I just run it solo now. Not a single day has gone by where I‚Äôve managed to not get Elder so I‚Äôm more or less content on soloing it so I don‚Äôt have to encounter whiners.
---
FYI if a high level player approaches you, more than likely he wants to dump spare stuff for you, as long as you aren‚Äôt controlling a workshop 99.9% of players ignore pvp
---
The straw that breaks the camel's back.
---
Best advice is to take it slow like others have said alr3ady. When I started I was getting owned but once you get the hang if things it's a really good game. Just don't be too daunted and put off by the amount of micro management like stash limit! And make sure your camp is in a nice spot!
---
I personally keep final word for queen raids. It's my only primed gun, and absolutely shreds at line in the sand or scorched earth
---
This community is seriously one of the best communities of gamers I've ever been a part of. Everyone I've met ingame is helpful. From dropping plans to escorting lvl2s to watoga, the sense of community in this game is great and I'm glad I started playing it as my first Fallout game
---
I feel that, talking to people is so awkward especially in fallout
---
There‚Äôs a mod in Fallout 4 that includes the state flags of the American commonwealths in the Fallout universe, something like that would be pretty awesome to see.
---
I think I spend the least amount of time in The Mire. I hate it.
---
Your on ps4 , I have a nice level 5 vamps explosive hunting rifle for you . Have fun in the wasteland üòÅüëç
---
I can solo it if you want to join and do it a couple of times. (PS4)
---
Yeah wanted folks are rare for me and I'm to high level so if i become wanted nobody even tries to kill me. But because of the challenges workshop season is in full swing combined with my trap base I have no shortage of little goody bags to pick up.
---
I steady try to help the newbies out. With my VE15 Pump (used as a secondary tool, Heavy Guns all day) I dont even need stims so I gift them out. I woulda loved even a hint of help pre level 50, and that was well before One Wasteland. Must be tuff nowadays.
---
Unless you're going to be running a new Op every 10 minutes, telling people not to do other activities in between Ops is just incredibly ignorant and dismissive.
---
Will never happen. Because then you could potentially just farm the daily ops for an hour or two and maybe get all the plans in one day.  
---
Events and missions like this are purposely made to be a grind so you come back and play more. You giving the game your caps doesn‚Äôt benefit them in any way. Virtual money that essentially means nothing in the game to the developers. 
---
MAYBE if you had to pay atom points to get a second chance, that way people would spend money to buy atom points to try again. Then maybe they would do something like that. But caps? It wouldn‚Äôt be cheap either. And then we‚Äôd get posts from people complaining about how they have spent 2-3,000 caps repeating daily ops and haven‚Äôt gotten any rare plans.
---
Trap Base. Thhhhhaaaaaattttsssss tuff.
---
Revive is just impossible to get, the enemy always gun down downed enemies and don't even think about checking to see if they can lure out a team mate
---
Raiders is easier. There is a daily queen meat turn in and a daily quest to protect the water pipe. Each give rep.
---
Entitlement? I'm giving an opinion on something with the game that I think is BS, and with a product that I spent money on, and that I'm willing to continue putting money into.
---
I didn't know feedback is entitlement when it comes to a purchased product.
---
Talk about insane levels of boot licking.
---
Definitely focus on meelee at first and scrap everything you can! Its the best way to learn mods so that you can make yourself a good weapon later. Go to peoples camps! Its likely you'll find a radiation shower. Rads are pretty annoying early game. If you get a legendary weapon you don't want (or if high level players drop you a bunch) go to a train station and turn it in at the legendary scrip machine. You'll eventually find a place where you can turn that in for a chance at better weapons or armor.
---
But generally people are amazing. One time I needed a fusion core while stuck in the woods and a guy actually came to the rescue
---
Not that it really matters at the  end of the day,  but why am I getting down voted for having the right to forming an opinion, it just shows the aragents of some people, and the simplest fact they can't get over them selfs. Lmao ü§£ it such a shame that your insecurities have gotten the best of you! There are pills üíä üò≥ for that.
---
Watoga station has plans for around 1K caps
---
Welcome to the family. 
---
Do enjoy your stay.
---
It‚Äôs been down a couple times this week for me, now. Not sure what the deal is.probably has to do with the random atoms bug recently.
---
I've honestly wanted power armor unarmed to be viable just for this song. Do one fist rusted knuckles, one fist tesla.
---
Or a lobber barrel.
---
It does but barely. After the damage adjustments, perks like iron fist/gladiator etc do not have much affect. I removed iron fist and added defensive perk
---
Yes.  Iron fist is the only perk that increases the damage of your punches, the power fist, the deathclaw gauntlet, the brass knuckles, the boxing glove, the new gauntlet you buy with gold (I forgot the name) and I THINK the meat hook? Unless that‚Äôs gladiator.
---
The minigun, because I collect explosive miniguns.
---
Some people are using ops to farm ammo. If you've gotten elder once already its nbd
---
I could alsom point out some weapons that needed to be added
---
M16/m4
---
Kar98
---
Mp40
---
Luger
---
M1911
---
M9 beretta
---
Karl gustav
---
M60
---
  LOL
---
That means it‚Äôs updating, being worked on, or about to be reset. It‚Äôs nothing to panic or worry about. Just give it an hour or two.
---
I thought i remembered in the last itv they said the next patch?
---
Thanks for the explanation. I run the perks with my matching scout armour etc, but making a new set and was unsure about the prefix. Thanks very much for taking the time to answer clearly and on point.
---
Huh, weird that you assumed I was being of such service by making a simple post in regards to a product that I purchased with feedback on a reddit about discussing said product.
---
Right forgot about that
---
Right?
---
Ok good thank you its just that i have never gotten that pop up
---
Cheers.
---
Precisely this.
---
Anything that makes the game less of an annoying chore, such as inventory/camp weight is behind a paywall. Anything cool, behind a paywall plus timed exclusive.
---
It's just anti consumer and anti good game design.
---
Have a look at nukes and dragons website and plan your build so you can try get the right perks from the start .... it will save you in the long run.
---
Also the trick to holding 3 pylons that works for me is. Born survivor, autostim (armor), field surgeon, dodgy, serendipity, ricochet, blocker, refractor and the inteligence perk to have stems heal more (all max rank). For weapons use plasma, laser exp if you have or troubleshooter.
---
Definietly go with melee weapons first to save ammo. Unless you have fallout 1st then you can start a private world and hit all of the locations with a lot of lead for ammo. (Charleston Fire Station has a gym) 
---
Also scrap high level weapons and armour you can't use as this unlocks the mods to craft onto other weapons!
---
We change to daily ops right before completing the op. Casual for that intelligence bonus on all the kills up until right before completion.
---
Oofta.
---
Non Legendaries can be recrafted at a higher level if you have the plan
---
If the weapon/armor is Legendary, you are pretty much SOL unless RNG grants you a drop from an event or Mrgph.
---
Exceptions are Blade of Bastet and a couple others - you can recraft those higher\_IF\_ you still have the original item.
---
  I believe the Gutter plan is now a random drop from Daily Ops, so you can remake that one as well.
---
Hey man we got this camo AR-10 skin available atm with season 2. Just needs around rank 70 so that's about 10k+ atoms. Since you seem so enthusiastic about this AR-10, thought you would defo purchase atoms to get this skin since you so cool with atoms. Let us know after the purchase with screenshots
---
AA because it has a faster Fire Rate.
---
Its overkill on mobs but perfect for Bosses. The Final Word is the best weapon to have right now if you dont have an AA/FR Gatling Laser/Plasma.
---
Why GL/GP because the GL's ammo can be doubled with a perk and GP has stronger base damage. 
---
A better one would be AA Gauss Minigun because is has FR and Ex by default.
---
Have not had that happen. But I have been on the uplink and the bar stopped progressing to completion. Had to bail and start over. 
---
So yah, they are buggy.
---
What's your gamertag, when I get on later I'll add you
---
It's review bombing in my opinion cause it's a really stupid and childish reason to give the game a negative review.
---
You play this game alot, so to some degree you enjoy it I assume. So why turn away a prospective new player with a shit review because you're salty over a weapon skin? Really? People who leave bad reviews on game they have literally hundreds of hours in are cringe, and just make themselves look like idiots.
---
There's another skin almost identical to the one you missed out on available as a season 2 reward. But you probably don't want to actually earn the reward by playing, you just want to be able to buy it immediately.
---
Oh I know, I was just giving them a heads up from me.
---
Yup, its basically (with fletchette) an explosive shotgun but with infinite ammo.
---
I wonder if a Quad/Explosive/Reload exist legit in game.
---
Whoa... 10k?!
---
Hahah, thanks for the info man but...ughhhhh... Yeah that's too much haha! I'd say the skin is worth 500 Atoms to maybe 1k  atoms at most.
---
Or just wait u til the bond is full before launching? It's common sense.
---
Had that on PS4 last night after daily ops crashed on th reward screen.  
---
Could not open the map with the Dpad - had to open the pipboy, then hit the dpad.
---
Quitting the game and restarting fixed it.
---
I did the same thing, I watched the game burn and once the flames died down and it was updated I downloaded it and started playing it before the first season started and it‚Äôs pretty good now not gonna lie, I love it!!!
---
youre hoarding too much useless garbage yo
---
I wish they added new weapon levels like they did In eso
---
It‚Äôs down on PS4 currently too
---
Do you do the Daily Ops? I have to dump ammo and stims these days.
---
I‚Äôll counter this by saying :
---
Whilst the scrap box helps, it definitely doesn‚Äôt solve the issue. I may not have to worry about overfilling on junk, but now I just end up filling it with Chen‚Äôs, food, drink plans weapons and armour. I‚Äôm now up to three alt characters that are holding excess weapons and armour, coz as you said, I MIGHT need it
---
7he Guy will come claim that bounty if you a theif. Lmaoi
---
Bro I know, which stuff should I literally just throw out you think?
---
Issues with goo and ash piles include:
---
* The goo/ash piles not spawning exactly where the enemy died, probably due to desync with the server.
---
* The goo/ash piles spawning mid-air, and being unreachable.
---
* The goo/ash piles not having a bottom texture, and thus being sometimes hard to notice if it has spawned mid-air.
---
* The goo/ash piles sticking out of the ground instead of following the contours. Cosmetic and very minor.
---
* The goo/ash piles blocking other goo/ash piles and meat piles below them, and thus blocking looting.
---
* The goo/ash piles existing while empty.
---
* The goo/ash piles having no loot if they've existed for some time. Personally I'm thinking this might have to do with the meat pile creation script/mechanic; the mechanic that creates meat piles might be attempting to create a meat pile out of a goo/ash pile, which might be leading it to delete all the loot in said goo/ash pile, but the resulting meat pile is never created, and the goo/ash pile is never removed. Or, something similar might be going on.
---
Quite frankly, the entire corpse system should be looked at and improved. This includes fixing the goo/ash piles, improving the resulting meat/goo/ash piles, making sure that said piles are created more reliably, and are easier to find, and preferably creating something special for a legendary enemy. Since we're using these types of containers for corpses already, might as well make them stick out a bit more.
---
Here's an idea: instead of using a meat/goo/ash pile for a legendary enemy, spawn in a Nirnroot as the container. There's no way we couldn't find those. (It's a joke.)
---
u/Ladydevann are the developers aware of all of the above issues with the piles? I know I've reported the no loot -issue at least once or twice through the website.
---
Then.. uhh.. go to a different room!
---
1pm Eastern for daily ops reset
---
I get where you are coming from with the XP bonuses and everything, but I believe that if you are not going to join a DO in a DO group, you should probably find another group for the sake of anyone trying to join a partially formed group for their challenges.
---
It's the same as before. If you want an updated guide someone posted one about a week ago after one wastelanders update.
---
Bulk and sell, man.  I guarantee you don't need 3/4s of that crap.  Clean out that aid tab white you're at it.  Maybe make sure you've smelted all your ore and don't have ridiculous amounts of gunpowder in your miscellaneous tab, too.
---
What is an RMTER?
---
Box is full but still never have what you need.
---
Definitely going to keep an eye out for that to come around again.
---
Your gonna hate this game but if your on xbox send your gt
---
Yeah and so are the peoe who think it's bad, it's decent bordering on good.
---
We need a petition for our ultra cute kitty god to be appropriately acknowledged and immortalized in an icon for all worshippers to bear.....
---
I use the private world
---
For junk runs XD
---
Have fun with it. I just got it a few months back and its a little different from a regular modern fallout but still work it. The updates are making it better and better. The latest update really helps with leveling and letting you freely explore.
---
I could see paying *once* a day for a retry if you don't get any rare rewards, but it being like 10-15k caps
---
Ah, I'm on ps4, otherwise I'd let you know when I have a good stockpile.
---
Literally costs nothing to change your group's goal and then change it back if you want to do then again. You call it ignorant and dismissive, I call it being sensible and letting others know what you're doing.
---
No worries. Skins come and go. We got many ar-10 skins datamined but not yet released so keep an eye out. I'm waiting for that wooden ar-10
---
When are they gonna bring back the Caravan Trader Outfit... üò≠
---
Well unfortunately the steam system only allows an Up or Down vote, so there isn't a lot of nuisance with it.
---
Furthermore, the problem is that this is the straw that broke the camel's back. While I might have gotten a lot of enjoyment from the game, I'm seeing more and more things behind the atomic shop. And having played the game with and without FO1st I've been able to see the major difference.
---
Now after coming back I see that the one cosmetic I was looking forward to is behind a timed exclusive. That's the straw that breaks the back.
---
As for earning it... Well to be honest that system that you're talking about to me seems really grindy, lame, and not fun. 
---
I'd rather get the skin via a quest line, by killing an NPC boss, spending caps, or (last resort) via atoms.
---
People are after the tenderiser plan so they have a chance of getting a legendary version.
---
I get the same stability on my PS4, not that frame rate but no drops.
---
This is the way.
---
My agility is 15 from unyielding, 5 from the legendary perk, and 3 from my regular perk loadout
---
So I run around with 23 agility. I have a full set of secret service. My sneaking works just fine for me. I can go to the whitespring golf court. Sneak and kill every ghoul in there without ever going into ‚Äúdanger‚Äù same when I go in nuke silos, the only time my sneak doesn‚Äôt work is when I do daily ops (because sneak is turned off during daily ops)
---
I‚Äôm not a commando build, just a sneak bloodied unarmed/shotgun
---
The scorchebeast queen sees me because after getting 60-70 bullets in her face she figures out where I am. 
---
And the sheepsquatch imposter because fuck him and his laser attack that always gets me across the map while I‚Äôm inside the shack.
---
Yeah, pipboy light won‚Äôt let you sneak.
---
Keep only 200 of each junk in stash, scrap weapons you don't use, sell plans
---
I‚Äôm kind of disappointed with the rebalancing. I have been grinding leader of the pack forever. I would get so many 1star weapons and armor, all level 5. I would build a set and wait for someone to exit the vault, then I would set them up with it. I would also give ammo, stimpacks, radaway and food. Now I can‚Äôt because everything that drops is lvl 50
---
If your in a VATS were you keep missing I find it better to Reset the VATS.
---
Yeah, I tried it on Xbox after hearing about the shovel spawn, and nothing showed up. It could be an Xbox thing, or a ‚Äúwhat patch was that‚Äù thing, I dunno. I do carry a cursed shovel for bonking low-level scorched, so I‚Äôm good.
---
Yeah I'm not, but nice try there, i said decent build, which if your doing the ops consistantly, like he clearly is if he's complaining about a team based on them, he almost definitely has, it didn't say if your level 169 with a really strong heavy weapons build and a magic minigun i use for boss cheesing when the timer on the queen gets low.
---
Buying plans, and more recently lunchboxes. You get it by swapping your treasury notes at the machine in Crater or Foundation.
---
I'm on the verge of being crippled by the weight of crap I'm carrying right now. 488 radaway, 368 orange mentats, only 177 stimpaks because I just sold a couple hundred... you get the idea. 
---
I need these vendors to reset way more often and for the cap limit to be gone. I can't get rid of this stuff fast enough.
---
I imagine you could put "external" images (like wallpapers and stuff) with the same size and a similar name in the photomode folder and the game would use them as loading screens?
---
Yeah I'm not, but nice try there, i said decent build, which if your doing the ops consistantly, like he clearly is if he's complaining about a team based on them, he almost definitely has, it didn't say if your level 169 with a really strong heavy weapons build and a magic mini-gun i use for boss cheesing when the timer on the queen gets low.
---
The butt of a weapon is considered a melee weapon. The barrel of a weapon is not. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
This is what I‚Äôm trying to say. I‚Äôd love to build here and be creative, but I‚Äôm going to lose all my progress and materials. Not sure why people care so much about the little amount of material you get out of them. I easily maintain a healthy balance of all of it (that at least I need) while doing all my Daily stuff. 
---
If they‚Äôre not going to serve a greater roll, just let us build there. Maybe the removal of workshops will allow a wider build radius to, to cover the old workshop zones just a thought man ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yeah, and that's the annoying part to me is having to keep an eye out for it. I've got a lot of other stuff going on in life that you gotta keep your eye on. Would be way simpler if they just kept all their items on the store and allowed you to get them when you can get them, not by using this psychological gimmick.
---
anything over 75-100 of any junk item that isnt exceedingly rare like ballistic fiber or things you craft/repair with often.. you dont need 500 glass
---
ammo you dont use.. especially heavy ammo like missiles
---
legendary gear that you dont use or isnt selling in your vendor.. lower the prices drastically or scrip it
---
check your misc tab.. people often over look gunpowder and unsmelted ores as a source of weight problems..
---
sort stash tabs by weight to see what heavy items you have the most of and jettison all that you can
---
Maybe the altered perception of mobs in one wasteland balancing. Remember that mobs levels most likely went up for any given location.  No longer sneaking against lvl 50 super mutants. Lvl 100 were bound to have better stats. 
---
Pip boy light absolutely hurts stealth big time.
---
Yes. Entitlement. Because you didn't get an earned timed item. 
---
Especially because if you bought on steam, means you likely would have been in the time frame to be able to earn or buy and you just weren't paying attention. 
---
So you make a choice not to do something and then blame the game. There's a million valid reasons to have issues. This isn't one. 
---
It's not bootlicking when you're just an idiot.
---
It‚Äôs used to purchase things from Raiders, Settlers, Secret Service, and Enclave.
---
Events and daily‚Äôs give treasury notes. Notes can be turned in for gold bullion. Bullion can be saved to buy newer plans. 
---
You can only turn in 20 treasury notes a day
---
You can only hold 5000 gold. 
---
Gold machines are at foundation and crater. 
---
Gold plans are at foundation, crater, and vault 79.
---
Yeah I'm not comparing my skill to anybody, but nice try there, i said decent build, which if your doing the ops consistantly, like he clearly is if he's complaining about a team based on them, he almost definitely has, I didn't say if your level 169 with a really strong heavy weapons build and a magic mini-gun i use for boss cheesing when the timer on the queen gets low.
---
I also am showing 0 atoms and I had close to 3000 when I logged off yesterday. I hope I get them back when the atom shop is back.
---
Tbh nothing surprises with this game üòÇ
---
200 is way more than needed for the vast majority of junk items
---
Oh I'm sorry this is a laser rifle. I'll change the original post. Thank your for the input though, so sorry I didn't clarify better!
---
You ever used a bow? Thats worse then Guass Shotgun/Rifle. Never using Mingun or Pistol tho.
---
Understandable, I just ran an extra one for kicks with 1 other player and we finished in 7:20 no problem.
---
I think the issue with the mode is that it directly calls out Bloodied VATS snipers because they're all in closed quarters and sometimes require melee to finish off enemies. I saw some ranged builds bashing baddies yesterday and good on 'em, but a lot of players who have gotten used to mashing Q+M1 for instant victory are at a loss with the recent update.
---
Meanwhile, me who was running around with melee weapons slamming stims day one 2 years ago am having a blast.
---
Slightly less of a blast when we miss the 8 minute mark by seconds after I'm up in the boss' face saying I didn't hear no bell and ranged scaredies didn't even rush the objective.
---
It is harder for melee builds to solo Uplink since you can't stay in the objective area constantly.
---
I nuke workshops then take them back over if they‚Äôre running ass/sent, Quantums, Tesla and using a stealth boy. It forces them into something I can kill them in easier, and significantly reduces their ability to take damage.
---
Literally costs nothing to be patient. The sheer number of times I have joined an Ops team, only to run a SINGLE Op &amp; then have to change groups because of people doing this exact thing is insane. Yeah, I wanna play the game too. And I can absolutely do that while waiting for people who want to run Ops. If that means that each time I run an Op i have a new team, fine. But if my day is going to be dedicated to running Ops, I'm staying on the Ops team. If the goal changes, I'm leaving. But when we run a Daily Op, people need downtime for food, smoke break, etc etc and that means waiting 20-30 minutes between Ops so that other people can do that.
---
It also costs literally nothing to have compassion for your casual gamers who wanna run a few Ops a day and still enjoy the rest of the game.
---
It‚Äôs currency to use with the three new factions, raiders settlers and secret service,  you get special legendary weapons and armor as well as some camp items (one in particular is very useful) you earn it by doing certain events (I‚Äôm not exactly sure which ones) but you won‚Äôt start earning them till you complete the main story with of the two factions,raiders or settlers
---
Sometimes you‚Äôll find other people that are just trying to get their daily score challenges done, completely ignoring you
---
Yes please. I think it'd be cool if we could build TVs with different channels like the radio.
---
Go Into atomic shop then back out then check Map,that worked for me
---
Scrap box solves your issues for about a month. Then you are asking yourself which of these awesome useful 1 stars do I drop to the ground to free up a few pounds.
---
Awesome! Im on PC but I bet people on ps4 would love to welcome you there. Have fun!
---
I like both of these things. Toilet roll will go in my scrapbox or vendor, and toxic goo helps push my rads down.
---
Explosive I got anti armor. It is weaker than normal but I one shot most things...super nice
---
I didn't know that you can "earn" a timed exclusive in a video game. 
---
That's just 'idiotic' thinking that comes from people that have bought the microtransaction scheme hook line and sinker.
---
Complete the main story siding with raiders/foundation you will get 500- after finishing that story you get treasury notes as rewards for dailies,you can trade them for bullion, bullion is I used to buy rare plans and rewards.
---
Typically magic weapons mainly work on Shotguns and Heavy guns 
---
For Shotguns if you have a magic effect you need to only use VATS to get the full effect of the trigger. 
---
For Heavy Guns you need to have a Fire Rate of over 200 to trigger the magic effect, explosive effect adds a double Fire Rate feature so if you FR was 102 it turn to 204 with explosive evenif it doesn't show. (Gauss Minigun is the exception since it has explosive by default)
---
If you an armor piece (just 1 piece) with Reduce Damage by Blocking as a 3rd Minor modifier you will get magic effect on all weapons, but will only notice it on Shotguns and Heavy Guns.
---
Not a train wreck. Welcome. An awesome community happy to have you
---
1st is really pretty handy, I use the private world to run workshops undisturbed or grab a Nuclear keycard when I need one because the public servers always seem to be on cooldown when I look lol, also I wouldn‚Äôt be without my survival tent now, need to offload junk.... drop the tent, need a quick nap for xp bonus.... drop,the tent, need to quickly cook so,etching for the food buff it gives..... you get the idea, also pretty useful to stand on during prime cuts event in the ash heap to dodge those cave crickets and radscorpions, oh and nearly forgot the atoms, they‚Äôre always useful now we don‚Äôt have atom challenges so I use it all
---
So you're now trying to turn this into an attack against microtransactions when your first post said you'd pay atoms.
---
Plus yes, if you actually played the game at all, you'd know there's many ways to "earn" atoms by playing the game. 
---
Lol. Gtfoh.
---
That'd be really cool, a tesla orb that can stick to surfaces/enemies and constantly arcs for a few seconds.   Tons of fun.  Maybe that could be a barrell mod for a possible Tesla canon heavy weapon. Plz BoS, bring this item
---
I'd rather not sit around for 10 minutes for a full bond only to get in there and find out two of the four can't follow a goddamn waypoint. Run them from the start, stick together and run it a few times. If you get Elder on the first try, that's fine, can still farm ammo and xp.
---
You have to complete the wastelanders main quest to be able to start earning treasury notes from events. 20 treasury notes can be redeemed at the gold bullion machines every 20 hours. Gold bullion can be spent at 3 different vendors for various armor pieces, weapons, mods, etc. Some items require a certain reputation with either settlers or raiders. Settlers main weapon is a gauss shotgun at maximum rep (ally) and raiders main weapon is a gauss Minigun at maximum rep (ally). Both are possible, but can be an extreme grind of multiple weeks/months.
---
Have 100 or less of each junk item. Don't hoard weapons, scrip isn't all that special. Try not to store food. I have just about any junk I'll need and rarely go over 620-640. Also keep track of what junk items you actually need, it's probably not a great idea to have 100+ asbestos, crystal, silver, gold or fiberglass
---
If it's a Rifle just add the Splitter to turn it to a shotgun, that can help with damage and may even turn "magic" if you have the right armor effect
---
As far as i know, yes.  I ran a tesla the other day in ACP for the ads and had no issue
---
Legacy Explosive energy guns still pack a mean punch, try doing that with a non-legacy
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts.
---
Woah no way dude!  So sick
---
Do you know if you gotta use the handheld camera or does photo mode work too?
---
What do we need another gauss rifle for, exactly? Or is there something I'm missing about this one?
---
That did it. Thank you
---
I mean, you could also just be patient with people. Message them or something. Most people probably just forgot or were waiting for others and got bored so they did a quick mission. Shit happens dude it's not the end of the world. People can forget things they are only human. People aren't robots made to to daily ops with you right when you wanna do them.
---
I usually take care of everything that I need to do, then I start my own Ops team. Do it and then leave the team.
---
It's gold that's been smelted into a more convenient and measurable shape.
---
Using hacked or bugged weapons doesn't really require much effort. And they have nothing to do with legit gameplay and the damage calculation changes.
---
Yes, I know how the perk works. How MUCH time does it save? 
---
My last silo run was like 30 minutes at a pretty casual pace and the ammo usage was negligible. If a silo run still takes 15 minutes using master infiltrator lvl 4, then it's not worth the perk coins(to me). If it takes 5 minutes, then it might be.
---
Trap base huh? What makes people think that a trap base is cool? I report every trap base i find and yes people are getting banned for trap bases and i love getting hate messages from friends of the people ive reported, lol. Trap bases are for little bitches.
---
Double post, delete one
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is for people who join your team that you started with Daily Ops in mind. If that‚Äôs the case, I understand. 
---
Because if you‚Äôre calling out people who are in a Daily Ops team that you joined as you enter a new server that‚Äôs just ignorant.
---
Lol. Anyone can do that with the legacy bloodied explosive Gatling plasma they are using. Big woooooopidy doooooo
---
I love Fallout 76. Not played 3 or Los Vegas but I loved Fallout4. Strong was my companion ü•∞. I quite wish there was a similar option in 76
---
The only thing I have in my stash is legendaries and plans and it‚Äôs still full. Scrap box doesn‚Äôt solve anything, it just pushes the problem a little further down the road
---
They might have accidentally hit something and got knocked off. 
---
It happens to be sometimes when setting up my afk.
---
Awesome guys thanks for all the help!!, now one last thing, can you side with both? If not which side is more beneficial? And how do u start the secret service?
---
I randomly travel to the random players that are level 10 or below and drop off purified water, food, and any other random things I have to aid them.  Sometimes weapons and ammo, but usually just 10 or so stimpaks, food and water.  
---
It's always interesting, because I do it in power armor with my .50 cal machine gun.  Sometimes they run scared, sometimes they just look at me like I'm an idiot. Lol
---
Learn to manage scrap. Most of it you WILL NOT need.
---
I'm in the same boat as you my guy the best tip I can give you is add the search icon to the junk you use most and mainly pick that up. Also gears copper gold silver oil can go for a decent amount of caps.
---
Ooh I've seen this happen to people before. This is a weird one to solve cause people have tried to drop all cores and put them back in inventory but sometimes it doesn't work. Maybe give it a shot
---
Yet you can discreetly light things on fire with a flamethrower undetected.
---
stop pretending it's not you, SH.
---
You brought up the idea of a "earning" a timed exclusive via a microtransaction paywall. That type of microtransaction, in my opinion, is dumb. I suppose I could further elaborate my initial post into a multi page TLDR on my specific thoughts, but I'd rather not.
---
And I never said that there isn't a way of getting Atoms in game. However, if you played the game, then you would know that the rate of gaining atoms is very slow as the game progresses (with an initial boost near the beginning of the game in order to give a fall sense of the speed of attainment).
---
And seeing how this is my thread, I don't think I'll gtfoh :)
---
oii not bad
---
Welcome to the fray baby! Bout to get buckwild woooo!
---
Oh I don‚Äôt know haven‚Äôt unlocked it yet.
---
It‚Äôs worth it to me for looting also though not having to bother with the lock pick mini game
---
For me atleast, I mainly run out of adhesive, steel and screws. Other 200 stay in their max
---
Different character won‚Äôt have the levels unlocked.
---
Lol k kid. Stay or go. Doesn't matter to me. 
---
Obviously the rest of the community agrees as 90% of people are just telling you you're wrong and downvoting. 
---
Some people are into public humiliation, I'm not here to kinkshame.
---
So what are your tips to win?
---
I don't think it really matters if one considers a legacy weapon to be legit gameplay, he still pulled it off. =D Also the last record holders were only able to get their feats by abusing a glitch with Revenant.
---
That‚Äôs the thing though... you are writing a review for a product you said you aren‚Äôt purchasing (that skin)
---
Yesterday I server hopped for about 2 and a half hours before I found the team that actually joined daily ops.
---
When I'm done farming Brotherhood spec ops outfit (I've already got the mask), I'm also done with this very entertaining game mode. No thanks.
---
Yaes bb
---
I'll take a mosin nagant. Please and thank you.
---
I can relate, after you mentioned this .I recall a few days ago.  I had just that happen. I hung in there and eventually it finished itself.
---
But have they actually said they would be places that we have visited in previous fallout titles? I know they are outside of Appalachia but I haven‚Äôt read anything about going to former locations. Unless I missed something.
---
it's also down in europe on ps4
---
FYI you quad posted xD
---
i can only start it once tho, only have the one key
---
Class freak is bullshit. It doesn‚Äôt work properly and if I‚Äôm gonna fight someone important or difficult I‚Äôll pop a set of serums first.
---
Are the rewards character or account?
---
Damn, i ran out of mine. Well, just let me know if you need help
---
Holy crap Lol. My internet bugged out right as I posted it. Didnt notice that xD good looks
---
lol, it can be done with 3 magazines of bugged lmg, like in 20 seconds
---
Im saying add it back in and make it give the 44 more damage
---
Seems that you're getting a bit emotional here (a sure sign when someone throws out the "kid" insult).
---
As for the community agreeing or disagreeing with me, I'll point at the larger FO community that's by in large downvoted/reviewed FO76 as the worse FO since tactics.
---
I nutted while reading this.
---
Fucking WHAT.
---
Can we buy lunch boxes with gold yet?
---
Never heard them say anything, now I will pay more attention o3o
---
Isn‚Äôt it weird when virgins use phrases like, ‚Äúballs deep‚Äù?
---
You can try to place something by the tree to make it disappear
---
They decided to combine fractured steel and the other bos content into one and it's not coming out until 2021.
---
This is exactly why I always start my own Daily Ops team, so I can kick inactive players off the team.
---
If you unlock it once on any account you can use it everywhere
---
Don‚Äôt tell them, Bethe! I need that sneak damage üòÇ
---
**Edit: We've resolved the issue and the Atomic Shop is back online. Thanks for your patience!**
---
Hi, thanks for the report. We're investigating an issue that's causing the Atomic Shop to appear offline at the moment. I have a thread up here that we'll update once the Shop is available again: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/429994/
---
Right, but I'm not acting like I'm some sort of saint. I came here to post a simple complaint, which I did so politely and without sabre rattling. Hell, I didn't even use a click bait title.
---
And the response has been rather interesting, seemingly pointing to a very defensive fanbase (no offense intended).
---
Not maxed out ammo factory yet
---
Character I mean
---
in general, i keep 100 of everything beside of what i need to craft ammo (steel, lead, acid, cloth).  
---
make sure not to hoard too much flux, that stuff is way too heavy. i make ult ammo out of it and put it in my vendor. lot of junk sells extremly fast, like aluminum and oil. bulk it and put it in your vendor. there are people paying 4 caps for a single screw. take that money and go vendor hopping.   
---
also, i got bandolier rank 2 and carry like 75k of ammo with me, consider that.  
---
stuff that doesnt sell fast (in my experience concrete, copper, crystal,...) i simply dump til i got 100 left, wont use this ever.
---
Down in Japan too
---
usually place place a tree from the atom shop i got from one of the bundles over the tree that clips through my walls. But anything else works too.
---
Down for me in the Eastern US
---
If it's the usual merge glitch it's pretty simple 
---
Just put the mirror ball on top of the tv, then grab the t.v. and carry it around the ground in your camp (has to be on dirt or a natural surface, not indoors)
---
Basically keep dragging it around til you notice a spot where the tv kinda sinks into the ground, but is still placeable 
---
Place it there and then pick it up again
---
Doing this over and over will slowly sink the mirror ball into the tv 
---
Maybe doing it in just the right spot does what you're taking about?
---
Not sure, but from what you were explaining, it sounds like the merge glitch is involved
---

Yes, UK PS4 atom shop currently offline..
---
Ahh, thats a handy website! Cheers.
---
I've noticed a lot more afk players lately. 
---
I was doing primal cuts yesterday for the xp and notes. There was the same guy at every event, just standing there. And for some reason, everyone would sit there and defend him.
---
Best I can do is 1 cap or I kill your brahamn
---
You must be the chosen one
---
I'm starting to think a tank build is what I'm going to need.
---
Wait that sucks, why did they do that?
---
I try to do this, sometimes waiting for some other players to join, especially if the meat Cook event is on.
---
However, have had multiple occasions the last week where I cant change to a casual team afterwards because "I am already in a team".
---
You are ATOM!!
---
I know?! Almost 2 years now and I never noticed. Read here: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mole\_miner](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mole_miner)
---
Yeah. My I2515r lmg is no slouch against earl
---
doesn't work with larger trees, sadly
---
I've been wary of this. I'm not the newest player, but I'm still working on builds. Been playing since it went free on the gamepass, a bit gutted I never picked it up before to be honest. But I guess all the negative stigma put me off.
---
Outside of Morgantown is beautiful country.
---
Well if you run that build with a vampire weapon you are plenty tanky haha, a vamp mini gun/50cal/gat laser/flamer and you're pretty much immortal
---
Why have I never heard of this guy before... its a goldmine for information.
---
They still drop the plan, but its very rare.
---
Probably so they have more time to polish it. Not sure exactly what's coming in the next patch in October.
---

---
It's for season 3 and that doesn't start untill mid December at the earliest.
---
I agree with all your points, especially the power plants. But I still think they could be much better. Why put caps on everything? If you hold the ammo workshop for example, ammo caps at 200 rounds, junk and lead cap at 20. I would be much more inclined to take them if I could check them once a play though, instead of every hour to not waste resources due to the cap.
---
I maxed it out on the first day and made like 2500 cores, it was great.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt actually say anything but just mumble. Where did you find this info?
---
It appears in rare.
---
I was making suggestions of how i think it **should** be, not how it currently is. I apologize for the confusion.
---
What do you mean by armor effect? So you think the AA laser rifle will be better than the TS Ultracite Laser rifle?
---
The time it takes to do a daily op is enough time to max out the bond so there‚Äôs no reason for people to be waiting for that
---
Good luck, extremely rare. I‚Äôm level 225, killed probably close to 150 SBQ‚Äôs and haven‚Äôt gotten it. Not sure about regular scorchbeasts.
---
Feel free to ask the subreddit for help. It‚Äôs probably one of the more wholesome communities i‚Äôve seen. In game and out.  
---
The hate train, public relation wise was warranted. But i‚Äôve always felt the game deserved better. It just suffers from Bethesda public relations mishaps.
---
Oh! And welcome to our little slice of heaven, hope you enjoy it! ;)
---
Luckily, I just picked up my first vamp ranged weapon this week. Its only a submachine gun, but i suppose I could tweak it to use rifles.

---
If fun to create something that is engineered good enough to actually trap a player. Players are smart so yeah there is joy in watching what you created work.
---
And the traps you are most likely getting banned are ones that use some form a glitch. People do not get banned for using non glitched traps.
---
If you say so buttercup, I find them quite entertaining.
---
To add to this traps also fit right into the fallout. All the fallouts the raiders would utilize traps to kill you the player therefore being mad at a player for using them is just silly. What wasteland would not have traps.
---
Because it is constantly going on, each time I press for the menu it brings up the scoreboard.
---
I want the menu, not the scoreboard.
---
The creation club in 4 had an awesome wall display bobblehead stand. They've shared creation club content before so why not use the assets.
---
Welp that's it for me... No more Uranium Fever.
---
My first experience with the FO76 Community a few weeks back was a high level player wave to me as I was leaving the vault then proceed to give me a rifle, ammo, food and water then offer to help me quest.
---
Fingers crossed everyone else is as cool, I will endeavour to be myself
---
It's a horribly annoying known bug. Current workaround is to go onto the scoreboard on your home screen, when you back out you should see it go from lvl 1 up to your current level
---
Rare
---
I‚Äôm annoyed having to wait for the Daily Ops and teams popups to disappear so I can only imagine the joy of having to wait for 30+ levels to progress before being able to access the map.
---
They do. It's in the Wiki: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mole\_miner](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mole_miner)
---
They‚Äôre legacies. They‚Äôre insanely powerful. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt drop anymore. If you‚Äôre just gonna use them as display fodder, that‚Äôs on you. And as for not liking people that PvP with them, what‚Äôs your view on putting 30 rounds into someone and have their health bar not move an inch because they‚Äôre Quantum spamming? Or spamming super stims? Both are effective against ballistic weapons, and renders them useless, especially with ass/sent armor. Legacies, especially post nerf, and melee are the only ways to push through the damage reduction, resistance and healing they can throw up. Melee is only any good if you can get close enough to hit them, then reliably hit them. If it‚Äôs gotten to the point you need to deal 1200+ actual damage in order to deal 110 effective damage (effective damage is damage after damage reduction, and resistance), then that just goes to show you that defence and healing is unbalanced. I will let you shoot me all day with a BE handmade. Hell, I‚Äôll even let you borrow mine! I‚Äôll use my PvP setup and show you *just* how weak ballistic weapons are. Then I‚Äôll let you borrow my BE laser to show you that‚Äôs what it takes to push through all that shit.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll keep that in mind! Hate it how the game doesn‚Äôt tell you that, but this helped me out.
---
Yeah sometimes it won't though. I usually wait a bit just to see if it'll catch up or not before I leave
---
Seems to be down worldwide across all platforms :(
---
Help, I can't see shit and it won't go away xD
---
It drops from SBQ at 0.081% and from Scorchbeasts at 0.0081% chance. The only 2 options currently. You could always buy them from a Player Vendor or a certain subreddit that for some stupid reason can't be mentioned here...
---
Correct. I should be more clear next time.
---
If you go unyielding you can use the plasma caster as a vats weapon, its very ammo efficient
---
If it's higher up in the Fire Rate, like 170's, it might proc on occasion. But 200 will always have consistent magic.
---
I like the idea, especially for those that aren‚Äôt daily players. I wouldn‚Äôt do it because I hate that gap between season end and new season. I feel so lost..
---
PvP is the worst in this game. I don‚Äôt understand why people continue to beat that dead horse when there are plenty of better PvP games out there they could play.
---
The fact that you need massively broken explosive energy weapons to even compete in FO76 PvP is a great indication that it‚Äôs a useless mode.
---
I bet you would, dirty swingers...üòâ
---
I've found you can remove the unwanted wall pieces after building up to the roof
---
So you can still build like before,it's just more annoying
---
lol I mean...I killed probably a hundred of the passive Treasure Hunter ones...now I feel like a complete monster.
---
Had this problem this morning and ended up giving up. My 3 teammates were sitting in the camps. One even emoted thumbs down when I ported into DO and emoted ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù. I can only play on weekends and even then It‚Äôs for a small amount of time so I‚Äôll probably end up practicing doing it solo.
---
It wasn‚Äôt me who supplied him. Everyone I supplied was given solid advice on how to use their guns and armor.
---
If you are going heavy gunner you almost have to go power armor. Stabilized is too good.
---
There is a passive mode? How do I turn it on? 
---
 (Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm quite new!)
---
I was also torn between switching my melee to a  heavy gunner. But I decided to make an alt for heavy, and I have to say heavy guns with PA is really fun to use
---
That's what I was worried about. The minigun is ok, but definitely could be better.
---
I wouldn't say get rid of them completely, more so let us treat them as if we have another camp to load in after taking them. I agree with the lack of resource output, but I'd still like to make a home away from home. I'd be interesting to see the type of workshops players would make.
---
That's what everyone has been saying about you behind your back...
---
You can only side with one, but you get faction reputation for both. Whichever one you side with, you‚Äôll get a decent reputation bump for them. Secret Service is available after wastelanders is complete, no rep required.
---
For standard day to day PvP, because of my build I can use a bog standard handmade or Fixer and kill most average players. Hell, I can even kill good ones. But it‚Äôs the top tier of PvP where you need legacies and what not to push through their defences. Done right, power armor can offer substantial protection, even against legacies.
---
Do you like it better than melee? I have a bloodied sneaky sniper as my main and has great. Melee was my something different and it rocked.
---
Also, making accounts to promote your own crappy videos \* slow clap \*
---
Thank you sir. I promise I won‚Äôt troll.
---
Legacy weapons aren't broken, they are just legacy. =D
---
The fastest way to finish the event are the drums and spits - 6 players will give you a huge head start and the entire event may only last 1 minute if people are doing everything correctly.
---
They should display the Pint Size Slasher gameplay from Fallout 3.
---
You sound salty sir :(
---
Cheers for the response
---
I'll have to start then.  I just hit level 50 and haven't felt up to it.
---
They're awfully angry, aren't they?
---
I know the devs said they'd like to expand on Mole Miner lore eventually.
---
I will say, though, a lot of the dialogue in this game is jarring for me. Given the futuristic 50s culture the world had when everything went to hell, I always feel like it should have more 40s-50s type dialogue, but the voice acting feels like a bunch of YouTubers swearing at each other and it kills immersion sometimes.
---
I just wish Bethesda would lean more into that retro-futuristic style. New Vegas did it so well with Old World Blues.
---
Stop crying dude, sometimes I take time to get shit together before an op. I never run solo, seems to work fine for me. Maybe make some friends to play with instead of going to random groups hoping for success
---
Yeah, armor ignore is very good.... its assume they stuck heavy guns with making that decision. That said for bloodied build emergency protocols is pretty awesome.
---
I love my melee build, been rocking it since beta. But after one wasteland I‚Äôm enjoying my heavy gunner more
---
you want a magic shotgun.
---
Sort of. To get the best outcome do the quest for both until you get to a quest where you will get a prompt that siding with one will end quests for the other so you can maximize your rep. Once you get to the end of the quest, your final decision can raise rep for both, raise rep for one and lower rep for one or lower rep for both.
---
This is exactly why I disagree with everyone saying "not everyone is always ready to go, sometimes we forget etc" it's just not a valid answer. Some people have limited time to play and for people to just not change the group goal because they forgot or "can't be bothered" is just toxic behaviour.
---
theres never been a recipe for psychotats, sorry.
---
Yes, I had about 1200 atoms and it was at zero. What gives?
---
Like a real rifle not a cannon. Something that can go full auto
---
The shop is also down, so hopefully they get returned.
---
Can confirm‚Äîgoing to the scoreboard on the home screen seem to fix it. And it only gets more annoying the higher your rank‚ÄîI was in the mid-90s last season when it happened‚Äîtoo forever to cycle through the ranks...
---
Maybe enclave officer uniform? I haven‚Äôt tried it yet myself.
---
Most people now at rank 35 and higher you should play more
---
I was at 2300 and now I'm at 0
---
Also, changing the subject because I proved you wrong. :( \* pity clap \*
---
Why sit in a group before you've got your shit ready though? Some people can't play all the time and only get a few hours, and people just sitting around in a group wastes everyone's time.
---
I always hunt down bounties;)
---
üòÇü§£
---
Ah, gotcha. If they don‚Äôt then I‚Äôll have to write to Bethesda.
---
I also hate it when the lack of a single item means I can't use CAMP's "repair all". It should allow repairing everything that you have resources for. 
---
I had a single carrot planted and lost it in the high grass.  When it broke, I had to search all Wasteland for a spare carrot,  or repair everything else one by one.
---
Yea. It runs over and over in a no. Stop loop sometimes. Starting back all the way at zero. I‚Äôm not very far in (level 26 on the scoreboard) and it will run through two or three times in a row. So annoying.
---
Stop. Relying. On. Randoms.
---
This has to be a known issue then?
---
I'm confused, how did you end up stuck, and how did they know to bring it to you?
---
How exactly did you prove me wrong?
---
Yeah but I should be able to finish it
---
Fantastic suggestions
---
Then it won't be played like pvp in adventure
---
I would hope so but knowing Bethesda and this games record, who knows
---
I'm on ps4 and if you ever need stimpacks I have plenty to give. My psn is the same as you see here if you need it.
---
When I stopped playing because it became stale and lacking anything proper new.
---
First I had the Escape Artist icon, the one with the Scorched and the question mark. Then I switched to the rainbow icon when that came out for last year's pride month. Guess I've been using it ever since, though I switched to the Platinum icon the other day because she kinda looks like my character.
---
Has anyone see if there is a armor ace outfit like in the artwork?
---
Maybe. The ball places fine in the tv, but can‚Äôt figure it out. I‚Äôll try merging and see if that works. Thanks
---
That's how 76 was marketed. Sorry mate.
---
Yea I‚Äôm not sure what happened in their game but I‚Äôm level 44 and have no issues with these things. I maybe do one ops a week. I had to refuse radaway from a higher level because I had 180 stashed away. I gave all my super stems to a new player yesterday; I have an over abundance of health items.
---
Valid point.
---
Thanks. That sounds correct. I knew I wasn't seeing it three times for every two levels certainly which is why I knew the ~15k/level was quite off.
---
Nope never has been.
---
Some is if don't have dedicated groups to play with. We just want to log on, play the daily ops without waiting for half an hour to find others, do what we wanna do and leave. I don't want to make commitments to a permeant team that I might not be able to uphold.
---
It‚Äôs called maintenance. Not a bug, lots of posts already too
---
Okay workshop build üî®üè†
---
When I could still play the game to relieve my stress before this new update ruined it for me üòä
---
I dont think you have to do the merge glitch with this one. I had two tvs at my camp and my buddy just placed the mirror balls right inside of my tvs without moving them.
---
Okay, my rebuttle to that is this, they could have been doing literally anything before hand, finished up, and decided to hop in to try to help.
---
Did you check the other attachments? Everything affects ap cost
---
Heavy guns need PA, firstly stabilized is Very good, heavy guns don't benefit from unyelding because the bonus agility, perception and luck is wasted since your not sneaking or vats, you can do it but it's not effective something like rifles. You can try bolstering but still won't be as tanky as PA because of the Hidden damage reduction
---
I like the idea of unique mobs in each silo - a nice bit of variety. But I want the silo run over ASAP so I can get on with the SBQ or Earl fight!
---
Yesterday I got 6 sheepsquatch meat from one in primal cuts in the ash heap, but I didn‚Äôt know that was weird so I didn‚Äôt take a screenshot. He also had 2 legendaries
---
It‚Äôs actually been happening pretty regularly for me during prime meat events, but prior to that never.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been noticing that 3rd person crouching zoom sensitivity.
---
I think in part is because if they beef them up to make them more desirable, then two things happen:
---
* even more complaints come in on how 1st is pay to win since people can take workshops uncontested.
---
* people on public server start getting into more PvP situations, which leads to more complaints from people who want the supplies but don‚Äôt want PVP.
---
Personally, as someone who has 1st, I‚Äôd rather they stay as they are, rather than they be lost like we lost Foundation
---
Or just unlock the HUD and allow us to arrange it as we see fit and hide what we don't need.
---
I went with deep pockets on all limbs for my 1st mod, then buttressed as my 2nd mod. For my chest I did asbestos I think? and forget what else.
---
I just started on the SS armor, so after over 40 rolls I finally got 1 good left leg... now to do the other pieces. It's a long process LOL.
---
I'm a bloodied sneak, so im trying to roll all unyielding and one chameleon piece, then mod with the above couple mods.
---
But, kinda like you mentioned, I dont care about the jetpack, and I already got both faction backpacks... so what else do I spend it on?
---
At this point I'm just waiting until I get close to 5000 gold, then buy literally anything with it so I don't let the notes build up too much. I guess I could always just save the notes and max the gold for future content.
---
Thats a fantastic idea
---
Can you get them off regular scortched beast. ?
---
Aye thanks lad. If you have any more idea please let me know
---
Last night there was a pvp war at whitesprings and the roof of the station was so littered in chains it looked like a snowy rooftop.
---
I have wayyyyy back in the day during the XB1 beta, but yeah it's just a glitch with the meat cook event.
---
That just says that 
---
* Expeditions
---
* New Daily OPs
---
* PLM
---
have been moved to 2021, just as I remember it.
---
With Season 3, New Armor and weapons for winter. So there still might be a chance to see that for Xmas :)
---
Ah. Nice I can't fast travel
---
The community, and was the game play but my play style has to change after update.  Worst part is the rng the drop rates are terrible and timegating too.
---
figured it may have been meat related
---
Good initiative!
---
Never looked up their dialogue before. That quote about the blue suits is interesting, could be referring to us 76ers or it could be referencing the vault in the ash heap.
---
I can't wait for an update that focuses on them, there's so much they can do with them, especially since their tunnels seem to be spread all over Appalachia.
---
It is your fault. Just server hop till you find a team you can join that‚Äôs not a daily op team. You do realize the mutations and perks you listed are for teams, right? It‚Äôs up to you to find a team if you want the boon.
---
Bloodied/sneak here...
---
I've go an explosive handmade I use sometimes, no issues.
---
Also an bloodied explosive 10mm I use for tagging mobs in large events. It's good enough to cause mass damage to lots of stuff in the area, but doesnt make a mess, also it doesnt kill with one shot, so everyone else can get a chance to hit stuff too (like uranium fever)
---
If I duck and go hidden, I can shoot all the mole miners in that event once, and when they come out to find people they still often run right by me... not always, but often enough that I believe the sneak is still working fine.
---
Heavy guns non PA/ full health/ high resistance build here. I left my data:

---
No i did not as they have nothing to do with this discussion. We are talking about magazines and their effects on vats cost. Not how low you can go with fully modified weapon.
---
The most versatile build in the game is heavy weapons, your getting good defense, strong weapons with easy to craft ammo, and you get to walk around in a giant war robot suit
---
What if you joined a DO team that JUST finished an Op? This situation could be so easily fixed if we had text chat.
---
This. 
---
Plus you can just fast travel out of them so...
---
This goes for Earle too üò°
---
Cool glitch lol
---
Ya thats not a 100%, i was in a full group, progress bar stopped, 1 left and 3 of us stayed, had the 3x for over 5mins never advanced.
---
Interesting, I've had little success with hallucigen in the past and don't think I even tried testing it on people since wastelanders came out
---
Paranoia isn't a good trait to have sir :(
---
I'll tell him that \^\_\^
---
Feel free to add me and my fiance we are more than happy to help your through the wasteland!

I saved it as it looks so good.

I'll tell him you said that \^\_\^ &lt;3
---
Full auto Gauss rifle? I am interested.
---
It works fine. It is a visual bug in the effects page, and if you un equip and re equip it the bug stops. Way easier than popping a bunch of serums
---
If I'm being honest I'm still having more fun with these than almost anything else in the game,but that might be my 4k cryo cells I farmed yesterday talking lol.
---

---
It‚Äôs ironic that you mentioned straw men a while ago, as ‚Äòprove that PVP was popular at inception,‚Äô is a great example of one. I thought that maybe it was a claim I inadvertently made, but re-read my posts and no, it‚Äôs not in there. 
---
Talk about straw men. Your lack of self awareness is painful.
---
I'm the one stating that pvp wasn't ever popular at inception. I never said that you said that. 
---
It's called establishing a baseline. I'm saying the baseline for pvp was very low to begin with. The fact that it went lower, something we both agree on, is irrelevant. It was always low. 
---
It bothers me that this very basic principle is lost on you.
---
You know what I'm going to stop here. It really feels like that I'm punching down now.
---
But really take your time, enjoy the content. 
---
Even when you can fast travel, enjoy the walk instead Sometimes you stumble on to things you'd never see otherwise.  Stories an missions otherwise missed. 
---
Don't grind, enjoy. And have fun!
---
Lol no thanks I'll do what I want
---
*starts cult*
---
All your game data is stored via the cloud. You should be fine.
---
Lol people are so lame
---
Well a legacy weapon is not a hacked or a bugged weapon. It is a legacy weapon. \^\_\^ Yes it needs a damage recalculation but to class it as a hacked or bugged weapon just makes you look like a big dummy dumb. \^\_\^
---
I remember throwing SOOOOOO many legendaries on the ground at launch. If I still had even a fraction of those, I'd be a rich kingpin right now.
---
Now I grab everything, study the stats and flip most of it.
---
You don't know what you don't know. Good for you for helping them out!
---
Thus you realized that and tried to change the subject \^\_\^
---
For me as long as they are on the objective I dont care what they do. If they don't touch the objective I boot them right before we kill the boss.
---
Heh, I'll admit I'm a level 200 something that sucks at it. I do not have weapons taht will kill quickly. I haven't built my build to be efficient, just to be how I find fun to play the game. And it takes away my biggest advantage and way of playing, stealth. Honestly I only even do them to get the score. So yeah, I admit I'm looking for some one to carry but my level might fool some one into thinking I can carry them (I can't). 
---
But I find in general level 300-400's are usually pretty good at it. So that's who I look for. I find my best groups are the ones that I'm in already with a casual group and some one just decides to go do it. I find if they're willing to do it in a casual group they don't need others so I can usually come in and it won't be so bad. I do try to contribute but usually these people are killing mobs so quick I barely do much at all. It's not like I try to hide and have them do all the work, it's just I suck so much the most help I am is a body to make the timer go faster.
---
Should  be under game settings when you‚Äôre in game.
---
Press esc for the map, and Z to open up the menu. Then settings. I can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs under gameplay or a different one but you‚Äôll find it.
---
Upset none of the comments so far got the reference :(
---
Maybe a little. ‚ÄòBalls deep‚Äô was highly unnecessary.
---
Yeah I was intoxicated playing one night and realized this and omg it actually gave me chills
---
Why not just create another xbox account and don't let them use yours.
---
And do it while the timer counts down to event start!
---
So literally the same exact enemies and place as yesterday but they explode, again. Thanks bethesda, these daily ops totally aren't repetitive and lackluster.
---
Thanks for the answers, good to know I'm pretty screwed.
---
I‚Äôve been having this same problem, I can‚Äôt figure it out. Had to change my build.
---
Like hearing them in an area 30 minutes after that player has left
---
Its patched, no?
---
I cant do it. Maybe console ps4 is patched.
---
Yes! That as well.
---
I know it ‚Äúsounds‚Äù farfetched, but lock picking and hacking other players things do have in game consequences. Meaning that it is an intended feature, and so long as a person doesn‚Äôt overstep and interact with other players beyond the limits of the games intended mechanics then I see nothing wrong with picking and hacking other players locks.
---
That said I‚Äôd need to also be formidable at PVP since I‚Äôll often likely be hunted by bounty hunters. This means I need a build that can manage to get away and fight other players.
---
Why? Caps. The build wants to win PVP for caps. Steal from resource machines for caps. Taking workshops means taking resources, and that means taking caps.
---
Raiders want caps. So this seems like the most profitable and practical way to role play a raider without over stepping the games mechanics.
---
Often times the people that I‚Äôd considered to be harassers or trollish griefers would be the ones that use exploits and try to bully people into PVP. I think that sort of behavior is deplorable. People like that take things way beyond the boundaries that the game has put in place and they try to target people in real life.
---
I‚Äôm sternly against that type of behavior, and honestly I can‚Äôt understand why people so often misconstrue a request for what is essentially just a ‚Äúcriminal build‚Äù for being ‚Äútroll‚Äù.
---
In fallout New Vegas, 3, and 4 all I made were criminal builds. In Skyrim and Oblivion I made evil necromancers.
---
So of course there‚Äôd be a large demographic of players who enjoy being evil ‚Äúin the game‚Äù. It‚Äôs not as though I aim to make people miserable in real life.
---
This is one of those issues where I'm genuinely fascinated trying to think about how it could even happen
---
Maybe some who don't know better but not mine. Once your in it you either wait for your death or log out the game.
---
Yeah you cant have two level 3 cards need to scrap before you can level up.
---
what?
---
Hey, I jump on my private server, claim about 3-4 workshops, quickly set them up with blueprints and then go off and do something else.  
---
Do quick rounds to pick up everything, move onto something else.
---
When an event comes, I might jump to it, my turrets kill everything on their own. I just go and collect rewards. If i‚Äôm busy, i‚Äôll just do the reclaim event after.
---
They are a perfect free resource, even gets me caps and plans
---
I mean, all I hear is "HRHRMNRNRGG". Where/how are people translating this to "HELLO I'M MOLE MINER. DIE"?
---
His thumbnail is of him bending over Earle though, seems quite fitting to me sir.
---
Most camps have so many I dont feel bad for jacking some.
---
I am rolling with the fashionable raider outfit. I like the look. I use it on my more modern pirate ship character.
---
Hey Mr. From the Future, when some company invents text chat in games, maybe Bethesda can add it.  In fact, maybe they have a team of 1000 trying to invent this right now, but you‚Äôre just too impatient.  
---
Maybe you‚Äôd be better off waiting for us to put a human in space or circumnavigate the globe.

---
That's a real common mentality these days
---
It happens every hour or so during primal cuts for me. Ive never seen them before the event started but they seem quire common to happen now. Thst probably because I do a lot of primal cuts because of their exp.
---
I have a new Xbox and these people always say ‚ÄúgEt a NeW xBoX‚Äù gtfo.
---
I love Ice Road Truckers ): it‚Äôs a really good show. Used to watch it religiously, lol.
---
Okay so I checked and unfortunately I do not but I'll ask around!
---
Tec_ is wrong the level of enemys is set to your level except bosses Daily ops are a really good source of xp plans and ammo and allways stop by to scorched earth or Collusus trouble Earle is Monaghan mine during Nuke zone and Scorche beast queen during Nuke zone spawns in watoga And I suggest collecting every 3* weapon you come across and sell it to the purveyor up in the rusty pick
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Thats odd. Is it rare? I randomly walked into Grafton 2 days ago and saw some fat ass monster running around and I killed it solo with grenades and it said I completed an event. Im like cool. Walked away.
---
I'm a non-VATS user and love it. The sights aren't the best but still pretty good. The main issue is its higher spread makes it inconsistent at long range, but you can even lead flying scorchbeasts with it if they are not too far away
---
Ohh, so buggy weapons Bethesda didn‚Äôt remove because baby‚Äôs whine and you want to show off like it‚Äôs a achievement. Good job kid, now please pick up your crayons.
---
Stupid rare. Expect to never ever get it as a drop. Trade price is in the 30-50k cap range.
---
It's even worse than that.
---
Depending on the weapon you use "holding your breath" will block movement on either the y or x axis, while other weapons can be moved freely.
---
The voice is heavily edited and distorted, but it's from the wiki. :)
---
I wouldn't mind if they are trying. But this group today was literally trolling or idk. They refused to get on point just walking around. I emoted for them to come by they didn't care. They were not new either, lvl 200+. Missed out on timer by 48 sec for Elder. Ran is solo an got Elder.
---
I was too...I think the voice is so distorted you need to be in a "looser" state to really hear it. lol
---
I‚Äôm not home and my dad is not very tech savvy so I‚Äôm just gonna step him through the process of uninstalling it.
---
good idea, and also MUTATIONS section, please! And please add one crazy scientist in the game, maybe with Brotherhood faction.
---
"I don't know man, let me bring in my guy. He's an expert on legacy gatling plasmas."
---
Ammo factory is useless now, we can have one of our own in our workshop, and not only that, we have ammosmith+ ammo factory LP + super duper. As of level 3 ammo factory I can craft 432 ultracite rounds for my caster and what ever super duper feels like giving me.
---
Fusion cores last forever with power user and the new LP electric absorption making them nearly unlimited. I find left over FC and convert 2 basic almost empty cores into 7 1000 round ultracite cores. power plants are useless man
---
I guess I‚Äôm just not into sexually assaulting a video game character, even in a poor-taste metaphor?
---
dunno, I think Riley would agree with me :\^)
---
Same as before. Levels don‚Äôt have to be twice the target. Only difference.
---
I am mainly bloodied so I‚Äôm sure I could spare my unused TSE for science.
---
Buzzed icon cause reasons
---
That happens with other guns too.
---
I have inconsistent results. It definitely happens after you use VATS. I used VATS on NPCs and then free-aimed a player and my damage was bugged out still. Another time I just free-aimed and it happened as well.
---
I guess it‚Äôs a bug in progress :/
---
Sexually assaulting a video game character XD Damn nah you right. That is just wrong!
---
Hunter‚Äôs longcoat
---
No idea who that is sir. ^_^
---
Then explain why Speed Demon isn‚Äôt affected. I prefer popping serums anyway - it negates *all* the negatives, not just mitigates them. I don‚Äôt need mitigation unless I‚Äôm fighting someone hard to kill.
---
It's not completely that. It's a futuristic alternative (pip boys, robots and a world using nuclear energy alot etc) for the 50s, plus another futuristic addition of the literal fallout can alternatively change into the type of dialogue it has. Personally I think it's immersive.
---
Or, he just wanted to show it was possible to kill Earle in under 1 minute after the DMG nerf. ^_^ You can downplay and describe it however you'd like, the end result is his boat came first past the finish line. He is now #1 for the fastest Earle kill. ^_^ SORRY that makes you so upset sir!
---
Hot damn that‚Äôs what I was looking for and couldn‚Äôt find it. Thank you.
---
From the beginning before they met you they've been assholes to others.
---
One of my toons is bloodied heavy and he‚Äôs become my favourite after the nerf. I‚Äôve not gotten the t65 on him yet, I don‚Äôt know why, but I run sh with emergency protocols and don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm low health he‚Äôs tanky af. If you do go heavy I‚Äôd suggest trying to find a bloodied .50cal as it feels the best rounded to me. Minis are not bad but the ammo consumption is a chore to keep up with and the windup of it and Gatling lasers/plasmas is fine vs bosses but when you go to shoot a mole rat and have to wait for the gun it just seems a little ehhhgg.
---
I got 1st for the monthly atoms, the private world and scrapbox are just useful bonuses. I play the game enough that spending that amount is ok with me.
---
I sell them to bots. Quick cash.
---
Nm
---
Speed demon is. You do you dude just trying to help, carnivore also helps with mitigating speed demon because 1 raw scorch beast part does 50%
---
That -4 int must hurt your xp gain if you run marsupial all the time. 
---
Also why do you care about the speed demon negatives? If you have the materials for all these serums and no food sounds like you need better inventory management. 
---
And before you get on me and say you do more damage I solo killed the queen in 40 seconds without a magic gun, melee only. It takes me about 3 minutes after nerf with a rifle.
---
Earle in 2 minutes pre nerf haven't tried post
---

---
The draw of SS armor isn't necessarily  that it h as better resistances (which it still does even if DR has diminishing returns because of the innate rad resist) but in that it removes two extra levels of RNG from getting your ideal legendary armor.  Unless you're buying your legendary armor you also have to worry about whether a drop is going to have the rolls you want, be the right type of armor and be the right grade, but with SS armor all you have to worry about is the legendary effects because it's always going to be SS armor with the highest possible DR on it.
---
This is sick. I love their muffled anger but this makes it that much more chilling.
---
That was a tad bit snarky Don‚Äôt you think
---
God has selected you to win a *free* iPod Nano.
---
Im a noob and pretty much have no idea what I am doing at any event.
---
It‚Äôs there a perk I need to sell to vendors? I am unable to sell anything to them.
---
Cool. If you find a punch owl or a nuka keg Do Not Take From It.
---
Looks awesome. Amazes me how people figure these things out.
---
Yeah its super buggy right now for me too
---
   
---
Dadsdaddad: Isn‚Äôt it weird when virgins use phrases like, ‚Äúballs deep‚Äù?
---
Also Dadsdaddad: *even in a poor-taste metaphor?*   
---
So saying virgins using this term is wrong/funny (you're implying that only Chad's like yourself should use it)... Only to turn around 5 minutes later and say only those with poor taste use it?  
---
Which is it? Can't be both sir. \^\_\^
---
Ya it technically comes with explosive damage and even though its ammo is an energy type it does ballistic damage
---
Happens all the time in NW.
---
It doesn‚Äôt hurt a lot, I run Unyielding for PvE. And I‚Äôm always on a casual team for the Intelligence buff and Strange in Numbers.
---
Also, you can use whatever weapon you want during the op, just make sure you switch to an ultracite weapon before the boss is killed and you will be rewarded ultracite rounds.
---
How are you getting a build within water? Nice water areas also. I keep trying to set camp to encompass water and it just won't....
---
I know right? lol
---
Clearly bothers you to make a post about that and assumed it was a flex instead of the person just wanting to get the rewards for himself.
---
It's like a comma, in the middle of a sentence where you shouldn't be pausing.
---
If you get elder, you have a 80% chance at 3 rewards with their own separate rng drop. Ive managed to get nothing like 4 days in a row.
---
So can you make an explosive gauss mini gun or is still classified as an energy gun?
---
I can sneak up to anything and kiss them with 2.00x sneak. Ghouls and scorched seem to ignore sneak sometimes. I am starting to think it‚Äôs a bug that they just left in as a feature lol...
---
Camp building
---
I found myself running it solo a couple times because others wouldn't join the event,and it wasn't due to the full bonding either.im looking for that extra XP ,maybe even some drops so if anyone is waiting to participate throw out their Gt and I'll join their team.
---
Soooo... They're looking for a Balrog, right? 
---
I'll have to pay attention to their idle lines next time. I always though they were little more than animals at this point, just intelligent enough to use a shotgun. But damn, that's mental. And metal af... "Never see the light again!" Holy schneet.
---
Are you thinking of bufftats maybe
---
I saw someone wearing it with the limited time minuteman general outfit. Probably won't re-release though, sorry.
---
Yeah but you could get better buffs with all the mutations, but you do you unoptimized is fun too
---
I love mole miner lore soooo much. Now I‚Äôm watching videos of hostile mole miners and trying to see if I can understand anything they‚Äôre saying. At 2:08 in this video I‚Äôm pretty positive he says the ‚Äúgoing to fucking kill you‚Äù line.
---
https://youtu.be/g9PYF2bXaG0
---
Edit ooh at 3:05 I think he says ‚Äútear your face in half‚Äù
---
Definitely meat related, literally all my meat drops have been 2 legendaries
---
You can always farm the resources you need, I would sell em. It sounds like you just need craft more shit.
---
I use PA, and have medical pump on the torso, I shoot only what I really have too, and run past everything else. Once you know the dungeons and where to go you'll start seeing gains. Big thing is to find a weapon that kills effiently. 
---
I use gattling until thw boss where I use a mini gun. I keep having to stash 5mm. 
---
My Heavy Gun perks are a 2 star, 1 star, and 1 star. So I'm not min/maxed or anything. 
---
Also blood eagles are good for stim farming in the regular map as well.
---
Cool. I‚Äôm not using legendary slots for core charging or ammo, yet, and I haven‚Äôt completed my raider grind. I sell cores and keep a couple for junk runs when I want some carry boost, not a entire build. 
---
So, plenty useful. Plus, food is always useful.
---
Personally I like the Confederate Uniform with it.
---
Alot of people sleep on the good old guass rifle but with the right build it puts in work
---
That's great advice. Thank you!
---
Oh that silly spat? I could of sworn he proved all of that wrong and even admitted to his own wrong doing here sir? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsmVUfqP80g&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsmVUfqP80g&amp;) \^\_\^ Notice how that Rage channel has since died? Top vid has 1k views in 2 weeks... Feels bad for him sir. \^\_\^
---
Do you think everyone who plays the same game as you speaks the same language too?
---
Off of what level of enemies?
---
You can get them from legendary scorchbeasts as a rare drop. Got mine that way.
---
They work:  
---
1. Most of the time  
---
2. In VATS is best  
---
3.  AA, Bloodied, and Instigating are pretty great. I cannot speak to other primary affixes.
---
When they don't work:  
---
1. Out of VATS terribly well  
---
2. They sometimes rubberband health on the enemy. I dumped 12 shots with a bloodied pump action into a scorched today and didn't kill it.  
---
3. Reload on pump actions is really frustrating. If you try to fire with one shot in, it just resets the animation - you can end up locked in busy events just trying to fire a damn shell.  
---
4. The Fancy Shotgun is great, but in daily ops you don't get shotgun shells back from enemies.  
---
Realistically, you could gain 30 levels and run either shotgun or heavy weapons or melee. Perks are not that different overall.
---
Taking serums when I need them is more optimal than wasting 3 points in luck I can use for Tormentor, for example.
---
By home screen, do you mean the start screen before going into the game, or the map/menu screen once in the game?
---
I've avoided doing daily ops since it's recommended level 50, are they worth doing at my level?
---
And I'm currently running along the main overseer quest, but I needed to stop from it to get to level 20 so I'm doing the fire breathers exams down in charleston I believe.
---
Are you using weight reduct armour/backpack?
---
They don't get counted when in PA, I have a few weapon weight reduct pieces and when I get in PA I skyrocket to like 900kg.
---
Better off trying to find someone to craft the mod for caps and materials.
---
it's a shame your not on xbox, I'd wander with you and could join our little group! cant wait if they intend to add crossplay!
---
best of luck on your adventures!!
---
Thank you for the PVP advice. I‚Äôll look into some decent full health builds. Perhaps ones that don‚Äôt need VATS as the VATS perks take up quite a bit of perk points. Appreciate your suggestions.
---
As far as the community. Idk. I can‚Äôt speak for the community, and I‚Äôve met some really nice people, but I don‚Äôt understand why PVP leaves such a bad taste in people‚Äôs mouths.
---
I‚Äôve played other MMORPGs with PVP and PVE and they‚Äôre always at each others throats. I think from a balance perspective PVPers have the keenest insight into the mechanics that should be addressed.
---
From a PVE perspective people tend to have a keener insight into what sort of world themes and ‚Äúfun‚Äù ideas should be added to the game.
---
I enjoy both PVE and PVP in FO76. Because I think it‚Äôs funny to be obliterated by a person with a giant machine gun. I think it‚Äôs fun to get into a shootout with an enemy and then cannibalize them when they‚Äôre on their knees.
---
There shouldn‚Äôt need to be either one or the other.
---
That said I assume survival servers (that I never got to play on) turned strictly PVE people off of PVP. There are also those few people that always chime in and say, ‚ÄúThis game isn‚Äôt meant for PvP‚Äù. 
---
Well, I think it is. I think it‚Äôs meant for both PVE and PVP. I love gardening and building fun bases, and unique characters. I like gifting, emoting, and killing legendary creatures. I like events and taking cool photos - but I also enjoy killing other players. I enjoy it a lot, and now I‚Äôm ready to experience the wanted system and the criminal activities in the game.
---
That should be okay.
---
You double posted this, btw
---
No you don't. You want a real one so when they finally fix this you aren't still a trash can.
---
That's good to hear
---
This read like poetry. Thank you.
---
I don‚Äôt think my first comment implies that at all. You‚Äôre reaching. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòò
---
You definitely want power armor for heavies now more than ever.
---
Oh yeah. I‚Äôm super salty some internet hero took advantage of things so out of balance it‚Äôs impossible to get new ones, and he did it fast. Wow. So cool. I hope I can suck this heroes dick. /s if that shit ain‚Äôt obvious.
---
My camp is just outside the train station near the 1st lake and I moved my turrets to stop the creatures attacking my base. They get one-shotted by the Yui GUI and wolves instantly.
---
I just wish they had released the update with out the nerf. Then seen how people dealt with the increased difficulty. Before changing the damage out put for people.
---
I did one run with a level 400+ on the resilient robots and he wouldn't even go to the uplinks, I actually ended up leaving the team and ran it solo. But it's crazy, with low level characters I usually get a better time than with the high levels. Thankfully the ops are doable solo, just pretty difficult.
---
Yes but 10 times rarer a drop on a normal scorchbeast.
---
I know right? lol As for what they are looking for...that's an interesting tease. If you check the basement at the Rusty Pick you'll see the tunnel system. So they must have tunnels all over Appalachia, maybe following the Mother Lode. It would be epic to have an underground city we find at some point.
---
Play what you want. Any build can be good with the right planning.
---
Strange same last night disconnected as I dropped the last bad guy but was happy to see the rewards.aside that I wiped out a guys vendor that had about 10 3 star weapons with rw on them for about 300 caps a piece nothing great but really good for my script bank
---
It can be all explosive guns. Minis can be really bad as well but I usually only notice it on really laggy servers. Tesla‚Äôs seem to have been the worst for it for a while. I guess what I‚Äôm unfortunately trying to tell you is that sometimes this game just doesn‚Äôt run the best.
---
Wow, man
---
https://youtu.be/bDuT2VTDKKk
---
dunno, I still think Riley would disagree. I saved those videos by the way, so even if the originals go down, I'll just reup them :\^)
---
Yup!
---
Please remove legendary popups, I want to aim.
---
Jesus have to start farming them too.
---
So why join a team if you're not ready when 9/10 I make or join one they go as soon as there's 3 or 4 people?
---
when they finally fix this
---
It can be hard without good high tier gear, it took me a massive amount of time and a lot of trading to get the good stuff I have now. Keep at it and be persistent, it takes time and effort but it's well worth it when you get that rare piece you've been searching for. Familiarize yourself with the valuable, Meta relevant effects. You'll be surprised what you can get with decent trades that you dont think are too valuable.
---
I could/ should have done better...
---
Yes you get your atoms back it's happened to me a few months ago.
---
Psa: it's even easier to farm materials for them and you'll get way way more.
---
Why take ghoulish if you have no rads? Also what rads as a perk is pretty shitty, not worth the slot imo. Just get healing factor mutation
---
It's impossible to get new ones? Are you aware that there are more BE Plasmas in the game's circulation than players, playing said game? 
---
There are hundreds of thousands of BE Plasmas and is why the gun is worth less than non godtier legacy drops. :) Maybe if you knew a thing or two about the actual state of the economy and weapons you'd save yourself that embarrassment.
---
Gauss + instigating + anti armor + silenced = over 1400 per headshot (daytime)
---
Have fun :)
---
Edit : No Vats used (that would be a toddlers game)
---
Just beware when making your pa choice than ultracite and strangler heart are very hard to find emergency protocols and calibrated shocks for. Making t65 probably the best choice.
---
Well no of course not hon I am simply a friend. \^\_\^
---
Interesting, I'll keep that in mind. I just started a new character that's going to be a junkies melee with vanguard armor. Going to give it a try, thanks!
---
Honestly, I always felt they had to be saying SOMETHING. Especially when they wind up their attacks and take a swing with their gauntlet it always sounded like they were saying something like "Take this!". 
---
I imagine they'll get some kind of update eventually, since they hint that miners have tunnels all over the Appalachian underground and NPCs, like raiders, comment how they'd like to "take the fight to them, but those fucking tunnels could collapse at any second", which implies they know roughly where a "base" might be to retaliate. Can't just spend time, money and resources to put this all in place only to abandon it and waste said resources.
---
Yes, you have to use the handheld camera for it to count.
---
So that‚Äôs a glitch? i thought it is new feature lol
---
Ill line the cave with your bones
---
I LOVE doing daily ops. I'd do them nonstop if I could find a team to just keep running them.
---
It should be resolved now according to the forum post bethesda just posted
---
T-65 does seem like.the best choice.
---
~~I‚Äôll have to try. Thanks!~~
---
edit: well shit, it worked!
---
Can I still melee ok in PA?
---
No wonder my brother hates mole miners the most... beats out mole rats hah
---
Not enemys.   Itens on the ground
---
The overweight I‚Äôm used to. As you noted, I run weight reducing armor. It‚Äôs the nonfunctioning AP that‚Äôs frustrating.
---
The ultimate reward for getting to tier 100 in this new season is the bluegrass power armor, comes custom with overalls and a straw hat
---
This is the place I built this camp [https://imgur.com/a/brl7gNJ](https://imgur.com/a/brl7gNJ)
---
Perfect area with a large pool of water, no enemy spawns plus you can set up at different sides of the. Before placing my camp I just backup towards the water and place camp at the edge to give myself plenty of build room in the water. Thanks for the award btw that's awesome
---
they say these all the time its just so distorted its really hard to make it out
---
Yeah. I feel like the people complaining really just need to work on their gear and build. Things are a bit tougher now. But still very doable
---
I couldn't get a shotgun build to work, but my wife cripples everything with hers so it seems pretty viable.
---
You can‚Äôt get one with the legendary effect explosive if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. Each shot does have innate explosive damage though. So demo expert does work
---
Ok got it thx
---
Nope. None. You are imagining it.
---
Thank you! Appreciate it
---
I just checked. My Atoms are back. Yay. Thanks for the update.
---
Enclave officer, insurgent.
---
I'm sorry but no, the very fact there is conflict here is a result of Bethesda's design. That alone is enough
---
That's probably why. When a dead enemies meat pile despawns it drops the items on the ground for anyone to pick up. The legendary items you are seeing are generated by the level of the player who killed the enemy.
---
You don‚Äôt have to wait though. I have the bug right now. Was able to pull of map and enter daily ops. I‚Äôm on level 32 atm
---
Me too. Would be such a good addition. Improved damage, fire rate, and range over the lever, fixer/battlerifle. Would use .308 I'd guess. And with some decent clip and sight mods it'd be a go to for me. Devs please consider this suggestion. TY
---
If you place the mirror ball inside the table tv, it will show up with a green and grassy picture rather than the white screen
---
I didn't know this.
---
Have to agree with that.
---
Not dead enemies.   Like. You go into a house.   Theres a random spawn pistol on a couch next to a dead skeleton.  It will he lvl 50 regardless of where i am
---
Throw in some sound effects? I'd jump on that if it were in the Atom shop
---
They fixed teslas. I figure if they can do that, maybe they can fix fast firing explosive weapons as well.
---
Yoohoo welcome to the community! Enjoy yourself it is a wonderful community. Take it all in the game has some really beautiful views.
---
You do you dude I think we have different playstyles, everything is a 1 or 2 shot so tormentor isn't needed for me, I'm out tho
---
I mean, why would you want to?  What's the purpose?  You should choose one or the other, not both.
---
Is the game even fun at that point, just walking up to arguably the hardest boss spraying him with a legacy and dusting off your shoulder. It wasn‚Äôt a dmg nerf as much as a rebalance to make the game not just a one shot party.
---
any shotgun can be magic. just find one piece of legendary armor with the right perk, but i would only use it until you reach the 45/50 mark.  I had a shotgun build going and after a while, when i shouldve been one/two shotting things, they would rubberband to half full life. 
---
Unless you want to stay a shotgun build, dont worry about maxing out the shotgun cards...get that xp and work on a more viabke build, in my opinion.
---
I'm pretty sure that they are adding more but the new daily ops wont be ready until 2021? I read it somewhere but I cant remember where.
---
this is definitely the best we can do right now. I found this out about a week ago and now all my tvs have them hah I just wish I didn't have to turn them on every time I load the game. Same with radios.
---
When ramming into enemies with pain train, it plays sounds of a banjo being broken on things
---
Mandatory:
---
At least one person on drum
---
At least 1 person on grill
---
IMMEDIATELY stop and brush fires
---
Clean up any obvious rotten leftovers and poo piles (can be hard to see)
---
Optional:
---
Turn in prime meat
---
Collect and turn in greens
---
Use multi-targetting gun to quickly kill multiple critters then collect and turn in critter meat
---
I may have left some out. The things I listed as mandatory are to prevent the meter from running backwards.
---
Oh, so his is duped too? Yeah, there‚Äôs lots of dupes of guns you can‚Äôt get that, if a good company was managing it, would have been removed or changed.
---
Are you fucking this yt, cause you are all over defending them like it‚Äôs personal.
---
Sickening. :-(
---
Oh well I dont think I have ever found a random legendary Luke that so that's interesting
---
Yeah its solved now
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve been sitting on a Bloodied combat rifle because I have somewhat resistant going to bloodied due to my perception of the effort involved. I think I might just do that, switch it up for commando. Thanks for the great suggestion and of course for the offer of a gun. You‚Äôre a good person.
---
Thats called Kaoken. It increases your base power level by x10.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Sounds like a Plan.
---
I had cloaking blood eagles in vault 76 yesterday. I think earlier this week was resilient robots in valley galleria.
---
Communist detected on american soil, leathal force engaged.(For real though the community and game are great!)
---
Burning Mine i hate it.
---
You'd be pretty angry too being stuck in that damn suit all the time lol
---
Hahaha.
---
Isn‚Äôt there an imposter mask?
---
Killed by a legacy energy weapon.
---
Also possible that nobody is occupying your spot. Happened to me several times,  checked out my location and it was unoccupied.ü§îüòÄüòÄ
---
My absolute favorite part was doing the exploring and following story trails in the beginning. It‚Äôs a beautiful world and beautifully sad story. The mmo aspects in the late game.. that I don‚Äôt care for so much.
---
I run around with 10 agility and 3x sneak and can poke scorched In the booty before they notice me
---
Full disclosure, I went back to my main and tacked on a dozen more levels. I've learned to cope with 1W and while I do miss being able to make mobs explode with a single shot, I've resigned myself to just eat more ammo for the same effect. I also changed the receivers around a bit on my ranged weapons and that's helped a but.  I still have issues with being able to sneak, it's hardly worth it now. Hope that gets fixed. Back to the re-reroll...
---
**Random Thoughts, Levels 6 - 11:**
---
1. **Dang It:**
---
   1. Still short on ammo, surprisingly.
---
   2. I've not used any legendary PERKs yet, I don't want to waste them on the early levels.
---
   3. Still broke AF. Handies behind The Wayward just don't pay like they used to.
---
   4. I miss some of the plans that I have on my main. Oh well, I'll get there eventually.
---
2. **Accept It:**
---
   1. This time around, I'm going for an "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em" approach. *Bloodied Melee Build, here I come*. I did the build I liked (my main), time to try the one that seems so popular.
---
   2. Definitely going to tout the advantages of being a 1st member. Not having a full-ass stash makes all this so much easier.
---
   3. Having a main whose done just about all of it makes this easier the 2nd time around for sure.
---
   4. I still tend to stick to the same sort of locations-by-level that I did before 1W.
---
3. **OK... So:**
---
   1. I save a lot on ammo with a melee build.
---
   2. I do more damage with a melee build.
---
   3. I take more damage with a melee build.
---
   4. I use a lot of stimpaks with a melee build.
---
   5. I'm only level 11, so the notion of "bloodied" is a long way off. Right now it's more like a damage-sponge, stimpak-junky build.
---
   6. So far, so good?
---
4. **This is cool:**
---
   1. Actually knowing what the fuck is going on now, I can choose PERK cards much more appropriately, knowing which ones will be useful NOW and LATER. I definitely didn't know that the first time around.
---
   2. These levels felt like that came on fast, but Meat Week might have helped with that.
---
Anyway, see you in 5 more levels or so.
---
Because it's fun and heavy weapons eat through ammo?
---
I'm more fascinated about the fact that such an in-your-face issue has been ignored for 2 fuckin years lmao. It even affects gamepad/console users...
---
Add me gt videoweevil7089 ,I'll make the run with you.
---
Hopefully all these useful replies will help others.
---
Vampire Weapon and speed seems to be the recipe for success.
---
Aren‚Äôt nearly all locals dead, and the npc are literally colonizers from outside the area?
---
I have some sign plans from Paladin.
---
No idea if they will be the same as yours though.
---
If players want to PVP, they would play it. It could also be a boon for those that like open world PVP as it would gather them all together rather than them just hoping they come across another random person that enjoys it while on a normal server.
---
If (to pull a random number from my rear) let's say only 5% of the population wants open world PVP then you would on average only have 1 PVP player on any given server. That leaves many PVP players with nobody for them to play with. Give them a server of their own and you now have a server with 20 PVP players on it while 20 other servers now have 19 PVE players on them. You have just increased the happiness of 20 PVP players and however many PVE players that they would have ran across and tried to fight while playing that night. This seems like an all around win to me.
---
If nobody played on those servers then it would seem to me that it's a clear message that players do not want to PVP in the game. So why would we even have PVP as an option at that point?
---
This started happening today for me as well, on PC (non-Steam version). The only difference I can think of is that I ran a daily op successfully yesterday on one character for the first time ever, however the op window being open on the map is happening on all characters, not just her. I tried running an op with her again today and it didn't fix it. Dunno if running ops is related to the problem but I thought I'd mention it.
---
I haven‚Äôt run daily ops sub-lvl 50....but it‚Äôs a great way to lvl up quickly.  If you have a crew to run an event group with...that‚Äôs another good way to get XP when you grind daily events.
---
But still trash? Hah ive seen it happen now too but always only one stars
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got everything, that‚Äôs funny I seriously have been swimming in those plans but I‚Äôve been running a lot of meat weeks
---
Last Meat Week (last month) I never got clued in that the Meat Cook was held hourly at the top of the hour, so I only did it a few times despite playing every day.  Had a bunch of prime cuts go bad in my inventory because I didn‚Äôt see the notification, etc.  This time around, I‚Äôm hopping up that hill 2 minutes before every hour to do my part.
---
Pisses me off I am trying to figure this daily ops shit and I am just trying to move towards the objective and clearing enemies and get booted by the leader.  
---
It‚Äôs shit like that I hate about the MMO part of this game.  You try and dicks just boot you anyway.
---
I have spent months avoiding events not feeling confident in my skills or build and take a leap and try something new just to deal with dumb shit....
---
Stop thinking people are not doing their best but trying to learn.  Build private teams and stop being assholes to those trying on public teams.
---
Ghoulish only heals you while you're being exposed to radiation. If you're in a heavily irradiated area you'll probably remove the rads quicker than they will build up, and it will still heal you. I have healing factor, but this combination works while in combat, too.
---
The day before yesterday, my bad. Point still stands tho
---
Stay away from roads, and government buildings
---
I've actually gotten some decent drops
---
I'll give it a shot
---
Oh yeah, I forgot there was a 5 coming out ü§î I'm sure he will research everything before he purchases our next console! He played the PC version of FF for yeeeeaars... he is determined to get this game, lol. I'll let him know about the PRO suggestion! Thanks üòä
---
I'd love to have one up but rip my camp budget lol
---
I have 2 star What Rads and loving it, also use healing factor which only regenerates my health when no enemies are around.
---
Im talking about regular weapons not legendarys....
---
West Virginia isn't the only place in America that's culturally Appalachian, though. Think a group of cultural adopters, like the Kings in NV, would be cool too
---
Oh my god is that how it works? Bruh I've been holding onto like 7 animated cards that aren't quite finished lmao
---
Accidents happen, bud. If you didn‚Äôt know it could‚Äôve be destroyed by shooting it and he didn‚Äôt know either, you‚Äôre probably both going to find it funny eventually. I‚Äôd have died laughing. ...literally(in game)! ü§£
---
I see. It looks like the same glow that comes up when you turn into an ash pile.
---
They're asking for a mask to wear with that. I always just went with a gas mask when I used that outfit.
---
I messaged them on the Xbox messenger and I had power armor that I found during a mission but as a low level I had no fusion cores and I had to much weight on  me.
---
Interesting. I knew the plasma blade was hot garbage due to split damage being gutted by defenses, but the cryo blade seems really nice if the cryo damage is similarly unresisted like Fire damage (also, sad that Friendly Fire doesn't work with the fire blade. RIP spear medic dreams).
---
:D thanks that absolutely makes sense!
---
Yeah gear can make a big difference. You don‚Äôt need god rolls although they‚Äôre nice but the right primary perks for your build changes everything. Only thing that sucks and leaves some people in the dust is how harsh the rng can be. But tough it out search player vendors and maybe visit a certain trading sub and you‚Äôll find out how much fun it is. Personally I love the new wasteland but I do really feel for people starting out.
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/it9qed/fallout_76_update_22_patch_notes_september_15_2020/g5cw0k9) redditor keeps a list and updates it every patch. I think they've done it from the very beginning
---
Idk if you wanna do that chief. This last update made me quit, and I had a lot of faith in bethesda but not anymore
---
Healing factor was like the second mutation I ever got and I've been using it ever since. The perk cards that reduce negative mutation effects are great.
---
Start your own team, wah.
---
This is a rant, not a PSA.
---
You mean player vendors? You can't sell to those. But the npc robots like the ones at train stations you can sell to, and they buy anything until you've made 1400 caps and then you have to wait until tomorrow to sell more. Hard Bargain (I think is the perk name) gives you better prices but you can sell stuff without it
---
I‚Äôm not super high - level 63 and when I finish DO I seem to only get three stars. But shitty stuff like golf clubs and other melee. Or like things I‚Äôd never use - like Gatling lasers that use fusion cores.
---
Pvp :)
---
He has some crazy and fast paced youtube videos. more entertaining than informative.
---
Trading
---
I would also propose if you start said group and then initiate said event, please do not ghost the rest of the team once they show up to do the event with you and disconnect or choose another group/event.
---
I used to have my camp in the Mire, not too far from the crashed airplane there is a waterfall which makes a nice spot
---
Gonna be trying one for the first time today as a lvl 20ish. Little worried that I wont do the right things when needed, but so far I've heard as long as I'm on the objective then it's all good, hopefully.
---
You will lose any photos on that Xbox
---
Smart move, I bought it at release and was so pissed I put it down for a year and a half, then picked it up, and it's been the game of the summer so far. Protips: the hardest part of the game is inventory management. The weight restrictions on you and your stash are the worst/hardest/most limiting part of the game. Don't feel the need to packrat everything/anything, it'll just slow you down and waste your time. Items max out at level 50. If it's not a level 45/50 item that is a 3-star legendary, it is typically garbage that you will be scrapping very soon after getting it, so don't hesitate. The best legendary effects are explosive, bloodied, junkies, and instigating. Stealth is your friend, it is worth investing in for any build. You only need a max of 6 intel, and that's on the high end. The best SPECIAL traits are agility and perception, unless you are a melee build, then it's strength. Get serums asap, with the traits in luck that make them permanent, especially marsupial, speed demon, carnivore, and anything else that pertains to your build. If you find a good explosive shotgun, that can be your, "I need to kill everything here fast," gun. I've found shotguns to be useless without VATs, but when you do use VATs with them, it's insane.
---
The ‚Äúneed to keep digging, we‚Äôll find it soon‚Äù is so interesting to me, I REALLY hope they expand on Mole Miner lore because now I need to know what the hell theyre searching for.
---
Or just make it matchmaking like every other multiplayer before that. You select Dailey ops and it puts you on a team of other people who are playing Dailey ops
---
Sound like plan I think this should be made by the devs or the community manager. So we know it's been seen.
---
Wait you can have a mask with the imposter mask?
---
That‚Äôs some pretty crazy shit right there!
---
Ironic.
---
The event is bad in my opinion
---
* *How about a three-star legendary rolling pin? Only 100 scrp sound good?*
---
End game for me is camp building. I started another alt just to make another camp. Just about happy with my pirate ship build, though I am now at that stage where I am finding things to delete so that I can replace them with something else. How about a little more space Bethesda? 
---
I still grind daily‚Äôs and scrip and all the other stuff but that it‚Äôs just all daily upkeep. Making my camp is what keeps me playing beyond the daily grind.
---
Some days are like that and I'm sorry you've been having bag experiences. Just a few tips to try and help you out; enemies will infinitely respawn so its best to sprint straight to the objective. I tend to follow other players because i don't know the maps yet. And be sure to stay close enough to the objective to power it up. It'll tell you on the top right hope many players are within range.
---
Best of luck to you. And try not to let assholes ruin the fun of the game for you.
---
I havnt seen any post asking personally, but what evs lol
---
[Here ya go!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creature_taming) Locations/maps and types have not changed. If someone shares Animal Friend 3 any level can tame.
---
Same here. I also have responder themed items around my camp placed in the forest. I met someone when I first started who had their camp who had everything unlocked, a huge farm of crops and water, all free for the taking to help new vault dwellers. Now that I'm a lot more deep into the game I wanted to carry on that same idea under the responders banner.
---
Yeah, lots of stuff works with it. I should try wearing my Free Radicals mask with it sometime to see if that works.
---
Helping newbees
---
O damn. Thanks for the heads up
---
Shit I need your luck. One handed melee and heavy guns is what I need more of
---
PvP? If you don‚Äôt, I recommend doing so, if you have a build that can maintain 200+ DPS. The damage cap might be 110, but with all the shit they can throw against you, it‚Äôll reduce your effective damage to just above, or if you‚Äôre fighting someone with good gear who‚Äôs mastered using said gear you won‚Äôt do a lot of damage at all. If you hit for 300 damage normally, then I‚Äôll take that and make it 30, if not less. So your effective damage is only 30. Just an example. And staggering stops both sentinel and cavaliers from proccing, which is why I have Tormentor - crippling causes an auto stagger.
---
I suppose I'll repost it and change the title up
---
Thanks. Pretty sure this hasn‚Äôt been said a thousand times before. Refreshing to hear a new idea.
---
Btw.  Should probably read the rules.
---
I play fo76 on and off but have never played during meat week (I should change that but I just got my 3080 and dont own the game on pc). Still even I know that it helps. People get angry over silly things.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really bother me
---
What platform do you play on?  I literally don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm terrible. I use a railway rifle because that‚Äôs about my speed. And the vampire gauss. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I could give it to you. I use VATS almost exclusively to fire so I can‚Äôt ever use automatic, machine or mini-guns. I keep them because maybe someone will want them. I have a ton of scrip because ... I never like what I get and sell everything.
---
I only have 2 perks these days in Luck that i rotate,Starched Genes + Super Duper.
---
Perk points are better spent in making a more optimized build IMO.
---
Being a bloodied  Commando/Sniper. i have a lot of points in maximizing damage output per shot.
---
I am able to swap my build to Tank/Heavy Gunner,Commando or Rifleman.
---
I just didn't see any real benefits in needing much Luck when i am already maxed out in Rifleman/ Commando/Heavy gunner,throw in Tank,Adrenaline and  covert operative i hit hard .If i want more damage Chems and Bobbleheads.
---
I'll second this
---
So say I use 9 heavy gunner perks, what you are saying is that I'm best just equipping the 1st rank of each one? Does the same apply to tenderiser and bloodu mess as well?
---
The elders battlecoat or whatever its called? Elder Maxums coat. Yeah that is easily my most desired outfit and it had to be an atomic shop item üò≠
---
Yea but in almost every case the bond will be maxed before you finish the ops, and the bonus only effects the exp from finishing it, soooooo... Not the best excuse.
---
Yeah guys. Stop talking about Fallout stuff in a Fallout sub!
---
Wait, so they‚Äôre going to be using your XBox *and* using your account?
---
Do you have GamePass?  Because nothing stops them from redownloading it, for example. 
---
And I don‚Äôt think you can have the same account actively signed on on two XBoxs at a time. Meaning while they‚Äôre playing, you can‚Äôt. 
---
Best solution is just to have your dad make a new account, and change the add word to yours. No need to delete FO76 from the console.
---
I'm on PlayStation and PC sadly or I'd take you up on that offer
---
More like the exact same thing multiple times day but I get it if you are on the slower side..
---
Gotta put on some sneak mods on your armor.
---
The slower side of what?
---
I tried to solo this one and....fuck that noise.
---
No I hit 110 to players, around 1500 to pve, if I drug up even more 4 to 500 a hit on earle and sbq with a fire rate over 100. This is all after patch
---
i was hitting for almost 5k a hit drugged up to normal enemies and up to 1200 on the queen.
---
My melee build pre patch was hitting 30k a swing on queen and 128k to cars and such
---
Pvp ill use my main gun, or switch to a dragon and land 8 110s at the same time, or my bffr tesla, or my bffr gamma, or my be gatling plasma, I run unyielding sent ss with ap except 1 arm is life saving with wwr and ap refresh. Vats works with my gamma and so its 150 rads a bullet with a fire rate over 100. It outdamages any quantum pa set ive pvpd against.
---
Also be ready for unexpected kindness. This game has one of the most altruistic communities I‚Äôve ever experienced. Be ready to pay the kindness forward to others.
---
Exactly
---
Welcome to the Wasteland! Like you I came from Oblivion to Skyrim to FO4, and now having an awesome time with my first "mmo".  You should check out r/pkoa, great group of folks over there.
---
Bethesda said there is upcoming hotfix that will address the issuers for level scaling in the mid-game. Or that Yao-Guai‚Äôs have a minimum level limit such as 30.
---
I don't get it. Please explain?
---
16 tones gets stuck in mine, I miss big iron and uranium fever .
---
I looked awhile back, but this is more than I thought was there.
---
I think this seriously hints towards the mole miners being related to vault 63, as they‚Äôve had this irrational hatred since before the dwellers showed up, and still seem to hate everyone else.
---
Or perhaps... they need someone‚Äôs help to find what they need. Something they can‚Äôt open because of their suits... and they need a surface dweller to help. Someone who can both see in the tunnels and listen to their pleas...
---
I don‚Äôt have any Nuka Grape, so you‚Äôd fuck me over pretty bad with that gamma gun. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre a heavy gunner? That‚Äôs the best way to deal with ass/sent like mine. Gamma gun.
---
He's calling you stupid
---
Ok I‚Äôm glad at least there‚Äôs some eyes on it. Because it‚Äôs weird that I would be walking around and I‚Äôd find a ton of level 6 scorched and then suddenly there‚Äôs a pack of level 35 wolves just up the road.
---
I don't understand
---
Can't cure dumb unfortunately. The loading screen tells you to play "musical instruments", which the drums are the only thing there remotely musical and Grahm says that you need to "Turn meat cooking spit". These people are too dumb to read and to dense to listen.
---
Makes sense thanks! I just went ahead and uninstalled. I feel like they‚Äôll be content with gta or fortnite honestly and not really go looking for fallout 76 thanks for the heads up!
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for a fallout with pirate themed battles from ships, fallout 4 had the uss constitution which was fun but lasted like 2 minutes. I want to broadside a murelurk queen!
---
Nope commando, but I'm using the legendary perks to give me all the heavy gunner perks I need. I also use the mag swap trick so my gamma and tesla both have 500 round mags.
---
If you haven't yet, try a plasma flamethrower. It melted the queen faster than my be gatling plasma the one time I tried it.
---
The map. I've always said Appalachia is one of my favourite video game worlds/regions along with Toussaint, Cyrodiil and Johto.
---
The OP is referring to you as slow, I.E. slow to learn, I.E. mentally deficient, I.E. unintelligent
---
Walrider Walrider Walrider *Walrider*
---
I can‚Äôt get the mag swap trick to consistently work... Or I‚Äôd use literally any FFR gamma gun.
---
Is there perhaps another way you could explain it? I'm a bit on the slower side
---
I want a Mole Miner expansion more than anything else tbh. They are easily the most interesting thing in 76 in my opinion.
---
One time a guy came over and bought everything in my store and all I could offer was some pipe guns
---
I love the idea of a pirate ship do you have any pictures?
---
Be prepared to be disappointed, take it from me, I have 1500 hours on this game lol
---
Try doing it with 5 bullets left in your gun then draining it. It will just take 5 off so you'd have a 495 clip
---
I might have some im on ps4
---
Nice! The game is a lot of fun but even better with friends. I say savor the story content as much as you can because there isn't any at end game. Also do the Mistress of Mystery quest line as soon as you can for some good gear and an amazing story. Good luck!
---

---
You're right. Must have read a comment speculating it being moved to 2021.
---
Nukashine
---
Well apparently I‚Äôm a huge boob....noticed today I somehow actually had the short handmade plans already, so made and scrapped some until I got it.
---
Wait I'm wrong.
---
Let's just hope no delay.
---
You can if they've got quest items in them, so in this case you can - same as project paradise with fragrant venison. Don't have to be in a team or the one that killed it.
---
Yeah, I have been having the best luck just soloing as well.
---
Also, the drums start giving that progress during the prep phase while you wait for the event to begin. When the event starts at tier 2, its because you had 3 drummers generating progress early.
---
Problem = People Post 
---
How will Beth ever know that folk AFKing is a real issue for many players if its forced in to silence?
---
No worries.
---
No you'll want to turn passive on.
---
There's a legendary perk that lets anyone initiate pvp without your consent.
---
Experience (looks at 4000 emc rounds from daily opps) I guess so
---
Yes, the best strat is to follow the team to the objective then all the enemies will come to you guys and you can fight them from there. It's not people trying to be a dicks but its literally timed and the point is to get on the objective and get it done.
---
The devs are asked a lot about expansion to Mole Miners lore and also the Mothman Cultists.
---
I wore an urban scout mask with it and it‚Äôs pretty cool
---
Try the Silver Shroud outfit, if you have it. I haven‚Äôt yet, but in my mind I think it might look interesting.
---
Shouldn't really be in a position on a computer game where someone is  being abused for anything tbh.
---
I've joined many-a-group like this. It's very annoying.
---
Would make a fun event at the least. I wish some of the weapons like the chainsaw and broadsider got some love so they‚Äôre not just novelties
---
Where do you activate those? I've only done communication and retirement
---
That's not even the what most are posting about its just them whining about people not joining the op instantly. I had someone cuss and stuff because my base was being attacked by a supermutant behemoth so I took literally 2mins to join so I could kill it and fix my walls
---
Have you tried quitting your day job?
---
38
---
Those are two different outfits. The Battlecoat and the Revolutinary War General‚Äôs Uniform. 
---
Both are really nice!
---
One of my Allies (Gramps) wears the Pint-Sized Slayer outfit and mask.
---
PING
---
My guy you are a ssg
---
Now that I agree with
---
Try renaming it. It's not idiot-proof but might help.
---
Need a NW gamemode that only gives you broadsiders and flintlock pistols
---
What the?????????? So anything in my stash can randomly just go on sale without my consent? I feel violated. Wow.
---
Yes. This exactly.
---
You just seem to be awful paranoid and also ignorant as to how the inventory steal method works.
---
Shotguns are kind of weak in the game right now.  People use the vats magic affect to get around it. Gauss shotgun is good though
---
This Reddit definitely helps keep me going. Every time I gripe about a noob issue, the response is always a ‚Äúamen guy, we‚Äôve all been there... try this; avoid that‚Äù . It is appreciated.
---
Having people at the drums and spits make the event easier for the ones doing chores.
---
The deathclaw mask from fasnacht if you have it.
---
Because if you go on drums or spits, you'll get booted after a period of time.
---
My thoughts are everyone you speak to pretty much wouldn‚Äôt be from the area. As that area got nuked. So it fits they would be from outside the area
---
Pirates are the future. 
---
I currently have a wicked anti-Blood Eagle Broadsider awaiting scripping - Assassins, Faster Reload, +33% Vats...could be fun...for me, maybe not so much my team
---
Fallout first and unspent atoms do not transfer between clients
---
So... then craft your own?  You have to have found some level appropriate gear at some point. It‚Äôs not all max level, is it?
---
Found it. Some blood eagles. Very pretty area. Still having trouble setting camp for enough water?   :( ill try what you said again.
---
The assaultron probably overrided its defence protocols after 210 years after the bombs fell.
---
 And commited to suicide through water.
---
You‚Äôd think at least the canons from the graveyard memorial could be craftable in camps
---
I am going to make a post soon with multiple images. Just making some final tweaks. I will reply to this again to let you know I made the post.
---
... i cant make the weapons im finding
---
Damnit:/ guess that sexy pic of the commander is gone
---
What platform are you on?
---
Ps4
---
You mean porn or t h i c c n e s s mods?
---
Add me mintberrychamp if you want a a shat load of plans
---
Won‚Äôt that remove the headpiece? I‚Äôm trying to wear the full outfit plus a mask to go with it. I believe The fasnacht masks act as helmets you can‚Äôt wear anything over them
---
Ohio River adventures for both. Turn meat into blackeye. Protect quest is from an npc at the back camp structure. I think his name is bones.
---
Try quiting game and trying again.
---
You don't need the codes btw.
---
Nukacrypt.com always has the weekly codes.
---
No, everything is in order. It's weird that you cant activate the elevator, never happened to me before. Have you tried server hopping? Or maybe someone recently launched from that silo?
---
The Communist spy and the Red viper fatigues.
---
Maybe there is a legal reason. The creation club content was made by individual modders who signed a contract with Bethesda. Perhaps the contract they signed specified that the mods would only be used for Fallout 4. So to use those mods, Bethesda would then have to renegotiate with those modders for each individual mods and have them sign a new contract. Plus there is the effort of converting those mods to FO76. 
---
This is just speculation based on how I understood the creation club to work.
---
Oh you're right I misread the question.
---
I've done a few solo, but I get lost in the maze a lot and can only get the second tier.
---
Rule34
---
If I had to guess, it would have to be for legal reasons. 
---
I guess the small skeleton crew of devs working on 76 can't just reach into Fallout 4 and just port the CC content. 
---
They probably have to go through the higher ups and a long process of working with the modders again just to port one thing.
---
I'm in the same boat. I want the Manwell rifle on 76.
---
Thank you, I will try restarting
---
Did you ever get a resolution to this?
---
I was lucky enough on my first run that the entire team join the Daily Op. But I guess I can't be that lucky every time.
---
Good idea, but my guess it wont be an option off bat. Itll probably take a ton of these posts before they realize they should have. Upvote for traction! üëç
---
Where can i find Polly?
---
Then don't join a group.leave.or do it your damn self.
---
Fuq outta with your barking little puppy.gfys.you don't dictate how people play or want to play the game.things change.you don't like it leave.this is why i do everything solo.
---
Pacifist*
---
Well, this sucks. Thanks anyway.
---
According to the wiki there‚Äôs a number of cut quests (including one for the Settlers to do with Sunny). It would be great if they could switch those on to give a bit more variety, though I imagine there are reasons as to why they were never made available. 
---
There‚Äôs also the event where you run for president which has never been switched on (though it is pvp I believe which is possibly why).
---
Yeah I‚Äôm the king of 10 cap bounties but lately it‚Äôs been these level 400+ guys and I‚Äôm afraid of clowning myself lol
---
The best thing I ever got from one was the flamer mod for the Enclave plasma rifle. It's just collecting dust in my stash, hoping that one day that rifle can be legendary...
---
Everyone experiences it differently, so no don't take it from anyone, least of all this negative nancy.
---
Haha
---
Really? Are you a lower level? My Op build is pretty much just excavator and a gauss minigun have not had any difficulties with any of the ops. Resilient just means I have to bash them when they get close after hosing them with gauss.
---
Thank you, there was a nuke either inbound or already impacted, maybe it was in a temp lockdown. I'll try restarting
---
Yeah, i was wondering if they were worth grinding out or not
---
Before I went bloodied we'd run rank 3 ghoulish and the charisma one that takes away rads in a team if one person shares rank 2 of the charisma card you'll never need radaway and barely use stimpacks in nuke zones.
---
I‚Äôve noticed if someone launches a nuke in silo you‚Äôre at right before you go in it won‚Äôt let you but fast travel to one of the other solos and it worked for me. Like it‚Äôs in a cool down moment. Robots need to build another nuke. Lol.
---
You have to realize this game is shit, the amount of bugs and nothing to do, with a poor and boring ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù. Fallout 76 is terrible, yet we still play it
---
Wish I had that lol
---
I'm also on #TeamOverEncumbered.
---
Already did that, too late though...
---
I genuinely hope Bethesda makes IRL merch for these peeps too
---
If 180ish items is what you need to force respawn what you need, what is a great place to farm a ton of random junk? I tend to do Helvetia but it Isn‚Äôt enough to just go there.
---
I can hear them saying ‚Äúscream you piece of shit‚Äù creepy!
---
Yesterday I had one idiot that kept leaving the zone.  Luckily another guy joined us on the second uplink to make up for it.  But still barely got Elder with 5 seconds to spare because I was the only one capping for the first uplink.
---
Ill have to try that
---
Video tour?
---
Edit: found it lower down :D
---
Do you have blocker, serendipity, etc cards to help. There are more but I'm having a brain fart. Also do you have emergency protocols on your power armor. You play bloodied, you need to perk accordingly.
---
I remember in the area underneath the river gorge bridge there‚Äôs a little girl whos sad about her dog that was killed a mole rat.
---
It worked!
---
Thank you mate üëç
---
It worked :)
---
I run sh not t65 but with emergency protocols I‚Äôm tanky af. I go in somewhere between 15/19 health and find myself using around 4/5 stims. Only perk that helps with dr in pa is dodgy. But dodgy and emergency protocols combined you‚Äôre a tank.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F91m-K5QsA8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F91m-K5QsA8)
---
Also, try a different silo if that helps. A nice tip if you also didnt know, you dont need the code pieces off the officers to nuke. Whenever I nuke now, I just look up this weeks codes, so all I need is a keycard
---
Yay! Tip: sleep in your room before leaving - for like 30-60 seconds until you get notified that you‚Äôre rested or well-rested - and you get a 5% XP boost right out of the vault. 
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
It was probably this, I restarted and now it worked. Thanks
---
Do you have emergency protocols on your chest piece? It's 40% damage reduction below 20% health.
---
hey I modeled my character after abe aswell
---
Was hoping next gen consoles would run the game at 60 FPS.
---
That too!
---
try to use emergency protocols or right low hp pa build, i'm not even dying in excavator pa
---
Serendipity doesn't work in Power Armor, despite it's description not saying it.
---
My bad, I think I was tired, lol but it got me to upload a video on the subject which still helps.
---
While workshops are pvp zones, half the players that I see show up are actually there to help anyway.
---
Okay, hopefully a PS4 player will be bale to help. I have a set of level 20 gear I crafted for my alts but since my lowest level alt just hit 30 I was ready to hand it down to a newer player anyways. 
---
If you are lucky and someone is willing/able to craft for you, I recommend:
---
- Heavy BoS Combat Chest w/ Dense
---
- Heavy Studded Leather Arms w/ Stabilized or Weighted (depending on if you‚Äôre Ranged or Melee)
---
- Heavy Polished Metal Legs w/ Ultra-Light Build
---
- Fixer modded for .38 ammo
---
- Spiked Ski Sword or Sacrificial Blade Machete
---
I've been keeping my Hunters coat raider skull mask combo since July. Dont know why but it's my fave (that,and my coat is +2 STR). Otherwise I run with the insurgents outfit.
---
Yes, I have all the right mitigation perks, missing emergency protocols though.
---
Okay but still there are other cards that help with bloodied builds surviving. I just couldnt remember them all off hand.
---
Its like Bethesda doesn‚Äôt even bother to learn from other online games like Elder Scrolls that does this well.
---
Yes forgot about dodgy. That+protocols+AP refresh from rejuvenated and action boy/girl makes you tanky af.
---
Sometimes it just does this. But usually the issue is that the silo is on cooldown, you have to wait 3 hours before anyone can launch at that silo again. You can check this on a holotape called Missile Silo State in your inventory, you should have gotten it from Modus or you get it after you drop your first nuke I don't remember. Or just hop servers and you should find one, people haven't been dropping as many nukes lately with Meat Week up.
---
I do not, probably should grab it.
---
The Gutter is a 1hd Assaultron blade with a special paint and does more damage than the normal version.    
---
You also need Makeshift Warrior (INT) R5 and two Legendary mods per craft among other materials. My first roll was a 1 star and my character isn't a melee character. You can't sell it but can you give it away?
---
Joining minutes late for any reason pretty much equates to AFK as far as your team members are concerned. Teams should be instanced rather than set 4 man teams where people often take an age to join, if ever, even after hanging around in the entry area for minutes. You ma well have been defending your Camp, but player X may just use the excuse in order to jump on late getting rewards for zero effort.
---
Though those dropped from Savage Divide events now and not the enclave anymore?
---
Those no longer drop from enclave events, can only be found as a rare reward from savage divide events, mr. messenger no matter where it spawns also counts as a savage divide event.
---
I just dumped mine since I now have plans to make one if needed.  (I won't ever need to)
---
An underground mineshaft city would be my absolute dream. The Burrows is one of my favourite spots in the game similar to that
---
Have never played on steam but this same thing used to happen through the Beth launcher. Just closing and relaunching again fixed it.
---
They've actually used quite a few creation club items so far.
---
Seems to be the go to for when a quest doesn't work In this game haha.
---
I almost said vendor but didn't want to cause confusion. 
---
There are a few things called "vendor" in game. 
---
Robots - at train stations, you can buy and sell. Some things can't be sold, like bullets.
---
Player Vendors - at player camps, you can only buy, unless they're yours, then you can only sell. 
---
Vending machines - marked medical or ammo and found at train stations. You can only buy, prices are outrageous and AFAIK no one ever uses them. 
---
I sell stims to robot vendors at train stations.
---
If you are on the fence , don't renew. Stuff the scrap box with what you can.  Wait a couple months to see where the game is at,  then make a decision.
---
Someone probably launched from that silo in the last hour, just switch silo.
---
I found a West Virginian to team up with and have a couch on my porch. Immersion complete!
---
That's a cool change! Makes Night Eyes or nv scopes slightly more viable
---
I know... not sure why it did that and don't know how to delete it
---
Nope, level 280. Im a Bloodied Build. Ive got all kinds of weapons including a BE Laser Rifle, BE Gat Plas, BE Tesla, etc. 
---
Full Unyeilding SS armor. Even if I removed my Rads they still just destroy me so much faster than any other daily ops enemies
---
Thank you. Wish I knew those before I was almost maxed lol
---
I‚Äôm guilty only because after I‚Äôm done with ops I forget to hop when I went to do other things like score dailies. It‚Äôs not til I see someone‚Äôs starting another one, then someone else joined him that I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell hell... guess I should help out. It‚Äôs eight min or less of my time‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs called zero sum. And capitalism is basically founded on it.
---
Wild idea, what if we just had corpses despawn on death leaving a standard enemy loot bag(maybe a vault-tec lunchbox or something) behind? Maybe even give them an audio or visual cue to help find them. 
---
And for events, Queen, and Earl, have one large Vault-Tec crate spawn with all your loot from the event and the creatures you killed during it. Sort of like getting the chest at the end of a Destiny 2 strike.
---
Ah shit. Everytime I see or hear a GoT quote it makes me want to rewatch it again. Why have you done this to me
---
They weren't even in the op yet, not too mention I killed everything anyway then when I got the elder for them pretty much he sent me the message
---
Yep exactly. I don‚Äôt even notice I‚Äôm low health on my bloodied pa.
---
Broadsider is a pretty fun weapon now but durability is awfully low
---
As a bloodied build,  i just  run rull heath and pull out a vampire heavy.  Pick an open team and run with randos. My times are always under 8 mins. With a decent weapon and your awareness,  build really don't matter in a team of 4. After the OP i just go to toxic water and take a bath.
---
The home screen as in not the map screen x
---
Where did you read they fixed teslas? Someone was using one in my daily op yesterday on Xbox and the area he was shooting was like 3fps, but walking outside that area the fps were fine.
---
The same area caused no lag on a different op with no tesla user.
---
For bones you have to go through some dialog to get him to give you the mini event daily. You can get the option to ask him something others question and then you can ask him if he has any tasks or jobs to do.
---
Sorry! I should have mentioned that it's high level players that are the major culprits!! üòÇ.  Totally understandable for newer players to be confused. Heck, in some events I'm totally lost, even now!
---
I have had the complete opposite experience and I've played since launch. I recommended the game all the time since then. Maybe you are expecting something more than what it is and therefore just not enjoying it. In that case the problem isn't the game.
---
To me, it‚Äôs a lot like No Mans Sky. Really fun, love the concept, sad about how much more it could be but always brings me back.
---
New players aren't the problem. We ALL were new players &amp; know how confusing all this can be. üôÇ
---
Needed to blow the atoms on something so I jumped a few ahead. There just isn't much in the atom shop that I've wanted in a while.
---
Thanks, will do! :)
---
My Stealth VATS Rifleman carries a reduced weight Gatling Plasma and 4-6 cores.  Weight around 5lbs. total.  I get to loot every time.
---
Thanks! It's looking much better now yeah. :)
---
Jesus food builds saying this game is good üòÇ
---
2 days a go i was at Grafton steel mill  and i im a lvl 100 even and i was  in a  weapons bench and had a lvl 204  beat me to death with boxing gloves  then leave .
---
Thanks for letting me know. Will do!
---
Yep me (148) and my friend (137) had a level 9 join our op and it went fine. He might've chugged a lot of stimpaks but he stayed near the beacon and that's what matters.
---
Where are you getting the 300 damage number from
---
 Both really, they kinda go hand in hand
---
Stuff you can do: 
---
1) build lots of water purifiers for caps
---
2) build your camp on a resource deposit for free stuff like junk 
---
3) look up the pioneer scouts quest for a bigger backpack (it takes a while)
---
5) get 5 intelligence to swap out all the crafting cards
---
6) get the starched genes perk for mutations. Speed demon, adrenaline reaction and marsupial are great and can be bought from players
---
7) look up the excavator armor
---
8) when you run out of screws, tag them in the crafting interface
---
Have you tried eating 20 "satco" tacos?
---
Felt that..
---
I still wouldn't trade under that system. I simply don't trust people I don't know.
---
Mental math, I looked at how many damage instances i did to the mob and just add em up.
---
Or you could do collision course.
---
I like to stand outside vault 76 and drop a rocket heated baseball bat, 10 stims, 10 radical, and 10 purified water. The number of people that run the moment they see me is staggering. Ive resorted to chasing them down while talking in game chat. I tell the to relax, I'm here to help, and pick up this paper bag. Its always funny to imagine what they must be thinking while I'm chasing them down the mountain calling to them lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôve lost a bunch and luckily found some. It‚Äôs annoying
---
Oxhorn has a video on how you can find one

I get bizarre numbers per pellet on my gauss shotgun.üòÅ not bloodied though. Supposed to do 580-ish damage per shot fully charged but don't think the numbers add up to it. I get like 3, 6, 7 27, 110,5,8,5,7 ... all over.üòÄüòÄ
---
Oh you just need to try again
---
Ahhh. It was listed in the most recent patch notes. I haven‚Äôt noticed the lag since, but if you‚Äôve experienced it then maybe something is still wrong.
---
I don‚Äôt mind mods as long as they stay cosmetic but the people who want the mods wants more then that. They want stuff in the game that doesn‚Äôt belong or guns that deal over a million plus.
---
This would ruin the game due to its always online and can screw normal players over.
---
If they made a separate map for modders that does not affect the normal game then I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
But why bother? If you want mods just keep playing fallout 4 or 3. There‚Äôs enough mods there. Don‚Äôt need them in 76.
---
Go ahead and do it, especially since you usually need to do one for the scoreboard daily. Just make sure to stay with the group and stand with the uplinks (it makes them go faster).
---
You‚Äôre gonna have some nightmares that you just can‚Äôt shake! Ya just can‚Äôt shake em!!
---
Would love to help you out! PSN: OrganicPinepple
---
Thanks for the advice! I'm sure prior Bethesda RPG knowledge will help a bit. I'll only loot valuable and high-level stuff. Looting everything early-game was quite a waste of time in Skyrim &gt;\_&lt;
---
For many enemies the head is still a weak point.    
---
My 2nd char is a Shotgunner. There aren't many options though.    
---
The 2 Barrel is the hardest with pump action, and combat shotguns being the next in damage. Higher damage = low fire rate. Want higher fire rate = lower damage.     
---
I have a Legendary version of each.    
---
I've learned a Shotgunner has to shoot and move(repeat) a lot more than my Stealth Sniper. Enforcer R3 (AGI) in VATS can ensure crippling of a limb roughly 88% of the time. My Combat Shotgun is an Explosive one.    
---
I'm used to my Sniper who does damage at long ranges where the 2nd has to get a lot closer to do significant damage. IMO, here you would need a mix of armor to get the highest DR and ER you can while it doesn't take up a lot of weight. One Wasteland is still new so learning how build work in the long-run doesn't exist yet.    
---
IMO, an established character who's 50+ is not the same as a Shotgun build at level 2 after the update.
---
I'm simply creating a new group myself and wait for 2 or 3 minutes. If someone else is interested in doing DailyOps they'll join if not then I'll do it myself, depending on the type of enemy and mutation I can reach Elder rank on my own with little trouble...
---
Or turn in pleasant valley claim tickets
---
You must have some fantastic vision then. When my Gauss shotgun hits, all the numbers overlap and there's no way to know how much damage I'm doing
---
Thanks to both of you
---
I always thought they were kinda funny and strangely cute with their lil mumbles and grumbles but now...well shit.
---
I'm someone who liked Anthem. So my bar is pretty low. I usually find a way to enjoy everything. :)
---
This is the 1 thing that will have the most impact.
---
Dodgy perk would be the next best option, tied with lone wanderer if u solo.
---
Modus should be more generous. Maybe drop a few strike beacons and mutation recipes? Beth, are you listening???üòé
---
Bloodied melee with 20ish bss melee weapons hanging out in stash since nerf. Thing is, since they made the change I am slowly adjusting my play style since I'm a flexible person that tries to overcome the challenges given to me rather than getting on the internet to cry about them. Oh and I also have a meta stealth commando, but the melee is more fun to play.
---
Well my comments were based of my own experiences.My main is two handed melee PA.I get staggered infrequently and I stagger more frequently.The no damage bug on occasion is annoying I give you that.
---
Due to the nature of melee I have to close in to do my damage.Once I get there or they get to me I one shot everything except some legendaries and beefier enemies.My power attacks don‚Äôt seem to be effected by the miss/no damage bug.
---
Of course ranged is going to have a big advantage over melee and of course ranged bloodied is going to be even better and safer.
---
If you allow a stagger immunity mechanic in the game for players you might as well not even bother having melee enemies at all.You could just take blocker and anti stagger and negate most of the threat they pose.
---
I just get tired of people wanting nerfs or immunity to things when something gives them trouble.You figure out how to deal with them.You adjust you adapt and you overcome.
---
Sweet! Good to know :)
---
There's an option under a comment.  By clicking on the 3 dots
---
There is definitely the case being made for both sides. 
---
Such low damage now means the perks don‚Äôt add as much. So what is the big deal if you don‚Äôt get all and get some qol perks instead. 
---
Alternatively, the damage is now so low that every little bit counts no matter how much the investment is.
---
I get it, but then go in solo to do that. I don‚Äôt farm ammo in it being I maxed out legendary perk for ammo. But I get not every one did that, but again they should go in solo or get on a team that wants to do just that
---

calibrated shocks from a modus terminal
---
Wild , theyre always empty if i didnt kill them .. on xbox . I dunno.
---
Ooh! Idea: we also get a raider boss named Banjo Jojo, who uses a banjo sword!
---
Woah. Thanks for all the messages! I haven't even started playing yet. But seeing everyone here really makes me excited about the game and it's community. 
---
Thanks everyone! &lt;3   
---
And as I said before, feel free to add me on PSN: Jaina34

---
Blocker and emergency protocols are your friends.
---
Specifically, it's from their script notes in the files, which match to the in-game audio.
---
I could be wrong but I think they didn‚Äôt have that this season because it might have been one of the things making the board really laggy in the first season
---
Enclave items seem to be the unloved child, especially as all the fuss atm is about the PoS BoS. I pick up the occasional Enclave Plasma but never seen a Legendary, and mods aren't exactly falling from the sky.
---
Thank you very much ! (:
---
Now that I know you can join the server and not have to rebuild your camp, I've seen this too. That and camps that were close, but hardly seemed like there was overlap
---
The fact that they don't get reduced weight from ordnance express makes it hard for me to justify carrying them around.
---
They are notorious for saying they've patched something yet it still happens.
---
Hope this was just a one off as that tesla lag was brutal. First Colossal Problem I did was like 0-1fps because of it.
---
Bethesda has ignored the pvp community for 2 years. I think I can complain about the countless bugs and glitches they need to fix, but there‚Äôre  to lazy, they‚Äôll but battle passes and new camp walls instead of fixing their damn game. Bethesda is in it for the money and nothing else
---
I have a bloodied explosive gauss shotgun I got from the ally weapon case mission. Damage number says 350, but it just tickles the enemies.
---
The thing is, no matter what new team mode they add, it doesn‚Äôt mean all players in the team will go and do that. 
---
Which is why often players just join the casual team. So the extra intelligence means they get extra experience for everything they do while they play. 
---
Instead of getting extra experience only for when they do events, kill legendary enemies, etc. 
---
If you want to run nuke silos, then get some friends and make a casual team so you get extra experience for killing the robots, healing your friends etc. 
---
But even if they added a ‚Äúnuke team‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt mean every player will use all their nuclear key cards and ammo just to keep launching nukes.
---
Fair enough, and an easy mistake to make on both sides, with beth doctoring dates and amount in silence :)
---
Plan hunting, camp building, gear improvement and doing the harder events.
---
Don't tell us what to do. Sometimes there is ONLY daily ops teams and we just want the inspirational and strange in numbers bonuses.
---
Try getting your hands on some Vampire heavy weapon (Gatling Plasma/Laser, Minigun or whatever) and if the mutation is resilient then simply finish them with any melee weapon after bringing them down...Since getting that Vampire Gatling Plasma a few days back I haven't used any Stimpaks in DailyOps and solo'd quite a few of them on Elder rank as so far no enemy could deal more damage than I get back
---
Yep. It‚Äôs not that they aren‚Äôt being used, it‚Äôs that they are slowly being thrown into the atom store. This allows Bethesda to keep refreshing the items in the store without actually paying for new content to be made. They don‚Äôt need to pay the original content creators again as Bethesda our right owns those items.
---
I did not know that. Thank you.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to leave the uplink area. You don‚Äôt actually have to finish killing things. Just let them come to you, line of sight them and they‚Äôll walk in further. If they don‚Äôt, just leave them and finish them when the op is over.
---
End game for me is gaining as much levels as possible, gathering all plans, and collecting god roll weapons. I like doing the season scoreboard, and then hopping around camps to see what they have on sale.
---
Usually found at the Production terminal, but always check the War Room terminal too.
---
I'm wondering why they don't just add one here as well and let modders make outfits and skins too. It's not like it could hurt their profits.
---
This is what i do. That way i can have it set to casual while killing mobs, and switch to events right before they end for the bonus xp. Then switch back. It's been really nice for doing prime cuts.
---
I don‚Äôt use power armor. But my ‚Äúdamage reduction‚Äù perks are
---
Refractor. 
---
Fireproof 
---
Ironclad and 
---
Evasive 
---
With a full set of secret service and my armor plated backpack. I can run around west tek and nuke silos without going down.  Occasional
---
Stimpack here and there, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm getting shot and killed with 1-2 shots.
---
I wonder if the free radicals mask works. There's also a gas mask or two that would work well with it. Also if you have a legacy vault 94 mask it doesn't have the plants on it. The ones with plants would look bizarre.
---
If you tell new players to turn on "passive" they send you to the shrink. It's PACIFIST.
---
And it's the opposite, when in a team and you have "take one for the team" but are not set to pacifist, YOU are killable to all.
---
Edit: Considering that that perk is only available at lvl 50, players should have had ample time to get to know PvP and should know to set pacifist active.
---
It's pretty entertaining, the ones that get scared and run are the highlight of my day. Lol. Especially when they eventually show up and admit they were scared. Lol
---
1) turn on pacifist
---
2) your understanding of the bug is wrong. The pvper does not need take one for the team. The victim has to have it.
---
Weight Watchers
---
Myself also.
---
If he doesnt use the banjo sword I'll break my disc in half
---
I got those same plans in one run last night. It still rolls all the rewards so you don‚Äôt really have to do them separately.
---
Do you need new pieces?
---
Yes, true. Although I've had good luck with the daily ops teams, and usually elder rank from the first run. So I really believe it would get more nukes launched.
---
Why don't you just do the monthly subscription? Cancel it for the following month then do it on an ad-hoc basis.
---
I run with a vampire FFR heavy gun on my bloodied build, which really helps when serendipity decides not to proc.
---
Impatient motherfuckers mainly. Screw those millenials.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been patched or not, but if you find a legendary enemy. Damage it. Let it kill you. Damage it again. Let it kill you. Damage it again and then kill it. When you loot it, the enemy will drop 3 legendary items. 
---
I used to do this before wastelanders, I would server hop until the bear in the cave by whitespring would become a legendary. I‚Äôd only do it 3 times because I was afraid there was a limit. When I was ready to kill the bear I‚Äôd run towards the whitespring robots and have them help me kill the bear.
---
Shit like this is what makes creating a daily ops team such an obnoxious task, I hate the players who rip me out of whatever I‚Äôm doing, bitching and moaning because me and two other randos weren‚Äôt itching to go after running a couple ops back to back. If it‚Äôs so important start up your own team and just wait for people to join, you‚Äôll wait no more than a couple minutes before you get people to join. Sometimes even people from other daily ops teams will drop everything and join. It‚Äôs fun but not ‚Äúlets jump RIGHT back into this a billion times‚Äù fun
---
Good point and it is stuffed now, just don't won't to throw money away on a broke game.
---
And play directly into the hands of trap-camp builder? 
---
Not going to happen.
---
Got a quad 25/25 broadsider from mama today... pirates, ahoy!
---
Because rule 10 keeps you from asking Bethesda for it. 
---
We all agree it should be there. Maybe at some time we will have it but probably not soon.
---
With patch 22, pistols now benefit from the tank killer perc. They now have armor penetration and do more damage
---
I think if they just moved mort and the gold press to outside the core, you could have the same effect, without the double fast travel spots.
---
I was shooting without VATS, so the numbers aren't that jumbled up.
---
I doubt it would take that muh work to convert them, 76 uses quite a bit of fo4 to run. I agree with the legal reasons tho, that seems like it would be too much work to even attempt
---
Yes, people complaining about the change need to adapt and change up their build and/or gear. My characters did "suffer" as a result of the change, BUT, I'm choosing to adapt and rework their builds and gear instead of bitching about it nonstop. :)
---
Hi to a fellow female gamer! I‚Äôm Xbox also. 
---
You sound like me. I don‚Äôt use a mic, it just makes me nervous! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve had good experiences, I have to say, apart from a couple of weird stalkers on odd sessions this community is awesome. People are so friendly, more than in any other gaming community I think.
---
that's crazy, i remember bloodied gauss shotgun just one hitting level 50 ghouls before the update
---
*ill drag you to hell!"
---
Bruh im just tryna get some lead üò© üòí
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
I'd say 90% do. This game doesn't have much appeal outside the us.
---
Some of the GTA RD2 Online aholes must have made their ways to the Wasteland ü§®ü§î
---
Honestly I just end up soloing the daily ops.
---
I tend to take extra long at a vendor if someone distracts me like that... Can't help it, oops.
---
Some maybe trying to see if you have Take one for the team and can grief you in PVP
---
Thanks la3rat you're always good for info ;) I'm gonna keep my commando the same but gotta admit tempted on my heavygunner those points could go into blocker or more weight reduction
---
A lot of people expect vendors to be for ‚Äúgiving away‚Äù items instead of actually creating an economy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think helping players is important but I had a guy get mad at me for selling fusion cores for 25 caps.
---
Maybe you are talking about the z-generation or post-millennials...
---
Maybe they want new stuff over all the old stuff. The old stuff is good. But I prefer new stuff first.
---
I agree, no one likes getting their ass kicked especially by glowing hamsters.
---
I have 2 max dmg perk cards and one perk set at 1 star and put in a utility card. 
---
Damage perks matters a lot but stacking them like crazy is not.
---
On the plus side nerd rage is still multiplicative so that‚Äôs a must have if your bloody.
---
üòÅüëç
---
If you‚Äôre the team leader you can switch the goal of the team. Which I always try to do after completing an op.
---
They probably forgot to take their ritalin before logging on.  Little spazzes with trigger fingers.....
---
we assuming the blue suits are the dwellers
---
I also wanna add. Dont have your team public if youre going to kick everybody who joins. The amount of times ive been kicked from teams, that are public and not full, is too damn high.
---
If it didn't take so damn long to get gold I wouldn't mind it but it's fucking painful not being able to buy more than once a week and then just 200 from notes a day. Shit just drags on and it's so annoying. I haven't played for a super long time so I barely have any of it unlocked and I've been trying to get a shit ton of bullion but there's only like 2 ways to get it that are heavily limited lmao.
---
No I mean train vendors. Can‚Äôt sell to them.
---
Honestly I could see the defender making its way in as a new weapon. Would be nice for pistol builds ngl
---
Yah at one where i was actually browsing i just waited even longer
---
No I mean train stations: I‚Äôm never given the option to sell
---
What if what they're digging for is that face thing from Fallout 4
---
You are defending a lack of text chat in game because you don't think other people playing the game speak the same language? Get outta here
---
Sometimes my gauss shotguns do not do damage and sometimes they one shot or nearly one shot enemies they shouldn't.  Hell, I've even had some mobs gain health after shooting them recently.  Pre patch 22 I managed to get the damage numbers of my bloodied gauss shotguns over 2k damage, but I had way too many instances of no damage being done and then being one shot by the mob I was trying to kill that I switched back to combat shotguns for most things.   I've been running daily ops in PA with my vampires gauss shotgun and the numbers are all over the board.  I can usually 1-2 shot most enemies with it and then it can take 9 shots to kill the next one.  At least since it is vampires it keeps me from dying.  Unfortunately, weapons with charge times are extremely buggy in this game.
---
My favorite part is that you can jump off a 1000 foot high tower and not die
---
Ah ok I‚Äôve heard that mentioned, how does it work?  Just so I don‚Äôt initiate anything..
---
Great feature, but not everyone plays on PC. Some of us like playing on console for the controller in our hands and the lack of blood thirsty hackers.
---
You'll probably say, "but you can type on console". It takes forever to type on PS4, probably the same with Xbox. We would need a separate companion app for text chat to make it usable.
---
I just wish legendary creatures were tagged, like how destiny 2 lets you know there‚Äôs a wanted enemy nearby, there should be a pop-up in the upper right hand corner that‚Äôs like ‚Äúa legendary creature is nearby!‚Äù with either a large marker or a single point showing us where it is ESP after it dies.
---
What category is the foosball table under
---
So mumbles doesn't actually mumble
---
Are you on PS4? I can do them.
---
Exploding anything, galleria is the easiest to navigate
---
I believe the way it works is you take largely reduced damage until you attack back.
---
Lol, the walk of shame
---
I like farming events for XP and legendaries, although I go scrip 95% of my drops because they're terrible. I get the majority of my good stuff either via trades or when someone gifts it to me. It's just fun to do shooty bang bang tings with hordes of ghouls on my bloodied build for added challenge. ;)
---
This.... especially as it's an easy fix.
---
All you do is open the trade menu with the vendor and switch to your inventory and select the item you want to sell. Works exactly like buying. Strange that it just wouldn't work
---
If you have pacifist off and have take one for the team, it basically triggers the PVP since when you target that person, the perk returns a target to increase the damage, basically meaning you accept PVP. There may be more to it, I haven‚Äôt been using the perk so i don‚Äôt know the full details
---
I found it far more worthwhile to just have 5* Adrenaline and three base 1* +10% damage perk cards; I'm not wanting for damage as a anti-armor heavy weapons user with this setup and have tons of slot for QoL.
---
In Fallout 4 the gauss weapon was my favorite.. I love my gauss shotgun but am a little confused about the damage ir is supposed to deal... maybe I just need to get closer to the targetsü§ìüôÑü§îü§î
---
Yeah, I've gone through the same while reading their lore a while back. It's a shame this dialogue doesn't show up on the subtitles because I can't hear any of this at all.
---
That‚Äôs possible although I‚Äôve been dropping my prices lately because I have an overflow
---
not to mention 95% VATS missing bug with this gun, probably will drop it after some testing.
---
If you buy the plan, each leg requires five violet flux.
---
This is exactly what I do. Just because you're a bloody build doesn't mean you can't dump some rads and use a non bloody weapon for stuff like daily ops. I'd rather do this than go to the trouble of changing a bunch of perk cards to make myself tankier at low health.
---
Ah ok.... I have pacifist on so I think I‚Äôm ok
---
Look at angry turtles new heavy build. It‚Äôs a nice balance of damage and qol. I don‚Äôt agree with all his choices but I have taken some of his ideas into my build.
---
as do I, but i do think it catches some by surprise
---
Wow. And all this time I assumed they just modified bear growls.
---
even in point blank vats seems to fail, idk prolly will stick to the good ol normal shotgun for now
---
I got legendaries,  especially in Watoga Dropped Connections.. nothing that really blew my mind thoughü§ì
---
Exploding and valley galleria. It‚Äôs small, so easy to get fast times. And I don‚Äôt get lost!
---
I don't care if people have them, but yeah annoying af to listen too. It can also cause my audio to stop working in game until I close and re-open it (not that frequently).
---
Shoot I found a guy who had free mutation serums in on vendor and in another had one of each that costed 15000 caps. Had no idea what was going on.
---
I shouldve probably done that, but it started downloading the files after I verified and couldn't play until it was done. 2 hours later, it's working again
---
Some of the enemies I‚Äôve killed in daily ops have turned into paper bags. It‚Äôs been very few of them, most still do meat piles, so it could well be a bug, but surely they could do it on purpose.
---
I'm glad someone was here to stick up for ice road truckers. Right on, man.
---
And if you join an Ops team, do the friggin' Op! Don't do 10 other things first...
---
Makes sense.
---
I'm pretty sure I've heard them say "Oh God. Oh God, it hurts!"
---
What games aren‚Äôt broken these days?  It seems to me anymore every game is broken in some way. Most of the brokenness of this game is manageable and known at least.
---
I'm not sure which location would be my favorite but the Burrows is a pain with how far away each objective is and how easy it is for new players to get lost. Vault 94 isn't bad, but I'm not a fan of some of the layout. The mines are easy to navigate, a little spread out, but it can be tough to see things properly, especially with cloaked enemies. The mall is incredibly simple, though easier access to the 2nd floor would be nice.
---
Favorite mutation would have to be "volatile". I usually always run fireproof(and sometimes dense) so it's nothing for me.
---
One lesson learned was to equip fireproof as my explosive shotgun kept killing me instead of the ghouls. I think the gauss acts as an explosive as well.
---
Oh you say you want mole rats with jet packs? Done.
---
Yea I dropped them down to 5 after he left because I don‚Äôt use power armor or Gatling lasers
---
What commitments? Lol, if you're that stubborn in your path... enjoy being angry...
---
Enlighten me, why is there a need to change the reset time or whatever? For me the daily op resets at around 9pm which means I get to do it a couple of times while it's all new and people want to do it (i find it hard to get a good team together a couple hours BEFORE the reset so)
---
The problem is that accent can be impossible to understand. It's some real honky shit if they're from the deep hills.
---
This. For the love of Chally if you're gonna be in an ops group do the frickin ops. I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting at the beginning area asking my teammates to come and none of them do. Plus, if you're waiting for the bond bar to fill up by the time you finish the op it will have so there's no reason not to join. Unless you're just one of those people.
---
I like the borrows. All the different types of mobs are cool. I like variety and challenge
---
If your a non vats user they're great for crowd control aim for the legs with enforcer and skeet shooter this is especially useful for enemies like the mirelurk queen, deathclaws, assaultron, etc. 
---
I mean I wish they had more damage but they're still really useful AA might be a good choice because they dont have an armor penetration perk.
---
I'm not doing it for the scrip, I'm doing it for the actual items. Every day, I go to the Purveyor, roll for one three star and one two star legendary, scrip my junk so I'm back at 1,000 scrip, then run Ops for legendaries, keeping the good ones and leaving the trash at train stations. I'm telling you, Ops are FANTASTIC for grinding legendary gear.
---
I stopped using displays personally. Not worth the budget and massive clutter on the top of my stash when I open it
---
I think its a must for a bloodied build anyway (the perk that is)
---
Now that the rewards w max level I am shredding those poor bastards.
---
They probably recently got the Master Infiltrator legendary perk and are still getting used to the fact that just pointing and clicking will auto-pick locks, even player locks. It‚Äôs easy to accidentally make yourself wanted that way. (In general, high level players normally can‚Äôt be bothered to go around picking player locks on purpose. They‚Äôre over it.)
---
Just bigger. Same speed would help cut down on commute times.
---
So actually I've done some testing of my own on a private server with some friends.  What I've found is that when theres an empty goo pile or ash pile, it means that someone else has loot on it.  The no loot is just that you didnt get a tag, and thus have no loot. 
---
They're kind of like corpses, except that corpses eventually despawn into client side only meat piles, and goo ash piles do not, and only disappear after a reset, or when theres nothing left.
---
Basically the goo/ash piles are there for everyone and only disappear when no one who has loot on them anymore.  Loot your piles.
---
I wasted so much gold bullion on the SS armor and mods and honestly it's just trash. My combat armor looks way better, has skins, and doesn't take an arm and a leg to mod.
---
Revive the dude, don't be like that, then murk off the settlers for messing with a fellow vault dweller, and drop him a bunch of free stuff
---
"Going to fucking kill you," ah it was this line that I knew the John Mole Miner was my favorite enemy type, obviously this line was followed by the oh so memorable death line, "ARAGHGAHRGALDSAHFGBKSFGAHSJFV." Beautiful stuff
---
Honestly the skull mask in atom shop is underwhelming. I wish I hadn‚Äôt bought it. It counts as a full face item so the bottom of your face still shows.
---
its the best build in the game as long as you always fire in VATS.  With my Q DB, almost every enemy is a one shot kill.  Larger creates are maybe 4 or 5 shots.  Since you fire so little and the bullets are cheap to make (or very easy to find) resources are something you don't have to worry about.  Load up on HP and walk around like a tank.  I like to joke that with my weapon I am the most feared creature in the wastelands.
---
Question completely unrelated to the post, time lol!  How do you like the T-65 pa and is it worth the investment?
---
I'd love that. Like little action figures of all the characters n shit. That would be an awesome collector's dream
---
this is my favorite thing to exist right now.
---
People with SSDs load in faster.
---
I do taunt, question, thumbs up, question. I hope it comes across as, "Wanna shoot things? Yeah?"
---
Same
---
SSD‚Äôs?
---
Rather do a year, don't like to mess with it every 30 days, plus cheaper. I did that with my PC toon at first, 2 mo and still living out of it.
---
Agreed! Really hoping that isn't just the delirium of radded-out former miners.

A reason to be digging &amp; living underground would make them so much cooler as a group of postapocalyptic survivors. Instead of just being tragic victims of the war &amp; inhuman labor conditions, they would've had a hand in becoming what they are now - presumably because they think something down there is worth it.
---
Yeah but like how is anyone supposed to communicate that? You can't seriously expect someone to make an ops team, hope that the people who show up want to farm ammo, and send a psn message to every single person who joins the team "hey I'm just farming ammo".
---
Daily Ops, like everything else in this game, has its place in each individual person's play style. Some do it casually, a handful of times a day while enjoying the rest of the game. Some people, like OP and everyone bitching the same way as them, are mad that people don't do Op after Op after Op.  *People play this game different ways* and if someone can't handle that, then maybe they shouldn't play the game. It's a *big* sandbox. You gotta learn to tolerate others. And if they aren't *actively trying* to make you miserable in the game (ie griefing, intentionally being an asshole, destroying your shit, etc), then just move on.
---
We literally do not need 4928391048 posts because people are pissy that not everyone plays Ops the way they do.

Exploding in Burning Mine. I find it just as easy as the Galleria and I think the exploding mutation fits the location

Anything but resilient robos in the Burroughs.

Thanks very much! Gonna be hard for me to top this one

I think more likely, they drew from a common core of "Things people in the 30's thought the future would be like". A distinct Mr Handy and Miss Nanny robot (As well as their general existence) are good examples. Versus modern "SciFi futures" which are closer to the MODUS, or Iron Man's JARVIS systems, where its just an entity that triggers devices, rather than a specific machine that floats about.

NW is much like Fortnite in that you start with nothing and have to find weapons. You also have to survive the storm encroaching onto you. The only gain you make from leveling are perk cards that affect your game play. Much like adventure mode, you can create a build. You can be a shotgun build, heavy build, etc.
---
When you start a match you're given a choice to join a team or go solo. When in the lobby (vault 51) you can vote on one or two maps. After time expiration you are forced to chose a location to spawn. You don't know where others are spawning but you can see where your team picks. It's wise to stay together. When the timer expires it shows what other players are around you. All the colors opposite your team colors are enemy. If you spawn next to or on top of an enemy you'll start the game either fighting or running.
---
Upon map loading your goal is to quickly find armor medic stuff and weapons. After this is achieved without dying your goal is to survive each cycle of the fire (storm) and don't let it absorb you. You can see the circles progression on the map. As the storm closes your job is to survive enemy fights. The last team standing wins overseer.
---
Some note worthy tips. Many players hide in bushes to avoid detection and get a jump on the enemy. Use cover as often as you can. Getting too ten gives you a placement xp bonus. Top three another one. Xp earned in NW does not count toward your legendary board game. Guns grenades and aid auto load into your weapon wheel. There are glitches here. Sometimes a weapon will stack onto another weapon in the same lot or it'll be blank. If blank go into pipboy and leave the wheel should be clear. Color weapons change depending on their power. Purple is good. You can also launch quick nukes in game so for radiation prevention find rad x rad away or/and a radiation suit.
---
PC has a hacker/exploiter problem. Auto aim software and other exploits used heavily. Don't be surprised if you're one shot killed with a pipe pistol from half way across the map.
---
If you have questions feel free to dm me or ask here.
---
Then don't whine when people wait to join the Op until the bond is full.
---
Yea but I saw a pic of it with that outfit and it blends with it really well so I‚Äôm hoping it comes back soon!
---
We need a "Will you kids stay off my damn lawn" emote.

What if after every Meat Cook event, Graham would trade Legends for scrip like mumbles,  maybe give him 50 scrip to trade with each participant.  Eh  I guess the no lifers would earn 1000 scrip in a day and the rest of us could clear out the stash from all the stuff waiting for mumbles daily refresh.  Oh Meat Cook could award you with a meal that you could deliver to mumbles to add 25 scrip to her inventory...I like that better.  Fasnaught could do the same with donuts or sausage or a mumbles mask to deliver.  Tie events together and all.
---
Lol 25 is an amazing price... 5 is crazy good.
---
Nick Valentine: *stares syntheticly*
---
Nopes
---
Wait so does that mean you unlock it on one character and you can use the rewards on any other character on the same account?
---
Lol I saw something similar at a camp on ps4 today.
---
Charge before entering vats, having almost 100% success this way
---
This was my third(?) direct interaction with one. Usually I just see them talking to other people and keep on moving. Most of the RPers I see/hear are "Raiders" breaking people's shit or trying to initiate PVP. Which, alright cool. Whatever floats your boat. Not my thing but I'm not gonna judge you for finding a shred of enjoyment in the world. But for fuck's sake, consent is mandatory.
---
Can other players on your team kill you? I could have swore the player who killed me was on my team.
---
West Virginian here, sadly the BBQ, moonshine, and bluegrass radio are the only good ambience unless you want a bunch of junkies shambling around...lol I mean the natural beauty is better than anything.
---
Hit. You ain't killing a single enemy with a syringer.
---
Then take your own advice. If these posts aren‚Äôt griefing you, destroying your shit then just move on right? Because I believe if it‚Äôs bothering someone that much that their team mates aren‚Äôt helping get the objective they have every right to post about it. I‚Äôve played plenty of daily ops solo. So it‚Äôs possible. But you obviously don‚Äôt think it is. So have a great day, and don‚Äôt let the post bother you.
---
I've downgraded so much of my actual build so I can decorate more lol
---
Depending on your level, it might be easier to solo the event but you need to be prepared. I think not being prepared for Encryptid is why most people don‚Äôt do it. See Angry Turtle on YT as he has great guides for soloing this event. After watching them I found I could easily solo the event (admittedly it was pre-22 nerf).
---
Essentially get a lot of food ready - namely Scorchbeast meat of various types as they give you amazing HP regen. This enables you to activate the pylons and survive.
---
But the gauss weapons do ballistic damage
---
But also not knowing what they are searching for, but hearing them get more frantic about digging for "it" through time would be great, the forever unknown mystery
---
I mean, I did. Sue me for trying to have a discussion.
---
No, they are energy ammo. There are tiny 2mm Ferromagnetic slugs in the cylindrical magazine, but the magazine also contains a battery to power the electromagnets in the weapon. So while technically the projectile is ballistic, the ammunition can't function without a battery, so it's classified as energy ammo. It is affected by the "Batteries Included" perk.
---
It's under Misc. Structures my friend. Enjoyüëçüèº
---
It was flagged for being about trading, but I contacted the mods and it was allowed through
---
How do you start the possum badge stuff? I want to get a prince.
---
I seriously get so excited when I find another female! And yes, amount of weird Xbox messages I have gotten is off the charts! Feel free to find and jump in whenever I‚Äôm on.
---
I have a terrible sense of direction in real life and it translates well to the virtual world so the Galleria is mercifully simple. I have a full set of troubleshooters armor so I enjoy tanking the robots.
---
Get some authentic frontier gibberish from Blazing Saddles... haha
---
I run a magic shotgun (vamp combat limb damage) with a bloodied build. It shreds everything. Before one wasteland 1 shot, now two headshots max for most enemies.
---
Vats can be dodgy though.
---
Why not? You‚Äôre fine with buying things from vendors or from trading with person in real time, so why not this?
---
Yup
---
I kinda wish there was a tab to hide them in our stash. I can't part with my displays though. I wish with the stash box added seperate in game that displays could also be seperate from our stash.
---
1 cap per 1 charge is the going rate for fusion cores. ie a full charged core is 100 caps.
---
I join and wait for the person that made the group to hop in before doing anything. I'm running into a lot of people that make daily ops teams, do nothing then just leave and it's like uhh okay dude. This is your group we were waiting on you.
---
I was hitting 1300 charged shot and 427 regular shot pre update....my vats critical was nearly 3k.  Now...I‚Äôm at 407 per shot, 800 charged and around 1 k vats critical.  I still use it as my main....but it‚Äôs taken quite a hit with the new update, so much so, Im using a vampire flamer on daily ops to power through
---
I know, i have a gauss mini. Batteries included reduces 2mm weight. It doesn‚Äôt make sense but yeah
---
&gt; What I've found is that when theres an empty goo pile or ash pile, it means that someone else has loot on it. 
---
This thought did occur to me. However, the problem is that I get the empty goo piles all the time when I am *alone* in my private game. There is nobody else in that entire game instance. If the goo piles have loot allocated for someone else in a private game instance when I'm the only player there, then that's clearly a bug.
---
Having said that, I'm still inclined to believe that it has to do with the corpse to meat pile -mechanism, since I have witnessed the no loot -issue happen with literally hundreds upon hundreds of older goo piles, goo piles that I've left unlooted for example in Uranium Fever as I've been killing enemies, whereas fresh goo piles seem to have loot just fine. As such, I don't think it has anything to do with the goo piles allocating loot to other players, since I'm playing all by myself, alone, in my private game.
---
They wanted to *cut* down the price.
---
I did a run with my Flachette Mod Harpoon Gun. I'm already self-sufficient with my ammo, but I got like 200 extra harpoons as a reward.
---
Yeah nice. Kinda like ammo. Easy to remember when 1 thing-to-sell is worth 1 currency-thing.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm using primed shotguns and am getting ultracite rounds from both mobs and rewards.
---
Fucking shred, mole bros.
---
you shitting me?, id pay handsomely for that kind of price if i didn't have too many of them already lol.
---
Gotta rename her Mama Anger Issues.
---
Dang I've been underpricing mine, no wonder they sell fast lol.
---
 Power Patrol uniforms FOR SURE!!
---
it's the power patrol season, so why do we get 2 subjugator uniforms as rewards?
---
Lucky fucker!  Lol
---
I wouldn't pay or sell them for more than 65 for fully charged.
---
Well, in the case of this dude asked me if I wanted to join the Brotherhood. I politely declined, he cursed at me. Told him I dont RP and asked him not to speak to me that way and he said he could do whatever he wanted. Blocked.
---
If you wanna RP, cool. But like... don't be a dick, y'know?
---
Thank Christ for that. I can only repeat the same points so many times.
---
Turn on Pacific mode. It's in the play menu after you are in the game.
---
I sell full charged ones for 90
---
The issue is more so the explosive effect in general, especially when combined with rapid fire weaponry. It causes a lot of FPS and audio performance issues since each explosive round has so many effects attached to it, and then those effects are multiplied with each successive round.
---
They should greatly reduce the lighting effects with explosive rounds and shorten the duration of their sound effects, maybe scaling with how fast / how many simultaneous projectiles fire from your gun.
---
i usually sell mine for 69 caps because i am a child
---
thank you! your girlfriend thinks so too!
---
Ballistic Bock increases damage on my gauss shotgun.
---
Lol in 2 more days I will have a diffrent vualt 94 plan for every day of the week..I have 4 right now
---
i solve this issue by having all my vendors on one wire connected to my RR garage. When I need to place more things, i just scrap the wire and turn them all off, restock, rewire, and everything is stocked and back to normal lol
---
I have had zero problems kicking free riders in the middle of daily ops.  And it usually goes like this.....
---
Camp.....
---
Kick....
---
Message: Why‚Äôd you kick me?
---
Message: Why do you think?
---
Can you charge and then do multiple shots before having to exit VATS and recharging.
---
Solid State Drive. Cuts loading. New consoles use them too.
---
Likely has to do with the tunnel the purveyor is digging
---
Should be an option.
---
Because there are players who want this and players like me who just experienced almost 2 years of having like 5 "high level" areas and like 75% of the map useless because of the low level enemies.
---
Get tank killer at max.it will make a difference I'm only using 1 perk in each commando slot and max tank killer.no problems while sneaking if not sneaking a half clip usually takes care of most
---
Missing one notable event, line in the sand
---
My advice is to stop being pissy about other people not playing the game the same way as you, and posting the fifteenth consecutive rant about the exact same thing.
---
People will play Ops the way that fits their style best. If that's not for you, move on to a new team  (or make your own) and quit bitching about it. I play Ops my way and make my own team to do it now that everybody has jumped on the bandwagon of switching to casual after the first run. (So I guess technically I *do* follow my own advice.)
---
I‚Äôd also like to see the laser RCW, such a unique gun that should‚Äôve gotten more recognition
---
What is the green men about? Supermutants? Flat woods monster? (It‚Äôs a zetan)
---
Solid State Drive.
---
In very simple terms, when you store things on your computer, you need a storage space to put them. Regular storage (Hard Disk Drive or HDD) are the baseline. But there is a fancier version called a Solid State Drive (SSD). They are more expensive, and come with some specific advantages/disadvantages over a HDD.
---
The biggest advantage of the SSD, is that your computer can pull information off of it faster. So if you've got one, you'll often be able to load into a game ahead of other people, unless the devs put in a secondary delay so everyone can sync up.
---
Does scrapping the wire actually keep them from browsing the inventory?  I have mine in a locked shed, all wired to a switch in another location.  Whenever I turn them off I can still browse the vendor inventory.
---
Facts
---
Agree. It‚Äôs so aggravating. Had this happen several times today. Even had a person join the Daily Ops team while I was doing the event and he didn‚Äôt join me.
---
i know, when i first played NV and found one i used it so much i was buying fusion cells from everyvendor i found. it may not have been the best weapon but it wasn‚Äôt the worst. Plus more lazer weapons wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone
---
And my advice is this isn‚Äôt even my post I just mentioned shit that happened to me, so how about you mind your own business and allow ppl to post their frustration and not act like you rule reddit. So how about you either get off Reddit or realize ppl have different opinions then you.
---
you have a misguided sense of loyalty my bro
---
I sell mine at 1 cap per 2 charge - max 50 caps, min charge 90% (45c)
---
I've never noted not getting goo/ash loot from enemies that I've most definitely killed (private world, as you said) so I cannot comment on that myself.  Maybe I'll pull the old Plasma out for a spin and burn my partials to do some more private testing.
---
I wonder if it's both, as I have seen my goo piles disappear after friends loot them, so I'm convinced that it's at least one cause.
---
Oh well...more testing required.
---
That's the beauty of his build videos. I don't necessarily copy them but it gets me thinking about my own build and provides ideas about how to improve it.
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about some game thing not a piece of hardware.
---
I've recently moved from commando to shotgun. It is Fun to play with, but its honestly really lackluster. Even with unobtainable weapons, Its still not that great. 
---
Its only usable today due to the Magic weapon bug. If this bug is ever fixed, then shotguns at√© done
---
Zero caged lights, 6 solar panels.  We need to tag each other to swap
---
That would be sweet. A (slightly) more accurate/faster artillery
---
did you guys buy Skyrim ? I've heard it helps solve the problem
---
Oo quad would be nice. Does it stack with the bigger canister?
---
That would be nice. I just kept having my game lag and it would result in me removing stuff from the displays on accident and I got tired of fixing it lol. Plus I wanted more budget for other things. I really like the displays but they just take such a toll on it, same with the turrets. I wanted turrets but they destroy the budget too. Its a big RIP.
---
Yeah I know what one is, I thought it was a game thing not a hardware thing.
---
Honestly, I am not sure, but I think it does. Put it in my stash for now because I was too heartbroken to scrip it
---
Ive heard the flechette mod is good. Does it use shotgun perks, or heavy?
---
Yeah, without the ability to one hit, the gauss is pretty much useless..
---
Full I sell them for 80. It‚Äôs cheaper than the standard 100 caps for a full charge.  It makes people buy them because they see it‚Äôs cheaper. And I don‚Äôt mind giving them at a discount.
---
Is ‚Äúbetter than metal armor‚Äù a ringing endorsement?
---
I want more picture slots for loading screens
---
if you apply any of the PA skins (if you own any) to any piece (or all) of the armor pieces, the power armor itself won't show up when you go to scrap things.
---
Isnt that what the free states signs are for?
---
Use pegboard and put them in the high tech cabinet.
---
Big Iron &gt; Johnny Guitar
---
I don't bother with turrets either. I'd rather just repair my base. Rip indeed
---
Preach
---
Wasn‚Äôt me chief. I just saw the question and don‚Äôt know of any other kind of ssd that affects load time.
---
Adjusting adapting and overcoming doesn't work when things aren't consistent in my opinion they should fix blocking and add the possibility to hold blocking like in skyrim that way if you don't block you get staggered and if you fo block, then you don't get staggered
---
I typically do 50% of the charge as the price. So 100% would be 50 caps
---
Exploration. I hope they add or change some stuff up soon.
---
Would like to see a radioactive and a poison cloud one to mix up the risks.  Also would like to see something that gives bloodied and stealth builds and edge sometimes.
---
I mean really we are the assholes lol they just wanna dig and find whatever it is they wanna find and here we come along fucking them up and their operation and then stealing everything they have ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
You can rename it? Omg! I'm L100+ and embarrassed. Thank you!
---
Just how about versions that use existing ammo. Don‚Äôt need more ammo that wastes space and dilutes the pool even more for low levels without access to ammo perks.
---
no, cuz it shows the vendor as empty till you repower it, ergo they can't buy shit till you turn it back on lol
---
üòÖ happy to help
---
I just like displaying things on my walla as my floor real estate is too consumed. I just wish we had more visually appealing stuff, main reason I bought the new ones is so it doesn't look so offputting conpared to my "log cabin" vibe
---
Ballistic ammo always drops from the mobs but cores and explosives wont.
---
all the more reason. the text chat could easily have translation, which voice doesn‚Äôt
---
My boyfriend just started playing and hes having a bit of a hard time building up his inventory. If you're giving away or selling them in-game for cheap I'm sure he'd love to see if theres anything he can use!
---
I don't get why All bloodied PA builds dismiss the medic pump. I tried the emergency protocol mod and I fucking hate it. So what if the medic pump gets a little overzealous and stims for every nudge I take... I practically never die and that's the whole point of it. I can't miss the right moment to heal, I can fire spin-up weapons without having to worry the Quick heal won't register... I just keep blasting and never worry. Medic pump FTW, imho
---
That was one thing I liked about before the patch low level legendary creatures dropping low level legendary weapons and armor. Nothing like making a new players day like dropping a nice 3 star for them.
---
Really!? I cant make out a damn thing they say
---
They definitely go quick. pretty good caps from it even at 5 because I just make a habit of always holding power plants
---
What level? Tell us ur build I‚Äôm 130 and I‚Äôve never done a silo period mostly because I don‚Äôt wanna get yeeted
---
I'm at MY camp the other day restocking my plans vendor when some dude starts knifing me in the back, shouting through voice chat to move so that he could use the vendor. I don't think he realized it was me at my own camp and even though he was incredibly annoying, I got a good laugh out of it.
---
Most of the stuff dies from one shot anyway. At least Works for not missing the First shot
---
Heavy perks. I got into it very recently when I started seeing these Cursed Harpoon Guns pop up in vending machines, guessing they're loot from some event. Noticed that they have the bash damage legendary effect which turns fast firing weapons into  magic weapons in VATS (they deal high damage without any discernible reason), and you can actually trigger this effect with the flachette mod, since you're hitting the enemy 4 times in rapid succession.
---
And people say it‚Äôs sad and feels bad to kill the treasure hunters running away? Nah fam, kill them ALL
---
Based on my experience the Daily Ops teams are working mostly as intended. I always join one before I run the op and it seems like most people have gotten the memo and the process runs reasonably smooth. I'm all for a public silo team.
---
That validates it for me much more than ‚Äúit‚Äôs from the wiki‚Äù. Thanks. I wish they didn‚Äôt distort it so much though. Like turn it down 3 notches maybe you hear two words semi clearly instead of .05
---
I think mole miners are some of the most intriguing enemies in 76. They have camps around closed doors in the savage divide, they aren‚Äôt like any other mutant we‚Äôve seen, and there‚Äôs a tunnel in the basement of the Rusty Pick that leads SOMEWHERE. I wish Bethesda would reveal more about them.
---
Yah I don‚Äôt think this person knew who they were hitting either.  I just blocked them and dropped server
---
Are you in fullscreen mode or bordleress windowed?
---
You sound like a selfish douche. Why are you even playing an mmo?
---
Level 60 gauss rifle men and your befine if your that level all u need is power armor or high stealth(like me) and a crap ton of ammo just make sure to kill all enemy's before going the objectives (which I didnt do so took my 3vhours cause I kept dying) I'd be happy to help if your on ps4
---
That's the best , relieving the stresses of the day.  It's a nightly was to chill out after the long day.  I'm sorry it isn't doing the same as it did in the beginning.  I've adjusting to the new one waste land ,the best I could.
---
I played forl4 on ultra settings. The same PC crashes frequently in the fo76 when settings above average. Still decent.
---
I had bought half the levels and been playing a ton during Meat Week so earned a lot of levels through score alone; I was level 95 on SCORE when that bug popped up and I had to watch ALL 95 LEVELS PROC ON SCREEN ALL OVER AGAIN. 
---
So. Damn. Annoying. And in the center of the screen no less!
---
I just drop them when I have more than 15 in my inventory  üòÖ i have around 25-50 armor and weapons for sale on my two character üòÖ but if I put them for sale they go for 65. Above that they stay for to long
---
Yeah it's primed for me. I dont have to craft ammo for it. A run or two of daily ops has you in a good net positive.
---
80c!? Holy cow
---
They‚Äôre from A Colossal Problem. A new event to nuke Monongah mine and spawn a wendigo collosus inside
---
My husband and I are going through the same thing. We use non-meta builds, and end less than a minute away from Paladin completion each time. But every person we join or people that join us literally do nothing and don‚Äôt even load into the Op.
---
If anyone has the same frustration on PSN, hit us up. Just a warm body that literally just stands there would be enough to reach top rank every time.
---
This team system needs revised.
---
Honestly fair. I‚Äôve prolly killed hundreds of thousands of their comrades with explosive rounds so I‚Äôd be pretty angry tooü§£
---
Max out nerd rage and aim for headshots
---
Yeah fair enough. I use it in vats. There is no reason not too. Even if you don't have any cards for vats. It doesnt use that much ap per shot.
---
Just be well tuned or whatever do your ap regens quicker.
---
Jesus christ the combat lines feel like whats happening in Homelander's mind all the time. And thats not a reassuring thing.
---
Lol didn‚Äôt think of that. I was thinking just for the person who owns the camp.
---
Well, we technically get the red viper fatigues and paints for all non pa armors. Then we get the subjugator mask and outfit separately
---
I knew they spoke in muffled English when I heard them say what sounded like "Take THIS" when they lunge at ya, but holy shit this is dark.
---
Even Microsoft bought it
---
What if they‚Äôre digging for the interloper, and the cultists just managed to beat them to it?
---
I've not got into charging these yet, will have to try harder.
---
true, maybe a skin for the 10mm that make it into the 9mm from NV, or maybe the .45 auto from honest hearts since that wouldn‚Äôt need new ammo
---
There‚Äôs another one of hose inside of Tanagra Town and more in the Interloper‚Äôs chamber :)
---
They would just sell it, and everyone would bitch about selling last games dlc again, so they don‚Äôt.
---
Loading times are purely based on hardware for NW. someone with a faster PC can be loaded in and ready while you‚Äôre still loading.
---
If you're a team leader and you dont plan to do ops more, change the team to casual
---
I have basically the same set up except the monitor. 
---
I play on 1080p and the game unfortunately just runs like ass.  Game randomly drops below 60fps constantly but I play with everything except shadows and grass on highest settings. I set grass and shadows to the lowest it can go and fov low as well. 
---
If youre trying to play it on your native monitor resolution your cpu is gonna be a big bottleneck specifically for this game and I imagine most games. Not by a lot mind you but its still a bottleneck. 
---
Most importantly make sure your game is running in * Full screen mode* not windowed not borderless but full screen. 
---
After that tweak the settings. I've never been able to hit consistent 100+ frames even with everything low and im on 1080p with a ryzen 3600 and 2070s as well.
---
I just did my first solo at lvl 108 a couple weeks ago. If you go by the book it can be a tremendous pain in the ass as is a very long process.using glitch hacks ,you can bypass a couple of the optional objectives and walk through the whole process in about 20 minutes.let me know if you need an escort.
---
Well yeah, but it‚Äôd also require a lot more energy to move something that size *faster than sound*
---
But it would be very very cool
---
I felt bad yesterday when my internet went down and I was the leader, presumably kicking the other 3 halfway through
---
I think even pre patch 22 you shouldn‚Äôt engage a yao guai at level 16.
---
They don‚Äôt go into the void, if you kill them while they‚Äôre tunneling down their corpse spawns at the point where they would‚Äôve dig up. You just have to look around a little bit
---
Thank ATOM they are violent because now I don't mind COMMITING MOLE MINOR GENOCIDE and won't feel so bad killing their treasure hunters in a few weeks. Lmao
---
hrhr, that's the reason why the welcome-mats only work at workshops. It would be to easy to place them on a spike-trap and everyone who travels to the camps would fall victim .)
---
The self-Recharching Energy gun from NV would be awesome to have, especially for lower levels where the ammo is scarce.
---
Other candidates would be the Pulse weapons from Fallout 2 or the Solar Scorcher form the Guardian of Forever random encounter.
---
And speaking of Guardian of Forever, I'd love a "similar" event at Pylon V-13... I hope they consider adding some variations on the theme after they deliver Expeditions in 2021.
---
Congrats!

They are completely free üòä

Not so terrifying though when they die so easily. They have zero reason to be so cocky against us blue suits ha. Since we consistently annihilate them.

Maybe........have not seen hard evidence but have seen people post about it.

 They‚Äôve used a bunch idk what you‚Äôre on about. Chinese stealth suit, hellfire PA, nuka cherry armor skins, combat rifle pumpkin skin to name just a few.
---
I feel you bro!  My buddy is lvl 25 he burns through every bit of ammo on hand, breaks every gun and every piece of armor in about an hour. Even with a lvl 150‚Äôs help and support he is getting frustrated with the game and is calling it a grind.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt entering another player‚Äôs instanced interior CAMP still hold that risk of walking into a trap? Or is there a no build zone by the door?
---
Thank you probs doesn't seem much too u high levels lol ( not being rude)
---
There is [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=1495641013) from the same creator of the Season 1 version.
---
Rockopolis expansion when.
---
Bethesda designed it like that intentionally because they initially believed players would play this game like it was Rust or something, and they intended for scams to happen. 
---
Or, they‚Äôre just incompetent, pick whatever answer works for you.
---
He said he'll be playing for the next couple hours at least so he should be able to catch you! (he's AirbornHydra)
---
Oh j did mine legit with no glitches took me 3 hours cause j died 100+ times
---
they're as common as a common thing
---
How can you put weapon-specific cards in your build if you never know what you're going to find?
---
I‚Äôve killed some players in workshops that spoke like hillbillies. Is that what you mean?
---
The gold bullion one is literally called ‚ÄúThe Gauntlet‚Äù
---
Perfect! Thank you.
---
Vault 63
---
Rad sponge
---
No, it's a big deal.   I didn't do mine until level 328 or so.   I wanted to get it in before One Wasteland hit, with its damage nerf and enemy buff.
---
They are going to have to back and create more of a variance on enemies.  Like the current set up the minimum enemy level is equal to your level.  But they can be higher (so far I've seen as high as 10 on regular enemies, the scorch queen was 30 higher than me).  It should be like a 20 level range.  Then the game would feel more fair.
---
The Creepy Mothman because the Mothman Cultist icon is never in the shop.

i love to bring Chally‚Äôs Feed to Chally üêÆ üêÆ
---
Oh sorry, my bad.

X4. I'll keep my eyes open üëç
---
How are random people supposed to know if you ignored the event prompt vs just didn‚Äôt want to join. 8 people is the max and yes I know about joining teammates after it‚Äôs started but once you get 8 it just puts you outside.
---
In the wayward after you've done the questline there.
---
Feels like daily ops ammo looting has gotten slower. I think they might have stealthed nerfed it. It feels like significantly fewer enemies are spawning. Especially if you go in solo.
---
Hey bud!! Yes I agree, such a helpful group in PKOA :)
---
It took you 11 days to come up with that?
---
Ive probably helped more strangers than you have in this game.  Being a selfish douche is trying to tell people how to play an MMO like the people in this thread
---
That sound bug affects other weapons too not just the plasmas.
---
I usually buy all cores in the vendor if the price is between 50-60
---
As you should
---
If they're not joining an active ops, then I'll just continue to kick them. There is no reason not to, joining the team but not the ops just wastes everyone's time.
---
That's... Odd. No perk required, just click on an item in your inventory and then click ok. 
---
There are a few items that show a value of 0 caps, you can't sell them, even tho everything else you can't sell doesnt even show up in your inventory list, there are a few that still appear.
---
I don't know what the official lore is specifically, but I believe the mole miners are mutant descendants of those who took shelter in the mines when the bombs fell. I would suspect this line relates to the vaults. What it makes me think is that the original survivors figured they could use their tools and dig into the nearby vault to take shelter. As they deteriorated, this became an obsession with the original goal becoming something cloudy and them only remembering that they have to keep digging to find what they're looking for, even if what "it" is has been lost to them.
---
I thought the workaround was to take a screenshot showing you have it and send to support to get the atoms.  Silly me.
---
Thay can drop from christmas gifts, so they exist en masse from the duped/traded and distributed gifts.
---
They are, as a result, pretty common.
---
The T-65 has a good bright head lamp well mine is fine, in fact too bright when up close to stuff?
---
50 for fusion 40 for plasma
---
yeah i agree!! i love when he sings the meat week song :D
---
If drums and spits are full from the start the event auto completes without any additional effort.
---
Just today two level 5 folks came by my camp and I set them up with Brotherhood rifles and upgraded knight suits
---
you reached lvl 9000
---
Welcome to the community :)
---
Fair enough, got no counterpoint.
---
I think you should do you. However, in my case my annual subscription renews in November. It basically comes out to $9 a month. I'm pretty sure I haven't spent 2600+ hours watching Netflix and HBO to compare a couple of typical subscription services (which I also subscribe to). Now with Wastelanders, ACP, Seasons, Daily Ops, Legendary perks, I'm currently having even more fun than I had when I signed on. I see no reason that this trend will not continue for the next year. Based on the enjoyment I get from the game (bugs and all) and the perks of the membership which enhances that enjoyment, I'll fork out the 9 bucks.
---
Lol,same here . I had a veteran come help me out but the second run which was solo was a lot easier once I actually knew what I was doing. The only bad thing was the difference between lvl one eyebots and lvl 50 eyebots the 2nd time along with level 75 colonel gutsys and assaultrons.
---
Yeesh. It's a game not a career. No need to be so brass tacks about it. 
---
Can't reasonably expect everyone to play the game exactly how you want them to play it.
---
Ei! I play on pc to, asked here time ago and nobody answered but a guy came in game two days later, and since that day we usually okay every day, we now are a 4 squad, but there are other not hard players that also join to us. 
---
Same name as here, but not in not online.
---
I've been asking for cosmetic stars next to our names for the whole time the Legendary Perks have been on the PTS, but they never acknowleged the suggestions :(
---
I bet they want to keep the stars for when they introduce some sort of New Game Plus system.
---
That's the one. I couldn't think of it off the top of my head.
---
Fasnacht&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
true. and pluse weapons would be very nice against robots for the lower levels who can‚Äôt kill everything in 5 seconds like alot of endgame players can
---
and event completion splashes. I'd like to see what I'm looting/looking at
---
Yeah he was saying every enemy was about 10 lvls higher then him. I had to rescue him from 10 lvl 30 scorched who were chasing him through Charleston when he was lvl 21.
---
actually it took me 11 days to give a shit about reddit
---
Fallout 4's Dunwich Borers comes to mind.
---
Pretty sure only the Gauss Shotgun is considered ballistic.
---
A better solution would be simply if you hit a legendary enemy and it does you automatically get the legendary drop in you inventory.
---
I agree that adjustments and fixes should be made.Sadly this can be said about many things in this game.
---
My problem was mainly with just asking for a stagger immunity because one thing made the game slightly more troublesome.A few simple solutions would be teaming up with someone who is built for melee.A PA user or someone wearing a pneumatic chest piece can run around finishing of the mobs.I mean it‚Äôs not like you have to change your build completely around or anything.Switch out your chest piece for a pneumatic one or suit up in PA for the op if you want to solo it otherwise get help from other players.
---
Haha.
---
Hahahaha.
---
No.
---
And I was the first thing you thought of. I'm flattered, but not interested. Sorry.
---
Yes indeed! I just don't know how I never noticed it before.
---
I love Grahm.
---
there is literally a reflex sight for that thing that bethesda chose not to implement lmao
---
Actually I‚Äôm using it to funnel ultracite plasma ammo to 2 other toons. I have a commando using a prime bloody plasma rifle and a gunslinger using a junkies prime plasma pistol.
---
There is no pacifist mode in Nuclear Winter.
---
I'm so glad I never heard one say that. lol
---
oh no, you got it confused. im fucking your girlfriend. im not interested in you.
---
Oh boy, another reason to shit myself when I'm ganged up on by a group of coal miners with missile launchers
---
Someone else was wondering about that.
---
you can have backpacks but you lose calibrated shocks. fair?
---
I recommend you check one of the subs that allows bartering. This one does not.
---
power armor is a backpack
---
Same here. The 20% chance vats explosion seems to do the same AOE damage of a single hit of the weapon I'm using. FYI if you haven't already equipped it, incisor 3 made a huge difference for me to tweak damage back up after the nerf
---
Ppl can build you one at your camp long at you two are in a non-public team
---
What kind of PA do you use?
---
Excavator you get a bonus 100 carry weight for a full set. Also I believe every PA has a calibrated shock that allows extra weight, you just have to buy the plans form vendors at white springs
---
If it‚Äôs at a sliver of health ;). 
---
.  Just finished the tadpole badge for hunting - kill a yau guai with a syringer
---
I can build one for you
---
Same, I got 2 x 1 star weapons from a 1 star ghoul yesterday?
---
i got you!
---
was just about to go off but let's do this
---
*screams of death and blood*
---
*plays smooth classical music at Rusty Pick*
---
They should do something, if not backpacks then just up the carry weight somehow. It seems kind of counterintuitive that a person in regular armor can carry 100 lbs. more than someone in power armor.
---
I think its better than ‚Äúill claw your teeth out‚Äù since youll be dead by the time that happens
---
I could listen to Bach all day.
---
Whoever took the time to figure out what the gang of mole people beating them to death were saying through their resporators deserves a medal
---
Where are you on the map?
---
How?! ive inspected it in my inventory but you can't rename the frame in the workstation.
---
I had a junkies explosive harpoon and before the new nerf I was hitting 1600 base damage with the flechette mod. I traded it before the nerf but it was legacy so I probably should have kept it.
---
Best theory I‚Äôve seen tbh, and makes a lot of sense
---
Wow. If there was a mod to make them sound clearer but with the same guttural voice..
---
I do recall in one of their past statements regarding what they had planned for this year (before the updated roadmap mind you) they mentioned how it would be taking us outside of Appalachia as you said, but then went onto mention revisiting some of the fans' favorite locations from past titles.
---
Maybe try standing in toxic water until you catch something? Good luck mate.
---
I always thought of tracksuited gopniks as being rather post-Soviet
---
yeah same speed we don't need our internal organs anyway :P
---
I appreciate the advice.  I really do and I am trying to do that.  I can solo them but it takes a while.
---
Just sucks joining public teams hoping to get better only to get dumped.  
---
It‚Äôs also not like I am level 50 or below or have shit weapons.  One wasteland hit my build hard and trying to get back to having a decent build which has been tough going from a decent rifleman build to a heavy guns build with some balance in between.
---
It would be cool to join a public team and be able to learn a bit.  I get it‚Äôs timed but again, don‚Äôt just bump team members on public teams, that‚Äôs just shitty.
---
If I saw one of those rushing me when it says, "*I'll peel off your skin!"* lol
---
I have salty tenderizer mod plans anyone wanna buy?
---
I feel much less crazy for always thinking I could hear actual words when fighting them
---
Ive been farming fort defiance and watoga.  All the enemies are lvl 20.  All tge weapons are 50
---
Pretty ironic considering how easily I destroy them
---
Not sure about "rockopolis", but there is an area in the code mentioned as being a Mole Miner Tunnel System and no, it isn't the same tunnel from the Settlers' Vault 79 raid either. It has three entrances across the map, either boarded up or blocked with rubble currently.
---
She passive aggressively gives us garbage on purpose. lol
---
Appreciate the offer, thanks. I‚Äôd just really like to get the plan so I can build one for my friends who have been trying to get also.
---
Getting ready for black Friday?
---
Well she did always have a thing for smart, mature men. I can certainly see why she's interested in you.
---
I want more events like these on a cycle every couple weeks or so. It'll keep the player count up and let me ,and many others, enjoy the game.
---
Just like the Star Wars Death troopers, they also all have actual dialogue.
---
Add me on PS4 I‚Äôll hook you up with a stash of supplies and some dope plans
---
PSN: Heshgawd
---
Same. Usually I'd had a few by the time I'd hear things like, "AHHH! I'll F$#%ING KILL YOU!"
---
Cool. Then everyone else can too.
---
They aren't really descendants so much, given it's only been 25 years. In fact, pretty much all of the mole miners we see are the original miners.
---
I agree with everything you said 100%. In MMOs there is always a divide between the PvE and PvP communites. Old school RuneScape is similar to this game, where any talk of PvP is heavily downvoted and looked down upon, even though PvP is 100% optional, just like 76.
---
Survival mode was a beautiful thing when it was around. However, alot of non PvP players were drawn to it due to unique rewards, got completely annihilated, cried non stop on the forums about players wrecking them in PvP. 
---
This ultimately resulted in the devs putting in damage caps and other balance tweaks that the PvP community never wanted, and quite frankly the game didn't need. The damage cap made all builds non viable except for full auto. People used to be able to snipe with rifles, gut you in melee, and one use other weapons aside from full auto rifles.
---
Most of the PvP community has left now, and I don't play much these days either. There hasn't been any reason for us to stay, people will say "play nuclear winter" but it's not at all the same as adventure mode/survival mode PvP. People want to fight with their maxed out characters wearing the gear they spent literally hundreds of hours to acquire. Fuck us right?
---
Anyway great on you for having interest in PvP. I hope everything works out for you my man.
---
Those have been in the game for a while now and have never been explained.
---
It is people being dicks and that is the issue, look at the sub....people upset about slow player who I bet are more like me, just trying to figure it out.
---
For a community that talks about how cool stuff is, this is the exact opposite.  No one is launching nukes and doing daily ops so it limits other players then to get shut out....that is an issue.
---
Rockopolis is a thing from F3.
---
It was referenced in the radio plays, and you could find a (rather disappointing) location labeled as Rockopolis. 76 and 3 are geographically close enough that they *could* probably make it work i think.
---
Before Electric Absorption - 100 caps
---
Now - 50 caps
---
I was on last night and got a random psn message and someone asked me to answer a riddle, I answered correctly and he gave me 500 holiday gifts which resulted in me maxing out my caps and getting over 200 stims.
---
I love the community forreal
---
It *is* hard. Tantamount impossible to get max rank because you can‚Äôt be in several places at once. Pre nerf, I could barely solo two creatures. Now I can‚Äôt do one by myself.
---
Thank God, don't need anyone seeing the screenshots from "Wastelanders Gone Wild" being shown to everyone.
---
Itty bitty molerat power armor too, please.
---
Green men?
---
Wow. Their combat lines puts the incredibly sadistic and bloodthirsty Blood Eagles to shame.
---
Yay! I'm joining you now :D
---
I'm queued to join your world, hope you don't mind the delay
---
A lot of games and other programs have functions that are in the code but not normally implemented for use. It could be test code for future functions, or even an abandoned feature that was never fully developed.
---
I‚Äôm game! What‚Äôs your gt?
---
Nope.
---
They can not
---
I‚Äôm not really doing primal cuts anymore.  My guns break really fast and I‚Äôm running out of adhesive.  I also noticed that I‚Äôm unable to turn in my primal cuts.
---
I never understood what the thinking was behind putting them inside the Crater rather than in the main camp.
---
That is terrifying lol
---
Great work! 
---
So were they once people? 
---
Such interesting dialogue, so intense
---
just invite me
---
You don't know which weapon you'll get. But when you're on a team the likely hood one of the 4 players get a weapon for one of the four builds increases. I always know who on my team is a certain build and we swap weapons.
---
There actually seems to be a "mole miner city" cell that hasn't been unlocked yet or is cut content. It popped up on YouTube a year ago. But I'd love to see that at some point populated with Mole Miners.
---
I held onto one for the longest time and called it the big stomper
---
Fine. I mean non-power users cannot have both backpacks and also 5 unyielding armor pieces with deep pocketed... oh wait.
---
Jokes aside I would be fine with that.
---
It's annoying that I have to slap on level 3 traveling pharmacy just to hop into power armor but then I lose either 3 things off of strength.
---
I think what you meant to ask for is a Sentry model power armor that lets you roll and plow through your enemies like a tank and also gives +200 Carry weight :)))
---
K
---
I think they are talking about Glowing Ones or Supermutants
---
It does. If they were a little more legible it would be terrifying.
---
They will catch up to the rest of you eventually, calm down.
---
this shit about legendary or magic weapons should be fixed. it degrading the game but people dont want to hear about fix because  majority use them.
---
Just install this mod and you'll find them easy. I use the pink/purpleish one. These mods will not get you banned either as they're cosmetic only.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144
---
I also very highly recommend the perk manager mod. Makes switching between 12 different perk sets extremely easy.
---
LOL at typo 'punch owl' indeed.  
---
TBH, besides swarms, which you'd get anywhere, One Wasteland kinda killed the 'danger' of drinking Nukashine from punch bowls/Nuka-Cola vending machines.
---
Fingers crossed. It's a long shot but it'd be a neat and plausible tie in.
---
It should collapse. Selling 2 star nocturnal super sledges for 6k needs to stop
---
Thanks...but all I did was Google. I don't know how in almost 2 years I didn't notice this. They were people once yeah. Prewar they were coal miners who took to cave systems. It's a little bit I think like.
---
&gt;cant even use mine with dropping half my weapons and armor
---
Dont carry 30 weapons then?
---
No evidence whatsoever. My vendor is up and I see most player vendors still up too. Very active and have seen no improper vending on my side
---
Gauss minigun and shotgun they are probably the best ones
---
Man, I live right in the heart of appalachia, I couldn't agree more
---
Most likely it's because they kept a lot from fallout 4 whilst making fallout 76 so they've got a lot of things that we can't even use.
---
You say a lot of well thought out and insightful ideas but the problem is bethesda just hears...
---
‚Äú let‚Äôs add this to the list of atom shop purchases and if it doesn‚Äôt sell, let‚Äôs make the game situation with it worse until it does‚Äù
---
Thankfully, someone at Microshaft will see the disparity soon and remove Bethesda from the equation, then address your actual concerns ( which I share).
---
On that day, I can go back to playing my favorite franchise. Thank god.
---
You already have two big mods you can put in your legs
---
Thanks, will take this into account if I still find that I'm dying a lot with emergency protocol.
---
No. But there was one about 2 months ago
---
I was thinking I was the only one that was thinking the same, you can't kill anything if shots fail at 3 meters of the targets 8 times in a row.
---
So they hate vault dwellers and have had run ins with super mutants
---
It‚Äôs not collapsing. High end trades still trade for 2-6 characters worth of caps. Always will. Just because some people sell in their machines for too little doesn‚Äôt mean the whole market collapsed. I still sell all my legendaries in my machine for 3-10k and higher end items on a trade only basis for caps or items.
---
atom shop. might have gone. they were there a couple of days ago.
---
Thanks all, guess that was a resounding I'm losing my marbles ü§£ü§£
---
Graham can have them for 10k
---
Kinda shitty if you ask me. Backpack + 5 Deep pocketed mods gives you 110 weight capacity. 5 Unyielding gives additional 75. I won't ever start with chemist/food mod.
---
That sounds good.  Thx
---
It's the best dr pa in the game so, why not? Ultracite is also a good alternative  because it is literally given to you from the main quest, but if you can't find the mod plans or get someone to mod your pa then it might take a while to get the mods.
---
I'm down.
---
Exactly. And if there‚Äôs a large group there‚Äôs no point having one more person chasing around doing very little . Way more valuable to be on the drums or spits. That guy was such a dumbass.
---
I sell most things for 69 because üé∂rocket 69, rocket...69!üé∂
---
Ok thanks for letting me know!
---
Once you've done the event a few dozen times and gotten each rewards over and over it tends to lose its appeal. Even the thought of a guaranteed legendary doesn't help much when youre weighed down by them already and can't scrip unwanted ones.
---
Ok, I haven't gotten the SS armor yet because I've been mainly focusing on getting the rest of the PA mods and just bought the plasma caster and gauss minigun plans. Once I finish the reset of the t-65 set I should probably work on getting SS armor.
---
I'd like to know where these things are located because I have both and cannot find them in build mode.
---
It‚Äôs like when Neo finally became one with the matrix.
---
Not the big letters, but the other ones. The skinnier looking letters
---
You hope...
---
The feeling that I'm playing me vs. the Wasteland as opposed to a main character like in normal Fallout games.
---
Possibly sounds like they might not have adjusted the world spawn weapons with the new update.  
---
Enemies should drop level appropriate stuff but it sounds like world items are not spawning correctly for your level.
---
u/ladydevann maybe
---
Or just ask your dad to politely ask them not to play fallout 76.
---
It is a game, however if more people followed decent etiquette then people who only get a short time each week to play wouldn't have to waste their time with a team that has finished doing Daily ops.
---
No worries, I totally understand those late evening vibes. But what do you think? Would what I said work better, or do you think there's another solution?
---
That's the appeal to battle royale games but one big advantage is knowing the spawn locations for large crates. They give out purple gear which is the best. They also have smaller loot pools so the chances you'll get something you can use goes up more than a medium or small crate.
---
A cosmetic mask similiar to the ghoul mask from 3 would be enough for me, and with the option to wear apparel on top of it.
---
Can't be from F04 if it says to 'Kill Earle'
---
Let us buy scrips with bullions, and also raise daily scrip limit, least by 50. 
---
Also please let us buy legendary perk coins with bullions too, since they are very comparable if traded 100:1. A high level player can level up once a day, which is two coins. If we can use our daily quota of 200 bullions to buy two coins, that‚Äôs similar amount of work spent. 
---
But no crafted legendaries should be traded, ever. Dupers stockpiled shitload of legendary modules and this essentially let them continue their business when duping isn‚Äôt easily available.
---
I‚Äôd be happy as a decoration.
---
Alright, thanks for the help.
---
Soon being a year from now. Sale has been agreed upon. It has not been approved by shareholders yet and won‚Äôt be finalized till Q3 of 2021 if everything goes smoothly.
---
A Daily Ops in that era with hordes of OP miners would be INSANE. lol
---
Sounds delightful. 
---
We shall slaughter them by the thousands!!
---
Given the numerous references through the Fallout series to Lovecraft works and how often such things are in the depths of the earth, it's possible they're looking for [The Interloper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Interloper) or something similar that is calling to them like it did to the cultists.
---
That's what I was thinking, too.
---
*ba dum tiss*
---
nice... kinda jelly.. 
---
im trying for ages now to find one.. just for that possum badge...
---
I would try making your own public team and let people join you. That way you won't get kicked. That's usually what i do since whenever i join a premade team they never join the op
---
That was the original idea but figured it be kinda rude to set limitations... from the south so hospitality is in our blood
---
There‚Äôs been a couple of times I almost had to jump onto the mic to try and direct people in the daily ops. Thank god for the follow me emote.
---
Yes.
---
You only have to look at YouTube to see daily updates on what glitches, exploits and dupes are still working. Devs will always be playing catchup but it doesn't help with the wishy washy approach to banning.
---
I sorry but what the fuck did I just learn today?
---
Honestly? Yeah. It‚Äôs be a start, or at least a bandaid fix.
---
Yes!! This is necessary!!!!
---
Ok will do
---
Will try that thanks
---
Well most nuke-runners can launch a nuke within 5 minutes or less which isn‚Äôt much timed wasted to blast someone‚Äôs shit into oblivion.
---
Ghoul's night out?
---
I think they're stale b/c the good drops rate is too low.    
---
I have two characters and mistakenly read the Plan: The Gutter last night.    
---
My Shotgunner is just that and with no 1hd Melee perks. I should have looked into what it was as I would have sold it if I could.    
---
It requires 2 Legendary mods per craft. I can't use it for many reasons especially when STR is at 15 and mostly full of Shotgun perks.    
---
If anything, I'd want the plans for most of the other items (no weapons) and conveniently a shotgun is missing from the list.  I also ogo the plan for "Whistle In the Dark" (Machine gun) on the same character.    
---
I haven't done them as much as most people but the only other thing I got and not sure if it's on that one or my main but (run on sentence) Vault 94 Jumpsuit and the Super Reactor.    
---
Is the Spec Ops suit upgradeable like the Vault suits and others? If so I'd like to get one for each char.    
---
Simply giving existing enemies a mutation and higher level isn't that 'innovative'.
---
Buying used accounts is a great way to get a surprise ban and find out you got scammed.
---
This is a fantastic picture, just, wow.
---
Want to do it one more time or are you gonna go?
---
Did the treasure hunter ones have any unique dialogue?
---
If you have concentrated fire perk you can pretty much kill them in just a few shots
---
vie carry us
---
Sorry, did not see this before!
---
It could work if pvp for camps was just disabled entirely. That would eliminate griefers. At the very least make pacifist include camp traps
---
There‚Äôs more than camp building?
---
Fra-gee-lay... It must be Italian!
---
Someone tested it on here and found SDDs load you in faster. This is still a single player engine with net code in it so even in Adventure mode everything loads way faster like a single player game. The servers are for only enemies, loot and such. Everything else is local, hence data mines.
---
...someone suggested that they attack us uranium fever because we're drilling into their city and killing their families and all they want to do is stop the machines.
---
...I wish I didn't think about that. lol
---
on your main? Aye. Go for it
---
Ok cool brb
---
worth it.. if you dont wanna play with it maybe keep it as a second weapon. very good for close range and work best in vats
---
Good god
---
Play those little vault boy info skits we can find on YouTube
---
Y‚Äôall really ran out of things to ask for, didn‚Äôt you?
---
I hope they will put Snow Globes in this year gifts, like the ones from New Vegas, along with a matching Snow Globe stand.
---
There are a lot of beautiful landmarks in Appalachia, a Snow Globe collection depicting them would be awesome!
---
Mothman and actual moths approach me the same way. Usually from the side of my peripheral vision, flying on screen near my face and freaking me out. They also drop same loot.
---
Well constructed and thought out post!! Upvoted!!
---
Here's my take: the core gameplay mechanic revolves around legendary scrip, even more so with Wastelanders and the bullion plans. 
---
Bethesda needs to up the scrip limit to 500 daily. That helps alleviate multiple issues.
---
RNG on item rolls, crafting bullion plans, vault steel, overweight stash, legendary items selling in vendors, end game play loop, etc.
---
This would boost player vending exponentially by making any well priced legendary items worth at least scrip value.  The guy who has all day to grind for stuff can sell all kinds of scrip stuff to the people who just play casually.
---
My endgame loop consists of legendary farming, turning in scrip for godrolls,  and player vending. 
---
I would play so much more if I could keep gambling with the purveyor when I have long play sessions.
---
I just want the Free States signs.
---
I‚Äôm debating going after strangler heart or T-65 that‚Äôs why I asked.
---
Not an account, a %99 percent discount coupon on FO1st to be precise. I remember they were given in giveaways.
---
Legendary Auction House!
---
Sadly is because they start with brackets and the list is in alphabetical order with numbers and symbols at the start
---
i usually play with the in general subtitles on and i thought i was crazy when i saw you're dead when fighting a mole miner i thought maybe the game had glitched
---
There is already a leg lamp in the Purveyor‚Äôs shop. Far left behind her I think.
---
Loot weapons and vendor them unscrapped.
---
my favorite is the burning mine because ik it super well and can blow through it and the exploding mutations are fun lol
---
The first time everything was such a new experience.    
---
IMO, your hunger and thirst should NOT degrade at all and needing a perk to slow it down some is a waste of points.    
---
I really like the base building in Fallout 4. 76's can be quite fun given how limited it is. IMO, both sides of walls should exist. In fact, you would swap skins making the outside metal and inside wood or switch the two.    
---
I've played long enough that I'm familiar with almost every Daily quest and know a good amount of roughly 75% of locations. I still haven't launched a nuke or completed Early's quest for either character.    
---
I'm hoping the BoS thing adds a lot for everyone.
---
They ran away from us...unarmed. I don't know if I want to know what they said. lol It would probably break me.
---
He‚Äôs there pretty often actually, I‚Äôve had it where he doesn‚Äôt even attack you at times. Moth Home near Harpers Ferry.
---
I'm amazed at how much shit people carry around, I got 2 weapons a TSE primed 50 cal. and a Furious FFR FR mini gauss, 30k rounds for each gun 5 fusion cores for PA, 20 Rad-x and 50 Rad aways plus 30 S-stims and some buff meds and soup, and I still have 100+ carry weight for junk/shite?
---
gonna go scare some smoothskins for a quick laugh, you in?
---
Dailies give a little and it adds up, easy for playing the game :) Camden Park is a start.
---
I‚Äôve never hear any of this before. Are there specific ones that say it or what? All I ever hear is their grunting and growling
---
How did you hear them/figure out what they said??
---
Sell anything and everything to vendors. Stop scrapping weapons for mods you'll never use and get caps instead.
---
It's in the wiki and game files. :)
---
They will drop again
---
Screenshots here would have been entertaining.
---
It did it once and someone on here posted a working solution.    
---
Before you log into the game or choose a character, look at the Scoreboard briefly. Back out, pick your character, and it shouldn't happen. I did that and it hasn't happened again.
---
And even if it is a big camp if you put the construction perk its still not expensive to repair.
---
Let's get a moooooove on... Oh wait.
---
They rotate through dialogue. It's so mumble/distorted though you can only make it out periodically or via the game files. If you check the wiki some of the lines they say are listed there.
---
Im on Xbox and Im willing to spent a LOT of caps to buy it off of someone
---
Oh right, the grunting *is* these lines? I‚Äôll have to keep an ear out
---
After my years of playing, this is the only legacy I own. Missed out on all the explosive energy weapon variants.
---
That or the vault in the ash heap
---
Its supposed to be for lvl 50+ but you do you. Enemies scale so i guess it doesn't matter.
---
In code it would've been "kill target$" so whatever you were pointing at that is a killable target.
---
The love cave ;)
---
Did u do anything or just sit there and expected everyone else to do something?
---
IMO this is something that should be implemented in a game from the pre-production phase, for 76 it's just too late to ever do it correctly any time soon. It would be too big of a change for how things are currently set up.
---
The best and probably only way I see this happening is if they plan Fallout 5 with a race system a la Elder Scrolls with Ghouls, Super Mutants, and other freaks, and then backport that framework, at least conceptually, to 76. Having their work already cut out for them would make things much, much easier.
---
The same goes for a lot of other things. Too big or too late for 76, but all stuff that will or might be done for Fallout 5, there's little reason for them not choose to update two games doing the heavy lifting just once.
---
I'm level 34 in season 2 already without doing any daily ops or NW events, it will  be a cake walk this season.
---
That's what I thought too.
---
You misspelled ridiculous
---
One Wasteland has killed this game for me. Everything is a bullet sponge and wrecks you. Even ants and radroaches.
---
They‚Äôre taking too long to upload to XBL.... and I‚Äôm bad at Reddit.
---
That's right yeah! Some of it is more legible than others.
---
I don‚Äôt know what level you are. But I usually go to west tek. Kill all the super mutants in there. Loot all their weapons. Server hop. And do it again about 3 times. 
---
Then I waddle all the way to the closest train station.  Equip my hard bargain level 3. And I sell 1,400caps worth of weapons to the robot. 
---
Each day 1,400 caps. Plus whatever quests and events you decide to do. Easily get 2,000+ caps per day.
---
I use a quad automatic tesla with +50% limb dmg and perks for auto rifles and daily ops are a breeze. There's a cool bug with quad teslas where sometimes it loads hundreds of rounds of ammo so you can walk around just zapping everything non-stop. It does burn a lot of ammo that way though.
---
Awesome!!
---
Do they ban everyone in the server or just the dupers
---
I gotta admit though, they sure are fun to shoot at.
---
Correction: Don't spread out over the grills and drums. Fill out one of them first (usually the drums) before having people operate the others - having three people do the same thing gives 33% bonus progress, i.e. as if you had four people on them. Operate the instruments (and spits) as soon as you fast travel to the event. They give progress even in the two minute preparation phase.
---
Definitely clean up all the rotten leftovers and Chally poo, and put out the fires. They each cause the progress bar to go backwards faster. New Chally poo and fires can spawn every 30 seconds. The leftovers and the greens only spawn on event start.
---
Prime meat has no influence on event progress.
---
Optional: Put wood on the pile. You can do so every 30 seconds, but for relatively little progress.
---
Critters and veggies give the same progress, so collect them all and hand them in.
---
You don't need more than a handful of people hunting critters. Running around like a headless chicken doesn't help anyone. When you can't find critters and you don't see anything to clean up, or if you absolutely must AFK the event, get on a drum or spit.
---
You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you've lost twice. There's always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
---
THANKS
---
Long coat goes great with damn near everything doesn't it? I üëçüëç
---
Probably that ancient city in the lucky hole
---
came in this thread to basically say this, pretty much my go to method. it works!
---
Try asking on this discord server if you still need some help.
---
https://discord.gg/jK84K9
---
That‚Äôs what I was going to do back In January, just have a month, cram the scrap box. 
---
I‚Äôve still got it to this day lol. The QOL and atoms are pretty nice.
---
Xbox. It‚Äôs in my flair!
---
People not properly using the teams doesn't mean more shouldn't be added. Anytime I am a team leader especially in daily ops I kick those who don't participate. Also, not everyone has people they can play with. None of my friends have 76 so I can't just grab some friends and do it. I have to rely solely on randoms.
---
The Gauntlet is a little weaker than the Power Fist, Deathclaw gauntlet and Mole Miner's Gauntlet, seeing as it has the advantage of being far more readily available through crafting.
---
No, you are right about both. Me and Mama Dolce go way back.
---
If I find fusion cores for 50-80 caps 100% charged (part charged cores dont stack so I dont buy them) I will buy them all up every time, I could only find 12 for sale today while hoppy shopping, they seem to be losing charge faster after patch 22 I'm going through way more than usual it seems.
---
Great points. I said 1 on the grill and 1 on the drum because we only had 4 people. 1 afk on the grill, me on the drums (until I got desperate and went to put out fires then back to the grill again), and 2 headless chickens alternating killing critters and doing nothing ü§¢
---
For me is the stims, I carry 100+ to be able to heal the team (and randos) and I used to have the  chemist backpack, so every time a switched to heavy PA i instantly gained 200+ carry weight, recently I had to bite the bullet and move 3 points into strength so I can keep traveling pharmacy and don‚Äôt have to inventory manage every time I wanted the fight Earle and the queen
---
Primal cuts... all except one have hordes of mole-rats, no fun.
---
Cookout... nothing new there, and too much mole-rats for the 15 scrips.
---
Treasury notes? Maybe when I have a chance to turn in more than 20, as I'm sitting on more than 2k.
---
So no. That "event" is not for me.
---
My only issue with this would be people would definitely steal your nuke if you are the person on the team with the keycard. Or you'd all have keycards and all want to launch but only one of you actually could. Its a cool idea but it would probably be abused and people would get mad
---
They were trying to pretend it wasn‚Äôt a straight up port of fallout 4 and that they made it all from scratch to be bigger, better, and just work.
---
I‚Äôm sure in the next year, if things quiet down, we‚Äôll get a fallout 4 pack of assets to buy.
---
...the what now?
---
Heads up on the ipresentinterval tip, I tried it as well and it caused my character to get stuck in instances. As in my character would just randomly stop moving at all. I would have to go to third person and wiggle the camera around to free my character, ultimately I just deleted the line entirely and it fixed the problem.
---
I used to watch it more when I was 15/16 but Lisa Kelly was my hero. When they did the most dangerous roads and the trucks they had to drive, I was seriously so concerned every episode üòÇ then we lost Darrell Ward in a plane crash. ): He was starting a new show too during that. I have much respect for them and the jobs they do, thousands of people would be without daily living supplies if they didn‚Äôt make those dangerous runs each season!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My thoughts exactly!!
---
I remember my first solo run being level 40-ish or so. Ran out of fusion cores, over-encumbered, I had to carry a whole second set of power armor individually because the game wouldn't let me put the level 50 parts back on the frame and collect (I for some reason was given a Level 50 Ultracite Power Armor set by the game, and once I pulled it out I couldn't put it back in) and I died countless times.
---
Now I mainly avoid them and if needed I'll just glitch into it lmao, I know it takes away from it but I just wanna be able to provide Scorchbeast Queen for everyone asap
---
Yes, of course, prime meat, intestines, drums, and grill.
---
Could always just switch the order they appear in your pip-boy.
---
Make sure to cook all the meat you find and sell unneeded before it rots
---
Sadly I'm Pc, or I'd help you out. There are 2 market reddits for Fallout76 you could try.
---
Holy shit fam
---
I‚Äôve never let them live long enough to listen to them loo
---
Good luck finding a melee build willing to play the game, in the last week i met two melee builds and majority of players are either PA heavy guns or sneak build crouching and one hitting everything. Before the patch just as after melee builds is pretty weak i mean that was great dealing 1700 to end game bosses but you get one shot by a lot of movs because of mobs or missing animations and if i were you i'd drop the 2h melee build the slow swing for 300 isn't worth it pick up unarmed if you can, it's  swinging faster and if you find a bloodied power fist you'll deal the most damage
---
Maybe I‚Äôm not carrying items I can sell: but if you can sell stimpaks then idk; I‚Äôm on now so I‚Äôm going to try it.
---
Chemist backpack and sell chems. I don‚Äôt even go out of my way to sell for caps anymore, I just sell when I need to drop weight and I still hit the daily cap way before I‚Äôm done playing. The game throws tons of chems at you now, especially stimpaks.
---
For example I will do one rad rumble and loot enough glowing blood to sell for like 600 caps.
---
I don't use any weapons or armor that needs them, so they are pretty much worthless to me...except that they take up inventory/stash space for me, so I price them low because I want then gone. I will usually just drop them if charge is &lt;50, and then 10-20 caps after that depending on charge.
---
This. I ditched Junkies for AA and haven't looked back. The One Wasteland update changed everything. 
---
AA Exploding, Suppressor, Forceful, Hardened, Aligned, Stinging.
---
Generic 'it's other people's fault' without saying why. 
---
You were one of those eight so accept you have a 12.5% share of the blame.
---
Yh I did it with a shit ton of stealth boys and crit shots died more time than I can count
---
And yet they are still TOO heavy even with the perk .
---
Lmao you can solo the meat week event at level 1 with a literal stick if you failed it there is only one peasant here
---
And I always wanted one as a pet.....
---
6 of the 8 people there did nothing.
---
Of course, if you say anything here there spelling fairies and sarcasm fairies comment. 
---
Never change reddit.
---
Never.
---
We can already achieve the ghoul state with current perks. One of them is literally vault boy turning into a ghoul for the animation. All it needs is a skin swap on the character. This doesn‚Äôt need to be implemented from concept or it won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll also note other online games have no issues adding entirely different races, so, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôd be possible. Even if it wasn‚Äôt pretty much implemented in game already.
---
Awesome! Have fun! :)
---
You can sell stimpaks. Hopefully it works for you, I'd put in a ticket if it doesn't though I don't know how much help it'll actually be
---
Sounds like FO76 marketplace lol
---
Excellent comeback tool, like that makes anything I said invalid.
---
Reminds me of the raiders in Springvale in Fallout 3 trying to dig into the vault.
---
Scrip needs to stay, since Gold Bullion only becomes available after completing the Wastelanders main questline, but setting up exchange rates between currencies wouldn't be too bad of an idea.
---
Also scrip ties in nicely with the mining theme of the game, and especially Mole Miners.
---
He‚Äôs not the little pricks who jerk you around and make you grind the same daily mission over and over, so I would have too.
---
2:17 "I'll tear your face off"
---
Well its gone from my mission list so i cant do it.
---
Stay negative reddit.
---
When you are selling your loot make sure you have hard bargain equiped &amp; knock back a grape mentat
---
Statistically use ghoulish, what rads, and maybe aqua boy/girl and you are a ghoul in all but looks. I think maxing ghoulish should cause a skin swap to a ghoul skin. Easy, simple, it‚Äôs all in game already.
---
I hope the settlers jump you too
---
I assume it would be the super mutants.
---
The wiki says it's us, and the green ones are super mutants.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, i know you have gotten a lot of tips from the great fallout community already but here are a couple.
---
1) scrapping the abundance of weapons you won‚Äôt need will give you recipes for making weapons better.
---
2) this fallout let‚Äôs you level up each special to a max of 15 giving you 1 point until level 50 so I recommend looking up builds before you get too far like I did, although it‚Äôs not required and you can pretty much wing it if you want.
---
3)I recommend looting anything with lead, steel, and gunpowder because you can go through ammo quickly and those are needed to craft more.
---
If you even need any help I‚Äôm not a high level but I‚Äôm always down my psn is Silkk-1.
---
You're the one bitching
---
hunters long coat
---
Lmao he got what he had coming. Also, I'm sorry to do it but I have to.
---
Stimpak*
---
Lol sorry
---
It comes up again whenever you launch a nuke.
---
Yea its like peeling your own plastic off a new appliance. Its yours to do.
---
Dwarves are a very good example of why digging to deep can be a very bad thing.Unless of course you want to unearth a very bad thing......
---
Sometimes the mall vendors in white spring has it. I‚Äôve also seen them on the vendor bot by Rose. Graham can too.
---
Will you be on ps4 at all this weekend? I think i need help.
---
you don't see the logic in paying for a year which is 20% cheaper than paying each month?  maybe that's the root of your financial problems then.  and as others have said if you struggle to make a $15 (usd since i apparently needed to specify that for you) payment a month then you really shouldn't be doing it in the first place.  the sub is optional.  The most annoying thing in games that have optional subs is the people complaining about the price of it as if they're forced to play it.  this isn't ffxiv or wow, you can play without it.  do you ask your landlord or whoever you make rent payments to if they can reduce the rent and take out the kitchen access or knock out a bedroom or two?
---
This is 100% still an issue - I just logged on and my camp is completely destroyed and this is the second time it's happened in the last 2 days because my camp is near Monongah mine (it was there before the event, but now it's getting nuked every 5 mins) - logging off doesn't stop the nuke destroying my camp. This is a nightmare.
---
I'll give them a try. I've server hopped 10 times and Graham has yet to have them for me.
---
It would make sense to an extant, as the Interloper, or rather Ug-qualtoth, seems to be calling to various mutants and psykers alike- ghouls, moleminers, the priests and priestess of the Mothman cult. That being said, the moleminers supposedly have a vast underground network that covers most of Appalachia, surely they would have found it before the cultists if they had heard the call, or are heeding the call as they dig.
---
Most of these types of players run with a team. So each person does 3.
---
Silo run (glitched) is about 15 min. Maybe 10-15min for nuke to drop, queen fight &amp; cleanup. After 75-90 min (and 3 nukes), change servers, next person does the same.
---
You have to remember how early in the history 76 is. 
---
Future generations would actually have more antiquated speech because of generations of learning from outdated books and vault learning modules. 
---
Current residents are direct survivors or their descendants so language is still a lot more raw and unfiltered.
---
I joined the Mothman for a feast.
---

---
This is incorrect I can still buy from a vendor if it has no power, your vendor icon just wont show on the map.
---
I was in the same boat, and got the game a month ago or so.   
---
I love it. It is great. It is very much fallout, everyone I have met has been pretty nice and helpful, it's a lot of fun. Exploring some more of the lore of Fallout is even more fun with my wife and friends.
---
well shit... know the feeling but sorry but dont think so
---
im certain a lot of player wish they could undo something like that.. well im one of them
---
No you can still buy stuff just no map icon.
---
That's why I like these special events less often. After a week of Fasnaught and Meat Week it becomes a little stale. I do enjoy them as it brings the server together, but the longer they run folks don't care so much.
---
Quick fix would be to change up the rare rewards to keep more players involved.
---
Wait!!! Even better idea: Funko POP! figures.
---
I can tell you straight up that the Mothman Funko figure is honestly admittedly kinda cute in its own way - to bad it's eyes don't glow in the dark üôÅ
---
Damn sorry, am on pc
---
That would work for me.
---
Was just thinking that
---
Now, now, she can sometimes give out god tier loot, but if all she gave us was god loot, then it wouldn't be god loot would it? "When everyone's super, no one is."
---
I Love Grahm and If BoS messes with him, I‚Äôll drop a nuke on them lol
---
Dude I literally have nothing and I‚Äôve had it for 10 minutes
---
i pay 100 for 100% charge and -1 per charge % lower then that so 99 for a 99% charge. and so on, i wouldn't sell anything less then 50 % charge , and your better off having them in stacks. if someone sees a stack of 50 % charge ones they are more likely to buy them compared to a bunch around that number but not stacked 
---
now if they are crafted ones so they are actually 150% charge then i would pay 150 for them 
---
this is also how much i sell them for when i have them for sale
---
Huntersville mutants.
---
My first thought was aliens, but supermutants probably make more sense.
---
I got a major score last night at a player vendor.
---
B E 90 Tesla for pennies but I don't want to use it if it affects other peoples game badly.
---
Keep harassing support until they comply, don‚Äôt play the game while you‚Äôre doing this so they can easily revert your character to an earlier save.
---
The fun is just starting. You really want some pain? Get to 100.
---
In that modded to either polished or alloyed ( I forget which), a full set  heavy metal armor has the best DR of any armor other than Butressed SS, and beats out some PA, as well as having pretty good ER and RR, yea, metal armor is actually pretty darn good :)
---
I used heavy metal for well over 100 levels, traded it out for SS.
---
What‚Äôs the exact link to get to support I couldn‚Äôt find it?
---
I don't know what to say to you but it definitely can happen and has happened to me three times this week, once a few days ago, once yesterday, and it happened again today (I logged off at my camp while it was intact, and just logged back on a few hours later and it's completely ruined). There is zero chance I'm not right about my experience here, 8 hours ago I logged off at my camp and I just logged back on after getting home and it's nuked.
---
Definitely didn't get nuked just as I joined, this is something that happened after I logged out
---
5c a piece is virtually giving them away :P
---
Call it Raid lol
---
weird, must have bugged with the patch &gt;.&gt; cuz if it has no power then it's suppose to not allow other players to see what's in it or buy from it.
---
I am just done with the event period I've played it at least 20 times now and every time I get only a 1 star gun or armor not a single 2 or 3 star has dropped and to add to it I've had events that no matter what we do the bar keeps dropping. So done wasting ammo
---
You do know there‚Äôs two types of fireman uniforms right?
---
Probably I misunderstood, but I took the OP more literally, so I meant actually becoming a ghoul, like permanently going from RaceHuman to RaceHumanGhoul, or RaceSuperMutant for that matters (names are examples, I don't actually know how the entries for Fallout races are called in the GECK, I have way more experience modding Skyrim), not workaround solutions, for which I bet there are enough scars and damages in the character creation that one could be able to emulate the Ghoul skin, at least for the face. Only need an outfit with gloves to hide the hands, and the ghould build is good to go.
---
The fact is that it wouldn't be possible or wouldn't make sense to actually become ghouls in 76 if those changes aren't permanent, and humans can get all the benefits with Perks, and it would harm the game to remove choices from players and to rebrand those choices as permanent changes. Nothing should be permanent in 76 because the game wasn't built with these premises from the start and it would be a disaster to impose them afterwards.
---
All 76 can do is workaround solutions, and implementing implants to support more varied play styles.
---
I'm for it if it's the size of the Legendary Pail Mole Miner Backpack so it blocks everyone's view.
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
My build at the time was just damage, no stealth bonus, no crit, just damage.. Now I'm a Bloodied Stealth Build after realizing I don't like being shot and I glitch my way through the silo so I can grant everyone the sweet embrace of a beasts corpse
---
The only line I've ever heard them say clearly was "You're dead!"
---
Nobody asked you to come here and bitch about it...
---
This is a great tip, thanks!
---
Awe maaaaaaaaaaaaan
---
when you finish vault 79 mission you get to trade gold bullions for stuff... plans mostly but some other stuff as well...
---
before you finish vault 79 you cant do anything with it... you can trade in vault 79 with secret service agent, then there is samuel? think his name is, in foundation, and in crater but not sure whos or where it is in crater
---
That's big talk for someone that dies in 3 50 cal rounds.
---
This is pretty cool actually
---
TY vid...shouldn't that be YT? Silly autocorrupt.
---
I‚Äôm already using those, I want to look the part too! Right now I just have to pretend that underneath my deep mining mask and outfit I‚Äôm a ghoul.
---
What bothered me is the social justice raider meg, like you murder people for their 5 caps and cram, don‚Äôt talk to me about accepting people no matter if they‚Äôre different, lol.
---
I try help best I can though, any questions just shoot away :)
---
Please. My chemist mod let me overlook I‚Äôd farmed 500  stims and psycho. I don‚Äôt have stash space. Why can‚Äôt I, at the very least, apply it as a mod to the head or chest piece? Why can I carry more then my modded excavator with it‚Äôs set bonus of bonus carry weight and focus on carrying shit?
---
Not even worth breaking out the pa. 
---
And I can‚Äôt sell chems‚Äô faster than I get and use them. DO leaves me with a surplus every time and vendors don‚Äôt have enough. It‚Äôs a separate issue,but fuck I‚Äôm tired of having to stop playing or just trash everything I earn because I max out vendors, scrip turn ins, bullion turn ins and my stash and still get valuable shit I have to treat as garbage.
---
Honestly what I was going for, it‚Äôs a good perk Combo. Thanks to the way what rads works I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one of the nicer perks from the legendary selection. Having maxed it, and wearing ss armour (vanguards) with mostly rad resist bits, without rad shield I had rads down to 15/sec in a nuke zone..so in reality 9/second which is manageable

You're in the Facebook group too aren't you?

1. I'll drag you into heaven

Meat hook used to double dip into unarmed and one handed but they fixed that at the beginning of the year.

Its now only an unarmed weapon.

Bethesda has said that it will continue to evolve. For example, the Treetops (I think that‚Äôs it) has changed. Big Bend Tunnel is different. The west end has an enclosed area that will probably be instanced. 
---
The Wayward is new. 
---
West Va Lumber company is different. 
---
Watoga has a new resident. 
---
The farm/buildings north of the Nuka-Cola plant are different, with a posted sign telling us that the prior residents are returning. 
---
Atlas Observatory is different now. 
---
And so on. Some of these didn‚Äôt change at the launch of Wastelanders. That shows me that there are changes along the way. 
---
Perhaps it will at some point meet your expectations. And to be honest, these intermittent additions feel more organic than if the entire area changed all at once.
---
I got them on my second character recently.
---
Wastelanders added, at best, about 3 hours of "content", and pushes the game even more into being singleplayer. 
---
"You thought that not being able to quest together and get updates was bad? Wait until we introduce that nothing is tradeable now!".
---
Just like nobody asked you to comment.
---
When Get into my pa, excavator focused on mods for carrying, I end up hundreds of pounds over carry weight. It‚Äôs ridiculous. I can carry the suit of pa, but using it makes me worst at its specialized function.
---
Yep. Make sure to have starched genes though so you dont lose them
---
Ah, you have a mighty aura
---
Should try playing on console, at max setting it's like your stuck in glue.
---
Microsoft ruined this franchise when they released Fallout Tactics!!!
---
Shit makes me so mad!!!
---
Nothing that was tradeable before Wastelanders is non-tradeable now.
---
Yeah. But make sure you've got the skill that allows you to keep your mutations when you use radaway and other deradiation methods
---
I highly doubt you completed the Spec Ops in 1 minute 47 seconds.  I‚Äôd love to see a screenshot if you have one.
---
There's definitely a learning curve, but I'm sure with a few tune ups to your gear and build, you'll find One Wasteland pretty manageable. I was in the same boat, but then once I got a pretty good setup, I started really appreciating the bigger experience drops and better leveled loot from all over the map.
---
The responders and regular police uniform.
---
I had this very issue last week. I had to deactivate the quest, switch servers, then reactivate it. Then it told me to discover the fate of the brotherhood again.  But once I zipped through that at Fort Defiance, the quest sent me on to the DMV for my military ID like it should have.
---
Aaahhh I missed that. Sorry!
---
I got mine in white spring after a couple days looking. Kicked myself for not grabbing it when I saw it on a station vendor. All for the open sign, haha
---
I believe it should be right by Challey and look something like a pile of hay.
---
You can in the pip boy
---
Join me XxQuarantinaxX. I'm done today but always looking for new friends/teams to do ops
---
I mean if you are brand new, I‚Äôd say wait a little bit, Bethesda are gonna be readjusting one wasteland stuff to make leveling a little bit easier now. I know they were testing no food/drink on PTS at one time but that seems to have gone nowhere.
---
There are NPCs and some you can find randomly around the world, that‚Äôll normally give some flavor text or just generic dialog.
---
The games been out quite a bit so I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno lifing‚Äù it, because it‚Äôs easy to get a ton of exp at higher levels. The highest I‚Äôve seen legit is 2300+(ish).
---
It doesn't work with the legendary modifier.
---
It works with actual explosives weapons like missile launchers, Fat Man and the like.
---
I've heard mixed reports on if it works with legendary explosive perks.
---
There's a trick with that gun. Charge it then hit vats and let go of the button.  7-8 times out of 10 every pellet will hit the mob. I call it my railgun build because it even shoots through walls and obstacles.  1 shot kills most things. Make a high ap build with the 2 luck abilities, 1 that add crit bar per hit that makes every other shot a crit, and the other makes it so vats kills refill AP. Pair it with a magic gauss shotgun like instigating, limb dmg, 25 less vats cost and it is a lot of fun to play.  Increasing the weapons accuracy seems to cause it to happen less frequently and running and jumping while doing it seems to make it happen more.
---
Been running that build for close to two years it does rather well.I have a good enough swing speed with it and when I one shot most things what difference does it make.Unarmed would mean giving up PA besides because of that PA I do not get one shot or two shot etc etc.It takes really special circumstances for me to die.I also don‚Äôt run bloody as I am not a fan of gimmick builds.None of my toons are bloodied.
---
If we are talking about problems with the game this could be at the top of the discussion. Everybody‚Äôs answer to combat in this game is bloodied.Why?Because min maxing is a thing and they must speed through the game as fast as possible and make it as easy as possible.Oh this one mechanic staggering is disrupting that please give me immunity to it.
---
Thanks I looked everywhere üôÑ
---
On the pile next to where Chally roams closer to the tree that has some crates and containers.
---
Exactly why I made the topic.....
---
I do more then my share twice today, and people afk sit on drums.   So why wouldn't anybody complain or bitch? 
---
Don't do events if you aren't going to do anything.  Wtf is the point?
---
You still looking for someone?
---
You can have as many or as few as you like but I have maxed out mutations early thanks to lots of dieing while swimming in my local river. They balance out pretty nicely once you have them all but for best results it's preferable to be a little more selective which I will be doing once I've gotten one or two more recipes..
---
But why? Only two bombs fell on Appalachia.
---
I mean the perk should make you a ghoul. Do a skin swap since you bought into the ghoul effects. I guess it‚Äôs kind of a work around, but story wise it makes more sense you become a ghoul over time then start as a vault ghoul.
---
I just think your monitor is a bit wonky?
---
I couldn't figure out why the meter wasn't filling, turns out the other four people were on the drums and spit. I collected as much as I could of both items and cleaned as I went and turned everything in at one time to complete
---
What is so bad about making some gear non tradeable? Have you never played any other MMO-ish games? That is pretty standard for them.
---
The energy absorption heals you as well btw, so you can sit in front of an assaultron, so you‚Äôll charge your FC and stay max health
---
There's someone staying in the Charleston Fire Dept building as well with an actual name and some dialogue.
---
NW is not that scary honestly. It's not personal. Bush wookie, carefly moving from bush to bush, is a valid strategy, since the mode awards you nore for surviving than killing. I won one match because I collected aid following the shrinking map until it ended in the middle of the lake. It was only me and 2 other Aquaboys in the bottom of the lake at the end and I had stimpacks and radaway!
---
Alright cool. Thanks for the responses.
---
You can take all the serums at the same time if you wanted. 
---
However you can‚Äôt have carnivore and herbivore at the same time. Since they cancel each other out. So idk if you have one and then you take the other, I don‚Äôt know if it will replace the previous one. I‚Äôm not sure. 
---
A side note since you‚Äôre a ‚Äúnoob‚Äù
---
When you take a serum, it temporarily gives you all the benefits of the mutation, and none of the bad side effects. Eventually that fades away and you‚Äôll get the bad side effects too. 
---
In order for you to KEEP your mutations, without accidentally getting rid of them when you take a radaway or step into the decontamination shower is to equip and fully upgrade the perk called ‚Äústarched genes‚Äù It‚Äôs under luck skill tree.
---
Where you there at the beginning and prep the meter during the two minutes using the drums?  Did you clean up the waste piles and gather the greens before gathering critter chunks?  Did you drop off critter chunks and greens regularly or did you hold on to them until the meter dropped below the first reward or until the very end?
---
How about ALL center screen notifications.
---
I hadn‚Äôt seen them yet!  Thanks, I‚Äôll go check that out!
---
Yeah, I got some good advice in the comments here and I had a look at my stash. I had an unused Vampire's Exploding Handmade that I was gonna sell on the trade sub but I never got around to it. So I gave it an automatic receiver, got some Commando perks and it works quite well actually. Haven't tested it on a Prime Cuts event so far, but I managed to down a lvl 100 Behemoth in a really short time.
---
Yeah. Like I said, they should make it swap at the max rank of the perk, so you look like a ghoul. That‚Äôs all they need to do. If you buy the ghoul perk, make us look it.
---
Yes, sucks big time.
---
I wish we could favorite items without them being in the weapon wheel. I accidentally scrapped my power armor frame with lvl 50 t51b armor when I was lvl 40 and had to grind levels to free up the inventory space.
---
Bro, I literally do not care
---
So what sense does it make that those colonising are from PA, which we know got hit pretty damn hard based off The Pitt and Raven Rock from Fallout 3?
---
West Virginia hasn't had a non-player caused nuclear strike anywhere on the map. Hell, the most damaged area of the map, Charleston, was caused by a dam burst.
---
What flamer was it
---
Tse
---
Drums, the critter chunks and greens.
---
Nerd rage is a big plus!and it helps keep you alive
---
Oh thats OK then my fatman is a 2 shot anyway haha
---
Not a complete answer. 
---
When did you turn in the chunks/greens?
---
I tried it with the Chally Moo Moo mask. Can confirm, it goes with everything.
---
Is it supposed to do that?
---
Aren't we salty
---
Sorry that happened but I doubt anyone will give you a legacy flamer. I‚Äôve tried to trade for a legacy flamer numerous times and everyone wants to much. It‚Äôs the best gun in game right now. So I know it sucks but you won‚Äôt be able to have one given to you. I mean unless you find the nicest person. Who knows, I would def contact support
---
So it's not "Hrrb drur bur-bur, hurbuburuburuuuu"   
---
Cool
---
In addition to all these suggestions, learn where some cap stashes are and run and get them daily
---
&gt;I mean, all I hear is "HRHRMNRNRGG". 
---
All of them are retired deathcore band singers, that's why.
---
You can't get the responder fireman uniform from the main quest just the fire breathers uniform.
---
Watoga has had them. And like someone said graham has them sometimes. I just bought of bot in watoga for 9k I believe
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware yes, I haven‚Äôt heard them say anything about it being a bug or whatever.
---
There's 3 but take a upvote from me.
---
What's the wastelanders dlc ??
---
I'm just playing the normal game pass version
---
The legendary special perk cards will allow you to add i think a max of 5 points to up to 6 special stats, but not exceed 15. You can build with the assumption that you're going to finish out some specials. It's not really a hard game after 50, except some boss fights, so you won't miss it. It's best not to have to respec because you lose the perk card/points you would have gotten that level.
---
Interesting, I'll try that
---
No, their too spread out across the aid list to be able to drink them all at once.
---
You have to drink them one at a time.
---
But your free to have most of the mutations they cause ar once.
---
^  o^
---
Im looking at you single action revolver
---
HasNoStyle Xbox
---
üòÇüòÇ

That‚Äôs something they didn‚Äôt expect when releasing. The original plan was for a survival esc game where you set up defense to protect your camp and engage in a ton of PVP, but as we all know, that‚Äôs not how it turned out. I‚Äôve been on since the release I‚Äôve only ran into like 5 or 6 PvP encounters. Instead everyone is working together and building different shops, houses, diners, and a ton of other really creative builds to enhance the playing experience of others. The shops really turned the game around IMO as it allowed players to really interact with each other and explore the bases and wasteland more. Plus it created an economy in the game pretty much which is pretty cool in its own right. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun game because you can still be a power armor DOOM guy slaying ghouls, but you can also be a team helper build, entrepreneur (basically what I am), rare item collector, or live the hunter and gatherer life with a bow and melee weapon. Essay over
---
Apparently Bethesda confirmed somewhere it's an intended effect even though the perk card doesn't state it.
---
People Love 2 Hate this game - and for balance there are blinded Fanboys too who fail to acknowledge that some faults need fixing sooner rather than later. It's good but is too buggy to be great.
---
The weight limit is not a major issue if you can get past the OCD 'grab and store everything' phase. There's got to be tighter limits when it's online.
---
Food and drink negatives are due to removed in a future patch. Personally I think the penalties should be downgraded not scrapped completely as this is meant to be a survival game.
---
The games been out for nearly 2 years now and leveling up, especially with high Int, isn't so difficult. Until patch 22 with the introduction of Legendary Perks anything above L50 was simply for bragging rights anyway.
---
Have you ever been on a team with someone who logs off? Your camp disappears when you log out...
---
Was wondering about that.  Which is why I lock them and turn them off.  They could always pick the lock though or glitch in LOL
---
&gt;High end trades still trade for 2-6 characters worth of caps.
---
You operate in an entirely different market from the one Op is talking about.
---
Don't move toward the objective. Ignore everything and run like the wind. Don't stop to fight anything till you get to the objective
---
The miners are basically fallouts Skaven I feel like.
---
How many people are still selling these? I‚Äôd be interested in finding some deals.
---
There is literally a warning...
---
Dude,did you just make a whining bitching post and then complain about negativity? Ignorant or troll?
---
They won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Bro come on, I love the mole miners you can't tell me they have dialogue, and such mean dialogue, come on
---
used to be you would lose the mutations after a hr if you had starched geans active when u took them
---
I will never look at mole miners the same. üò≥üò≥
---
Either way completing in 00.01 or 07.59 results on the same chance of rare reward
---
This would probably pair well with cannibal right? Most of the time when I used cannibal id get much more rads than health back. So with this combo it'd be pretty good right?
---
I was very sad the 10mm SMG didn't have a suppressor. It would be a much better weapon with it.
---
That‚Äôs why you keep harassing them.
---
The only market that took a real hit is non meta items. Nocturnal and  suppressors and such. Those sell for 10-20 caps per scrip and have been for a while.
---
Which one?
---
Why not? What would the team bonus buff be?
---
Some enemies have a minimum level. You may have progressed farther in the story than your level. I think at level 16 you should be in Morgantown or Grafton (towards the north)
---
They still won‚Äôt do anything. There is literally a warning when you attempt to drop a weapon with a skin.
---
It‚Äôs not the nukes that got them, it was the scorch plague.
---
No. Netflix doesn‚Äôt offer you discounts because you don‚Äôt watch thrillers. Games aren‚Äôt going to offer discounts because you want to nitpick features.
---
Just read my previous reply whenever you make up another excuse.
---
I favorited it and thought it was warning me that I was dropping a favorite weapon
---
i remember those days.. &gt;_&lt;
---
Maybe they can just instance the silos
---
Two shot Fatman is also pretty fun to fire into crowds üòÜ
---
Yeah, the "fetch this, kill that" reputation grind was annoying. It's like these factions were just kind of duct taped into the existing game, which I suppose they were. I hate Ward's stupid face and if it weren't for the 11 daily scrip I'd probably never visit Foundation again.
---
I'd like to see more random encounters. Yesterday I randomly ran into a drunk settler who kept asking me for more alcohol, it was pretty funny. Some side quests related to wandering random NPCs would be fun. Or even just more randoms like the drunk guy.
---
I've joined in the middle of an op and the clock has most certainly not reset. There might well be a rare glitch that causes it but it's certainly not something I've seen or heard of before. If it happens you'll still be limited to that 1 OP as counting towards your rare reward daily roll.
---
Signs and letters is the plan, try whitespring vendors
---
I say no. I enjoy having the game lock up for 30 seconds at a time and seeing my corpse on the ground as the scorchedbeast queen shuffles around on my respawn screen. God you people are selfish.
---
I obviously understand that. With that said, it doesn't matter that the camp disappears when you leave. The problem happens regardless. I'm not saying it makes sense but there must be something to do with data leftover in the session even though the camp physically disappears. Neither of us are game devs so neither of us know, but there's something more to it than the physical camp, otherwise this bug could not happen.
---
Are you sharing a perk card? Also, are you sharing that one perk card that cures rads?
---
But they‚Äôre still on the drums long after the event has finished?
---
Like I said. It isn't legitimate. 
---
A player joined me during the end boss which reset the clock but not the whole mission. 
---
But I don't have a screenshot so I don't have any proof.
---
Here's some good advice,RUN!!! it the best game you will love to hate lol
---
Sorry, but you‚Äôre screwed.
---
Yeah I have no plans to keep playing this game :(
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get it. They imported basically everything from Fallout 4 and Far Harbor except the building items. Do they not work for some reason? Did they want to sell them to us later in the atom store? Who knows.
---
Drums first, then killed the rodents, turned in meat, picked up shit, put out fires, cleaned up, spit, then killed more rodents and turned in meat.
---
Of course, it's my fault because I was actually contributing.  I assume that is where we are going with this?  I've been in cookouts where I don't even get off the drums to turn in meat and they are over.  So idk, just r(I)diculous that with at least 8 people there, it can't get completed in time, no matter what I do.
---
It used to be a very popular spot to nuke because of the enemy density and the flux. 
---
It also has a few fairly flat areas that makes building a nice camp much easier than other places.
---
‚ÄúMake up?‚Äù There is literally a text warning saying you will destroy the weapon by dropping it.
---
really?? may I have a link?? :0
---
Then why are you commenting?
---
I guess I should of made the..... Don't make a ops team and then don't join ops post.  That would be better.....
---
I've been using BE gatlingwith +1 agility. I absolutely love it. Got it from a player vendor for like 1500 caps. I believe that was the best deal I've found so far
---
Yeah. I didn't think it was normal even for a glitch. 
---
And yes, if anything it is unfortunate because I got nothing and can't try to get anything more for the rest of today.
---
That's how reddit is
---
P l e a s e increase the stash weight to 1000 Bethesda were begging you
---
It works with legendary effects
---
I agree with this post.
---
In my opinion, there are two reasons for the current predicament.  The first is that Daily Ops (and Earle, because of the Cursed weapons) has contributed to a general glut of Legendaries.  It's a guaranteed way you can earn at least one after a few minutes of effort.  If you can solo it, you'll be swimming in them before long.  Get a couple 3\*s, and you're already halfway cleaned out for the day thanks to the increasingly archaic Scrip limit.
---
The second is that the odds of getting anything good from Murmrgh are so terrible, I suspect a lot of players have divested themselves of this system.  It's become par for the course.  You buy something from Murmrgh, you do a 180 and walk straight to the grinder.  It's ridiculous how stacked the odds are in favor of extremely heavy nonsense like Missile Launchers, Broadsiders, and the Fat Man.  After almost two years, rather than tweak the numbers and make these weapons into something decent, Bethesda seems content to use them to pad the junk Legendary pool.  That's sad.
---
Before One Wasteland, I felt I had settled into a decent pattern of selling Legendaries for Scrip.  I charged dirt cheap prices based on the stars.  Sometimes it was ostensibly *less* than I would make just selling them to Robovendors.  And, like clockwork, someone would buy me out.
---
That doesn't happen anymore.  I think people have so many Legendaries of their own to Scrip that they hit the daily limit very fast and have no need to buy more.  So, I've started selling a lot of these to the Robovendors for Caps now, because there's just no point anymore.
---
That actually bothers you? Weird thing to get upset over. I mean, it makes sense. Real life gangs aren't really known for their acceptance and tolerance of people from different backgrounds, so her making people aware she's not afraid to take in people who are different to survive will gain more followers. Plus, the group probably would have killed Lou long ago if she wasn't like that. And given the rhetoric from some these days that tries to blame all the world's evils on a specific group (ahem), it's nice to see she realizes all people are capable of evil.
---
No, my luck is sucky too I've rolled maybe 50-60 gauss miniguns and only yesterday did I get a Primed Furious FFR FR, which is making my Primed TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal)  look weakish, but keep making them and your prayers will be answered.......one day.
---
Not at all. Just be sure to stick with the group so you can help with the uplinks, and tag as many of the enemies as you can so you earn xp. Revive other players if they get downed, and you'll be more helpful than 75% of the high level players that do the ops. 
---
Be sure you don't open the post mission report right away. I made that mistake my first few ops. You can run around and loot the corpses for ammo and stims fora few minutes before the op closes.
---
Not all kicks are the leaders fault. I've lead 2 man teams that claimed I kicked the 2nd when I did nothing. If its happening repeatedly I would try starting your own team and see if it drops you. Perhaps DOs have tighter lag limits than general play. 
---
Also check you aren't sharing unwanted perk cards. Some Bloodied players react angrily if you revive them and cure all their rads and won't hesitate to kick (FYI I'm Bloodied and although its annoying I simply take it as as a rare risk when teamed with randoms).
---
One of my camps is in the forest really close to the wayward and overseers camp so I get new players all the time. All of my water purifiers are free and I have one vending machine that‚Äôs free. I usually just drop 38 and 44 ammo along with a few outfits. 90% of the time its high level players that grab the free ammo. If a low level had a camp near me and they are there I‚Äôll drop a bag of ammo, stims and a low level legendary weapon, I can‚Äôt count the times another player ran up and grabbed the bag before they could get to it
---
I really want to see a deeper break down on this and demolition expert.
---
Theres so many things that these 2 perks should be affecting now but am never quite sure if they actually are.
---
Legendary perk cards, legendary weapon affixes, explosive weapon types, various Grenade types, 
---
If I was more certain of which they did or didn't boost I'd be better equipped for various scenarios.
---
As it stands now I tend to equip them because just maybe they're helping my currently equipped selection.
---
Stay salty my friend.
---
Thanks, will give it a shot
---
So, by you commenting it makes you feel some sort of way? Like, if you have nothing to add, why comment?   "because that's how reddit is?"   sad.
---
It has the raw potential to be so much more though.
---
Their leaving money on the table by not beefing up some of the games various aspects.
---
Before you decide on which faction to befriend and if you are patient do dailys, you can increase both sides to friendly before you do the Wastlanders mission to choose who to storm the vault with. You can get both sets of rewards. I'm working on boosting the raiders because I know I always help settlers in the end üòÖ Good Luck!
---
Keep commenting, I'm sure you have nothing better to do, or to try to be constructive, or anything remotely helpful.
---
Nope.....go to 1000 and people will start asking for more.
---
Once you have carnivore or herb if you take the other it will not change your mutation. The first one you took will be permanent unless you lose the mutation
---
I believe it cuts it in half. I use it until I'm over encumbered that change to HC. Is the grind worth it? That's up to you. You can just bounce to a trade sub and buy one for caps.
---
Sweet, good to know.
---
I role play everything and ignore the stats. My ‚Äúhalf ghoul‚Äù scavenger character has several metal armor pieces. I just assumed they were not great, since I never pay attention to numbers.
---
This entire post wasn‚Äôt remotely constructive. What are you on about?
---
No problem. She doesn't have a ton to say,  but you can worm some supplies from her (I think). She's very enthusiastic about the Firebreathers. Lol.
---
Definitely works with explosive legendaries. The explosive damage on my gatling gun went from doing 2 to 8 per tic.
---
You seem unable to interpret the /s symbol, or lack the clicking skills to reveal it
---
I scripped atleast 5-6 good 3 star bloodied gauss minis, now if only we could trade the weapons with people that know the plan, coz sometimes I just dump them as I'm maxed on scrip and space, which is a shame.
---
Nope can‚Äôt share any perks only have 1 charisma and I‚Äôm also bloodied
---
Two Shot increases recoil and hip fire spread. And you only get a 25% damage boost in the extra shot.
---
While AA Basically increases the damage of your gun because the more armor you break the more damage goes thru. 
---
Both are good just depends on what you want
---
Magic armor effect would be "reduced damage by 15% while blocking" on any armor limb.
---
Where do I get the plans for the mirror ball
---
The melee are the worst, ‚ÄúLets kill this motherfucker‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tear you spears, spread your guys on the floor‚Äù
---
I havent had that happen or if it has hadn't noticed
---
Not true actually, the UKs current queen is on our coins
---
Ahh that may be why. People are picky about perk sharing.
---
It's like a restaurant that was given all the best ingredients in the world. Like high class saffron and such... and they hired a McDonald's cook.
---
But there is nobody behind my back
---
Only if theres no loss in stability.
---
I can‚Äôt share perks I have 1 charisma after changing build around for bloodied commando before nerf. I know what you mean on perks because I‚Äôve been on teams that have my rads go away. So that‚Äôs not it but I guess it happens but also other day I figured it happened by accident so I joined again and he kicked me again. Idk
---
I didn't say the word discount. I would just like different features. Just like I subscribed to Shudder instead of Netflix because it has more of what I want, I would pay the same price for an option which had content I actually want.
---
Silver lining, it probably would have been useless as a fallback with one wasteland.
---
Sometimes when I stimpak a downed teammate the next inanimate object I point at with have their gamertag instead of the object name. Related somehow?
---
When that happens you usually have time to server hop and catch the event twice
---
I honestly expected them to release more subscription plans. I mean, why choosing 1st when the big patch it was supposed to ship with gravitates around gold, and not also release a Fallout 2nd, or even a Fallout 3rd? Why then not simply Fallout Gold, or Plus? It appears obvious to me that they purposefully left the door open to expand on the framework of 1st.
---
I honestly I'm not interested in private servers at all, so I would never buy 1st because for what I'd use it's overpriced and coming from an originally not too well-off family, I don't like to waste money, but I would definitely consider buying a subscription that takes private servers out of the equation, possibly a little less atoms, for about half the price.
---
It would be a win-win situation since it's private servers that costs Bethesda money and resources, a Fallout 2nd sub would be 100% gain and would attract more customers than 1st, while not taking away too much from the other subscription, since it still has its big selling point in private servers for those who want them.
---
Honestly the only way I can see them release a new subscription service and it not causing apocalyptic levels of backlash would be if they release it with the long-promised added features of 1st, among which is this game's version of mod support.
---
Level 46 and you need it maxed to reduce negative mutation effects to the lowest limit.    
---
I has no effect on Herbivore or Carnivore.
---
Heavy Gunner, coz I'm here to kick ass.
---
There‚Äôs a wall glitch to get into daily ops and stop the timer so it may have been something to do with that . But 80% is 80% either way .
---
Dont lol. Game is a cash cow with no real value. I honestly cannot recommend enough against it. And this comes from a Fallout Fanatic who has a collective of over 8000 hours of fallout throughout the decade. Youd be better to play fallout 4 imo. But hey youre a grown adult, in the end its your decision but as I said I cannot recommend it at all.
---
It's better then back in the vault raid times.
---
I‚Äôm getting 4 ultrcite fusion core per elder run that 8min a day..  
---
You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúfarm‚Äù them just ply regularly and they will build up
---
Graham tells people what to do in his bad English. He's not that smart so if people can't do it......üòÜ
---
The train wreck was more like Captain Marvel tanking on Rotten Tomatoes. People with an agenda highlighted/exaggerated the problems while pretending the good parts didn't exist. 
---
My one complaint is that rng IS endgame gear progression. Pretty much all games use rng for end game weapons, but it's not the weapon itself that's random, it's your chances of getting the item to progress the quest. Here, it's rolling the legendary dice over and over.  You can get amazing 3 star weapons like a Troubleshooter's Gamma gun with limb damage and bashing.
---
In Alyx (source 2), you can bring items with you or put them in the inventory.
---
Change time so that it coincides with everything else. Most you need is two people, and can easily get Elder in sub 7 minutes, no need for a full team, and even then the second person is just for the timers on Alpha and Bravo.
---
I use way more than 4 per day, also sometimes you only get 2.  But I tend to use around 10 a day, only do ops once to get elder.
---
BUT! 1k is a magic number.
---
It's clean and looks good, it also has enough zeros to go around.
---
No point asking for more.
---
Cant offer anything up that cool but ur free to run with me till you're re equipped.
---
PaladinCiel on xbox.
---
Will keep an eye out for interesting flame weapons too.
---
I was gonna give a peep a medic explosive fixer the other day because I remembered he was looking for an explosive one, and destroyed it too thinking I was just confirming the drop for a favorited item.
---
We were both mortified.
---
Sounds like they did the wall glitch and some one joined and started the clock
---
With enemies being leveled now using a knife on weak enemies instead of your gun probably wouldn‚Äôt of worked.
---
Silver lining. Every cloud has a silver lining. There‚Äôs something decent even in the bad.
---
Not sure which part you didn‚Äôt get, so two explanations. Just ignore the one that doesn‚Äôt apply.
---
Well to be fair I don‚Äôt play more then 2hours per day..
---
...oh what? That's what they said?? Oh hell....
---
If i remember correctly, Beth said that the game is currently working as intended.
---
I don't think adding a bit more extra stash size would hurt.
---
Well I got the legendary perk for perception so I can move perception points over to charisma so I can actually share. I use to have 8 charisma for almost a year and a half being I figured we would need high charisma in this game. But def didn‚Äôt for so long. And then I switch and public teams come out. But maybe that‚Äôs it, idk. I‚Äôm level 350 I doubt I would share anything that isn‚Äôt already getting shared. But thanks for the input, maybe I will have a better time when I move points around. Thanks again
---
It's in the game files. :) Confirmed.
---
Take your time to play, if you get stuck, juat slap on a mic and ask someone in game
---
Think I have a junkies flamer and maybe another variant...xbox
---
I hate wall spawns. It frustrates me on workshop defense. It‚Äôd infuriate me on something timed.
---
I just didn't get the very end of your comment "with one wasteland". Also, melee is far from useless- I may not be built for it yet, but it is still quite useful.
---
Since soloing the ops isn't all that difficult, I'm not sure why it would matter to you that someone is freeloading? Are there more enemies or something when you're multiple players?
---
I‚Äôm aware of that. But just the time it takes for the uplinks to fill is longer than that.
---
I would cut out live giver if you're a bloodied build. I'm a bloodied heavy power armor build and my endurance just has radcool and rank 3 fireproof and take your extra points and put them into strength
---
Dude really?
---
Yep, I have 25-30k ultracite 2mm EC rounds and have to carry them forever as they wont go in my stash, good job it pisses rounds out like a race horse....
---
I couldn‚Äôt complete Vital Equipment yesterday, because the Blood Eagle with the loot clipped into the ground when I blasted him.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any evidence either, but a reputable twitch streamer I watch (BattleStation1) insists that he and some friends tested it and were able to access the stash of players who had their vendors up. He won‚Äôt tell people how, which is a doubled edged sword, as it‚Äôs hard to believe something without seeing it yourself, but would also keep the information private in case other people wanted to use that information maliciously.  
---
In any case, he knows far more about fallout than most people I‚Äôve seen, so I trust him on it and my vendor is disabled.
---
Kudajo mate.
---
Nice stuff, and I hope those artistic dreams play out real some day.
---
Im not a bug man who spazzes out at any themes of social justice, she‚Äôs a killer, I‚Äôm not taking any moral grandstanding from her.
---
It really does suck, I wanna see if I can get my friend to give me a gun that‚Äôs decently usable
---
Although,  I tend to only walk away with tato salads and never any prime beef food.
---
Isn't the point of a cook out to offer food for friends and family?  XD
---
I use to use my private world all the time when I first got fallout first last year. Now only time I use it is to transfer stuff to my other character. I could get down with the idea of different types of subscription
---
Idk the market for legendaries is fu@ked every day players that have good weapons sitting in stash only trade there isnt even a reason to sell for caps.i rather gift my legendaries to random people on the server.as far as legacy's if I want one I can buy one for 10 to 15 bucks rtm kinda sucks but it is what it is
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say better, just less bad. It‚Äôs still far to lax for me
---
How shitty is their code they can‚Äôt get it stable for inventory after years? Other online games don‚Äôt seem to have this impossible struggle. Shit, early 2000 wow didn‚Äôt have devs refusing bank space for stability and never working on it.
---
Don‚Äôt enable shit development. Demand they get their shit together and get on par with competitors if they want some mo, no mmo cause 24 isn‚Äôt exactly massive, money.
---
You can buy more than 10 vault steel in a day by just switching server
---
I can make you any selection of modified non legendary guns you could need. And will keep an eye open for upgrades.
---
Really basic guns are enough to get quite far so long as you have the right perks backing them up.
---
I want a recipe for that tato salad from Bethesda. It still gives me benefits with Carnivore.
---
They did say it‚Äôs working as intended.
---
Wrong one bud grenadier is meant to affect explosion radius but there's very conflicting views on if it does or doesn't
---
Noice
---
The new patch that scales enemies. I too used to melee ghouls in the forest. Now everything is 50+ and too tough to not use my spec weapons.
---
have those
---
And I carry  at least 8 weapons for use on different enemies
---
anti ammo  explosive 50 cal furious m79 grenade launcher ,black diamond  furious Bowie knife  ,furious combat shotgun  lever action 2 shot rifle and western revolver   plus food water ammo and meds
---
and have strong back /pack rat maxed out
---
EDIT -plus furious LMG
---
Ah, my bad then. Ignore me.
---
I know a couple of people who sub and they have only ever used their private worlds once or twice when they first subbed for the sheer novelty of it, but quickly returned to the normal world for the same reason I enjoy the normal world : interaction with other random players. I can understand the want for a private world for some people, but it's definitely not a selling point for a lot of people.
---
Oh look an angry gamer boy.
---
Take your attitude and gtfo. go watch some jim sterling or some shit. /eyeroll
---
Ever noticed that sweet buns do too?
---
Just what are those things made of???
---
He picked the lock. It‚Äôs open now and needs to be locked again.
---
Some people just don't get it. Lol
---
[visible concern]
---
The bug does not happen. Something else explains whatever you are seeing.
---
You should invest some points into melee perks. It may take a while, but it cuts back on ammo usage a lot, and actually saves you a helluva lot of ammo in the long run.
---
True that.
---
The buying of said item is the issue. If someone wants to waste stash space selling for that much so what.
---
That's 100% what happened!
---
What‚Äôs your gt
---
I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing thank you!  Personally I still think the crafting cost and unnecessary need for the steel is a bit odd / janky
---
Don‚Äôt think so. Not too surprising when you can‚Äôt even use laser rifle skins for the ultracite laser rifle variant
---
So your legendary weapon lost it's legendary attributes?  
---
I suggest you send a support request to bethesda. Hopefully they can get you your Knife back.
---
Been there, done that...twice in fact as the boss at my very first solo DO spawned inside a machine, thankfully I could still shoot his arm and win albeit well outside the time limit.
---
That‚Äôs why I was thinking about it myself. I just wasn‚Äôt sure about it because I don‚Äôt see laser weapons that often.
---
I'm pretty sure Graham sells the plan for it. One of the vendors at whitesprings probably do as well so you should be able to get one pretty easily :)
---
If worst comes to worst, I'm like 90% sure I can craft one so if you're on pc i might be able to help.
---
If you're lucky grahm will have them during this meat week. Id say you should try server hopping and keep talking to him to see what he has to offer. He has some cool plans like the radiation emitter, marquee arrows, suitcases
---
Yes I got 100 right off the bat!
---
That‚Äôs not what I was getting at. Just because other people are giving you a hard time, that doesn‚Äôt mean I was doing that. 
---
I was pointing out a viable strategy to complete the event, even if you‚Äôre doing it solo. Turning in the chunks/greens periodically isn‚Äôt a good strategy. Only do so when the meter is at like maybe 25% or when the timer is almost out. 
---
Cleaning up the piles/garbage/fires early is important because while those exist, the meter degrades *faster*. Once those are cleaned up, the meter drops a LOT slower. 
---
If no one else is participating, then getting on the spit or drums is a poor decision after the first two minutes. 
---
- Drums during the 2 minute prep. 
---
- From the stage, bear left and go clockwise around the area, gathering greens and cleaning up piles/garbage/fires. 
---
- When you get to the area behind the drums, kill the critters and collect. 
---
- Continue clockwise circuit around area killing critters and putting out fires. 
---
- If meter drops below 25%, turn in the greens first. Don‚Äôt turn in chunks. 
---
- Continue circuit and only do chunks turn in if it drops below the 1st reward. 
---
- If timer gets to less than 20 seconds, go turn in the chunks. 
---
This is one of the best strategies and has served me well, even on solo runs. 
---
So, was the event failure your fault?  If you weren‚Äôt using a good strategy, then yes, it was partially your fault. If you want to do better, then listen to the advice being given. 
---
Your choice.
---
"He‚Äôs there pretty often actually, I‚Äôve had it where he doesn‚Äôt even attack you at times. Moth Home near Harpers Ferry."
---
Comment by another user and this is how and where it happened.
---
Ok, How many caps is it normally?
---
I personally don't like them but if they were useful, sure.
---
Keep in mind, that 40s/50s aesthetic was basically propaganda pushed on the populace to keep them happy in the face of mass shortages. People were already starting to riot against the government near the end, once the bombs fell all that veneer would fall by the wayside.
---
Later generations in the wasteland who grew up on the surviving media &amp; wishing for ‚Äúbetter times‚Äù would be the ones who think that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre supposed to talk.
---
I hope so too. I'll look into sending one their way. Thank you.
---
Exactly this!   I would run Leader of the Pack anytime it came up just so I could drop low level legendaries for newbies...
---
Hmm...if it's actually intended and won't get patched out I might need to try it out
---
Yeah it's not explosive but it's yours if you want it I'll be online in a few hours
---
JrArevalo956
---
I am fucking floored! See this shit? This story  and lore writing. beyond the bugs and meme jokes, THIS IS THE STUFF BETHESDA HAS THAT DRAWS ME IN! I love a game that draws me in, engages me in some decent writing and, once I thought Ive heard it all, continues to surprise me! Be honest, it's why you play it too.
---
It is good that your first one is in the Gallaria, which is easy to navigate.  In some of them, even if you are trying to follow teammates, if you don't know the map, one wrong turn can get you hopelessly lost.  And by "you," I mean me.
---
Mutation serums provide upward of 500 caps.
---
And speed demon uses yellowcake flux as an ingredient.  One of the most common easy to get ones.
---
If your doing the water thing you probably quickly end up with more water than you can sell in a day. You should consider selling them on your vendors for like 1 cap each.
---
You'll sell them fast as people will be able to flip them, and make much more than the 1400 daily limit.
---
Could get away by selling them for a bit more I'm sure ,so long as their under the robot prices, but ur wanting fast money.
---
Inert flux sells for 1 cap too. Some peeps prefer flux because its lighter.
---
Okay cool thank a million
---
Don't read too much into this.
---
Teams are fucked up. Too many instances when a player got removed, even though he's still active and on the server, or kicked by the system not the team-leader.
---
Had both cases with my wife... Fun times! :/
---
I always use my emotes to ‚Äúask‚Äù if it‚Äôs okay that I kill them. And if they accept, they just stand there as I shoot until they die. üòÖ
---
But why? Aside from damage perks there is really nothing left worth take in STR.
---
Honestly I would rather increase the amount of punishment I can take.
---
It all comes down to how fast you clean up the leftovers and can nuke down that boss. Psycho is my best friend in these runs two and you got nearly 100% uptime with no perks.
---
Idk they might have a grudge against bloodied characters or something like that.
---
I wish they'd change the interface a bit because if someone crashes or hops it will sometimes say they were removed from the team and everyone else will leave because of it
---
Did you read my first comment? It was a reply to the reply of it.
---
This is an amazing idea.
---
If you put a skin on it, it might be just a visual bug.
---
Recently a skin did something similar for the Grognak Axe, and that one being a much more popular weapon the bug was spotted and reported immediately.
---
I did my first around level 50. It‚Äôs easy really. 
---
There‚Äôs only a few hard enemies in there like 3 dominator assaultrons and one sentry bot. 
---
Keep subtitles on to listen for assaultrons as their random talking will show up if you can‚Äôt hear it. 
---
When you go in make sure the only quest active is the missile launch so you can see where to go. 
---
Bring something to block rads. Preferably power armor or stealth suit.
---
Edit: hack the the turrets to shut them down. 
---
Also you can not kill everything. The bots respawn. Kill the ones in your way and then keep going.
---
Tried sorting when I was in a players vending machine and it did not bring the unknown plans to the top.
---
Dont be a douche because he's right.
---
Do the quest and grind for the excavator suit, then hit up lucky hole mine for lead ore. If you have the Super Duper perk and ammo Smith perk then you will become a bullet factory. It‚Äôs a bit of a grind but then your quality of life will improve ten fold
---
No didn't see that, ffs. I have been getting a lot of comments. I'll reread.
---
No, because it immediately refills your health, you are never downed. Being downed and then revived is a condition for Revenant to trigger.
---
People want pvp, they don't play it because it is completely out of balance and pay2win  (rmt for hacked gear off ebay).
---
That's such a narrow view on features.
---
If I stopped crafting ammo because crafting ammo in bulk is a huge time sink due to a lack of "craft all" option, does that mean I want ammo crafting removed from the game instead of getting a "craft all" option added?
---
Yes max tank killer for sure. I'm also only rocking 1 point in each commando an have zero issues. Also you should be using nerd rage. An be under 20% hp!
---
So much more they could be doing to better tap into that market of peeps who love crafting elaborate structures.
---
Its ultimately what got me to love this game.
---
Friend drug me in kicking and screaming when I thought the game was just a broken first person shooter.  
---
Now I play it more than he does and make elaborate haunted houses.
---
Yeah, that's dumb. Could've swore it use too.
---
Edited to reflect proper reaction in context.
---
The big mine in the southern part of the map with a lot of lead and cultists and a Lovecraftian horror sleeping at the bottom of it.
---
Weight is the main reason I choose STR I have bear arms and strong back I switch back and forth on. But you should definitely get fireproof at 3rd rank it helps a lot
---
I thought I was just new to stealth builds and it didn't show anything, glad I know it's bugged right now.
---
It's well below the Power Fist.
---
They balanced some of this gear around the idea that it would be much easier to roll it, since you can roll for that specific piece.
---
Only use for private world for me is to farm ammo or fusion cores (and less cases resources), only because I don't have to worry about someone stealing the workshop.
---
But I often find the servers I'm on rarely have someone trying to overtake or steal from my workshops. Only used private worlds a few times after getting it, then realizing you can generally do the same farming on public worlds and that's preferable.
---
Could make for an interesting hard mode if they designed it with actual mechanics such as various npcs reacting in various adverse ways.
---
The one day I tried to play rdo was a complete shit show. F all those people.
---
Amazing what can happen in ten minutes. Got legacy, customize skin then decided to drop it. I hope you recorded this so Beth support knew what happened.
---
It's not as profitable.
---
Lol! Not possible.
---
Oh bet your ass I did! I just don‚Äôt know how to use the support system to do a report
---
I have been in OPS that have a 4th inactive player. Usually it is an alt of one of the active players. I don't say no to 15% extra XP or Adrenaline. Most OPS can be done under 8 mins with 2 active players. 3 is better. So if the 4th shares something cool, I'm cool.  
---
If they move to the objectives it is all good. But sitting idle at the entrance and not sharing perks, results in a kick when I'm teamleader.
---
Also, some people will kick out strangers in order to make room for a friend in the public team.
---
That and just a little more building storage too. There are some empty areas of my camp that I‚Äôd like filled.
---
Two in the head to put them out of their misery
---
I get that but then I see they stay at 3 it is kind of strange. But it‚Äôs whatever. Just trying to see if a lot of ppl are having same thing happen. Most time I just make my own team being I need the benefits from herb mentality.
---
Grahm I feel is your best bet. I finally got them to spawn on him and spent all I had to buy them...worth?
---
They really screwed the pooch on this last update.  No reason to get anything nice because anything nice you get only makes the baddies badder.  Wish you had joined before the nerf patch.
---
I think it‚Äôs on their website, you put in your gamer tag and email and narrow down the issue via the menu options. If you can upload the vid to YouTube you can send them the link.
---
Try all the crops around Billings Homestead. I completed it through normal gameplay but if crops count that place probably has enough to finish the whole thing or come very close to it.
---
The game crashes when I alt tab...
---
It's alot easier and less annoying to do per day. At least from my experience.
---
Yea it really sucks you dropped a legacy but the game isn't unplayable without one. I lost like 10 bloodied weapons moving them to my mule but you know what I did? Accepted my mistake and moved on to replace them
---
I don't know why your holding Bethesda's hand
---
All over 1 weapon? Wow...
---
33 I met a guy who gave me a starter pack but I used all that to repair armor and make ammo
---
Nope, Whistle in the Dark is a complete and utter waste of a good skin.
---
Yeah maybe idk. But just trying to see if anyone has had it happen lately. Normally I make my own team so I can get benefits from my mutations. It use to just happen here or there but this week it‚Äôs happened ten times or more that‚Äôs why I asked. Thanks
---
I traded everything for it
---
I'll definitely look into that. Thank you!
---
OP is being a jackass
---
The fact that they don't have ANY Accessibility Setting that I can find is a different issue than that. What does that have to do with anything I posted?
---
Meg is the only thing stopping the crater gang from being just like the blood eagles. She doesn‚Äôt condone killing unless it‚Äôs a final resort. She would much rather swindle and talk things out if she can. You forget her original gang in Appalachia were pacifists and that‚Äôs the background she came from.
---
The problem is, it's Legacy. It's hard enough to get them to roll back for normal items. Trying to reroll  weapon they don't want to exist is kinda a losing battle
---
Thats sucks and shouldn't happen. On the bright side your weapon wasnt good.
---
If you are on Pc, then its your Lucky day
---
What about scrapping Legendaries for modules or a new material. Combine that with your idea for every craftable item as craftable legendaries and I will be very happy.
---
Did you die to something and respawn like that? As that's been the case in the past with this bug. I had something similar where I appeared on fire for a time after dying and respawning.
---
Probably the upgraded super sledge for 2 handed and I personally prefer the knives for their attack speed for 1 handed.
---
It should've been increased already
---
Yea, that was Mike Tyson... he does that somethings. Just be thankful he did not bite your ear off...
---
Wow...how much was everything exactly?
---
Yea
---
There is a recipe for it. Must be rare I have only come across 1 in all the events I have done.
---
I'm on ps4.
---
&gt;Power Patrol TV (plays a little cartoon and the scoreboard theme music on loop as either a commercial or a looped tv series intro)
---
Honestly, this is a good idea for non power patrol stuff as well. A TV that cycles through a feet different generic channels would be great. 
---
They could release a vault tec one that cycles through the SPECIAL commercials or some other company-themed TV's cycling through commercials.
---
Bowie knife only has one skin and it's the "Pioneer Scout Paint".
---
Could that skin cause such issues? I do not know as i don't have any legendary Bowie knifes.
---
i always thought of shopping ppls vendors as more like storage wars
---
I have some points in gladiator to conserve ammo on enemies like molerats and shit. I really dig the chinese officer sword. Get the serrated electrified mod, does more dmg, does bleed damage and does some energy dmg as well.
---
Dunno if its the best but its certainly been treating me right.
---
I traded a bunch of my material all my mid tier weapons and my two be heavys as well as a spec ops mask and my xo1 power armor. I over paid but I really wanted to mix it up .
---
It will get value in Daily ops all the time since each of the enemy types used can spawn with energy weapons
---
Whitespring. So many flowers you can pick
---
Ah so I'm not going crazy. Thank you.
---
Well I'd like to agree with that and know what it is so I can solve it. If this hadn't happened to me several times I would be of the same opinion as you which makes this really irritating.
---
My camp is in a pretty nuke heavy place now that Monongah has an event, so nukes are going off somewhat often. I server hop when one is due, and if I get hit mid-session it's my bad. Thing is, three  times this week I've logged off at my camp and noted that the camp is fine when I log off (via exit to menu), and then have logged on later to a destroyed camp. I'm also not logging off with a few seconds to go until a nuke drop. Also not loading into a nuke zone. And not misremembering any of that.
---
Do you have any ideas in particular or  going by the  logic of 'camp disappears when you log out, so it's impossible', as you seem  certain but other people have reported the same issue and I think there's more to it than this, because between logging off and logging on, my camp has been destroyed. It really is this simple on my end, there aren't any mistakes in my logic I could be reasonably making here
---
&gt;Have you never played any other MMO-ish games?
---
Yes, I have played MMOs extensively, but it's clear you haven't. 
---
&gt;That is pretty standard for them.
---
Yes, but this isn't an MMO, nowhere near close, and mmos use different gearing systems. 
---
The devs can't decide what the game is supposed to be. In mmos, gear being tradeable or not has little to no real impact besides on the economy and gearing alts. *You've no reason to trade it otherwise**. Whereas on 76, you have repairing and modding. The game was heralded as a survival style game, in the fallout universe, and largely played as ( a poorly built) one until wastelanders. 
---
But now with wastelanders, the normal gear you acquire is none tradeable. This impacts the player via repairing and potentially modding. This significantly changes the playstyle of the game. It's clear they're pushing the game more and more towards singleplayer. 
---
If you're one of the builds that is even able to use the new armor and weapons, you can't trade them for repair or modding, the only multiplayer aspect to the game besides a small handful of events, has been removed from and is trending to be removed from all current and forward "content". 
---
So outside of an event like the SBQ or Radiation rumble, we're now just playing a singleplayer game with a...well invested, lobby system: You can't get help gearing, repairing, modding, or questing, they punish diverse build groups in ops (at least the big three, stealth, loud, melee) which are soloable anyway.
---
This isn't just about the gear, but about the development philosophy as a whole. It's also, probably, safe to assume the reason they're doing this, is because they're so laughably inept, that they can't stop people from duping, rather than from a gameplay design standpoint. 
---
Don't even get me started on legacy weapons. Anyway, see the forest, not the trees. 
---
*You don't mod NT gear normally, as that is usually reserved for raid gear in modern mmos, or specific drops that you'd have to go after which again, aren't modded. Gear in MMOs, generally speaking, don't revolve around player skill (think repairing, modding, etc), but rather time sinks in w/e fashion they choose. All my gear is broken from a raid? It costs currency, a resource I have from literally any other task I do, to repair it. I want to swap in a new sloted item? Again, it costs currency, not a skill investment. 
---
Even if it did require a skill investment, I would not have to lose damage, tanking, healing, or support potential in order to repair or slot my equipment. It would be / is a side skill. On 76, if I want to repair things to the same extent as someone else, I have to completely alter my combat build. If I want to *modify gear* I have to do the same as well.
---
Why would it not be as profitable? I'm sure I'm not the only person who would pay for different features. If they have more options it opens up the appeal for more people and would make them more money. Where is your logic coming from?
---
Why I usually try to take into account what would be quickest to implement before tossing out suggestions. 
---
Would a new ghoul player class be deeply appreciated? Surely! Can they do that anytime soon given what their already behind on fixing? Never.
---
Just a cosmetic skin texture would satisfy many, but there are mechanics they would need to be more friendly. 
---
Might be quicker if they implemented some of the more interesting skin textures already being used.
---
I recall having come across bugged out NPCs before that were static and unclothed. 
---
They built in a ton of detail for some of these models for them to only ever be covered up.

I do think that they really should do more to capture the imagination of roleplayers and tap into that market too.
---
I keep saying this but... man are these devs leaving money on the table.
---
This is how I did it use the perk to double what you pick up. It takes 5mins tops.
---
Okay I'll let the team know
---
You should read patch notes....they changed how damage is calculated.
---
What sort of help specifically are you looking for?
---
That was me! I took all of your halloween candy!!!! WHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
On an unrelated note, my tooth is starting to hurt... anyone know a good dentist?
---
I'll add you as a friend. Give me a yell if I can help. I keep hearing the game is tough at lower levels now, so you if need a weap or something, do hit me up.
---
Never said it wasn't, but good job champ.
---
Mire. Road by Haven Church. Tons of glowing fungus.
---
Omg yes, the vault tec one would be dope. Maybe we can get a power patrol one for free, then have the chance to buy the vault tec one in atom shop.
---
Doing it in the forest is the easiest. 
---
I ran up and down the river by flatwoods and collected tons of blood leaf and soot flowers to craft some healing salves. Figured if im picking flowers might as well get something out of it.
---
Both soot flower and blood leaf are easy to spot from a distance.
---
Stash space  should be at least a 1000
---
I just started the excavator suit quest and then abandoned it.  The assultron down there kills me in about 3 seconds.
---
my top notch brain
---
The only time I have ever free ride a daily ops was during the Burning Mines and the public Daily Ops team I joined was almost done with the Daily Ops.  By the time I got to the rest of the team, the Daily Ops was done.
---
As far as reviving a downed mate or shooting a single bullet, it only matters if they are not close to the signal boosters.  If someone wants to hide behind machinery or take a dirt nap by the signal boosters, then I don't care.  All that matters is their presence for that portion of the Daily Ops.
---
Equip green thumb, go to The Generals Steakhouse. Farm in back, up and down a few rows and finish with the carrots and done.
---
Big Bend Tunnel is full of brain fungus and glowing fungus.
---
It's random if he has them or not so check every bbq on different servers. Other rare ones are the radiation emitters and mirror ball among others.check every time if he is carrying them for sale.
---
Couple of questions
---
1) What‚Äôs you‚Äôre build so far? People here can help tweak that
---
2) Are you PC or Console? Lots of folks here can help in game; myself included. 
---
3) what‚Äôs your current weapon &amp; armor?
---
üßêkilling with intellect i see
---
You said the game being FPS is questionable. It's been a FPS for the past 12 years
---
I went to the meditation temple and circled it picking all the crops. Finished that one in five minutes.
---
To their minds, they know some of the services are more desirable than others. They justify the price point by the number of services /perks in the bundle.
---
Think of the chicken at Costco. It's bait (along with a few other choice items).... To lure you into the store to buy other shit your don't really want /need
---
Bloodied Faster Fire Guass Minigun thats sitting on my display rack since I am a max Health build
---
I don't mind because sometimes people are selling rare plans that I already know. But I'm sure I'm in the minority.
---
I have yet todo my 1st. I‚Äôm currently level 127...
---
If guided meditation pops up, you can run around the Palace of the winding path and get all 50, most are near the bridge point for the event.
---
So what did they ‚Äòmake untradeable‚Äô?  The new gold bullion items?
---
I dont really have anything super great.
---
I'm using an anti-limb anti-robot 2 star automatic handmade. I really dig it, chewed through todays daily op.
---
Its great against ghouls too, just shoot the legs and they never get near me cus it cripples them so fast.
---
BE25 Railway Rifle. Not a ‚Äúmagic weapon‚Äù, but it may as well be with how much damage it deals. And never ending vats too.
---
Unmodded, non-legendary Rolling Pin.
---
Literally pancakes everything it sees. You can even hear the enemies screaming 'oh crepe!'
---
A vulture. It was the original model for the scorchbeast before it was changed to a bat.
---
Submit a ticket regarding the issue. Request a reimbursement of Atoms. They are usually pretty good about that unless you abuse the system.
---
rotted out scorchbeast
---
Mole rats with mines attached is my limit please.
---
Add me. Andreslamantis. I'll get you to elder whenever I am playing. Just be sure to stay near the beacon.
---
I need to try this combo with solar armor
---
as long as they can fix the those problems with out nerfing the guns. that is what i hear the most basically " i dont have one so they should be nerfed ! " 
---
i keep saying we should have an option in settings to turn goo/ ash piles OFF
---
Ummm I really didn‚Äôt think of a build on this one. I‚Äôm on ps. I‚Äôm using a legendary 10mm smg and an auto handmade
---
I think that‚Äôs a SB in its original form.
---
vampires firerate 50drwa 10mm smg. With Suppressor rank three, dodgy and its high ROF i can't die. Vanguard armor too
---
As long as you are using a mic to communicate that you are starting a daily op, I agree....
---
Yep it‚Äôs kinda hard to get them to do a rollback, which they only do on very special cases (such as hack victims)
---
JE/15crit Ultracite Laser...my baby üë∂
---
Big bend tunnel with that green thumb perk card equipped.  Also good for mole miner challenges
---
I'm just not an angry ignorant tool who thinks cus WoW did something, 76 should be able to too. They're completely different.
---
But he's the typical angry gamer boy who just wants to yell and insult devs. It's toxic and its why devs never want to talk to fans.
---
And the stash is linked to stability it was the cause of alot of launch issues. But ya know, dont let facts get in the way of being angry on the internet.
---
Depends on the build, but my heavy gunner‚Äôs BE Flamer wrecks everything. Thank Todd for repair kits though. Commando - B2525 Fixer. Junkie commando it‚Äôs a JE25 combat rifle.
---
So why would they not add a bundle with OTHER desirable features. It's not like it's going to lose them money.
---
I don't know what a costco is. Is that some american thing?
---
At early lvls I would avoid automatic weapons. Once you are higher and have the perks and resources to make thousands of ammo easily automatic weapons will become viable
---
Upvote for the terrible puns
---
And... hoard screws, springs and aluminium, you‚Äôre going to need loads
---
Generals steakhouse (right beside robco) has a garden out back with around 30-40 plants. With the green thumb perk on i completed the challenge with one visit.
---
Edit: this is also where i go for my food and drink every time. Theres corn and carrots for soup, and tatos for juice. Theres also melons or something there too. Plus a dirty water stream right beside the garden, and a stove inside the steakhouse if you dont have a fallout first tent to put down.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
Boo. Upvote for truth.
---
when i was selling things to get my 1.5 limit each day. i was running the top of the world area, the outside. would be dragging ass getting back to the train station but i would hit my 1.5 in 1 run. the trick is to loot everything you can put on that perk to sell for more and sell everything you can 
---
the real $ (caps) is made with your vendor thats my end game
---
I didn‚Äôt make it. I asked my friend for a handmade, he has all the mods for it and assumed I wanted auto.
---
Did the prime meat event in ash heap 
---
Turned the crickets, rats, and scorpions into ash
---
With my tesla. Killed the sheepsquatch with my .50 cal
---
Yes. It's a very American thing. It's the only American thing. And you're fortunate to know nothing about it.
---
Could your username be offensive to your fellow players? I haven't kicked anyone yet, and I hardly take notice of my teammates' names, but I see (mostly mildly) offensive player names on the map all the time, and if you're called TRUMPTRUMPTRUMP, BIDEN2020HARRIS, or xXxBIGdicksRULExXx, expect trouble. ;-)
---
No food/drink (or no penalties, at least) is still coming, but in the winter update.
---
Try a vampire gun
---
People would check my stash and go crazy. Bloodied Explosive Fixer would win, but if you ask me, I have to choose my vampire faster fire Tesla.
---
No politics while gaming should be an unspoken rule.
---
What does that have to do with saving ammo using a melee weapon? Was just trying to be helpful.
---
i think he was more complaining about going to someones camp excited they had X # of guns for sale only to find they are all crap and way to over priced
---
Nah lol my gt is kingsites12 so unless someone doesn‚Äôt like kings and my last name then idk or maybe they don‚Äôt like number 12. Lol but I know what you mean. I‚Äôve seen some messed up ones
---
Lol üòÇ
---
I haven't played this game in forever, so I may be missing a few things.
---
remove all the limits, they do nothing to help this game, cap , scrip, gold, how much you can sell each day, earn each day, keep.   
---
 get rid of all those limits
---
Considering you have no real storage containers to carry them in, it's probably bugs or something have crawled into/onto them.
---
He is telling you that using melee backups in the forreat to save ammo doesn't work anymore.  They made the game level with you.
---
Eh, if they do that then they‚Äôll hopefully add an option to turn on/off the ui portion for it. But I‚Äôll be keeping my person fed and watered. Too many buffs you miss out on.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs Sheepsquatch Club, War Glaive, Power Fist
---
Irony is dead and that scum bag murdered it. No reason to encourage him
---
You know what would make a good scorchbeast? The bald eagle!
---
Ghoul slayers suppressed pump action with ffr and 250 damage resist as primary. Quad suppressed auto handmade with damage resist while aiming and bash damage secondary
---
Well yeah, they made it level with you. But so what? I've been bashing my way through enemies with melee all the same. Not high level assignments or stuff like that, just general adventuring.
---
Have a Hater edition Collectron that says 'worst game ever, Bethesda killed Fallout, I'm cancelling my FO1st, I'm uninstalling the game'.
---
And have it programmed to do exactly that!
---
Got mine at watoga super duper mart or whatever it's called
---
probably the fact that your asking alot for a game that crashes when someone simply trys to alt tab
---
if i figure anything out that can help you i will post here, or dm you sorry
---
edit: 
---
You can disable Motion Blur by editing this already existing line in ‚ÄúFallout76Prefs.ini‚Äù to equal 0.
---
The location of .ini file: (C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/Fallout76Prefs.ini)
---
 **Note:** You might need to change ‚ÄúFallout76Prefs.ini‚Äù to read only to prevent this from resetting, it may still reset however‚Ä¶
