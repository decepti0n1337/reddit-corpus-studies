---
Twice so far for me. Both times as the fire is being lit.
---
The harlequin? I haven't seen information to the contrary. Only time will tell, or someone blowing up this sub about it lol
---

---
Maybe
---
As a female the most accurate realism is how difficult it is to find bobby pins. 
---
Bought it from some dude I met on the trade subreddit because I couldn't find it and it was frustrating me 
---
Ah I gotcha lol
---
You can boost your LCK using booze and the Happy-Go-Lucky CHR perk.
---
Why do you want 17 luck though? Is that some kind of break point for something that I don't know about?
---
A legendary drill would actually be pretty cool.   
---
Call it the 'Black Decker'. 
---
One of the corpses is in an outhouse at Pricketts Fort
---
It would suck if it did. The x-01 jetpack is super rare, but YouTubers have said that luck doesn't make a difference. I hope that applies here too.
---
Just dis the event with a large group.   We lost 1 robot to the suicide bombers and killed the giant sloth.     However the event was failed.    Not sure why.  Did not get a mask.   
---
If lots of flux means yellowcake I'm in :p
---
It's he always there or another random encounter
---
41, so not far behind ya. 
---
You can find it in some of the moonshine shacks, farms, and cafeterias. Don't recall which ones though.
---
Hello, I have this exact same issue I’m just racking my comment here so I get notified when new info arrives.
---
I’ve seen it around Helvetia. 
---
Love this post. The group I play with all met on 76 and we range in age from 13 to 40ish. It's nice how this game has brought people and various generations together for some post-apocalyptic fun.
---
&gt; holsters clipped onto our belts
---
Next to the onion?
---
Don't think so I've got 7 in luck and I've got 7-Witches
---
&amp; 4-Owls 
---
Afraid its random, gotta pop over there to the event every hour or so though. 
---
I just do a server hop every hour.
---
Ah, I haven't seen any like that
---
I somehow already have you added, can you join me
---
It could be in reference to the pose pack
---
From the Wiki.   I don't think the Man mask is from the event, so 10 masks..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
* Fasnacht Death Skull mask
---
* Fasnacht Devil mask
---
* [Fasnacht Giant mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fasnacht_Giant_mask)
---
* Fasnacht Harlequin mask
---
* [Fasnacht Man mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fasnacht_Man_mask)
---
* Fasnacht Merman mask
---
* Fasnacht Napoleon mask
---
* Fasnacht Owl mask
---
* Fasnacht Second Man mask
---
* Fasnacht Witch mask

---
Imagine not being able to destroy a whitesprings turret vase or an annoying siren base!
---
Ibbugsy, what platform do you play on?   If you are on PC, look up Kraag.  I’m a young 47, but would love to join you in stomping around Appalachia!
---
39 here. You won't get "sup brah" from me, but every other word outta my mouth is "dude" "fuck" or "bro" lol
---
Thats fine. Just glad I have a second confirmed location to look for him
---
I've had this happen to me since the beta.
---
I had a rather lovely home built until the nukashine update. Now I have a brewer, fermenter, a stash, corn and razorgrain.
---
I play nightly with a guy who is 59, there are a lot more older players out there playing this game than I think people realize.
---
There is no way in hell the rarity of masks rewarded is based on contributions, no event in the game acts like that. Bethesda would have to go out of their way to implement a system that would serve only to screw over anyone not blasting everything that moves with an explosive shotgun. Random rewards are random. 
---
No need to get testy.  I'm sure he's having a legit problem.  Fallout seems to have issues when you get folks joining from different geo's on  to the same server.  I notice this for example when I play with this dude from Poland and I'm in the US (things get very laggy, loot spinning wheels, long terminal access times etc).  I'd be dollars to donuts that whats is going on here, especially with very popular events like this that have folks server hopping and joining friends servers.
---
and multiple active markers!! its 2019 for atoms sake
---
Yeah it’s because this is the subreddit for the game. We are a small percentage of the player base, and an even smaller percentage of that plays the game in this hardcore loot/leveling focus. 
---
i can sell  **ultracite recipes** ( mods plans p.a) for 1k a pop if u want em i don't have all but i do think i have like 10 diffrent
---
There are definitely more than five. 
---
Baker
---
Beekeeper
---
Musician
---
Butcher
---
Woodsman
---
Chandler
---
Historian
---
Others?
---
You found The Interloper. Oxhorn has a pretty good video about it. 
---
Did you want any more while you're here?
---
Oh.... one moment
---
Helvetia is the wave right now
---
Did you at least get stronger enemies with better loot?
---
Great. I’m right about to start all that. Guess I’ll side quest for awhile.
---
i keep getting giant masks, i really want the death skull mask
---
I joined one parade and didnt get any rewards.
---
Check and get back to me. 
---
i usually server hop til i get one may take maybe 3 hops
---
Love this post. As a 51yr old, I'm having fun playing another Fallout game. Only concern I have is when I'm random noob helping, and I speak to them, only to hear the click of the mic and get some 12 yr old ask for help with a 'major bunch of hard enemies' over by their camp, only to find it's some level 15 supermutants and feral ghouls.  Too many nights of DoomII and Quake have left their mark, and there are still days where I hear a sound and go 'Guard dog, possibly an enforcer' in my head, before walking past a friendly doberman sitting by the gate of their home. But at least I've stopped walking into buildings and worked out the best place to grapple to for a game of CTF.
---
Why are certain masks such as the Jester impossible to get.Could be even bugged but who knows.Have been farming for 6 hours and not seen a single person have it.The duplicates of masks and the event itself is a [joke.So](https://joke.So) boring and slow.Doing this event should reward a new mask each time,instead of doing this 50+ times.10 runs of this event for each mask is enough of a commitment.
---
What’s your PSN?
---
Does that mean they become legendary and are actually worth killing for more than revenge?
---
ericrpowell
---
[removed]
---
What platform are you on? 
---
I'm not doubting you. My experience (so this is anecdotal evidence) has been great. I've been on the same server and have done the event 3 times so far with no issues at all.
---
I've finished the event twice and both times I was kicked from the server just as the event was flagging complete.........
---
Time wasted. 
---
As tedious as it sounds, the best method is to go to the town, and just hang out talking to the robot every few minutes. It's suppoused to be available an hour after it was last triggered, but somebody still has to trigger it.

It’s only been out 5 or 6 times tho?
---
PC, could be just PC servers
---
Xbox1 I did it 4 times in 3 hours without changing servers and it functioned flawlessly. 
---
How much?
---
Fallout 76.... So bad it  actually became good somehow? 
---
That’s exactly right 
---
You get it from the parade. I just got it lol
---
Don’t mean to be that guy, but the map is incomplete and some resource spots on the map, don’t actually exist in-game. 
---
10 masks, 1 beret, 13 blueprints and 2 recipes.
---
sorry, don't know what was up with the ptt - I could hear you just fine.
---
Can I also get 2x of the grounded and Speed Demon serums as well?
---
Where about a in the settings? Didn’t realise this was possible on Xbox 
---
I wish we could use those masks with PA. \*sigh\*
---
I would hope so lol damn man 
---
2 each?
---
Nope have been farming for six hours and just want the Harlequin.I thought the mask the Robost are wearing me relate to the quest reward but I have seen the Harlequin multiples times on a Robot.Could be bugged.
---
😳
---
YES!! But Fuck those guys with 1-shot builds.
---
All rng
---
Mountainside bed and breakfast packs a punch for such a small place tons of stuff there 
---
That's kind of awesome. 
---
Havent seen anyone wearing them either
---
 I think the bundle would be considered the discount. Even if you have half of them I think you're still getting 3 for the price of 2. I could be wrong, I was still pretty tired before I headed off to work 
---
No issues on PS4 so far.
---
Depends, how do you feel about single star legendary junkies lead pipes? 
---
I wish we can fight this in the future.
---
You need to sell tickets for this
---
i think someone estimated 4-500m
---
im between arkos and gauley mine, i can hit helevetia, but not "back on the beat" responder building
---
I haven’t seen the devil and monster ones either XD
---
Like the masks are a fun reward (im trying to get them all) and the legendary mega sloth that always spawns at the end is nice but adding some stronger radtoads or something with legendary drops would actually make me WANT to nuke the place first lol
---
34 checking in, grew up on Fallout 1 &amp; 2. Fallout  3 was a huge shock and here we are, multiplayer!
---
Can you nuke that area? I've only had people launch in Cranberry Bog and at Whitesprings... I have yet to launch one myself.
---
I like to bulk my materials to keep track of them easily, don't know why, and then when i want i can sell excess bulks to vendors.
---
Ok, thanks
---
yep I even go to trade high level players but always the same inventory.
---
For a minute I thought this was a NSFW
---
Anyone have a perk build for this type of a armor build?
---
I've done the event twice, and i've looted the corpse fine.
---
Xb1, 1 out of 3 times worked great. Then textures stopped loading all the way. players were invisible even though I could see bullets, explosions, and their dots on the map.. then enemies became invisible the 3rd time, killing 2 bots while I shot in random directions. Decided to finish my biv quest (textures still weird), since I had the fermented drink in my inventory, entered to tattoo parlor, and was met with an endless loading screen. Reset Xbox and router, tried to load in 8 times and can't play anymore. Hit play, and get an endless loading screen(let sit 10 mins). Screwed for 2.5 hours so far
---
Forget in game I want this in real life! 
---
I have seen someone with the  **Fasnacht Man mask** .Anyone else?
---
Got a handful of serum recipes. 1500 each or 1250 each if you buy at least 4
---
It should just be Ezmar, fairly certain
---
I’ve been playing with my son since release, I’m 60 he’s 34. I hope the dumb things I do when we play make him smile when I’m gone....no behind you the mutant is BEHIND you.
---
Hmmm...ok. That sounds reasonable. Also, where did you get the plans for it?
---
Surprisingly real world DMV does have radiated zombies that attack often, they are called crackheads tho.
---
Is it’s because too many bots survive and there’s different tables for how many go down
---
Well the event bugs out though so... :)
---
I wonder if some of them will be limited time atom shop items this week like the mask in the shop now.
---
I go through a routine that starts with hitting the vendors in Watoga and checking for legendary robots. This usually means selling bulked excess from my stash. From there I pick an event, complete it, and start walking. I'll go on what I call "junk runs" and pillage whatever the closest few locations are, usually making a line. I take the time to look for any cool scenes Fallout games are known for. If I'm not doing that or focusing on any nuke zones, I've been trying my hand at stealing workshops and studying how inventive people are getting since PvP has balanced more.  
---
I wind up saving caps for the big ticket items I'm still so far from purchasing, even at level 143.  
---
nm i jus realized it went off sale today facepalm
---
Does the event notification only show if you are in Helvetia? Or will it appear as long as you are in the server?
---
i got my set from the paladins bedroom at the end of the BoS questline, i think phenix in watoga may also sell it. (i have not been there in a bit)
---
Go to helvetica 
---
Done it 3 times now, and got 3 toothy man masks :/
---
Happens every hour after it was completed. 
---
old man winter does drop someone was wearing it 
---
If you don't have gunsmith rank 5 then it probably still won't last that long. I used about 4 plasma cores since the last patch, just got the gun down to 100% so that's 1000+ rounds. Gatling plamsa is now a very viable option
---
At 64 I have played almost every Fallout there is. One of the best series of games out there. A bit disappointed with some things in 76 but it's still a good game. Maybe Bethesda will fix some more problems. The availability of mods made F3 and NV great. Hope Bethesda realizes that's still true.
---
I’m almost certain it’s just giant, witch, owl, toothy, and soldier dropping. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
They need to add a curl up in a ball or rocking back and forth on the ground mumbling emote..
---
I haven't seen this sloth yet... Does it come with the wave of wolves? 
---
doubt they would since they  just slowed down the fire rate in the last patch.
---
I remember being in ps4 party with non Americans doing that quest, the rage was epic
---
doubt it, everything that on the store doesn't drop
---
31 here, on PC under Punderground, I love meeting new people and going on crazy mini gun adventures.
---
Did it drop a drill by chance? Drills are in the legendary pool for some ridiculous reason
---
Ps4? I have an extra
---
My server has everyone trying to hit each other
---
ah ok ..where is helvetica? 
---
You can launch pretty much anywhere on the map, iirc you can't nuke vault 76 though 
---
You sure you tagged it? I did it 5 times and got a legendary every time except for the one time people killed it before it even got out of the tree. That being said I’m sure it’s possible, it happens in white springs all other time (not getting a legendary)
---
Right of vault 76 next to the river
---
Youd think the nicer looking masks would be when all of them survive but it's possible. 
---
The "Old Man Summer" Mask cannot be found in-game.
---
But it IS a Red recolor of the Blue "Old Man Winter" Mask you can get from the Event, VERY rarely.
---
More than likely right. Just wanted to double check.
---
Old man winter is a Atom Shop item
---
To the right of flattwoods
---
oh thank you
---
To the right of flatwoods
---
Thanks!!! So just to clarify the winter mask is a rare drop? I’m going into this seasonal event a little blind.
---
1250caps for marsup
---
I mean they did say some are super rare so drop rate could be like 1/100.
---
Man that sucks. You wrote quite an essay and all you had to do was use search. 
---
No worries 
---
THIS is interesting, because Win had that update to fix the lag as "failed".  Just reinstalled it...wonder if it'll fix the massive hangs I've been suffering...
---
Dang. Where does the BoS questline even begin? Lol. And I have been in Watoga a lot recently and haven't seen it :/
---
try restarting
---
i guess it comes to 42.60 w tax of course..... facepalm
---
I let two die as they were bugged stuck.Made no difference.Very hard for any to die with all the high geared players around though.
---
That really doesn't make sense from game design because rifles and melee weapons massively out DPS heavy weapons.
---
Whaaat? That’s a valid strategy! It’s not greifing it Bethesda allows it in game! You just need to learn the wasteland is harsh and shit. 
---
/S
---
Don’t get discouraged, you can always trade extras. 
---
Maybe you stanky
---
Take a shower
---
What’s your psn? Mine is fireking51105
---
Happened to me too. Just playing new event. Got infinite load. When i relog in, this authorized message shows
---
Likewise!! My PSN friends range from middle school to mild senility =D
---
Make a shower first tho
---
It's perfect. Might be my favorite Fallout side mission. Seriously. 👍 Really is a grind, but in a funny way.
---
That was fun. I haven’t done that quest since I got the game but I don’t remember random scorchbeast getting involved. Lol. 
---
Enjoy your All Rise!
---
Ok
---
This doesn't scream scam at all. Reported
---
49 here. 
---
Please! Im sick of getting dumped in the river when I fast travel! 
---
I hate it how the squirrels don’t spawn very frequently ever so often, failed 2 parades because we couldn’t find squirrels
---
One time out of like 6 of the times I was able to loot it I didn’t receive a legendary. 
---
I know this is totally off topic, but lightly related. Am I the only one that thinks the Glowing Wendigo spawn in WS golf club is too underwhelming? He’s packed full of pointless loot, never has legendary items, and is perpetually level 43. For such musical fanfare that announces his entrance, he’s dead before the second baritone. 
---
Napoleon is the soldier mask I believe. 
---
Yep got it on my 8 or 9th try
---
Well the Robots are wearing some of the rare ones I have never seen players have and they are in the advertisements for this event so I doubt they would be in the atom shop
---
That was old man summer. Is winter dropping there too? 
---
I enjoyed seeing almost the entire server doing it but ya anticlimactic 
---
Some items can be sold loose, this really killing the need to bulk. Such items include Fiberglass, crystal shards, and I believe waste antiseptic. 
---
Yep and theirs level 200 hundred plus  doing this shit lol
---
I agree. I am 49 and played the original fallout game. I love this game. 
---
Yeah, I from what I see it may just be the Moon and the Summer that are shop items.
---
I was able to stab his lifeless body until he exploded into parts, which were lootable.
---
Same here 
---
its not. i dont know how else to ask.
---
I heard old man winter was a rare drop
---
That’s the line up I’m thinking plus the beret. I haven’t even seen another.
---
I've done it couple times. Wasnt a bad event but it is only a weekly event 
---
Are you saying you got extra plans deleted or plans you already knew got deleted? Also, where did you learn the confederate hat plans?
---
Is there a chance your mixing up old man summer with old man winter?
---
Pretty much.
---
We need the legendary vendor already!  inject some freaking life into this game!
---
nope it was blue unlike the red one
---
Can you clarify because the Grafton workshop and Grafton station are nowhere near each other
---
yea right at the end.  It was level 38 in my game, im a 105.  So it's useless really.
---
That’s what I was starting to think that XD I could practically afk and still complete these.
---
Since the very beginning, when server disconnects were truly a part of life when playing, I was constantly impressed with the auto save that the game has. 
---
Coming from GTA, which is obviously a massive game, the server disconnects would often revert you to 5-10 MINUTES before the disconnect. This was used as a very common exploit for Players to buy a service, use the service, then close the game. The money would be refunded to their account as the game resumes from 5-10 min earlier. 
---
Whereas in FO76, everything seems to be in place even with hard disconnects. 
---
Is that just what you got? Or is that literally the only thing they drop? Because that would be kind of hilarious 
---
Go to,  go fund me dude.
---
In fallout 4 you join the raiders ,you take over settlements you helped build,and you finally get to subjugate all those sniveling whining little peons who needed a mommy to coddle them in every step of their journey into the apocalyptic aftermath of a society that didn't give a fuk about their feelings.i play a raider because it is my nature to do so.this game gives us the option to replace the npcs which are so sorely missed.sorry not sorry if I kill you,survival of the fittest is the law in a concrete jungle baby.
---
And a habit 😂
---
because the files have been there since the beta but not used in-game yet.
---
They should fix it. 20 people fighting level 5 enemies isn't very fun. At least if it still worked after being nuked it might be kind of a challenge.
---
decom shower is a shower.
---
i mean if gifting is possible maybe i shoulda asked for that n then payback when i get paid? would that have sounded better?
---
I get this is a gaming sub and not a life advice sub, but if you don’t have $40 in your bank account, you shouldn’t be buying anything non-essential until you have built up a solid financial cushion. 
---
Here is the worst part,  if you leave before completing it... you lose all progress. 
---
Learned plans were deleted from my memory.
---
Found hat plans on random spawns
---
ok sorry guys, ill take down the post
---
What do you mean weekly event? I hadn't heard that.
---
Played it once. Sadly could not loot the sloth :(
---
 Congrats! I did my first a few days ago. What level are you? I was Level 178. Taught an old dog new tricks. ;)
---
? Are you still launching it
---
Are you on right now? I’ll be on for probably another 45 minutes
---
There is no such thing as "excess plastic." 
---
Just got online. Gt banshee3
---
Use Pacifist in settings. 
---
Alright cool!
---
Gunsmith is 5
---
55 this year 
---
old enough to remember pong
---
and I think I have a  copy of fallout version one somewhere 
---
Not weekly,  I've done it 4 times already. 
---
Yeah happy-go-lucky was my original go to idea but I really don't want to run more than my 4 points in charisma for lone wanderer. Also the 17 luck is a benchmark for being able to crit every third hit in vats. Pretty important during the queen raid. You can also go 33 luck with unyielding armor for some crazy crit action, but I want to run power armor so that's out of the mix.
---
Wouldn't stop people from harming you
---
He already smells like R. Kelly’s sheets.
---
no it was dropped to 20%
---
&gt;Personal attacks are a policy violation
---
Fuck the police
---
Not weekly,  I've done it 4 times already. Or did you mean week long? 
---
It only lasts a week, then it's gone. Think of it like a holiday event.
---
They cant really do enough damage to matter though 
---
Interesting, thanks for letting me know
---
Thanks I'll have to look into the cooking stuff
---
This was the original skin used as seen in the posters by garrahan. I think we might see something like what you described when they start making new skins for it 
---
I hope so. It keeps spawning me the opposite end of where my door is
---
Are you sure you're not confusing "Long Bow Bar" with "Bow Bar"?
---
On the second go around, yes. I remember being merciful the first time. Or I saved it and did both. I cant remember exactly. 
---
Bow Bar right? Not Long Bow Bar?
---
I didnt remember if I had used it or not. So I went shopping and found it at a vendor. It says known. This isn’t the 1st time I’ve shopped for it. I really don’t want to buy another copy just to see if I can read it. 
---
Every time I think of making a few to get some mods I realize I can’t craft it. I fast travel to a vendor, look for the mod in the plan section, can’t find it and scroll up and there it is, (Known)Plan: Lever Action. 
---
That's neither a correct statement of what was wrong with those quests, nor is it relevant today, since they were fixed a long time ago.
---
Thank you.   I never have time to compare different sets so these posts help more than you know
---
Same
---
Not according to the OP. O guess if enough people do slap damage you can still die pretty quick. 
---
Dang, I thought I was an old-timer, having just turned 40.  Guess I can't blame my lack of coordination on middle-age anymore... I just lack coordination period.  Nice to see the old-school gamers representing, though.
---
I’ll sell you one dude, what you wanna pay for it?
---
I got disconnected 3 times while doing the DMV quest. My progress kept restarting. I had to do that quest 3 damn times. 
---
No you don't, they fixed that quest.
---
My wife would have me believe the same. She thinks I'm too old to play video games....I'm 33
---
Lol Bethesda probably spent more time on this than the rest of the game...jk
---
Yawn
---
33 here and I've been trying to cut back on swearing online. I'm down to an occasional "Ah hell. Got disconnected again."
---
These hats are very profitable, selling around 20 caps per hat at vendors. Best part is they only cost 1 cloth.
---
I'm 35 and I can't organize my thumbs well enough to quickly use the emote wheel either, so don't feel bad.
---
Seriously I had let my razorgrain go by the wayside until I realized I need it for brewing and let me tell you what an amazing gardener I am now. Top effin’ notch. 
---
Hmmm. Maybe I'm just on the same servers all the time with the same people. 
---
I did that and then the game glitched and I had to do it twice. :(
---
yo just a question, have you been server hopping forbthe event for a lot of times?
---
Except for your level, you sound about like my dad playing. He's about your age and just recently started.
---
I was on pacifict. the pvp is still broken
---
A video of what.... me not crafting something?
---
I’m level 105, gunsmith is level 5 (that’s the most), I have every material, I have all appropriate cards equipped, weapon bench, craft, machined guns, nothing. 
---
need a bedtime story kid?
---
I got the sausage recipe 
---
105, gunsmith 5
---
The recommended sets at the bottom are wrong if I'm reading it right. Says best set for all 3 but has 0 RR.
---
yea for real, open the map, move cursor over just enough to get out of the icon's zone and click. this makes a ton of sense
---
I'm ya man if you are on PS4?
---
That doesn’t work. 
---
Try this...unequip the card and then re equip it and try again
---
Floor decor I thought.. it’s basically the bon fire statue.
---
If no one has done this for you, I’ll do it. Psn: JJMRock 
---
Helmet?
---
I meant the plastic really has limited uses besides for bulking and weapons. I dont know about you but my stash is full of plastic that I dont have much use for other than selling and bulking
---
Me. Got the 4:8:2000 while doing the new event
---
It would be wise to have some knowledge about the topic, before giving suggestions. 
---
Yes, heavy weapons do need buff still, but the problem is deeper. The devs know where the problem lies, but looks like they not tested much the new values.
---
Yeah I should have worded that differently 
---
I got a spare giant mask from 2 parades
---
The enemies are like level 5, it's super hard not to one shot everything.
---
It seemed like you only got the like mixed cocktails from it. However I just got the cranberry moonshine recipe from it. So who knows lol.
---
Fag
---
Not the Sloth though. And i had 2 times one guy with 1shot build 1 shotting it, i doubt everyone else had the time to tag it.
---
Idsmashthat336 add me if you want to trade 
---
It sells for 10-15+
---
You, sir, will be among America's finest to rebuild.
---
I was only to get 4 people to take a photo. Guess I’ll try tomorrow 
---
Yep. Same code. I put a ticket in. I’ll let ya know if I get a reply. 
---
::puke emote::
---
Probably the best fallout content I've ever completed. Was a master peice. Nailed Co op perfectly with a real callback to the classic fallout games. 
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
I've only ever seen/gotten: toothy, witch, owl, soldier, giant
---
What builds aren't a one shot build on a level 35 mob lol
---
No. I got the error my first try logging in today. 
---
As a casual, this was pretty underwhelming. All the high levels completing events and killing mobs with TSE in 1-2 hits. The event really doesn't scale well at all. I got participation credit but it felt like, what's the point if can't even really participate because everyone else does/kills so fast?
---
The Sloth spawned 63lvl.
---
yea. Same. I also put a ticket. I am kind of pissed because i just bought the 4000 atoms package.
---
Actually it was fucking perfect you fascist. Stop bullying Bethesda right now or were gonna have problems here, buddy 
---
Your title is misleading. I have the Confederate soldier cap and it sells for 14 caps for me. Not as high as top hat but still incredibly useful.
---
Same here. I just want the jester, mole miner looking one, and old man winter. 
---
I’m 42 with twin 15 year old teenagers that play Overwatch on PS4 and Nintendo Switch games. I am the only one that plays Xbox. I only got an Xbox so I could play Fallout 4 with mods that didn’t require the use of “in game assets”’like on PS4. 
---
I agree wholeheartedly with your post and sentiment. Also love that you refer to dinner as “supper”. 
---
I was Level 168 when I launched my first nuke. Hell, I didn’t even join the enclave until Level 168. I still haven’t discovered about 1/4 of the map. Maybe 1/3. 
---
I didn’t become a fallout junkie until Fallout 4, which I played incessantly. And I do love Fallout 76, though it is certainly a different game than FO4. Like many have said, FO76 is definitely NOT Fallout 5. 
---
It makes sense that there are quite a few “older@ players lurking in the servers and here on Reddit. This is a rather mature group of people and the juvenile griefing are exceptions versus the norm or majority. FO76 is, for lack of a better expression, a “kinder, gentler, Online multiplayer game” for the most part. Like Todd Howard said, it’s “softcore survival”. 
---
Speaking of Todd Howard, when the hell are we going to hear from that old guy? It seems like he’s been suspiciously silent since launch. 
---
Anyway, thanks for posting. And good luck in the game. We all need it. :)
---
Dam, I hope this isn't on purpose, took me forever to get the witch outfit.
---
The two INCREDIBLY rare masks are "Old Man Winter" and "Harlequin."
---
I haven't gotten either or even seen a player with either.
---
"Old Man Summer" is exclusive to Old Man Winter, but Red instead of Blue. There was a second Atom Store Fasnacht Mask datamined that looks like a Moon with a Rocket in it's Eye.
---
Damn that’s a bummer man
---
Me too... Doesn't help that I'm trying to kill 'em
---
in abbys bunker in the NE corner of the mire, on abbys  terminal iirc, not sure which entry it is to start though.  eventually the main questline takes you through it
---
Your Luck stat does not influence legendary/event drops in any way.
---
They should have made it a grinder so it helps with grinding for gear.
---
Griefing will still occur on PvE servers when separate PvP servers are created.  In fact, it will be worse on PvE servers.
---
I’m at your camp right now, could you get the knight sergeant paint on my T60?
---
And it’s 1 cloth to craft?
---
I have problems with my hands and tiny letters to tap. But of course ur one of privileged assholes giving everything to them ya mama,s boy. And u cared enough to read. What a dumbass
---
Well you know whoever gets them will make a stupid amount of caps on the trading sub
---
Yeah
---
830PST, CT, or East Coast?
---
45 myself and playing with my son (12)
---
Thx bruh imma add u
---
I know.right?
---
Griefing is not limited to PvP interactions.
---
Not necessarily, cranberry bog (more specifically fissure site prime) is very popular to nuke because it spawns the scorchbeast queen. Whitespring is popular because of the glowing ghouls that spawn. 
---
That’s true. I’d pay 2 to 3k for those. Hell what else can I do with caps.
---
Just leave the server if someone's being annoying.
---
They have a less than 1% drop chance at the vendor, and cost around 500 when they do spawn. I suggest bumping your price to 2000.  
---
No, it’s just that those are the most popular places to nuke. A large portion of the Forest is a no-nuke zone because that’s the newbie training grounds essentially but Charleston isn’t off limits.
---
Yeah come tuck me in and don’t get a paper cut off my blankets
---
I agree, but he has been trying to justify slapping people to death 
---
Sure
---
Nice thank you 
---
Same on Xbox. Played last week fine. Now getting same error code. 
---
Ah I see. Makes total sense. Plus I'm sure the more popular flora spawns in these places more.
---
Correct.  A video of you staring at the known plan and then showing your perk tree and the weapon crafting menu.
---
That was not a mistake. If you add up all the resist types of every possible armor combination, that combination has the most total points, despite having 0 rad resist.
---
My camp is lakeside, so Every time I’m cooking, I run to water and spam collect button. You’ll pick up rads. I have a Decon Arch right there to fix. 
---
Then be sure to equip Super Duper and spam build button on boiled water. Helps if you are well rested and maybe part of a team with Inspirational as you’ll get a steady flow of tiny XP while creating it. 
---
Been doing that since day 1. I only use purified water for crafting stims and vegetable starch. 
---
Makes sense. I'm glad there is some restriction.
---
I’ve been two handed melee build since day 1. All Rise is awesome but I personally feel best melee Weapon in game is Anti Armor Grognak Axe with Swing Speed, And +1 Strength. 
---
It feels like that's about 60% of my legendary drops. But I can't remember specifically what I got from that nuke it was a few months ago. 
---
Alright thanks man I'll keep that in mind tbh I'm still not 100% sure  since I've hit people and it takes more than a few seconds like in some instances its like they are immortal and have to switch to a ranged weapon then suddenly they take some damage. 
---
No one is one shotting anyone that is in pacifist mode you either hit them or u had a workshop or were wanted
---
Frustrating indeed
---
I did this quest 4 times, on 4 different characters. By the 3rd and 4th time I knew exactly what to do so I ran through it very impatiently lol
---
I have soldier and toothy if wanna trade 
---
No I can't login at all. Just checked after rebooting and waiting, I still can't login. 
---
East of horizons rest. Southwest of Morgantown. Please remember that there are children who use this website too.
---
Replying months later to confirm that, for me at least, the crackling sound driving me crazy was in fact the All Rise. 
---
PSN- idsmashthat336 
---
It’s right beside my camp....
---
Helvitia is how its pronounced 
---
It's better than when the RNG gods decide to revoke the whole creature. I went to cranberry glades today to finish up a challenge that required me to visit that place and there was a 2 star Queen Mirelurk there. I thought... well I better tag it first just in case someone else is in the area. I got it in VATS and shot it and \*poof\*. Gone. Just... gone. I searched the whole area. It didn't die, turn to a meat pile, teleport to it's spawn point, or anything else I've seen before.. it just vanished.
---
Do you not run with Crit Savvy? Breaking point should be just 15 if you're using the maxed version of that perk
---
It’s hard to tell when to give up and assume nothing was found of interest. Plus, the slider thing is annoying. 
---
I’ve slapped a player to death because they were tying up a vendor.  Should I have waited up to half an hour instead?
---
I tryed and am still getting the login failed 4:8:2000 message...
---
Helvetia is center map, in the forest, directly east of flatwoods
---
Thank you, I’m just an idiot I didn’t find it weird how 8 people are in the same location on the map 
---
I hope they stick with 2-4 players group events or raids...on consoles you get stutters when more players join any activity...it's really annoying.
---
East of Flatwoods is Sutton, a little further east is Helvetica. It's exactly west of the crashed plane (Horizon's Rest) on the map
---
I just want to se me one person with one of these so I know I’m not wasting my time. I’ve seen the boys wearing a sun one too. 
---
Damn, I didnt even realize that was a quest. That must have been that weird one that magically finished without me doing anything during the beta 
---
This was the best quest I've ever done in my entire life. Made my terrible FO 76 experience a little bit better.
---
Kudos to whoever created this. &gt;!game still garbage tho!&lt;
---
Osha dont do shit for mining. MSHA is the go to for giving those citations...
---
Last escort mission I did, ended up with a hangover and $200 poorer.....
---
Which did you want ? 
---
Is that a Gatling Plasma in your pocket or are-  [dies]
---
Toothy is straight 
---
quite a few
---
250? 
---
Just 5 from what I have seen. Solder,  witch, toothy, owl, and giant. + old man summer an atom shop. 
---
Just east of Sutton station
---
Makes sense! But I'd better buy paint specifically for x-01 for like 500-700, bc I don't really care for other armor types and I think many of us do. 
---
Let it be more expensive, than buying it in a bundle (like 1800/4 &lt; price of a separate lot), but for Todd's sake make it happen, Bethesda!
---
I also find that ransoms (non Reddit players) are often blown away by cap prices on weapons. AND some get super offended when you tell them something isn’t for sale. Hello, you bump into me at WestTek and expect me to sell the 3*** weapon I’m currently holding and using to kill level 62 Super mutants for 500 caps? 
---
When I list reasonable, realistic values on some weapons, they message me and say “way overpriced”, yet I’m pretty sure I’m one of the lowest priced sellers on Xbox. 
---
One guy even asked why I would attempt to get more for an item than what the game says it’s worth!!!! 
---
That one made me almost shoot sprite through my nose. 
---
I only tune in to see if Country Roads is on, if not then I want nothing to do with the radio
---
There is a old camp site just down the road from the overseers camp that is right by the stream. Makes it easy to spam  "collect" at the stream then turn around  and boil is at the camp site. 
---
I played the beta and I just feel significantly nerfed compared to now which is kinda sad.
---
Technically a Soldier Mask, but masks and helmets seem touse the same slot, so I guess either works.
---
You can server hoop to active events
---
Lmao you look like you need mike wasowskis papers but you’ve lost weight 
---
It would be nice if event loot was on a knock out list - ie. once you get an item, you cant get it again until you have all items from said event pool
---
Ty 
---
I haven’t had a problem. Got a DENSE chest piece?
---
I've only been to one other nuke zone: Charleston, i think.   There was NOTHING to do except very very few monsters.
---
Yes, week long. 
---
No prob I appreciate it!
---
57 here and playing Fallout from the beginning and still have my old pong game as well. If your on PC (Adama1a), I'll be glad to help you launch that first nuke. I haven't launch mine yet but will have to soon as I run mostly solo.
---
What about the jester?
---
You'll need to find a saint to have someone give you those plans for 100 caps. Maybe you'll have better luck on ps4. That or raise your offer to 500-1000c to start...
---
48 here and my wife gives me grief, but supports and accepts me. Only flak I really get is from my 14 and 10 year old sons who want the Xbox for Fortnite. Haven’t converted them (yet). 
---
I haven’t gotten it or seen another playing with it. Same with old man winter, sun, and skull. 
---
East coast
---
Me too. Idk how many other learned plans have been "forgotten" and I'm kinda scared to look
---
Old man winter
---
Those are probably the rarest ones...
---
I spent my 1000 caps on plans but dw dude. I didn't know they were that much. How do you find them?
---
Trial hopping FTW!!
---
1k
---
Thank you!
---
Theres like 12 people all shooting it at once I doubt it's just one of the few TSE people killing it every time by themselves to get that sweet, sweet level 30 1* legendary.. 
---
Good, good.
---
Aahhh ok. That makes sense. I think I made it stop tracking that a while back because I was way early in the game and wasn't even close to considering traveling that far yet. I guess I need to get that back up and run through that then. Thanks a lot!!
---
Old man winter is blue XD
---
With the mechanics of moving objects in the game engine I couldn’t imagine this going very smoothly. How many times have you seen a cart in Skyrim freak the fuck out or a vertibird/vertibot just do some stupid stuff? Me? A lot! A train that people with power armor would try to stand in front of all day or people would try to lead a super mutant behemoth to trying to get it to stop a scripted moving object, it wouldn’t work out very good. Also a lot of the tracks either have dead ends, broken or blocked by game world textures. Sorry but no hope for it. I doubt we’ll even see vertibird rides in the future especially with giant flying bats in the sky to clip through or knock out of wack. 
---
Way more than 5. There are 5 bots aho always change. Closer to 15-17
---
I dont have a card to use for the trial and it says my PayPal pw is wrong when I know it's right. That's why I'm so bitter right now. By the time I can pay all the temporary even stuff will be gone :(
---
I've given a couple explosive weapons away today...
---
Would you like some mutations? Maybe something to speed up your trigger finger?
---
Unfortunately everything in my arsenal is just powerful. A 68 scourged is at best getting 2 melee hits, 2 or 3 rounds from any gun. We cannot cart around pipe guns to please the masses. What about the 1 shot 1200 damage melee guys?
---
Seems as if all the unsuspended players are suspended again, there are other posts going on here.
---
If you’re like me, and like to run roads and actual paths to places, you would have run into this place on your way to Morgantown 
---
No stutters? When I get more than 4 players at one place the game for me starts to stutters like crazy.
---
I thought it might be a reference to that Flight of the Conchords song 'Robots' to be honest. This makes more sense now that you translated, hah
---
I saw someone with a Fasnacht Beret. It was orange and had black squares. Has anyone else seen something like that?
---
I did the exact same thing when I first started playing lol 
---
Fantastic.
---
Lucky you didn't die and lose it all.
---
Are you on PS4?   I would like to bring you some free loot for making me laugh....
---
That was a very common occurrence during the B.E.T.A.
---
I've got a friend, same thing. Banned again. I just posted to check if there were others. 
---
Get a Gatling gun and put the quick receiver on. Legit
---
PS4. Same here
---
Nope, the first two I did had 6 or more participants and no issues
---
🤣 Best thing I read today. Lol
---
Oh ok. In other words you've come up with complete, left field speculations in order to compensate for the fact that you don't know what you're talking about. Makes sense now. I think it's best we call this a stalemate. 
---
Plus signs :D That's the flag of switzerland (white cross) lol
---
Thanks for the information! will be on the lookout for donuts
---
I did this with the camo skin for my two legendary hunting rifles. Now they cant be sold or lost without a warning that doing so will destroy the weapon.
---
I like the event too, although it could A: stand to happen a bit more often and B: have a more intelligent reward mechanism, like the Powered Up quests, that doesn't reward you the same mask over and over again.
---
It reminds me of the One Violent Night quest, only with a lot more variation.
---
theres like 40 threads on this, it bugs the intestine quest so you cannot continue
---
&gt; Bere
---
Did you get that instead of the mask?
---
Crap gets real!
---
People hate you :) cause it ruins it
---
Yes my friend, same username as here. Very kind and much appreciated ❤️
---
So I just killed him and I got a note that says he basically is supposed to fallout you around and customize an insult for you. But he's  dead now lol.
---
He will give you recipes for different fermentable beverages 
---
✊ brothers in stupidity
---
Yah I see them :( 
---
Lmao ✊
---
I understand your frustration in a high-level player coming in and dropping everything in sight, but the other side of the coin is:
---
1) That player might be restricted for time and needing to complete the event as soon as possible.
---
2) The event is high-profile, fresh and ongoing.
---
3) That player owes you nothing.
---
and my favorite
---
4) Tag faster!
---
Hahaha xD this made my day. Thank you &lt;3
---
The idea that you could be insta-killed in Pacifist has been thoroughly debunked.  You either aren't in Pacifist mode, or you have a Workshop.
---
Fissure site prime spawns a lot of nuked flora if launched at the right spot.
---
He was advocating slapping them until they fought back or server hopped. 
---
Yea, I’ve been getting those too, just wondered if any other camp plans or anything like that.
---
Only location that worked for me ty!
---
I had one camp destroyed and now it’s just a bench on the ground until it gets fixed. 
---
I mean, the franchise is old enough to drink and play at casinos, unlike a big chunk of the 76-playing population!
---
Loved that part. I had heard about it ahead of time, so I was waiting him to get in my face after being skipped. 
---
This event desperately needed to scale based on level of the participants, and the amount of participants.    Either that, or make it instanced somehow. Sometimes I even think there should be events that nullify the effects of legendary weapons so everyone can get a fair shake.
---
I like that there's some variation in the setup.  Sometimes you need to kill Honey Beasts for the Beekeeper.  Sometimes you need to gather beer steins.  But the mechanics of the "parade" itself are repetitive and not terribly rewarding.  We're still getting sub-Level 45 drops from the lone Legendary and the quest itself.  That really shouldn't be happening.
---
550?
---
Oh yeah, dont forget that no matter where you are in the quest of you are logged off for any reason you have to start completely over at the beginning also....
---
There’s a button on the wall on that room 
---
Top of the World has had one for me as well as Stingwings. I’ve had deathskull radscorpions in the Whitesprings. 
---
common for me has been hemlock holes defence (so far 50/50 scorps or mutants, or top of the world. 
---
He was saying that you losr ONLY your junk.
---
I was selling basic plans (typically ones you have to buy) for 50 each (lowest one in stores was like 300) and the refuse to buy it for that price, in my opinion they are a pretty good deal, I just have too many duplicates 
---
Karma for being a terrible person. Hope you learned a lesson
---
There was not. There’s one in the room with the key though.
---
Oh yeah I have the soilder mask and it does have the Napoleon hat 
---
Nope, have heard of others getting the 4:8:2000 code again today
---
Yeah swapping weapons helps and I've had some success avoiding it by turning my damage down. Not an option for PvP but for PvE running every single damage perk is overkill anyway so it's not so bad to take some off. 
---
Happening to a lot of us, same error code as the people who got suspended 
---
its part of the main quest when you need to get papers for joining the military/Brotherhood of Steel
---
800
---
Ill PM you if you're still interested.
---
There are some truly terrible nuke locations where nothing spawns. I think a friend of mine nuked the airport cause he thought all the scorched would make for a good zone but literally 5 spawned and that was it. 
---
I have had this happen at least twice, both on Uranium fever... no legendaries dropped. Very frustrating to say the least. 
---
Wow, thank you for that! I'm on vacation now and cannot see these new additions in game. Sadly I won't be able to buy the pose pack. If only that offer could be two days longer... -(
---
Btw, which poses does it include? Can you make some screens for that as well?
---
Apparently a few people are getting it for server hopping for the event?
---
I disagree. 
---
See, if only we *could* steal other people's stuff, then I'd have a legitimate reason for putting a lock on everything I own.
---
Thanks for destroying my camp. Jerkoff....
---
Sorry it took so long, while family sick atm
---
Bethesda doesn't. That's the only thing that matters.
---
No one ever said the escort life was easy. 
---
I got 2 toothys and a giant. I just want the freaking owl. I'll be super bummed if it never drops for me. 
---
You can join up on us, always looking for quality people.
---
[https://discord.gg/YtfyMnz](https://discord.gg/YtfyMnz)
---
Oh knows, words! I think it's a little much to ask someone to codeswitch to "appropriate" language on a subreddit for a mature rated game. 
---
Other paints come in a bundle for every other pa type, so I guess it's rather fair pricing. If only they'd put separate lots for each one armor type with lower pricetags...
---
They should deal 3x the damage for 3 stars and always drop 3 star gear.
---
That makes sense as I was just doing new event, it was bugging out on me (not showing objectives etc) so I closed game. When I tried to reopen, I got error code.
---
Dang.   
---
I wonder: do we get lots of points for each death upon touchdown?
---
I mean, if i am at the silo and i press Launch and my nuke kills lots of things, do i get thousands of points for everything that died?
---
This may be a stupid question, but what does TSE stand for?
---
675
---
What quest is it? I don’t think I have it yet.
---
My C.A.M.P eats my friends every time they fast travel to it, but it never tries to eat me.
---
Thank you! It definitely SUCKS. Good luck selling!
---
We all do all the quests together, including collecting guts. No matter how you cut it; no rodents, fail the event.
---
PC? I have a spare owl
---
I guess I haven't discovered the location for that yet then.
---
That wouldn't work, they drop pretty quick to anyone farming them.
---
no i wasn’t on fo76 today i’ve tried to play couple minutes ago and got that 482000 bull shit ..
---
Can you do this event more than once ?
---
Two shot explosive 
---
I think nuking an event that burns old.man winter on a bonfire is poetically appropriate.  Too bad it doesn't mesh. A super, nuclear fastnacht party would be epic.
---
Happen to me tonight, me (lvl 47) trying to farm some fusion cores at the power plant and a lvl 189 kept killing me. He could have had the workshop, all i wanted were my screws back...
---
The PvP morons love to say "but workshops are for PvP" this is why I avoid workshops. I want to play Fallout, not Fortnite.
---
Yes, it restarts every hour. Or you can server hop. Either way, you should be able to get all the masks and camp stuff if you play enough before the 26th.
---
Never said that. But you can still be harmed. 
---
At last, I won't need a mod anymore to make that rusty ol' stove nice and shiny -))
---
Anyone else fail to get a mask during one of the events? I have collected 5 masks, 2 of which are duplicates.   On the 6th event, the most recent, the server was incredibly laggy the entire event, lots of people there.  I got a set of plans but no mask. 
---
It's not just you :( this is such cr@p. 
---
I don’t remember much from 1 and 2 but I do remember 3. I liked games that take months to play rather than a few hours. Fallout and Skyrim both have that going for them. I mainly remember being disappointed that playing with power armor equiped wasn’t fun visually. I still find that with 4 and 76.  I like the screen view better without the power armor and the fusion core consumption doesn’t help.
---
On the transition from 2D to 3D, it was just amazing to me. It was similar to when I saw my first color TV. There have been many technical advances over my lifetime and I’m sure you’ll agree as you age. A cheap calculator today has more computing power than the lunar module did. Being an engineer, my technical abilities just grew enormously over my career to where I had to stop “over-calculating” my projects. I could run different scenarios all day long so I had to learn to stop when I had sufficiently covered the major issues. Studying something to death is a reality today.
---
That old joke about “I walked uphill  to school every day, both ways!” is partially true. I am currently retired and work part-time as a chemistry and physics tutor at the nearby community college. I get to tell “complaining” students how easy they have it now compared to my days. It helps them appreciate the technology advances wehave and will continue to improve.
---
Looks like they re banned everyone who was suspended :( no warning. Nothing. 
---
alright , also would you happen to know if this is the only event, I’ve seen people talk about intestines and stuff, is that part of another event 
---
I spoke to my friends and they confirm that it has happened to them and others aswell, I don’t understand 
---
   
---
the grace of the event is to get the weirdest, there are many
---
I just completed an event as a level 10 with about 15 other players there going up to level 265 or so.
---
  
---
I thought it was fun, my only issue was that I couldn't see the enemy spawns. They just showed up dead. I don't know if it was because of the high levels killing everything or whether I was lagging quite badly because of all the activity in the one area. I could see explosions with nothing (apparently) causing them, and a minute later found bits of super mutant suiciders. I also never saw a legendary anything let alone a megasloth.  
---
On the positive side I got a witch mask, so yay!
---
Posts are all coming in. It triggered the bans with the new parade thing :( doesn't make any sense.
---
I was farming materials in a shop and some guy killed me and took my junk. I left, waited till I saw him fast travel to his camp, and leveled the thing to the ground. Maybe petty, but it felt good 
---
At least it won’t be a un-playable pile for 4 months amirite??!? Lul praise the good blood;)
---
Okay, so I got both key cards and the holotape. Then I went to Ingram mansion, got the code. Then I went to the basement of whatever cabin was called. I swiped the cards, found the secret entrance, but I forgot to write down the code like a dumbass. I fast traveled back to Ingram mansion and when I came back to the cabin the door closed and know I can't get it to open again ?
---
What did I do wrong ? 
---
As someone who does this semi regularly, the only real counter to it is adding lots of high level turrets facing the work bench and the surrounding area. Or don’t contest workshops if you’re not down for some pvp. 
---
4:8:2000.. you sure that's a ban?  Happened to a friend last night and after retrying it worked and let him in.  Suspect you're jumping to conclusions, server error not ban?
---
It's everyone who was banned before :( 
---
Downvotes incoming 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
It's not even just robots. Today, a legendary Mirelurk exploded when I killed it. I am at a loss for words.
---
&gt; Lugging **485lbs** of equipment back to the overseers camp to scrap and store it. 
---
Story is so fake, who only has 485 pounds of stuff in their stash!?!?!??!?!
---
I just wanted to light the bonfire
---
57 here bud. You ain't alone. We need a AARP 76 CLAN
---
Thank you for the info. Everytime I've gone he's been cleaned out. Guess I'll have to server hop to find em 
---
Did it happen to you too? So mad rn 😂
---
My first recieved water damage, not the one I play on now. I only brought that up to give a sense of how new/old my new xbox is. Thanks for the thought though, its appreciated.
---
Thanks for the help yall :D
---
Which masks are most rare?
---
Dude lol, tbh I paid far too much for it. Selling it for 800 is already a major loss for me. 800 is the bottom
---
Yeah that’s literally the same message every got during the ban wave 4:8:2000 have you heard about that or?
---
I waited an hour restarted console game did everything I could think of..... I just don’t understand 
---
Stupid question: you are looking for "*Short* Lever Action Rifle" in the list of Machined Guns, right?
---
It happened to me as well! I thought it was because I was transferring things between my characters but your situation sounds like mine. 
---
At least someone knows their head from their ass. 
---
That's actually a bug specifically with Grognak's axe. Doesn't work with that weapon for some reason.
---
same man. Bought 4000 atoms. Now this 482000
---
There one legendary enemy that's probably too tough for a low level, but other than that it's just level 8-15 creatures/mutants. 
---
If my razorgrain could stop floating about two inches off the ground I'd be willing to submit my garden into some kinda garden contest.
---
Best post ever on here. Lol lol lol lol
---
Not me, a close friend. He's so pissed. Like mega raging. Trying to calm him. He had just given me 12k caps to hold then couldn't log back in. We thought it was the high value trade. 
---
Geez if it’s happening to this many people just right this second something’s clearly gone wrong 😂 
---
I don't understand what you mean by " place a custom marker on top of the player "?
---
Ok we should start a 40+ team. I usually try to catch an hour or so a day, between 7 &amp; 8 PM east coast time
---
Xbox 1 platform.
---
Sandhog147 is the gamer tag. Look me up. A few old fuckers could overcome a lot of bullshit
---
They pop up near the gazebo at whitespring sometimes. 
---
Yeah I bought the old man summer mask the horn thing the excavated power armour paint and then bam hit with this 
---
More likely that the joke is just the 1s and 0s, no deeper message.
---
Still cool!
---
For real, this gun is a beast and the range on it is stellar as well. I feel like I'm firing a laser guided cannon when I use this.
---
Maybe the unban was the mistake as most still had all the items they were banned for. 
---
What's your xbox name, I'll look ya up.
---
&gt;I’ve been doing Recruitment Blues
---
I am able to load and play randomly. Ive owned it since release and have been able to limp to lv 73. 
---
Tech documents are random spawns, generally in desks and filling cabinets, although you might find one randomly on any of the enemies. I lucked out one time after dropping one tech doc off I was clearing out the security cage by the power frames, and found a tech doc there. You will only show 1 in your inventory regardless of how many you have. 
---
i sent a ticket. Just gonna see what they say (if they even reply)
---
You only need to turn in one at a time. They don't stack. It's all RNG. 
---
I’m close to raging but I’m trying to get to the bottom of this, seems like enough people have been randomly hit that it will make enough noise and Bethesda will investigate 
---
True, I will ask my buddy to see if that was the case
---
..... im sure that happened 
---
As far as I know there's a bug that turns in all the technical data you have in your inventory at once. Best plan was to only bring 2 at a time. That's all I know so far.
---
easily googleable i'd imagine?
---
i'm interested for sure.
---
I’m going to send one too (thought they didn’t reply to my last one)
---
You can move it so put it anywhere you like. My advice is to make the footprint as small as possible, first floor is just stairs to a big second floor. Then you don’t have to worry about uneven ground when you move it. 
---
If it's triggered by the event, maybe it's just a glitch - something that triggers the ban by mistake.
---
Not going to lie. I did the exact same thing at level 6. Thought I hit the jackpot.......lol
---
Or just use a low level alt with zero caps
---
Do you happen to remember which region gave you BoS plans? I have a bunch of treasure maps and no BoS plans on an alt I've got to lvl 40. (thanks!)
---
Basically a reverse fermenter so hopefully!
---
I was curious about this myself 
---
Today’s my first day off work in a while and I was enjoying the game so sad 😂😂😂😂
---
I hope you’re right man 
---
I believe you need the appropriate under armor in your inventory before you can see the ability to mod it. I have the enclave shielded plan (known) but no enclave under armor and I don’t see the ability to mod enclave under armor. 
---
Ah okay thank you!
---
Directly southeast of New Gad, it's the green roofed building on the map next to the water
---
Yes
---
If you own a workshop, but are somewhere else on the map, especially in a building, they can place a marker on the map to know where you last were, then fast travel to attack you away from the camp they're contesting. Less frequently happens but is absolutely worth it to get the jump on high level player. From the attacker's perspective at least.
---
Green roof cabins just north east of white spring, you either get bears, rad scorpions or honeybees, just server hop until they show up, normally 3 of each each time consistently.
---
Nope, the intestines are part of this as well. It's a bizarre event but then again...  
---
So is Mardi Gras
---
Destroying items instead of dropping them when over 1,500lbs was the solution for the suspended people. 
---
We were all dumb once, at least you didn't lose your gear!
---
Some of us put ALL of our gear into the overseer's chest in flatwoods, right when the game released. The one that everyone loots upon the first visit to the church. Definitely wasn't me, not at all... 
---
How....how would that be a bug though? 
---
My PSN is gofukyurslf326
---
Well, only got those who were max over weight. 
---
I hardly have that but I’ll buy it man
---
u/Valseek are you able to confirm?
---
They’re pretty common in the Divide. Especially as you approach the lift for Top of the World. 
---
SYG Resurge doing new event rn join in if you can
---
West Virginia born and raised son. On the strip mine is where I spent most of my days.
---
Yeah finally did it today and nothing is in a super hard to spot location. The easiest to miss thing is likely the card behind the bathroom door. People would have figured this all out by now purely by accident.
---
Even then, most PVP players roll with dense mod so rocket turrets hit like a wet paper towel. If I'm playing with friends I'll switch over to my bloody cavalier guy and grief the ever loving shit out of them. But if you're solo there's no way to rejoin their server since most of them block you anyways.
---
No way man, they are usually quite entertaining.
---
I didn’t play the event at all today, went to login for the first time today and got this message. I am guessing something they did when turning the quest on triggered it.
---
Haven't been about to complete the event because it is always nuked.
---
Were you wrongfully banned because you picked up duped items and kept it?
---
You on Xbox?
---
Yeah, I wonder if we could get a senior discount?
---
https://youtu.be/5tTVXcuMNnQ
---
Since i did all that stuff and got nothing. 
---
This reminds me of my wife’s Skyrim story. She bought it at release then returned it a week later. I found out later that she didn’t like it because she got over encumbered and didn’t know how to drop anything. She was trying to play the whole game over encumbered for almost a week before she gave up on it.
---
I love this post lol thanks for the chuckle 😀
---
Anyone else having issues with people constantly nuking the event? 
---
The Forest Region is great to start because enemy spawns are small and weak. Two strategically placed basic turrets should keep your camp in one piece. 
---
Never duped in the game, and never picked up or kept any gigantic stacks of anything, Bethesda yet to reply to the original ban ticket so I can’t tell you what they think I did wrong. But in any case I was unbanned in the 17th of March (been playing nonstop with friends because was so happy) and today on my day off I play the new parade get some new masks buy some atomic shop things and get banned
---
So, the only TSEs I have that can one-shot things are my pump action and double barrel. And even then, only high level ghouls and sometimes scorched. And besides that...I’ll prepare myself for the downvoted right now. If you get even one bullet into something, you get credit when it dies. So even if all you have is a level 1 hunting rifle, that’s all you’d need to get experience and loot. 
---
u/Valseek can you comment?
---
Literally the only reason I make orbital strike beacons! I honestly don't think I've used one for anything else except for testing the first one MODUS gives you.
---
Of course it was wrongfully. Like everyone else, right?
---
Let's hope this time is permanent.
---
Psn luckyjayhawk. Add me up
---
Wow you’re a clown 😂
---
Quest may also be bugged. After several times finding the doors open I decided to go to the bunker first to check the door. So I get there and it says you need a key . Then the door magically opens by itself. I enter and no plans. But while standing there the door closes and the junk in the room starts to disappear. I server hopped several times with the same results. Anyone know what's going on?
---
T-51 (level 50) has the highest damage resistance (DR) and energy resistance (ER) but not the highest radiation resistance (RR):
---
DR/ER/RR: 514 / 514 / 370
---
X-01 (level 50) does not have the highest damage resistance but has almost the highest energy resistance and the highest radiation resistance:
---
DR/ER/RR: 458 / 513 / 513
---
Excavator power armor comes with +100 carry weight. However, there are calibrated shock mods for each power armor set that gives +50 carry weight for each leg meaning any power armor can get +100 carry weight provided you get two calibrated shock mods (1 for each leg). Even the Excavator power armor can reach +200 carry weight this way.
---
I would suggest using Excavator power armor until you get calibrated shocks for both legs of T-51. Then use T-51 for normal gameplay and X-01 for high radiation environments (like nuke zones). You must get rank 3 Power Patcher perk to drastically reduce the repair cost. I would not suggest using Ultracite, Raider, T-45, or T-60 power armors.
---
Sorry that you are salty, friend.
---
Hey, why don't you jump in Fallout 76 to relax? Oh... right...
---
Then they abandon the workshop right after they take it. Sounds like workshops are only for PVP in some people's minds. I don't mind PVP, but the way they have it set up is so unbalanced, between punishing high level players and allowing gamey sneak attacks to score a quick buck there's just too much there that can get in the way of (the sometimes fun) PVP in this game.
---
I mean I can always go on my brothers account and play but he’s level 15 
---
Keep it coming troll ❤️
---
Perhaps you should do that then, instead of coming here with your tantrum.
---
That’s not a bug. You failed to complete the mission in time. What, you want a participation trophy?
---
Nah, for every issue people may have with this game (valid or not) - the one thing I’ve come to love with it is how great the community is. 
---
I’ve encountered 3 “griefers” in 100+ hours so far, and 2/3 of them were funny. I have a hard time seeing this group ruining an event (and a nuke) on this event.
---
Again hope you’re right haha
---
See you out there! Sounds like you're having a blast!
---
Enjoy your supper! 
---
I'm gonna shoot ya a friend request dude. I'm in U.S. Mountain Time Zone and play evenings and weekends
---
I believe Harper’s has them. Or Watoga. One of them does. 
---
Nah I even googled last night, trying to find that error, and there was no results... nothing like "I got an email saying I was banned and now I get 4:8:2000".  People who got banned also got an email from Bethesda telling them, have you had that?  I'd definitely open a support case.  Don't assume you're banned unless you get told that specifically.  I'm only so sure, because my friend did get back in last night which seems most unlikely he was banned.
---
They will have to 
---
We used to get regular posts about people ‘raiding’ other people’s stashes lol. I actually hope survival has a mechanic like that.
---
Not yet - but I guess people are going to start doing it a lot now as people just frak with everyone else
---
https://youtu.be/U2TD3Yz62XM
---
I always found the mods in watoga
---
So we too could love the smell of napalm in the morning
---
Ok I must be stupid, I still don't follow xD  If you're not at the workshop does it show them where you are on the map?  Or do they just have to hunt around and find you?  Is it because they become wanted so can't see you any more, which is why the marker is useful?
---
T-51b is the second best in the game for resistances, with the X-01 being better notably for rad resistance. Ultracite comes in third, T-60 fourth, then T-45, Excavator, and Raider. 
---
I think I just answered my own question xD
---
57 here - playing since the DOS days and have pretty much all the consoles as well as an Alienware PC.
---
Why would they warn you, though?
---
your banned
---
If only you were a 76 year old playing 76, grow up... sheesh
---
I mean during the ban wave I got this exact same error message (4:8:2000) and an email saying I was temp banned/ suspended and heaps of people got it too most deserved it for their duping, 
---
I haven’t gotten an email yet but I’ll keep you posted, just freaking out and I guess jumping the gun because I just got unbanned and now this happens (same message) look in the comments of this post apparently it’s happening pretty wide spread 
---
Appreciate it
---
Thanks that worked
---
Literally just happened...so f***ing annoying
---
For **you**, sure. What about the low-levels that don’t have good power armor or rad suits to deal with the radiation. Sounds like a major problem for them. 
---
Why would they bother to lift the ban at all only to wait a week and do it again? 
---
Thankfully the game isn't in english, but oh lord the translation bugs are equally annoying as this would be.
---
I did the same thing with a random stash box in a gas station thinking someone dumped into it while they did a scrap run at their base but realized half through it was all my stuff. It was during beta. 
---
Work around for the unlovable sloth! It always gets dismembered. I found looting the arms, legs, head, gore is usually where the loot is. 
---
No, don't think so.   Haven't been yet, so I doubt that.
---
I've got mine placed just south of Morgantown right now for easy access to the nukashine dailies and cheap travel to the fasnacht event. I used to keep my camp outside Watoga for easy access to the vendors there and since most of the busy work I was doing was in the area. In general just place it where ever is convenient to the sort of work you're doing right now - remember that you get free fast travel to vault 76 and your camp so it's usually best to place further away from the vault so you can save on fast travel costs (right now I'm lazy - I could just run from the vault each time). Like it's already been pointed out though, you can move your camp at any time so don't stress too much and look forward to hitting yourself when you realise you've been playing without easy access to repair stations and your stash for the last few weeks. 
---
I got the Greek letters plan too
---
Either the lift was unintended, or this new ban is unintended.
---
I hope it's the former.
---
Well they already gave morgantown and helvetica a significant facelift. And I think atleast the morgantown one is permanent. And they changed all chemistry stations at brewing locations to the new brewing stations so I think its going in that direction. :)
---
I'm pretty sure nukes don't actually kill enemies, the enemies are just replaced with higher level versions. 
---
Any idea of where giant ants might spawn? I usually see a couple at the teapot quest, but most of the time it is just bugs and mole rats.
---
This. I like this 
---
Not my call either way. But I agree someone messed up somewhere. 
---
*after rewards*? How nice of them.
---
Someone one-shot me at the beginning of the event (yes, I owned a workshop), and that started an all out war that lasted the entire event. Everyone kept killing the two guys who started it, while they whined in zone voice chat that they "didn't do anything" and other hilarious nonsense.
---
It was kinda fun. 
---
i got the snowflake, but i can't find it in my wall or floor decor, where is it hiding?
---
I seem to be having the same issue! I can’t find it anywhere.
---
its true it was all a big freaking joke! so i traded a dude who had 3million bobble heads for a 100k of them for 20k caps...i got banned for it, months go by and i get a message from a buddy saying they are removing bans. im like cool so i log in play 4 or 5 hours then decide to goback and finish other games im into. So today i log in figure i'll make some trades do some events and BAM i'm banned again! really bethesada what kind of joke is this!  My kid still plays on his account so i know its just mine who is on lockdown. 
---
I have the same issue and I was literally taking a shit and came back to being logged out due to that message error code. Just when I hoped things were getting better and now I can’t play 😫
---
Ha that’s awesome! I was fighting some super mutants today and Graham decided to stop by and help out lol it was great
---
Its made from PEOPLE!
---
😂😂😂😂 really 😂😂 
---
Sorry to hear man
---
Cool good luck!! hope it works out ok!! But definitely go open that support case.  And keep trying?  Maybe just a borked server somewhere..
---
Sweetie... That would be the "Pi" he's referring to
---
wait yall dont have those?
---
I haven't been able to complete it a single time because of it.
---
Once they're actively hostile, they can't see you. But they can go to where you last were. They're not wanted though. 
---
They immediately turn Red
---
Caution/danger and you will see them now as red dots on the compass. They remain yellow on the map.
---
Atom shop my dude lmao 
---
is it called merman mask? looks like the giant mask to me
---
:(
---
Bethesda should have thought of that and extended the no nuke zone, or place events inside the safe zone
---
Misc. Structures!
---
Anyone know what it looks like. Got a picture? Cause the image that is shown is diffrent then the image when you scroll. And im curiose if its that blue or cool red n black
---
Too much endge on those blankets.
---
you can
---
oh, duh.  thanks :)
---
oh, i thought the plan was to craft the actual underarmor....  it wasnt a boxed mod... i got it a railroad vendor under the plans category
---
im so confused! 
---
You completed 3 events and you’re freaking out?!? Holy crap. Life is gonna suck big time for you. Relax play it a handful of times. It’s all RNG. 
---
Oh. I don't check that enough lol
---
You did not pull up when I searched 
---
But being low level and joining SBQ event is okay????
---
Yeah, the mod (ability) to make shielded and whatnot on under armor are learned from a plan. 
---
Will you add me pan is UncleMartypp7 
---
You can find the Union Unfiorm but not the hat, the hat you’re thinking about is the Top Hat.
---
I realize I spelled excited wrong but it’s too late now
---
Following
---
UPDATE: This is the page from the Fallout Wiki
---
“One Union Hat can be found in a small graveyard directly eastward and not far away from Hopewell Cave in the Savage Divide; the same graveyard is Northeast of The Sons of Dane Compound. This location is easily accessible by following the path marked on the world map leading from near the Pumpkin House to the Cave”
---
Hobby lobby. Dont go on Sundays though as they’re closed.
---
They’re super-light. They don’t require ballistic fibre to repair. Every Shrouded mod increases both your stealth ability and your sneak speed. I now sneak faster than walking, and mobs will literally pass me by if I’m crouched. Scorched will *bump into me* and still go around. 
---
Yup.
---
Yes. I checked my haul from yesterday. No union hat
---
Sort by value, it might be weight actually, but they’re always at the top when sorting that
---
agreed. 2k it is.
---
Lore wise, fusion generators drain fusion cores. In Nuka world, you get a special dialogue if you pull the core from the fusion generator before the fight, stating you killed 30% of the arena power. This can be construed to mean that the generator has a backup system for the failure or removal of a core, which explains the flicker when you pull one, and its continued operation. 
---
But they can’t charge cores.
---
Nah .. it's about the C.A.M.P. emote.  Says on their site it would be 50% off (150 instead of 300) from March 19 until March 20.  It's not.  
---
Does everyone understand?
---
It’s fine all worked out
---
Much better community over there, less jaded
---
Hey old timer, if you want I can install a handicap ramp on my ~~walk in furnace~~ base for you 
---
Then the reward pool needs to be better lmao.
---
I’ve got mine right on a cliff, it’s got an awesome view! 
---
This is a bad post and you should feel bad for posting it! :)
---
If you’re wearing the Fascnacht Man Mask, the one with the long nose, the Master of Ceremonies will ask you, “You haven’t been lying, have you?”
---
Okay got them installed, thanks again everyone for the help! I would have never guessed I could do that with the other items greyed out like it was showing...
---
Renamed it to .ini.Old 
---
Oh. I didn't know. Thanks. 
---
I’ll buy it
---
Oh
---
I don’t have that
---
Yea there is a update after download if u were banned before you will be banned again. But you will have the option of buying 10k atom points to get rereleased
---
Fire first, fire fast... that’s my motto
---
Thanks!
---
I thank u all for your support and I hope this can be brought to **Bethesda's** attention.
---
The three day unban was a funny joke on bethesdas part.....they are falling out their chairs with laughter right now.
---
it very well could be linked to the timed event
---
If you already have the technical data and the quest doesn’t appear they won’t work. 
---
You have to find one and then the drop request quest will start.
---
Yes they stack, and it's based on your total hp.  Rads is the best way to keep it low :)
---
Yep, I was on a world and I got that message "World is shutting down for maintenance" or whatever. I had never seen it before. Also I checked the map and there was only me and one other person on the server as far as I could tell.
---
I find acid to to be an invaluable resource. I found a nice little acid resource location next to a copper deposit northwest of Arkos Pharmaceutical. Plenty of space for some farming. Low level enemies only. Once you get the excavator armor, you can farm 12 copper ore, collect some acid, smelt and sell for a decent amount of caps in no time. 
---
Why would that trigger a ban/suspension and not let people log in tho 
---
Have played last 2 days after ban was lifted (they took nothing from my account by the way), then forced to close game as the new quest was being buggy, tried to reopen and bam error code.
---
Only if there is still a box that can’t be looted
---
Maybe if your stash is full you can put stuff in normal containers 
---
I think the point is that there has to be other people there.  It is a parade after all
---
lol i just did the event for the first time and that happened exactly as u described. jeez
---
You didn’t get anything because you didn’t finish the event. That’s not the game’s fault; it’s yours. Gonna sound harsh, but maybe you should’ve done everything to get the reward. 
---
Yes, they stack. I run a full Unyielding Bloodied build. My stats are all around 30 except for endurance.
---
I run around at about 20% health. And it doesn’t matter if your health is dropped because of rads or if your health is low in general with no rads. Still works the same.
---
I have a stupid question. And I've never played any of the other Fallout except for 76.
---
I see people call them vertibirds. In fact, the main guy that plays with me calls then vertibirds. But the name says vertibot. Why is that? 
---
Yeah the only time the game had problems with that was the dupe glitch, but you’re right, you never seemed to lose items you found just before or anything of that sort.
---
I did this a couple times, though, I only took a few things and I still have to remind myself that those stash boxes are showing my gear. 
---
I've had them drop several times from the scorchbeast queen after completing the event.
---
I'm so happy this wasn't just me! 
---
Well, let’s see....I’ve got this mostly useless Shishkebab that might work...
---
Not quite.  If you have a bunch in your stash can take one out and server hop. After you hop,  put it in a world container and then pick it back up. The quest will trigger at that point.  Kind of annoying process but it works. 
---
Don’t be too anxious about it. Place it and then move it if you have to 
---
Don’t waste your time on people just making shit up.
---
So no spell checkers are active in whatever resource-building software they use?
---
Then again I work for a medical supply company and our website had a glaring typo on our live site. Ugh
---
Honestly, that doesn't sound so bad.
---
Maybe have one container that's the STASH, universal to all players, but if players want to leave behind items for players (or make gauntlets for high-level items, which would add *a lot* of gameplay), they could leave them in special containers.
---
My preference would be like two variants of each container, one STASH, one "loot". 
---
The last event I did had level 40+ versions of all the mobs. Except the legendary sloth, it was still just 35. It was a lot more fun though. 
---
They're extremely difficult to acquire. Best bet is probably events in the Savage Divide, but there aren't many of those and I'm not sure which drop armor plans. Maybe treasure maps too, but I didn't have any luck with those in the Savage Divide.
---
You only need one raider plan in the long run though, preferably light arms for mod harvesting.
---
This is how it's gone with many things Bethesda has claimed they fixed, that in actuality, are not. I'm getting sick of it. Especially the Sneak "fixes". 
---
The TSE shotguns aren't that powerful anymore though.
---
For me the radio start to play when my CAMP has been loaded
---
I have plans for the civil war era suit and the union hat. I think the dress too. Only one I don't have at the moment is the top hat. Make me an offer.
---
brb have a lot of families to dishonor.
---
I would love to team up. I'm 43 and have also played all fallouts. I have been hesitant to join teams as have been put off by all the kids when I played elder scrolls. 
---
My name on psn name is xael501st. 
---
I'll send you a friend request raddiationdaddy👍🏻
---
Things were a little buggy this evening. Couldn't join teams and then got logged out with an error code I've never seen before. Instead of trying to log back in, I shut it down for the night. Gotta go do the work thing tomorrow anyway and I'm old, so I need my beauty rest.
---
Bethesda: *Sees this post. "We are buffer Ng and nerfing already existing armour and adding a few new sets into the game."
---
Too late... when I created this topic i was already downloading... does the game works now?
---
Don't do the fasnacht for legendaries, there's only one at the end and it's not even top level.
---
Sorry, I'm actually sold put of that one
---
Hmm so I’m trying to get mods for the chest piece. So scrapping any part of the raider armor can get me mods for the chest piece?
---
Same here, but some of them kept throwing grenades and mines at some of us. I had to fight for my life just to get the end prize. 
---
Happened to me on the first.  I didn't even realize i could get a mask until i read about on here
---
I was wondering if one of you guys could comment on this? /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/BethesdaGameStudios /u/Ladydevann 
---
Fasnacht beret. It's a reward from the new event
---
I have an extra toothy btw
---
Great post! 50 here and I pretty much PVP full time. Happy to take a break from murdering the youth to help launch a nuke if you’re on XBox.
---
Is part of the fasnacht parade rewards
---
Bruh, I love arguing with you. Thanks for the fun. 
---
Same here as well. My buddy as well. Transparency is needed.
---
I think anyone who says they never looted a stash box once is a damn liar. That’s hilarious. I remember thinking “wow, look at all this free shit!...oh, dammit!”
---
I recived that beret Fasnacht event reward
---
I had a guy using a mini nuke
---
U TOO BAPPO??.. DANG
---
Actually, there is a button, but it is not visible for some reason.  if you put your cursor on the keypad, and then move it right, you will get the prompt for the button to open the wall back up.
---
Fasnacht Beret! I’m currently uploading a screenshot of it. Should have a good pic of it up shortly.
---
there is one in a building at Harper's ferry, looks like the place of a murder suicide 
---
Thank you! This one gave me a good chuckle. 
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhh ok :) Thanks!
---
53 here, jeez you guys are old.
---
I kinda wish there were penalties like this for dying. Losing junk feels meaningless 90% of the time tbh 
---
I, for one, read it as “hell-vet-ee-a,” and never gave it a second thought. 
---
must have been an accidental un ban or an accidental re ban
---
It’s only 800 atoms which is less than half of all previous paint jobs. A pretty fair deal considering it’s a decent paint. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
The problem is that the quest itself is pretty low level 
---
Pretty sure you get the plans at the top of fort defiance. They put them in one of the terminals because of this exact reason
---
Currwntly, probably not. I did the parade four times and got plans for the effigy twice. 
---
Wait till the event ends, and it'll be worth a lot to people who didn't do it.
---
I don’t think there are plans for stealth boys. Honestly though chameleon armor does the same thing and as long as you sneak there really isn’t a difference. 
---
red or blue? and if its red is it the same as the atom shop?
---
Any chance you can remove the mannequin? xD  Or is that just there for the store image?
---
That’s true, I just wanted them for PVP
---
I'm level 53 and just did this a couple of days ago for a few mins until I realized. 
---
I want it bad, but I'm gonna wait until the event ends next week to try and buy it off someone. Would hate to spend caps and then get it dropped as a reward haha
---
I am wearing out my spacebar from cooking. 
---
I got the couch plan from a workshop I haven't found the TV yet
---
I think I will get it tomorrow!
---
Damn that's good I've had mine at about 265/100/0 and my chest isn't even legendary which sucks.
---
Need meself a 3* metal cheat piece 
---
Good point. Should have asked that first. PS4.
---
Server hop Watonga and harpers ferry for TV plans 👍

Random encounters. It's a dead guy wearing the suit. He has a plan for one of the items on him. I lucked out and found him twice. Got a union uniform and a civil war era top hat.
---
Best place to check is the road south of point pleasent (mothman museum) between there and the flatwoods area. My camp used to be around there and i'd check the encounter point every time hoping for something good.
---
Dang, im on xbox. Thanks for the offer though!
---
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
---
I know.  I don't like that their comeback is, "Well...don't take workshops."  I don't think it's fair to players that absolutely have no desire to PvP to force them to do so or basically lock them out of content.  
---
I like workshops.  It provides a steady source of XP, Caps, Plans, and resources.  I have no desire to fight for them however.  If you want it, take it.  I'll find my own.  But don't force me to drop unnecessary caps or to abandon this aspect of the game when it's something I enjoy doing.
---
I really hope SURVIVAL will drive most of the PvP away from the regular world.  
---
Nice things about stealth boys is they are active while you run. You can usually find one in one of the showers of the whitesprings villas. Also on one of the busses in watoga
---
I placed a dumpster out by the the ammo Depot workshop and my friend who hardly ever plays was surefire excited and about did the same thing but I was there to stop him 😂
---
Thanks, i will try that!
---
I'm ... 37. Yeah, that's it. I'm at the age where I have to think about that a sec. 
---
Anyway, my wife plays games with me sometimes and if there's a big release coming out that I'm excited about she'll find a book to dive into or a podcast to binge or something.
---
This isn't meant to gloat, I questioned even commenting here, but just to add to the voices that you aren't being childish by gaming. How many middle-aged people simply plop down in front of the TV for hours a night? At least you're doing something that requires thought, right?
---
"A big part of the game is ruining a big part of the game"
---
Hush youngster or we'll send you too the wood shack. 🤣 This comment will most likely have many of the younger set scratching their heads. 🤔
---
It might but the PvP players who just want to be bullies will stick around. My suggestion is they create a PVE server with time limits on workshops. Or workshop prices go up every time someone claims it. So you claim it for 20 if I want it it's 40 if you want to take it back it's 60 and so on. 
---
Thank you for this info, I heard from others t60 is easier to repair
---
I can never find the dude, so I’m gonna be no help! 
---
For me, this confirms my legendary deep pocketed metal armor is the best i can be outside of power armor. my DR is 450 at the moment with legendary effects.
---
Sweeet
---
Little Late but PERFECTLY BALANCED
---
That's a really good idea.  I like that a lot.  
---
It's happening about once an hour from what I've seen 
---
She returned a game because she didn't know how to do a single action?
---
...dont take this the wrong way, but... she knew google was a thing, right?
---
Just a heads up, if the sloth freezes in place, wait for it to become the meat pile. That will be lootable :)
---
yeah I got it too but it took like 15+ events lol.  It seems much more rare than the others.  I'm still wondering if there are any I haven't seen yet.
---
Didn’t know that... I dumped a few of them a while back dang... oh well...lol
---
Blue.....
---
You've obviously never made and scrapped a bazillion heavy combat armor to learn all the mods or run a shotgun build. 
---
Blue
---
I wanted to make a post mentioning how laggy it's been (probs due to 15+ people participating) but saw all the posts praising it so not sure if it's just my end.
---
Either way both times I done it it took at least 5 mins for enemies to actually appear, whilst I could tell other players were fighting them ai just couldn't see them. Same for the parade bots. Also the event takes ages to make active in my pipboy, along with constant stuttering. 
---
I saw another guy post that multiple people could claim the same workshop, but by doing so you all become a team and the more players who own it, the more mobs that attack it. That seems like a good idea  but players could claim it and ignore any attacks on it just to be a dick. So there's probably an idea there, but needs tweaked.
---
The Fasnacht parade is one of the easiest events to do (especially since everyone on the server goes to it like you just nuked the queen) I believe the highest level enemy is the legendary megasloth who is only level 31, not to mention you probably won’t even have a chance to shoot anything as the higher levels will just obliterate all enemies. No one would notice an extra level 14 tagging along 
---
It was pretty ridiculous, I agree. She was just getting into gaming and hadn’t thought to look it up.
---
Tell me she gave it another try later on right?
---
Years from now,  while we are sitting around the C.A.M.P. fire, we will remember. 
---
We will tell tales of the early days, when the wasteland was still wild. We will tell those who come after us of the Great Screw Wars...
---
Not to revel in the glory of combat, not to hold ourselves high; No.
---
We must tell them so that they may learn that such a war can never happen again. For the sake of humanity, it must never happen again. 
---
Seems like there’s a good amount of masks that are significantly more rare than the handful that everyone seems to be getting (owl, soldier, giant, witch).
---
Oh yeah. We’ve both completed it a few times since then.
---
Lots and lots of people show up for the event, so even if you're a low level, you'll be safe. Plus, the more players that participate, the better! Means we get a higher chance of the marchers all surviving and more of a chance for a mask :) it's a low level event, the highest level stuff I've seen spawn were level 10. You'd do just fine
---
He seems to hang out ALOT BY sinshine meadows. I take it whenever I can for a southwet base of operations and he generally shows up walking by at least once per session. 
---
If also like to see a freezer for the CAMP, so when we cook or find those rare items they don’t spoil. I mean c’mon, if I can build a fusion generator from scratch I ought to be able to fix up an old ice box. 
---
Good to hear, thank you! 
---
Does the Black Power Pistol do 30% more damage to The Man?
---
Don't feel too bad.  It's such a tedious process its almost not worth it :)
---
So I suspect there's a fair number of players out there that are like, "What's the big deal with this quest? I don't see the humor--it's just annoying and I don't get it."
---
You, my friend, live in a small town. You may not realize it, but that is a perk of living in a small town. Your 'city' of 200k is a small town. I know, because I have lived many a small town.
---
I currently live in one of the largest metro areas in the US, and this shit is for real. The DMV is one of the most loathed &amp; hated places to ever find yourself in. There is *always* a line and you must *always* have a number. The people that work there hate their existence more than you while you are waiting for your number to be called. You aren't 'the cool guy/gal, the nice one, the polite one, nor does anything you do matter. You are a number and will sit in your seat/stand until your number is called. J47...J47...
---
No one will tell you what paperwork you need for what you need to get done. Only at the counter will they tell you, then look down upon you for wasting their time. Sort of. They get paid by the hour, so it kind of matters, but it doesn't. They get paid by the hour, but don't want to talk to people like you all day.
---
Fortunately, most things can be done online, and I highly recommend doing so. In my state, if you fail to get your registration tags renewed before they expire, you can no longer do it online, you have to go to the DMV. All it took is one time. I then literally drove to a small town to get it done. I immediately learned to never ever let my registration lapse again. 
---
And that's why this quest is hilarious! If you only knew!
---
Because using the workshops to circumvent the slap system they put in place is definitely working as intended. The PVP dynamic for workshops wasn't meant to let you get ganked in the cranberry bog because someone payed 25 caps at your workshop in the forest. Or does that sound like it's working as intended to you?
---
Keep on keeping on friend. We need more players like you in this world.  26 yo old soul here (so I've been told).

I got the beret and the owl on my first run. I didn’t know they were rare. Which others are fairly rare?
---
This being kept updated?  Giant mask reward is a drop, also Fasnacht baret
---
Two of my accounts are banned again for no reason and with no email or warning. My newer created account is not. This feels like its a mistake or done by accident. 
---
There are 2 points to add a wire on those powered doors.  One is the obvious spot, the other is at the top center of the door.  
---
I spent a lot of time trying to set it up.    
---
To do a combo door:  
---
Power source to Door Switch Box (Blue, upper left)  
---
So, that makes it techncially the correct spelling. 
---
Just have to hope people show up properly geared to drain her. Unfortunately the casuals that show up for the fun don’t do enough damage to offset her difficulty increase for showing up. Last few times I’ve fought her have been with all 100-400 level players and we melt her pretty quick. 
---
NP
---
No but if the quest is active there's a button to locate it on the map when you hover over the quest
---
Yes they are seen 2 or 3 post in 10 mins saying they where reband i feel bad for them but then again  im not surprised 
---
Wow that must be a huge oversight.
---
&gt; I don't know what anyone under level 100 is doing there. They are not contributing. 
---
Me and a mate both level 54, first time the other night killed the SBQ with a few other high level players.
---
Sorry, didnt know we werent allowed to participate, should have checked with you first.
---
Shame, I’m on the Xbox. Otherwise I’d of done it for you mate.
---
I've been having this problem every time it updates. I rebuilt my database tonight, and that seems to have fixed it.
---
In the patch notes it only said:
---
* **Legendary Creatures:** Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
It didn't said it always drops a 3 stars legendary item if you killed a 3 stars legendary enemy
---
900 hours guy here. Getting the same message on both my accounts that got suspended. 
---
I feel like this is an accident or a mistake. Someone accidentally pressed the "ban them" button again. 
---
Plus is $45 for a year right now. Might be worth it.. 
---
Or you could just get PS Plus like the rest of us PS4 owners 
---
Always a level 35 1-star from what I've seen.  Not worth the effort for most people.
---
Masks that I haven’t seen people wearing include the Old Man Winter, Jester, Devil, Skull-lookin one that the Musician wears, Sun, Moon with crashed spaceship. Could be even more that I missed.
---
Ah. Wunderbar. I can not say i'm surprised it's a Fasnacht update item, given I hadn't seen it before this week and I first saw fellow dwellers wearing it in Helvetia. Danke, commentors. Enjoy Fasnacht, and Auf Weidersehen!
---
\-SirJamesGhost
---
28 here, just checking in. 
---
I was literally just looking for a post by you to see an update on your situation if you had been rebanned
---
I mentioned you in my videos covering the ban waves 
---
Hoping it’s not some sick joke by Bethesda or something
---
I'm not convinced anything other than owl, soldier, witch, giant, toothy and beret have dropped at all yet
---
I hope so. But the servers are still flaky and seem slower to load compared to pre patch.
---
PSN typically has a free trial of plus
---
I've seen a claim that diseased can be legendary without showing it. Yet I'm not sure I'v ever looted a legendary off of diseased enemy.
---
Yes he does. I got then yesterday
---
I got a Faschnet Beret. 
---
That it how it works.
---
You also spelled Grahm wrong :-(
---
Might be worth checking a look at this months PS+ games to see if any of those could tempt you into it
---
It's because it actually was a robot.
---
"Because using the workshops to circumvent the slap system they put in place is definitely working the way it was meant to."
---
You mean the workshops that outright tell you you're consenting to potential PvP before you claim them? Yeah, it's working exactly as intended.  Whether you're at the workshop or not is irrelevant if you're the owner and it's being stolen.
---
Works for me.  I didn't even have to craft it. I just picked up the old stove and placed it as the red stove.
---
The lag is the reason I keep failing, last night she was down to half health, I mysteriously died &amp; popped up somewhere close &amp; when I got back there all creatures were frozen &amp; I couldn't do any damage, so I left the world. 
---
I was trying out my BE 50 cal for the first time &amp; I like it :)
---
Lol damn phone typing crap shot mouth to finger poop shoot. 
---
Truly designed by an inept and/or malicious government...
---
With how often they re-introduce old bugs in newer patches, for whatever reason I feel like this was a mistake or done not on purpose. At least that's what I'm really really hoping. This is fucking insanity at this point.
---
Like I said, I'm not normally interested in online games. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
You’re right, that’s not the Merman.
---
That's a weak reason dude. 
---
yeah, that must suck
---
Thanks for the idea, but it looks like I already did the trial? Maybe back in the ps3 days? I don't even remember to be honest. 
---
They probably have not 
---
What was it?
---
Yup, confirmed by some comments in other threads by bethesda employees - it's an hour after the previous parade ended. So not hourly but near enough.
---
Like I said, I was already on the fence about this and thought it would be a low risk way to try the game. If you're not already a plus subscriber this is definitely another hurdle this game has had to overcome. That's all I was trying to say. 
---
There are a very few people who have managed to get the merman mask, which, after about 20 runs of the event I haven't gotten yet. This to me proves that there is some sort of rarity to some of the masks, which gives credence to the idea that there are more masks than people have gotten yet. But listening to IG voice chat sort of dampens my mood considering that absolutely no one has gotten the harlequin, devil or skull masks yet.
---
Pc users: Is this some poor people joke I’m too rich to understand?
---
I got a tequila sunrise plan and today he gives them sparsely though. I presume so people can't grind them out in a fortnight
---
Lol it’s not the game’s fault that you’re too cheap to get a subscription 
---
It only guarantee a legendary item drop when you killed a 1-3 stars legendary enemy in the last patch, it didn't said it will always drop a 3 stars legendary item when you killed 3 stars legendary enemy
---
Yes it does. Especially since you can say everything about a post on 3 or 4 words. I tried to ask about PA mods. And it flagged me for breaking rule 6. Had to message the mods about why. No where in rule 6 does it say that your tittle has to have x amount of length. 
---
Thats hawt, headless mistress lol.
---
They put limits on certain things like turrets. You may have stuff that exceeds a limited item. It’s not ideal, but you can likely turn the blueprint into individual parts and build it back. 
---
It starts itself automatically on a timer every hour.
---
I had this happen earlier. It fixed itself after I opened my Pipboy 
---
God, it kinda reminds me of people saying they couldn't use their power armor headlamp color mods because it was saying it was changed to atom shop headlamp. Did you try to submit a ticket, if its a bug they might eventually fix it. Because of stuff like Camden daily being broken its making me think random spawns aren't going drop those plans if they were deleted from the learned.
---
Weird?? I didn’t get any pop up in my 10 minutes of waiting around for a friend to join my server and trying to figure something out. Ended up getting the key and it was all chill. Sucks that there’s not a more obvious button
---
Try Hex
---
Easy just do ps+ trial on a new psn account for 15 days.
---
Sounds like a you problem lol. 
---
Even the robot employees sound like they hate their jobs, too.
---
Why yes it is -.o
---
We talking hour in real time? Server hops doesn’t work??
---
Ok, because I haven't seen any of the other masks. If you do see someone with one could someone show it in this post?
---
That's unfortunate. It's definitely worth a try if you make the leap.
---
Not really, I would bet my life that a vast majority of ps4/Xboxone owners subscribe for online play. Becuase most games that come out nowadays include multiplayer parts. 
---
I mean we get it. You are cheap. But why are you coming here to tell us that you didn’t try a game because of something that isn’t even related to it? Go complain to Sony for putting online play behind a pay gate. 
---
The problem here is that there are a literal tonne of games that you need it for. Even as a solo player there are benefits to being a plus subscriber. Free games every month as an example. So no, your excuse is still weak. If you have a problem with a fallout game that is an online only multiplayer, that's one thing. I can respect that. But you won't play it because you don't have or want plus. That's a very weak reason. 
---
She turned me into a ~~newt~~ gulper!
---
You should see that guy Smokeys group that posts earlier in the day. The queen melts like butter.
---
Had the same thing happen but jet pack and stealth boy on the same enclave vendor 
---
Seems to me that BoS combat armor is the best, if you combine DR + ER...
---
we got new excavator paint?
---
I hope its not going be atom shop item like the summer mask since 500 is so pricey.
---
I haven't heard anyone say they have gotten it yet. I've done it 7 times and only got 2 recipes and the one plans. 3 owl masks, old man and giant mask lol
---
If you never had the plans for the stove variant it might not work
---
I got it my first try
---
I’ve been keeping my eye out, I got duplicates of all four commons and not a single rare.
---
I think that's it! :( I need the plans
---
Damn
---
Plus like, you need so much boiled water. Holy heck. This particularly with the new booze update, I've literally made over a thousand waters in the last week. wtf. 
---
I get that this game is 99% grind, but at least make the rewards a little better or SOMETHING.
---
Usability Rant: No offense but this kind of thinking is exactly why it's hard to get people who aren't into games to play them even when we think they'd enjoy them. So many games now are designed to appeal to people who've played lots of games already and don't need things explained to them, it's just assumed that they'll know all this stuff that non-gamers wouldn't actually know. "Google" is only something you'd think to use if you had enough experience in Skyrim-type games to know that walking that slowly wasn't normal in a game like that. Games used to be broadly popular when you could pick up a controller with a direction pad and two buttons on it, but now those players are stuck playing crappy, Pavlovian feedback loop addiction mobile games instead, because the rest of gaming has left casual players behind. How hard would it have been to have the game recognize that this player clearly didn't understand encumbrance, and for it to pop up and explain what was going on and how to fix the problem? Trivial, really. "Wonder why you're walking so slowly? Hold X and we'll explain encumbrance" - We don't have to make games simpler to play, but we should be making them simpler to learn. Just my 2c.
---
I just went in for my first time and there were about 10 of us, I'd say 6 of us were putting up real damage, and the other 4 which were lower level were taking out the mobs.  It worked pretty well.
---
I too use a sneak build as well, but I really don't think you should count on those working.  Scorchbeasts have an insane ability to detect, I can be full sneak and chameleon mode active and if they fly above me they still detect me.  You need to go in with heavy weapons, AA/TSE weapons, or strong melee, with strong perks to match.  I'm not saying it's right or I agree with it, I'm just saying that's how it is right now.
---
A junk pile is good if you don't know what resource you are needing. It gives a variety of things.
---
Thats ... impressive. Dont worry tho, my storage is so full with all kinds of legendary items i save for the legendary vendor so maybe i can craft the effects that i want or stuff like that that i have to carry ***all*** my junk and ammo with me. The perks help, more than leaving it in the storage as the perks dont apply there. But im still hellishly slow.
---
Thankfully a bug helps out. XD When you leave the game while wearing the excavator armor then rejoin the server it adds the excavator armors bonus carry load ontop of the already existing one. Although this doubled effect turns back to normal once you leave the suit.
---
Unyielding with radicool and nerd rage are really effective, but you have to be around 20% hp so you are basically a one shot. If you can get unyielding with sentinel full set then you probably can survive way better.
---
Free states. I would pay all of my hard earned atoms for a gadsen flag at my camp
---
I have gotten quite a few plans and every "common" mask besides the beret that you can get. I just feel like of the 6 or 7 hours i played of it, im wasting my time if i didnt even get one of the "super rares".
---
So picky ;)
---
Just soooo you know it does say in the item info you need the plan for cooking stoves so the info is there. I think the plan is like 200 caps or something and I’ve seen it at train stations. 
---
The parade event does notify you. Just like the sbq. 
---
+karma
---
\*points in Nelson\*
---
HA-HA!
---
I'm beginning to think that they are mega rare. I've been playing since 3 almost non stop. 
---
Thanks, I haven't seen anything in the Atomic Shop require plans like that, I appreciate it!
---
I was under the impression Bethesda did their hotfix/patch forcing mule accounts to delete items they had in large ammonts. I used to trade heavily but nost of my inventory is self farmed as I have really good luck. I only had one character that I had to delete items "some nuka drinks a friend had given to me awhile back". I didn't have stacks of rare weapons or anything, some ammo and junk but not excessive ammounts. Since getting my account back I was playing with friends casually launching nukes and doing queen fights enjoying the game for what it is. Today I went to check out the Fasnacht Parade and couldn't login... Disappointing to say the least and hopefully they resovle this quickly. 
---
That would be bad but it's Bethesda so wouldn't blame them if they put them in the atom shop. 
---
Loved every minute of it... 
---
Level 200 and something here. My heart still does a little flip when I pass by my stash at the Whitesprings station.
---
Pro-Tip: always stash your junk. This game crashes a lot. You can take your junk out at almost any trading area, why carry it on you?
---
I second this. It is a single star. Not worth the time unless you are really low level. And I believe it being capes at like 35, that is the highest level legendary you can get. As for all other mobs, just generic loot, nothing special. 
---
Personally I wish they’d remove caps from pvp entirely.. The pay to play factor can be rough who those who cannot contend, and it regardless it drains them for a resource they need to support a variety of normal activities. It’s dumb that if you don’t have a big bag of caps to potentially lose you can’t go pvp too long unless you win, win ,win. I think it would be ideal if the whole pvp thing had nothing to do with caps outside of Bounties. 
---
You need to buy the road leathers, raider leathers, harness, or the long johns plan. Then I think you might need the treated mod before you can use resistant. It's not really a waste if you want to make some underarmor. I can make them, but someone made me a protected Vault underarmor. But I still make the Raiders underarmor for folks who don't have any. I'm hoping soon to be able to craft my enclave urban scout underarmor. 
---
50 years old. I believe my generation where the first to have video games. The first games where only at an arcade. The only home game was pong. Atari came later.
---
Apparently there are 2 different types of royal jelly. The one for the recipe can only be found in Helvetia and is an aid item, the royal jelly from honey beasts are junk items and do not count towards the recipe. 
---
Hell yeah borthor I'm super picky and have terrible priorities for a man in the post-apocalypse but hey it's a living~ ;}
---
Oh my god. The first time I came across someone else’s camp was when I played with a friend, and I said “Oh wow, you have a lot of junk. I won’t take any though!” And she goes “...that’s yours.”
---
Oh. 
---
I just recently found out I needed a shovel to complete a quest to bury some bones. I had a hell of a time finding one after having scrapped or ignored umpteen shovels in the past. So now I keep a shovel, just in case. 
---
 I mean the game literally says "you are carrying too much and are unable to run". I imagine one who doesn't know what that means would try to find out somehow, and google is most people's go-to platform for information. But sure, i'm in the wrong.
---
ESAD
---
I'm 100% with you. I've just dropped cooking altogether because of the chore it is looking for silt beans that aren't already harvested by another player. Since this brewing update I've been making all kinds of drinks like crazy because all I need for the most part is razorgrain and corn. 
---
I would also like it if they introduced some recipes that did certain effects much like the new drinks we have. I'd like to cook some kind of spicy death claw firecap steak that increases my melee damage or something XD. As it stands right now most just increase a special stat, Ap regen, heal more, or give xp bonus. I'd like a recipe I can go out of my way to cook so I could kill things faster or take less damage from them. 
---
Yup! Just saw the tv there a few minutes ago
---
The workshops are meant to be fought over. If you are just using it as a way to hunt people down on the other side of the map without them slapping back then you are absolutely abusing the system. Most people don't even take the workshop. They let it time out as soon as pvp is initiated. 
---
That's a damn good 2 cents
---
Check the roadmap they posted: April 9th, so in three weeks. 
---
jeez i just a sweep thru Watoga and was getting all my sneak attack bonuses (xb1).
---
 Know there’s a lot of countries/territories as part of the EU. But Hong Kong? ;)
---
Yes, at least level 1
---
Dont blame us when there were 16 people in that small town shooting everything! Its a low level event, we can't really throttle down to please everyone.
---
If green thumb gives you double harvest, having a machete equipped could add one more. 
---
I see a million of those at vendors now...
---
Hahahahaa, that's funny. 
---
Add a Witch mask as the quest rewards option.  I also got plans for Ribbon, Flag, Effigy Fire, and the Donut recipe. I have heard you can get a Sausage Recipe too.
---
Losing 50 aluminium or screws or springs hurts a lot.
---
They're still pretty good, especially with the right cards. Once Bethesda "balances" the bloody builds, they'll come back around.
---
Well, this is pretty much Mardi Gras But A Week Later Because Some People In Switzerland Are Weird... but they couldn't remember all that, so Fasnacht it is.
---
They can’t hurt you while you’re part of the event just fyi
---
I got it on my 5th time. 
---
It's not cheating or a bannable offense, but it can be abused. 
---
No. Fuck you buddy. I didnt do it!
---
No
---
Would you happen to know which ones? Or are you talking player vendors?
---
i hear you bro.  shit like that does happen but remember that sweet doesn't taste as sweet without the bitter my dude
---
If you haven't got the plans already from SBQ you can get them from Taggerdy's terminal in the top floor in the laser grid locked room. (I presume you've done the BoS quest already so you should just be able to take the elevator there &amp; leave.)
---
Then just go to any power armor station and build it. You'll need a ton of stuff tho: 90 Aluminum, 90 Screws, 84 Silver, 60 Ultracite, 60 Copper, 56 Oil, 45 Gear, 40 Rubber, 30 Springs, 17 Glass and 10 Nuclear Waste.
---
Happy Hunting!
---
I mean it’s only lasting a week so you can’t blame everybody for wanting to collect all the plans and new items. 
---
That woulda been awesome honestly 
---
They do. It’s per server. 
---
It happens when the server empties out. Then they shut it down for maintenance. It was announced that they would do this a couple of updates ago. It's likely not related to the event. It's just coincidence.
---
How did you know it wasn't validating?  I just re-downloaded the entire game, because chat crapped out.  Still dead, so I'm curious why you think validation missed something.
---
Sorry I meant top hats and suits for sale like someone made a ton of them and went around and sold them. I just saw them at Watoga and Charleston 
---
Unreal! I thought they did a hotfix/patch forcing overweight mules to destory their excessive items and everyone was unsuspended. The original email said it was a temporary suspension and we would be unsuspended in the near future etc. Wonder what's going on and if this was intentional or accidental.
---
Did you turn pacifist mode on?
---
Which I'm thankful for. Sunday is always the day wives look for knickknacks to blow money on. Delay Saturday to Sunday and ohhhhhhhh they're closed. 
---
Ohhhhhh i gotcha! 
---
One week - 26th of March.
---
You would imagine, but in this case you were wrong. And no need to take this personally, I'm just pointing out this is a common mistake when games are designed.
---
Thanks
---
Just dont worry about it. It literally makes no difference. DO NOT WORRY
---
Don’t hate the player, hate the game. Bethesda designed this game in this shoddy way. The nukashine quest belongs in a single player fallout game not in a multiplayer PvP one. Had to server hop a few times to even get the new stuff in the quest as people kept looting all the items in the frat house 
---
If you go away, never come back, and forget about the game.....may be the solution. 
---
Lots of other games to play.
---
That one seems one of the more rare ones.  Did the event 20+ times and haven't even seen someone wearing it.
---
Honestly, the first one was on me. I got baited hardcore lol, I knew I should’ve ignored him but I just didn’t 
---
Damn i want that sausage recipe lol.  I hope I can get it, I have off all thursday so I'll be server hopping all day xD
---
I could've been a bit more descriptive in my post. For example, I like doing horde events and it would be nice if I could get a notification when one pops up. Instead of scanning over the map. 
---
Lol what next, diseased protectrons shouldn't hang around WS golf club?
---
Some people will never be satisfied. 
---
On my last session I went to unload my stuff to harpers ferry vendor. There was a legendary and 3 star near the vendor. After them I drop some stuff for the vendor and advance towards church, but more enemies pop up. I realize another player has shown up, resetting the cell, so I rush back to the legendaries. Curiously the other is again 3 star. I think it's just RNG so it was good roll to get same legendary as 3 star enemy twice. I've never seen a 3 star to resurrect as 3 star, all times prior, a 3 star becomes 1 star.
---
The other player leaves quickly or just disapears, so after little waiting, I kill it alone. Then as I advance towards church again, I check the loot, I got two 2 star melee from them, both are SS, other is even bloodied miner gautlet, other is lesser anti-scorched sword. Aaand I get disconnected. I was thinking of staying there in area, to wait for more players to reset and to see if the 3 star enemy is stuck on being 3 star.
---
Should I be unhappy because I got kicked out of potentially a good server at great location? There was only two legendaries I found, without managing to get to the church, but if the other was fixed to 3 star? That would have been so great to farm. Or happy because particular the bloodied SS gauntlet should be worth some good gun in trading, as I don't do melee myself?
---
I am neither. I'm more intrested about these weird encounters where enemies aren't what they are supposed to be. I've seen super mutants that starts burning when they are low on health, and eventually explode, when they die. That's because no matter what the game displays, internally they were actually legendary robots. These protectrons on WS golf club are actually ghouls of some kind. Curiously some had brain bot tracks. Haven't seen protectrons elsewhere have that.
---
I don't see people making threads about looting legendaries off of non-legendaries. I don't see people as highly consistent. I see a great deal of people are biased. 
---
The bug you are complaining here, might not actually be that legendaries don't drop legendaries. It might be that the enemy wasn't actually the type, as it was displayed.
---
"Sometimes you just got to play by the rules of the game"
---
Your complaint today is that an endgame player dropped a nuke on the new quest site.
---
See, everyone that complains about griefers?  This guy, and likely several others, had their gameplay negatively affected by another player without any PvP or camp damage.  
---
ur not wrong lol
---
I'm just kiling them as i see them, and keeping good with salt on my perks, so I have like 30+ spares for the quest if they don't spawn
---
Royal jelly drops from honey beasts sometimes. And part of the fun is finding ingredients to use for certain recipes. There is t a Walmart in the wasteland, you have to search for your food. And as far as the spawn rates, the world is Supposed to feel barren and lifeless. Upping the spawn rate in like the toxic valley would not make sense. 
---
Staring down the barrel of 48 this year myself. 
---
Sounds like Bethesda griefed a few folks....
---
Oh god I can only imagine a game designed by you. Literally every single thing spelled out. Clippy popping up every other minute,"Hi, don't worry this is  a pop up screen, not part of the actual game! I know you've been playing for 20 hours but let me remind you about \*insert how to move forward here\*. Oh and I see you have a Sword! Tap A to use it! The A button is \*insert picture of most common types of keyboards\* If you don't know what a keyboard is, here's a useful guide on keyboards!"
---
Skyrim already suuuppppper explained literally every single action in the game. xD
---
its still a problem that needs to be addressed tho
---
It only shows one in my inventory, also I am ONLY getting purified water and another item no plans 20+ turnins 
---
I totally want to launch a nuke. Maybe I can time it for just after you collect all the honey
---
Had the inverse happen, seen a lone super mutant walking the road, thought he was Graham and ran over and died to his rocket launcher.
---
Shhheeeeeeriiiiiiiitttt
---
for today at least the events have been packed with enough people for level to not matter, most of the event is running around grabbbing things, only a small portion is combat, in which case the enemies seem to die very quickly and are lower level anyway. There is a legendary creature but again, there have been many people and it dies too fast if anything :P
---
I'm at 259hrs and never got a jet pack but did get an explosive single shot revolver. So I guess that's cool
---
It’s not really a complaint, I pretty much just wanted to share the story. I don’t even really care it’s not that big of a deal, it’s not like I’m blaming Bethesda for someone being a douchebag 
---
I just realized they might have done this to counter the robot parade server problems! People are literary farming the Rare Masks jumping servers over and over accordibg to one of my friends whos been farming the event all day! 
---
I'm just south of Alphas launch silo, on the cliff. We have garage doors that open the whole top floor and can watch the missiles go up and then touch down at prime. So good.
---
There are notes in the town where they are checking out a plane crash and stuff. Maybe they are in the open world somewhere?
---
I had this sort of, I kept re-joining event via the map until it popped up. 
---
Vertibird are controlled by man while Vertibot are controlled by AI, they just looks same in Fallout 4 and 76, in Watoga you can see a crashed Vertibird owned by BoS.
---
I always thought that would be a nice addition. Like if you have a shish shishkabob then it has a chance to instantly cook the meat you gather from animals, or a drill makes scrapping more productive, as long as you carry the items, or use em.
---
It’s one of those items in an annoying category- ‘common when you don’t need it, rare when you want to farm it’
---
I thought yes, but it wasnt showing for me just now however I noticed a lot of people in the area, so i teleported there and then it showed up.  Maybe just server latency though.
---
I’ve gotten two so far. 
---
Is it normal to turn 20 or more in and still not get any paint?
---
That is correct.
---
One of you MFs started duping again because the servers were rock solid until the so called unban.
---
Guess they had to lock the cheaters back out again.
---
A guy complained tonight about attempting to complete the parade when the area was nuked.  Shit like that is going to happen forever on PvE servers, is an intended mechanic of the game, yet causes players no small amount of grief.
---
Screws, springs and ballistic fiber. Ever died with a couple bulk ballistic fiber? You get back to your junk pretty quick and learn never to do that again.
---
So, is it 901 hours guy now?
---
Ehh, they have choices, including running away on the same server.
---
I have one of those... I've only had it for a single Queen fight, but it's literally the only fight I actually felt like I was making tangible difference. Maybe it was just luck of the draw, but it seemed like she landed whenever I got a decent run on her with it. Best Queen fight I've ever been in so far.
---
I feel like I saw another thread about this earlier, so it's probably not just you. 
---
Helvetia for Fasmacht and every train station will have a poster regarding a party for the beer brewing stuff
---
I have thought the idea of a no contest for workshops for those in pacifist mode would be a great solution to this. Additionally there could be an option for the attacker if there is a no contest to decline taking the workshop.
---
Bruh you serious??
---
First off during the ban wave there were countless people that didn’t get banned and kept duping the WHOLE time period of the last month, I doubt any unbanned duper’s would start it up again and anyone who got accidentally banned definitely did t start duping. 
---
Also the lag is with the parade as so many people are in one area shooting shit 🤪
---
Happened to me yesterday, too. Once I equipped a new weapon I got unstuck.
---
Not at the moment. Every damn person on the server is there every time. Ya really just need to enter the area and everyone else will kill everything and complete it. I had no idea what was going on so I just hung out and watched the massacre unfold And got the rewards. Honestly dumb stuff I won't use. I don't care to decorate my camp and don't really care about outfits. So it's pretty pointless for me after three events. I won't use any of it and didn't get my xp weapons or armor. 
---
Thx amigo 
---
We went through what 7-8 of those guys today alone XD
---
you can add Fasnacht Sausage to the list
---
that's why you use porta johns as jail cells. Most people didn't know you could lock them, idk about now though.
---
Praise the RNG. 
---
It's sold at one of the Responder train stations... I want to say the one in Toxic Valley, but I could be wrong.
---
just found two in one visit (one upstairs in the right bedroom &amp; one in the initiate room in the basement) so thanks for the heads up
---
53 here, hubby 54 and we play all weekend. Of course no household drudgery gets done but we are having great FUN! I'd join the 76 AARP in a heartbeat😉
---
She's beatable. I used to think that as well but the last three times have been successful. A guy on here launched like 14 nukes on her today and was a baller every time. So yeah it's possible. Very possible. 
---
Sometimes * mobs do not drop * lot.  Sometimes non* mobs drop * loot.  Its a wash as far as I am concerned.  
---
The Giant mask is the Merman mask. It even has gills.
---
Anywhere it'll let you. And if you decide you don't like that spot, or have found one you like more just move it! Changing camp spots is fun, imo. 
---
I have.  Usually surprised that they have the legendary items.  "I didn't see any Legendary names?"
---
That's the guy I was talking about. What a guy. I think they did it like 14 times today.  Of course I was at work 
---
Take the Poseidon energy plant and i think industrial farm as both have cement machines i think
---
After having my base nuked twice near white spring I learned to keep my base as far away from there as possible.
---
Just move your camp and everything will be rebuilt 
---
oh that spoiled meat has value now...
---
The giant mask and the so-called merman mask are one and the same. It’s labelled “Giant Mask”, but it has gills, and the Master of Ceremonies even makes a joke about “looking green around the gills”.
---
White springs always has one. In one of the cabins in the shower. 
---
I wish I could be so grossly incandescent.
---
I really hope they extend the no build zone, buuuut... there's always nukes.
---
Kk: online for the rest of the night and tomorrow. GT:Rocky Two milli
---
It's more of a "way of life"
---
Them having to run away is what makes it griefing and not pvp.
---
By contrast I get griefed at least once a play session now. The experience varies a lot I think depending on what you're doing.
---
I've already had one parade ruined by it.
---
I paid to go to three hoarde events only to find nothing there. The event seems to end the instant I show up. I just quit trying to do them after that.
---
Yep they most certainly stack. I'm at +30 strength. 
---
You know you can get a free trial for PS plus right?
---
Every time I see those stashes in the responder stations, I think to myself "sweet, free stuff". Technically, I'm right because it is mine in the first place.
---
From what I understand they must be selected in order to ferment at the faster rate. If they are unselected and not “displayed” they will ferment at the same rate as if it was in your stash or inventory. 
---
Server hops miiiight work but because it's from the end of the previous event (which would vary depending on how long it took people) you'd struggle right now since most of them are running at pretty similar times. It'll probably get more staggered as the week goes on.
---
&gt; Had to server hop a few times to even get the new stuff in the quest as people kept looting all the items in the frat house.
---
There is nothing in the frat house that is required for the quest that other players can take from you.
---
You just look like the nosy neighbor lady who disapproves of everyone and everything. 
---
PC, no dailies since last patch. We with team today and other member got the daily chow-line quest but it did not even show up that he had the quest on my screen.
---
I didn’t say it was required. They added the vault tec jacket and I had to server hop to get it. 
---
        Quest Started 
---
BGS: Don't F***ing Move
---
"HAHAHA SUCKER! ALL THAT SWEET JUNK IN THIS STASH IS MINE! Now just to haul it back across the map."
---
Quilty of doing that in the BETA the first time I played. So funny that I felt dumb as well
---
Ok. Little confusing with the text in the fermenter but that makes sense. I mean, I WISH I could display it but, I can deal.
---
Make sure to take Radicool :)
---
I only have 411lbs, but I'm only level 12. :-)
---
The enclave in the military wing always has tech data. Search the desks. 
---
20 here, pretty much every word I say is fuck
---
I think technically that's swearing offline.
---
Can confirm, definitely works. I got in 2 within 20 minutes (back half of the first, beginning of second)
---
Possible a future feature or maybe just poorly worded. 
---
BTW. No matter how many I pick up it only shows I have 1 until I use it. 
---
It wasn't his first time going there though, was it? Also, has he done Biv yet, and gotten dailies there?
---
Thats why i hate doing stuff with others and why i have trust issues online
---
0101100101. That’s just Gibberish... 1010011010!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! 
---
That sucks but I’ve find the parade 6 times and everything went fine each time 
---
I've literally never found a drill. Plenty of wooden armor though.
---
The ones that come around my own personal camp and cause shit, those are the ones i make mine for. Usually the same ones going around servers being vile players to everyone. Oddly enough they usually have nice camps. Fusion generators, arches, all the fancy stuff. To top it off the trolls like camping together. Depending on how bad you behaved will determine how many orbitals i toss in your door and around your property.
---
Got lucky and just got it and the sausage, don't think I've ever seen razorgrain flour though
---
What are you playing on? 
---
They make it hard enough with the mutant suiciders. 
---
PC
---
I had to melee to get free
---
I got better...
---
Concrete is easy. Gnomes 
---
Also, there are 6 bags of concrete at Poseidon.
---
Around Emmit Mountain Disposal Site. I think just west of it and north of the white springs train station. There is a cabin / camp up there that always has 3 scorpions. Sometimes it's bears or bees but always 3 of them. 
---
I put a pressure pad attached to a decontamination arch inside. So that when ever the door is activated the arch fires and I clear my dads as I enter or leave. 
---
Power to the switch on the back of the door to power the keypad. Then power to the pressure plate - decontamination arch - the door frame. That way I do not need to enter a code to leave only enter. 
---
It is weird how they set the door up. 
---
Well heck, if you don't mind helping out a random xboxer, I haven't been able to launch my first nuke yet. Maintaining my no-PA stealth build makes it just a tad too difficult to get through the silo solo. I died three times trying before deciding I'm just going to need a little backup. LOL
---
34 here. I hope to be like you if I get to be 65 :)
---
That is hilarious
---
Hilarious situation. The banter made it even better lmao. Good seeing everyone just having a good time.
---
"That was one weird NPC" had me in stitches.
---
So you go to one, if the mobs aren't the hoard enemies you'll get a message saying "This isn't the source" or something to that effect. If you happen upon the source just clear it out.. If the event doesn't complete just go investigate the other two highlighted areas until you see "This isn't the source" and return  to the last spot again, the boss should spawn in.
---
Are your parents Amish?  Jeez. 
---
You just walk around the objective area until you get a notification. Sometimes you have to go on top of buildings in the area too. 
---
As well as swearing at inanimate objects. 
---
Take a look at the map before you dip out. Find a few randoms, look on your Recently met players tab on xbox or ps4. You dont even need to message them, just go to profile, join game and bam. You're back on their server. 
---
I've gotten *three* Witch masks and one Owl. Yeesh.
---
Damnnnn when’s that mixtape drop?
---
Thanks but what am I doing? Just finding scorched to kill?
---
Someone did a test a while back when Beth nerfed the two-shot and iirc the Anti-Armor does _slightly_ more damage Two Shot (for now, post nerf). Reason being (iirc) that the two shot does 125% damage compared to bare bones and the AA ignores 30% of the armor making it effectively 130% damage of base. So I myself (and this is not apples to apples) prefer my anti-armor lever rifle as my walkabout weapon but I've got a Two Shot Gauss I'm keeping in storgae just in case Beth ever de-nerfs the two shots.
---
This is stupid you cannot ban someone for getting a duped weapon it’s not fair. I’m level 95 and decided to play your mess of a game and stumbled upon some people I wanted to trade with they had these weapons and gave me all of them. If you are going to ban us that’s stupid remove the items from the game. Your customer support is awful and lacks the support. So I want to be unbanned to play your game and spend money on it okay. Good luck fixing this mess and you need to use a new engine for es6 that’s all i want thought I liked Bethesda changed my mind you are the most untrustworthy, shady game company I have seen in a long time. 
---
Either your connection or your hardware. I've only done four but they've all had 15-20 people and the performance was surprisingly flawless. I expected frame drops or stuttering but there was none.
---
We have workshops. That is their point. I spent some time modeling at a power plant and got 10 full cores. I'm set for a while.
---
Wait actually? Thatd be so nice if I didnt have to go through all of that again lmao
---
I was there for 3 or 4 of them. Had a blast and we killed her every time. 
---
Ah. Thanks 
---
Did they drop it or place it and keep picking it back up and placing it again? Seems like if they dropped it you could just hop in and move it. I haven’t had this happen in the 5 times I’ve done it tho so idk how buggy it would make it. 
---
That’s where you get everyone nearby to 
---
I just wish cooking complex food payed off with better buffs. As of now most dishes are only marginally better than just roasted meat. Something that requires a lot of prep should reward you with exceptional buffs (imagine some meat medley that requires like 5 different creature meats and various vegetables but gave you +10 strength). It would also help to finally get a fridge so said food doesn't just go bad an hour later.
---
You have to either dismember it or wait til it turns to a meat pile.
---
I would be down for that. I don't like to play pvp but if you came up and requested I might try. 
---
Preach it brother!
---
If she survives the Nuke, she's a witch!
---
If she dies, she's innocent!
---
i had 600 lbs forever.
---
Then they raised the limit to 800 and I was so happy for awhile.
---
That was a glorious 25 minutes.
---
If you’re talking about the atomic shop paint job for the excavator PA, then just to lyk you can’t paint other people’s armor with it. 
---
I feel your comment about this event being geared mostly towards low levels is wrong. It is for everyone. It just happens the town where it takes place is in the forest. As for onshotting the ONE star sloth, well if you are going to moan about missing a one star legendary I don’t know what to say. It is just like low levels going to the SBQ event and increasing the difficulty while not really providing any help. Would you have rather them put the event in the mire? So only high levels could do it? 
---
This is why I’m still on this subreddit tbh 
---
Yeah your looking for the boss enemy of whatever the hoard event is. Once you kill it you complete the event most of the time it’s a legendary 
---
So say I craft fermentable bourbon. When it reaches 0 condition will it be "fresh bourbon"? That's what the quest calls for. Thanks for the help
---
Love to hear from all of the other older players. I am 57 and have the same commo problems. 
---
certain animals will stay like that even after you tame them wolf, deathclaw , sloth,...to fix this just pacify your tame then logout it will remain passive forever after that
---
Oh! So basically all those different areas on the map there's a chance to find the boss, and if you find the right area you can fight them correct?
---
Boylent Green
---
Hah!
---
You may be getting an invite from Spriggitt, once I'm up and out of this migraine fog. LOL :)
---
A boss should spawn in, usually a three star mob. It'll eventually show up on your compass, but you might need to investigate all three areas to get it to spawn.
---
Where is the mothman mask? :(
---
Bethesda stated that some of the masked are very rare when they talked about the event. 
---
I'm not selling  just think it looks cool. I should of specified. Sorry
---
He was dropping approximately 8 different chassis trapping the robots. He put 5 around one of them boxing it in. In area chat he was gloating about stopping the robots. the narrow bridge was the worst because you can't use collision to help move the robot around the obstacles. This players character was lvl 238 if I remember correctly. 
---
Apparently people are nuking the area as well. Beth needs to make this area a safe zone like the forest for the duration of the event. 
---
I thought you have to friend them and have them accept to join?
---
Great post! As a 49 year old wanderer, I think that multiple generations are enjoying this game shows its strength!
---
Is it called jester?  I got a toothy, soldier and witch.
---
Because the +100 you’re getting is a bug and you shouldn’t have it 
---
Example: Scorched horde in the forest. 
---
4 spots pop up. It's always Morgantown HS.  You can search the other places but there probably won't be any scorched.  When you go to the high school scorched will be there, kill them,  then it will say kill the alpha and a new marker will show up saying to enter the high school.  Inside there will be more scorched,  you are looking for a legendary one.  Kill him,  event complete. 
---
Sometimes i get generous, helpful i guess. I'll find some little guys on the map, dump all my plans. Sometimes they ask for some help. Sometimes people ask for a whitespring run or help launching a nuke. So i make a few dozen molotovs for them. Just make sure you smack them with ANYTHING. A automatic 38 pipe rifle is all they need. Spray and pray!
---
There are different enemy types for the horde events. Depending on the enemy you can make a pretty good guess at where they are instead of searching all the objectives. Say it's a Super Mutant horde and one of the circles are over West Tek chances are the boss will be there since it's always super mutants that spawn there. 
---
Unfortunately the majority of the players taking advantage of the event were below level 40 so slap damage wasn't going to make a difference.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Correct each area will have some enemies not always the right enemy type and sometimes the right enemy but not the boss enemy.  You need to find the enemy type of the hoard and kill the boss enemy of that type I think once you find it it marks it with a pip it will have a crown and potentially be an alpha/ legendary 
---
Most of mine go towards Whitesprings turret towers. I have all my PVE gear and am pretty close to a full set of assassins/cav gear and not as inclined to PVP so I don't really care about getting a bounty torching toxic players camps. I just hop servers and let the nearest person chilling collect.
---
Does it start if people are in Helvetia?
---
Same here, Xbox too...
---
Thank you. 
---
It cannot be completed unless you already have intestines on you as the small animals that drop intestines during the event won’t show in the nuke zone, did not finish it due to this.
---
Ok I‘ll try that. Thanks!
---
I just got the bonfire 20 minutes ago after my 4th event. 
---
Looks like he didn’t even make it to my camp anyways
---
Ahhhh thanks!! Worth checking... voice chat has been really spotty
---
Lucky!!!
---
I look for people like you, you’re the funniest type of person to kill.
---
Whitepsrings turret towers really grind my gears. Especially when I'm the one that launched the damn nuke.
---
My friends wife plays with us sometimes, she asked why they made me mad. I said its the type of person that does it that makes me mad. Picture having 5 people at work plus you, you grab 6 donuts on the way in. That person is the one who takes 2 donuts and screws someone out of theirs. Don't be the 2 donut person.
---
No problem, personally I don’t do them. The enemies are too low level to offer good loot.  Making it a waste of caps to fast travel. There are bette events to do tha are more fun and rewarding. 
---
I want it but it’s too similar to the blackbird paint I have so I’m waiting on something epic, I’m stingy with those atoms lol. Cool stuff tho I’m on XB1 or I’d come take a look at the shop.
---
well is the budget still missing? just give it a bit go do something else he will make it
---
Bro you ever have a nuke stolen??
---
Nuke only half the town?
---
I think it's kind of crappy how Bethesda is "solving" the issue by making PvP servers. That's backwards. There should be PvE servers, where you cannot damage each other, and instead work together to survive. 
---
I used to do the same thing with workshops, build them up really nice for whoever got it after I was done with it. It let me really get into building, without having to rebuild my camp all the time. Which is my favorite part of Fallout 4 and 76. I'd have a lot of fun with it. But now I don't touch workshops because I know without fail some asshat is going to PvP me. They don't even want the workshops they just want to be tiny dick loser assholes picking on lower level characters. "I'm just roll playing a Raider.", no you're a psychopath.  If it was REAL RP you'd not over power yourself and only attack people you think can't fight back. 
---
I never really get killed. I just go on about my business. You're the funniest type of person to ignore while they pointlessly seek validation. 
---
sometimes it takes up to an hour for my tames to show up
---
You like stealth boys? There is one inside pleasant valley, but watch out there may be a guy with a Tesla in there.
---
Shalulushhhhh🤫
---
Have an upvote for being awesome!
---
Makes for some great load screen photos i tell ya
---
On top of the cabinet, across from where you turn in technical data.
---
You sound like you get pretty mad easily.
---
Ran the event about a dozen times, keep getting the same 4 masks: owl, giant, toothy, with. Have multiple of each.
---
Friend got the beret, only one I've seen
---
Its prob just easier to farm the intestines from other areas before the event starts
---
ballistic fiber does not bulk.
---
Nah. My group just ignore your kind is all.
---
I could only find violet flux stuff in the popular bog spot, I was disappointed. Perhaps looking in the wrong place? Byt  Whitesprings is very nice and easy to grab. LOTS of yellow (neon?) flux plants all over the place, a good amount of cobalt, and whatever the green one was.. it even had ultracite ore. 
---
I god every hour. Just wait.
---
If you trade with someone from reddit look through their history, it all depends on the person, ive traded all types of armor thats worth anything from 10-20k caps and theyve always gone well
---
Thanks for the insight. Greatly appreciated.
---
yeah it sucks to lose junk like springs, screws, ballistic fiber. but on the other hand since you don't lose any weapons or other gear it's not as bad as it could be lol
---
Yeah. Hopefully  they come out with more soon. I'm just happy not to be safety yellow anymore.
---
Wow that really sucks sounds like a real toxic player. I’d be alright with them making it a no nuke zone but honestly I feel like they’d mess it up somehow and make other areas un-nukable.
---
Hopefully you don’t run into that person again as I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with the parade thus far, except for the mega sloth being unlootable that one time..
---
Okay, I also figured out if I punch it’ll break me out of it. Also just hit a bug with the event where it wouldn’t continue for some reason even though the cooler had 12/12 intestines it kept the marker on it... 
---
I actually have a low level player that I've dumped tons of plans on so I can build workshops without getting attacked by PVPers. Nobody is going to try to farm 25 caps from some newbie at the red rocket megastop when they could rip 300 caps off the guy at the ammo factory.
---
I've actually noticed that most of the workshops go unclaimed these days, aside from the powerplants for fusion cores.
---
If you log out of the game in you Excavator PA, the next time you log in the 100 lbs bonus is doubled.  
---
Exiting the PA and entering it again resets the bug.  
---
Avid collector of shiny things and clothes, may I ask, What's dress is this?
---
There's a reliable stealth boy in the locked room on the second floor (technically third floor) of the Watoga EMS building. It's on the bottom shelf on the rack next to the mirror.
---
I may update this post as I find more. I believe there's also a stealth boy or 2 on the top floor of Fort Defiance. One in the locked supply closet and another in the power armor crafting room but I'll have to double check. 
---
It really is a shame they did not include an offer/trade function. Best advice. Attach a cap value to it, then have them offer the same amount so it essentially equals out. Then you at least walk away with something if they decide not to hold up those end of the bargain. 
---
If either party is at max caps, I don’t think this would work. 
---
I was reading this post while server hopping and landed in a nuked helvetia and died :(
---
In retrospect I’d hope my question doesn’t matter. Sorry to hear that and hope it’s a string of bad luck. For what it’s worth I’m on PS4.
---
Then why exactly are you complaining if you ignore people? Someone obviously hurt you where you had to come rant about bloodied builds 
---
Even worse when they use vats and basically teleport to you to 1shot you 
---
Nope, you dont. Not on xbox at least. As long as you're online and you can remember a few that were on that server 5 minutes ago (i snap a quick pic of the recent tab in the teams/recent player), you can go to their profile and join. Same way you could message or invite to chat.
---
Thats how i join people on here looking for serums or trades, carrys or whatever. I dont friend everyone. Now go grief the griefers!
---
It seems like when the sloth is killed before he's able to mutate is when you aren't able to search him from my experience
---
Good point. I was specifically talking about right at the end of the event where everyone is chilling. I got  robbed bad, lol. At least it was just a toothy. 
---
I might have to check out r/fo76market after this event though. 
---
Technically special is the politically correct term for kids like that. They’re normal people just like you and me... kinda
---
You ran with the hoopleheads?
---
The red stove and other items in the atom shop are basically skins or paint jobs. You have to know the plan before to have it available to place.
---
It seems like this sort of stuff happens much less frequently on PC. I can't explain why.
---
Had a player I let into my CAMP that proceeded to blow up my fusion generator when I was looking and take off.  I fast travelled ahead and killed him and got the bounty. As I'm looking through his stuff he has almost exactly 600lbs.
---
  Figured out he probably took everything out of my stash box, not realizing it was his stuff.
---
I have a bloodied build. It's just annoying to see kids acting like they are gods because of it. It would be like someone running around bragging that they know how to write... it's like "ok dude, nobody cares."
---
I’ll take vanguard and unyielding wood armor 
---
I think there’s two or three stealthboys in a box in a destroyed school on top of tanagra town
---
Kill them and be in your way then lol, they fall in one hit.
---
You still need the cooking stove plan in order to use the re-skin to red
---
Lol
---
True
---
I’ve gotten it twice now. 7 runs or so.
---
Then Just go to the general area and see if it starts. The first time I did it, it did not activate till I crossed the bridge. 
---
Duping sucks, that’s all I’ve really got to say.
---
Maybe a r/wooosh moment but Im almost certain no one else but you can access your fermenter/stash box but you.
---
He is counting against my budget and it was almost an hour or so. I server hopped hoping he made it home. 
---
Yup. 1400 Atoms.
---
Man, well RNG has never been on my side aha, guess ill just keep going until i get it
---
I just hope enough people reported him so NO ONE had to deal with him.
---
Probably that Jester one. Haven’t seen anyone wear that yet unless we can’t even get that one which I doubt 
---
Camden Park inside roller coaster raider area on top of case on left as you go in before Ragstags. 
---
lol right now there are literally 2 users, one over level 200, following me around Biv's stabbing me to no effect. You'd think they'd get bored, but no. 
---
I ran about 4 down there today. Insanity! That boy knows how to throw a Queen party! 
---
You can get it bulk from vendors.
---
........and now you have told every child how to do it.
---
With the amount of players in one area I can see why it would. I didnt get disconnected though. For me nothing was loading in. It would take 6 min sometimes for the balloons to show up. 
---
I got a mask and a  beret and no recipes on my first 3 runs and I’m kind of annoyed lol
---
I keep mine at 790+
---
I got it but I have done at least 20 events now
---
In West-Tek where the boss enemy spawns. Kinda hard to describe but it’s upstairs by the terminal you use to unlock another door in the building. Also one of the busses in Watoga spawns one 
---
Yes that too. Definitely experienced that. 
---
They went back to the *overseer's camp* to store things. Probably a safe bet they did so because they had yet to make their first camp. So 500lbs sounds about right for before you exit flatwoods...
---
(This is the internet, so in place of vocal and body language cues, /s )
---
A couple runs she was dead in less than 7 minutes
---
Welcome!!!  Well...eventually....😀
---
I get the harassment part, but how is this an exploit? 
---
Youtube
---
Yrah but I guess it'd be more profitable to get all of them for 300 Atoms. I've already spent 450 Atoms on 3 of them. Oh well, they're free Atoms.
---
Sphinxy, i saw you down there!
---
I would definitely recommend being level 2.  The guy who said level 1 is not telling the truth!
---
Don’t worry, the last two times I tried it they ignored the appointment line for so long I was late to my appointment. The DMV heeds not “technology.”
---
Wish I wasn't at work
---
Heh... We'll try searching the ice box outside of the golf club. I've dumped more then one single star Unyeilding wooden armor in there.
---
Or for those of us who always played the easier modes on other Fallout games...if Beth can make the harder levels on 76 for peeps, WHY can't they make an EASY MODE for those of us who are alone and don't like all the constant killing and being attacked? Some of us are too "afraid" to wander far and explore and do quests because we're not that good of players...but we'd like to enjoy the whole game too. 
---
Someone needs to potshot you off your high horse. Good grief. 
---
That's weird. No sloth spawned for our group. Or maybe it did and it was killed even before I saw it.
---
Exploiting game mechanics btonprevent completion of an event. It's a stretch I know, but it can be "rules lawyered"
---
Man I thought there was a huge text prompt that said "Workshops are PvP events" When you go to capture them, thus doing so you're accepting that you're ready for PvP by owning one.
---
I'll he running around looking like an idiot while everyone else does all the quest. Even if I'm on the same server for awhile and the quest starts itll do the same thing 
---
He really does. I was just glad I was able to get in on some of it.
---
It is grindy for sure. Not much luck on the masks. So there’s balance in the RNG force.
---
Bethesda already announced the ones for the atom shop.  There is the one being offered now and then another one the last half of the week. 
---
You can only have 1 at a time now. 
---
The military wing is the best so far as I know. As long as you don't loot all the desks and only take one TD out each time, you can server hop each time and respawn the desks. I've done like 10 TD in play session from there. 
---
"Good" rewards are still seemingly super rare. 
---
As well as everyone to report it and bring it to Bethesda attention. There are more nice players than toxic ones, the toxic just stand out more.
---
This right here. Spending precious caps on the bulks and forgetting you had them. Then finding out you have them far from a stash or your camp. 
---
Maybe that's it. I remember frantically trying to get someone to accept a friend request when I was trying to transfer some stuff between two characters on the computer when I assumed I could just join from recent but the option didn't come up. Maybe it is platform specific? I play mostly on Xbox these days so I'll check next time I'm on. If so I'm going to start getting payback more often.
---
:::Paris Hilton Voice:::
---
That’s hot!
---
I/m guessing some of those will release as rare drops over the next few days.  They probably want to stretch it out unless they are so rare no one is getting them.
---
I will give you that. Not what I would think of when I hear exploit, but I can get down with that explanation. Lol. 
---
He does it quite frequently. Its hard to get on servers with them though. Everyone is great, everyone revives each other if needed, team or not. Its amazing watching almost everyone on a server in 1 spot just murdering her over and over.
---
Like my brother used to say when he was a kid, "Deserves you right." LOL Really though, there were a couple times early on when it took me a second to realize I was taking items from my own stash and not the container next to it. (Looking at you, Flatwoods.)
---
I’ve done this. So glad I’m not the only one! 😆
---
And we're discussing ways to remove the PvP event and still have a workshop. The only people pissed off that we would be having this discussion are people who use workshops as a means to engage in pvp with people who clearly don't want to PvP. 
---
Pleasant valley Ski Resort.
---
When you enter the main building (The Vendor Building) front of you there a bar counter then behind a Stealth Boy always spawn on the left machine trail.
---
With the quest only lasting a week they may need more time to do more stuff with It. I agree though it's taking 15min or less now to finish it if the server is good. It's a start though in the right direction adding something new to the game. 
---
I know the feeling, I've bought some stuff that went on sale later. I just picked up the pack today. Until then I hadn't spent any atoms on the poses, I mostly would just buy camp items. It is nice seeing packs and new items that aren't super expensive. 
---
Ok good. I leave stuff at camp unlocked for people. I just didn’t want my vintage nukashine to go missing. As long as fermenter is connected to stash box....
---
Thanks.
---
Here's my loot (from 3 successful runs): Toothy Man Mask, Soldier Mask, Beret (it's not a mask, it's a hat), Sausage Recipe.
---
I have had the issue where budget does not go down with deleting but completely shutting down to game and restarting fixes it.  I am on PC though and it looks like you are on PS4.
---
I think feeling like Skyrim of all games needs to be made more casual is like, just don't play games at all, watch movies. If you need to be told every single thing multiple times, I can't help but not want you to ruin games for everyone else. Carry weight is explained in game. If that's not enough, and someone thinks there should be pop ups, pop ups!, every time you're over encumbered? omg no come on. 
---
High horse not even included.
---
It definitely works on xbox. Unless they players you remember are listed as SHOW OFFLINE. Then you can't.  Normal ones are fast and easy. 
---
Hope i didn't just open pandoras box with that though...
---
I think I’ve seen the plans at the Whitespring interiors vendor.
---
YUP. That's a real issue I'm not sure they fully considered. Also the impact on accessibility - unlike prior FPS Fallouts where VATS would slow the game down, letting people with significant reflex/motor challenges compensate, playing at full speed all the time in FO76 can be too twitchy for a lot of players with those kinds of considerations.
---
Did you finish any of them already? There might be a few more somewhere in there for weapons you use and enemies you kill on a regular basis
---
That's not griefing that's legitimate PvP. 
---
Yeah I leave my camp open to all comers, well I did till the booze took over now I don't have a camp so much as a booze farm and a bed, but the fermenter is Stash based and stash is character locked.
---
Things even close to the blast zone are still affected. Thus no critters will spawn if the blast zone is too close.
---
There's one next to a cap stash on the climber's roof in Morgantown. You jump from the parking garage next to the Christmas house to the fire escape on the building next to it, shimmy out a plank then jump across to a billboard and he's at the pinnacle of the roof.
---
thats fine if he is still counting toward budget then he's not dead try going far away from your base then logging out then log in and warp back see if that helps...( i tame alot)
---
i thought pa had a carry weight bonus. it should if it doesn't. 
---
Run, Bender!!!!!!
---
10 people doing slap damage should take out someone quickly though.
---
YouTube is still a great resource. But avoid the ranting ones (anything by Juicehead)  and the basic gameplay or lore ones (Oxhorn) And any that are more than 3 months old. 
---
Rifle Gaming is great. 
---
Captain Noob is entertaining but not really for new players.

It’s an open world game. You can pretty much do whatever you like. I’m almost level 200 and still feel like I’m starting the game. Have fun. 
---
Beret looks cute with my BOS bomber jacket. 💖
---
42 here
---
I'm actually dealing with the dmv right now and I've called three separate numbers and they all said "someone will call you before the end of the day."  VA DMV was quick to respond to me and help but FL DMV...fuck helping you, let's redirect you to ten different numbers and never call you.  They're trying to charge me an illegal fine for nothing to do with the state of Florida that I'm going to take to court after.  Just goes to show you how much they care. 
---
Everyone can do events.  But certain events are quite obviously geared for lower levels based on their complexity, and challenge.  Just as there are events that are geared towards higher leveled players.  Fasnacht is clearly not geared towards higher leveled players based on the enemies faced, and the simplicity of the event.
---
What if you only nuke half of the town?
---
Haha, I guess we'll see. Thanks for the tip!
---
Is the parade thing active? Does it show up as event for everyone, or do you need to activate it somehow? I didn't see it yesterday evening when I was playing, I started to do the nuka shine quest but didn't yet drink the first bottle, as I wanted to do my vendor run first.(and then got sidetracked with shit and stuff, Watoga bots are still waiting with their 200 caps)
---
Have fun with the game. I'm quite younger, but I've been a pensioner for quite some time now, so my life is far more similiar to people of 60+, than of anyone elses, except I don't have typical health problems assosiated with high age. I don't like to consider myself middle aged before Im 40, but as I'm fairly close, I guess I technically am. I have a small chance to live 60 years more.
---
My eye-hand coordination has never been so good so in games like this I'm not so great. I have no chance to do PvP. Even if I were to have great gear for it, I wouldn't be able to, due to personal abilities, weak computer and slow connection.
---
But I can play mostly fine, and the vats helps a lot. I do miss a lot when not using vats, because the enemies seem to walk and particularly run sideways strafe so weirdly.  I can't play pure FPS shooters because my K/D rate is so bad on them, I've tried but I can only play vehicular games where with some practice you can be average player by being more careful and tactical. If you want to try it MWO is one game where the average player age is something like 40-50, because a large portion of players are old school tabletop battletech fans which restricts the age.
---
I also look forward to the vending, I do trading but I find it difficult because the stuff I have is just mainly bottlecaps, while it seems like 70%-80% of highly active traders have large inventories of duped stuff and thus I have nothing of any value so I can't trade with them. But biggest difficulty is seaching all adds because there's so many posts popping up at high rate, and it's difficult to browse them through.
---
Luckily occasionally some people sell great weapons for caps.
---
I'm glad to hear it can be done. I don't think, however, it's that the Scorchbeasts have a great detection ability, because even when I'm hidden I'm not getting the bonus. I think it's broken. I'm not going to switch up my character to make things work either. I'll wait until they fix it. 
---
14, according to everything I am a piece of trash 
---
Doggo made it and the trick has worked as far as I can tell.
---
You get the Giant Mask if you contribute very little    ....  I've heard. 
---
I have owl, witch, toothy man, soldier, giant and the beret (not a mask but still a drop).  Are any of the others available?
---
Lol so true
---
I think this should go for the rest of the legendary enemy events.
---
I always try and call out, "yo, there's a legendary over here, everyone get a shot in before I have to drop it, its gonna kill me if I don't". And some people come and take a pot shot, but most have no clue why or what I'm calling out. They ones with mics might go "what?" Others I just hear/see nothing. 
---
Im not even using a TSE, so I need &lt;2 shots to kill stuff. It sucks when a legendary is on you, and its like "shit, shit, this needs to go away NOW!"
---
TLDR: Most people (meaning players who don't frequent this sub) have absolutely no  idea how the legendary system works, or really care. Thus, don't expect much to change.
---
Pretty sure the horse isn’t the one that’s high here
---
I’ll see myself out
---
It sounds like you did it first go with no crashing forcing you to start it all over from scratch. No offence, but you haven't seem the full extent of the soul-crushing, tedious, will to live wiping experience this quest used to offer ;)
---
Are these all released? And do u have proof of the ones that arent the common 5?
---
You are not alone, I found someones camp and found a container and it had tons of stuff in it and I thought since it wasnt locked I had hit the jackpot. Took some things I knew I needed and same thing on my trek back to my camp I realized it was it my own stuff.... \*face plant....\*
---
ty for those spots take me a few to confirm them as Ineed to relog to get them to pop up.
---
But if you hadn’t data mined then you wouldn’t know it was there so you wouldn’t have been compelled to save your caps for it and then this wouldn’t have been an issue?
---
I would think griefing would be worse on console because you can join people's servers without having to have them as a friend. 
---
Post apocalyptic OSHA is my new personal faction, all we do is go around fining people caps for unsafe CAMP builds
---
Having just renewed my drivers license, this really hit home with me. My wife and I were laughing the whole way through this.....
---
I don't blame people for wanting to do it, I just blame the lack of depth in the event that basically turns it into a boring march.  It'd be different if the event was better designed so it couldn't be so easily steamrolled. 
---
nice that should stay i have never had it revert back
---
I was following him around the other day. If you get the chance, he says some pretty funny stuff!
---
It's all good btw it just makes me have to think smarter. I came up with the idea of creating a maze so they have to try really hard just to find you. 
---
Helvetica is a horrid font.  Helvetia is a lovely town.
---
58 and loving most aspects of the game.  I play solo as my son hates the grind.  I cannot get my head around the weapons in the game and how get and set up perks to make up all of the cool weapons most seem to have.  Never duped or griefed.  Now lvl 99.  Would love to experience playing in a team to learn more about the game.  XB1 kiloechovictor1
---
These are all the ones everyone has, and it seems very much like theyre the only ones
---
The ones I listed above are ones  I personally have received in game.  The other ones listed on OP are the ones you see the robots wearing. 
---
And that's fine but seems like you're upset because people are PvPing with you because you took a workshop that literally states you are now participating in a PvP event.
---
I understand there is three types of players in this game. PvE PvEvP and PvP AKA those who only want to PvE those who enjoy the slap and those who want a full blown PvP experience. But workshops are now and probably will always be a PvP Event unless they make a 100% pacifist server type or until private shards come out.
---
Whether or not the workshop PvP any where in the world is an exploit or not I couldn't tell you but regardless it does tell you that you're saying come get me when you take a workshop. 
---
Just turned 54 last week... :)
---
If I were a betting man, I would bet that Bethesda put it in the forest so everyone could do it without issues. I do not think they thought “hey let’s put this event in the forest to make it focus on low level players”. They put it there to avoid level locking it. 
---
Most events are simple, the only thing that changes is the level of spawns. 
---
For real? My mother has those sticks but they are all about arm lenght, were there shorter models too or is that some kind of joke referring to later trends of carrying stuff like phones, calculators or leatherman on belt pockets?
---
do you still have the advertisement poster plans? 
---
Thanks for the great reply! I’ll look into. 
---
Not when the weapons do so much damage they only have to hit you once in the best speced power armor then it's not well balanced pvp. It's just plain unfair. I love pvp I just don't love being so out gunned that I can't even compete. 
---
I got over it pretty early on and just server hopped. When you have the Rad Shower, it just gets too pricey to fix. 
---
I agree, but I think it's set up the way it is so that it's accessible to all players.  Outside of the Megasloth there really isn't anything that you can't handle shortly after leaving the vault.
---
Maybe the next seasonal event can be in a higher level area or just feature strong enemies *shrug*.
---
Yup! Keeps happening to me, what sucks is i look at the downed mobs and i see there's 3 legendaries laying next to each other. Its like the game just said NOPE! No legendaries for you!
---
Yeah XD I ran out of fusion cores through the endeavor and tried juggling the event. Let’s just say I’m not proud of the equipment I brought with me today XD
---
Bloodied Explosive
---
Yes I do
---
They wouldn't be charcoal if they had good intentions. As long as you're not baiting them to their death, you won't go to hell lol
---
Just tell yourself its to stop those pesky molerats as you set up 8 flamers and 8 coils with a sea of spikes and slappy things.
---
It’s likely the interface we will experience when we get decorating items from a shelf, magazine rack or other display case.
---
And different colors for each teammate 
---
I heard quite a bit of it waiting for my turn to trade with him
---
&gt;There are a few easy ways to fix this that don't remove the PVP aspect of workshops.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You have to choose to defend your workshop before PVP can be initiated. If you think they're just trying to goad you then you should be able to concede the workshop without a fight.  
---
&gt;Fighting over workshops should not involve caps changing hands on player death. Maybe to prevent a battle of attrition make it to where you can only try to retake the workshop so many times before you're locked out for an hour.
---
I don't get why you couldn't just so with the more sensible if you're within the workshop area while it's being contested, you're in PvP, if you're not, no PvP for either party and normal slap rules apply.
---
Last bit is important as without it, the owner could sit just outside the workshop area and hit the intruders with full PvP damage.
---
I had some super mutants come at me. Graham didn't care until one hit his moo-moo. Then shit got real.
---
I have a ton of cool outfits. I just see a few people will a full set of crisp brotherhood combat armor and brotherhood under armor and I get jealous lol. 
---
Can confirm Effigy. We got one so far. 
---
Also got Fasnacht Pole Lanterns as well.
---
Merman and Demon masks are the only two I thought of but wasn’t sure if you described those already.
---
Curious if the Old Man Winter blue mask could be rng from the nuked event? 
---
I use TSE with piercing mods and a couple perks that help bypass some armor and increase damage. Works well as it stacks.
---
I would expect they will release one extra per day and it will be considered "rare".  You probably want to play every day during the event to try to get them all.
---
I would also like there to be more enemies. Many times there are players with a very high level and almost no time to kill any enemy. For example, the final enemy is destroyed too quickly. Otherwise the event is very cool
---
If you walk into the side of the foundation where you get “stuck” you can grab them 
---
Get banned for what, playing the game as Bethesda planned?
---
That makes more sense than either of my ideas. Now that the claim area is the whole settlement there is no reason it shouldn't be like that.
---
Fucccck that would be sick.
---
And I'm saying that "come get me" when claiming a workshop needs to go away for the players who prefer a pacifist pve experience. Let's put it this way. Imagine there's a new fried chicken restaurant in town, people go there to get chicken because they like to eat chicken. Now imagine there's a group of people who don't like chicken, so they reach out to the owner and ask "any chance you can add fried fish to your menu?" This does not take away the experience of the people who like chicken. It just adds something new for those who don't. Repeatedly saying "well it's a chicken restaurant, you should expect chicken" doesn't negate the needs of those who prefer fish.
---
Upvoted for visibility. Beth needs to make that happen.
---
I get what you're saying, but unless your guy's weapons/traits were excellent, it was most likely the the others that did the real damage and killed her. I don't know what else could be the issue. I'm hitting her with syringers to lower her damage resist, tossing orbital strike beacons, using all my stealth weapons and ammo, with what should be stealth bonuses that aren't popping. I'm doing my damndest and I look around and see level 20s and 40s and I know they aren't putting up high damage. No need to be a dick, I'm just trying to figure this out. 
---
Yup, today after the inclusion a new event, the game starts crashes right in main menu after pressing any button
---
&gt; To keep players playing you make them grind for an arbitrary amount of time for miniscule rewards. Fallout 76 doesn't do this,
---
So I understand you're not grinding legendary spawns for that max lvl AAE or BE gun? Because that's in the game as well.
---
what system you on?
---
No dice, sadly. I even have one letter that is floating quite some distance off the wall yet is still attached even when I'm perfectly perpendicular to the wall. The tooltip even says "concrete foundation" when only that side of the letter is the only thing under the mouse.
---
Xbox 
---
Hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush...
---
Is the Jester, Old man Winter, Sunshine, Devil, and Skull even available yet?
---
If you're lucky you'll get a visit from a higher level player thats bored and helpful. Sometimes we look for you little guys and spend some time sorting out your camps and answering questions if you'll have us. Can't trust everyone though, so keep your guard up for a bit.
---
I'll  usually wave and drop some plans and screws or something. No guns out at all, and as a show of trust I'll step out of my power armor. 
---
Ty and confirmed.
---
This is what I'm talking about, in terms of low level players! The stealth bonus not working is another issue entirely, however. I've never seen a level 400. Crazy! 
---
Yeah thats what ive been thinking too, was planning on going for 20-30 sets of plans anyway so that shouldnt be an issue :p
---
Uh, pick up the armor!  Also it takes 10 minutes max to server hop until another parade.  But I would say to also use the new report button as well.  Also, that idiot is just wasting their own time.
---
Yes.
---
You're going to need to grind. I suggest West Tek, just the outside of it anyway. Since you said you have high sneak I'm assuming sniper? If you pick off the mutants outside of it they provide good XP and resources to replace your ammo and repair your stuff. You can also try to grind out t51 PA, which is great PA, even at higher levels.
---
Man, I can only imagine how infuriating that must have been.  Excited to play a game and then you move at a snail's pace for a week.  Oofta
---
You can't pick other peoples PA
---
Haha I’ll keep that in mind. Fallout is my favorite series and I’m super excited 76 has gotten better. I can’t wait to dive deep into it all 
---
Where at in  pleasant valley ?
---
Yeah I joined the event with like 15 other players and just stood there taking pictures until it was done
---
Nope, its likely theyll release a new one each day though since there are a lot not available currently
---
I fell for that too... i can't remember which vendor i saw those plans at either.
---
So the problem here is, if you remove the PvP aspect now you have a free extremely good way to farm mats with no risk at all, and short of adding a Scorched Beast Queen to the raiding list there isn't any amount of mobs that would really pose threats to players owning a workshop.
---
I can sympathized that it would be annoying for someone just to kill you with no intention of taking the workshop but that's the price you pay for having a good way to farm mats. 
---
Don’t forget the beret 😊
---
Iv gotten that code before. I try to load in 3-4 times and then it works. Idk what that code is all about. Just try a few times. 
---
Suspended accounts get a different code. Or at least my other account does. 
---
What are you trying to stabilize?  I have some stable flux if you need it (in case your raw goes bad).  Pm me your username :)
---
Have you tried rebooting the game? Everybody gets that error ever now and again.
---
Hey I hate to say it but guess who looks to be right in the worst way possible.... 
---
Which is why we're discussing ways to add risk or lower rewards. This is a discussion on how to make workshops on a PVE server work. 
---
Great post...  I just turned 54 myself and play the game on my PS4 with over 700 hours so far.
---
It was a spur of the moment join for me too. My last fight ended with me having some dead weapons, low ammo and 15% power left in the last core i had on me. More in stash box, but that was close to being a real idiot problem to have while being a 130+
---
I'm not sure if it's a glitch or if I'm simply not damaging it enough but it seems like the last two I did had the sloth die so quick it didn't produce loot.  It probably was just me not damaging it quickly enough as while level 41 getting sneak attack criticals with a suppressed combat rifle handles most stuff I've come across it's not keeping up with the weapons the higher level people have.
---
My son was wrongfully banned and has never been unbanned.  He got one response from bethesda saying his ban would remain.  I requested the proof of the reason for his ban and never recevied any response.  After the last two patches I have sent more messages to bethesda asking why he is still banned despite the saying that his original ban was for duping and that he would be unbanned when duping was patched.  They have claimed to patch duping bugs in both patches.  I continue to receive no response from Bethesda.
---
All right! I shall keep this is mind thank you kind stranger!
---
Again, everybody can do events, but the region and environment of events dictate the difficulty and complexity of the event.  The Forest is a low level zone, and Helvetia is located in that zone.  By being in the Forest, the event has some concessions to fit it into the level-preference of that zone, just the same as how an event like Fertile Soil is clearly made for players pretty much starting out, but anybody can do it.
---
If your on xbox, message me on there and we can help you out a bit. 
---
Nope.
---
I’m on PS4 but I appreciate the offer. 
---
 The same happened with my account as well. Bethesda need to do something with this, and I didn't receive any notice about this even via email
---
 I am a well-known streamer in FO76 Russian community with more than 600 hours gameplay, feel free to check YouTube or Twitch if you don't believe. 
---
Whitespring top floor right room in the last (unlocked) house to your left when heading from golfcourse to resort. Usually there is a boss ghoul there. Its in the shower next to a dead body
---
Straight up fuck that guy it wasnt funny after the first minute 
---
I’m so desperate for those military bags but 300 caps ain’t a half bad price 
---
I see a few posts and the one thing in common is the parade.
---
I use this page. I find it very good and if you are looking for guides or a good build for your character you can find them. [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/f/fo76-guides/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/f/fo76-guides/)
---
There were many versions we used models about 8 to 10 inches long as I recall but I have seen shorter ones with smaller font characters smaller in size
---
LOL.  You had a learning experience.  You're only dumb if you do it again.
---
In 100% down with your first suggestion.  Every other time someone wants to PvP its opt-in and workshops should he no different.    The message that pops up is informing you that the workshop can be stolen from you at anytime and that you might need to PvP to stop it from being stolen, not that by taking the workshop means you want to PvP.
---
Workshops are literally the only way an attacking player can disengage the SLAP damage system against their attacker.  You're right that this is being abused by people with no interest in using the workshop itself.
---
This is extremely wholesome, if you ever need any stimpacks, I'd be happy to give you some!
---
It's not a mask.
---
Not being a dick, totally sincere in my apology. I assumed I could do it whenever I liked and wasn't aware I needed your farken permission. I will gladly be a dick over an elitist. Not all lower levels are there to tag, maybe they were the ones that launched the nuke and have a vested interest in killing the SBQ. 
---
Was making cobalt and ran short on mass. Not a big deal but didn't want to waste the 40 raw cobalt i have left
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
Its a drop but not a mask.  Although it honestly my favourite.
---
What does the giant mask look like?
---
nice i would love to come by and meet your new doggo it have a name yet?
---
Definitely attach dollar values unless you're trading with someone you trust. 400 caps each and you've spent nothing. If they take and run, you're 400 up.
---
What is razograin flour?!
---
They are directly taken from the strings of the game. It could be that everyday they make a group of masks avaiable because I only got the Giant, Owl, Witch, Toothy Man and Soldier
---
Fort Defiance. 4th floor I think behind the locked door. Or it’s the armory on 3rd. There’s one in there  
---
Same thing happened to me. Got same message again for doing same event several times. Even been taking it easy with my toon when comes to inventory.
---
Hello there, this won't help.
---
if you want a challenge, nuke the area. force it to be a high level zone
---
Gotcha. I have a little stable cobalt if you need it, but yeah- having all the right mats in roughly equal quantities is a pain
---
I mean, I see what you mean, but it's also not very nice to think people shouldn't have options just because they don't know something or learn the same way.
---
What I think might be a good option is an optional tutorial. The game can start you off with little pop-ups, and you have the option to turn it off. This would be useful all around, I think, and encourage more people to try new games.
---
I added the  Watoga EMS  ty for that.
---
ooh, that's a good idea
---
My copy of Fallout 76 should be delivered Friday, it was the roadmap that got me over to ordering it.
---
Suspended account getting exact the same code, believe me 
---
it does have a carry weight bonus, of only +100. the glitch gives you +200 until you exit the armor
---
If you have a workshop, its not griefing.  Its simply gameplay.  I randomly take workshops just for the fun of it.  If you dont want people attacking you, dont take a workshop!
---
Sure thing, I’m doing a mask run atm but I can show you after. Gamer tag is ModestSphinxy. As far as a name goes I’m conflicted, I was to name after irl doggo but today I witnessed some murder my pet Mirelurks and idk if I could handle that well. 
---
Okay. Well maybe don't dupe or whatever you did to get banned in the first place :)
---
Agreed. Can't wait for sentinel to to nurfed into the ground. No way this can keep happening.
---
Remember when everyone was mad about TSE being way overpowered and unfair in pvp and it got nerfed? 
---
When a guy in pajamas and a silly mask can 1 hit a scorched beast or a any player, you better believe its only a matter of time before Bethesda balances the hell out of it. 
---
Yup, today after the inclusion a new event, the game starts crashes right in main menu after pressing any button. I completely disabled all mods, made game verification but this not help. Then i completely remove game and did a full registry cleaning. Downloaded game again and used another disc. But it didn't help. Crash in main menu...
---
let alone driving through a Nuked area. Low level folks would just melt if they aren't paying attention and cross through one.
---
If the math is correct the anti armour variant is better for more consistent damage. 
---
there are 7 different protectrons.  Only 5 spawn during the quest at random.
---
Where's the general area? 
---
I didn't played at all since unsuspension :), as mentioned above I just did  3 Faschnacht events only. 
---
So..
---
They need to add a photo emote. Well, they need to add a lot of emotes. But awesome photo!
---
Did you stream your duping/reason you were suspended?
---
Nice try on that sincerity 
---
It is doable but right now the least number of players doing the event is around 10.  You are more likely to get bored fro not killing much of the incredibly weak enemies.
---
If you need more guidance than “you are over encumbered, you can not run” the. I’m afraid you may have autism. How much more simple can that be? If you don’t know what it means then google “Skyrim what is over encumbered?” You will find it instantly. The person you replied to was not wrong. The game literally tells you what the problem is. The game also comes with a manual (which the game also tells you to read before playing) In that manual there’s button mapping and control layouts. Also, in the settings you can change he controls to whatever you like. I’m assuming it also says *that* in a manual. Games aren’t “abandoning casuals” or however you dramatically put it. People are becoming increasingly lazy and don’t want to read clearly written instructions that come with the product. Simple as that my dude
---
One of the bridges. There is a mr handy in the middle. It activated the event when I got close to him. It is on the far side of town from where you fast travel in at. 
---
There was a younger guy we used to play with, always wanted to fight everyine to prove how big his johnson was. Outside his house for the last time, kid lipping off as usual, i tossed a few strike beacons at his house. He panicked, lost his loot and house.
---
He doesn't do that anymore.
---
I've been saving plans for a low level alt, but I hadn't thought of that. Great idea. 
---
Your Welcome :)
---
Store it. I think that will break it down to it's components.
---
I haven't been able to play all week. Hopefully I can still participate tomorrow morning. 
---
I's this an On-map location or just a random bridge somewhere? 
---
Nice of you but im good. Thanks for the offer
---
Well he’s not wrong.
---
Back up a second. Can we not all cry “TSE” every time something gets killed to quick? You do realize the AAE ( anti armor explosive) and BE (bloodied explosive) and do the same if not more damage.
---
I will agree with you people are idiots , but with the state of griefing in general, I have to believe anyone doing that amount of damage, knows exactly what there doing. 
---
And for the record you can use an explosive weapon or two shot explosive and not “one shot” things. It’s how you set your cards up. For example if I have no additional explosive cards, glow sight, or bloody mess cards equipped my tse combat shot gun will take close to 10 bullets to kill a lvl 68 super mutant. So not just to you but anyone that reads this and cry’s “TSE” on Reddit, please stop being ignorant.... I’m sorry there are assholes in game, I understand, believe me. There were plenty of parades I did tonight that the sloth got killed before it ever hit the ground... but nothing we can do about it... hope for better luck in the next round.
---
I feel guilty when I drink its milk though.
---
To wash down its medium rare deliciousness.
---
So .. ? Perhaps you wouldn't have this problem if you didn't get yourself banned in the first place? Or you could just try my original advice and reboot the game. Or could try asking Bethesda and not Reddit? 
---
If the donut plan is the recipe for the event donuts then I would say the sausages would have a recipe also.
---
Hey, your food and drink might as well come from the same place!
---
Good catch. With rifles 1100/1100
---
I was just about to type this very thing. Lol. There’s a video of someone on YouTube getting harassed by a group of bloodied deathclaw gauntlets. The person who I assume is female by the voice whips out a suppressors gamma gun and deletes all of them. Didn’t even take 1 hit. Karma is bliss. 
---
I completed it two times and got 2 owl masks the garland plan and sausage recipe
---
Possibly, haven't gotten it yet though.
---
I enjoyed it for a second. But then it was just like “okay I get it. DMV bad. Haha funny joke Bethesda.” I was also trying to wrap up the quest before I had to leave for work so it made me more annoyed.
---
Also got a Fasnacht barrett
---
next time that happens just log out real quick usually it just comes right back
---
I think many players, particularly youngsters, are slow to realize that gaming and the MMO concept existed when they were babies, or perhaps not even born yet.  
---
76 is a game that sort of bridges a generational divide in gaming.  As a man in his 40's, I was a young teen playing Wasteland with a friend during weekend sleepovers, and fell in love with Fallout 1 while I was in college.  Up until now, the franchise has always been a solo experience, so I never had the opportunity to interact with other players of a younger generation and different upbringing.  
---
Younger players seem to have a more competitive bend to their gaming, what with online shooters and pvp being immensely popular for their generation.  To some degree my generation had that, only it was limited to a dorm-wide Doom LAN, or going back even further to four friends sitting in front of a single screen playing Goldeneye.  The first time I played with complete strangers in a competitive setting online left a terrible taste in my mouth, so I've largely avoided it ever since.
---
I've largely been a solo-oriented player, but I did play Dungeons and Dragons Online for 3-4 years (I basically quit playing regularly when Fo4 came out) and enjoyed building up a small group of close friends with acquaintances and guildies that created a little social bubble.  I'm already seeing the foundation of that network forming for me with a couple good gaming pals, meeting their friends, and gathering together to launch nukes, participate in blasts and helping each other with gear, supplies and loot.
---
Who sells em?
---
Super lame.  I am always wary about other players around my camp, especially when it's a group.  Unfortunately, if there's a group and you're alone, there's pretty much nothing you can do except what you did, log off asap.  
---
Even if you manage to kill one, the other is still there, and the one you killed can still just seek revenge and come right back.  Not to mention if and when you do give up, the friend can just kill the other and remove any bounty that was taken.
---
Hopefully the majority of griefers will move to survival mode and this will become less of a thing to worry about.  
---
A phot emote is available in the atomic shop, I use it all the time.
---
Most small critters will still drop the item. I was no more than 30 feet from v76 and chicken were dropping intestines. 
---
Military bags are just dropped but the BF bulk is in Watoga and Harpers Ferry 
---
You will be happy to know that while doing the BETA, I did that not once or twice, but around 4-5 times before I moved my camp so I'd stop getting confused.
---
Then I forgot how to locate my camp.
---
Sometimes I'm really proud of myself for being in graduate school and studying so hard for so long. Other times, I'm swiftly reminded how accurate blonde jokes have always been. 
---
Wish we could sell the raw for big bucks still :/
---
I think a saw a note in the church that said "The Harvester"
---
Perhaps we should just put "also, stop deleting short title posts, that rule sucks" at the end of the title of every post? You know it'll be long enough to pass through the filter that way.
---
I got chased off my buddies camp after making a barbecue fence for his brahmin. I see it as food and a carry weight buff, he sees it as a renewable resource...
---
I tried, he was sadly gone gone, he wasn’t counting against my budget. I was logging out before the guy got the last hit off too. When I logged back in he was gone and part of my camp was destroyed. 
---
I saw you there.
---
that guys a douchebag hope everyone reported him.
---
Yikes.
---
I got sausage recipe earlier so yes there is one 
---
You sir get my upvote for that logic, and the chuckle it gave me. 
---
Yes. It is my welcome. You have once again proven redditors are proudly ignorant people. 
---
Rebooted and reinstalled. Ticket is raised to Bethesda support, but just got the response that I'm not eligible to play FO76 because I didn't bought it.
---
Haha I’m definitely in the later camp. I can eat just about anything, but you ever try milking a molerat?
---
Yeah, it's really coming along. Still some bugs and such, but fun anyway. 
---
I play with guys I have served with in the military. We are all in our sixties. We played Aftermath! In college. It was an extremely complex paper and pencil Survival RPG. We immediately jumped on the Falloff 76 bandwagon when it came out. I’m pretty sure that some of our character names are the ones we have been using in RPG’s for 40 years. 
---
Charleston Firehouse as well, on the roof.
---
How do you know they were banned?
---
Done it 3 times so far and got 2 giant mask and 1 toothy man mask
---
I can’t find it in the in game atomic shop anymore... maybe i have to log out =\
---
RogueAOV is my name in the game, i usually play for an unhealthy amount each day :p 
---
 I completely disabled all mods, made game verification but this not help. Then i completely remove game and did a full registry cleaning. Downloaded game again and used another disc. But it didn't help me
---
If I store the block, it can't be placed back in that spot since it took advantage of a bug that's since been fixed but grandfathered in for existing structures.
---
I thought it was live? I've been waiting a while for the event to start.
---
You can nuke it and cool down is hour per server but you can just server hop n go into diff ones instead of waiting 
---
:( i hate the humans in this game 
---
Food food man. I've eaten TRUCKLOADS of 25 year old canned dog food. Molerat milk can't be that bad lol
---
Sure you did.
---
I could server hop with a one in three chance my camp doesn't spawn in next time, robbing me of a free fast travel spot plus all my workbenches and stash. Plus, the option to move servers so my camp spawns in next time is bugged for me, creating the need to do a hard reset so I prefer not to risk it. And besides, why should I leave when I was minding my own business.
---
I could stay on the save server and block those players, but then I also wouldn't be able to see where they are and that's a no go. I need to be able to see where pests are so I can avoid them later on in the session.
---
Bethesda could do away with this system and create a truly pacifist mode for all the buyers who constantly ask for it.
---
Annoying pests could stop being annoying pests.
---
Lots of people could do lots of things. 
---
What a cuck
---
So much room for activities! 
---
Play the game the way you want to play that gives u enjoyment. I can go weeks without even looking at the daily challenges. Its an optional extra. If you want an atom store item then go buy it or not. Its all optional! 
---
I can't think of a single game that doesn't have a tutorial, but I guess if you ignore that, it'd be good to have a refresher. Normally if I'm having an issue and can't figure out something in the game I go to the "controls" section and see if I'm missing something.  I can't even imagine fighting with something in a game for an entire week, and returning it instead of looking up to see why that aspect of the game is that way, and if I'm doing something wrong. Everyone learns differently, of course, but if you refuse to ask for help, it's kind of on you, and not every other person doing that thing. 
---
I'm with you. Did the same thing, only to realize half way it was my own stash xD
---
Where do you get the drop from
---
Who's being a dik now.
---
FYI your a redditor, so welcome to your own ignorance.
---
Git Gud.
---
Yeah, they are the least fun part of this game sometimes. Anyways feel free to stop by and give the pupper a pat when I’m on, sadly I think it’s time for sleep for me. 
---
From completing the fasnacht parade event.  It is one of the rarer drops though.
---
You can, but it breaks the event
---
I've only done the event once this morning before work and got a giant mask and the beret. I didn't know it was rare
---
Hmm maybe I’ll go find a brood mother and try it out :P
---
I 100% agree with you if there wasn't weapons that one shot top speced power armor and the PvP was balanced whether that's through nurfs to guns, buffs to armor, or normalized PvP. 
---
It's in the forest I dont think you can nuke that area
---
Ahhh. Can't you use the replace button to change it to a wooden one? May be possible to grab it then.
---
Ok thanks
---
That happened to me twice in the first month. Happens much less, now that i keep the decon shower stored and my base on top of a mountain. But your right, it feels weirdly, viscerally, bad. Like its just wrong. Sure, materials mean nothing after level 100, but still. Theres nothing you can do against it, and they're so persistent.
---
You just have to play smarter!
---
Did you try to attack them?
---
With the amount of people at each event right now, I’d think you could probably kill 1 person even with slap damage.  6-7 other people focusing on one person could probably take them out.  
---
The caps for killing him were nice for a while though aside from when he started blowing himself up. I still don't understand why they felt the need to continue though, after the 15th or so time, you'd think they'd get bored and move on.
---
That's not a bad idea honestly. I'll give it a shot in the morning :)
---
Cant pvp in events 
---
:D
---
Lvl 115, I have a pretty decent melee build, but rarely go to the SBQ fight because I feel useless while she's in the air.  I can hit her with my weak ass rifles(Mutant's Explosive Combat Rifle, no perks), but it doesn't seem to do anything.  When she lands I can do some work and take the damage even in a hazmat suit, but it feels like anything ranged just bounces off of her.  What can I do as a melee first player to do damage while she's in flight?  Taking out the mobs is fine and easy enough, but not being able to find the loot afterwards kind of sucks.   I'd love to participate in more queen fights, but feel like I'm the lvl 115 version of what OP is referring to. 
---
Yeah it made no sense with the longest time survived, while it would be neat to see that if the metric was actually even remotely accurate and not just some nerd just AFKing for the "prestige"
---
Honestly won't know how things will play out until next week but I'm hoping they'll listen to the feedback from people who'll actually play the servers.
---
Ugh, duh.  Yeah. 
---
I'd love for people to fast travel to my camp and not spawn in my floor every time. Doesn't matter where i place the camp thing either.
---
Thanks, good to know.
---
Not knowing is much more Wasteland-ish.
---
Twice so far, a tooth and soldier mask, a beret, and a garland plan.
---
I left a game in Helvetia, next time I logged in, someone had nuked the place...like, who does that? Not to mention all the low level people that wanna participate in it now most likely can't because of it, as  a lot of lower levels don't have a Hazmat suit.
---
It just seems like an a-hole thing to do. Especially considering it's a place that never gets nuked, as there was no reason to.
---
Taking out the scorched is an extremely important job in the SBQ fight and melee excels at it.  When you take out enough of them the queen will land, and then you can lay waste to her.  Honestly even being a ranged class it’s difficult sometimes to hit her in the air, she dodges so much and you aren’t really doing considerable damage until she lands. 
---
Man, I honestly quit the game....Fallout 76 pissed me off so bad about the industry I havent played games since a few days after this post.
---
I agree that the workshop pvp is wonky at the moment. But taking a workshop comes with the risk of pvp. I used to build shops for fun too. But it's really not worth the time for resources or even just longevity of it being there. I go to taken workshops looking for a fight or take one myself. 
---
Every so often I will take it for the odd resource but only when I know I will be able to defend myself whenever for a while. As for the snowballing of the people that buy gear with pvp caps. Don't think it's the case, most sought after pvp gear is trade only mostly. Hoarding caps has less benefits the higher your level in my opinion.
---
Bless you kind wanderer!
---
Stop cheating?
---
Thats a shame, would have been a nice easter egg opportunity. Maybe that's why the nuke cool down is 100+ hrs right now? Seems like a good anti-troll move for the week.
---
That was kind of my thought process. I was like, i could try to real quick switch out of pacifist mode and try to kill these guys, but all of my shit would have been wrecked by that point and who knows how that would have turned out as i don't really pvp much.
---
I feel like I've heard an idea floating around about not allowing camp damage if you're in
---
pacifist mode. Something like that would be nice... but you're right, hopefully they mostly all clear out and grief each other in survival mode.
---
Did you just buy a key or a second hand copy? Were you cheating?
---
Yeah, some of them are like "omg come on really, again?", but you don't \*have\* to do them. I pick the ones I want to do, and just do those. If I'm done with those and one of the others isn't too bad I normally do that. If there's something I just have no interest in, I just don't do it. 
---
And 50 boozes isn't that difficult. The past few days have had me making a lot of booze, and with what you find around the world, I'm already almost to 50 and I've been playing just over an hour this evening. 
---
I did 7/10 types of alcohol this morning before work, with what I already had on hand plus one run for raizorgrain.   
---
For me, it gives me something to do while playing the game. I'm done with all the actual quests, so I'm happy to have a reason to keep playing.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I'm trying to join you now!
---
I've already gotten dupes of a couple masks...not gotten the beret yet...but I have gotten a bunch of CAMP plans for an Old Man Summer/Winter (I forget) Effigy, streamers/banners, balloons and a couple other things.
---
 Yup, today after the inclusion a new event, the game starts crashes right in main menu after pressing any button. I completely disabled all mods, made game verification but this not help. Then i completely remove game and did a full registry cleaning. Downloaded game again and used another disc. But it didn't help. Crash in main menu... 
---
Something like the welcome mat from FO4 would be great for that.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
That is your choice.... I did not server hop at all. I still don't have the jacket. My gameplay is not affected at all
---
I've pre-ordered game in Jun 18, on official Bethesda web site. This was just an automated response to the ticket, robots on duty :)
---
I do but there is no cover that can protect you because of the two shot explosive. It either near instantly destroys walls which the spalsh damage from explosive hits you through walls or they just have to hit near you to actually get a hit. It's not fair when one weapon in the game is the golden key to all problems. On top of the fact it is rare and obtaining it is expensive in one way or another. There should be more than a handful of guns that are viable for PvP. Not to mention that this is a single player RPG with live service and PvP elements added on as an after thought. There must be balance in a game like this, if you don't believe me look at the old PvP in world of Warcraft and you get a similar picture.
---
Seems like you engaged in a duel and got smoked. Nuking the event is kind of funny tho. If it wasn't your cup of tea just leave and find a new server
---
I got a witch mask first try, but it sucks to hear you might not get one. 
---
Want me to stay while you, hop to reset inventory?
---
Bloodied Build = Tryhard Build
---
Same here. My first ya,e was colossal cave on a prime IV. Then the Fairchild channel F came out.
---
This almost happened to me once when I revisited the Overseer's C.A.M.P.
---
Cool.one sec
---
I did that multiple times in the beginning when playing with my brother. I would start looting this box thinking to myself "This stuff looks so familiar"... And then it would dawn on me and I would be like "F@$#!" And begin trying to figure out what stuff was in there so I could put it back. Lol
---
Did you research Besthedas reaction to Mods in Fallout 76?
---
Lol! Same. I had to quit playing FPS for that reason
---
This guy never rented a NES game from Blockbuster without a manual before.
---
I didn't know killing the scorched mobs made her land.  I know the difficulty goes up with more players, and I kinda felt like a dick going in with no ranged option.  Glad to hear this as now I can go mow down whatever pops up in the zone.  Time to look for a Zealots or AA swing speed meat hook!
---
accounts were unbanned and banned again after 4 days.
---
This may be a stupid question, but is the Dense secondary chest mod unlearnable?  I have two characters around lvl 150-160 each and have scrapped literally every piece of armor I've ever found, and probably crafted and scrapped several hundred lvl 20 combat chest pieces, and maybe a couple thousand metal and leather pieces.
---
I find it interesting and odd that marine armor was easily top end in Fo4, but it's pretty middle of the road in 76.
---
&gt; As soon as you claim a workshop you are open to immediate full pvp as soon as someone contests it. 
---
Have you tried to counter it? Make the workshop expensive to claim.
---
&gt; Players are using the above strategy to make caps quickly and buy better PVP gear, to in turn keep making caps
---
In where exactly? Pls tell me where you can buy better PvP with mere bottlecaps? Lol.
---
&gt;I am ashamed to admit that in my frustration after the last time it happened to me I found another server and regained my caps doing just that.
---
Your mighty caps? We are talking like few houndreds of bottlecaps here, max? Duh, you had to regain them?
---
57 here. In my day, we didn’t have a mouse. We had 4K and were glad for it! Our multiplayer ya,es were hurling stones at each other. In the snow. Uphill.
---
It's not really stupid. The way stashes work is bizarre to begin with. It's more rational to think it's not your box. I appreciate the convenience but, part of me wishes you had to 'tag' a box as being your stash for it to actually show your stash. 
---
I'm far, far, far past you in terms of level and play time, but I \*still\* open stashes and catch myself thinking "wow look at all that... oh."
---
TSEs do not OHK anymore.  That was fixed in patch 5.
---
This is not a single player game.  It is a multiplayer game that players can play alone and ignore others if they wish.
---
It’s funny you say that, I was thinking about the idea of trying to build a “trap” in my camp that locks unwantables in.. problem is I don’t want to gyp the average player. If they’re going to hose your base they’re going to come prepared.
---
Not all suspended... My Storage PSN Account was Banned
---
This Time he‘s not Banned
---
Some are rare have seen players wearing sun, devil today.
---
&gt;, the only real counter to it is adding lots of high level turrets facing the work bench and the surrounding area.
---
Lol sure. I mean, nope. 
---
The workshop device has become irrelevant. It's still cute how some people place their turrets around it, like the enviroment enemies could destroy it. Im pretty sure it can't be destroyed, they sure don't like to attack it, at least.
---
I quite like leaving any extra stuff I have in the overseer's stash in Flatwoods for other people to take. I really want to build a container than *can* be looted by other players in my CAMP, but unfortunately there's no such option yet.
---
It'd be nice though! Occasional just make a bunch of guns and leave them for lower level players, good way to clear out the stash.
---
I read this thread after completing my first Helvetia event with a bunch of randoms working together! Don’t lose hope.
---
Got a spare Ultracite Power Armor set I don't need if you're still interested! Will be on tomorrow if you are
---
I hear if you nuke it it breaks it, so please don't.
---
Hahaha 4 hours to go!!
---
I'm not on about the train station vendor. Literally inside the whitespirngs on the bottom floor where there's several shops... 
---
I'm ok with it how it is, it's supposed to be a fun parade, not a wicked hard parade. It'd suck to get 90% done and then have a bunch of baddies wreck it. 
---
Some fool wasted 400+  10mm shots firing one at a time with Perfect Storm just to watch the Balloons burn 1 second before popping...
---
What a fasnacht!
---
I never understood why they unlocked them in the first place maybe it was accident..
---
No, afaik there’s no way to follow people around on a server as far as I know.. unless your friends. People don’t friend each other unless there’s a good bond from my experience.
---
Yep! 
---
I remember seeing a stash at a red rocket station and seeing some nice weapons in it. Thought I hit the motherload; I grabbed what I could and dragged it back home. 
---
My main character is a heavy gunner in this and even with all the perks I'm constantly over encumbered and end up walking everywhere 
---
It comes with a manual? Where is that? Never seen one. 
---
I agree with this as long as people aren’t server chasing you, that’s a completely different story. I play on PS4 so I don’t know if that’s even possible elsewhere 
---
I'm saying if he "nukes half the town" no critters will spawn for a good distance outside the blast zone. Yes, you can just go somewhere else and get the intestines and go into the blast zone.
---
You’re the only one drinking juice boxes fatboy, that being said, you’re also obviously a moron.
---
That word is just as delightful to read as it is to hear. :-D
---
Specs: 10 DPS, gives you 'blood pack' once in a while 
---
Hmm no, workshop is always owned by one player.
---
why do you think you're getting banned? you didnt write anything in the body
---
Troll account.
---
It has 1 karma don't waste your time 
---
Trolls will be trolls eh, how’s the skin infection from being on your couch 24/7?
---
Bethesda should  change the camp destruction thing..   You should be able to destroy someones camp if that player attacks you,  if a player doesnt fights back then you cant damage someones camp.
---
Griefers would get bored and stop playing eventually 
---
Yup. No hate at all if someone challenges my workshop. I’m really confused by reading all these comments though, that hasn’t happened to me a single time.
---
That’s absolutely diabolical!
---
Of 100. Not 200. The extra boost is a bug from launch that resurfaced 
---
More like Bethesda has cheap servers that can’t keep up.
---
&gt; I ultimately gain caps and junk from camp smashing
---
No you get caps/junk from PvP, there are options besides attacking someone or their CAMP.  Once the person your attacking indicates they arent fighting back you get nothing but satisfaction from annoying them, the caps and junk come from the PvP afterwards.
---
PvP is opt-in in this game.  You and all the "raiders" try to make not PvPing in fallout sound as absurd as not PvPing in Apex or something.  Sure in Apex continuing to shoot someone who's running away isn't griefing, takes a lot of willful ignorance to say the same about continuing to shoot someone running away in 76 though.
---
I understand the PvP mechanics just fine thanks.  I done think the problem is me not wanting to PvP or my assessment of this game's optional PvP mechanics.  The people in denial are jerks like you who can only have fun when actively causing another grief but call it being a "raider" and get willfully ignorant of all the other, much more direct, ways to PvP.
---
Well fuck them. You're allowed to play a game and if you have fun, dont let them stop you. My buddy and I are usually free to play if you need a good group.
---
I can confirm that they do still one shot kill I had it happen to me yesterday and two days ago. When I die in a second at full health in maxed out pa there can't be any doubt it isn't one shoting me. If I'm wrong I want to accept it and learn from my mistakes and get better but in this situation idk how I can be wrong. 
---
It is based on the fallout 4 engine and had multiplayer features graphted on to it. Plus it is almost identical to fallout 4 in a gameplay sense, it even had the same bugs as it's predecessor. 
---
Ok thank you
---
I did same lol. Overcumbered I had to walk for about 10 min to my camp. Imagine my surprise when I saw my stash empty lol
---
&gt;all i wanted were my screws back...
---
Screws are valuable. Also the level 189 probably has like 10 times more weapons than you. So you need a lot of screws to repair some of them. Obviously if someone takes your screws, they keep them.
---
The trick is, don't have them.
---
Exactly. I suppose i could do something extreme like find and nuke their camp, but then I'm kind of sinking down to that level
---
Once an hour after it last played.  Server hopping is OK and works.
---
I've seen posts where a player was trying to be helpful and letting others know there is a box with a ton of stuff. He finally realized he was looking into his own stash.  Don't feel bad. It happens. Thanks for sharing, it was good for a chuckle. I bet that walk took forever. 😜
---
Do the "Powering Up" quests at the three power plants, in a group if you can (faster/easier). You get the Fusion Reactor, as well as the other generators, as rewards. As for a level requirement, I'm not too sure. I got mine well past L50, mostly because I focused on other stuff before diving into Power Plants.
---
Idk how you'd do it. The only thing that can't be destroyed are floors and stairs. Maybe you could stack floors on one another. Idk it's an interesting problem to solve. 
---
the one on the 4th floor was already reported. But the 3rd floor I just confirmed it thanks.
---
I tested this with friends and it seems that the protections will go through the Armor after about half a minute, although the MC seemed to have more issues than them.
---
Yeah, I don't use the mic or team cause even though Fallout 76 has a great player base some one will still be a fuckhead or I'll have a friend who played only the B.E.T.A for 76 but shit on like he's clocked 76 (heh) hours but yeah if I knew who I was teaming with I would totally be down, so what do you play on?
---
Interesting do you think it's changed. I thought it used to be that way?
---
I'll be home from work in around eight hours and am willing to help you out here. I struggled with those trophies myself, because I'm honestly not too interested in PvP at all. 
---
That's not griefing.
---
My buddy and I play on PC
---
You could put your cool gear in there to be “trimmed” by higher-level players who have paints and plans you don’t. Drop in a few caps and they’ll be happy to ~~take that off your hands~~ help you out!
---
Damn I play on Xbox
---
Is the sun the same as the atom shop mask?  I've gotten witch, owl, soldier and toothy from a bag someone dropped.  Also, anyone have a count on the Fasnacht plans that are dropped?
---
Buy perks? What from the station vendors? Never seen perks for sale?
---
Sure thing, but you ain’t pc?
---
Still there?
---
I like that idea. Essentially it would make it so if you are playing in pacifist mode you are basically protected against griefing
---
Hahaha oh dangit! Well, in spirit at least 😜
---
There are 10 masks, and by blue mask you mean old man winter, then yes.
---
It also happens for walls 
---
Do you use burning effects? I've noticed regenerating enemies will regenerate until they have full health. If there is some sort of damage over time effect (burning, poison, bleeding, etc) then there's the potential for that to cause immortal enemies by consistently damaging them before they check if it's full health, keeping the regeneration going. 
---
That said, this definitely needs the upvotes. There needs to be a fix (either they can't regenerate more than total HP, or work on getting it to stop appropriately). Thanks for bringing this up. As a primarily ballistics player, I don't think I would have noticed. 
---
No I was referring the the smiling sun mask that the robots wear. The atom shop one is old man summer.
---
It's lag, not a bug. Whether server side or client side is unknown, but it's probably a 50% split. 
---
I just server hopped from one and the next one I joined was also nuked...it's kinda annoying....both times, people were confused as to why they failed it...if there was text chat...I would said "it's because you nuked the f\*cking place and squirrels and chickens don't spawn"
---
I've had 4 instances of nuke Helvetias now....
---
Go to the water treatment facility(?) Directly west and across the river, there's a mobile home with a computer that gives you the background/adds it to your daily quests.
---
That’s really interesting because she agroed to me I’m a crowd of about 20 when I was using a vampiric Gatling. 
---
Well shit, just ask around on this sub. Lots of people will be excited to team up with you man
---
Interesting. It seems many people just aren't posting about then then 
---
It's based on a Super Mutant.
---
Thanks, I'll assume the guy I saw had the atom shop version.
---
Your storage limit us at 800. And your legendaries are worse. Your welcome
---
0 times completed just got home from work happy to take donations on pc😇
---
You bloody well know what he means. The system is not clear, "could engage" means absolutely nothing because even level 2 players can be engaged and killed by traps. Level 5 and above could always be engaged, no matter what. It means nothing.
---
The system is badly implemented resulting in game where a lot of players complain about how difficult it is to get common resources, and many players are bent on server hopping and farming spesific locations for said resources. While the game has like few dozens on workshops that could produce all resources except maybe one, and on any given server most of them are unclaimed all the time.
---
It's just poorly implemented and you are defending it because you don't give a shit.
---
I had this issue every event. I fixed it though, I opened my map, fast traveled to Helvetia and  then walked back to the corpse and it was lootable or there'd be a disembodied leg/arm that was lootable. I had the same thing happen before at Whitesprings when a 3\*  glitched into the wall for me.
---
I probably crafted and burned 300,000+ .50 Cal Ammo for SBQ encounters in the past 3 weeks....No ban. Seem like you weren't meant to be unbanned and they fixed whatever was broken that unbanned you all.
---
56 here
---
Quilted Ultra Soft?
---
That's correct.
---
Is in the game for workshops, why not camps too?
---
I usually wind up using vats to figure out when a good time to shoot is
---
Yeah, it took me three DCs and two CTDs (PSA: For the love of the Owl Mask, take off your damn Targeting HUDs!) to finish my first. Presumably because everyone's logging on at once and overloading the servers.
---
Did you try talking to the master of ceremonies monies on the bridge?
---
I had to talk to him to join the event my friend was in.
---
It sucks that I could put over 50 rounds into her with a shotgun point blank and it register as not enough damage. 
---
To mess with you lol 
---
yes it does, it takes sometimes two lvl before you can have a perk card you want. but no other way to fix but to just do it. but the main thing I would say is start fixing the per with and idea what for build you have. if you go at it blind it will take 3 times as long to accomplish the same thing. 
---
because all of the accounts that was suspended last week got released 4 days ago, only to get suspended again.
---
That's cool, I think you should have to be apart of the Enclave or BoS possibly though, or at least get the blueprint from them. OR find them VERY rarely in military locations. It only makes sense. 
---
Buddy of mine plays 76.  He said he just got used to going everywhere over encumbered.  I own it on ps4 and xbox for a total of $40 between the two.   I don't recall every making it out of character creation.  I hoard EVERYTHING
---
Upvote for GW2 crewe :)
---
They didn't call him Small Dick Johnson for nothin'.
---
Wow, great work!!! Thank you very much
---
Can you get all 10 right now
---
TY I can confirm that it is there.
---
Old thread, but the most obvious one is the one outside Flatwoods on the intersection of hwy 86 and 86B. there is a HELP sing made with wood planks on the roof.
---
The first time I did the event big boy died and his corpse just stood there like he still lived. He was completely inaccessible for me, no container, nothing. Just a body standing there like he owned the place.
---
The second time? Everything worked great. No problems.
---
Some ppl have issues, some don't, weird world we survive in.
---
I am sure some just are not spawning yet, they can't all be that rare. 
---
That's where scaling comes in. Given the number and level of players they can spawn in a certain number and type of enemies. They already do that, if you have the entire server at the event you'll have a giant mass of enemies, but it's not enough and they die in a single hit to high level weapons.
---
caus its a hell of alot easier for immature shitheads to get a console than it is to get a decent PC
---
Read all the patch notes and road map at Bethesda's site. 
---
I would love to have a no Fatman zone for the event. Funny hit it's usually the lower stat players who seem to think it's funny to Fatman everyone at the end when the sloth spawns. Oh well, such is life
---
47 year old. Bought the game with copies for my kids so i can play with them when they are at their mums. Its funny we have survived life so yeah we often know alot more than people think.
---
Running through story on second character and it's still bugged, lol
---
While you can't nuke the forest you can nuke just outside the forest and part of the radius of the blast zone will be in the forest.
---
You crafted 300,000 rounds of ammo and didn’t get banned?.... some people picked up like 10,000 rounds of ammo from their friend and got banned
---
Good shit
---
I’m 32 and plan on gaming forever. The ages I see give me hope. I told my wife I’ve been gaming since OG Nintendo and it isn’t a phase. She has come to terms with this 😍
---
Also sausage recipe and beret
---
Any idea where I can find the Old Fisherman's Hat?  I rock the regular and would love an alternative.  Thanks for the list, good work!
---
We eat concrete now? 
---
Not bug. Lag. 
---
Maybe that’s how you make donuts 
---
Since its been answered pretty well, 
---
Happy Fasnacht and good luck on your adventures~
---
Thats gunna sting coming out.
---
Yeah true.
---
Not funny
---
It happened with my stash. I sorted junk by weight and took out heavy things, and every so often it would jump down to the third item.
---
Sorry no
---
Two-shot does slightly more damage if you hit with both shots, because 125% nominal damage means 136% damage after the damage resistance calc, while anti-armor works out at 129% damage. However, because two-shot wrecks the accuracy, anti-armor is probably better in almost all practical cases.
---
Thanks :)  Haven't found those ones yet myself, though I'm sure they'll turn up.
---
Looks like one hour
---
ahhhhhhhh
---
Oh really so ever hour it comes up
---
Oh is this serious? 
---
Yes, Mined Lead and Farmed guns for steel. My wife gathered acid and cloth for gunpowder. Used Super duper perk with about 30+ Luck (Day Tripper/Luck bobblehead/Happy go Lucky perk/ Scorchbeast Liver), Got a double every time I crafted 180 .50 Cal Ammo, can usually make 20K a day .
---
That’s just incredible that Bethesda didn’t accidentally ban you
---
Dude youre seeming lucky to me, still hunting for the ribbon pole at 31, only 2 witches and 3 tooth man. I think im on my 7th or 8th owl lol. I do have the donut though, but not the sausage
---
My brother got it first try. I just got a witch mask. :/
---
Well, I don't think people who don't care about other players and they loots, are suddently by this post, to start to care.
---
Sir,  please subscribe to r/fo76filthycasuals.  Your stand up attitude and unique perspective would be highly valued in that subreddit. 
---
He said explosive shotgun, not TSE. Instigating or AA explosive is quite better.
---
Does anyone know what the weird black texture on the front is supposed to be?
---
Ahhhh nice and quilty
---
Beats me, I did the event like 13 times and only have 5 different masks.
---
I’m pretty sure the players who do this were the same kids that would wreck your sandcastles and knock down your blocks in kindergarten. 
---
2kool4skool
---
Wasn't a joke, it was a legitimate question.
---
+karma yes, sir. I have found that using the time in between to gather Steins,  eggs,  wood,  beeswax, intestines,  etc is pretty effective.  I had time to also go dump loot at Sutton station.  
---
Sounds like a plan
---
The fresh is misleading, you just need normal bourbon, even just finding it outside will count.
---
Wow, that sucks. If the repair cost is ever too high, I know if am item is stored it will get placed at full health. Unfortunately for fully destroyed items the only way to store them is to "move" the camp. Might be useful info if you get griefed more. 
---
I usually wave and do emotes to say hi and stuff, but if they talk with a mic I will too
---
I squandered your caps on plans I already had.  
---
Well, what happened was, there were two guys in the speakeasy, one was there and one came in after me. The guy who was in there was cool (I thought), was trading a bit, and emoting and whatever. The other guy was constantly following me around with a chainsaw doing continuous slap damage. I don’t know for sure if it was actually a bloodied chainsaw, just my guess, because his health was pretty low. I figured I could take him so I just swung at him, but he didn’t take too much damage. Retrospectively he could of had on some unyielding or bolstering set, at least something of the sort. Keep in mind I have a lvl 45 anti-armor shishkabob, I run all three maxed gladiators, and I hit him with a power attack. He must of had like, 30 health I honestly don’t know how I didn’t kill him. Anyways, grabs my junk and we go back and forth for a bit. Finally get one on him with a rocket launcher, grab my stuff, then, bam, other guy from before comes out of nowhere and finishes me off. Oh well. Should of gone with my gut
---
Except berets look like a castrated ballsack.  
---
It's got to be! 
---
Hmm not bad.
---
Just recently took my first selfie with the military pose. It was okay on PA. The way it's used there, along with the mask, is pretty nice.
---
Also, if you are on pc, I would love to see your set up. I always like coming across endgame players camps (they are actually artistic rather than a barely functioning cabin)
---
I know the donuts don't spoil but thats about it, also lemonade gives a small ap boost I think.
---
Everything is a chore in this MMO.  Have you learned nothing? Farm craft repeat 
---
why did it get fucking deleted
---
Welcome. I also hate some of the patches as they are quite large.
---
Cringe post of the day.  
---
The issue is how do you handle the fact that there's high levels who will be farming it with TSE weapons without going full SBQ on it and ruining for lowbies?
---
Don't lie to the man! I am level 67 and I am still having problems with the squirrels.
---
I'm sure their dad probably drinks 8 Pickaxe Pilsners and griefs their camp just to "toughen them up." It's a vicious cycle...
---
the no loot on the megasloth has happened to me twice tonight.....
---
It’s so wholesome to see somebody who is considered old talk about their time on the thing they love 
---
Dahmn
---
Survive? Tame a death claw? Go on mighty adventures with friends? Hunt wanted criminals? Treat it like Minecraft and build epic buildings? Try to hold onto the munitions factory?
---
There are a lot of things you can do. If you are tired with the game's built in fun, start trying to take advantage of the new aspect, the online interactions. I have the feeling you haven't tried to take down the SBQ yet, so maybe join up with a raiding party to experience a nuke. 
---
That's how they work I believe. The cores are super dense energy. Generator is more like regulator.
---
Mmm, donuts. 
---
Saving my atoms for that one
---
Think it’s called jester fam

I'm not trading there, the last post was yesterday and I've just replayed to the person who has proposed some item, in a polite manner. **Do not witch hunt man. \^)**

You're very welcome

Turning 30 in a few weeks.

Remember the episode of Friends when they turned 30?

Pretty sure it's a design decision. Stealth's essentially a buff to solo rifle builds to get them through the game. If you want to do good damage to the queen with a rifle build then you'll have to get a bloodied handmade like everyone else. 
---
They are just super rare, saw one yesterday so they are still around.
---
I was thinking the same the other day and finally since beta saw one. It was kinda cool to be honest. 
---
Agreed. They advertised them a lot in trailers but I never see them
---
Whippersnapper!
---
There are 4 shops on the bottom floor of the  whitespring resort  that sell apparel. You can find the Old Fisherman's Hat and Brown Fisherman's Overalls there.
---
Mainly explore. There’s so much on the map to check out, I’ll just look around, find an empty area, and go walk around to see what I can discover. You can find some interesting side quests that way. Also, there’s the fasnacht event going on now. I haven’t had a chance to check it out yet, but it looks really fun and cooperative. You can also play nukashine roulette. Just drink a vintage nukashine and see where you wake up. You might find a place you’ve never been before. Just make sure to have some PA or a hazmat suit and plenty of health and ammo. 
---
Thanks for the tip. I think i knew that but i haven't tried it in a while. Problem is,i get do meticulous about how my items are placed that it would just be more hassle than it's worth up re-place them.
---
Man... my parents only humored me for one TI-99 game (some soccer game). Other than that thye mostly thought I was on the computer too much (they still do think that) and that I should go out and play more (and they still do think that).
---
The 50 booze is for a daily challenge. That's too much. Everyday they are putting drink X amount alcohol. And it's generally 20-50. I saved a bunch of alcohol last week because the challenges were all about alcohol, but discarded some. There's no room in the stash to be keeping this much stuff. If it was a weekly, great. But 50 daily, they are just trying to limit atom rewarding
---
I certainly hope it's not a design decision. That would make no sense. No other Fallout/TES has been this way. Stealth builds were always workable. And the fact that it's spotty leads me to believe it's somewhat broken. 
---
On PS4 unfortunately. Although, i was thinking about making a post with more pictures and stuff just to show off the whole thing, so I'll add a link for it to this one when i do.
---
Save as a blueprint? I'm kinda meticulous too (that chemistry table has to be in a corner, aligned and against the walls, but not glitching through the walls, for example). Ik they can be a bit of a pain too, but it might make it easier. Then again, it's also ready to hit "repair all"
---
There’s so many things to do. You haven’t even gotten close to end game actuvitues
---
🤚 46
---
Only when I use energy weapons though.
---
I think ive seen 3 and they have all been in charleston and they end almost immediately.
---
Tried with burning and non burning, makes no difference. Sucks because I have good energy weapons and cant use them.
---
😂
---
I think that the water purifiers should provide N of each water type. It sucks up dirty water, boils it, and filters it. You're just taking into each phase.
---
More importantly don't use explosive/area weapons.
---
The job is to protect the robots, not kill them yourself.
---
Will post as soon as possible my friend.
---
Try the new nukashine quest and the new fasnacht parade
---
Dont go accusing people of being cheaters without any kind of proof, thats just rude. We all (legit players) hate cheaters but that does not mean every player that experience problems with the game is a cheater. 
---
My wife bought me the game as an early Christmas gift, but because of school I only recently started playing. Kinda glad since it seems like they fixed a lot of bugs. 
---
Also next week the new pvp survival mode comes out
---

Fair point lol
---
Well I guess that's kinda cool
---
Check out r/fo76filthycasuals. I’ve found some cool people to play with there. I’m on Xbox, or I’d join up with you myself. 
---
Also wouldnt other weapons cause this aswell?
---
No other Fallout had other players in it. I'd guess that in a playtest, melee players got frustrated because their stealth sniper buddies were killing everything before they got to the action. So now if the target has another non-stealth opponent closer than you, you don't get the stealth bonus.
---
I think they should buff base ballistic weapon damage and nerf stealth, but I doubt it'll happen.
---
Bruh. If you figure it out send me a line. I've posted this before. And would very much like to know
---
*pulls out sparklers*
---
Turns out my .ini actually isn't changed at all, so I'm not sure what the problem is.
---
But they're "free" Atoms, it's not going to be super easy. It's a game and they want to make money. 
---
Did the parade three times tonight. Someone nuked the second parade, and it was still going for the third.
---
Not much in the way of flux in the area, but there’s a small variety - managed to get violet, cobalt, fluorescent and yellowcake flux. Not the hordes of enemies at the parade (an over abundance of supermutants suiciders, mostly) but you can get glowing ones over at arktos and supermutants at horizons rest.
---
Throw in bluetooth.....shut up and take my money!!!!!!!
---
So do you just Sever hop
---
No that was all on the same server.
---
Just make sure to put your bulked items in your stash. Scrapping all junk in your inventory will just break it back down again. Hopefully they’re going to fix that soon. 
---
Well, here's hoping you never have a "derp" moment and have someone like yourself throw a bunch of backlash at you because for it. ;) Good talk.
---
So did it take 3 hours?
---
Here they are :) [https://imgur.com/gallery/AtomicShopPoseBundle](https://imgur.com/gallery/ttqoBub)

reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a84tc6/heres_how_you_can_get_all_civil_war_era_outfit/
---
Lol, fingers crossed, seriously.
---
Part of what limits the number of players on the map is this: locked syncronization.  It's why you sometimes see client side loot before a body container syncs.  It's why being on discord with a buddy you can see their character react almost lag free.
---
It's a bit of a fragile thing (try factoring with a multiplayer buddy on a laggy connection or underpowered computer) but I has the very effects of which you speak.
---
I confirmed the West-tek one after the 8th time in there. But the buses in watoga can you narrow it down. I tried looking in a few but took to long.
---
'Murica 
---
Yup, but the parade itself, including gathering resources takes up most of that time - figure 15-20 minute cooldown between parades. Also, because it’s new, plan on half the server showing up and the highest level enemies to match the 250+ guys that come with their TSE miniguns.
---
Faschnacht Festival Event.
---
How does that interpet binary? Binary into 16 bit unicode isn't exactly how you make jokes like this. 
---
Do you have the original bits.
---
You laugh you lose
---
I didnt accuse you, please show me where I did, otherwise your being hypercritical accusing me of something.
---
Streamers/youtubers were happily showing how to dupe and it was a legitimate question I asked if you had been banned for that reason. I dont know why you were banned, fairly or unfairly.
---
It wasnt a joke, I wasnt accusing so settle petal.
---
Its all been about leveling and making builds in your characters then nuking whitespring as a high legendary farm.
---
Great looking camp!
---
I lost my shit at "burn him, burn him, burn him!" :)
---
On a related note. Don't nuke the event. Low levels quest in the area, and it messes with the event.
---
Yeah, no. It's definitly them, not you.
---
Its a week long event, take your time and enjoy it. Its not about getting eberything one day.
---
The Faschnacht Parade Event.
---
This would make sense. It's what I am suspecting and believe I am noticing. Although, I could have sworn it acted differently in an early version, but I can't be sure. Still don't think it makes it any better though. I don't want to be able to do 90% of the game flawlessly, then seriously struggle on the baddest boss. I like a challenge, but this negates my play style entirely. 
---
yes, you just have to start the quests yourself if you wanna do them in your own order but you can start them anytime and in any order you wang
---
Fuck
---
Can confirm TY for that one. and only took me one try
---
You've tried the Atomic Shop?
---
lol I ask for help when I need it. That's even why I'm on reddit to begin with. There is a HUGE difference between asking for help, and refusing to ask for help, and then returning a game because you're too proud to ask for help. And then saying all games should have pop ups every time you're over encumbered because you...don't ask for help? 
---
Great talk. 
---
Did the parade three times tonight - someone nuked it for the second parade and it was still going when the third started up. Other than the hassle of using radaway all the time it’s about the same experience. Mainly because the highest level enemies show up anyway to match the 250+ players there with their TSE miniguns.
---
Oh and don’t linger to gather supplies while the nuke drops.... you’ll have to leave and go back, so you lose 5 minutes of supply hunting .
---
Sadly I've already done that for hours on end. Thanks though!
---
Yes, whenever you place an atom shop anything on an item it has this symbol. 👍
---
Only seen them for mini gun or Farman
---
Only weapon paint jobs are from the atom shop. There is a lever action paint job in the atom store now, but hasn't been a combat rifle 1 yet.
---
The monster mash one is receivable
---
Fair point 👍
---
I have one of those with anti armour and explosive. Pretty fun gun. Jsyk you unholster those significantly faster in 3rd person
---
Ah damn, sorry. I wish they opened it up to modding like they said they would so people could add more.
---
I'm in the exact same boat as OP. Suspension lifted, played until today, 4:8:2000.
---
No email from Bethesda.
---
Also getting a weird error from Bethesda launcher: "Fallout 76 failed to launch due to an unknown error. (2.19.740.16.10.2583) error.gameLaunchScanRepair.
---
Tried repairing the game 3 times, nothing helps.
---
priceless, I did the same but I cought it on time, I started walking away to my camp and 2 minutes later it dawn on me that I was just moving my own stuff lmao 
---
Thanks.....I will check again. Might have missed it. Probably need to get the eyes checked (I am 51)....... lol
---
42 and I'm the same been playing from beginning I'm on xbox Gt mikeeparks if I'm on hit me up I love to help and play in same age group and older lol
---
Just a coincidence. If you want to be angry at any1, be angry at Bethesda. The event clearly wasn't ready to be rolled out (yes I'd rather it be out then not at all. But that's not an excuse for them to put time sensitive events; only 6 days, that don't work properly). The event takes forever to load in all the decorations and NPCs. They should just be there all the time, rather than spawn each time the event starts
---
Nope just the brewing and parade. Also if you didnt know you can go back to the brewing robot daily to learn new recipes
---
Do you have a link to that? That sounds hilarious 
---
Cringe-level rant. 
---
Welcome to the fuckin show.. 
---
33 in a few days...I try my best to cut back on swearing but it never fucking works
---
All good. It's in the featured part (and skins). It's a western style lever action, with polished wood, gold and engravings/inlays
---
Clearly not, if you're on here bitching like someone who desperately needs validation...
---
But do the shoulder lights work? I want to buy the "bright as F" mod for all three lamps on the armour and have enemies freeze in their tracks with burnt out retinas!
---
Yes it would have been an issue. because when it suddenly dropped and I don't have the ATOMS for it, I'd be shit out of luck if it's a limited time item.
---
Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much, mate! Now it's clear I won't really miss anything new that I might've wanted to buy -))
---
No sadly. I saw it while scrolling on Facebook. And I’m pretty sure it’s a non English YouTube server. So I’m not even sure if I could translate the names. 
---
Again, thank you very much.......👍
---
43 here, and i am playing since the first fallout (those geckos lol)
---
TY for that I confirmed it there and added to the list.
---
Ok.
---
We get out of vault at 2.
---
No Problem :)
---
Same thing happened to me on Xbox tonight. The guy just stood at the end of the bridge giving the thumbs up emote. It was super annoying.
---
Listen to holotapes, read notes, and explore. Its a greate way to get a sense of a story
---
Seneca Rocks visitor centre? That was a fun encounter for me. Opened up on some mid-level ghouls thinking it was going to be a cruise, and then the ravenous wendigo ran around the corner. Survival instincts kicked in hard. Had to kite it around a car for a while.
---
Chances are that it won't work and you will have to store it. The problem is the hit box that allows you to walk up any foundation. If you place small objects inside this invisible slope, you cannot move them unless you store/scrap the foundation 
---
Dang, I want more. I've sunk 300+ hours into this game and absolutely loved it. Guess it's time to finish off New Vegas.
---
I've always thought: why can't they have PLAYER CONTROLLED Vertibirds in the game eventually? 
---
I know it would be a lot, but there could be a quest line involved to get a crashed Vertibird back to operational status. 
---
This could then be piloted by 1 player and have 2 gunners and 1 passenger. 
---
It is how you make the donuts! That and quite a few other ingredients.
---
some time ago i blew up a whitespring base and had an 80 cap bounty on my head, no one came for it for hours until my friend got online. 
---
instead of inviting me to team and saying hello he decided to chase me down and take the bounty. i’m fairly good at avoiding people and i didnt know it was him at first so he had to fast travel back to me several times before getting a chance to shoot.
---
first i killed him, then the mysterious savior revived him, he killed me and he died right after again. most fun i’ve ever had in pvp, would get a bounty again just for another fun fight like that
---
I'm hoping they're just bugged and they'll fix the drop rate, cause if they force us to do the event 40000 times I'll do it but I'll be crying inside. 
---
Yep...my tricentennial edition paint PA currently has this symbol too.
---
Props to you for still playing the game after 2 band and your stuff being taken 
---
It would be cool. But it would need to be balanced to be fair. 
---
Maybe be chance based to either heal the limb or force the use of a stim 
---
Someone needs to make a poll to find out the average age of Fallout 76 players.

On PC you can make a macro that spams E. I've been using it to vacuum loot rooms and cook my food. 
---
ty bro but it is not help too =(
---
Its always fun hearing the horror stories, meanwhile i never have this issue. The bots were glitchy enough as is and the people were relatively chill. I found the worse thing was the people that just sat around waiting for everyone else to finish the setup or the ome who woried about the lvl 30 1* enemy instead of the wolves.
---
New stuff is coming out. I've been waiting months for all of this content. I can't not play it. But I can dislike the creators.
---
Waiting for content or not after that much time to go through this bs I'd be gone 
---
There's no way to tell when you look at the event on the map how much longer you have. A lot of people are server hopping hoping to get the event, so it's not surprising people aren't just looking at their maps waiting for the event to pop. It sucks you had to do it alone, but I kinda doubt people are sitting there looking at their maps for 10 minutes waiting for it to be almost over before getting there. 
---
 My first one, I had literally no idea what I was supposed to do, as the quest would not activate for me until it was almost over...and there were people just crouched not doing anything the entire time, but fortunately there were enough people to get it done anyway.
---
I cannot find the “Crap Shot Mouth to Finger Poop Shoot” Event!   Help please!
---
I wonder if any legit dupers accounts got rebanned 
---
also that really sucks man
---
How much for the 2 shot assulault?
---
This happened to me today! Found a legendary protectron in Watoga but it had no stars. The name started with Legendary though. All I got was one lead scrap. No other loot. Quite disappointed.
---
Very intresting, however rather difficult to pick if you are also needing legendaries.
---
Have they released any details on how the  bounty system works? 
---
For me if they make it so I get a bounty for killing players I won't be playing. But if the bounty is for only destroy8ng there camps I probably will.
---
Strange. I run all of those things and can’t 1 hit a scorchbeast.   In fact it usually takes two hits to kill a ghoul unless I catch them with a sneak attack.  
---
Wonder where your misunderstandings come from. 
---
Nah fam, it would be funnier to call it Harbor Freight Drill of Fury.
---
I got a Fasnacht Beret from it. Haven't really seen anyone mention it.
---
Absent-mindedly lockpicking safes near workshops, three times. Twice there was a player nearby who needed no encouragement to one-shot me (TSE shotgun, super sledge). I got a tesla rifle plan from one of the safes, so it worked out ok for everyone.
---
The other time we were begging some poor guy to kill me over the mic. He eventually did, but missed a shot, hit my friend's base and became wanted himself. He rushed out of there and we never saw him again. Probably thought we'd tricked him, but in fact we were all clueless noobs.
---
Sry i had to upvote it lok
---
Can scout armor drops as legendary? How many stars?
---
Lever Action skin is def in there, bought it myself.
---
NAR Repair Yard in Cranberry bog. It's always in the large shed, on the middle shelf of the middle cabinet at the back of the room.
---
even if it was an Atom Shop thing, I'd buy it....sit it out front of my garage.
---
Players will play. Whether its against "social standards" or what. I dont pvp bc theres no incentive to it. *Woohoo i killed 4 people no i need to wait for someone to kill me and take 200 of my caps* the new survibal mode will take most of the negative pvps away from base game. The lack of pvp is what really hurts 76 putting such strict rules in place is ridiculous. 
---
ty I was able to find it. Added it to the list.
---
is almost 2 different games from the lunch until now. yes the devs are doing a great work on listening to our feedback
---
Worse, only few are good looking.
---
No its not. Its a bug and needs to be addressed as it renders energy weapons useless
---
Damn... this thread is full of old farts. Like me. (53 this year). 
---
tht would be great, and should make it hard to complete like only when you have a group from 4 to 8 ppl. 
---
I got the Owl mask and the plans for the decoration strings
---
I have a bloodied DCG and i can't  one hit kill a SB.  So idk how they do it. Few days, ago i encountered 2  lvl players killing everyone in whitesprings including me with DCG. I tried to kill them but seems my TSE pump didnt do damage at all on them. Also they had a bounty and it wasnt showing on the map. I just ignored them and switched server. 
---
I have a spare hunters longcoat but I ain't selling it for less than 2500 caps 
---
It is not working yet :(
---
C'mon Bethesda, I need to farm those new masks.
---
I tried yesterday and didn't work for me.
---
Oh ok
---
Oh man, the best Grahm rescue I ever had was when a scorchbeast attack my workshop. I realized I was too underpowered to fight, so I slowly sneaked back into the wooded area so I could just make an escape.
---
Then out of nowhere, Grahm busts through the trees, shouting a warcry about it being a good fight, and starts waylaying on the scorchbeast, driving it away from the workshop. I was cheering so hard! LOL I ended up following him a ways down the road and captured a few pics of the fight. Hands down one of my favorite experiences in the game.
---
Thanks. Looks like the parade event started like hour or two after I stopped playing late on the evening on the day it was supposed to come, and I was really wondering have the postponed it because I expected it to come morning on Bethesdas timezone.(late noon here)
---
Oh well Ill have time.
---
Routinely happens at White springs. Purposely seek diseased ghouls out before they run to the turrets camped out back or get stolen by a golf club stealth player camper.
---
Same Problem 
---
The best of all is, i‘m a german Streamer on Twitch... My streams are saved for 30 days... Last bannwave bugthesda give a fuck... all my „cheated“ ultrazit.50 was crafted while i stream this Game... i Senf Bugthesda all saved streams... they don‘t care... spend &gt;200€ in Atom Shop... they don‘t give a fuck
---
I can confirm it and thanks for that.
---
In the same boat. I got rid of anything that could remotely get me banned again and here we are again. I really enjoy playing, but this is terrible. I’m glad I got to play the few hours of the event that I did. 
---
They’ll be crushed in Survival when they can’t get close to instigate a fight with me especially with their 20% health and this thing called armor penetration. You won’t see that build for long then. Hashtag SniperBuildLife
---
If you're on PS4, come yell at me about the foibles of my generation (I'm 33) and I'll give you some duplicate plans.

Funnily enough, that is exactly where I found this one!

IIRC, it was just west of the main town

Can confirm it breaks - you can't gather intestines from nearby creatures as the area is no longer hospitable to the average beaver :(

One thing about us old fart .. we are more forgiving. I posted a message and was told to fo for a "made up issue". What did i do, well i can thank the person and apologise for wasting his time making him read a "made up issue" in reddit. I am just either too old to get into an online argument or just forgiving OR just plain too old to understand I am not an elite gamer to talk the talk.
---
Are you sure it's EU servers issue? I don't see people making topics about it and everyone seem play well
---
Spoiled meat, lol.
---
It starts when you talk to the Master of Ceremonies
---
I play with a 71 year old Vietnam veteran every morning. He kicks ass on xbox.
---
There is a missed step between 2 and 3, you need to go to the "crashed airplane" in the mire and get a nuka marketing password from the luggage underneath.
---
without this step 3 will give an access denied.
---
Also a good idea to go look for the pedestal, and give it plenty of time to load, it took a while for me once.
---
EU players are having this problem since yesterday in all platforms. I hope they'll fix it soon.
---
You can’t choose, but they generate randomly each time.
---
The alt that was suspended originally has been suspended again in my case.
---
All I did was log in and delete about 7k worth of aid/junk from the one toon that was above the absolute weight limit because she was not permitted to eat or drink until she complied. It was basically 'comply or die... over and over again until you do'.
---
I thought it was 'mean' but hey, such is life.
---
I considered transferring the stuff to other accounts but I was hesitant to do so because that might get those accounts suspended too?
---
There was quite a bit of math involved in making sure that the I did not get anywhere near the hypothetical limit factoring in every 'manipulation' of such items as one 'cycle count' so to speak and to be fair I procrastinated too... I was having fun with the new content and I just failed to do my duty.
---
Is all well and good to say 'normal gameplay will not get you suspended' but 'normal' runs on a wide spectrum in this game and my 'normal' is someone else's 'man, you need help'.
---
Either way here we are again. My original ticket never got answered and CMs - who are under no obligation to do so - did not either.
---
Wait and see I guess.
---
They’re...challenging?
---
Yes i agree
---
Do you still play on PC and Can I get one?
---
And tick blood, yum.
---
Yes, it is. Only EU people are having problems. You don't see that much of topics because mostly of the playerbase (or the ones who post here) are from the USA, and seems that they are fine.
---
Just a heads up, the "dragon mask" is actually the Devil mask, but I do hope it's bugged or Bethesda is waiting to roll them out over time. gotta catch em' all. 
---
I just saw one guy wearing it not too long ago
---
I'd love it too but I feel like the closest we'll get to Controlling VertiBirds is probably going to be identical to how we control dragons in skyrim

I wreck unyielding ranged/melee builds for breakfast, they are super easy to kill

---
Didn't work for me, but for other people was enough to solve the problem.
---
That’s a bummer, I too like to build well decorated and cool looking CAMPs open to other players... and this has happened to me multiple times recently. It is very inconsiderate of people to annoy other friendly players like this.
---
I know it's a long shot, especially with the amount of issues with the game so far. 
---
But could you imagine VERTIBIRD DOGFIGHTS?!?
---
Pretty sure the player base would skyrocket! 
---
Oh Yes I am Italian I will try that once I have finished to download The Game if It doesn't work
---
I'm actually tempted to buy the power armour skin at this price :).
---
My first and only bounty was for picking a lock in a workshop that was owned by someone. It was my first day playing and I didn't realize that was considered stealing. Very shortly after that some guy appeared and killed me. 
---
I did have one other bounty, but that was so my brother could kill a person with a bounty for whatever challenge.  I don't really count that as a real one, though.
---
I'm just saying it's one of the first things that's really made it feel like a community in-game. I think it's neat. You are welcome to not care.
---
Or the slap damage mechanic that goes for players who don’t fight back should be the same for their CAMP items
---
Oh no - that is bad. Perhaps if you find a player at their Camp they could cook one up for you? What platform are you on? 
---
You know the slip of paper that comes in every game case? The one that says “digital manual. Read before playing” Are you blind?

I haven't reached 50 yet.  I do not want to get 1-shotted by the 900+ hours group.

I'd swap mine for an owl mask (PS4).  My boss spring extra overtime on me so I will have limited time to visit Helvetia this week :(
---
Ah, I must be distracted easily or something, I did not get to WhiteSprings initial quest until almost level 40.  I usually did every single event nearby even if I already finished it 10 times prior.  I always went and explorered any icon on the map if not previously explored.
---
I think there's a lever action one today, actually. Wooden carved looking thing. 
---
Yeah same, why first off unban players then reban them a week later? Especially players that did dupe
---
I was thinking about this the other day. I feel like they were more intense in FO4, too. 
---
Apparently I'm a youngster at 50...
---
Funny they were 800 when I looked
---
We need more wandering NPC vendors. My vote is for a Mothman who stores his wares in his wings. (Or has a mini-Mothman sidekick). 
---
What did you expect from a rushed bethesda game?
---
If you spawn at the watoga station run straight towards the the buses you see, hop the railing and there’s a singular bus that will be perpendicular to those two buses. This has a magazine spawn a stealth boy and clothing spawn.
---
Try the owl. People say it is quite remeniscing of the Mothman.
---
Looks unlimited.

I don't know who had it worse. PC who had the game wiped beta day 1 off their drives but only a patch or something at launch vs console didn't have the wipe but had to re-download it at launch. Oh and the day 1 50gb patch. 
---
Accidentally hitting a truck right behind a scorched at poseidon energy workshop.. the following explosion destroyed his turret and gave me a bounty 
---
Darn
---
They should let you rename the power armour or when you inspect it it shows you what armour it has equipped. I have 5 different power frames and I hate trying to find the specific one I want. 
---
ugh. This is exactly what I was worried to hear. I've been taking screenshots as I go to keep some kind of record of proof. I actually just spent $60 yesterday buying atoms because I liked the new stuff. im sorry friend
---
Dawn I just ran into mothman for the first time. It scared the fuck out of me. I was wandering around the ash region to get black titanium. This this is just standing on top of the hill as I turn the corner. I freeze and we just stare at eachother for a second. I was expecting a horrible fight in which I would not survive and as soon as I pulled my gun out he shot into the sky and disappeared. It was wild
---
hey can you help me learn it? I will mostlikely be on most of the day my time zone is CST and my ingame name is Dr.Venustus
---
Is that so? I'll check and tell.
---
With the current balance? Not a chance.
---
Well based on your level and knowledge of the game, you should not have had issue getting loot from the SBQ.   Maybe you only shot her once or twice before she died?  Sometimes there are min-max players fighting the queen and can take her down quickly.
---
Yes, bloodied can be more powerful when you adjust your character to take advantage of the effects.   But I was referring to just equipping the weapon without making any adjustments to your character or any perks or any mutations at all.    Like a new level 1 character (at full health) equipping TSE over any other weapon.   It just does more damage without any need to adjust at all.
---
Playing Blooding does require a bit more skill and finesse than a TSE (of course) plus adds more risk.  So IMO, it should actually be a bit better.
---
Yeah, it's bugged for a lot of people. I had to do it 4 times before the panel to enter the code would open. 
---
You can try just reloading Dome 7 itself, sometimes the door is actually just open and the plans are still there. That's rare, but if you cannot get the rest of it to work, it's worth a shot.   
---
I ended up finally getting my 7 for the dome, and I had to server hop 30+ times before I got the plans, so be prepared for a slog. It might have died down a little now that it's been a few days, though. 
---
Congrats!  I was not able to do those quests because mine got bugged and tell me to log into crypto to research the items, but I cannot do that.
---
Keep those items as well, you can re-craft them to level them up too!
---
I do the daily challenges daily, it gives me something to do everyday. After an hour or so, i can put the controller down or re-explore a location if i got em done quickly.
---
The weeklies are freaking crazy this week, not going for any except the take photos at caves. It sucks cause i wanted to buy the Excavator Paint, hopefully it doesn't go away with the parade.
---
I've gotten a mask everytime I try, I thought that's how it works
---
I've tried and it works. Thanks man
---
Instructions unclear. Accidentally milked male brahmin.
---
Bright side, now I have adhesive for days... 
---
I didn't even have to delete anything when i got back. I spread my stuff across characters to make sure I wouldnt lose any scrap if i died. I've got 3 mules with roughly 2000ish scrap across them with my main one carrying about 500 pounds of aid.
---
My original ticket only got a response because a bethesda CM elevated it. They responded to me maybe twice and since then, nothing. They just seem to not really care. All the CMs do is pop up to say "hey we're aware of this" or "thanks for the suggestion". No one ever apologised or even acknowledged the unbans. 
---
Hell we don't even know what rate food is meant to spoil because it seems to change literally every patch. In that kind of world how are players meant to know what is or isn't an exploit/exploited items. Especially given that I know factually they are suspending innocent players for seemingly playing too much while many many others are slipping under the radar.
---
I'm another PC player, and if it makes you feel any better, someone on my friends list is an actual child. He's about 6 years old, and his dad sits with him while he plays. Kiddo uses his mic and is painfully adorable, but some people are shitty because they think he shouldn't be playing. 
---
I'm a woman, which makes me incredibly hesitant to use a mic. Some people are cool, others always have stupid commentary. I don't let it bother me anymore. I bought this game dammit... the rude people can fuck right off. 
---
Don't let it get to you! Team up, use your mic; you do you. Good luck out there! 
---
Yeah once you hit a car or truck enough everything around it is doomed LOL. Can't remember if it was me or my friends, but one of us accidentally blew up a truck around the one gas station workshop and it caused a chain reaction of explosions all over. I/they got a bounty for blowing up the owner's "possessions" (the cars lol) but I don't think anyone came after us since we didn't actually hurt anyone's things and we just ended up shooting whoever had the bounty to clear it.
---
Yes, and I actually went to the wrong line after about 15 minutes into the quest and it made the quest start over....
---
Really don’t think they’ll make up for any lost sales on a *last-gen* game. 
---
I've noticed a lot of stories about lock picking items that don't TECHNICALLY belong to someone just because it's in their territory. It makes sense in a way but also doesn't in some cases LOL. The C.A.M.P. circles are pretty big really, and workshops are even bigger lol. Sometimes it's hard to tell where they end or begin (camps, anyway).
---
Ah ok, thanks for the help 👍
---
Haaaa haaaaaa
---
I'm honestly so thankful we can't drop plans haha... Or really anything that's worth hurting over. Especially when stuff like THAT happens LOL.
---
Also rip that dude. Gotta wonder who ended up going after HIM
---
Italian or other language? I'm checking if it's only an italian problem
---
Once or twice my ass. That's my only comment to that shit, no offense. Alot of rounds went into that bitch. 
---
Lvl 56 Here... you can always tell us oldies apart we the non salty ones!
---
It's awesome! We did it at the end of every parade yesterday, the masks make the photos great as well. I love it when someone on area chat starts shouting "group photo guys, come over to the bonfire"
---
LOL. That sounds like one heck of a fight for 80 caps!!! But I'm glad it was fun for you haha. More interesting than sitting around awaiting death!
---
There is such a bug dont mind it if you get reward
---
Dungeons and Dragons lets you use your imagination, government departments don't.
---
But wich time does it start? I was there 22:20 with some other players and it didn't start... 
---
I wonder if it's like the bobby pin weight and it's just a weird roll back bug. 
---
That sucks, i assumed it was duped protected. I've been on it since release and haven't gotten a dupe yet.
---
I'm ready of you are, just let me know what ones you want.
---
I hope this i just a Bug 😪 
---
I'm in the exact same boat as OP. Suspension lifted, played until today -&gt; 4:8:2000.
---
I suspect that when those accounts started destroying items, the same automated flagging system flagged the destroying of 10s of 1000s of items and then automatically rebanned those accounts.
---
İ thought it too i feel so good and amazing with a lot of people doing same quest enjoying the game together i took pics of all players after finishing 
---
I noticed it at a cooking station yesterday.  I didn’t have to find the recipe, it was just there.  It was razor grain, water and concrete I think?
---
Exactly. It's boring to see so many power armor clad people running around. But I am seeing that people are slowly catching up. PA is useless in this event.
---
Yea killing a 3* legendary and getting a drill is pretty awful lol happened to me in Watoga yesterday
---
no you can do it any lvl, im sure som eother players will show up and help you, I did the event like 3 or 4 times yesterday and the parade was always packed with ppl it was a hell off a time. i will be getting on after work on XBOX 1 around 6 hours from now
---
Remember ZORK?
---
Server issues have flared up in general. One day I got 5 dc's in an hour, and today the server booted me twice during the parade.
---
yes it sure did, was fun. I have one that i think the hole server was there, it was great but the quest was done within like 5 minutes
---
That's true enough, but I should have realized, this was right in the middle of the workshop. I think I just didn't realize yet how they worked. 
---
I hope whoever popped me enjoyed those 5 caps lol. 
---
Look on your compass or the map for stars or diamonds showing where the hoard boss is. You will likely need to travel to that indicator. Yes, it could be quite a distance away from where you started the event.
---
The Nobel committee wants to know your location.
---
its like a different game now than what it was
---
I had a bug like this and put in a support ticket so they know about it, I play on xbox
---
&gt; Everybody gets that error every now and again.
---
At about 600 hours I sure don't. I get only normal crashes and disconnects. The only error code I've seen from the game is the one that displays when you try to login when the servers are down for patch. And you only get that if you try to play when the launcher says servers are offline.
---
If anyone else gets a new code, yours is invalifrom what I heard 
---
I'm super jealous, I love berets and I've wanted one like that or like the one we see on some Scorched Officers. Haven't got a Fasnacht beret just yet, but I have seen plenty of people with em so it's only a matter of time.
---
There will no PvP restrictions, and hence, no bounty.
---
Having trouble with people slaughtering the sloth in what seems to be basically one shot, not allowing anyone at the event to get any loot. I’ve done it 3 times now and got nothing from it yet. I’ve also managed to get masks only 2 of the times and they were both the soldier. Hahaha. Fuck me, 2 of the 3 plans are the Helvetia banner also. 
---
ooooo sarcasm on the internet, cute. \*pinches cheek\*
---
I don't think they do.
---
At first I thought someone got a kick out of treating paying customers like scum but on second thought I don't think this to be the case.
---
That would require a modicum of investment.
---
You are most likely right, they simply don't care enough to even grace us with an afterthought.
---
Hey, at least someone will be getting their fill of enjoyment out of this so not all is lost I guess.
---
This game seems to set us up as tools for the entertainment of others in one way or another.
---
i saw some performance drops when I was doing the quest but 75 to 100% was in the same spot. it was glorious thing to see everytime we all at the same time fired at any monster. it was better than dropping a nuke and killing the SBQ
---
The donuts need a shit tonne of ingredients to make, though.
---
I had the same problem with the combat armour helmet, it's got a torch built in but it doesn't use it.
---
Yep that’s the place.
---
It takes 15-20 minutes for the next parade to start after one ends. I did two on the same server.
---
Try deleting that character
---
The nuke cool down was fixed a day later.
---
You could run Adamantium Skeleton?
---
I mean, it's the Wolverine perk anyway so...
---
You are guaranteed to get a mask every time.
---
I too had a good experience with the event. I got the giant mask and I wasn't to fond of it but luckily someone had gotten a duplicate owl mask and dropped it for me.
---
That has happened to my friend he was getting them at the beginning and after a while he stopped getting them
---
I saw this happen but the robots sorta teleport on the other side after a while.
---
Did you get a plan, or recipe at least? 
---
you have to keeo spaming the event, i got 4 and i did the event 3 times. I do not know if bethesda will release a different ones each tho.
---
With rifle buff, armor piercing, and explosive perks, it's pretty damn effective
---
We need more senior citizens in FO76, the young'uns are just too impatient and destructive. Beth, please throw in a senior citizen discount!
---
Well hopefully it will be yearly, so we will get the chance to have a higher level version to chase off old man winter next year
---
Level 50, tried my first run at level 45 but i got wrecked.
---
Can't you just kill him with slap damage?
---
Sack Hood (no hoses) + clean straight jacket for me
---
*Lord Dracula hates this
---
I'm quite happy actually, my megasloth moans too much and emits particles that blur my vision all the time.
---
What all changed in Morgantown? I mostly just stuck to the airport, Mama Dolce's, and the train station so I never really took an in-depth look at the city as a whole.
---
Awesome! Thanks for making this
---
Is solo gaming dead?
---
It was you then.
---
Event done 30 times, one time I didn't get a mask or beret, just the plans for Old man winter effigy. So far, I've collected:
---
Beret x 2
---
Witch mask x 5
---
Toothy man mask x 4
---
Giant mask x 4
---
Owl mask x 7
---
Soldier mask x 7
---
I think you may be right about one rare drop a day.
---
I still don't know how to get heavy legendary armor, I'm always getting the basic after level 100, Do you know why?
---
Where do you get the old ring?
---
It's the town, Helvetia, a little ways south of Morgantown near the crashed plane. Parades seem to be every hour on the hour, just be somewhere within the town and you should be notified when the event starts.
---
hell yeah gamers for life. on a serious note, I do the same all the time, i give stuff to new players to have them start on the right foot. I just tell them that I dont want nothing just that the do the same when they can. 
---
Dude, it's vault-tec, don't ask too many questions....
---
Nice! From Bumble Bee to Armored Batman!!
---
Is it rare? Nice! I got it first! Yisss
---
You pretty much just lose all your junk.
---
Same here, changing the game language to english fixed the crash on startup. I think there's probably a problem with the localization for the new event.
---
Same problem :(
---
I don't want to be one shotted by someone in full sentinel bloodied build since i'm stuck in heavy weapon build which is useless, i'll pass for now
---
Or they save them for next years parade, and all the masks we get now will be gone. Sure don't hope so, but you never know..
---
The FO universe has always had a mythical edge, especially a Lovecraftian/C'thulu mythos. Magic makes sense in it.
---
Sure. Add me IGN: jchamlin and catch me online tomorrow. I'm headed to bed now.
---
&gt; - In the end XXX. Show respect for low levels and let them them get a tag shot in. It does now spawn any unique items for the quest.  
---
I have seen his corpse flying, that's all. Too much level 200 with TSE in the event, I'm not even sure I've killed more than 3 creatures (excluding the squirrels) because the other players were on the roofs (thanks to the jump mutation) with their doomsday weapon, killing level 10 mutants at spawn.
---
Can say for certain that’s not it (all the time at least) I just got hit with it and I’ve never even been close to the massive weights or duped items, all I did was grind the alcohol quests and the parade. 
---
My junkies gamma is a good go to, especially with the alcoholic quest going on
---
I can confirm that changing the launcher language from Italian to English solves the problem. Guess we have to wait 'till Bethesda notices.
---
considering we both were level 130+ and 180+ at the time it definitely was more interesting than just sitting around :)
---
Thank you very much for your input! :)
---
It won't always drop stuff, it's annoying but it's not a bug or anything, just rng
---
I've got eight. Full excavator, t51b and t60. But then spare chassis with t60 Tesla torso, t60 reactive plate torso, t51b emergency protocols torso, t51b Tesla torso, etc.  
---
Gets boring trying to swap from one set to another.
---
We must have been on the same server. Happened about half an hour ago to me.
---
people may have different seeds for the loot. Ive done it 20 times and i have 5+ toothy  and giants, 1 owl, 1 witch
---
Its really good! It really does feel like a party that the whole town was participating in. The Helvetica spawn point was so busy from everyone server hopping to get another parade in. Limited time server wide events with unique cosmetic/camp rewards are the business! The devs have really come back swinging from the lackluster launch of the game. I feel like we're gonna look back at that road ahead blog as the turning point for the game.
---
Cool! I’m with Rustery on this one... fun idea...!
---
Don’t be bothered with all the whiners who didn’t participate in the event, but feel indignified on others behalf... 
---
They are taking themselves way to serious over an event that reorcurs every hour or even sooner if they serverhop... 
---
Besides this is within the limits of the game... if it’s possible to nuke, then why not? If that offends anyone, they are most welcome to find a singleplayer game  where they can’t run into other players...
---
You still get a cap reward for killing someone even if you initiated it but only if they attack back, to get a bounty from killing someone, you must kill them with slap damage and while they aren’t hostile(haven’t attacked back) 
---
Appreciate the clarification.
---
same here 3 account banned again
---
It spawns on a bench under a hat south of Summersville overlooking the lake west of the 87 marker on the map.
---
Love this! 
---
Being a 44 year old gamer with over 37 years experience with gaming, It's good to see that there are more of us out there! 
---
They just want us to shit bricks from the new content lol
---
Thanks I'll check it out.
---
How do you even start the parade?
---
Disagree.
---
Bloody builds are very strong, no doubt. But they pay for it. A couple of missed strikes - and you're dead. Unscrambling got under attack scorched beast? You're dead. Didn't follow the attack of a pair of robots? You're dead.
---
Bloody builds - glass guns. They are not as easy to play as you think. To destroy everything in their path, these guys pay with their vitality.
---
And yes, in PvP, these builds are not viable in principle.
---
Although, I can agree with the nerves of bloody brass knuckles, they are too strong .. The shooters are quite adequate in damage.
---
Lies and slander.  
---
Pretty sure the Flag plan took the spot of a mask reward. 
---
Don’t forget your clown suit. 
---
That would have been enough before they patched her to have massive damage resistance, now you'd have to dump a good 1k rounds into her, hence why most people have gone back to melee
---
same here, banned again
---
39 here! I love that this game has a lot of older players participating!
---
I agree, I have waisted ton on cap fast traveling to a quest, for the quest to be over as soon as I get there or a few minutes after and I do not have time to do anything on the quest
---
I would if I could get back in my excavator armor without the need to change servers because of losing that +100 carry weight
---
Unless they release a addictol syringer barrel that cures you. 
---
You'll reach a point where Wendigos become as toilet paper thin as any other ghoul, don't worry. 
---
I've got a bloodied mole miners, which isn't far behind damage wise. Full unyielding, perks etc and no, I can't 1 shot scorchbeasts either. Admittedly it doesn't take much more, maybe 2 or 3 hits even without booze/chems ( keep meaning to try that, nukashine gives a lot of extra damage ). 
---
 If they're anything like my build they'd have 45% chance to avoid any damage and 100% to avoid explosive, it's down to perks and gear. I don't have pvp armor but for that kind of douchebaggery I'd imagine they do, which will gimp your damage even more. Add in stims and chems and yeah they'll be hard to hurt. Get a gamma gun, they'll already be at 80% rads so won't take much.
---
Oooh. Didn't see&lt;3Ty!
---
Strange, I feel like it's made it way easier to buy all the plans I want.  You keep doing your 1400 per day - travel costs. 
---
Bethesda wtf?
---
What's with the double bounty rewards. Or did they remove that?
---
Yeah.   
---
Sucks there's little to no explanation in game that you need to kill the adds to get her to drop to the ground. Idunno. Booty. 
---
Now all we need is fondue!
---
Turning 30 in July. Playing video games makes me feel the same as I did when I was a teenager, playing Half Life Deathmatch with my friends. I hope I'm still playing games when I'm your age, OP. Keep on being you. 
---
As for being slow with communication, I only bought a headset for the game last night and I'm still somewhat worried about talking over it and prefer the hand signals. I'll never shoot first either, unless somebody deserves it. 
---
What's to spoil?  You do a thing, you get a thing.  
---
Don't you put that evil on me! That's be almost as bad as a radaway barrel, i don't use starched genes cause I'm farming the mutations organically. 
---
same here
---
Did this earlier. One issue was that the squirrels didn't spawn so we had to go out of the event area to get the intestines. 
---
Quick way to curb it: Revert the Claiming Change.  Allow players to protect the Workbench again...  
---
I don't do Workshops anymore due to the 'More Fair' Claim Mechanics...  I have been contested and killed within mere moments of Claiming the Workshop, by people in those lovely sniping corners.  And do they actually use said Workshop?  No... They leave and wait for another sucker...  
---
I have nothing against PVP, I understand that PVP is a part of Workshops.  I don't understand why I can't protect my Claim.  Why am I, and a lot of people, punished for taking the time to defend the Workbench properly?  It is bad enough that you lose the Resources you put in on a Disconnect, but to constantly lose them to someone whose only goal is to engage in PVP...  It makes you avoid them entirely.  I do hope they just remove PVP after the PVP servers drop...  
---
I used to have fun when someone would attempt to take a Workshop from me.  They either found little holes they could claim through, or risked the 10 cap bounty, and my turrets, to claim it.  It gave me time to actually finish what I was doing and return to the Workshop.  And if you happen to get it, and I didn't care, you were free and clear.  Close the door and it is now your turn.
---
This is great to hear. I would launch a nuke with you. I'll be your wingman anytime.
---
It spawns higher level enemies.  gitgud
---
Adventure mode. I want to complete the stories, listen to the holotapes, read the notes, and build camps with my friends and not have to worry about Wingus and Dingus taking pot shots at me. Repeatedly. 
---
Bathrobe + tin foil hat, tryin my best
---
Ive noticed this on my instigating lever max level and seems more bug like. Even with sneak and the legendary most mobs that should be dead in a single or double shot aren’t. 
---
It’s concerning. I had to swap over to my laser rifle and back up. 5 shots will only get you so far. 
---
Did your server crash too?
---
What double bounty?
---
Pray they don’t as a troll pvp survival trick. 
---
Great list, thanks! Why not put it in one of the wikis?
---
Enduring the area chat of insufferable role players is the real challenge.  
---
I ran it 3 times, and got 2 witches, 2 beret,1 soldier and 1 confetti pile plan.
---
If you're feeling brave at a lower level you could sprint all the way east to the abandoned waste dump to start the Enclave quest. Best thing about doing it like that is the Deathclaws inside the cavern will scale to your level (providing you're the first person to enter the area).
---
the areas around Big Al’s and the frat houses.
---
you sure you didnt get the armor from that legendary sloth at the end of each event?
---
Actually the server may struggle to dispense rewards. My first time doing the event I arrived a little late and I just made it to the actual parade. I thought I didn’t get anything. Damn near 20 minutes later who’s slinking around Watoga I got the event rewards. 
---
Yes it is learnable, however it is extremely YMMV RNG to learn from scrapping (but most available). It is possible to learn from a plan. Yes Dense armor mods exist and are on sale at vendors such as Harper's ferry (on PC anyway). 
---
Your other option is to hunt for known armor plan spawn locations and hope for the best from treasure maps, or event rewards.
---
That's what I did it was absolutely mental, I finished the quest somehow!
---
I wore my pastors vestments and got ran out of town. Came back in my western outfit and got grieved.  
---
No mic. I can try shouting but might annoy the neighbours
---
isittho
---
I didn't loot the sloth. For some reason, everytime the sloth is killed, it just glitches into a fixed standing pose and becomes unlootable. But if that somehow added the leg piece to my inventory then I'm ok with it. I have to try killing a sloth elsewhere and see if it glitches out.
---
Decision. Turning off the Internet.  Go into the game folder. Turn on game from exe, enter your login and pass, turn Internet on. Play
---
I would imagine not much it was duped a lot back in the peak of the duping days
---
I had to plant a second field of corn for the same thing!
---
It's made the game shit for the majority. If you can't drop 30+ hours per week and don't want to purchase weapons/armour IRL then you'll just never be competitive. 
---
It's so strange to think of the 2000 hours I've spent playing 3,NV+4 and yet I have no desire to play 76.
---
I think there are rewards also at the end because I did it 5 times in a row and didn’t hit the legendary at the end and had 3 new legendary armor pieces I didn’t have before. Can confirm I did it on a lvl 10 character so I haven’t killed a legendary before on it.
---
thanks!  will do so
---
got this in the mail from bethesday last night: 
---
Thank you for the follow up reply. Rest assured that the information you have provided has been passed on to our developers to review the game's code for a potential issue. Should an issue be found an update to the game will be released.
---
 
---
In the mean time the best thing I can recommend is to keep an eye on the official forums for information about future updates and what they address as that information is released.
---
What do you mean? I can't even enter it
---
I've been going as the [Mistress of Witchery.](https://i.imgur.com/uybbl4g.png)
---
I had healing factor and jumped off a cliff. Broke my legs and decided to see what happened. After 30 seconds, right as rain. Not sure why it worked for me
---
Red dress and party hat...
---
Could just be super rare to the point maybe some people have gotten it and haven’t said anything about it yet. But I have seen the robots wear the masks so I feel like it should be in the loot table.
---
I'm from Poland, I do have a mic and usually welcome everyone I interact with (mostly trades). In-game icons are very limited to express your needs and in some situations completely useless. Even though my English isn't perfect, I have no problems to communicate with others and it help if you want something unusual from someone else.
---
EU player here, I have voice chat disabled.
---
Haven't felt the need to enable it; the current event is the only one I have done with other people for months.
---
The few times I have crossed paths with other players before a "waving emote of acknowledgement" has sufficed.
---
I would love an 'I'm sorry' emote however. I tend to get a bit twitchy when fighting waves of enemies and I have accidentally punched other players if they suddenly 'manifest' out of the blue, however I do run with pacifist on so I do not even leave a scratch. I would just like to convey that it was unintentional and not a 'get out of my lawn' situation.
---
Same here, every time I did it I received a legendary item in addition to the item from the sloth.
---
Well they can’t see you on the map so they would have to randomly find you. Even then it’s a 50:50 chance they will try to kill you. I’d stay away from events or whitesprings lol
---
Yes! I'm betting theres a good pecentage of us that are in advancing years. 
---
I got it once. Also, my sloth is unlootable every time.
---
Hopefully the sausage has a recipe to because it gives you healing and some health on top of it.
---
What does the recipe require?
---
Got the baret after 2 or 3 runs. I didn't know it is a rare one. I rather had one of those skull or joker masks :P
---
The sloth has been unlootable twice for me, but if you stick around, I was able to loot the meat pile it left behind both times.
---
That's odd it is only randomly offering it to you, I thought it was a consistent reward.
---
thank you all for the clarification
---
you mean the junk that I would be carrying. so if I have no junk on me, I lose nothing? no caps lost when killed?
---
Not nearly as bad as the rash I got from your wife.
---
Fasnacht needs better rewards. These masks were stupid af. First time I did it was fun, it was fresh. After I saw how shitty rewards I got, I didn't even bother actively participate 2nd one. I just sat there and waited till other completed it and after that I just started ignoring the event.  
---
Your welcome. I don't know how, feel free to do it.
---
Yes it did.
---
I also care about cooking, and wish it were improved and expanded upon. Some of the recipes are absolutely ridiculous. It is a pretty neglected feature of the game right now.
---
Alrighty, my new character's fashion sense is going to shoot up 👍😅
---
39 but no fucks, I tend to keep it kid friendly, as my kids are usually around when I play. Unless it's a night session, but then no voice chat for me.
---
Gonna check that, then, because I'm sure I tagged the sloth both times with crits. I completed the parade 5 times, and got the legendary item only once.
---
Then we weren't tmon the same server. I am on PC.
---
Look nearby for body parts. If it gibs it'll leave behind a ghost image, but the loot is lying around somewhere.
---
i did the event three times yesterday and never got a legendary from the event itself, at least none that i had known about. the only legendary i got was from the sloth two times out of the three, and on the third time the sloth corpse glitched out into a regular sloth and didnt drop a thing :|
---
where do you get the clown sit from?
---
I've found its best to head to Helvetia and just server hop till its active for you. I managed to run three parades in a row last night. It was great fun and some one star weapons drop too, if you can make use of them. 
---
I don't remember all of it: Corn, razorgrain, three frog eggs, three brahmin milk, salt, and I think pepper as well. May need something else too.
---
\&gt;  Stop going around punching everyone in every event trying to start something just because you have a 1 shot build. 
---
They are doing that?
---
Man, you play with some wombles.
---
I've never seen it myself.
---
Wow your connection must be shite it took hours for you to post that pathetic insult. Just unplug the  router and modem already. 
---
I forget. I probably bought the clown outfit from a vendor or got it from a paper bag. 
---
Its amazing how different our experiences are. I claim camps to practice and blueprint stuff, along with getting camp plans. I've never had somebody claim it to kill me in nearly 600 hours gameplay. Nobody has claimed it to come kill me either.
---
There's been twice ever something that has felt like a trap at somebody else's workshop (so I've left it alone) but that's kind of it.
---
Yes, I've been lucky. I know that from all these posts I see. PC here on UK/EU servers.
---
Is there a list with the possible rewards?
---
Everthing i kown so far:
---
Recepies:
---
Fasnacht Flag
---
Fasnacht Donut
---
Mask:
---
Giant Mask
---
Harlekin Mask
---
Owl Mask
---
Witch Mask
---
Rabbittooth Mask
---
Please comment with more Stift xD
---
Fucking synths. 
---
Good to know, I'll try that next time.
---
Also, is the sloth a guarenteed spawn? I have only seen it 2/5 times, although the other times it may have been killed and I didn't notice. It's kinda sark and shady in the area where it spawns. With so many high level players running explosive weapons, it's hard sometimes to keep track of what's going on in all the noise and fire.
---
I started a new character to see how easy it was to do the whole unarmed max damage thing. The problem is there are far too many things buffing the damage, you really can one hit scorched beasts. If they land :) 
---
Damage Perks - Radicool, nerd rage, bloody mess, iron fists, party boy, solar powered, incisor, adrenaline
---
Mutations - adrenal reaction, talons, twisted muscles
---
Get yourself some unyielding armor and a bloodied power fist or deathclaw gauntlet on the trading sub reddit.
---
Take 80% rads, drink some whiskey, take some chems and you can one hit a SB
---
They are also using perks to avoid damage - serendipity, lone wanderer and some others.
---
Here's the sort of damage they can get it to (not my screenshot)
---

---
This you missed bomber jacket. Its a bos item but just called bomber jacket.
---
42 year old gamer here too, playing on PS4. Only level 37 but just killed my first scorchbeast solo. I rarely team up, mostly because of level mismatch on servers, no one seems to have a mic and none of my friends game anymore. Still having fun, have dropped many hundreds of hours into F3, FNV, F4 etc love it! 
---
I find them a lot near where the players get dropped it at. Seems kinda a bit of a distance away from town though
---
I play in spanish, I dont have the problem, but some friends have it
---
It's in the list. But tnx anyway 
---
We couldn't get them to spawn anywhere inside the blast zone. 
---
Ive been having this issue with enemies a lot lately. Almost never find a old body part.
---
You lose your level in caps each time you're killed. 
---
How can you hate molerats? It's super tasty food that sorta almost jumps in your mouth itself.
---
I went and found it. It's not bounty. It's double caps when you kill a player.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019
---
team up with other playes, or power lvl up before you keep going that what I did. whitesprings, welch are good spots to kill and good lot that will help you later on the game
---
better that getting a recipes that you cant craft because you need a other recipe first
---
nice job dude. much appreciated!
---
Oh my combat armor is better than marine armor ??? :(((*
---
 I found a way to overcome the problem ... it's difficult to call it a solution.
---
This is look like Fallout 4 bug when Bethesda update "Fallout Creation Club" and  mods,
---
Now they update atomic shop and pop up on "press any button to start" and game crash.
---
 workaround:
---
1. turn off internet connection ( this what we needed in online games right?),
---
2.  go "....\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76" and run Fallout76.exe,
---
3. After you can input login password you can turn on internet 
---
4. now you can play normally -\_- 
---
Yeah I missed a legendary because some selfish... person... ran in and meleed it with a few bits before I even got there.
---
I have a bloodied build and with sentinel or Cavaliers armor the low health is not an issue at all. For me it's very easy to play.
---
Headset messes up my haircut. 
---
Assassin sentinel marine with +1 special stats on all pieces, added with certain perk card sets and a team of 4 with shared perks, all added with mutations... basically do very little damage to them. 
---
So it seems the servers can not handle these kind of gatherings. We haf about 10 people it got pretty laggy and crashed.
---
Seen it in almost every parade yesterday. Dudes just punching everyone before and after the event.
---
Don't act surprised.  You've probably lived long enough to know people always take the path least resistance.  Stop caring so much.  It ain't healthy. 
---
I'll buy that extra beret off you or trade you a mask or plans you don't have. ;)
---
LOL You werent at whitesprings 2 nights ago on PS4 were you?  THere were 3 of them running around just killing everyone in their path. One twat just sat by my brown bag which had a fair bit of junk in it and waited for me to come collect and then one shot me. After the second time I snuck up on it jumped off a roof on to his chameleon stealth grabbed the bag and ran like hell. It will be nice if Survival mode means this idiots will leave the PvE servers, but i doubt it. They are more likely to stick with what is easy than actually face a challenge against other PvP players
---
I have done the event with bigger groups and it doesn't lag most of the time (except maybe when the radtoads spawn) and got only one disconnect.
---
I have a bloodied setup and ot can one shot scorchbeasts. It's no misunderstanding. 
---
Well that's good to know. I was running, jumping and hiding for no reason then. Lol thanks 
---
It reminds me the missed opportunity on New Years Eve where they wanted people to gather in WS bar.
---
Should have had that as a horde even where wave after wave of enemies try to destroy the bar
---
Instead no one showed up and it was lame as fuck 
---
Some sort of coat of arms, I think
---
Yeah, I've came back to the game after 2 months break, and was slowly doing an event for Enclave badge (didn't finished main quest yet, despite having a 80+ level). Slowly because all I have is a rifle that I've crafted myself and modded for max damage, because all legendaries I find are walking canes with +10% damage against players or some other useless crap. So it takes around 10 headshots to kill a supermutant. I don't mind I'm having fun on my own.
---
And then comes a guy, who one shots everything around and finishes the event in half a minute.
---
Not fun :/.
---
It's a rare drop from honey beasts. I've killed over 100 and only seen it twice. They need to make it a bit easier. 
---
Xbox. It was some kid and his friends punching everyone at the parade. We all just ignored them. 
---
Good job bro 
---
I love how the community really picked itself up and really started to enjoy the game, not many games can do this, it's hell over in the Black Ops/Black Ops Zombies community, which is a shame...
---
The cool guy club accepts your application. 
---
1. Don't carry any junk 
---
2. Trade most of your caps to a friend or alt because you are going to be wanted 
---
3. Equip reactive plates
---
4. Watch jerks people kill themselves when they punch you 
---
5. Laugh as you die when everyone around tries to claim your bounty even though you are the hero of the fucking day.  
---
Good idea...
---
A 50+ on PC?
---
Worth 800 atoms? Not sure. Maybe they will put the plans in the game eventually
---
Can we not damage PA/chassis if it's spawned in the world?  
---
Or does the no PvP at events thing protect this tool?
---
I can't stop getting giant masks.
---
That's what I thought it should be, but if you look at it really close it's just a weird blob of black. 
---
Binary solo.... 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1, 0 0 0 0 0 0 111, 0 0 0 0 0 0 111111.... robo boogy
---
I just wish there was better communication. I got an email saying they would investigate my case and anticipate it taking 7-10 days. That was on 1/24. 
---
I never thought about reactive plates... good idea 
---
Oh, shooting things is suddenly frowned upon?  I'm sorry. I thought we were playing fallout.  
---
Hardened radium rifle would be perfect to finish off that 20% Hp is they're already on 80% rads
---
I sell the civil war top hats all the time. Cost 1 cloth to make and get 15 caps each without any extra charisma buffs. Sell all my extra chems/weapons/armor then max out my 1400 caps a day using the top hats. 
---
Are you looking to sell it? 
---
It'd be so horrible to have ranged enemies that are strong enough to oneshot the level 5 parade bots.
---
Maybe if the bots scaled up too, idk.
---
You literally don't know enough about the mechanics of the game if you think sentinel armour is OP, full sentinels are food to anyone who knows what they are doing literally a good auto rifle with stagger or vats crits and hes dead even a good melee with swing speed. 
---
Be warned like I said they are buggy and you become wanted sometimes when they die. 
---
I got some festive streamer plans today as well
---
Or like how radworms got "fixed" but was bugged for nearly a month in a large way.
---
Or like how the Vault-Tec weapons workbench skin re-orientates its placement.
---
Or like how it took 4 months to slightly buff energy weapons.
---
There's a lot of reason's to have very little faith in them right now. Changes are all over the place. Wrong things are being addressed, while long standing bugs have been in since beta.
---
Had a 186 rush my lv80 while I was trying to build a power pylon, then of course I knew he was going to go claim it. What I didn't know is that he would beeline straight to me and one-shot me in my power armor. Weird how I can't even 1shot level 30 ghouls half the time but this guy I barely have time to target can end me.
---
His stupid ass couldn't find me contesting because I was circling a tree with third person camera....he eventually left........and then my internet went out anyway lol
---
Gives me life that I can score one now. Lol
---
Don't pretend for a second that devs didn't want us to do it. 
---
1 hour left man!  I imagine you will.  I am on PS4 myself.  Send me a friend request if you want.  Powwhackbang is my PSN.  I would suggest taking your time and exploring a lot.  There are no npc's of course so tons of stuff to read and find if you're  not in a big hurry.
---
Boomers in the house!
---
There is s purple ski outfit aswell. From the rare vendor at charleston 
---
I think it'll be fine once the event starts to cool off. As people complete their mask collections or just plain get bored of the event, there'll be less.
---
It still will be easy but you probably won't just be able to sit their in photomode the entire time by the end of the week.
---
I got one better. I am not a duper and have never duped but was banned regardless. while I was banned I started new account and grinder my way through till I was sitting comfortably again. Massive amounts of ammo and some guns that don’t take 300 rounds to kill a super mutant. Then I got unbanned on the 17th YAY! I moved everything I accumulated over the last two months to main account about 600 lbs. Three days later I’m banned again. Now my second character has nothing not a weapon not a single bullet or stimpak FML
---
Yeah, it will most likely remain that way forever unless they release single player servers.
---
Dude that fucking sucks in all honesty!
---
Yes it is
---
Do you have the normal Cooking Stove unlocked?
---
It says on the item page that it needs to be unlocked to use the skin.
---
Reactive plates. Dont even have to touch them to kill them
---
And honestly it’s not the TSE people who are ruining it, it’s the melee players with faster SS who think they’re hot shit and kill it in 3 seconds. I’ll never understand why people wanna have a dick measuring contest and ruin it for everyone else, must have some real problems in their life that they get satisfaction out of depriving it from others. 
---
I always PvP those players and take em down a notch just to show em others COULD be one shotting legendaries but don’t for the benefit of everybody. 
---
Im interested in the mirv  launcher plans how much do you want for them?
---
I'm on PS4 too! Haven't played ANY of the new material yet because I just haven't had the time. 
---
Thats why i give Bethesda my respect love it 
---
There is a event I  the mire that spawns honey beat to fight. I believe it is called irrational fear . It's a basic protect the robit from enemy's and spawns honey beat to fight. You should get some royal jelly every time you do it. 
---
Being in Europe and doing my military service before the wall came down made the dark humor of Fallout very much darker.
---
I have a clear memory of when the Russians had a big, unanounced manoeuvre and I thought, "Oh no! They're starting WWIII and I'm going to miss out on the great party I'm going to for the weekend."
---
I think this is just about the most genuine and realistic post-apocalyptic depiction I've seen.  
---
The Best and Brightest went into Vault 76 and after a couple of decades in confined conditions and under a strict regime they got out into the Wasteland and *everyone just went completely f\*\*\*ing bananas.*
---
Quite often i've got around this with the Tesla rifle, the wendigo at the golf club gets stuck in the wall between the downstairs counter and the book room, and the only thing I can hit her with is the arc off the Tesla.
---
Can you explain it a bit more?
---
If you don't have enough caps to pay your bounty, you get a 50% reduction in damage to other players for an hour or so.
---
Without a bounty, you just lose some caps, maybe your junk(if not stashed).
---
Omg 
---
So much respect to you Sir! It's so amazing to see Seniors playing and enjoying games! I'd love to come across you one day and spend some time with you Sir. I love this post!  
---
Why should you be unsuspended in the first place?
---
That’s right
---
Agreed! It really felt... I dunno, almost touristy! Everyone was wearing crazy costumes or bright power armour. Everyone was taking pictures and it seemed like the chat was very good natured!  
---
And that music!! xD I want a Master of Ceremonies Mr Handy for my Camp! \*DOOT DOO DOOT DOOT DOOO DOO DOOT DOOT DOOOOOO\* 
---
Why did someone downvote this factual post?
---
Yeah sorry! I missed it somehow. Great list btw, thank you for putting this together.
---
Whereas there were a couple of people on my server doing the event with bounties and we left them for the duration.  The more bodies the better, amirite.?
---
It would save a few seconds still which is needed if you’re solo.
---
I have a room for unmentionable activities that I'd love to be pitch dark and it just won't be... And it sucks... 
---
Basically, this *the* darkest timeline.  
---
I sometimes wonder if the creative minds on the writing team might need some "professional" help.
---
Thanks, I must have glossed over that :-/\` but pretty sure I have the cooking stove plans already tho.
---
I saw this post and checked my account, I haven't even played on the banned account apart to see if I was unbanned, literally logged on for 1min. I was unbanned, and have been banned again today, for logging on basically lol
---
craft them, plans are cheap, and i do have to agree a baseball bat with the allstar mod and the heated rocket mods is a bad ass melle weapon, mines does 190 base damage with no perks/boost/ not at 200%. with everything active around 330, i can wait to see it when I am donefixing my perk cards
---
baseball bat with the allstar mod and the heated rocket mod, its bad ass. 
---
There is not enough damage from a TSE.  It sounds more like someone was running a bloodied build.
---
While the game is based on and built on fallout 4, it was still intended as multiplayer.  Fallout 4 was actually going to be multiplayer and that was pulled before the finished game came out.
---
We're talking about ideas to make workshops work on a PVE only servers. It's just an idea
---
After running the event all day yesterday and not seeing a single player with the jester, devil, Grim Reaper or that sun looking mask I'm convinced they're going to be atom shop items.  
---
The Witch, Giant, Owl, Soldier, Toothy, and the beret have been the only clothing I've seen rewarded. 
---
57 here, whippersnapper ;)  
---
And you won't hear anything from me at all as I rarely have a mic connected
---
Ikr, I am curious how this mode will affect popular events, bosses, nukes, etc. It will be a whole new ball game once next week's mode comes out. I am nostalgic about this mode as it will affect everyone's build. They will have to choose PvE or PvP. If there is a nuke, I really am excited to see how these bloodied builds will survive accidental VATS hits. 
---
I think a lot of people got sick of terrible legendary drops, I grinded for 400 hours and got lucky with my 3 Assasins sentinel pieces and a couple great melee weapons I traded for my BE lever, but a lot of people had shit luck with their loot. 
---
I can’t blame them for buying duped items when the game was so demoralizing with its drop rate, but now there’s no differentiation between players. You’re either an Assasins sentinel rifle build or a Assasins/cavalier melee with some shotgunners mixed in. No one fears dying in PvE anymore and PvP is fun but basically a contest of who can stand still and hold the trigger the best. 
---
TL;DR duping sucks and ruined the progression of the game and in world economy, but I get why people bought duped items because the games legendary loot system sucks imo, especially the queen. 
---
there is at least one big weapon bug, sadly i am one of the people who has it and (to me) it's game breaking.
---
all my weapons damage had dropped with 40/50% .  Bethesda could not fix it but in one of their mails they told me like it seems that the perk cards did not seem to work anymore.   not sure if your problem is related but yes, some people suddenly have problems with the damage that their weapons deal. in  my case for example, the damage from my dragon with perks is even lower than the base damage.
---
Yeah these meta builds are pretty tiring to fight. Congratulations you can move forward and press 2 buttons, do you want a cookie? 
---
Honestly I miss the crazy pvp battles back before everyone had their TSE and Bloodied builds. Power armor meant something and you actually had to aim.
---
Being in my fifties and having played paper RPGs (and occationally still do) I love this.
---
I have almost never had to worry about another player contesting my workshop.  I dont really uderstand all the conplaints myself. But its still a game mechanic.
---
why not just log off the server if you got trapped on that roof ?
---
only with one weapon? mine are all down 40-50% due to bug
---
I had this on the "eviction" daily, got to within grenade distance of a handful of mole miners and they just keeled over and I got the event reward.
---
Tbh it was the style at the time.
---
I noticed it too, camp light don't cast shadows on other camp objects like walls, doors and other objects. If you make a camp room all closed without windows and light objects it should be dark, instead sun light ignore camp object and light them all like they are under direct sun light.
---
We are in 2019, dynamic light and shadows, ambient occlusion and pbr material should be a thing, but i think is just the engine that is old and uncapable of this.
---
Even in open world i saw houses where interior lights ignore wall and light the other side of the room too, or workshops where sunlight ignore some roof or walls pieces and light the interiors.
---
This hit me more than the other bugs XD
---
Not sure if it's rare however I have picked it up a couple of times in the Appalachian Antiques myself.
---
It was kinda hilarious to be honest. That and I would just keep getting attacked if I didn’t die there so eh.
---
Builds like this and pre-TSE nerf are some of the reasons I don't bother with pvp. Anything that's one shot isn't very balanced or interesting. I've played a serendipity/dodgy unyielding build and 1on1 its basically who can hit first and proc serendipity the most. The game wasn't balanced around pvp very well. Hoping survival mode is better but assuming it will be the same.
---
I got the sausage recipe on my first go!
---
Back on day one, I came across a person in the wilderness and they refused to allow me to explore their camp site cause they thought I'd steal there stuff.  
---
Worked for me, thanks. 
---
Idk, a full cavalier Assasins set combined with a bunch of stealthboys will be a tough target. I’ve got a melee character like this and the only thing that can stop me from dropping the hammer is the stagger effect and it doesn’t happen often. 
---
But yeah if your talking a bloody unyielding build then I think you’re right, they’ll have to be incredibly sneaky to close the distance against an AA gun. 
---
*waits till morning when you wake up &amp; discover you drank Franklin*
---
49 years old and killed my first scorch beast solo last night, i love this game   
---
If Apallachia wasn't bombed, like Commonwealth, then the rad storms should be less frequent - there is no Glowing Sea, like in F4.
---
The plans seem to be pretty common, with the exception of the Sausage and Donuts. I have everything you can get except for the beret at this point. :)
---
Xbox One player, also picked it up a few times at Appalachian Antiques.
---
Yep, incredibly stupid. I was using lights and switches to create a gambling system. And it doesn't work so well during the day
---
I've had two, Appalachian antiques, top floor, across from the corpse and bed
---
This the problem with half decent consoles being so affordable now, you can buy your arsehole kid a  secondhand console for the price of an rx580.
---
I've been contemplating making a basement filled with skeleton parts once we're able to place items from our stash...
---
Supplies are plentiful? I can’t find meds or ammo for shit. Plus the vendors cap system is terrible! 
---
No armor. No weapons.  
---
Get drunk. Get naked.  
---
Fist your enemies.
---
Exactly what I do too. The map system is really lacking IMHO.
---
Idiot!
---
I never pass up a free opportunity to call someone an idiot. Thanks!!
---
Pvp shouldn't award level based caps, that system is shite
---
The Witcher 3 did this really well. Multiple icon/color options!
---
I've only seen one, in the ash heap, named murgle
---
thanks i have been looking for them.
---
Same deal. Just was about to buy atoms too
---
Hmmm havent seen that yet and I'm out there alot getting ores.
---
You don't drop the hammer like you went to law school and judged for a county for 20 years. You drop the hammer like you googled best builds and wound up with the same thing as everyone else thats meta for "best"
---
Havent seen that yet even though I'm out there alot getting ores.
---
Yeah. It's sexy af yo. My outfit already used the military cap (a beret as well) so it was an easy swap.
---
This applies to 2shot explosive players too.
---
Yeah, 3* legendary deathskull rad, that drops a regular wooden armour leg.
---
All sessions since unban were recorded not sure why the downvotes 
---
Can we just for the love of god make wet things with purified not boiled water OR have a water boiler 
---
This should have been part of the hotfix if they want the player economy to work.
---
Starting to wonder if unsuspending was a mistake 
---
Cook All would be life changing.  I use a mechanical keyboard and hate boiling water and cooking when the house is still asleep.  100+ water collects (because you know it's not one to one), 50 cooks to boil the water, then however many to cook what you've got ingredients for.   /sigh
---
Yeah if you don’t have the caps to cover your death you should be kicked from the survival server until you can farm for more. Something tells me workshop PvP might even get worse than it already is. 
---
Also 39, and this is a big reason why I PTT.
---
Wait - what?  'Splain please?
---
It's a daily that starts like any other event. If it's not active, server hop for it.
---
Considering how poorly pvp is balanced and that they're still meting out level based cap punishment for dying I don't think so. The only tempting part is that camp traps would do full damage but I'm assuming that would be pointless since people could destroy them indescriminately.
---
I feel the same, but there is always someone who takes liberties, I was on a run and someone nuked Helvetia just for a laugh I suppose... 
---
Yea while I don't disagree with a life timer entirely I think its better to just stick with a kill death ratio or kill life span ratio
---
Exactly, simple fix
---
I got 5 so not rear 
---
When it works, it is a sight to behold. I was getting griefed after a queen run, and then a horde of ghouls came at me, I pacified about 4 of them one after another, and they stopped running at me, picked up on the guys attacking me and ran for them instead, I killed the whole squad with my BE Handmade, whilst my ghoul buddies attacked and distracted them. 
---
Yeah 2/3 of the robobrain horde events at Robco result in the legendary spawning inside the wall. Luckily I’m able to vats it every 30 seconds or so and eventually kill it and it’s body sticks out of the wall just enough so I can loot it, but it’s one of those “you had one job” scenarios that breaks your immersion and enjoyment. It’s never been a problem for me since this last patch but I’m sure it’s existed before then aswell. 
---
It is a lot of fun, if you are on PSN, add me darthnick
---
Absolutely. The only redeeming feature in 76 is the UI. Its easier to navigate and the categorisation makes things alot easier to find.
---
But where the UI is a step forward, the actual building is 2 steps back from Fallout 4.
---
Played on the 15th as a recorded session and yesterday just before fashnat started but had to go to work. Now cannot enter the game a day later 
---
Most game developers find third-party programs that press buttons for you illegal to gameplay. You start automating one button and suddenly you want to automate more. Then suddenly you're cooking up your entire stash or farming a room while away from keyboard because you know the button order to loot everything.
---
This is not how games are meant to be played.
---
Same here buddy, we will see what happens 
---
I server hopped a couple of times and it was effective like half the time so it's worth a shot, the event notification comes up right away.
---

Whoa.  This reminds me of the old man in the Cormac McCarthy book, The Road.  There was a movie by the same name and the old man was played by Robert Duvall.  If we ever cross paths, I'd like to join you for a walk and a Nuka.  Maybe some stories, too.

I used the glitched sloth as an opportunity for a nice photo and sat perfectly underneath him.

I'm 53 this year and love still playing games and as I'm disabled i can't get out the house much these days apart for hospital and doctor appointments,fallout  76 has been a great experience so far only been greifed once but I find the players well behaved and very helpful.
---
Taking down a scorch beast queen with the help of others you just can't beat the feeling working together as one to bring her down is so heart warming and makes this game worth it.
---
Though, that was the beta
---
Everything you said is rather relatable, I’m tired of these bloodied build people walking up with their death claw gauntlet and cultist masks hitting you over and over again while you’re not trying to PvP, then they have too wipe you’re entire base with 2 fell swoops because you don’t fight I hope that pacifist mode is changed to not deal slap damage more than once, and disable player camp damage.
---
You're not alone... Bethesda seems to know :

I prefer the Arial spawn point myself.

I have noticed that 3\* legendaries are not dropping 3\* Legendary items, EVER! Have you reduced the drop rate, I am level 100+ and its really dissapointing to keep getting one star legendaries from 3\* , please can you look to fix this. I have my kids character just weighed down with all the 1\* Legendaries I get, and I cannot sell them because no one wants to buy a 1\* unless they're poor low level, and then the drops I get are 45-50 so i am just stuck with all this stuff. Can I scrap them with the legendary vendor when that comes out ? 
---
Your welcome 
---
Yeah but we already paid $60 for the game, I get your point but sometimes I do feel like the challenges are purposefully made in such a way that people won’t want to even try. I know the atom store will pay for future dlc but I’d rather pay $20 for a great dlc than have free content that should’ve been part of the original game anyways. I’m sitting on 4k free atoms and refuse to buy any until I see legit content that I want to support. 
---
Once you have sneak 3, shadowed armor, and muffled legs, forget about it lol. You can almost be in their face smacking them before they see you. 
---
u/Valseek u/BethesdaGameStudios_ ?surely someone knows what's going on? Especially with missable content 
---
Very true. Ever tried doing back on the beat when Morgantown is nuked? It's super hardcore mode as the glowing fatbois can one shot the bot lol.
---
I never actually fired at someone in full sentinel assasin, but i heard they are reducing too much damage to be killable
---
Yeah, I've tried that for a few of my structures, but most of them won't place as i often spend hours trying to figure out how to cheat the system.
---
That reminds me though. I've often thought that there should be a perk card that allows your camp items to regenerate their health over time, or the repair option should allow you to repair damaged items before they break at a lower cost. I'm sure this has been suggested before, but it's just another one of those oversights that frustrates me.
---
Same here but some Vault Dwellers will continue to downvote us because our mistakes. 
---
I feel you those dang molerats.
---
I've found the metal helmet and combat helmet. If I ever run across the marine one I'll keep you in mind.
---
Yeah I completely agree with you. I'm very afraid from the corrupted data message I hope I don't lose my character I have spent too many hours to lose it for an error from bethesda
---
Yes, it’s very easy to kill the Weightspring ghouls in this build.
---
Try to kill the scorched beast queen solo
---
Yes. Very much.
---
Two shot explosive weapons got nerfed to death and there are perks and armor mods that protect you from them.  
---
If a TSE one shot you, you have to change all your build and armor.  
---
Anyway Power Armor it's the worst for PvP.  
---
Please stop molesting the squirrels.  
---
Yeah great shout! Only way I know to stagger is using the perk Tank Killer. Don't think they have the staggering legendary perk for weapons anymore. I use a level 45 3* Bloodied Explosive Automatic Handmade. and a Anti Armour 3* 10mm Sub machine gun, and a Anti Armour Vats quicker 3* Level 50 Tesla Rifle.

---
The Frat house where the Eviction party is at in Morgantown. Its a white ballcap on the skeleton of the dude passed out/dead on top of the keg on the table.
---
i agree the enemies should be equal to the number of players that are in that location, i did the event a few times and most off the time I didnt even had time to tag the enemies before they were dead
---
I always wonder how people don't have enough junk. I always have oodles of everything. I gave a friend all the mats for his X-01 armor because he didn't have anything but I had so much junk I was over encumbered and my stash was full lol.
---
...also wearing masks.
---
Turn off Internet, go to C:\\Program Files\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76 and turn on the game frome  fallout76.exe, enter your username and password (dont pres enter) turn on Internet back, and go press enter
---
Me, I'm 55 as well - so I gave my game character grey hair, which I don't have IRL :-)
---
hahahahhaha great post
---
Same here. Wasn't a dupper so don't have smth. on my account to care about. Better play other games where you won't get banned for no reason TWICE! in a row.
---
the game its a lot off fun, 
---
on what are you playing on
---
Have you started the Brotherhood missions? I’m level 32 and I just started it
---
Mistakes? Intentionally exploiting non-stop until getting banned isn't a mistake. 
---
Sam's, I just stack the weight reduction perks that apply to my build, and even with an aggravating full HUD, I still only rest at 150/250 at most, if I clear all the junk out XD
---
Where is Appalachian Antiques?
---
No. Picking up Colas from a bag surrounded by an entire server. 
---
Sorry, I just did not know the whole story based on your comments, was just taking a guess.
---
I have help down the SBQ about 20 or so times, not a large number.  But never had issue with loot except the spinning cursor thing.  Eventually I could loot once the battle calmed down a bit, just need to find her meat pile then.   Maybe recently patch changed things?

 let's play !

No I haven't
---
Well, based on my prior tickets and Bethesda's replies, i.e. "we're sorry all your mods were deleted from your stash; we're not going to replace them and you're SOL", it doesn't matter if I submit a ticket because the plans won't get replaced.  I just went ahead and bought the plans off folks and relearned them
---
Seriously?   
---
I'm totally overburdened with everything from power cores to plasma cores to meds. Food and water so easily accessible I don't even know why we have the bars? Sometimes I'll run out of a single type of ammo but there's enough ammo types to rotate without ever having to worry about it. I get that the core adventure mode is supposed to be accessible to all but if a proper survival mode is coming I hope it actually feels like survival.   
---
I'm here for the brutal unforgiving apocalypse. 
---
Why does everyone always turn to the Nuka-Cola excuse?
---
Look, I will say it right now so this excuse can no longer stand: *you don't get banned for picking up things from other players' bags*.
---
I killed the mule of a duper, looted 8 million lbs in crafting materials, and I didn't get banned.
---
Now, what you probably meant is: "I used the duping exploit to sell Nuka-Colas".
---
Same happened today on the 2 accounts they unsuspended last week after a three week temp suspension. I happily got to play my main toon again, had access to the camp and cosmetics that I paid cash to unlock via the shop, even bought some more when I got back on this week. Then today out of the blue I am running the mask event with friends and poof, 4:8:2000 lockout all over again. I never got a notice about the suspension lift, nor did I get any notice about today’s resuspension, nor did i get a reply from support when I went to seek help early this afternoon.
---
Hour later I find my second account was resuspended. Funny part here is I only logged in once last week since being unsuspended only to verify my access was restored. I logged in and out, never played, traded or do literally anything with my second account leading back into this new suspension.
---
Feels like someone over there has no idea what they are doing.
---
&gt;"Duping sucks, that’s all I’ve really got to say."  
---
&gt;"It's made the game shit for the majority. If you can't drop 30+ hours per week and don't want to purchase weapons/armour IRL then you'll just never be competitive."
---
We're not talking about GTA Online here right?  Because damn does it sure sound like it.  You know, it's a lot more likely that this is just how online games of this style are now.
---
I made a few shielded vault suits a couple of days ago and used up all my gold  :)  along with some other crafting. Usually I'm full of stuff!
---
&gt; It's made the game shit for the majority
---
&gt; I have no desire to play 76
---
If you don't play, how do you know it's "shit for the majority"?
---
Just asking..
---
I think the true PVPers will have a good game finally but the griefers will remain.   I hope they eventually adjust the PVE side to limit griefing there and perhaps they will all go away then.
---
Pretty sure I did a couple runs with this group last night. Had a couple of camps set up in town. Wild setups with everything open and available for everyone to use. Good times.
---
54 here.  Love this game!  
---
Or on the contrary, they know exactly what they are doing.
---
Let's hope the bans are permanent this time.
---
I see them frequently at the Stump Cap Stash hidden behind the Flatwoods Church.  Usually about 4 of them.  
---
And there is a random road event that has a Vet Bot with a train of half a dozen cats following it.  
---
well done

Everybody loves a parade!  (Well, almost).  I had a similar experience last night, some of us were jumping around, some were walking with the robots, some were in various costumes, many in PA.  I put on my shiny pretty Tricentennial PA and joined in.  One party pooper came into chat and said something like “how can you play this?  It’s boring”.  Ignoring him, everyone continued the festivities.  I especially liked it when the machine gunners took out the nasty radtoads and the silly scorched that attempted to crash our party.
---
I got the witches mask and flagpole. 
---
No trumpets though.  :(
---
It’s all about the RP!  😉
---
Love this! At 37, I suddenly feel young... But really, this game is a blast. The other players I come across are so helpful and friendly (well, at least 98% of them) and I always do my best to be the same. Just a few minutes ago I dropped off some stimpaks, purified water, food, and a spare mutation serum at a low-level neighbor's camp. Hope that helped them out and maybe brightened their day a little. 
---
(Btw, if any of my fellow grown-ups are on PS4 and want to travel the wastes together, hit me up!)
---
Not rare
---
cool, thank you all
---
The salt in this thread is insane 
---
I had this happen to me with the lemonade vendor recently. I had to relogin several times and it finally let me purchase. There were quite a few people waiting in the area for him though.
---
Same here Beth doesn't want us to have fun or maybe going to work is the problem
---
Northwest of Watoga I believe.  
---
Well then he's dumb. That's not griefing. That's actually kinda funny. I was server hopping myself last night and died several times when spawning right in the middle of a blast zone. I in fact was on Pacifist and didn't make a big deal over it. Radiation and blast zones are part of the game. Meleeing through someone's health despite Pacifist and Slap Damage clearly isn't. Those two are completely different scenarios.
---
I mean I get why you said that about the playing 30+ hours comment but not sure why you included my duping statement? Are you saying that it’s just a part of games now and we should move on? We all have but that doesn’t mean it still doesn’t suck and ruin in game economies. 
---
Lvl 60 in real life soon. Maybe see you at the Fasnacht event one of these days and you can explain to me what to do. My reflexes are not that good anymore, but my intentions are always honorable. PSN: gefam.
---
The camp menu has them all as far as I'm aware, I've got the donut recipe too. I want the bonfire personally it would look great in the yard.
---
Same here. Finally, I was able to log back on. Played for abit. Then the parade update came on and I was banned again.
---
It won't let me reply to your last comment, for some reason.
---
So, you and your friends started selling what you knew were duped items to make a few caps and buy all you wanted? Good, the ban is deserved. Hopefully you've learned a valuable lesson.
---
Bathesda is working on an update where you take zero damage in passive mode and your camp cant be destroyed 
---
So far I've had 5 or 6, one was a recipe for the Fasnacht donuts and the others were Fasnacht decorations - streamers, flags, that sort of thing. I assume there will be a recipe for the sausages as well.
---
All in all it's a fun little event and there are always lots of players. I keep server hopping to do it again and again and again... :D

This is the best! Hats off to you!
---
Lol if they are permanent this time anyone within Europe is getting their money back
---
Really? The second sentence was too far down?
---
It's The Forest, designed for low level players.
---
I'm with you. First time playing any Fallout. Love the game love the lore on all Fallouts. My cousin got me to play he plays all the Fallouts. He got his father to play he is 72. My uncle has breathing problems and he may not be fast with the controller but you know it doesn't matter we are having fun. Age doesn't matter we are here to enjoy the friendship. Any way we play on Xbox CaptWolf55 is my handle. Have a great time. See you on the flip side. 
---
I think you can find the suit in Freddy Fear's House of Scares (Between Abbie bunker and Red Rocket Mega Stop) and it will activate the Challenge kill a Wendigo while wearing clown suit.
---
Why are you even in this discussion? Lol
---
I absolutely agree someone at Bethesda does not know what they are doing that's why you got unbanned then another smarter employee found the mistake and corrected it.
---
An Old Man Winter Effigy (big wood thingy on fire), some poles with paper lanterns and ribbons, some ribbons and streamers and I _think_ balloons. Maybe.
---
I think that's it. It's all random. 
---
Great read sir! 
---
44 here.  I don't use my Mic much unless i'm in a party with friends and Fuck is definitely my go to word.  That and the C bomb i used a few times for the fine people that won't stop trying to initiate fighting and i usually just fast travel somewhere else to avoid them.  NOTE:  Don't x-box message someone the C word, you may get suspended from Xbox for 24 hours.  :-)
---
Depending what kind of mouse or keyboard you're using. I use razer hardware and the Razer Synapse app lets me create a macro/alternate function for any key I want. The + key on my numpad spams E and the - spams R. Makes cooking/collecting water waaaay easier. I first made the macros when the duplicating CAMP item bug existed and I had to scrap 1000+ razorgrain.
---
I got a leather leg, witches mask and a recipe for the fasnacht donut from one completion award last night.
---
Marking something on your map!?! Preston Garvey wants to know your location.
---
Thanks man. If you need the wetsuit marine mask, i'm here
---
Lmao il upload my 1 play session if you want so you can see my account as it was prior to the second suspension. I honestly think we weren't meant to be back in yet as there was no news and our emails said we would be informed. I never cheated intentionally the first time and sure as hells don't want to be suspended again 
---
Yeah in way sadly, you shouldn't have to move on, but this problem extends over majority of these free-roaming multiplayer games.  I also included the duping statement because hilariously one of the original downfalls to GTA Online that created massive amounts of griefers was actually people duplicating, or more specifically in terms used by GTAO players "duping" cars to sell for insane amounts of cash.
---
I don't know, sometimes I wonder about the 76 community, nice folks, but I still remember when a a major complaint was being unable to pause the game, or being unable to just have "perk presets" to entirely defeat the purpose of perk cards and teamwork.  But yeah, there's a lot of parallels in problems between 76 and GTAO, which if they continue is a bunch of really severe warning signs of things to come.
---
It happened to me just drop something in your inventory then pick it back up 
---
I mean they were replying to my statement about duping sucking. Whether people want to admit it or not duping has made this game worse either through server instability, market disruption and/or the funneling of players into specific builds to be viable for PvP. 
---
I think you’re misconstruing the argument a little bit, they’re saying duping has robbed them of their desire to play as much because with limited time they feel outgunned and I can understand that. I still love the game even with the duping but I’m not too blind to see what it’s done to the game as a whole and understand why it might have ruined aspects of the game for some people.
---
How ever do you manage them? There got to be an easier way. 
---
Needs more and the sloth..waaaay to fast or easy to go down before everyone can tag it or even spot it. 
---
So its a very common mistake and misunderstanding that irony means funny coincidence. Like when a thief gets stolen from or something like that. 
---
What irony actually means is something taken out of it literal context, but more often than not, specifically opposite too. 
---
Simply put its when a word is used where it has a strict definition or meaning, and it is being used outside its definition on purpose, and mostly to imply the opposite.
---
But its mainly used in writing and has three forms. Socratic, Dramatic, and Situational irony.
---
Socratic Irony is more often than not the use of appearing ignorant or stupid of a certain construct to get information or leverage against someone. Like in detective dramas or in the Princess Bride the swordsmen uses his nondominant hand to fight.
---
Dramatic Irony is in tragedy or darama writing as an incongruity between what planed and what is happening, usually to subvert audiences expectations. Prime examples of this would be every Anime Romantic Drama ever (or you know Romeo and Juliet if you HAVE to have Shakespeare as an example).
---
The last (and most controversial) form of irony is Situational. This is the one most well known and misused. Because of the common misuse and the fact that even in its proper use you could more aptly describe it as coincidence scholars debate tjat it shouldnt coint or be used at all. Hence the controversy. It is used specifaclly to mark the opposite of an expected outcome and often to a point of futility.
---
Like taking the stairs because you dont trust elevators, but then you slip on the stairs and hurt yourself. 
---
The key difference to note is that you take an action for a specific purpose, which then results in exactly what you were trying to avoid. (If this sounds like every result of every wish ever made in a movie its because Monkey's Paw is situational irony in its proper use)
---
Hope this cleared everything up and feel free to ask any other questions about what I wrote. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you don't know something.
---
I was part of the post that ran the numbers on this and anti-armor is generally better than two-shot and definitely better if you mod it since two shot doesnt included weapon mod damage. That being said I think the only mod for gatling damage wise is the prime receiver?
---
I'm sure Bethesda would love to know you picked up 8 million pounds and got away with it 
---
The PvP could be harder, but more realistic. Maybe one shot kill each way for PVE. I have loads of Rad-x and rad away. But I can’t find Stimpacks for the life of me. Food is easier to find, although in the new update I think that the vegetables spoil too quickly. 
---
I’d like to be able to build camps anywhere. Including on top of roofs and on structures. I’d like to see survival similar to day Z mod. 
---
You can view them in your camp. There is also a donut and sausage recipe that I'm aware of.
---
Im not near my xbox but it should be in the audio settings, recording settings OR the headset settings. It'll give you the option to record with mic audio. It took me a hot minute to find it.
---
I appreciate this. I'm a few years younger, but have switched from mechanical engineering to computer science. I had the old sinclair ZX81 "computer" at home early on but careerwise only switched in the mid 90ies with a few years at university. It's quite weird looking back at the development. I was professionally programming iPhone apps ten years ago that had the same kind of limitations as the early programming projects. Limited performance, memory and so on. Nowadays programming in that regards is lazy, but the complexity of the whole system is enormous. New world with new challenges...
---
Yea it was awesome because of all the players doing it at the same time. There’s something extremely fun about a dozen people working together and all marching in a parade.  Then all putting on their new masks and trading them. 
---
Very Wholesome 
---
Yes, two or more is always sketchy af. One time, I had failed to lock my artillery box, so one guy raided it and started throwing flares all around my camp. I noped the hell out of there before it started raining.
---
You are talking out your ass while jumping to extreme conclusions. Quit pretending you know anyone here or their circumstances. Got to bed kiddo.
---
Mine are still showing up at 98, 102, and 87. 
---
Sounds like I got lucky. I've done the event maybe a dozen or so times, got the beret the 2nd time. Aside from that I've gotten a few plans, and the donut recipe. 4 soldier masks, 4 witches, 3 giant, 2 old man and 1 owl.
---
Pull out a Gamma Ray if you’re really having trouble. It ignores Sentinel and Assassin effects.
---
Even then, you shouldn’t have to. If you block one single hit from a Bloodied melee, you can easily get one punch in and kill them.
---
You actually can block VATS attacks for melee. Use that to your advantage. Don’t just jump around because you can.
---
I accepted their team invite and I let them come to my camp, fast traveled after the one immediately and killed him.
---
Then his buddy was loading in but he still had a bounty so I killed him before he even finished loading.
---
&gt;we can't really throttle down to please everyone. 
---
Try using a low level gun that's not explosive. 
---
It will need in the small print Warning: May attract nuclear explosions to unit when playing theme
---
Yeah I mean those other complaints are petty and definitely come from this franchise being single player up until now. I get what you’re saying but I’ll still call a spade a spade when I see it. Duping sucks, maybe it’s just the byproduct of an online game but it still sucks. Maybe it sounds naive to say, but it’s still the truth.
---
I have faith that if they can fix duping and raise  the lvl cap of gear then much of the in game economy and PvE and PvP interactions can be improved. Idk maybe that’s just too big of an ask, this is my first online game so if I sound too hopeful or dismayed it’s because I love this franchise and don’t want to see it ruined by dupers.
---
Yet another person with 0 information or insight talking out their ass while spewing whatever they happen to think at the moment. Never a shortage of that around here either a 😂
---
I checked I still have my witch outfit craftable still.
---
What’s the recipe call for?
---
It will most definitely be a disaster XD. Especially the longer it goes on. Unless they have some kind of PvP scaling patch next week when it comes out. First week should hopefully be somewhat fun before everyone starts using a black powder rifle or super sledge mid game for 1 shots. Once the legendaries come out, forget it XD.
---
Just me, or did that look like a Protectron to anyone else? xD
---
Really though - put a Garrahan Mining logo on that and it's Instant Fallout :)
---
What happends when nukes hit a place like Helvetia,, glowing squirrels spawning?
---
It would be nice if it considered the amount of players there and spawn 2-3 mobs per person. No need for it to be another queen fight but give something for people to do.
---
There is a recipe for the sausages, my team mate got it
---
Go away. 
---
Very much worth the risk of total camp annihilation, if you ask me :)
---
Ty. This whole community is a shit show.

Moon with crashed spaceship mask is called " Fasnacht Moonshine Mama Mask". It will be in atom shop Mar 21-26 after the  Fasnacht Old Man Summer Mask.

.. and sometimes other mobs will loot their friends and use their legendary weapons.
---
How do you tame animals?
---
I stop playing too.
---
The total lack of information and technical support from Bethesda about this issue is absolutly RIDICOLOUS. Bethesda shoul seriusly considering changing their job.
---
Yea there should have a wishlist of cosmetics we want to see in the atom store tbh
---
Absolutely! I think it’s viral to other robots because we had a mr prize bot join the parade too yesterday 
---
Still happen.  I got one last night at my CAMP in the Forest after doing the SBQ when I was preparing to log out.  
---
I just want the Vault Tec University jumpsuit, I can’t find it anywhere lol
---
None of my friends still play and you are throwing baseless accusations around 
---
Awesome!
---
I wouldn't mind a version of kelloggs outfit or something similar looking anyway
---
I'm 60 and have playing FO since 4 came out but since then I've played 3 and NV. I love the games. I  can relate to the OP. In fact someone did startle me once and I shot them in the leg. They took it as an invite to pop and waited me as they were many levels above me.
---
I like 76 but there are a lot of things that piss me off about it but that's for another rant.
---
That’s the thing it didn’t say I got it I had to check my inventory to change weapons to find it
---
Oh, they can come to my camp any time :D
---
Got a little surprise waiting for the griefers :D
---
ODG would be hardcore.  Especially the helmet.
---
Heck yeah borthor
---
I love you man!  You rock.
---
Very nice! Which cave? I've been meaning to relocate my camp.
---
Same; and witch mask too. They should've added a festival currency and add a mask vendor for people with bad RNG luck. So we all can complete our mask collection.
---
You know... just like in WoW, each seasonal events always have a vendor that sells the stuffs with currency. Even Guild Wars 2 have vendor and currency for seasonal events.
---
I'd like to see some actual alternate skins though, ala the 4 Horsemen skins.  Particularly the helmet, which is pretty dumb looking.
---
Pink asylum outfit plus the regular fasnacht mask. It’s a lovely combo
---
\&gt;unjustly banned 
---
lol
---
40 here. My son is 5. So no cussing out of me. Inventive cursing, though.

Only in the circlejerk that is this sub would you get downvotes for this comment

My partner is 54 and swears alot playing this game with griefers and being disconnected he has had to kill a few of said griefers  he is level 215 and his philosophy is you attack me I kill you lol if you want a friend look up seedy0000 
---
Ignore both of the numbers these people are giving because they aren't entirely accurate... AA is 50% armor penetration (not 30%) but it does not equate to 50% extra damage when you run the actual damage calculation. There are some other factors to consider as well, which is whether you have stabilized which offers 45% armor penetration and we didn't do any figuring to find out whether anti-armor perks/mods/effects stack with each other.  
---
I will say that the numbers on two shot are only guaranteed to apply when aiming down the sight as that appears to keep the bullet spread to a minimum (both projectiles need to hit in order to get the damage... if one misses, the damage is greatly reduced). There's also extra recoil and a lowered accuracy. Two-shot is a clearer winner when you have the explosive effect. If the weapon is unmodded two-shot will do slightly more damage than AA. AA from perks/mods may affect this number as well.  
---
For the most part the difference is small-ish a lot of the time and AA doesn't suffer recoil/accuracy/spread penalties
---
We were doing the parade and grahm showed up. It was amazing 
---
I believe this is why caps are to be donated to a friend prior to this. 
---
Buy the ticket. Take the ride. You’ve seen what your missing. Half the haters online never made it out of the vault is my guess. It’s a good game. I like it a lot and my friends don’t play so I made new friends in 76. 
---
I get them all out of the stash, then deploy them till I find the armour I want, then if I'm looking to change my torso type then I have to carry on deploying until I find the right chassis.  
---
It's great fun.  
---
There's no way around it though, a chassis is 10lb, a torso is 15-20lb, this run around is saving me 70-80lb iny stash.
---
Where do you even find it? Unlocked it but cant seem to find it anywhere
---
heh, I bet :D
---
Church. 
---
People constantly play this game on here where they throw down some flimsy bullshit comment to attempt to discredit anyone or everyone. They sniff around for issues that don’t concern them and insert themselves with their shit attitudes and behaviors. They pretend like they are some elite person or hold some nonexistent high ground over others. It’s simultaneously pathetic, psychotic and a little bit hilarious.
---
yup, RP makes this game phenomenal =D
---
I've had similarly great experiences. Ran Fasnacht about 4 times today. Things were pretty swell. After the parade people stayed near the bonfire, throwing around emotes, swapping masks, jumping around. During the parade the higher levels ran ahead to intercept the Super Mutant Suiciders (I'm only 56, but I was able to hold my ground). I think MOST people got a hit on the Megasloth, too (though one time it was one shotted, annoyingly).
---
It felt like the entire server showed up at one point! 20~ people. It gave me a festive feel. A great event, all around.
---
History repeats, as far as I can tell the devs probably aren't going to manage a fix, so that would be up to the community.
---
&gt;" this is my first online game"
---
Yeah, that's what I was trying to say, it seems like it is for a lot of people on here and a lot of the game's fanbase.  Not my first rodeo though, I was making notes on how the system could be abused from the very moment they showed it at E3.  Honestly I'm a little surprised some people with one shot builds don't try to run in front of other people's fire, that's a really basic move on games with PVP restrictions like this.  You act all friendly and unofficially team up with someone, then jump on a grenade they throw or dive into some bullets they shoot, whip out your player-delete gun or hammer and vaporize them, take their stuff and drop it off in the nearest lake and rinse and repeat.
---
So all in all, I'd say there's more to come, as factions and bounties are a must to tone down griefing.  I've found active factions in games really make a huge difference.
---
Just coming from someone who went into this sort of thing as a friendly stoic newbie avoiding cheating and glitching like the plague, but walked out a griefing glitching scumbag.
---
Bye
---
53 here....I really am enjoying the game. Almost exclusively single player. So far, only one bad experience with a player just trying to kill me for no reason. I just let him do it, and switched servers. My only drawback to the game is that as I level up, it seems that the enemies are harder to kill. Fights that used to take 1 or 2 shots are now taking like 4 or 5. But, I am adapting. Cheers!
---
I don't like the change they made to reactivate plates. Before it would reflect 50% of their full attack power instead of slap and one shot those little bastards. But for defending yourself you become wanted. They changed it so the plates don't respond to the slap attack. It should have been changed so you don't become wanted. Let those little fucks wreck them selves and you should be not labeled as wanted that's the change I wanted.
---
Isn't that just because they're running bloodied builds? Idk . . .
---
I have 70
---
Two shot is only really only 1.25 shot now, after a few patches ago. There are mutations for low health builds that up your damage, like adrenal reaction. Nerd rage perk also helps. And then there are bloodied rifles that do more damage the lower your health.
---
yeah, that kinda annoyed me, the Megasloth we had was a 2 star legendary, and you couldn't loot it. The corpse bugged out =/   
---
Otherwise, that event is top-notch!
---
In FO4 I ran around in a modded jacket, just coat not the outfit, and nothing else.  It looked awesome.
---
Perks + luck
---
Oh I missed the idea part. 
---
Yeah workshops could definetly improve regards to teams as well, as right now only owner can fast travel there. It makes no sense whatsoever.
---
&gt;69
---
Nice
---
Close to lvl 100 super pissed about how unplayable it is due to nothing working right.  But no. Never mind.  Your ass stat, a statistic pulled from your ass makes you right.
---
Hey OP this guy is right buy the game.  Best thing ever!
---
I think they are punishing all cheaters by not allowing them to participate in Fasnacht.
---
I'm sorry about your Dingus. I'm sure you'll find another one.
---
Was it a good shit though?
---
Forever ever?
---
Banned players are now starting "free muh boi" campaigns lmao enjoy your ban losers
---
All the players cheered when they saw him, there must have been at least 3/4 of the server there for the event 
---
That's good eating 
---
I once got a piece of armor too. And the sloth hasn’t shown up as far as I know. 
---
I called a guy a pickleboy for getting pissy that i wouldnt sell him my bos knight plan
---
Me too. I've gotten several legendaries from diseased. None worth keeping, but several.
---
It’s that way in NH as well. Our towns and cities may be small, but no matter what DMV you go to, it’s like this as well. Before I made my own character in FO76 I was watching my boyfriend play and I was laughing so hard the entire time during this quest! So accurate! The town I currently live in has around 5,000 people in it and no matter what time you get to the DMV, even if you get there right as it opens or even before, you’re still gonna be there between 1-4 hours minimum. It’s insane. And a commenter above me was so right, it’s all crackheads!!! The people who work there absolutely do hate their lives and people and I don’t blame them, they deal with some real winners...yikes. They definitely should make it a bit easier but even if they try to, it’s still a shit show. Thank god if we need to register our vehicles we can do it at the town hall. If I had to go to the DMV for that? Good Lordy....
---
Yes. MoM questline is great. And the motherload is a nice short quest.
---
Not when your overweight with Dog Food x3
---
My main character wears the wildman rags and ritual mask on a daily basis
---
Same problem here. I had an awesome boat house but had to leave it behind cause it wouldn't fit in the blueprint. 
---
Top ten anime crossovers
---
Nah.
---
Also, I don’t know if anyone here plays The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but there is a similar quest to this in that game too! But it’s at the bank! But it’s so funny and it’s the same level of frustration having to run around and get different forms, oh no sir that’s the wrong one, sorry we are on break, blah blah I always laugh at that one too!!!
---
i played the event once yesterday night! it was great all and all, but when the rewards came and i got a PILE OF FASNACHT CONFETTI, which is basically colorful dirt, it was sad! I wanted the masks!
---
SO. Props to you to for getting masks and not dirt.
---
Oh, it's a tick! Strangely they translate that too "Ixode" in my language.
---
I thought cats were dog food?
---
Yes haha it kinda looks like a protectron :D
---
Good, less cheaters on the servers. This is a happy day.
---
You should seriously consider a dictionary...
---
"BuT eNgLiSh IsN't My NaTiVe LaNgUaGe!!!"
---
save it...
---
It even has a little lid for the fusion cores! 
---
thank you, the problem is, there is nothing in C:\Program Files\Bethesda.net Launcher\games ... i can open the Launcher from there but thats it. Guess i still have to wait :( . have a good one and fun at the event!
---
Well 13 hours later I've gave up searching :( must just be a custom piece they made for the event 
---
☠Trying to make sure my fellow Vault Dwellers are healthy physically, mentally and emotionally during this ban wave crisis.
---
I don't usually go to bed at 12 AM. Maybe you are weird and you do, I don't know.
---
Hey, all I can say is that I am happy that cheaters are receiving the punishment they deserve!
---
And in other news we still don't care that you got banned. Go play Fortnite with the rest of the banned players 
---
Bought it yesterday because of digital store spring sale and the recent patch. Perfect timing. It was 60% off I think... 
---
Oh! I missed that one , sorry :)
---
Great list and nice work
---
Good...miss the content, cheater
---
Salty much?
---
Are you on PS4 maybe ? i would love to have companion with a simmilar experience (30 yo played all fallouts) . Im always very slow and  i take my time . I love grabbing everything then hoarding it then crafting tons of stuff that i will never use.
---
And you know better because?
---
Sounds good! Might take you up on that later today lol. PS4?
---
Hahaha! I almost typed Helvetica instead of Helvetia last night, too.
---
They know. I sent them two videos about it to report this duper.
---
Illuminati
---
Gotta take over that Spruce Knob doe
---
lol Bye 
---
Yes, and this is clearly stated on the games packaging and in the PSN store.
---
Lol, I think we were the last generation to actually experience that. Well, that and ZORK on Trash 80s.
---
Sooo... To the point! Each day is a chance to obtain diffrent mask? Is that what You wanna say? 
---
Start grinding alcohol recipes and faschnacht, of course
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Same. The parade is a great event if it wasn’t for the other people there. 
---
And why are you? 
---
Never cheated intentionally? Either you cheated, or you didn't. It's simple as that. 
---
EU serfdomU
---
Sorry but not today. For now i'll follow you and i'll contact you when i'll be ready to play
---
The Inspector Costume with a random Fasnacht mask. It's probably cheating, since I almost always wear The Inspector costume. Maybe I'll dust off my Patriotic Vault Boy duds, tomorrow?
---
To provide a different perspective.
---
You know, the base of what is considered a *discussion*.
---
Someone nuked Helvetia during the Fashnacht Festival yesterday. That was interesting. 
---
Sure thing, just message me on XBL.
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
The Event was Failed because all the robots got destroyed because nobody cared about the bombers.
---
meh
---
SAUSAGE PARTY!!!!!!!
---
Definitely I'd love to see that level of survival. Do we know if they are allowing for characters to be transferred? I really hope not. If it's going to be more brutal then it seems to defeat the point if you can just move your character back to adventure mode. 
---
Medieval Paul
---
Yep, I've got one in my stash box I want to try out along with a gamma gun.
---
Player interactions in a MMO...who would’ve thought?  
---
That's fine. I'm rolling around in PA on that toon right now anyway so. The underarmor is just cosmetic. 
---
Are we still talking about the cheating dupers? sigh
---
Was totally doing that earlier. Found this guys base and wrecked it. Had a 900 cap bounty and showed up to the event like nothing happened. He was not amused. i was rolling on the floor. LMAO
---
Sorta yeah, a party of four blasting @ a combined 20 dmg/sec, could take someone out pretty quick, especially if they are a bloodied build.
---
I was given items by a player when I hadn't long got the game. Didn't know duping was a thing and was naive to be honest but was alas banned for it 
---
Only after Bethesda took over. FO 1 &amp; 2 at best had unique weapons, which were just improved versions of weapons with no magic abilities. There were jokes like the Holy Hand grenade and Diablo Thorn armor, but no mass produced magic (i.e.legendary) weapons. 
---
While FO 3 and New Vegas were good, Bethesda is now well on the way to ruining FO.
---
The blueprint budget is much smaller than the CAMP budget.  My CAMP is two blueprints that snap together, one uses the full blueprint budget the other uses about 90%.  Collectively the two of them took up under half the CAMP budget *before* they readjusted the way turrets and lights effect budget.
---
Got it for 10 dollars. I was like you, I am still in doubt. I do love exploring, and reading, so even if it's a mess, it is still appealing to me. 
---
Also, from what I have seen, they do take steps in the right direction. I think it will be better later, and you might be able to buy it for less than 10.
---
My game did not download fully yet, so I do not
---
 know if I will be disappointed or not, but for 10 dollars... That's nothing.
---
Quit playing the fucking victim card
---
Happened on the server I was on on PS4 last night.
---
The victims aren’t interacting, just being assaulted. That’s what makes it griefing.  PVP implies that both players are playing, not one is playing and the other is just trying to escape. 
---
Hahaha😂thats a way better reason to call someone pickle of. i called him pickle boy cuss pickle was part of one of their names and Aim was apart of the other one's name.
---
I keep finding more and more confirmation that they dont seem to know what they are doing the more I read around and talk to players. 
---
Seriously sorry to hear your massive current state of limbo. Hope it is all resolved quickly.
---
I got the exact same mask and plans. I got shots in on the sloth, but I got the spinny yellow arrows of fail when I tried to loot it. Do you feel like you contributed a lot to protecting the parade?
---
This is wholesome. I love it. All the best buddy! :D
---
&gt;No one ever apologised or even acknowledged the unbans.
---
No need to apologize when they did nothing wrong
---
&gt;Especially given that I know factually they are suspending innocent players
---
Sure they are champ 
---
If nothing is working right, then how did you level up?/s
---
Which just like started, and will be restricted to running a week only.
---
So basically anyone playing Fallout 76 is doing the parade. 
---
Also, they all breathe air and have arms. That's not exactly noteworty to say.
---
My guess people falsely assumed they were not banned anymore. Actually,  I was under the impression that the change to overweight mechanism might have been the fix Bethesda wanted to implement, prior to releasing the bans. Maybe someone found a way to circulate that fix, causing Bethesda to rewoke the bans.
---
Is there no workaround? Switching the PS4/PC to English?
---
Shout out to all the OG’s! 
---
Not old gamers... the Original Gamers!
---
If it's anything like Fallout 4, the headshot damage miltiplier is x2.
---
thanks bro 
---
Or accidentally pressed the "unban them".
---
I for one love cooking in f76 I'd really like to be able to plant tarberry and other plants so I can grow my booze- I mean cooking repertoire.
---
Apparently that does work
---
We can actually had someone pass out protest signs at one of the parades I did afterwards, and we all ran around and smacked each other with them. It was pretty fun. Then when the lvl 5 protections would spawn we would all descend upon them (with the signs still) and then go back to slapping each other with cardboard. Good times.
---
Also, idk if anyone else has been doing this, but every group I've done it with has fired into the sky for the first leg of the march until the radtoads spawn.
---
Overall a pretty fun event, for the event itself and the people involved. I got a really good picture of one group, it's now my favorite loading screen. If we could post photos I would share it with you guys lol. 
---
Had a Guy shooting mini nukes all over the place , was a mess with exploding cars and what not. Crazy and messy and tbh it was fun !
---
I heard the event in question is super boring and unchalleging! I imagine the more leet players are simply bored and showing off their tricks in front of a crowd! 
---
I've had the same occurrence as well, two separate occasions, although the first time he died after the super mutant bit by a bit of friendly fire methinks
---
Zzzz 
---
My heavy melee stuff all does over 350 damage. Explosive definitely isnt the problem with instigating and  bloodied weapons either.
---
Try getting better gear, or asking for some help getting better gear. Do not expect me to dumb things down for you and carry around a level 20 pipe rifle to please the princesses. Would you like to charge us an admission too?
---
Not to take his defense or anything, but I do believe that as long as the message is understood, the purpose of language is achieved.
---
I think it's just mean to direct people to a dictionary just because of some misspelled words. 
---
Still, maybe the world needs a little bit of mean in today's time. 
---
I drank nukashine few dayis ago. I woke up at lake. Next to me was this fisherman hat, ranger outfit and ranged hat. When i looked on lake, there was two skeletons and fisherman outfit.  But because of hangover i can't tell you which lake it was, also i drank another nukashine right after.
---
You may have wood stove instead. 
---
I like that idea, also why can't purified water later become boiled water. I can do that right now, with my Brita filter and a pot.
---
Same problem all italian player.
---
Please new hotfix today
---
genius, have you ever consider that also children are playing on console and maby a child do not speak english yet?
---
Actually is a post for help, you ain’t helping are you?
---
Was it a level 43, because it might have been me then. I was doing the event around 6 last night, it was a lot of fun imo.
---
Like Doomfist would say: "and stay down".
---
Cuz I came here to help, not act like a prick.
---
46 here. I came across a group a few weeks ago of mostly older fellas playing, all in their 50's, 60's, even one guy who's like 71-72! One has like 16 grandkids! These are the only people I play with now, they're a lot of fun. There's a few younger people, one lady who's probably in her 20's, and one kid that's 13 or so.
---
Any other excuse you might want to try?
---
I have it set on english since i bought ps4. Didn't even notice ahah.
---
I'll confirm the balloon drop.  I got that one.  
---
Didn't you just say it was a discussion?
---
It's pointless for OP to ask for help to other users. If he /she is really interested in getting help, instead of getting attention, maybe it would be best to send an email to Bethesda.
---
I was on my level 25 shotgun build. Just got my full set of t45 and took over the Charleston Junkyard. He kept trying to take my workshop, a level 66 bloodied build. I kept one shotting him. So satisfying. Then he put on his power armor and gave it another go. I still kept killing him. Having the right damage perks makes all the difference.
---
Hey do you want to team up and do a White Spring run ohh wait you can't your banned what too soon.
---
That must have been what came through my camp the other day.  Greenish fog with radiation?
---
Are you receiving an error message popup and if you are what is it ?  
---
Perhaps characters loading in with high inventories, deleting mass quantities to get within limit, followed by a spike in paper bags being dropped, in the mad dash to move stuff between characters, resulted in the recent stability issues.
---
So they reversed course to restore game stability.
---
Get banned for bullying players who dont want to play pvp!  This game is a community play, so if a player does not fight back, move on to someone wh does!
---
*Ooh, he said the v word!  The v word!*
---
Lol what a child’s reply. All you are here doing is bullying and talking shit bud. Get a hobby. Unless this is it?
---
Maebe childrun ken yoos uh dikshunaree
---
Sorry that you didn't like my reply.
---
Anything else you wanted to add, since you were the one talking to me for mo reason whatsoever, apart from getting my attention?
---
Thanks for the tip might have to redesign a little.
---
I honestly don't know why it even has a seperate  limit because you can never build bigger than the camp budget anyway
---
I didn’t use the a word if that makes you feel better. 
---
Changing the console to english affects all other games on the playstation. I have also a child too young for speaking english, why should I waste al his games for Bethesda mistakes? And also why should I convert all my ps4 apps in english when I paied for a full localized game?
---
it's once every hour and you'll get a big notification in your top left hud letting you know that it's starting soon when the next one comes up
---
You’ve got literally every answer for everything. Think we have met before... is your name Know It All by any chance?
---
I don't know yet, but it seems what I posted above is all that could drop today (As well as some random Fasnacht decoration plans). I would guess Bethesda either made an error, plans to release more masks over time, or the other stuff is so rare as to be almost unobtainable. I finally got my beret, which I think was the "rare thing" right now. I must have done the event 50 times tonight, and I never saw anyone wearing anything but the beret and 5 masks I mentioned. Everyone was claiming that was the same for them as well.
---
Dupers back in the game.
---
I'd recommend the squirrel stew and scorchbeast diet. Great for stats and xp and doesn't take much farming.
---
Anything else?
---
People stil cry about PvP? I get it, it's annoying and frustrating sometimes, but it's a part of the game.
---
We don't really blow them up. If we were that bad the event would end really fast.
---
Have you sent a support ticket to them regarding this?
---
I legit love this game so much! You’re story is pretty feels worthy too. I recently found out I’m gonna be a dad which is awesome but I’m super excited and nervous, it’s so good to escape into Appalachia after work 
---
It is definitely fun with alot of players 
---
Is this for the login unauthorized users error or something else?
---
Feel free to friend me if you are on PS4.  It's the same name as my Reddit name.  My wife and I play together all the time (we are approaching our 50s so we are old timers as well).  
---
Were you on PC last night? Same thing happened to me and the dude was happy about fucking up the event. 
---
&gt;!The part where you make the sausages for the event!&lt;
---
Just turned 49 here.  Us old folks need to take over!!!!!
---
This build exists since the first day and it seems they're not in a hurry to change it
---
This has got to be a joke. I mean dingus69? come on
---
It is when I will only have 2 days to play it this week. 
---
Some of us aren’t rushing. Just trying to make the most of our time.
---
The Bloodied Build guys with their Unyielding Sentinels Armor are easy to kill, you just need to use the right weapon, Gamma Gun or Radium Rifle is great for this, since Sentinels does not protect against rads, and there is no auto rad away perks.
---
It's hilarious to watch them go to their PIP Boy trying to find the Rad Away before they die when you shoot them with the Radium Rifle.
---
That's fine. I'll take em. You can have the EC. If you're doing the parade event and get an extra witch mask hit me up. Call it even 
---
  But unless something has changed, it is not clearly stated in many online retailers ad copy, or in images of the packaging on said retailers web site.
---
Your weak ass bullying isn’t effective. &amp; yeah, I’m playing and server hopping mask events right now on my other accounts so sorry to disappoint ya 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Can’t believe you didn’t know that given your boundless knowledge. Weird... 
---
Yup, that was lucky. Took me over 50 attempts. 
---
If you're on xb I'll trade you for a giant mask. 
---
Nothing's really guaranteed. I've done this a couple dozen times and I've seen a lot of weird bugs. Usually it drops behind one of the trees across the street from the bonfire, but I've seen it on the same side near the church. Either way it tends to go down fast. The music dying is the cue for the spawns so I just stand back where I have a clear view of the whole battlefield and try to get a slap shot in before someone nukes it. I got a nice anti-armor cultist dagger out of it, which has made clearing out the local scorched less of a chore, but it's just mid-level one-star legendary stuff so mostly I've been farming it for wheel guns to scrap for mods. I can finally upgrade my vampire pistol! :D
---
Unless it goes Free to play (which won't happen) plus will always be required
---
If you think it's perk card related
---
 Try unplugging equipping there cards and reequipping them. Just a suggestion. See if you damage numbers change if they do go shoot something and see if it's working again
---
I’ve had the helmet for a while and to be honest it’s always a surprise as to if it will be working! They seemed to fix it previously but I guess it’s broken again then.
---
But I promise it can and should work!
---
How often is it run?
---
There is farm with more than 50 corn and that other shit you need for beer. Water is in every river. If you don't want to wait till 50beers fermentize, drink them unfermentized. Improvise adapt overcome.
---
It's only level 35-ish anyway, so I won't expect to miss any great loot if I don't get a shot in.
---
Thank you
---
Appreciate it! But I’m on PS4. One day we will have that crossplay..
---
Ran it three times last night. Masks only
---
2 whitch
---
1 Napoleon
---
1 Beret
---
What is your psn ? 
---
Your*
---
I did the event a few times and didnt even know a sloth appears...where abouts does he come from?
---
Somone got the plan for old man winter
---
See some twat going around killing people at the parade event last night with a deathclaw gaunlet just why do it.
---
All in all, this would be a perfectly fine build for anybody who takes great care to manage weight and inventory space. You’ll be able to respec after level 50, so don’t worry too much if you feel one or more aspect of your character is underwhelming. 
---
For starters, Shotguns would underperform with this small amount of STR, so keep that in mind. 
---
If you are using Lone Wanderer then I would suggest dropping Action Boy. Using both together only reduces the time for full AP refresh by about 1-2 secs, which is negligible. So that frees up some space if you want to start maximizing damage. 
---
Since you have Sneak maxed and Escape Artist, you might consider Mr Sandman as a replacement to Action Boy, which you can swap out during the day for another perk, like Gun Fu or Adrenaline, etc. If you have the unique Stand Fast chestpiece or a legendary armor piece with a stealth affix, you can drop Sneak to level 2 (comfortably if you also have a Chameleon piece or two), giving you more punch in other perks.
---
Dodgy might be less helpful since your Luck perks are geared toward VATS and Crits. Grim Reaper’s Sprint can help mitigate Dodgy as it drains AP, but I’ve found they don’t synergize well.
---
Ironclad and Evasive are generally luxuries, but they aren’t bad. Those perks might be better spent elsewhere if your play style keeps you further away from enemies and in stealth.
---
I’m sure I could ramble on, but in the end,  this game is VERY forgiving. You could pick all the worst perks and still do fairly well, to be totally honest.
---
Oh it’s beautiful! As an apparel collector I definitely need to make an effort for this :)
---
Ah I see thanks for that info.
---
I was on but it sounds like it is happening quite a bit, antisocial behaviour online means they are weird IRL, just ignore, it's not normal to want to fuck up the game for loads of people, unless they're like 11 years old of course...

If you haven't checked yet, the ribbons should be all the way at the end under "Misc Structures" (if I'm thinking of the right item). If you get any flag poles, they can be found under "Floor Decorations"
---
I am 3/4 of the way through 99, and should hit 100 tonight. 
---
I am completely confused by your comment. Although bugs exist (hell that's any new game today), there has been nothing that was game breaking. I had a group of 8 friends who all played it and got to the same level.
---
This game was the best game released in 2018 in my opinion. Yes, we all took a break. We played anthem and now the division 2. We are still coming back to fo76 though. We played a couple days last week, last night, and plan to play more this week. Everytime they release content we will be back.
---
OP, dont listen to this guy. Buy the game. Form your own opinion.
---
sure we did
---
having seen the umpteenth bug that prevents us from playing and forces us to change the language of the PS4 from Italian into English just to play by influencing the whole console. Given the new bug that removes all mutations. Considering that Tignus2099, chief guild of the Munghi Atomici was unjustly banned. All Munghi Atomici, an Italian group of 69 players, have unanimously decided to interrupt the game until all problems have been solved.

---
Where do you get just a "labcoat". I have a brotherhood one and a regular one, can't recall where I got the regular one.
---
Must have been late.  
---
PS4, I did two last night in the early evening - both were a zoo, with a mask trading frenzy after the drop.   2nd time through, somone was firing mininukes like firecrackers.  Although I did get to see a giant sloth - frozen in mid-leap postition.  Great photo op  :)
---
I saw this too and immediately thought of the excavator armor
---
Can't login either. I thought they released a patch and fixed the mule weight problem by forcing people who are overweight to destory their stuff.
---
Yep! I can confirm that! Got only one beret and a few of each type of mask for that particular day (19.03) Is Bethesda that insidious? :D I HOPE so! I dont wanna make grind marathon for that 0.001% chance to get some „rare ones”
---
Most online games shouldn't have issues with duping. It's done through glitches or bugs in the game so it should be relatively simple to identify and resolve; Bethesda was even able to tell WHICH items were the duped ones during their little purge iirc. 
---
They should separate PvE and PvP, eliminate the ability to grief entirely in PvE, and readjust the level scaling of items and zones. For one I don't like that the savage divide can scale all the way down to level 1. If a low level runs through there trying to unlock Harpers Ferry or Watoga then it makes it trivial for me to even go behind them. On the other hand, also in the Savage Divide, I set my camp up, and sometimes someone with a level of 150-200 will walk by my camp and all of a sudden I have a massive horde of Super Mutant Overlords or Scorxhed Conquerers wrecking my base. Or did before I didnmy new setup, now they have to eat through concrete walls to get to my base. In every other Fallout game there were areas that were harder than others, and it made you need to develop your character more before you ventured forth to those spots. It's that way in almost every other online RPG, I know Fallout is a slightly different class but not by too much.
---
They still have everything scaled by single player standards, and it shows lol. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game. Absolutely love it. I just think they need to go all in for the Online RPG experience, because some of the single player mechanics just aren't translating well.
---
And they've not replied to the support tickets? Tried speaking to the community managers that's in this subreddit? 
---
I got the regular one at robco
---
Game is great. Not going to stop playing due to a bug that locks a small subset of players out. It will be fixed.
---
Roger, thanks
---
Same here it also happens for the hunters long coat 
---
Opposite the church 
---
 illiterate 
---
Yep, same problem here
---
Ah Bethesda, not prepared for the online business.
---
On a funny note, and I hope you will not take it seriously, Bethesda is just trying to educate your kid in a global and very useful language. 
---
if you haven't seen yet, one of the CAMP items you can get from the event is a little bundle of balloons :)
---
Fallout 76 now contains a bureaucracy simulation, and who said gaming is all fantasy.
---
Oh no!! not bullying!! That's a mean thing to do. I'm sorry he gave you the feelz show me on this doll where the big meanie hurt you. Then we can rush you to a safe space no one can say mean things to you we'll even give you crayons, coloring books, and all the juice boxes you can drink.
---
They are probably running adrenal reaction and/or nerd rage with low health. Makes a large difference.
---
A child that does not speak English shouldnt be posting on forums anyway, because they are a child. Shame on the parent for not watching them online.
---
It comes from 2 diff directions. I have only been able to hit it twice out of 6 times I did the event. Some people are just assholes. 
---
PS4! The update download has 90 mins to go.. so close but so far!
---
I'm not making excuses it happened. I understand the situation. I don't need you patronising me 
---
Nothing spawned at all. We failed the event because we couldn’t get intestines from the small animals that are suppose to spawn. You can fast travel out of the Nuke zone to find small animals elsewhere in the forest region but nobody did it in time.
---
that's fucking infuriating...
---
Really? I've had a mask drop every time. You have to run it a few times and see what you get.
---
Yeah actually there is. All clever comments aside I pray you are just ultimately a bored, miserable troll. Either way, you might consider seeking  some sort of professional mental health help if you have not already done so. Don’t thank me later though, just pay it forward.
---
It sure did. My friend still finds it hilarious. 
---
no answer from tech support. Where's this sbreddit?
---
Life imitating art?
---
ah damn im on xbox and yes the last one was 17gb,
---
just be glad it was 48gb like they were before
---
Chally's udder must have been so chaffed
---
&gt;unjustly banned
---
You cheat you get banned. Too bad so sad.
---
You've pinpointed the problem...now you can correct it...
---
Dying for more I see. Lulz.
---
Thats from atom shop
---
The weeklies are more of a chore for me. "Get Smashed!", "Hit Rock Bottom", "Mix it Up!". Ugh.
---
But I agree, most challenges are tricky but fun. These are... Awful.
---
But free Atom is free Atom so I'll stick with it. I'm gonna need more Addictol...
---
This is super cereal don't say mean things or childish millenials will call you a bully because you hurt thier feelz
---
You are the one who invited people to scrutinize your videos. He did bring up an interesting point. Does YouTube prove you obtained your best weapons, armor, ammo, mutations, outfits, etc. LEGITIMATELY? 
---
Honestly, if you perk out damage first, and then after that get the accessory cards to switch out to, it makes a lot of difference. My first character was getting close to 50 and struggling with the enemies around that same level, but he was perked for carry weight and crafting. My new guy is perked for damage and like 5 points in critical enhancing perks so far, and it makes a huge difference. I can easily kill players and enemies twice my level, and he doesn't have any legendaries yet. So, I think a lot of this frustration can be resolved by making sure your character is good at atleast ONE damage output. Pick a weapon class and get every damage enhancing perk you can. After that worry about crafting, bartering, lockpicking, hacking etc. I'm not saying duping and griefing aren't an issue, but you don't go to battle with a wooden sword that you don't know how to swing and expect to make it home alive 🤷‍♂️
---
Well, the problem is deeper actually.
---
They have to switch their console to English, which means all other apps get switched to English as well, which mean all the other chikder games / app, a children might play.
---
The problem is not that the game in Itself is in English, but that the console is, which prevents younger users from accessing the device.
---
I do think(hope, because we are talking about Bethesda) that it will be addressed soon. 
---
if you don't know what happened don't open your mouth.
---
I was also experiencing bad internet connectivity while I was trying to do this quest. You know what made the quest go from being kinda funny to about as tedious as the real thing? Having to repeat the start THREE TIMES.
---
It _allows_ loot up to that level.  Unfortunately the lower level stuff is also still in their drop tables so the 3* can drop 1* up to 3* loot.  And 1* appears to have Higher drop rates. 
---
Kind of BS cause you are already fighting RNG to get that 3* to spawn in the first place.  
---
It's a flooring otem lik carpet.
---
changing the language from Italian to English on PS4 because of a bug in fallout76 is like reversing a car's driving seat because the window has a manufacturing defect
---
I already saw on reddit! W: Jester mask H: caps! So ridiculous! „Wait a minute I will make one for You! Hold my beer and bring newspaper and some paint!” 
---
Your suggestion has been noted, thank you.
---
you don't know what's happened so wtf you speaking about?
---
Goddam the psychos are coming out the woodwork tonight. 
---
The sloth doesn't drop max level gear.
---
People running around in team chat can’t talk back to you
---
i am brazilian and i am having the same problem :/
---
what's the problem with you if my english is not perfect? try to speak italian witout make mistakes XD 
---
James, werent you the one who made the post awhile back saying you were in contact with LadyDevann and that she said a fix was coming soon? Shortly after you posted that and nobody believed you, everyone was unbanned. I dont think it was a mistake unbanning us.
---
Yep even ask them not to before hand. Asked them to let others get a hit on it and they do it anyway. 
---
Isn’t that the effigy plan?
---
There are two old man masks though.  Red one from the Atom Shop and apparent a blue one from the event.  Haven’t seen some of the masks yet though.  Could be delayed release of rewards thru out the week or just really rare. 
---
Awesome!! Someone nuked the parade last night, and the small animals wouldn’t spawn so we couldn’t complete it. 
---
I like that grahm showed up for the parade 😁
---
Dropped from the server right before my second one reward...
---
I think I know the one you are talking about yea its pretty sick
---
just because you haven't experienced something doesn't mean it doesn't exist, every online game has griefers.
---
you know that you cant damage robots or anything your suppose to defend in event right? 
---
for example in tea time when all the little critters attack the pipes you can just throw a frag or shoot it with explosives weapons to kill them quickly and not damage the pipes. this also applys to event robots and objects. it is safe to use explosives in events and is in fact the safer way to clear the area around the thing you are suppose to protect to keep them alive.
---
a child that does not speak italian shouldnt be posting on forums anyway, because they are child.  we try to put it this way because for you everyone is obliged to know English.  
---
Yea we just need more outfits overall
---
About 1500-3000 caps on ps4 but dunno about xb1
---
(888) 739-1686. Hope this helps. 
---
Some legendary items don’t need to be max level to be useful. I can use all the spare level 5 weight redux gear in the world. Plus, this is a sloth. It drops screws. I have at least 3 more radium rifle mods I want to unlock. These take about 5 rifle scraps for every plan, and 15 screws per rifle. 
---
I'm not gonna lie, these are the best challenges the game has had for me. I think they're hilarious. I might not finish all of them, but I'm really enjoying attempting to do so
---
Speak to u/valseek or u/Ladydevann they might be able to help get an answer 
---
The textures are unloaded for the purple and the missing items is chalked up to bugs, just reload the game
---
It's very easy for you say "good bye" "it's not a problem if the game is not in your language etc." you say that because  you know english, try to put the language in italian and we will see how long you will last. XD
---
Best place to nuke so far is that building, just have make sure it has feral ghouls before you drop it.
---
Also, the capitol building, and most of Charleston wasnt destroyed by a nuke but a flood.
---
Nah this dude was a full grown adult. He fully admited he was just doing it to be a dick. Lv 200+ "what are you gonna do about it" 
---
God damn ... Its a video game. I'll just go somewhere you're not...
---
They're nothing beyond 1* legendaries. Also, if you're farming Fasnacht for screws, you're kind of doing it wrong. He's not a worthwhile legendary by any measure.
---
Yeah I was at another parade and some douche was firing nukes up into the crowd of players, he didn't live long lol
---
cheaters got banned - they aren't victims of anyone but themselves.
---
it happened to me yesterday, i was in the middle of the quest, and saw the death from above come up didnt pay any attention to where was dropping, long story short i got blown to hell by the time i got to respawn and everything the quest was over my guess. i did comleted the mission later, but hole thing is now funny, not so much when i got blown to hell by the nuke
---
Double barrel+headshot+critical. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Lol take pity on him and move on
---
Yeah. I still don’t understand how you can claim a workshop, walk away and stand at a vendor somewhere and get killed by some douche who was stalking you. 
---
That’s not pvp whatever the pvp fanatics say.  Pvp should only happen AT THE WORKSHOP that is being contested not half a map away. 
---
Yeah its the operative underarmor it clips thru alot of outfits, thats why i never use it. 
---
Please Beth consider the Italian community 
---
Were you playing during the Mothman event? They killed me so much it felt like they were camping me.
---
Like the Dead Sea
---
No clue, I use power armor, so I realized there’s no point in grinding for them
---
No. I join 20 friends back to back killing the wendigo at Firebase LT, then repeating with twngara killing the sloth there. And once a session I also clean up sugar grove and horizons rest. 
---
I still want to tag the darn sloth though. 
---
infact no child is posting here. 
---
Hotkeys? I don’t have much problem in these situations because I hotkey my aid items as well as my weapons.
---
300 a pop. If you're on the discord you can find second tier pvp gear with the damage reductions on one of the sub optimal armor pieces for as little as 4-8k caps a piece. DR/ER really are fairly insignificant and having a full set of whatever meta you're building towards is more important. 
---
And by regain them I meant I server hopped and 1 shotted a few high levels in workshops, partly out of frustration and partly to make sure I knew the mechanics first hand before I made a rant about it. It's unbalanced and by far the fastest way to make caps at the moment.
---
You win the interwebs
---
Haha.... And I did think I was old.... My age is in my character's name.... Bartie-1967.... Maybe that 's why most of the players I ask to join  do accept the invitation🤣🤣... 
---
I love the part ' I shoot you in the face' ...
---
Not without losing set bonus.
---
Nice bar setup! Love it
---
A little bit of consideration for others by the High level players would go a long way toward helping things be better for all.
---
I'm level 150+ and most of the weapons I carry will very easily 1 shot everything at the event, so I just stick close to the robots with my TSE 10mm pistol and let the lower level guys enjoy the fight, if something gets too close, I finish it off before the robots get hurt.
---
Lmao if it’s one hit, I’m bringing out the minigun
---
sorry for you but if we are more maby there are more chance to be herd
---
Not italian, but have the same problem! changing to english only made it 2sec`s longer bevor chrashing. switching to old language resulted in the Luncher to want re-install the game new!
---
30h re-installing! no thank you. i stay on english then...
---
thanks, I'll contct them
---
ran it twice.  Got 2 of previously mentioned masks, plus balloon plan and another camp plan I don't remember.
---
What I didnt see (dropped for anyone) was the Faschancht Man mask
---
Since it is in the wild (I acquired it about a month ago), perhaps thats why it didn't drop?
---
I didn’t tell or ask you to stop. I just informed you that your shit attempts at whatever this is are failing to access emotion. By all means, keep at it if that’s what gets you off. I laugh when people act ridiculous and embarrass themselves long before they’ll ever realize it. 
---
You really can’t expect people to read anything beyond a headline these days...
---
I didn't believe it.
---
Given the general animosity and ill will I thought it was a troll account using social engineering to try to further lead people on 'for teh LuLz'.
---
Don't need to know or care. I just know I'm still playing and I didn't cheat. Pretty sure those two things are related.
---
I'm gonna enjoy some FO76 after work. Have fun crying on here about how you can't play and "didn't do nuffin"
---
reactive plates    
---
in theory, it reflects 50% of the damage 
---
 **welded rebar**  reflects 10% of the mele damage 
---
One of the prizebots once handed me 100 pre war money that made me over encumbered, and then said "oh by the way, your bill of $33,692.68 is due. As he turned around I smacked him with my fore axe. Pretentious little shit lol. 
---
Innocent? On two accounts? I find that hard to belive. 
---
All those caps had to come from someone at some point. The other olayer loses as many as you gain. Any game that forces you to make the current meta equivalent of a "level 19 rogue" to go farm in game currency off of other players is like a decade behind as far as game balancing is concerned.
---
The ball clearly is in Bethesda's court for this, I agree, but as for your kid: you should make a subaccount for it, anyway, for parental control and so on. That account should have its own language settings.
---
If I were you, I'd rather change the language for now, and keep playing while waiting for that fix, rather than sulk and miss out on the Fasnacht event rewards.
---
Well, no one knows what happened.
---
Someone came on reddit and demanded a radical approach without specifying any details.
---
He responded appropriately to the level of details it was given. I am only referring to the ban portion of the post. 
---
Op said he was unjustly banned, but gave no details.
---
This guy comes he says he cheated and deserved the ban.
---
Perfect réaction în my book.
---
The amount of speculation is indirectly proportional to the amount of details given. 
---
I did. I lost at least 2 that I learned.
---
I was surprised you can do the event multiple times a day and still get rewards!
---
I believe too that blocker only works while blocking with melee weapons btw
---
41 Here.. What would impress me is a 76 year old playing FA76 just because I'm sad  ;)
---
I just hope I can make retirement in 25+ years with full use of eyes/ears/hands so I can game away on the latest iteration of fallout online at that time :D
---
bashing and power attacking eats up a LOT of fusion cores

---
Yeah i always go to silva farm on the left hand side of the mao for my corn and razorgrain, does it still work to drink the unfermented beer?
---
Although I do understand what you are trying to say(that you might know another language besides English), this doesn't really matter here. Given the fact that this is an English (at least to my knowledge) reddit, the only language level that matters is English level. 
---
Im 43 and going to be diving into the world later this week
---
Got a certificate for a car, but it expired pretty sure so I ended up bashing him with my super sledge, and dropped the note lol
---
ok the insecure little shits are not trying to be ass hats. it just at a point in this game after you get good weapons and know what you are doing in this game the only thing that matters after that is to 100 percent the game ( not really possible due to road map). so yes for me the only thing i care about in this event is the end plans and mask. the sloth is pointless and in fact i don't even shoot it but i get why they would just shoot it. they want the event over quick and to server hop to the next one. its all about the rewards. the legendary it drops are a waste of time for someone with god tier gear. 
---
I sat on top of the megasloth screaming over my mic, broadcasting "come over here!" emoticons and jumping up and down. Literally 90% of the players were too FRICKING STUPID to notice. I literally heard one guy go "wait who said that?" Dude. The one guy who did finally notice one shotted the sloth and I was like, you know what? I don't care.
---
Faction #4: Casuals who are NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON
---
I had to keep rejoining it last night on one server. I kept dropping out of it 
---
Exactly
---
i'm having the same problem bethesda pls fix
---
What would a one-War event give you?
---
"Happy Fasnacht, citizen/child/townsperson! Here's a weapon/armour/chem for your aid in this event. We know you, a normal human being, do not need these and would prefer money or a free mask, but my programming dictates I give you this useless, possibly illegal killing equipment. Have a great day and donate to General Atomics' Fasnacht Fund!"
---
It makes you think you actually got something free that could be helpful, little did I know I'd be rickrolled everytime
---
I can confirm it indeed breaks it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FS11zQkjr0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FS11zQkjr0)
---
I bet his basement gets lonely. After you hit 400lbs it's hard to get up the stairs/fit through the door I imagine. He can't have friends over either because his Mom can barely afford his Mountain Dew and Doritos as it is. He already eats them by the truckload.
---
I'm a savage to people like that if you can't tell lol. They have deep seated issues, and most of them fit the basement dwelling neckbeard stereotype.
---
A buddy and I were about to sign off last night, I think we were near Camp McFlintlock (Some distance south of Helvetia, still North of the River) and we received the message) So...maybe? haha
---
 everything that consumes pa Inside an armor will consume your battery. 
---
Me too, since this last update ive been burning cores much faster. Makes power user almost worth it
---
I think people are more upset about the fact that you demand an unban, not because of the language changes.
---
They might have been more supportive, if you hadn't had post about the free someone nonsense. 
---
Yeah happens to me too, I decided to use the perk witch makes fusion cores last 30% longer 
---
Can confirm.
---
You can actually see 'chunks' taken off the remaining charge with every swing.
---
Lights I believe - or Misc Decor
---
I saw the aftermath of that on a couple servers. Those are probably the same people that wreck your base when they ask you to trade and you don't have the super rare outfit they were looking for or won't sell them the one you do have.
---
My current camp is one the toxic river. No need for any light, day and nights. I mean, it's a bit sad and this will be among my reasons to move elsewhere one day.
---
Nah fam you pulled the crybaby millenial go to card AKA bullying. Act like a child get treated like a child. Boo whoo we hurt your feelings. Strong people don't cry and play victim you are not strong. 
---
But hey we're all very sorry we hurt your feelings. Here have a juice box and some fruit snacks so you know we're really sorry and can still be friends.
---
this is so wholesome and made my day! so glad someone with a 40 year age gap enjoys playing my favorite game series as much as me!
---
That event is dumb anyway. I don't care about the "masks" or building plans. Neither help me progress in the game. What I need is Xp and caps which this even fails to give you. So, I will pass. I dropped my two masks I picked up doing that dumb event yesterday 
---
There are a lot of little bitches whining in here.
---
Yes! If they ever introduce nodding someone should make it a genuine rickroll everytime.
---
Was it "The Toonie"?
---
If I switch language on ps4 settings it affects all accounts and all installed apps. If Bethesda doesn't want to localize anyore futre expansion of the game, I could accept this, but the can't ask ser to change language setting of their console. People who bought a ps4 didn't do to play only fallout 76
---
There are a fair number of ways to kill them though. Maxed Gamma gun will take them down quick for instance. 
---
Deal. Add me on psn my username is pirateglenn1. Payment today if you log on. Come find me and thank you for your reply.
---
Floor decor
---
Man Thats amaZing. Really creative. Where is This Cave located?
---
Same problem on ps4, i play since the beta and i’ll lose the parade, even if you try a ticket the just drive you to the general solution in their forum
---
The parade sucked for me, it got nuked like 10 minutes in
---
It took me a minute to figure out, but I carry one of each shotgun type on my character now. Combat for trash, pump action for PvE my level, and Double Barrel for the Sentinel Shithead Brigade.
---
Sorry that you are salty.
---
Get that green thumb action going too!  2 for 1! 
---
When I launch Fallout 4 from IP from my country it crashes to desktop, if I block it in firewall or use VPN everything works (well, except Creators Club). This issue first appeared about 2 years ago and still no fix.
---
I hope your problem will gain more pressure from at least it being an online game.
---
There are actually 4 spawn locations for those at the pleasant valley resort and cabins. 
---
It's your mods. Update or delete them.
---
49 and female and I have a tendency to say yeet unironically, no regrets 
---
Lol. It would be nice to have some sort of mount or vehicle. We can craft power armor but we can't fix one of the broken down motorcycles or cars/trucks littered everywhere.
---
Agree - some of the outfits combos were quite entertaining!
---
I would turn on pacifist, too.  
---
With as many people crowded around the parade shooting all sorts of weapons in all directions....during 2nd run last night, someone was firing mini-nukes like firecrackers....
---
I for one wouldn't mind riding a Deathclaw into battle.
---
3 more players here
---
(+ all which have repoted the problem yesterday too)
---
I didn't even know there were mods for this game, so that's not the issue.
---
I put It in that place where I put that thing that time is a hacker's reference. the movie not the people. 
---
Also, can the event timer stop as the parade starts please? The timer ran out as we were waiting to light the fire...
---
I dumb down my weapons so I can’t one shot, helps out the others a lot.
---
They just wanted a bounty. No big deal. Not griefing.
---
Obligatory:
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they attacking my CAMP? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want PVE  only servers and fix this broken balance. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought pacifist mode would protect me??? This is so fucked.
---
What crazy nonsense are you vomiting on yourself there?
---
(800) 799-7233 &amp; Good luck with all that.
---
Sympathy. a couple of guys wrecked my open to everyone watoga camp for the first time ever two days ago. Otoh, I then logged my sniper and PVP'd one of them seven times in a row, so I figure we're even. Sadly the second guy was in full sentinel or something and thus basically immune to damage &gt;&lt; . 
---
What is this salt you speak of? I’m just tryin to help still. 
---
PSA.... we know that you (not OP) can VATS one shot the legendary sloth at the end of the event. If you could please refrain and let at least one other person get a hit in, that would be cool.
---
God weapons?  I can't even sneezes in that things direction without killing it.  It isn't anyone's fault that they loaded this event out with low level mobs.  
---
Maybe hustle a bit if you're desperate for a one star level fifteen zealots leather left arm?
---
I order eating ass, not having mine ate 😂😂🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
I save the building on one, roof and top floor items (bed, etc) on another, outbuildings on a third. 
---
Add bloody mess and sneak. Those will up your damage but you won't get 500 u less you run a low Heath build. My lever does get over 500 damage but it's a bloody explosive so it does more damage he lower your health. 
---
Try posting this on r/Fo76FilthyCasuals . Will probably catch more attention there. Everyone is too serious here
---
Did a fight last night with 4 in our group. Melted her in 8 minutes. 3 of us with prime .50 cals and the other was a melee build. Did it during the parade and when everybody got there she was already dead. You just need the right perk cards. I get the stealth build not working it definitely sucks. I gave up on my other character until they fix it. 
---
The second fight we did last night 3 lvl 18 showed up and we melted her in the same amount of time.
---
And the way you contrast the things that matter to you to the things that matter to other people tells us all which of these tribes you’re a part of. 
---
&gt;Lol what a child’s reply. All you are here doing is bullying and talking shit bud. Get a hobby. Unless this is it?
---
Did you not reply that on another post? Keep on crying and being a lier about what you do and who you are loser
---
Worth a shot

But kudos. I've rolled to make a character that can deal more damage so I've had this bv feeling a few times too. So satisfying. 
---
Happens if you use mods or change the custom ini file for PC users.
---
Could also be corrupted texture files.  But for every item doing it it’s likely modified game files or a custom ini that needs to be updated because of the new patches.  
---
I think it lets you in the game too fast now, cutting loading screens OR they changed something else. I only know that at this point a lot of things are broken again that weren't broken before.  
---
I get my 60 frames when I load in but after 4-5 seconds, I drop to 1-3 fps for about a whole 8-10 seconds. Tested this several times.
---
The town of Welch and Camden park work well for XP around your level
---
Plus everyone rushing to tag sloth ignore the swarm of enemies that come from the opposite direction (even some leftover mininuke super mutants have made it through) 
---
Hell, the regular level 9 roamers can 2 shot him. Back on the Beat can be a challenge to solo sometimes.
---
I get concerned with splitting the player base.
---
Oh totally, I didn't disbelieve his experience.
---
I was just commenting that people who do that are total wombles.
---
Sounds like too many steins for him.  We have all been there.
---
There's a megasloth in the Faschnacht event!?!? I did it like 4 times and never saw it.
---
I think you can sell them and i'm pretty sure in a couple of months they'll be expensive as fuck
---
the whole point of the workshops is for them to be taken, held, and defended from real raiders... players.
---
You can get Raider mod plans at the the cabin right next to top of the world. Vender inside sells them.
---
I haven't seen any of the "rarer" masks and the only people who claimed to have seen them can't provide any proof. I'm guessing they're miss labeling some of them by calling the red mask the devil mask and really don't know much about the event. 
---
I'm thinking they'll get released slowly throughout the week so that everyone doesn't just grind for them all in one night.
---
If you on PC i have an anti armour sniper rifle you might be interested in
---
Okay so hear me out, the Enclave are evil, every game confirms this and people who genuinely think they're good concern me. But...
---
C'mon, I know EVERYONE is selected by MODUS as an operative, but they way he says "men and women who can accomplish certain tasks" makes me feel like an elite member of some secret team or something. Plus; apart from Senator Blackwall's murder, there's no way my character could know how evil the Enclave is, he could chalk it up to the human element when necessary.
---
So I have to go with Enclave. I've never been fond of the Brotherhood any whichway...
---
Worked! Thanks &lt;3
---
Right. I've never even seen it. I thought the wave of wolf's and stingwings was the last attacke 😂😂🤦‍♂️
---
We were just halfway through the event when one of our guys drop a nuke on Helvz. 
---
We all instantly died, along with the bots, failing the event. 
---
Gotta admit l, it was super funny. 
---
I really enjoyed reading your post about the enjoyment and excitement you get from this game. Mainly because I'm half your age and just became a dad so I don't get much time to play lately. But I plan on being gamer for as long as possible. Kudos to you! 
---
Go into the crafting menu, hover over molotov and it should give you the option to unflag.
---
I loved the Teddy bear armour. With all these new pointless Teddy bears, it could be cool to see that idea return. 
---
Well, I did eat the one guy, but that wasn't part of my grudge, that was just business. I'm a hungry fella😁 
---
I have an extra, but I'm PC
---
I no way am I saying it’s ok to one-shot legendary creatures, but that’s really not the goal of fasnacht, it’s a community event to celebrate springs return and get the community together and collect new items(the masks and recipes) and have some fun playing together. Also ironically you forgot about people who forget it’s a game and take games too seriously sometimes. Unfortunately not everyone is gonna play fair ( believe me I wish they would too).
---
If on PS4 press R3
---
It's easier if you hover over an item that requires glass to build. 
---
Suiciders were the band of my existence when I first played FO4, so I know their sound from max render distance lol.
---
It's most excellent seeing older players on here rather than the 12 year olds yelling that they fucked my mum. I've just started FO76 myself and having a good time.
---
Where did you see that ? 
---
i believe you missed the marine armor combat helmet, and no im not referring to the tactical one.
---
On PC mate but I will continue your legacy.
---
To be fair though this event isn't really meant for high levels like the SBQ is. it's kinda geared towards the littler fellas, I also can agree that it's pretty annoying to not even get a shot in on the sloth.
---
Literally screenshotting so i can do it
---
I've been there after the nukes have subsided and still seem the nuked flora and piles of meat goop with glowing meat and nuclear waste inside them. It can be done.
---
Can confirm this exact bug happened to us twice today. But, we realized we can keep nuking it anyway cuz we just over stock on intestines before running it in the nukezone to ensure success. 
---
&gt;1. The insecure little shits. That’s you, the ass-shits who one-shot the legendary mega-sloth at the end with your god mode explosive shotgun the second it spawns, because you’re only there for the masks anyway. 
---
Dude the Sloth doesn't drop max level legendaries or stuff over 1☆ I'll hit it with a assaualt rifle and tag it so others can get loot but TBH it's a shitty drop everytime.
---
Also did you realize you tagged every bullet point as 1. I'm not trying to be mean this is just a heads up for an edit.
---
We're gonna have to start the legion of bad knees!
---
for anyone that reads this in the future, it is working today. I did this step of the reply from the Bethesda ticket:
---
Open Xbox Live Ports   
---
 \----------------------
---
To ensure there are no issues  connection to the Fallout 76 and Xbox Live severs, you should open the  following ports on your router:  
---
* TCP: 80 
---
* TCP: 443 
---
* UDP: 3000-3010 
---
For exact directions on port forwarding your router, please refer to your router's manual or website.
---
Then afterwards, I uninstalled the game completely, and reinstalled. It started working once it was done. 
---
You need to apologize to her, friend. No game is worth that.
---
They specifically said they want to encourage trading with other players
---
Have you finished the main quest line?
---
Is this at the very top of the map near the car stone henge?
---
Not sure if you play on console or PC, but this was not my experience on pc.  There may have been 1 or 2 people hanging around( A friend of mine for example logged in his fault to get an extra reward) But there were so many people on that you couldn't even tag a rad toad...  Out of the about a dozen times I got to run it, it only failed once because somebody nuked the server and it killed all the squirrels in the area lol
---
It's a cosmetic event. I think it's pretty nifty. I don't see where it should have ever given the impression it was going to give legendary equipment or anything.
---
Yes, I know. 
---
It’s the only legendary, and it carries screws, and it doesn’t change the disappointment factor each time I miss it. 
---
Yeah everytime I've started the event it's like a 2-5 minute wait for the parade to start after all the set-up is done. Luckily I haven't run oit of time yet.
---
OMG! This is sooooooo what happened.
---
Platform? 
---
Same problem here in Germany
---
Right, my bad. I play on pc
---
Did the event for the first time yesterday.  No idea what’s going on.  One of the boys was hanging way back behind in the parade and most players left him.  I hung back to protect.  Totally missed the sloth.  Regardless, this event like the new nukeshine one are both lame, written for the idiots on consoles.  Really, you have to circle on map where to go find corn?
---
This. 
---
I think that they where never meant to be unbanned
---
I’ve been not using it even though I’m encumbered without it atm(got some stuff I’m saving for a friend) because it move so slow, it’s a lot of fun when everyone is wearing the masks.
---
Theirs a tin foil hat?
---
They just havent got to it yet. Every build has taken a hit. Wait til the pvp servers come out, nerfs will be soon after.
---
It's multiplicative so it reduces damage to 29% without including the reduces damage from DR/ER
---
I'm getting München beer festival flashbacks. 
---
I found you can get intestines from opossum in flatwood after the event ends. So maybe you could stock up on them and be able to bypass that part,even with a nuke. It seems like a useless amount of work tho.
---
You can go into photo mode.
---
Wait, what’s that pizza sign?
---
Yes but the military will immediately change the color to military paint job. Just like in fallout everyone company who gets one will paint it with their colors
---
How? Maybe they castrated you incorrectly. You poor soul.
---
I haven't messed with the settings, and while I know it'd be tedious, isn't it possible to shift to English for the duration of you playing and the switch back?
---
Though it doesn't solve the problem with Bethesda essentially Cutting the entire Italian group, it should hopefully get you back onto the game?
---
I havent been to the bog yet, so I think got mine from a vendor in the forest.
---
Very unhappy when I accidentally scrapped it, and havent found another.
---
Been told the only consistent location is House of Scares.
---
So I suppose is for most non english release
---
I'm 56!
---
This worked ! Thank you, kind samaritan !!
---
Getting killed in a game that has pvp is not being bullied.  Maybe you should stick to single player or co-op games like minecraft and roblox until you grow up.
---
Lol, and you're the traveling chef. Bonus points for double irony. Have you been to Bolton Green by Morgantown yet? It had a very White Glove Society vibe.
---
You on PS4?
---
Believe it or not I have actually tried this, but the majority of the time the camera angle is in a position that makes it so photomode "is unavailable right now. there is no room for your camera"
---
I would love to have a kitty cat at my camp location 
---
Is it over? I only got to do it once and saw no sloth :/
---
I got a boss that does that. Irl.
---
First we have to
---
But before that, we need to
---
And before you do either of those things first, you need to...
---
Seen exactly this also. 
---
US servers are full of English speaking people so no language barrier there. In the EU, we have a ton of players who don't speak a common language, or English at all.
---
Besides, I have roommates who don't like voices in the middle of the evening-night. I talked once to somebody who ended up speaking for hours and hours non-stop, asking questions after questions about the game, commenting one every action, trying to get me into glitching, PvP with random others. After two days, I had enough and blocked them, then turned off voicechat entirely.
---
So why do you want to talk? Events don't need coordination since it is pretty sure the others have also played it and know what happens when. If they aren't your friends and are on different level, why would they want to interact with you beyond the basic emotes?
---
Seems it's not only an italian problem but most of non english version
---
Civil war era suit and soldier mask. I am but a simple parade goer.
---
I found Grahm at the Grafton steel mill and followed him for a bit when we got attacked by an invisible mothman, if he hadn't been there I would have been toast, I couldn't vats the mothman and not even sure I was hitting it with my tesla.
---
Ahh I went to boltons around launch but me and a buddy couldn't figure out what to do 😂
---
And while I am on PS4 Im not a traveling chef there~
---
I like to roll incognito online😎
---
He's not going to tell you so you can take his spot lol. There's an acid node west of Watoga in the Savage Divide that's in a cave though if anyone wants that spot. I never see anyone there. Also, if you deploy your camp halfway up the cliff face you can also use the lead resource node at the top of the cliff directly above it.
---
 But, what if that’s the only way to be awarded the rarest masks? (demon, sun, skull. blue winter, harlequin, merman)
---
I’ve been curious all day if nuking the event can offer an extended loot table or not.
---
At least he keeps talking during trades.
---
Dang, thats pretty ridiculous. I hope for the sake of all none English peoples they get it fixed soon. 
---
That or extend the fasnacht festivities for them.
---
quests and events give max XP
---
Same just made a post about it. So sad 
---
They're saying it looks identical to old man winter, just a recolor
---
We would love to see it but you only gave us one picture from a crouching position from the corner of your camp haha. 
---
Thank you! That's awesome. I couldn't even get one hit on the sloth last night before it was dead. As well as most of the other enemies. 
---
Mothman with a Flatwoods monster as his mule. Carries rare and unique items related to aliens.
---
I always clear out Nuclear Waste, Antiseptic, Asbestos - Never hold more than 100 of either
---
Gold / Silver - 50 a piece
---
Bulk all aluminum and lead  
---
I keep 20 bulked Aluminum and 5 bulked lead   
---
Yeah, but it isn’t. The cheeks are bigger I think
---
Please can you tell me where to start this quest 
---
Lucky hole mine and excavator armor.
---
its not supposed to be afaik, but the issues been in the game for awhile now (notably in nukesprings)  i dont think we ever got an official comment on it though
---
I spent 21 hours straight doing the parade, server hopping &amp; stopping to build new plans. Literally. 
---
Started yesterday @ 10am, it’s now almost 7am &amp; I just logged off.
---
Got every C.A.M.P. Plan (I think), a recipe for Fasnacht Donuts, &amp; Beret, Toothy, Witch, Giant, Soldier, Owl, &amp; Summer from the Atom Shop.
---
That’s it. Lots of doubles, it didn’t matter if 3 people did the parade or if more than a dozen did it.
---
Same drops, multiples of each.
---
It seems Bethesda is holding out in a time released fashion.
---
I wager the missing masks start dropping in the next few days. 
---
I have yet to see anyone with Winter, Skull, Sun, Demon, or Jester...
---
They get easier?
---
My first 4 encounters were very short and did not end well for me.
---
Lewiston, Toxic valley, savage divide, and near westek.  
---
Think those wer all 2-4 hit fights.
---
A few levels later.....In the mining HQ building during the excavator quest, glowing.  
---
No other players around.   I found the meat pile when I respawned, so we must have killed each other.
---
When I respawned, so did the glowing one.  Took him out that time.
---
I’m lazy. Thanks though 
---
I ran through Watoga last night, and was excited when a 3* legendary bot spawned right in front of me. Until it proceeded to spontaneously fall over and die before I could fire a shot.
---
I'd like to think it's because my spacesuit makes me soooo drop dead sexy to robots.
---
Happy to help!
---
If you're on PS4, I can make one for ya for like 20 caps.
---
It was my first time doing the event, hopefully it won’t happen again. I’m trying to stock up on legendary weapons in preparation for the vendor that’s coming. 
---
Pfft I'm wearing nuka cola and nuka quantum power armor mix with a fasnacht hat (red one from atom store to mstch the nuka cola). You mind your own business
---
I wouldn't be part of the ass hats usually but OMG the new event is so damn boring dude. I just want the damn plans and then i'm done with it. i have more fun doing the other events i have done 100 times over then this. their is  no challenge to this event and way to many people doing emote instead of doing the event. yes lets all stand here and do emote while the robots are getting destroyed by exploding mutants  and then be mad at the dude with the explosive weapons that's actually trying to keep them alive. ohhhh but everyone suddenly have weapons when that sloth spawns. get my point?. either way i am the ass hat because I want to do the event and get it over with but on the same side everyone else is just emoting non stop wasting my time.  
---
Hopefully there's a hotfix coming soon. I can deal with the long rendering after the game loads or the reintroduction to unstable, crashing servers but this particular bug is a huge burden when farming. It happens whether in near the even or not.
---
The event is designed so everyone from level 1-whatever can participate together. Like a parade should be. They should fix it by temporarily preventing nukes from being dropped in that area.
---
The moonshine mama mask will be available in the atom store on the 21st. 
---
3 here, cant play without shitting my diaper
---
For starters, I never let any type of junk get above 200. At that point it's enough to craft or repair most things.
---
Then just generally restocking things as I use them.
---
34 here.  Been gaming since 1989.  
---
The sloth is horribly bugged. It froze in place and became unlootable 3 times yesterday. Even after tagging it doesn't always have loot. I assume it has to do with the number of people.
---
The beret is rare?  Well, damn.  I got it during my first parade and then sold to a vendor for a few caps since I never thought I'd use it
---
Also, if you find the rusted key with the alien blaster, you can open the room on the roof. Not much in there from what I’ve seen but I’ve only opened it once.
---
Yup Fallout 76: Short Yellow Bus Edition (Special).
---
Is that the cave with the hole in the roof kinda close to the vault? I used to live there! 
---
But didn't it get a new paintjob? I'm almost certain I saw one in the Atom Shop?
---
For the low price of just 800 atoms, now you can!
---
I’ve had issues since last weeks update.  Can’t seem to stay on for more than 30-40 minutes.  Completed the Fasnacht event then headed to the train station annnnd disconnected.  
---
Exactly. It's a spot of fun with some masks for the folks who want them. If somebody does Fasnacht expecting it to be anything other than a low-level fun time, then that's on them.
---
ok. I get it. But let's say you got one of the ultra rare mask, do you WANT to TRADE it for something else? I'm pretty sure you will keep that mask. The only way you want to trade it if you have a double ultra rare mask and you need to find someone else who has a double ultra rare mask too. No one wants to trade their ultra rare stuffs from a limited time event with caps.
---
Besides the trading system right now won't allow us to trade item for item. You need to set your stuff for 0 caps and the other person do the same thing. It's REALLY risky to do this trade, specially when the stuffs you wanna trade is really rare. If the person bought your stuff faster for 0 caps and then cancel the trade and leave. You'll get nothing.
---
Might wanna check the atoms shop
---
I had 3\* enemies at **Watoga,** **Harper's Ferry** and at the Flooded Trainyard just a couple of hours ago. A 3\* at RobCo yesterday. I'm level 48.
---
My experience is that if Watoga has a 3\* enemy (Protectron), that server will keep respawning 2-3\* in Watoga during the session (wait 30 minutes before going back).
---
Whitesprings seem to be nerfed now and West-Tec rarely spawned any legendary for me in the past 200 hours (current and previous character). The Steakhouse is a hit-and-miss.
---
16
---
Frick nuke zones
---
That's sweet. My base is in a satellite dish. Every time I logged in I've fallen to death. Do you know how it feels when death is awaiting you? 
---
Please add  **fast travel mats**  my life depands on it. wait... and add if you log in in your base near that you spawn at the mats, my life depends oN IT! AHHH \[Respawn?\]
---
The new helmets are cool and all. But I don’t wanna give up the practicality of having protection against airborne disease just to look a little whacky 
---
Witch's Hat!!
---
Odd, doing the event last night somebody chucked a molotov and three robots died at the same time.
---
Could have just been bad timing.
---
That is genuinely creepy/awesome :D
---
Are you going to hang around the Glassed Cavern and just welcome new arrivals? xD
---
I got the confetti my first run through the parade, but got masks the next two times. It's such a low-effort event, it won't be hard at all to grind
---
I bulk and sell anything over 100.  
---
With the exception of:  Screws, Balllistic Fiber, Lead, Steel. 
---
Turn lead and steel into ammo until I run out of one or the other.  Screws and Ballistic Fiber are divided up amongst my friends and used for crafting and repair. 
---
Good list. Just 1 addition I horde Black Titanium for repairing and making Power Armor
---
Tried a lot of things that didn't work but did these 2 things that allowed me to complete it, sorry not sure which might have been the cure.
---
1. Took off all armor.  (Including a piece of chameleon). Hopped naked onto new server.
---
2.  Used a bottle of bourbon I found during Fasnach vs. one I had crafted. 
---
Worked no problem, not sure which method helped, but pretty easy to just do both to clear it.  
---
Man. I'd kill for balloons.
---
I guess I'm gonna be doing a heck of a lot if fasnacht stuff lol
---
55 here and level 103 who identifies with the BOS faction.  I used to have a character who looked like me but that was like every morning looking at myself in the mirror and thinking death is soon.  I now have a smoking hot female as a character who sleeps and plays their guitar in front of two Nuka Girl posters while I wait.  Much more satisfying to play that way.  Ha!
---
P.S.  I hate griefers and if anyone likes to hunt them down as a group and render just revenge, look me up on xbox.  Gamertag:  Erebus Imperium
---
Ad Victorium!
---
I have seen cats and also real dog. (real like meatdog).
---
no, it goes on for a week. I woulnd't worry too much about the Sloth as it is very hard to get a hit in with all the high level people there. I am level 96 and not God level equiped and even my lowest weapon (a cultist dagger I am not speced for) would kill him rather quickly. You get another 5-10 players going in with thier lowest weapon, it still dies damn near instantly. Also if you see no loot, keep looking for its head. That had the loot for me while the body had nothing.
---
I think that is incredibly inconsiderate of the low level players and new players that just started after the new content drop. It's a seasonal holiday event, let it be what it is. Stop trying to make everything for level 200+. Even a nuked Whitesprings aggravates me sometimes. Atleast leave the train station out of it, I still need to do my vendor runs 😂😂😂

---
Fasnacht Moonshine Mama Mask, available March 21st in the atom shop. 
---
Time to finally use my atoms!
---
it depends what you want to do
---
but no matter what you do I would always be on the look out for screws, springs, aluminium, ballistic fiber, adhesive, plastic.
---
as far as other materials it truthly changes on what you want to do but I wouldnt keep more than 100 to 150 off each, wood i usually have around 250 and steel 300.
---
that works for me, I also bulk materials to safe space or to sell. 
---
Mm, yeah. But like the other fella said, it's really low level. If it weren't for the Super Suiciders, there would be _no_ challenge lmao
---
Not a bad idea!
---
Keep steel/lead/acid/cloth for ammo. Better, make ammo because that weights less than the junk you need.
---
Keep ballistic fiber, springs, screws and gears for making and repairing
---
Rest, keep no  more than 100-150 and bulk the rest to sell at vendor.
---
49 here. Been gaming since Pong......
---
Omfg, i still have my Aftermath books stashed and dragg them out for a little inspiration. Most of my friends have moved away, but we're still feeling for that RPG. Operation Morpheus was a blast.  The whole Fallout series has been a decent fix for that. And 76 lets me geek with my younger brother, being 52, with a commodore 64 in the closet, it's making the ride to retirement a little easier. Ah the memories.
---
I often have long stretches of playtime where I'm in no danger. So in situations like that, it's fun to mix up the looks. 
---
Really?! When?
---
Ah I gotcha. My psn handle is the same as here. I made this account just to post about FO76 lmao.
---
It's definitely meant for more than one person, but I almost got it done with one randy the other day. A coordinated group of 4 would be best though. Yiu have to search for table settings and keep enemies out of the dining room at the same time, but now you still "complete" the event even if you don't finish everything. You just get better rewards for doing more of it.
---
PvP is always a very niche player base unless the game is built and focussed around PvP only, But when its mixed into a PVE game you will always see more people playing that prefer PVE this Poll shows this and its not a surprise... Destiny, warframe, Division and other live service games all show this to be the case just surprised that devs/publisher try to mix the two....
---
haha yea i forgot to mention that one - also hoarding over 500 currently haha
---
have done it,  unequiped all cards, all weapons, all armor, stored it stash, equiped everything again.   first time it worked for like 15 minutes, second time for like 20 minutes. which makes this bug even stranger.   both times it stopped working after fast travelling
---
That tiny town seems to be a VERY common Ghram spawn in my experience.
---
I love Ghram.
---
Ever since the patch Harpers Ferry has been overrun with 1-3* legendary ghouls for me.  It’s crazy how many have been appearing.  A bit annoying when I show up just to sell things and get swarmed with ghouls radding me out.  
---
Same assholes that nuke it methinks
---
Yeah. I've only been taking billings homestead to make whiskey in batches of 55. That's still been enough time to be attacked twice and since I'm usually overencumbered while doing that I have to close the game since I die without being able to respawn. I've already switched my character over to a PVP build since it's kinda been forced on my but I wasn't even able to take revenge this time.
---
chances are he threw the Molotov because enemy where all around them so he did the smart thing but the then robot died at the same time from one of the enemy.
---
Ah, makes sense we had the hardest time finding plates and just gave up😄 ill have to give it another go one of these days.
---
Well appearently people are afraid of them and let them just blow up those robots pretty easy. Having good mates in the event is critical after all.
---
Weren't they gonna make it so Pacifist mode completely disables PvP if you activate it?
---
The atom shop ones seem to only be the old man summer one in there now, and then they are adding the Fasnacht Moonshine Mama Mask on the 21st. 
---
There is an atomic shop newsletter, and those are the only 2 listed during this event. 
---
I think maybe they will release the others in the event as the week long event progresses.
---
Yesterday.  A decent looking black paint.   Relatively cheap too. 
---
It's not over yet. I think we have till the 26th of March.
---
So what’s the problem ? We speak english here , not italian . Don’t be the english teacher wherever someone wrong something while is writing, you fly over it, it’s not necessary to correct Who write something wrong xD 😂
---
And its not half bad. A nice metal grey and redish rust coloring.
---
Nice!
---
Same with beds. Usually I can photomode. 
---
My current camp “no room for camera” in my sleeping bag.
---
I’ll remember to kill the sloth with my super sledge next time just for you.  
---
We used poisonous gasses...
---
I have obviously hit a nerve.  The definition of a bully is to seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce harm to another.  In the example provided the player clearly did  NOT want to engage in pvp.  The other player did not care and killed him just the same.  That is bullying and in my opinion repeated bullying should be reported and the player should banned if it does not stop.
---
I'm a melee build and my explosive shotgun does not do shit.   So much so I'm using a basic pipe rifle so I can at least tag everything lol
---
I’m not freaking out. I’m aware that I have time to run it more. I was just saying that the only one I want is the owl. I have crappy luck where it usually ends up that the one item I want in games doesn’t drop for me.  I’ll be disappointed if I don’t get it but my life won’t suck because of it. 
---
ign is ascott38. I'll be on with a group grinding the parade after work.
---
And sorting for perish don't even bother to work
---
Same but I also cut less used junk down to 50.
---
Wow i really ment what i have wrote and you are just acting like dummy ? Not a good way to get interest over here in fallout 76 community my friend
---
Mama mia! 
---
I wish a had a singing protectron for my C.A.M.P... *Hey-ooooo*
---
I had an experience with one of these guys after a queen nuke. He ran around calling everyone cowards, slapping with a moleman and cursing. I have a lot of hours in this game, and that was a first.
---
The problem is that in italy you can’t join the game if you don’t put the english language in the ps4 . Unfortunatly the problem is that not everyone can speak/read or understand english , so many people are unable to play . And that’s not right because i paid to play the game And if i don’t know english i can’t play 😂 . I’m lucky because i can speak english. 
---
If you're on PC you can have mine. I'll be on again in about 9 hours.
---
OP stopped updating the post it seems. 
---
Just my opinion here, but I think games *should* have rare items. There's a certain excitement that comes with finding something that's been on your radar forever.
---
Thanks for sharing I didn't know if the blog
---
You shouldn’t have to. But you can also wait 18 hours for a fucking video game, especially if you’re a parent.
---
I have corrected no one actually.
---
Do make as many mistakes as you want. It's not my problem.
---
I merely pointed out that your level of Italian does not really matter in this particular topic and subreddit. 
---
I mean I just thought since it didn’t get traction here r/Fo76FilthyCasuals would appreciate it better. Didn’t mean to be disrespectful. Sorry man
---
I really enjoying the Fasnacht event it so fun to play with other people and I love the mask we get at the end of the event it was so worth it 
---
Fair enough, might just be a case of my shoddy RNG.
---
I do have a theory though, I wonder if being in a more 'mature' server has any benefits. It seems to me that when I first join a server there is a distinct reduction of high level, quality mob spawns.
---
Or I could just be trying to apply any form of order and methodology to the RNG chaos my brain loathes...
---
Cheat’s have nothing to do with this problem. The problem is that from yesterday in italy you can’t join the game if you don’t put the language of the ps4 in english . 
---
You fail to understand.
---
That’s your opinion, not objective truth. 
---
Adventure mode.
---
I don't do PvP.
---
Where does this event happen at?
---
they are called "options" just because users are free to set them as they prefere according to available choises. I'll never tell you how you shoul set your ps and you shouldn't tell how to set mine...
---
So you're saying 1.5k steel is overkill?
---
This is what you get for switching sides in WWII. 
---
Great list. Now we just need pics lol
---
I didn't think the event would start with a camp built there.
---
I can see why people wouldn't want your camp there. It wouldn't bother me as it helps low levels. I also server hop looking for the parade as I can only play for about an hour a night. It's the only way I can do the parade 3 times a night.
---
It's awesome you had such a good group of players before the idiots showed up. Hopefully more good players stick around next time.
---
This is awesome, thank you!
---
I understand, and I do support the Italian fan community in this regard. You and all the Italian player have all the rights to be pissed, and I am behind you 100%.
---
But not when it comes to the unban and/or ban. 
---
I love this. Every parade I went to yesterday, nobody attacked anyone afterward. There was a guy with a bounty at one of them; nobody touched him. I got curious and shot him once to see if we could even attack a bounty player during an event. Yes, you can. But no one did. They just let him participate with no problems. Nobody was being greedy about his caps. Nothing. It was a nice change. Outside of SBQ fights, you don't really see that comradery short of high level guys finding new players to give free stuff. It was a pleasant surprise and the event is a lot of fun. Monotonous yes, but a great time. I hope they end up doing more events like this in the future.
---
Their names are different from the wiki, so that’s adding to the condition too. 
---
Not if you are building ammo or camp shit haha
---
but yea...probably lol
---
its in the north of the savage divide. look it up on youtube.
---
So they both damage the enemy? And reactive is the better one?
---
No, I've been searching since launch. It doesn't exist yet. Makes me sad.
---
&gt;its in the north of the savage divide. look it up on youtube.
---
Same.
---
getting killed in pvp without owning caps grants you a 2h pvp debuff (-50% damage to other players)
---
I dunno what is the deal with the game. I logged in to a banned account this morning as well. not over any stash limits, no duping, no anything. not even a email yet explaining this. 
---
Yeah I tested it before I built it all the way to make sure I didnt interfere with the event. It's set up right by the blown up trucks and logs where the dead cow is lol. 
---
Yeah I really like it, only downside is I never got a tag on the Legendary Sloth as it just got shredded within seconds by level 200 players
---
Rather than bulking lead just use it for ammo when it gets heavy.
---
Rather than bulking aluminum just sell it to a player when it gets heavy
---
Use the saved plastic for shotgun shells or sell to a player.
---
I totally followed your numbers til the stash went to 800.
---
I have a witch mask
---
I could wait much more for a videogame, I've waited too much for an official bethesda note where they gives knowledge of the problem
---
If it freezes, it should still turn into a meat pile after a few minutes. Then you can loot it.  Also look for sloth body parts around it.  If someone blew off an arm you can loot it immediately. 
---
&gt;Considering that Tignus2099, chief guild of the Munghi Atomici was unjustly banned
---
I'm aware of the Italian language issue. OP started the whining about a banned player and the "free muh boi" garbage.
---
Previous update notes mentioned it. It will also be tied to vending and the fact your camp will be shown on the map. 
---
Watoga. Do the Major for a Day quest (sneak if you have to), then keep shooting the robots one by one.
---
The only way you can get your base damage higher is with a low health build. 
---
Bloodied prefix + Adrenal Reaction + max rifleman/bloody mess/nerd rage at 20% life you can have 600+ base damage on a lever action.
---
what??
---
This happened to me as well, probably same server! I have an executioner’s handmade and just sniped them. They had awful aim so they couldn’t hit me from far away without VATS lol. 
---
Agreed 
---
You can't legally  get it in the game right now, so it is not on the list.
---
Lol, this guy 
---
Some items are on a timer, so that you can't server hop and collect them continuously.  It doesn't apply to all items, but I've noticed this behavior, and I can tell you with relative certainty that this is intended.
---
My take on this (read with a grain of salt, I haven't explored the issue too much), Most (if not all) static items are on a timer, so that you can loot them occasionally, but not every load.  I was under the impression that it was ~1 day reload, but I'm not completely certain about that as I think I've gotten some things sooner.  But for the most part, if I loot a specific item, it won't be around again until the next day.
---
Items in containers, that have random contents, are just that, random.  No noticeable cool down other than play session (server hopping will reset the contents).  These are your typical trash cans, cash registers, etc.
---
And yes, with the servers seemingly slowed down right now ('seemingly' because I'm feeling kind), sometimes the game loads the assets when you log in, but eventually the game realizes that they're on a timer for you, and remove them (before you can actually loot them).  It's annoying, but understandable once you understand what is going on.
---
Besides the current one in the Atom Shop, there's also an all Black paint job that was datamined for the Atom Shop as well.
---
Yup
---
One time a legendary sloth showed up but it still was no match for the wave of bullets from power armoured players. I was unable to get a hit on it cuz it died in 10 seconds.
---
Made out tonight pretty decent.
---
5 Soldier
---
3 Owl 
---
3 Witch 
---
2 Giant
---
2 Toothy
---
2 Beret
---
Lantern Poles
---
Snowflakes
---
Bonfire Effigy
---
Garland
---
Confetti 
---
Helv Banner
---
Hopes of a start on finding the other masks tomorrow
---
You're Italian, aren't you?
---
Dope
---
Coupled with the trackable goals for atom store credits this is awesome. Being able to plan and budget what I want to buy rather than just hoping for the best.
---
Rng I'm afraid. You and then again you might get the same mask again. 
---
Nice, I love it when players go the extra mile to help others. It's a shame trolls and toxic players are part of every online game. You have the right attitude screw it don't let them ruin your fun.
---
You missed the break they take.
---
And yet sometimes nope.
---
39 and spent way too much of my life on GTA. Felt the world was coming to and end soon playing that game with all the younglings scorched earth play-style.  FO fan since 3 and love all of em with FO76 renewing my faith in humanity.  I do wish there was more in game options to group up and not have to interact with Discord or other avenues.  Video games are my escape from daily drama and FO76 is a perfect fit.  
---
Eh.  
---
Alternate POV:
---
I generally carry too much stuff to fast travel, so when I get the on screen an event is starting, I have to hot foot it to the event area.   
---
For the parades I did last night, I was in the sutton train station - not that far away, but still several minutes and a couple pauses to rebuild AP along the way. 
---
So ya, by the time I got there, the prep work was done and the parade had already started.   Lvl 200s in the front blowing up anything that moved, somone setting off mini-nuking, another going full throttle with a minigun, energy weapons...
---
So I walked along/esorted the slowest robot as rear guard.  Melee fighter, so pretty much silent, and being at the rear, likely noone witnessed me getting a kill or two, so why grudge the reward?
---
Well yeah you don't always get a mask, OP just asked if you could get more than one :-D
---
Does it specify excavator on it?
---
Thanks for the offer but I’m on Xbox. Hopefully I’ll get it when I run it today. 
---
Put it on and stand on top of the Fasnacht Bonfire which has the Old Man Winter and compare.
---
Does everyone get their own copy of the loot if that happens?
---
I just got yelled at yesterday for using a "damn Two Shot Explosive weapon", it was actually just a bloodied combat shotgun with the Bloody Mess perk causing the sloth to explode.
---
Yes, it is somewhat annoying. Also just holding your breath does it too, which makes little to no sense.
---
Very true. I plan on going back today for more lol. Bad or good no one stops datcats fun. 
---
exo-skeleton is not the same as exo-suit, Power Armor are exo-suits, what Matt Damon wore in Elysium is an exo-skeleton.
---
I'm still seeing legendaries in Whitespring, I'm not sure they're as common as they were before, but they're certainly still around enough to visit.
---
I build at workshops all the time and have literally never had this happen. I build defensive structures and stay inside of them if I'm at the workshop. This will give me plenty of time to know if someone is trying to kill me because they'd have to destroy the structure to get to me. This wouldn't prevent someone from using the fast travel tactic you described, but there's a long delay from the time you're notified your workshop is being attacked and when they can load in on you. In fact, you could probably pop some berry mentats and see them spawn in and kill them before they could even move. There are plenty of ways to prevent being "farmed" if you accept the game for what it is and stop trying to whine it into being something else.
---
yes, born 30 years after the war ended. I hope you are joking
---
The full story is that you entered a CAMP uninvited (due to a glitch that removes locks).
---
You pushed a low level character away from the bag to take the contents, and the drop bag method was only being used due to Bethesda changes that would not allow overweight characters to trade.
---
You took much more than a few garbage plans, and you know it.
---
You quickly logged out and blocked the accounts, because you knew there would be repercussions for stealing that much stuff.
---
It's just a game, and the items you took are not that important, but in the end don't be surprised or salty if you have a few bad days in the wasteland.
---
Given how I play FO76 I take this as a complement. Thank You
---
How do you play FO76? Oh wait nevermind I forgot you can't
---
Agree.  Hell even the guys who kill you are usually ok to talk to after they smack you down :)
---
Cool. I'm at work now but I'll be on tonite around 7pm eastern. We can meet then if that's good with you
---
Dude, if you think I'm serious, you might need to hop off the Internet. 
---
Io ho disinstallato il gioco e ora lo sto reinstallando. Magari funziona
---
Yes, there are, but almost always 1\* and the rare 2-3\* always drop 1\* for me for some reason.
---
Got about 15 so far varying in 5 types. Keep it up and you’ll get your collection completed hopefully by the end of the week.
---
Yeah had one group of TSE Bloodied Deathclaw follow my group the the festival and just whereever we teleported slapping us trying to farm caps out of us. As a mid level 30 character even the slap damage is severe guys claw did 1600 a hit with 40% extra speed.... 
---
That's two different songs, that happens to share a bit of melody (maybe not by a coincidence even) and a name. First one is about river that actually is in WV, and other one is about a indian chef daughter named  Shenandoah.
---
What I always considered might be a good idea is to blueprint your workshop setup. This would require the precision of figuring out exactly where to stand in the exact same place when you make the blueprint, pop in, get the workshop and then stand in that exact same place when you slap the blueprint back down. It is probably tedious. Haven't tried it myself. But until they actually implement a feature that allows you to have a preset workshop layout, this might be the best option. If you try it, let me know if it works!
---
For the record, he never told you what you should do, he literally just said he has his set to english and hasn't noticed.
---
Same same
---
Airborne disease is really only an issue in the Ash Heap and when you're near the sentient cranberries or whatever they are in the Cranberry Bog.
---
Still the legendary might be lost. But it's low lvl who cares anyway.
---
ci han già provato in tanti senza successo.....
---
I’m on a mother$!&amp;?%^?! boat!
---
Nope, I've gotten the legendary every time, even in a meat pile. 
---
I dont care who appriciate this better . this topic is a part of fallout 76 music in game so i post it here where it belongs not where i will get most karma ... 
---
just to be sure. There's a lot of strange people on Internet ;)
---
The respawn rate and occupied placeholders I get but every since the event I can walk into a room filled with desk fans and typewriters and as I attempt to loot them they won't register then suddenly they all start disappearing one by one. This is not a normal occurrence. I've only begun seeing this bug as soon as the even started. 
---
Cool cool, I’ll be on around 5ish 6 eastern U.S. time
---
I mean, probably you are a little bit but you'll grow out of it. Everyone is at least a little bit trash when they're young. Just make sure you pupate out of the trash stage and everything will be fine.
---
it already does
---
i love it and think it's good fun. my only qualm is that it is a low-level event. low level hoards, low level drops, its literally in the forest lol. i just wish they had a better method of scaling. or even if the parade toured all of Appalachia, with the event popping up in different cities across the map, scaling based on location.
---
regardless, i did maybe 10 of these or so last night and i can say i will be milking this all i can for the next week.
---
Exacly but the tune is the same making my confussion and reminding myself about this song
---
I think it's incredibly stupid that I have to pay because some jack wagon killed me.
---
Only tried the event once yesterday, no mask. 
---
You're not missing much; 1* level 35 loot. I've gotten loot every time on my level 25 alt. I'm guessing glitch.
---
they come in handy for the SBQ
---
server hopped right into a nuked Helvetia.
---
luckily i was able to hop out with 25% health left.
---
I can’t say it enough. Get some help dude. 
---
I was building ammo but I've slowly started to move over to melee.
---
In that case I apologize but if that was the sense the answer is rather OT
---
Huh. That's weird.
---
I've had weight issues when first logging in, it is (at least in my case) related to the lag that has happened with the start of the new event (I'm assuming due to all the people coming back, and a lot of server hopping going on).
---
I'll load in, wait 2-3 minutes for the server to let me know if the event is happening, then *walk* towards the event since I'm showing over weight.  I few minutes later or so, the game eventually recognizes my perk cards, adjusts my total weight, then things are more or less back to normal.
---
Try giving it a few extra minutes, and see if you eventually shed the pounds.
---
There is a fissure near there.  Constant SB spawn that wrecks your camp.  I couldn't make it work :-(
---
Less than a day.
---
Take a nap.
---
Pay attention to your kid.
---
Look at some memes
---
You will be fine.
---
I've not had any problem taking photos while playing an instrument.
---
They’re talking about using it for cargo handling, not combat. Probably stays yellow
---
Aw man! I guess it would make sense, a Bloodied Explosive faster reload one would be oh so broken!
---
I wish Bethesda would fix that center roof trim piece my C.A.M.P has the same missing piece. Nice thought out C.A.M.P  I think you need a baby Deathclaw as a therapy creature.
---
Congratulations 
---
I think mix it up is the worst one... rock bottom isn't as bad as it seems.  Killing 76 enemies while intoxicated is easy, take a photo while diseased, drunk, and naked is easy, and killing chickens and squirrels while drunk and wearing a beer hat is easy while doing the parade as squirrels are all over the place.  That ones way easier than drinking 20 mixed drinks and doing 40 quests and events
---
And we poisoned their asses
---
I am sorry this is happening to you though, sucks to miss out on a whole day of a seven day event, especially with no communication.  Hope they figure it out soon!
---
I've done the event 3 times now &amp; never even seen the Sloth, but I just stick close to the robots &amp; handle anything that gets by everyone else, I don't have any need to kill low level enemies and deprive the low level players of the XP &amp; resources they need.
---
That’s what I said. All I got was the flag pole plan. Didn’t even see the sloth, not even the body. I was a little confused at the whole thing at first, and everyone ran around doing all the tasks like they’ve been doing it for years, so I didn’t contribute much. I read that that could affect your rewards, but no mask? Dumb. Didn’t have time to try the event again yesterday, I’ll try again today. 
---
When the dupers " fun" ruined the in game economy and led to TSE's being nerfed I can see why they don't want you to have fun.
---
Can anyone confirm if they've seen more than 4 masks and the berret? That's all i've been able to find and I haven't seen any other masks on players.
---
I think personally, a mix is necessary for the game.
---
I will play in survival, despite being entirely a PvE oriented player.
---
I'll fight for my life if I have to.
---
It's just something that adds excitement, danger, surprise... Fear. Something this game genuinely lacks and this game really turns into a hurrdurr run around I'm invincible.
---
Survival, or content with pvp =/= pvp focused.
---
The option is there, but the game will never be. It's just an extra layer that makes the game much more emotional. 
---
I'd happily share the secret of its reliable location but you must first allow me to do that, I respect your right to search for stuff yourself
---
Part of the Greek letters plan. It was just added with the Nukashine dlc
---
So many people down voting and responding so sensitively 🤔 no ones taking your robot suits away don't worry 
---
I got most of the suicide mutants from a rooftop. At least half the toads. I did get the loot on the sloth, too. 
---
I also got a Toothy Man Mask and Father Winter Bonfire plans (not sure if that was the name) from an event in which I literally turned in 10 eggs and sat on the church roof til the sloth fight. 
---
Doesn’t seem that contribution changes much. Never had a protectron die, though. 
---
What are reactive plates 
---
Those are static items, so yeah they aren't there if you've looted them recently.  The game just takes longer to know that now.
---
It's probably related to the event, lots of people logging in again, lots of server hopping (I'm guilty of that bit).  I think the servers are too wimpy to handle the extra traffic right now, so they're struggling to keep up.
---
If the game is really keeping track of all the static items you've looted in the last 24 hours or so, I can see how that's a lot of data to have to download when you log in.  I can't verify my thoughts here, but if I'm correct it all makes a little more sense how things are going right now.
---
This is amazing! Thanks for creating this list! I am an outfit collector and am super happy to see from this list that I am shy of only a few outfits to owning all the diff outfits in game so far! I rarely have enough caps to buy them off the trades in reddit or discord and have attained most by sheer luck from drops, finds or the warmest kind of generosity from luckier friends 😊 seems I still have a few more to go but all is good! It is by far what really keeps me playing! 👍 best of luck to other fellow outfit collectors as well 🍀✌️
---
any time people are upset about something like killing enemies too quickly, they immediately scream "FUCKING TSE!!!!!!" i use my TSE handmade for all of the parades I've been in, and im able to shoot one or two shots without doing serious damage. i shoot everything a couple times to get credit and let others do the same. other times, people just truck in with anything (it really doesn't have to be that OP of a weapon, the event is in the forest for christ's sake) and plow through the event without a care. it isn't about what weapons you use, its just how you do it.
---
PS4 was good up until the last 2 weeks, now it crashes and disconnects regularly again.
---
1 step forward, 2 steps back! 
---
I don't think so, currently documenting my drops i received:  
---
Soldier mask + Bonfire plan  
---
Toothy man mask + Ribbons decoration plan  
---
Owl mask + Sausage Recipe  
---
Owl mask + (Street?) Lantarn plan
---
But even military cargo vehicles and other things have the military paint s on it 
---
God's work 
---
If you run it a few times you end up knowing where everything spawns. I’ve been watching those places at the end so I can get one VAT hit with my sad little sniper rifle before the higher levels obliterate the sloth. 
---
I know and yet....I have a pile of giant masks to sell now.
---
You can bet on it. Before the TSE nerf my  blackpowder pistol was 1600 damage, and now it's 400. I need a bloodied Explosive now. And Blunderbuss of the same. I hope they add it!
---
I can't believe how much work it took to DM a real RPG session. My head used to hurt. It's nice to have a fast CPU to do all that these days but I can't help feeling a little stupider for it.
---
I'll swap my beret for an owl mask if you still need it.
---
My PSN is tracyg1976 and I'll be on maybe 5pm UK time
---
I think the parades are the the most people I’ve ever seen in one location, and there was great interaction between people, as you said, here’s hoping future events will continue to encourage people enjoying the game together.
---
Helvetia. in the forest, along the river that runs south of Morgantown
---
ah ok thanks, its all kinda confusing really, i appreciate the info!
---
As far as one handed melee goes the Death Tambo is worse. It’s just way more rare. 
---
Pretty boring, the new content so far is fairly trite. Learning to make alcohol and grinding an event for masks isn't really what I was hoping for! 
---
I've noticed that a lot while indoors, yesterday while waiting for the parade I started playing a banjo inside one of the houses and wasn't able to take pictures for this same reason.
---
But it worked with the instruments outside near the bridge.
---
Might be a way that Bethesda tried to evade clipping the camera with walls and ceilings
---
I found Grahm in Helvetia last night between Fasnacht runs after my friends and I were keeping our eyes peeled for him for nearly a week. I initiated trade and IMMEDIATELY got hit with a server crash. It was upsetting.
---
same here. Whats your username?
---
Awesome thank you! As people add to the list I'll edit this post adding the list.
---
Totally! I'm just hoping they don't focus their priorities strictly towards PVP once this is over and survival comes out. Love hanging out with all you guys in the wastes. Yesterday was a blast. Pictures and trading and parading. Love it!
---
I made a brief list of the reasons that led our community to protest and among these reasons there is also a wrong ban. I will explain to you, that you are a civilized and polite person, very willingly the problem of ban. This is an ethical choice. I have never, ever, exploited a bug or game glitches, despite being aware of all those that I could have dishonestly exploited. Game from the first day of B.E.T.A. and I know of glitches that increase the level by cracking locks to infinity. I know of the "very large" armor weight bug to increase the transportable weight. I know of the various systems that appeared on the network to duplicate game objects. But I have never used or abused any of these "methods". I've always played honestly and my account details can prove it. My only mistake was that I found an abandoned bag with thousands of ammo and junk and I immediately picked them up. I thought I was very lucky and instead it was a disgrace. You who would have done it for me? If in reality you found a bag full of money what would you do? This is an ethical rather than a legal dilemma. Moreover from the e-mail I received from Bethesda I am accused of having used a duplication system, nothing more wrong. What upsets me most of all though is the unfounded negative reaction I read in this post. Instead of having support in this difficult situation I get vegetables on my face. Thank you
---
Woah. Great story. I'll look out for you! My Tag is my Username and I hope you'll find some people that will share the same thought. :3
---
I hopped servers as well, worked out great at first, but after a while it seemed like the crowd died down (or I got unlucky) and active parades got a bit less common after a while.  I still managed to get in 7-8 attempts in a few hours.
---
Less than a day for an official comunication concernig a mess they made is too much. You probably don't know how to work professionally.
---
Take out my child from the discussion, I don't want your advices and mostly I don't need them.
---
Just asking, can you fast travel to the event, or do you have to manually haul it over to Helvetia?
---
Even twenty level 1s would take on 5 to 8 level 5 enemies no problem. I think the real problem is the sever being able to throw a decent amount of enemies at a group of people.
---
AFAIK it doesn't. The reward only depends on how many robots survived.
---
So far I’ve received:
---
Owl Mask x2
---
Soldier Mask x2
---
Toothy Mask x2
---
Beret
---
Balloons
---
Streamers
---
Ribbons pole
---
Doughnut recipe
---
Hanging snowflakes
---
yes it does looks good. 
---
You can fast travel to the Event. 
---
Almost the same as my Reddit one, Grammcowz I think? It’s the second of 2 accounts, I wanted to start fresh when getting back into the game
---
Did a parade in a nuke zone last night. Pretty awesome. There was a guy shooting flares off as we marched around. Looked really great. I'm bring a flare gun to the next one.
---
That's cool, hope to visit someday if you're on pc
---
My rule of thumb is keep:
---
* Ballistic Fiber
---
* Screws
---
* Plastics
---
* Crystal (I need it for Cryolator ammo).
---
Never keep more than 5 Bulks of anything else.  Sell the excess or do something with it.  Depending on the bulked good, that might range from 30 to 150 units of it.
---
Keep a close eye on these and sell them as you see fit, because their weight really adds up:
---
* Raw Asbestos
---
* Waste Antiseptic
---
* Silver Scrap
---
* Gold Scrap
---
* Gunpowder (if you're melee, you don't care as much about this, and it weighs a lot).
---
* Ultracite Scrap (for the time being, only so much you can do with it).
---
Yeah, im doing it for the recipies, I only have donuts right now
---
I feel sorry for anyone relying on you.
---
I’ve seen a couple of people in yellow berets, hadn’t seen them before. Any ideas where they’re from or how I get one ? Thanks 
---
Some cunts just want to break shit and drag you as far into their misery as possible. Sorry to hear anyone is dealing with this kind of toxic garbage.
---
Right now some soul from Bethesda marketing is looking at this thread in sheer amazement at the amount of players over the age of 50. 
---
I just want to say thanks to the over 50 crowd. You vanguards of video games. With your continuing interest and monetary support you have grown this hobby into something incredible. Thank you. 
---
How do i get into the bunker?
---
... a opinion in general is subjective thus no opinion or anything in this world can be objective. do you have a counter argument to my opinion or are you just trying to say words to sound smart to push your subjective opinion. which judging by the down votes you are getting on this thread not many are falling for or think is truth in the first place.
---
Witch mask
---
Giant mask
---
Faschnact Donut

Don't say it...

#[BANG BANG BANG PULL MY DEVIL DIGGER!](https://youtu.be/phxNyjmQDlQ?t=7s)
---
Wow...
---
I hear you can tame this, anyone know if that is true?
---
Same, it is unlootable often
---
Soup ?
---
i havent even been BORN yet!
---
Sometimes if you go into 3rd person and spin your camera around so it's not pressed agaisnt a wall you can enter photo mode. If not successful at first keep trying different angles. 
---
But yes it would be nice to allow the camera to clip through structures. Sometimes you just need a few more inches (that's what she said) and you'd have the perfect screenshot. 
---
It’s not too late to start, Grandpa
---
This is an \_incredible\_ idea.
---
I did a parade in a nuke zone last night. Worked just fine. Got level 40 glowing rad toads and max level super mutants. Maybe just bad luck or a glitchy server, give it another try. 
---
Are you in North America? I'd like to buy a copy for my friend but I can't find it that cheap anywhere.
---
Yeah I was holding back until they let a suicider through. A two bot parade with almost no health starts to feel like a bit of a challenge. 
---
It would be a pleasure to play with you! I am in the same case, I got back in the game recently and none of my friends can find the strength to come back ! Fallout76 is meant to be played in multiplayer :)
---
My IG tag : FunkyFlamby. Ready everyday after work time from 20h UTC+1.
---
The yellow berets are from said event still want one myself
---
Had the same problem. The robots there kept dropping to the ground. First I thought someone sniped it, but don’t think that was the case. 
---
Just let 4 of the bots die early on if you want a real challenge. 
---
I love the looks everyone has, no one person was the same and that was super fun to see
---
I don’t have an IG but I do have a discord?
---
This is very true for kids with Bloodied weapons. They really need to take a chill pill or something. 
---
I use Bloodied Weapons (Deathclaw Gauntlet and Black Powder Pistol) but I always keep my health up high so both don't oneshot enemies and give other players a chance to get their shots in. They definitely aren't rare or special, but give them to some young kid who thinks they are the best weapon in the world and you got yourself a kid who thinks they are on top of the world. 
---
what else does it drop if some dink doesn't one shot it?
---
I bet the atom shop made a ton of money just by releasing the excavator power armor skin. 
---
Per the January 29th patch notes, the legendary explosive mod was removed from cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons.
---
&gt; Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments
---
The use of the word temporary in there makes me think there will be some sort of equivalent, but I'm guessing it won't necessarily be explosive 
---
I hear if you scrap it you learn the plan. Anyone confirm? 
---
Death skull mask (haven’t seen it dropped yet)
---
Can’t wait. I was doing the seasonal event yesterday and after I go to return to my base and see “defend your base” and a chode with a 45 cap bounty. Return to my base and find my power room door picked open and both my fusion reactors destroyed and my decontamination room picked open. Ended up chasing the guy halfway across the map to his base and lobbing 15 nuke grenades into his base. I got a 450 cap bounty for it but...worth it.
---
Yeah! The Blunderbuss is the one gun that I myself have never found myself(My friend found one and gave it to me because I have a Pistol/Unarmed build), but I really like it both DMG and the feel of the lucky shots you actually manage to hit. Having more variety to it, like legendary effects, could make some interesting fights.
---
And honestly I have to get a Bloodied Explosive The Dragon, My friend has one and It's really good and I've been in dire need for a good bloodied ranged weapon that isn't a Pistol. Gut punching things get old after awhile and difficult to kill things like Scorched Beasts.
---
That’s aberrant behavior players engage in, which is very difficult to design around. You can be perfectly effective even without legendary weapons of any kind, but when people insist “I’m not having fun until there are no mobs I can’t one-shot”, those behaviors emerge naturally. 
---
At some point designers just have to choose between complaints about the RNG and complaints about there being nothing to aim for. I saw all this already in the Destiny subreddit, when sentiment swung from “yay, no more random rolls” to “we want random rolls back” in a matter of weeks. 
---
Awesome, guess that’s my plan for the evening then lol. Many thanks
---
I did like 6 parades last night. Almost every one turned into a PVP free for all after the event. Looks like its a good spot to kill noobs who don't have pacifist mode on. 
---
Luckily I have enough materials to get me by for now or at least till the event is over. I just hope Bethesda looks into this issue before new permanent DLC content are rolled out. If this small event is causing such a server issue post duper ban imagine when the vaults open up.
---
reported
---
I've seen that "people taking loot out of my list" thing before and I've also never understood if it is intentional or not.  It's always the piddly stuff though, not weapons or armor.
---
The Sloth really needs a significant HP buff, imo.  Not Scorchbeast Queen buff, but maybe Mirelurk Queen.  You get 10+ players doing this event, that thing is dead in just a second or two, meaning that if you weren't on top of it when it spawned (and where it spawns is randomized between a couple spaces, it seems), you don't get anything.
---
I do understand that but as someone who has anxiety issue's in real life PvP is something that actually makes thats worse which is why I personally avoid it, PVE is something you can generally control which helps me calm down and is why I enjoy it PvP being uncontrollable just pushing all the wrong buttons for me.
---
That’s awesome! 
---
Nicely done! 🤙🏼
---
You mean udderly chafed?
---
This is one of my favorite events so far, and I genuinely hope more events like this comes soon. It's a great way to bring people together!!
---
I've been giving extra masks and plans I get from the Event away to someone in the group that I think deserves it since I'm that kind of person who only needs one of one thing and not multiples to hoard. Made quite a few players days doing this.
---
How much of your life is going SO well that this is the thing that tips you? “Fallout 76 destroys mans life because he can’t play it”
---
When was the last time something moved you this passionately?
---
Honestly?
---
Had a full server and all but three people showed up for it yesterday.  Three or four us were on mics, chatting it up, having a good time, and like you said, no bugs.  One guy had the quantum skin, and I got a donut recipe.  Those donuts are the most expensive food I've seen so far, but it's my personal quest to make a dozen of them now.  I'm genuinely looking forward to playing the game when I get off today.  
---
please reply to this so i can block you
---
I can screenshot my phone as proof I did not downvote.  (That's abuse of downvote system in my opinion.  Just downvoting things you do t agree with). Anyway, wearing matching power armor is just as bland as everyone wearing the clown suit in my opinion.  I look better than anyone I've seen in my opinion lol
---
Same stuff a normal sloth drops.
---
They are griefers not pvpers. They don’t want a fair fight.
---
Your a senior player but not a senior citizen
---
Why would they make the masks exactly the same save for the cheeks are bigger? More likely the coloring gives the appearance of bigger.
---
Also there’s actually a sun mask the bee keeper wears. Which would be old man summer 
---
They do drop in about every 300-400 legendaries killed (requires 2-3\*, which seems to happen 12% of the time).
---
I think you believe you hide your anti social streak  really well under that pile of words.
---
This is how I define griefing as well. Been playing since day 1 and never been followed to the next server.
---
Yup, I'm 1 of 3 for the sloth. Gotta be quick, or you get screwed out of it. Need to make him quite a bit more hearty to allow everyone to tag him. 
---
I do too.  They did a good job with this.  It's a real thing in the real town of Helvetia, so that's cool.  It fits in wonderfully with the wacky side of the game, so that's cool.  It changes up a little each time so grinding it doesn't feel as grindy as it could, so that's cool.  It's a nice little co-op event with other players decked out in crazy outfits, so that's cool.  You get funky rewards for a limited time only, so that's cool.  There's not really anything I don't like about this event.
---
The people nuking it are dicks and should die, but whatareyougonnado.
---
Bethesda has probably realized by now, that everyone has found the workaround for the overweight problem, and resumed retrieving inventory from their overweight characters.
---
I suspect many that were banned still had significant inventories on their characters, as many have said they were left with only 10 of each item after the purge, 10 of each when it's Top Tier Weapons &amp; Armor is still a lot of Dupes to flood the market with. Since players are not destroying these items as Bethesda intended, maybe they are reinstating the bans on those that still have excess dupes.
---
On Xbox, I get the 4:8:2000 error sometimes, and assume it's just a generic code for connection errors, since I have always been able to re-launch with success.
---
happy cake day!
---
Thassa spicey-a meat-a-ball!
---
oh, so anyone high level it'd be a useless legendary mostly anyways?
---
Computers aren’t perfect and things like this can happen.
---
So is the skull mask not obtainable?
---
If it's frozen and unlootable, you can also use Bloody Mess and then loot the pieces!
---
Survival just doesn't sound fun. Snipers can use VATS to find you and kill you, and too many griefers as always. How can I complete a guest when chances are some scumbag will love waiting for me in a corner, just to 1 shot me.
---
kill kill kill.
---
You don’t want to fuck with Chally.  If you do, get ready to eat some lead as Graham is very protective of his moo moo. 
---
When I was first playing the game I was in an enclave event and got swarmed by super mutants.  In comes that mofo blasting and he saved my ass.  Props to the G meister 
---
I suspect by tomorrow things will settle down, maybe picking back up again a little on the weekend.  I'm planning on a big push to get drops tonight, and then back to normal play after that, and I bet a lot of people will be doing about the same.
---
Unknown. That's just a mix of what I've been told and seen. I hope so because I too want it
---
Correct unless you had a lower level alt to give it to
---
Living large in the wasteland 
---
Why do you care?
---
Took me a good 5 minutes and three "declined" team requests last night to finally accept the invitation from the guys I was fighting next to. 49 here but with limited mobility in my left hand following a stroke; hitting ctrl+tab in a nuke zone while hacking at ghouls isn't easy. In my button mashing, ended up exiting my power armor twice. I can attest we're definitely not unfriendly; we just can't get to the emotes quickly.
---
I didn't know what to expect, so I actually took my Whitesprings farming loadout as I just came from there and it was definitely overkill.
---
I didn't really consider sharing kills, I never really thought it was a big deal. At Whitesprings people can get competitive about killing the ghouls first.
---
I do believe that if you have worded your title, and your post in a more level headed manner, people would have been more accepting of the situation, if not more supportive, especially if you had followed your post with this particular comment, people would have understood better, and would be able to properly judge and input ideas and opinions.  The gravity of the problem remains the same, but because of your wording, the way you wrote it, the gravity of the problem, faded, people did not took it seriously. 
---
In the online community, radical solutions or demands is more harmful than total silence, at least from what I have seen. This is my opinion, and also my constructive criticism on the matter. 
---
Now, from the developers perspective, this is an easy choice. The PR nightmare, surrounding this game, means the developers try to fix each and every problem as quickly, clearly, and as easily as possible, which means banning innocent people. 
---
I do not say you are innocent, or guilty. I am no judge, and I am in no possition to speculate, and my opinion does not matter anyway. 
---
What I tell you though, is to be patient and try to solve this problem through official channels, without hurting, or involving other players. 
---
Your problem (your ban) is a personal problem, as such, you should present it, attempt to solve it in a personal matter. 
---
Keep the bigger issue(the language bug) away from the smaller issue (the personal ban) in a separate post. Do not try to raise awareness to your smaller issue (personal ban) through the issue of the community, it paints you as a bad guy. 
---
I wish good luck to you. And I hope justice will prevail, regardless of the outcome. 
---
Definitely.  My TSE Dragon is pretty good but Two shot isn't worth it anymore. Bloodied is the best. If you want to get more hits get a high level of perception by using unyielding armor, I got 95% hit chance very far away.
---
As eyed-raisin stated and it has been confirmed by a Bethesda employee on this sub
---
The camp plans can all be previewed in the camp build menu under misc structures, wall decor and floor decor, in addition to the masks there’s also a Beret too
---
Had a guy with this build trolling my fiancée at her camp. Wrecking stuff trying to get her to fight. 
---
Teamed up, fast travelled to her camp, chameleon stealth on the roof. Gauss rifle to his head caused a flinch (breaks sentinel), fiancée proceeded to sit them down with her super sledge. 
---
I’ve learned a lot playing my stealth character. Namely, any sentinel build is weak af to head stagger/cripple. It causes your character to sway/sidestep, cancelling Sentinel. Generally have a preloaded Limb Damage Dragon on my wheel to solve this particular problem. 
---
It was fun. Nobody tried to screw the other players over, everybody was going for a common goal. It was great.
---
Megasloths hate parades....
---
Yeah, I swear, I don't get half the objective updates during this quest.  This leads to me doing things like playing instruments, because I assume that my talking to the conductor registered, only to realize it didn't.  Same with the bonfire, actually.
---
They get stronger but no better loot. The sloth stays the same level and legendary status as well
---
Nice!! Just maxed out my camp budget too, fingers crossed we get a tiny bit more one day, there’s still plenty of love to do. 
---
It justs gives you the suit. Check for an extra PA frame in your inventory. 
---
My experience is that none of the critters spawned in a nuked parade.  
---
Go back to the bunker, interact with all of the computers, click through each entry. You'll get the plans.
---
I do quickly VATS kill the suicider's as soon as I hear them, I don't want them getting near the robots, or me for that matter.
---
By IG i meant In Game but in discord it's the same
---
😂 yup
---
Just like the other person said it comes the event. It seems to be rare though
---
Yeah, I could see that. I'm a filthy meta gamer though and currently using a bloody meathook so I'd probably make better use of the queen's time on the ground whacking the shit out of her.
---
I’m dumb, my bad
---
At least they don't swear back! 
---
😋
---
Most of the people PvPing have no interest in going to a server with other people who actually want to pvp. They want to PK people in unfair fights and if it borders on griefing, they hide behind wanting to PvP. 
---
There’s a room on the second level before the vendor, there’s generally a stealth boy in there.
---
I was a bit confused as well. You have to actually download the plans to your pipboy. Go back into the crafting area in the General's quarters and head over to the terminal in the corner, go through the entries and there should be an option to download Prototype Power Armor. Hope that helps!
---
This I like! Think I did the parade 6 or 7 times today and a few last night too. Only problem is the sloth corpse glitching every time but not too fussed as everyone was having a blast together!
---
It's also my favourite.   
---
I was wearing Police glasses and a military barret before.. But this is awesome.  
---
500 atoms is pretty expensive for a single helmet...
---
In the bunker where the vendor in the cage is (forget the name of that section) there's a terminal to the right of the vendor, should be able to get the schematics off that
---
From what I saw last night, he drops a 1-star level 25 item every time.  If you're past that point in the game, he's only good for a few junk drops.
---
If I can put a shot into him when he spawns, fine, I'll get a small lego to drop for newbies, and half a dozen screws.  If not, no great loss.
---
I have enjoyed this way too much.
---
😂😂😂
---
you can get both of those things from the rare Charleston vendor bot, i believe.
---
Damnit, another 4 months until I can join. Maybe I can rely on just [looking old enough](https://preview.redd.it/mfja17x8k1j21.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98dca727b70d465c287e81e97d7a238f20cf607f) like I did back when I was 17. You fellas don't card, do you?
---
No I am not.
---
But you can buy it from other regions.
---
Europe is where I bought it from.
---
Yeah now that you mention it i ran in to one of these the other night. Here i am building away at my camp re-arranging things and adding a room and this guy is jumping around smacking me with his deathclaw gauntlet. I have never done pvp directly. Claimed a camp one time but that's it. The guy was lvl 100 something and i am lvl 34. I just tried to ignore him and kept building. I eventually had to use a stim but kept ignoring him. He finally gave up and  just logged out. No chat, no emotes. I was confused. I guess he just wanted to start something so he could see if he could one shot me.
---
I'm 53, you young whipersnapper.
---
I agree. Bought it anyway. 
---
"Yo, what weapon was that?"
---
"It's my Two shot instigating bloody 10mm SMG."
---
"That's pretty epic.  How well does it work on deathclaws?"
---
"Wanna see?"
---
\*cue Wouldn't It Be Nice
---
In the armory theres a terminal where if u select the second one down (i think), it gives you the plans to make both the lv40 and lv50 variants 
---
Or at least cap it at 50 when we stop actually getting stronger. If you have another character getting gear for it, a level 50 is just as capable in pvp as a level 300.
---
This is the best thread I've read all day. 
---
Reported
---
This!!! I did it last night for the first time and there were a whole bunch of players participating. I was the lowest level there and I’m sure I probably contributed the least but it didn’t matter, we all had a great time and after we all gave each other the thumbs up emote. It was the first time I’ve interacted with so many players at once! 
---
I've done two parades and I'm really enjoying it.  Lots of people because it's a shiny new thing, and everyone helping out and running around and shooting things and collecting intestines and whatnot.
---
You must live in NJ
---
That's fair, but I'm going to play devil's advocate and inverse what was OP. 
---
If you want to play a non mixed game go play a game that's not pvp oriented or mixed. They are out there
---
Doesn’t toxic valley also have clouds? You are right though it’s probably not an issue that much, I guess I just don’t want the hassle of switching. Maybe if they were more “realistic” or if they had an effect they would be worth it. 
---
Not sure if this was mentioned but i received blueprints for a Fasnacht Bonfire. It's a copy of the one at the event and smolders and smokes. 
---
You don't know how this guy works, take his work out the discussion. He doesn't want or need your advice 
---
Btw if you'd like some advice, keep up the shitty attitude. Makes people want to help you more. 
---
Funny thing is, this subreddit has gotten way more pleasant since the roadmap release. Still way more negative than  [r/fo76FilthyCasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals), but no longer a guaranteed cringefest.
---
Safety first! I'm staying yellow to prevent any nasty hunting accidents..
---
He was unjustly banned, then after Tignus emails to bethesda And after 1 month they unbanned him . Now they banned him again 🤷‍♀️
---
oooh, there is a donut recipe? Where? Do you get that as a reward for the parade? I must have it :D
---
I would agree that by virtue of being in the Forest, they made it easy (see also: why the Grafton Monster is a pushover).  But, imo, they needed to make it scale a bit based on players present when the Sloth spawns.  Not Scorchbeast Queen levels, but maybe something like the Mirelurk Queen where it always takes a little time to kill it.  If you want to keep it easy, don't let it do much damage.
---
10% chance to build wooden foundation.
---
i really want that skull mask. only did the event once so far and got the tooth man mask
---
A couple of weeks ago I decimated a turret camp at WS with like 6-7 orbital strikes.  The owner was actually there at like a lvl 27 or something. 
---
I arrived to farm some ghouls and hear the annoying thumping and blasting as he or she had missile turrets going full bore.  I hope over the roof and end up out back and close the doors.  The camp owner comes back over and opens them.  This sequence went on for about 45 seconds.  All that was missing was the yakety sax song playing in the background. 
---
Finally, the owner gives me a thumbs up (why) and I give him a thumbs down and start lauching strike after strike.  He gives me the question mark emote and I respond with the thumbs up emote.  Good times!  
---
Wow the Fasnacht parade was today? honestly i think Bethesda is doing a good job at still keeping this game alive the only reason why people are saying oh this game is so trash is because of the YouTubers milking the hate train to keep getting views and some YouTubers dont realize that they have a big influence in the community i just love to see some YouTubers still out there making FO76 tutorial videos there are the real ones making a huge positive impact in the community. Anyways cant wait to so the Fasnacht parade 
---
Yeah, I hope they increase the Two shot effect back to 100% DMG, but if they really wanted to balance it at 100% they should make the second bullet do the exact DMG the gun dose^((Not increase the DMG of both bullets)), but have it so the second shot have a marginally reduced accuracy compared to the original bullet, so it's like a second 'chance' shot, or reduce the accuracy of the gun overall.*^((That's just my opinion on the matter at least))*
---
I never duped not once I picked up bags but after my 1200 hours played Beth ended it
---
Presumably because people were at an actual bar
---
53 just checking in
---
A strange rash that sort of looks like Canada.
---
I got a little Fasnatch flag. Got several garlands, "Helvetia" and "Branch". And I learned a recipe for Fasnatch Donuts!
---
Didn't you post this 12 hours ago?  I feel like this sub isn't supposed to be for you to advertise every 12 hours.
---
there is a donut shop next to my office that makes fastnacht donuts and they are awesome!
---
49 here; I sometimes play Quake 3 Arena with my 76 year old dad (Can't convince him to pick up any modern shooters, unfortunately).
---
What about the devil mask? Seen it on one of the robots as well.
---
yup, that's what parades are about. Shooting things and digging out intestines xD
---
Owl mask, love it-twoo. O_O
---
The Beret
---
I believe that's how it is with accuracy already.  I'm still trying to sell my two shots. I have too many.
---
1-star level 35 legendary.  Not worth writing home about at level 95 ;-)
---
I think its bullshit that you can be not at your workshop, like at  your house or at a vendor, and if someone is on a team, they can have one person find you wherever you are on the map, and kill you with no repurcussions.
---
i think the PvP part of Workshops should STAY in the workshops
---
What are your system specs, what Windows version?
---
my shitty attitude? there are many unpolite post here in this 3d, unfortunatly for you, they are not mine.
---
Not sure if it drops. I'll add it as soon as I'm told it's possible. Same goes for the skull mask
---
There isn't a rule that I read against it. Checked several times. Also this is the trading subreddit for fallout 76 so....
---
You need one of all the stable fluxes to craft them at your chemistry station
---
It’s fun, except when people camp the spawn of the sloth and nobody gets a shot
---
Lol.  I do 150.  Just in case...  
---
If I plan on unlocking all of the mods for a new craft weapon, I’ll make a couple of laps around Flatwoods.  Between the logs and the farmhands, I get lots of wood and steel.
---
Otherwise, I only keep about 50 of each because they’re both so easy to come by.
---
I spent the morning watching twin peaks so this is just too much 
---
Are the owl's doing ok 
---
The owl mask.
---
Ah.. 
---
You can also increase damage temporarily with the Adrenaline perk. This increase is shown in the weapon’s info screen so one could make a gun look like it has a high base damage by getting Adrenaline up to the max bonus and then taking a screen shot of the gun’s info. 
---
FYI I also have max Riflemen cards and Bloody Mess and my single shot non-Explosive Levers have a bass damage or 171. 
---
Did you seriously read my whole post, presumably watch the video as well, then create that whole story in order to make me feel like a pansy for moaning about what you consider not to be griefing?
---
Kind of reminds me of that scene in *The Other Guys* where Mark Walburg's character learned to do ballet just so he could prove to the other kids how gay they were.
---
Don't try so hard bro. It makes you look stupid.
---
I've got I think 4 of one mask, so you can get duplicates (and there's a beret, though not sure if that's instead of a mask or an addition to one).  You'll want to do quite a few runs.
---
They have an hour timer on the server (from the start of the event), but you can server hop looking for new ones.
---
They get stored
---
Whitesprings Train station vendor has all four plans
---
I keep 200-400 wood for cooking or random camp stuff. Get it from wood piles next to houses and fallen trees as I go around the map.
---
Steel at 100-200 for weapon armor/repair, but I farm steel from getting basic weapons from heavy populated mob events (Uranium fever/Sons of Dane) and then scrapping.  Iron ore is all over the map on hillsides, so get it as you see it. I use it all up but keep it at 100-200 after making ammo.  Doing this keeps your ammo levels high enough for SBQ and Whitesprings nuke runs.
---
I got pretty annoyed last night because there was a lvl 260 guy who was one shotting EVERYTHING and there were a handful of lvl 20ish players just trying to participate and getting nothing.
---
Yeah, those lvl 20ish players can use the "useless 1* not max level* legendary drops.
---
So even if you are all about finishing the event to server hop to the next, maybe just let the extra few seconds tick to allow lower levels to get something extra out of it.
---
Where'd you get the trident?! Is that new????
---
[CAN I KILL A MAN WITH A TRIDENT NOW?!?](https://youtu.be/Wu7xiJ_HD6c)
---
I already looked up a location that’s in a trailer just a jaunt east of the ash heaps border ,but thank you for offering.
---
Completing the quest only gives you access to the plans on the terminal so you have to select that and it auto populates into your known plans. 
---
Same thing now with ultracite PA. 
---
Well I'd greatly appreciate it if things like this didn't happen!  Oh well.
---
...and STILL no Mr. Pebbles icon. :(
---
I usually keep 300 of each in case a get a wild hair to redesign my CAMP.
---
Just south of Vault 76 is a woodcutters camp that can net you close to 600 wood though with all the logs and wood piles. Steel is so common with virtually every junk item that picking up everything in a few houses should net you plenty. 
---
OwO
---
What weapons do you have Two shots of?
---
Nuka cola plant has a potential for 4 Camden park has the potential for 3
---
Tie between Owl Mask, Donut recipe and Sausage recipe
---
It is also not the right Royal Jelly. The one that Honey beasts drop is classified as Junk and can't be used for cooking unlike the one that spawns in Middle Mountain Cabins which is an Aid item and CAN be used for the recipe. They really need to fix this issue.
---
It does if you wait a little bit
---
I'll preface this with, I'm not trying to be a dick...
---
I usually make it a point to drop all of my junk before fights that I'm likely going to die once or twice. Just a suggestion, as I know it's frustrating. I feel your pain, as I've been there.
---
Yeah I got it as a reward for the parade.  Off the top of my head, the recipe requires salt, spices, frog eggs, milk and two or three other things.
---
I really hope we get information for this soon. I also hope they only allow new characters because people will abuse swapping back and forth between adventure and survival to gain advantages.
---
Haha who needs duct tape?
---
Yesterday there was a bloodied, explosive 50 cal build on the Whitespring golf course who took issue with someone’s camp being there, despite the camp not sitting in the popular ghoul farming spot. In other words this guy just wanted some flat green grass ffs.
---
Anyway, I assume he was bloodied because he maintained a sliver of health while baiting everyone into a fight and doing surprisingly high slap damage to the point that I had to heal myself (I’m Pacifist).
---
After realizing no one wanted to PVP, he leveled this person’s really nice camp. Just shredded it. And it was a dick move. I was considering coming out of pacifist because that sliver of health was tempting, but I did something else instead.
---
While he was focused on destruction, I repaired the heavy machine gun turrets and killed him easily. I didn’t know you could repair someone’s turrets. 
---
Every time he returned , he had a sliver of health again, so I assume he was letting rads keep him low to maintain bloodied. But I just kept repairing and killing him.
---
The witch one, goes well with my current outfit
---
throw the beacon when she lands, then go ham with melee, you can do both
---
Maybe dont carry junk items into a fight with an endgame boss? Or maybe dont play period since you're this upset over it lmao. 
---
I play with my 12yo on PC.  He's my tank and runs circles around me.  I'm 52.  My oldest, 26, is a console player, so we rarely get to game together unless he drops by on a weekend.  
---
We used to tear up the PS and PS2 though.
---
Time to play the event some more, then! 
---
49; first home console was a Sears Roebuck Pong knockoff. My dad (now 76) who was addicted to the [Star Trek game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)) on his mainframe at work got me an Atari 800 for Christmas 1979 when I was 10. He still plays, although I've had a hard time convincing him to play online multiplayer stuff (or anything released this century, for that matter). Closest I getout of him is the occasional game of Quake 3 Arena. So we're not quite the first, but darned close.
---
if there was actual balance in pvp it would be great and fun, but its just 1 shot hits, so.... not so fun
---
;'-)
---
Love it. I'm doing similar with nuka cola skins
---
I’d greatly appreciate it if people accepted the actual world as it works. But that’s not going to happen either. Oh well.
---
Wow, that is awesome... what an amazing exterior. Clever use of the half-wall and triangle pieces. And probably the first time I've seen someone use the inverted full-wall triangle piece.
---
I found a bug that makes your head dissappear
---
No one has gotten the old man winter or jester mask so far, the old man summer mask is in the atom shop though 
---
🎻 
---
Im not super sympathetic since the op literally peppers his post with insults to hypothetical replies. This is 100 percent on him lol
---
No idea, but its the same price as everywhere else.
---
I mean the logic behind capping it at 50 is sound but that they get *any* caps for killing someone is just dumb, I get that by taking a workshop you are agreeing to PvP, but some that take workshops just need the resources and would rather their time wasn't wasted by someone killing them for the caps.
---
Yeah, if there pvp wasn't so lopsided on this game i might not be so salty about it as i honestly don't mind a little sport. It's just not fun though when you can make yourself basically invincible like that or when you can cheat the system by having friends collect your bounty.
---
You called it "griefing" but simply being unfair isn't griefing. Someone killed you and took your PvP objective - that's just PvP gameplay.
---
Don't use workshops if you don't want to engage in PvP at all.
---
If it actually spells something then yes it was intentional. Nice find
---
fair enough!
---
Well Yes, i would highly reccomand you to not carry junk when going fight a endgame boss 
---
craft them. 
---
&gt;!use Ammo smith and Super Duper when crafting bullets to increase yield!&lt;
---
By "old man" do you mean toothy? 
---
Been living there for a while now. SBs generally don’t notice you at all if your camp is actually inside the cave fully. Plus acid is awesome. 
---
Store your shit then.
---
Get a furious version of this and I can kill a player in sent assassins in .3 seconds (confirmed yesterday, nearly poo'd myself)
---
It's a Pitchfork with flamer mod on it! 🔥😈🔥
---
I agree
---
It's great to see the community gathered together in an event and I encourage it. Unlike Scorched Earth you see players of all levels at Helvetia. I'd rather it remain just as busy and simply get some sort of hotfix. 
---
Yeah is one of my favorite things in the game atm, yesterday I did nothing else but being around Helvetia all day waiting for the event to start hanging out with other people and chatting while at it, its a ton of fun to be honest!
---
What platform?  I have a couple hundred rounds I don't need.  We could possibly trade
---
I had two yesterday. They do happen! Just a right place/right time sort of deal :)
---
Dropping items on death has been an option for MMO devs since Runescape at least. Just be glade it is easily gathered junk rather than your weapons and armor too.
---
About half the time, the corpse is just an image of the sloth and therefore not lootable.  You have to find the real body parts
---
How am I the problem? Just wanna do I can stop being the problem. Hmm good to know! It’s just odd how my health will just melt instantly.
---
It’s not a terrible mechanic. 
---
Why farm ammo.
---
Just get Steel, Lead, and the Ammosmith and Super Duper perks.  Steel and Lead are so abundant, you'll have thousands of 5.56 before you know it.
---
Burned thru 4,000 5.56 rounds last night in a Fissure Prime nuke.  Then I was able to craft up 3,500 right after with just my existing pool of Lead and Steel.
---
Scrapper Perk nets a TON of steel now from weapons.  You can get upwards of 20 per assault rifle.  Lead is less abundant, but still available, and you only need about 40-50% as much lead as Steel to get the ammo done.
---
nice.
---
You can go to Poseidon's energy factory and take the workshop there will then be a fusion core maker/generator but first to do that you need to the event powering up Poseidon to get the power box to fuel the fusion core maker/generator hope this helped :)  
---
Equip some power armour with the medic pump, every time your health drops below 50% you’ll automatically use a stimpack, just make sure you have plenty, you’ll die a lot less in SBQ fights even if your swamped with enemies
---
Most are 1 star for sale, Xbox. Flamer, Gatling gun, Pump shotgun, Blackpowder Pistol, grenade launcher, western revolver. 
---
I didn't know I needed this but I NEED this
---
Is this some attempt to keep fake hate at a game going?
---
24 midnights across the globe - an hourly event wouldn't have been ridiculous...
---
Good point.
---
They could have been a looot harsher with death mechanics. Only dropping junk is more than fair
---
Balloons (I’m sooooo happy) 🎈🎉
---
Pretty much anywhere you find a kitchen.  Check diners, trailers like the ones in flat woods, etc.  I know I've seen it in the diner in Watoga, Elly's bunker, the meat house, etc.
---
I'm still under 100, but I've got probably 200+ stims and have *sold* at least 200 in that time.  Ammo I craft, no issue there.
---
I spend a lot of time farming though, as I'm somewhat playtime limited.  Lots of reloading Whitespring.  That helps with ammo and stims (since you can loot stims there and I'm not taking much damage at all in the mall :P )
---
Dope, I'll try that now
---
Since the update bags are in different spots or the diamond marker doesn’t appear but the bag is still there. 
---
I died in Watoga fighting a scorch beast and my bag was inside one of the school bus I was jumping on top of. 
---
I did. I didn't hesitate. I wasn't even sorry. 
---
Great post, lots of information and unique perspectives here. 
---
xbox
---
If someone can get at least one shot on an enemy they get loot even if they don’t kill it. If they get zero shots, they get nothing. Ok, maybe some meat depending on the enemy.
---
Agreed. Imagine the ruined underwear if you dropped ransom weapons or armor not equipped. 
---
Fuck the half of the player base that does this shitty type of griefing. Fuck them and send them onto their own server. No discussion.
---
I'm still doing the event to get the Fasnacht Donut recipe. So far no luck T-T
---
I did get the Witch mask, Owl Mask, Soldier Mask, Giant mask, and the Beret though as well as several of the CAMP plans.
---
IRL Level 53, here!  Older gamers ftw! 
---
so just to be clear, the mask sold in the atom shop is *not* available as a drop from the parade?
---
Update:
---
So I just got the game. 
---
Installing the 50gb patch right now. 
---
Wish me luck
---
I will be playing with a friend and hope that the game is not as bad as the early reviews.
---
Good looking out! 
---
Thank you for the kind words. I'm glad you find this helpful.
---
Watoga:
---
* Potentially two in the monorail station behind a level 3 lock: a fusion generator and a power armor
---
* Potentially one inside Watoga Clinic second floor left room under a table.
---
* Potenitally two on the roof of Watoga Clinic on a power armor.
---
* Potentially one on the roof across the Watoga Clinic near a Vertibird on a power armor.
---
* Potentially one in front of the Watoga AMS HQ next to a Vertibird on a power armor.
---
You could set up your camp near a lead deposit, farm west tek for legendaries (super mutants), scrap every weapon drop (which will give you lots of steel and there are bunches of work benches inside), pickup gunpowder and any ammo dropped. Then craft it using ammosmith and super duper perks. I do this and I get way more ammo than the factory.
---
Very little since wood is literally laying on the ground. And steel is given by so many objects 
---
Sorry. When I said buy perks I meant unlocking them.
---
Sorry, PS4 here.  Like other person said craft them.  Take a work shop with lead and harvest regularly
---
Raid super mutant camps and loot them = Gunpowder
---
Scrap their weapons with the scrapper perk card = Steel
---
Have your camp on a lead deposit and extract it or take a workshop with multiple lead piles = led
---
Craft the ammo with ammosmith perkcard and superduper perkcard.
---
That is what I do. I can make around 2k 5.56 after raiding a few super mutant camps.
---
Line in the Sand event
---
On pc yes, not on console.  
---
Different beasts I guess
---
I've received multiples of the Giant (most common), Toothy Man, Own, Goblin and the Soldier mask and the Berret. I'm not convinced that any other masks even exist, I haven't seen anyone wearing them.
---
Yeah I have the Ultracite PA in the craftable area, I'm about to go back down there and see what's up...thanks for the info!
---
like others have said, I try to have minimal junk on me when going into a dangerous situation, cause even though it’s just junk I still don’t like losing it
---
Now if it was weapons and armor I’m sure everyone would be bitching
---
tnx for the advice
---
The key is stealthboys... I have no fear of bloody melees at range because I can vats crit through assassins/cav or assassins/sent and cause multiple staggers with a single magazine in a just few seconds. Now you add unlimited stealthboys and that entire equation changes, they are as close to unkillable as you get in this game. I "nope" my way out of the fight.
---
Stealthboys are badly in need of a change so they work like they did in FO4. You die, they stop working. You attack, they stop working. You sprint, they stop working. They would still be a great asset for ambushes or bailing on a fight.
---
Well, I think the ATOM shop one is 'Old Man Summer' and this event is about 'Old Man Winter' so probably not.
---
I did the same thing, had to go fight the super mutants again! At least you’ll be able to farm some good junk or weapons to sell! 
---
Power armor with wheels
---
I don't believe so. If I find it or someone else does I will update the list. I'm still farming so I could very will find something new
---
And does it stay with you? Can you take it to combat?
---
It's Levi-O-sa, not Levio-SA.
---
Can you take the balloons or just pop them
---
Here my advice, dont die, and kill stuff.
---
That's  awesome. I play with a guy who is over 60. I think your Dad might like it if he tried it.
---
I had such situation on PC, some guys started shooting when the parade ended. I loved that. Made 1.5k caps from them.
---
No info from bethesda yet so no one actually knows how it will work.
---
I am going to guess it will work sort of like the fermenting machine though. you "loaded" it with stuff from your inventory and it still takes of stash space.
---
Yup. I've had this issue and that's why I don't wear it at the moment. They did fix a previous issue where the Brotherhood Scribe Outfit would get bulkier when wearing the Brotherhood Fatigues underneath as well as where the Scribe outfit would take up the Outfit AND Underarmor slots. Hopefully they fix the clipping issue on the next patch.
---
ugh i'd be farming more,
---
if only i didn't have this *damn job*
---
I've gotten the witch one like 10 times now so I know that ones real. The other unaccountable ones I read from a few other posts. 
---
I googled the pronunciation yesterday for shits and gigs
---
I wanted to make post about it and I believe that it could benefit the endgame. I'm sure gonna start playing again if I can build big settlements.
---
I've noticed this too since Patch 7. Power Armor Fusion cores have been 25% for me in the past 20 hours (10 Luck) but I've noticed some cores laying around must have been on higher charge.
---
It’s the balloon display you see in helvetica with them tied to a base plate, I haven’t tried popping them lol, il have to test it when I log back in later
---
Classic. Attack the person not the debate. You're simply proving my point, tough guy.
---
I set up a few camps like this with all bench’s so anyone could use them... music sleep all that and 4 times they were destroyed by high level players. 
---
Once quests are done players get bored and start doing this... so I stopped until they fix it.
---
Yes there is.  Trust me.  A friend that wrote down the code incorrectly so  I waited in there for 10 minutes while he went back to get a new one.  I pressed the button to let him in.
---
I love the Wooden Inlay paint for the Lever-action. I'm still waiting on my Warhawk to make a return in game and possibly see Gage's Eyepatch in the near future.
---
stash junk...don't keep it on you or you will lose it upon death.
---
Pick up everything
---
People engaging in unwanted PVP causing problems?  Imagine that.  No one could see that coming.  
---
That's pretty funny, actually. The whole server shows up for the event and you're running around with a bounty!? I would have figured you were baiting people and not attacked. 
---
Succulents are going on sale :3
---
Yeah, i did it this way. No time for fermentation.
---
It barely drops good loot which sucks
---
* AMS building - (prepare to fight a lot of turrets) there are 3 fusion generators and one laying around. Outside there's a PA by the crashed Vertibird.
---
* Civic Center - Past the locker room, in the main event floor on the right a PA in the corner.
---
* Emergency Services Building - top floor, after the stairs, left room, a Core next to a enamel bucket and PA on the roof. North of this building is another building with a crashed vertibird with PA next to it (can be seen from the roof of this building).
---
* Transit hub - Fusion Generator and PA behind a level 3 locked door.
---
Total 11 Fusion Cores.
---
Good haul so far! I hope you get that recipe soon! 
---
&gt;P.S. If i start crafting them i will eventually run out since i am limited with resources im lvl 29 currently
---
Place your CAMP at a lead deposit.  That will get you started with the "harder" ingredient in crafting ammo.
---
There are a handful of Lead Deposit locations available in the Forest area, nice and safe.  Two or three of them just west of Flatwoods.  Crafting Gunpowder has high yields to begin with, so you won't need much Acid to do it.  Cloth is a non issue.
---
Even without Ammosmith and Super Duper (or lower ranks of either) you can start to build up plenty of 5.56 ammo.
---
I would suggest grabbing a semi auto rifle and using Sneak attacks and Melee attacks to clear out low level enemies with minimal ammo expending.  Save your 5.56 for relevant content.
---
Lets not forget that glorf is THE "900 hours guy"
---
Yay only a few more decades until total nuclear annihilation! ::heart emote::
---
They have confirmed no player camp damage when in pacifist mode in a previous post, probably same patch as the PVP mode.
---
You might be right, the toxic valley does have those radiation vents but I'm not sure if they cause disease.
---
put on excavator armor go to lucky hole mine (down near BOS asylum) farm lead nodes, smelt them = 800+ lead in 20-30 minutes.  
---
then go to westtek kill all supermutants inside and out put on scrapper and scrap every single weapon = roughly 600+ steel, then go to the BBQ shack kill those and scrap their weapons = another couple hundred.  
---
go to tinkers bench, equip ammosmith and super duper cards craft until empty. = roughly 3000 rounds. this takes roughly 60-90 minutes depending on how fast you can kill things.  
---
jump servers and repeat until your happy with how much ammo you want/need.
---
Just don't use the flat roof part. If you use the peak roof instead, it fits :-)
---
Helpful advice:
---
1. take your time this game is meant to be thoroughly explored,  like all fallout games, rushing to 50+ and grinding away at legendaries gets old real fast. 
---
2. Treat it like it's real,  don't just rush in to every situation not caring if you die.  That really reduces the suspense factor.
---
3. Collect every spring, screw, gear you can find.  You will need them. 
---
Explosive shotgun kids are a cancer like bloodied melee people. *Hur Durr big damage good, me need biggest damage*
---
I know he'd like the soundtrack; it's all stuff he'd sing on long car trips when we were kids. Especially that damned "Shenandoah" song, since we lived in the Iowa town by that name.
---
It gave me its tasty Germanic sausage,  and blight.
---
They were totally worth it at full price to me. You get many variants at so little cost I wanted Bethesda to have my atoms to know that it's a good price point!
---
wait, what is the callback to the classic games?
---
Wood can vary in the wilderness, I’ve had my camp in a couple places where I had to venture a good bit away before finding any, then other locations my camp was literally surrounded by wood on the ground, so now I stock up whenever I can
---
Sounds like you made a macro to exploit item duplication... 900 hours guy? is that you? IT IS!!!
---
I have 3 tse energy weapons and when i trade with randoms, i see them offering me upwards of 15k in caps for one of them. I never take it because they are rare and i enjoy them but since the buff, the tse energy weapons are badass! 
---
you're right. i looked up the atom shop newsletter that people said was pushed yesterday and it confirms that the old man summer mask is an atom shop exclusive, as well as the moon mask.
---
Build defensive structures as in turrets? Dense armor mod and they do no damage. 
---
Choosing to fjght at the workshop? Too bad, I farmed stealth boys so no vats, no hard counter to bloodied assassin/cav or sentinel. 
---
TSE meta? Dense*assassins*above means that bloodied is onky current counter. 
---
I made 6k caps in like 2 hours doing this. That includes farming stealthboys. It took 10 minutes to server hop, kill and block any high level wanted players, then kill and block any high level players at workshops, then restart on a new server. The only time I died was to what I assume was a bloodied rifleman build that got a lucky hit on me when cloaked. 
---
I recognize many people think the above is fine. So long as this system is in place I'm going to abuse the hell out of it to try to get as many people calling for its change as possible.
---
i'm looking forward to some actual content rather than adding jokey events :)
---
I got the challenge but I don't have the suit, this is why I am asking where to get it from :)
---
You can buy the lever action plan in Grafton, then you can craft some and scrap to learn mods.
---
PS: super duper perk helps a lot. ;)
---
Appreciated, but I’m on PC :(
---
No, I haven't!  Though I still think it should be an Atom Store unlock.  What's the plan name?
---
Ones found in the wild on Chassis appear to always be 25% since the Patch 7 update.  Either unintended bug or stealth nerf.
---
You'll want to go after the power plant workshops and power up those fusion core generators.  Won't take very long to get a handful of 100% cores, and it'll last you a while.
---
What platform are you on? I have some extras if you want them
---
Thanks man, but I’m on PC :(
---
I can't speak to any empirical data but last night it seemed like my gatling laser and laser rifle were still tougher than before.
---
I turn 47 next month. PM me here and I'll send you my Bethesda.net username if you ever want to game together! (Honestly I haven't started much of the main questline yet and I'm level 70, my other character is level 51)
---
Thing is, I don’t have enough caps to afford it but thanks for the tip
---
I got the owl and the witch my first, soldier every one since. Lol
---
Find a low population server and take two powerplant workshops. You don't have to do the powering up events, just drop enough generators (or 1 fusion gen.) to power it.
---
You can get 16 per hour. 
---
Does the beacon not damage the person who threw it? I usually run with less than 20% health and would hate to get dropped by my own grenade.
---
That's an exoskeleton, not really a Suit of Armor. 
---
Yea I don't even fight back, I just stand outside and ask them why... Usually the reply is "this is the endgame brah".... 
---
Did the event 6 times last night. Sloth was unlootable every time. I clipped right through it. Lots of people having trouble with it. I'll look for a head next time.
---
I'm excluding any masks from the atom shop and I no one has confirmed if we can get the Skull mask or Devil mask yet so I'm holding off on adding them.
---
Played it once and got witch mask and flag pole plan
---
Unless you build up a elaborate workshop set up, it really does not take a bunch of resources. Any of the resources in green when building are provided by the workshop, white are provided by you. I think last time I claimed a workshop I was able to build all benches and like 5-10. Turrets before I had to start using my own resources. 
---
Typically, things for sale in the Atom store aren't obtainable in game. You also can't sell or trade them. That would include Old Man Summer (red devil looking mask) and Moonshine Mama (missile in eye) masks "... which are only available in the Atomic Shop" quoted from Bethesda's Atom Shop update. ([https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop))

10? I was on all last night and couldn’t do but one because the servers kept crashing. 
---
I have a slide rule! I don't really use it but I have one. 
---
I love that side effect :) yesterday my buddy and I toasted to another dead scorchbeast queen with some vintage nuka shine. We thoroughly enjoyed being teleported out of the nukezone to separate random locations. I think it’s become a tradition of ours.
---
The best thing the event gave us... one of my teammates now can make sausage jokes all night, since he got the recipe in the first attempt and hasn't stopped.
---
(Or that could be the worst thing... not 100% sure yet).
---
One run in lucky hole mines in excavator armor can net you about 417 lead ore. There are iron nodes all over the mountains in the savage divide. ALso use excavator armor on those.  You'll need a lot of acid which you can get from workshops, certain creature kills, beeswax, and scrapping. Smelt the ores and collect gunpowder from super mutant spots or craft it.
---
With superduper and ammosmith maxed out you can pop out 3 to 5k bullets effortlessly. I use 3 weapons primarily and have about 3k bullets for all of them all the time. 
---
THAT. IS. AWESOME!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Freddy_Fear%27s_House_of_Scares
---
Confirmed on the wiki you have a Clown suit and hat inside.
---
Guided Meditation event  in savage divide spawns three waves of super mutants. Each Mutant always has 2-10 caps and 5.56 ammo
---
then i cant run because i carry too much stuff. The only reason i can fast travel and run is the bug where when logging off while wearing PA and loggin back on you get the carrying bonus twice. I got too much stuff on me and my storage is full and i hate the idea of mule characters. Hopefully this ends when the legendary vendor arrives and i can sell all my hoarded legendaries so i can get their effects crafted on nicer items.
---
The game has bugs but it is cool. Better than half the garbage I played in the last year.
---
School let out, and the kids showed up to ruin things.
---
Agree. I want to be able to fast travel after the event. So....much....junk....
---
No, that’s not what Fallout is about.
---
Anyone on PC have an extra Fasnacht Balloons and/or the Beret?  I've been grinding it all I can, but still haven't gotten one to drop....
---
Also if you're low level, and have your own excavator armor I'll gladly run Lucky Hole Mines with you and help you find all the lead. Theres usually only a few level 40 mole miners but I'm down to assist if you need it. 
---
I'm ammo maker for my team so I know a lot of good spots for resources. 
---
Just throw on a mask with it and you'll be fine. That's what I did.
---
Adventure. PVP is completely unbalanced in this game when people with the right legendaries and cards can all but one shot you if they get the drop. That's not fun at all. I love PVP, and I PVP in almost every game I play... but it's so unbalanced in Fallout 76 that it's not worth the challenge to me.
---
also one loose one in the highschool the chemistry room.
---
My base always gets taken by sweaty lvl 150s tho and I’m only lvl 56
---
Pick up stuff, use what you want, scrap the rest so it becomes junk, store the junk in your trunk! 
---
Follow the main quest for a little while to gain some easy early levels and basic introduction to systems like cooking. 
---
Build a simple camp with a bed, cooking station, storage trunk, weapons and armor workbenches, and an instrument as soon as you find a plan for one. 
---
Build you camp somewhere with easy access to food. I built mine by Silva homestead right after I finished the flatwoods main quests because there is corn and water there for corn soup! 
---
Sleep for bonus xp gain 
---
Use a melee weapon to save up ammo. Use pipe guns to start off as early enemies drop ammo for them. 
---
Also to get a wendigo around just follow the road to go south, at a moment there a big tree branch mixed with a car crashed on the road, most of the times a Wendigo is on the branch and it will from it to attack you.
---
Indeed, i was just saying that i didn't notice. You seem to be well versed in english too,so it shouldn't be a problem. But yeah i get that many others will have an issue with this.
---
Yes, a user posted this morning.  Nothing all that different other than if you get the intestine bot, you have to go outside the nuke zone to gather them and bring them back.
---
They said no other legendaries spawned.
---
Its the wurst... 
---
It isn’t the trading subreddit...this is the official Fo76 sub
---
Sorry I wasn't more clear. I do not mean turrets. Those are useless. I mean literally building big multi-level structure with false doors, etc. I usually build it around whichever resource node I am interested in and I craft a fast travel mat in it so that once it is built, I only fast travel in and out of workshop. This means I never have to leave the structure except to kill mobs in defense events.
---
I had one of these dummies come up to me in New Gad while helping a buddy find the civil war reenactor.  I don't think he liked me yawning and laughing at how unimpressed I was.  He got mad and left.
---
I believe OP is referring to the Sun mask that the beekeeper wears and not Old Man Summer.
---
Do your civic duty and smash the turrets!!! :)
---
Watoga EMS top floor next to operating table on a metal shelf.
---
I played Zork, and started gaming with pong in like 1980!
---
Watching the progression of games, and PCs in general has been a huge part of my life (I am 43) but they have always kind of been there, even if they were something you played less of back in the day.
---
i never keep more than 100-150 wood at any given time, unless i am planning some weapon crafting or moving camps.   
---
steel i try to keep 300-600 since i craft alot of ammo. hit about 600 steel and i know i can turn that into 2-3000 rounds of ammo usually. then when out i hit westtek for more so i have enough for weapon repairs and such.
---
You can easily rejoin a server on xbox using the in-game recent players menu, view profile, join game. But you won't own the workshop anymore when you rejoin.
---
go through the list, see what you have the most of, that item you use the least, also you don't need more than 100 of most resources, a few are good to keep above that number though, but you should have some piles with over 300 and those are the piles that can be pared down.
---
That atom symbol is the only way I can find my Mothman x01 in my stash. 
---
I love seeing griefers, dupers and russians getting banned then complaining about it.
---
Just level the base and get a mate to claim the bounty and give you the caps back.
---
Yeah, well they'll have to do something about it next month when they make pacifist camps un-destroyable.  They either have to make a no-build zone or something like this.
---
I hate to say it, but you do have a very negative attitude.  Take a break from the internet.  Go frollick in the flowers.
---
Looks like the Power Loader from Aliens.
---
52 here. Hell yea, The Brotherhood AAPR Chapter. I am down with that. 
---
Still professional
---
Oh cool ill do that next time it crops up
---
It completely broke the quest for my group. We did all the pre parade crap and then just as the parade started we got the nuke warning. So many pissed off people. 
---
Never enough. That's how much I keep.
---
I never thought that Steel and Wood would be what I'm farming for post 50+. I have so much ultiricite, stable flux, titanium, and lead I have to keep bulking it and selling. I find so much of everything else while farming steel and screws.
---
See my reply above
---
sure, just wait literally 2 seconds for the strike, then go attacking, also it's usually the first thing you do in the SBQ fight, after hitting her with Endangerol, and if you die you shouldn't have anything on you and will respawn right next to her.
---
thanks. Infact as I told, the problem is for my 8 years old child. If I set ps4 into english also his fortnite and apex will be patched in english too....
---
It’s not supposed too, it’s bugged atm. It used to be fun to use 
---
No he was banned for violating ToS be it by duping or some other violation but hey keep on whining and saying he "didn't do nuffin" just like all the other banned players didn't deserve it.
---
FYI here's what happened they let him/ her play for a month while they reviewed the ban. They found clear violations of ToS and reinstated the ban.
---
Build a bridge get over it.
---
FYI You have the right to be angry about the Italian language causing crashes. That's BS but not the ban.
---
Yes, Bethesda Game Studios.
---
What kind? I just dropped a ton yesterday. Does it do more than make fertilizer now?
---
yep we had a server crash last night right when the light bonfire option came up. 
---
Would you be so kind to include some screens of the camp thingies for those of us, who won't be able to get in game anytime soon?
---
Everything mentioned plus.
---
If a high level drops a brown bag in front of you, steps back and tries to draw your attention to said bag, it’s probably a gift for you, pick it up.
---
Unlock the different factions vendors asap to help maximise how many caps you can make daily. 
---
Read the maps in train stations, 
---
Get it to the habit of bulking junk to make saleable items. 
---
Read everything in the terminals, enjoy the stories.
---
Don’t drink nukashine then try and hug a wendigo.
---
You can make 1400 caps a day selling junk/weaps to the vendors, the easy way to make caps...
---
i kinda second this. i was playing for a bit, the server i was on started getting  hit with the classic details of a duper on the server, so I had tried to jump servers. couldn't join off of my friend, so I figured I relog. Then bam, couldn't.
---
I'm 53, my wife plays nothing but she does not begrudge me my decompression time at the end of the day. That's what love is.
---
From people who have different opinions
---
43 year old Whipper snapper myself.. and outside two kids who aggressively tried to get me to join them, never had an issue myself. I make sure to wave to anyone I see and help who I can.. I wish they'd let us start guilds/raider/Responders groups.. 
---
What country?
---
Try to set language from game/console to english.
---
I hope it helps
---
Companionship
---
sorry i meant the witch, not the goblin
---
it isn't rare just uncommon. It occasionally spawns in Appalachian Antiques in Cranberry Bog as well as Flight Helmet, Brotherhood Fatigues, and Medical Goggles.
---
You got one shot from full hp when you weren't flagged for pvp?
---
It's a risk you take, makes the game more tense.  No need to sanitize the game.
---
They lied to you! Lots of owl masks around. Many people are getting doubles of the masks and theres a lot of trading after the parade. If you don't get one you can probably find someone who did and has one already.
---
That's actually a pretty smart way around it, but I still think it's a shame that the workshops are such a small part of the game now. I just can't think of any of the resource nodes I would be willing to put that level of effort in to. As it stands workshops are never really worth it from a resource perspective.
---
I finally got my first Grognak Axe, always wanted one but never found a plan to craft it or a legendary drop. My second Fasnacht dropped one for me but on the downside its just a lvl 35 ... and has the executioner effect.
---
I mean I know I purchased $20 of atoms to give a little support.  I mean these are things they are supposed to be doing anyway but if I like where something is heading, I give a little more support. 
---
Love it 
---
"Trading" doesn't always just mean item-for-item.  You trade for caps or use a reputable middle-man. 
---
And people do commonly sell ultra-rare items that they don't plan on using. You just gotta know where to look. Check market-76 and the training discord servers. Cheers
---
Thanks! I'm L98 on XBox, L51 in real life and an actual West Virginia resident. Man the roads aren't much different!. 
---
Anyone know how long it takes to ferment??
---
I found them, it's on the terminal in the armory...just had to pick the Prototype PA option and it went on automatically 
---
Well you and your friend are the only ones saying that. Also you are the only ones who replied with rude manners
---
Ok cool. Thanks. I’ll be on around 10-11am PST. 
---
At least we get to drink alchol at any age ehehe.
---
That's pretty cool, didn't know that.
---
I often think that people that missed the cynical humor of that time probably have a harder time catching some of the nuance in the early games.
---
I had to do nuclear attack drills at school as a kid and monthly air raid tests were still a thing till the wall came down, so I was entirely primed by the experience to totally fall in love with fallout when it released.
---
I honestly think I'd do more damage to her in those 2 seconds than the orbital. Not to mention the loss of dps from respawning. Still, I think I'm going to try it just to gauge its effectiveness next time I run her.
---
I’m definitely going to buy it, but then I may need to keep the OG paint just to stand out. 
---
You say Tato. I say trado!
---
Shame :( thought it might've done something 
---
The world would honestly be a lot better off without assassins / sentinels / cavalier gear, and damage in pvp should be toned down so that one shotting isn't a thing.
---
he should wait until 50 to do mayor for a day so his all rise will be lvl 50. its a real good melee weapon for even non melee builds to carry around with them as a back up weapon. 
---
Yup it happens occasionally. I got a Bolstering Leather Right Arm.
---
It’s such an infrequent occurrence, though. And if that statement isn’t true for your play style then carry a mask or helmet with you
---
Hmm, what type of Grenade Launcher is it?
---
That's why any good bloodied build will rock adamantium bones rank 3, sadly.
---
Are you from Europe? EU servers are having some trouble right now and you can't play the game. I've posted a thread for this problem ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b322jg/my\_game\_crashes\_every\_time\_i\_log\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b322jg/my_game_crashes_every_time_i_log_in/)) and seems that Bethesda is already working in a solution.
---
Meanwhile, try this solution. It worked for me:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b39wwj/pc\_all\_who\_have\_game\_crashes\_in\_main\_menu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b39wwj/pc_all_who_have_game_crashes_in_main_menu/)
---
I’m going to try to do a specialized store. Mostly plans and outfits 
---
Because kids get given gaming consoles for Christmas, but they have to be older to build a capable PC to game on.
---
or just make it like most other unique locations where you can't build
---
OP, you are both rude and stupid, terrible combination
---
It was really fun. Lots of brown bagging going on, also.
---
Ah! Okay, so that means it isn't intentional and hopefully will be fixed
---
I’ve run into the Insult Bot before, but besides telling me to stop, it didn’t do much. :-/
---
I've just literally launched my first... Tried previously and been unsuccessful so I waited... Lvl 104 I am, tried many ways but was weak and losing junk so I thought fuck it I'll wait. So geared up with Sentinel Assassins Armor and Anti Armor handmade... And boom, I did it. Hard work if I'm honest, especially with a Pvp build, no hazmat or power armor. 
---
I was going to nuke the new quest, faschnact but some friends were partaking in it so did whitespring for all to enjoy. 
---
Going to do another later, and go fight the queen, done her before but never launched a nuke myself, even better I did it alone. 
---
Watch out for the Assaultron Defender at the end, didn't expect her and she beemed me up. Wasn't stood still when I should of been. 
---
Maybe if it was 250 atoms but all it is a red version of a mask your already able to wear on the game?
---
Excuse me let me be more proper... ehhh hmmm.. " I posted in the official Fallout 76 subreddit  using the trade or trading flasher within the title.
---
I run n unyielding bloody build but I’ll guarantee that you won’t see my setup online like these kids that you’re talking about. They think that they are indestructible and most end up dead because they don’t understand the mechanics of the build and armor. That’s their downfall for following the YouTube crowd. I ran into one last week and got him to result to going in his x01 armor, just to be one shot again. 
---
False, its an active effect
---
The goblin fasnacht mask and the hooded skeleton mask were being sold on the market not long ago.
---
I posted this in the other thread about age, here it is again:
---
Old Guy's Rules of the wasteland
---
1. I'm gonna get mine. Then I'll help you get yours.
---
2. If you start a fight, I'll finish it.
---
3. I may not like you, but the odds of survival are better in numbers.
---
4. I got more time in a set of T-60 than you have in a T-shirt.
---
5. Shut up and shoot.
---
6. Nobody knows it all, but you gotta at least GOFO (grasp of the f**king obvious).
---
7. When all else fails, FIDO (f**k it, drive on).
---
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer.
---
52 years old and still learning the ropes. Finally learned what reddit was,lol. 
---
Yep! I gonna be medic! Already got my Medical Wing! ;) 
---
You're right, at the moment it seems like it's scaled for a few people which could have been a good thing if not many people show up but when the whole server shows up it needs to scale to the occasion.
---
yep ,   
---
reactive should be better but I have not noticed much 
---
I was at low health and afk at vault 76 in pacifist mode , fingered I was safe to go to bathroom and I walked In seeing the death claw build chopping me down and steal my loot.   So I msg him and asked why and he says yo I’m top of the food chain thanks for the bulk 
---
What? Strange in numbers is bugged? didn't know this. Never taken it off since I have a ton of mutations. I run a full set of unyielding armor at low health, so my stats are always high.
---
You’re f***ing with me right
---
Certainly there were plenty of Aiden2009’s that weren’t out drinking and would have loved to squeak their ways over to Whitespring if it was worth it.
---
Anyone else have "Event Failed" when everyone is standing around waiting for the thing to start? Several XBox players were upset this morning! 
---
Does selected add the dot next to it? 
---
Don't cut yourself on all that edge, hun.
---
Does that make you immune? I’ve only had my Dragon crit fail to stagger once, and I’m not sure it even registered the hit. 
---
It was fun to do the event, but for them saying the masks are "random and rare", I now have two of the same mask and my wife got one of her two masks the same as mine.
---
I have a feeling I'm going to wind up with a lot of the toothy grin masks when I just want that Sun mask and my wife wants the Owl.
---
Also I can see the reason why it's something that will only be around for a week.  It takes at least 2-3 people to barely beat the mission unless you show up RIGHT as the event starts.  With only 20 some odd people per map (assuming your map is full, 24), if only half or less of the population show up, it's going to be tough to keep repeating it over and over again.
---
I did like that some of the enemy waves seem to vary.  There were a lot of radtoads and suicider super mutants, but the last enemy wave was wolves on one event and a megasloth on the other.
---
What a surprise that they're trying to push people into the direction of cash shop.
---
The small one. Break barrel.
---
Nice! Someone was just lamenting about how they couldn't use existing structures in fort building, but this is a great find.
---
I got the beret in addition to a mask 
---
I clearly should have embraced my inner jerk more.
---
Dude, the kids swear like sailors in this game. It is always jarring hearing a cherubic voice going all Dice Clay on you.
---
Bethesda have enough problems with our cache, so vending machines are going to be hilarious. 
---
Long story short, Anti-armor does more damage against heavily armored opponents (like super mutants) and 2 shot does more damage to lighter ones (like scorched)
---
I want the owl mask so hard, but only got two giant masks and two witch masks
---
yup and its one of the few things that you can put on tables to make your camp not look so empty 
---
I want vendor bots. One for weapons and armour, one for good and meds... you get the point, and it’s only wishful thinking. Regardless, I’ve already pretty much maxed my camp budget building a bar, diner and shopping complex lol.
---
Same.  I think everyone was going full melee during both parades I did.  I used my 10mm so I could stand on the roof and just get a hit in until the suiciders.  We lost 2 robots during that part in round 2 and then everyone got out their 2SE.  
---
"I wish ..." sums up Fallout 76.
---
Hi all, we're investigating and actively working to address this issue as soon as possible.
---
A hangover
---
Right? I love the look of that one
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
I couldn't tell at all by your username.
---
That’s were I’d just come from, too. Way OP
---
Also if your on Xbox I can help you farm caps. Fast. 
---
As for stims I make a steady amount with workshop defenses. I personally think workshop defense is the most efficient way to get them. I have the recipe if you want it. I got it for free, workshop lol. Don't have need for it. So if you're on Xbox then it's yours. 
---
I read somewhere that speed boost was capped at 20% and can’t go higher no matter what you do. Speed demon covers that 20%.
---
Wilderness survival stuff. Healing Salves, Desease Cures, stuff like that. If I can actually get recipes.
---
Prob Fort Defiance.  That's where my husband got his.  That mask spawns there all the time.  
---
Yeah, it has been broken since patch six unfortunately, hopefully they’ll get it right soon! I miss being able to jump high.
---
I’ve missed everything damn work 😢
---
I stay on the roofs and VATS Suiciders with my Black Powder Pistol that I can. Speed Demon makes using that pistol much more tolerable. Once the event is over, I loot the stuff I killed and chill on a rooftop/kill Scorched until the Event starts again. Surprisingly effective, and lately I've been seeing more people doing it.
---
Totally agree, the PvP needs serious work. That said, guy who wasn't invunerable sorta sucked. Kept seeking revenge, so I could just keep killing them and then after they finally found me, they failed to kill me point blank with a TSE shotgun and then got one hit by my gauss in return. Karma, i guess \^\^ 
---
I looked there because someone told me the same thing but it’s not there.
---
I mean, it one shots nearly everything in the game, it took a nice chunk of the Queen's health last time I used it on her...
---
I can try to, it may be a bit hard for me as I am on Xbox. But I will try :)
---
Yes, enemies spawn at higher level so glowing lvl 40 radtoads, and level 40-68 scorched and mutants. Besides that everything is the same.
---
Imagine you could give all those rolling pins, drills, lead irons to settlers.. like in fo4, that was the most joy in that game for me.. getting the gear for my army
---
Yep. They make for a tougher opponent but they are still easy to stagger. Same with Cavalier. My real issue is stealth boys.
---
I'll pick it up unless I know the player who dropped it, then I'll guard it or pick it up and give it back. 
---
I wish winter was obtainable but it seems bugged atm
---
Nope but one event I did about an hour ago had 50 seconds left and the robots were almost there and then... boom... event failed. But they were so close. Just walked slow 
---
It should be. I got a legendary version of the rifle yesterday.
---
three purified = one boiled cuz of evaporation :D
---
Once we lost the second robot almost everyone jumped up to do that.   Speed Demon + Marsupial is my life.  &lt;3 &lt;3 it makes all guns better.  
---
Yeah, I was less than thrilled when I saw that and it turned out to just be a plain minigun
---
Cause reddit
---
And I thought that at 52 years old, I was the old man on the beat! Glad to know I am not alone!
---
I heard about it a bit ago but it’s a long wait lol, I’m ok with the idea of slap damage, but the alert makes the concept of slap damage redundant. Once slap damage and pacifist is completely invulnerable to pvp I’ll finally have no complaints besides bugs.
---
Thanks I’ll check it 
---
Anti-Armor does more damage to more heavily armored opponents.  So low armored opponents are damaged more by 2 shot, but by the time you get up to super mutants and above, the anti-armor is doing more damage.
---
Can confirm, I got one after 10+ events.  You know how it usually drops a mask and a plan? Well it replaced the plan reward, so I got a mask and the baret.
---
Those mutations are the best imo and no one can tell me otherwise 😂😂😂
---
I'm not 100% sure about that one. I saw someone say it was available on another post but I'm not quite sure yet.
---
I'm hoping we're going to be able to sell ammo.
---
 Since the beginning of the game I have only used 2 kinds of bullets. .45 and .556.  I'm currently level 130.
---
 Since I save every bit of ammo I find I have mass amounts of almost every other kind of ammo.
---
 If they don't let us sell ammo I'm just going to dump my entire stash full of ammo.  I would have so much more Room in my stash.
---
 But other than ammo I am pretty much going to sell whatever I can.
---
I agree!
---
always wait till level 50 to get unique weapons, especially All Rise.
---
Mother's milk
---
I already built a public tavern/bunkhouse/workspace. The player vending is a bonus, so i'll just sell whatever miscellanious stuff i can. But given i made a tavern, and currently you can only nake your own drinks, im probably gonna make a bunch of booze and food to sell, too.
---
It was recently sold on the market
---
Owl take 2!  
---
owo  
---
I cooked something that gave me +10 melee but I forgot what it was since I don't melee.
---
&gt;im just bitching about a terrible mechanic that's deterred interest since launch
---
Your interest maybe, everyone else has adapted and has no issue with it.
---
One thing to keep in mind is you can blueprint the structure, so it's not hard to redeploy it most of the time. I usually just get lead or steel nodes running and then use the workshops as free fast travel points. They're way more useful at low levels because the xp will level you up quickly, but I still take them on my high level main because it's a good way to have lead or steel trickling in while I'm idle. I do wish that the resource yields were better, but then again that would attract even more pvp.
---
How do you farm caps fast? I'm so tired of vendor run circuits taking 30-45 minutes every time I log in.
---
Look on the bright side, it's Waaaaaaay easier than it used to be. Back in beta and the first month or so, it spawned like.. ten times the robots it does now....All those freakin gutsies are gonna haunt my nightmares, I swear. 
---
People will contend a workshop while the new Fasc event is going on, knowing someone won't want to leave the event or the server as they will lose progress towards a reward, especially if they are already in the thick of it. The  team will also have teammates already at the event ready to take you down as soon as its ends and we go neutral to each other. 
---
So pretty much a team of 3 to 4 players can have 1 or 2 people go around and claim all of the owned workshops towards the middle/end of the event, and since everyone has been going to these events they are all in one place while a couple of guys watch them waiting for the opportunity to strike. 
---
At the exact point the event ends the teammates launch a few AA mini nukes to cause confusion while the rest of the team fast travels in, then all hell breaks lose. 
---
Since people who claim workshops never seem to see the notification that they are flagged for PVP, they may not even be aware they are about to be farmed for caps. 
---
So having claimed workshops if you plan on being committed to the Fasc event might not be the best idea if you don't want to lose a pile of caps. 
---
Source: There are people on a discord I frequent who are planning to do this.

once you get to the point where you're not worried about dying with out a helmet on catching and living with disease isnt really much of an issue as it is an inconvenience.

Between Watoga High School and Watoga Shopping Plaza there is a bus at one of the bus stops that spawns a Stealth Boy as well as a Magazine and common outfit. It is parked to the left on the street (not the parking lots) with two trash cans on either side under the bus stop.

I keep 10 bulk stacks of more used resources, 6 of less common.  Non bulk junk I keep 80 of each.  Excess I sell.  Ballistic Fiber and plastic I keep all.
---
I’ll gladly accept a Wanted tag to smash someone’s camp at the clubhouse.  Leaving camps open to damage makes the most sense - it’s a player-based solution to a player-created problem.  This leaves the developers more time to focus on actual broken content and new content.
---
I try to switch to passive when fighting SBQ or nuked areas, keeps people less pissed at me.
---
im a vats sniper, run with 4 lever actions, AAE, TSE, AA, EXP, all their numbers are roughly about yours, think my AAE, and TSE hit round 220ish. she is lvl 225 max all relevant perks so your weapon dmg is normal, you want quick kills put on criticals card and gunfu, you can headshot 68 supermutants in one hit.  
---
as others have said to get 500's and up you would have to make a bloodied build, get a bloodied lever action, unyeilding armor, nerd rage, radicool, adrenal reaction, then get yourself irradiated so that about 3/4 of your health bar is radiation, and it will give you 500+ dmg per shot, but something breathes on you and youre dead, its a true glass cannon. 
---
That is the goblin mask
---
Just wait for it to go on sale /s
---
Yep was gonna post the same thing. Can’t find the original place I read it though. The guy had run down the long hallway inside whitespring and timed it and found there was a cap and if you had speed demon mutation nothing else would make you run faster than that. You could only set your perks up to make you run longer. 
---
Might I suggest writing (confirmed) or (unconfirmed) next to them based on if any screenshots have been provided?  I've done a bunch if events and still haven't seen anyone wearing some of them.  I hope they are obtainable but so far I've only seen the "rare" ones on the protections, not on players.
---
Do you utilize the finely tuned - status effect ?  Playing a musical instrument ...  also well rested ?  And there are some food builds that contribute to faster refill on so.  Other ideas - sprinting uses less ap perk.   
---
Huzzah! A man of quality! I had a pretty little brick home that got nuked yesterday.
---
Oh, I thought that they’d already increased the whitespings no build zone? I’ve not seen a turret camp there for ages.
---
CAMP goals right there...damn
---
So I have to build with a even number of foundation pieces to have it look nice.
---
Happened during one of my runs. Everyone was shoving it for several minutes until someone managed to physically interrupt the pathing loop. When logic doesn't work, brute force is the way to go.
---
Dang man that’s super cool
---
yeah, the dataminer did a shit job of letting everyone know there is lore here, he just said where to get each piece.  tbf he did say there was some lore but didn't say how to find it, just skipped straight to the first key.
---
Has everyone else has said, crafting it is the correct answer.
---
However, if you're wandering down in the Ash Heap, there's a destroyed sentry bot in Welch in the lower end of town that has a bunch of 5.56 on it. Not sure if the amount changes from instance to instance, but I got \~75 rounds off of it.
---
Don't know if server hopping reloads it.
---
Good info, thanks!
---
It's used to make the sausage in the new recipe.  Intestines, Spices, Spoiled Meat, something like that.
---
"Value" is a bit of an overstatement.  As the new recipes are not all that fantastic.  Donut is just 15% food, Can't remember what sausage is, but no one is going to be coveting it.
---
It's more "has use beyond fertilizer now" but not a valuable use.
---
When is this sale happening?
---
You know that night stalker daily event where you have to make noise to lure the wendingo? Photo mode is a must there.
---
I had the same issue...scorched just interrupting my building non-stop. Now that you can place 10 turrets, I wonder if it is worth trying again?
---
That would be nice, but I simply want some sort of armor penetration for energy weapons.  If my wimpy level 35 combat rifle can one shot higher level ghouls (with sneak attack) then the laser rifle that I'm holding that does more base damage should as well....
---
47yo checking in... playing since Wasteland on my Apple II.  #oldschoolgamersFTW  
---
Glad you posted.
---
Some of the most interesting photo ops have no room for your camera, unfortunately.
---
fashishstash.... faschesmash.... erm... fasnashtisma....no........ eh what ever......Faschishnashicmash you say....
---
PvP is available, but other players can’t really hurt you (only slap damage) unless you engage back or take a workshop, for example. You can turn in pacifist mode which prevents you from damaging others accidentally. 
---
Players can damage your CAMP, but it’s on Beth’s list of things to ‘amend’.
---
Apparently you can find it in the frat houses now, so at least it's an easier drop.
---
I cottoned on to this after a few parades today, but without wanting to travel to my camp in the mire I got the civil war suit from the museum and donned the owl mask!
---
davvero!?!?
---
non sono riuscito a giocarci ieri ma non avevo idea di questo problema
---
Played once so far and only got Confetti Pile plan.
---
We're high levels.
---
Plenty of advice about getting mats in here already, but i'll add that if you hit up the flatwoods gym followed by the gyms in the silos, you'll have a hell of a lot of lead without having to use up acid smelting it. Though you will have to fight some wimpy robots. 
---
Nice to know I’ve been doing it right
---
Amen 
---
there is also a welded rebar for the excavator armor.  
---
You cannot. But it could be that you cannot damage your stuff.
---
Maybe other players can.it would be an easy way to get someone wanted if they pop easy.
---
&gt; An idea for Bethesda to solve the Whitespring turret camp issue
---
Cheap orbital strike becons for sale at the Black Powder shoppe?
---
A group tried that.  Pushing.  Running into it.  Shootings.  Beating with blunt options.  Throwing grenades.  Fucker was committed to his circle.
---
I'd rather snipe the suiciders before they ever get close - sorry 
---
As it stands now,  if someone comes up to you and attacks, the slap damage nullifies so much of the damage that it takes a concentrated effort to "murder" them. It's easy to just fast travel or change servers if you think you have no chance against them in PvP (you probably have a good chance of killing them,  since you will have the initiative,  but that's a different topic). 
---
To change it significantly will make the player seeing  player "tension" they talked about completely void, since there would be no damage at all.  Yes, the "Survival" mode is coming out, but that should enhance the danger aspect of the game, not completely nullify all interpersonal violence in the base game.
---
That's my opinion, and I was mostly just messing with you yesterday to see how you'd react.  I'm not a child, and if I were on XBox, I'd take you player hunting with me to show you how fun it can be when it's a relatively mutual combat experience (i.e. I'm not going to sit there all day hitting someone to try to get them to PvP, if they are interested,  they will usually reciprocate an attack fairly quickly)
---
There,  now you've had my thoughts,  since you seem to actually kind of care,  which is kind of cool actually. 
---
I don't understand why it turns into a PvP free for all after the event.
---
Yep
---
Guilty as, uh, duh...
---
Totally agreed! Lighting system needs a revamp. Sadly, I think they won't do anything with this aspect of game engine anytime soon... Hopefully, official mods support will help to address at least some of the issues like poor lighting range/coverage you mentioned.
---
Why not?
---
Not had that happen once and have done it 9 times now (PC)
---
I'm just gonna bend my extra stuff, every category. And just see how it goes. I am on a clifftop with a lead deposit and don't really want to move. So walking there will put some off. My hope is people will temporarily team up and ft there, trade, then unteam. But I'm prepared to adapt if necessary. 
---
When you’re killed by another player, only your junk is available to be looted.  Your weapons, apparel, aid, etc are safe.  Get in the habit of scrapping all your junk then stashing it, and you’ll be fine.
---
Everyone has a stash box that is only accessible by them - you can build one of these at your camp and they’re also scattered throughout the map.  I can use someone else’s stash box but only ever access my items.
---
That sounds eminently logical. Oh well :(
---
So Im LVL-29 and tonight for the third time I will be hosting a stash box garage sale. typically I go to a train station vendor and start messaging all the low level players on my server. I typically breakdown all the weapons and armor so Its feed chems and broken down junk.
---
so I have two stupid questions. does bulking really save space? Im being a cheapskate as I am constantly  running out of  plastic.
---
the last question is subjective, but what heavy weapons are worth keeping. I almost never use heavy weapons, but still end up hoarding them.
---
broadsider, RPG, .50 cal machine gun, minigun (both styles), laser rifle, gamma ray gun, plasma gun, Alien blaster with no ammo
---
&gt; 9.NO WITCHUNTING  
---
&gt;No  witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and do  not accuse players of cheating. Use Bethesda's official support page to  report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/).
---
Pvp griefers still exist but they’re few and far between, mostly the community is really nice and will go out of their way to help. 
---
This also applies to your camp, at almost lvl 100 I’ve had my camp attacked twice by people just acting like dicks, had goodness knows how many other players have visited and the interaction has always been awesome.
---
The only items people can steal from you are junk you haven’t stored, everything else is safe.
---
Hope this helps and you have a great time.
---
Right.  The only thing I see is people opening their PipBoy and dropping duplicate masks/plans/etc
---
You do not need to do the powering up event.  That merely makes power available to freely power up the Core Generator.  You can instead just build power generators youself.  One Fusion Generator is enough to power up the Core Generator.
---
Fusion Generator plans can be acquired thru the powering up event, but that is a waste of time.  For very cheap you can buy the plans for the Fusion Generator from the vendors.  Less than 400 caps with Hard Bargain 3.
---
I imagine the "concrete" element is sort of meant to be like crushing the grains under stones, though in real life the stones aren't consumed after making one sack of flour.
---
Yup. 
---

I am 199. Was like, um lets take tesla rifle so i can tag and let others have kills. Maaan there is no time to tag, everything dead before spawning.
---
The gilt minigun skin doesn't work anymore ? Well that sucks. At least there's still atom store chrome I guess, and that spawn is a non legendary anyway.
---
Hopefully the gilt one that can drop of SBQ isn't suffering this issue too.. 
---
Good call, forgot all about that
---
61 here and still waiting to find out what I'll be when I grow up.  Was having a beer the other night and got to talking about when the first Pong video game arrived in the bar. Winter of 1976 I think.  In my lifetime we've come from that to F76....
---
In che senso? Per me funziona.
---
If you're wanting the masks and stuff, I'd be happy to get and save whatever I can for whenever you're able to play. I don't really care for the masks, so it's no loss for me. 
---
I want to buy MIRV Launcher Plans
---
...and however much they use, VATS uses far, far more. NOTHING will drain a fusion core like using VATS in power armour.
---
You'll still get event credit and rewards, and honestly the loot from the legendary sloth isn't that impressive at any level.  It's all about the event rewards not the loot from one mob.
---
I’ve been going as Hitler.
---
So say I engage back with someone but I die, what happens to my stuff? He get’s to loot my junk, right? 
---
I just keep on the order of mysteries veil. Or maybe a different mouth covering if I’m done with the order quests. Protects me, and no loss of perception like gas masks so I never have to switch it off. 
---
I doing it for the pvp mode lol
---
I am not noob, i have pacifist. Even tho i could use some caps killing those amateurs :D
---
So many people here bandwagoning "he must be a cheater hurr durr". Do you guys not realize you can in fact gather a lot of resources legitimately when you have mules? That mules were never against the rules? That you could come across a bag and think "oh sweet it's my lucky day"? People do this. Also, no every duper is responsible for server crashes, not every method involved causing you instability.
---
Too many people here acting like it's okay for a AAA publisher to ignore their fan base and that a company providing poor communication should be commended. Have you forgotten the nylon bags? Poor quality promotional rum? The buggy release? Bethesda's own slow reaction time to fixing these issues in the first place? Pricing this game like it's a finished product while having a cash shop priced like this is a free to play game? Selling you stuff that already existed in Fallout 4 rather than just including it? I certainly no longer place Bethesda on a pedestal and neither should you. The ban system is another thing that needs to be fixed.
---
* If people are going to be banned, they should be able to reach out to support and at least get an answer. 
---
* If you're banned (or suspended) and try to login, the error message should reflect that - not some long error message with no meaning.
---
* Suspensions should really give an ETA. It is okay to be permanent, but indefinite suspension is not the same as permanent.
---
* Suspensions/bans should not block the entire Bethesda account, access to a specific game or to multiplayer is more appropriate. Furthermore, suspended/banned player should at least be able to access their support ticket. Some people cannot access their account right now.
---
How does any of the above affect you? It doesn't. If you were falsely banned or believe that being falsely banned is possible, then you should want the above.
---
Yeah, if you’re carrying junk. If you’re out to PvP leave your junk at home. 
---
Side note, I would like a Rick and Morty episode about sentient cranberries. And when you drink Ocean Spray, it knows you're drinking it so you've got to live with that now.
---
That’s always the way it goes but on the bright side it’s still early days and there’s still plenty of time to get one, good luck out there 👍
---
I fast traveled up to the farm where there's always creatures fighting last night, and I also encountered this bug. After tossing a plasma grenade at the group, (2x super mutants, 2x rad scorps, 1x snallygaster and 1x deathclaw) the deathclaw POOFED. I looked all around until I passed by a tree and got slapped. ( I think the death-claw got thrown into the tree and decided to stay still) I turned around and on my hud saw "Level 48 Deathclaw" in red with barely any health left.  I shot at where it should be, nothing. I took out my machete and whopped it. It instantly spawned inside the tree, roared and died, and my sound cut off. I had to restart the game to get it back o.O 
---
Its an old greentext copypasta edited for fo76... 
---
Wooosh
---
Yeah, it seems to do something with AR^((Adrenal Reaction)) and/or Bloodied weapons and negates the effects the Bloodied/AR.(Or dose something that makes DMG drop a lot)
---
That's at least what I noticed, I only have the bear necessity for mutations^((Revolving around Unarmed)) so I'm unaware if it dose something else
---
VATS is your biggest culprit if you use it a lot in PA. I spent ages building a critical VATS character who spent all of their time out of PA. Went into a nukezone in PA Vats away not knowing any better and went through 11 fusion cores in about 20 minutes. 
---
Never again. You can VATS, you can PA, unless you have a ridiculous amount of Cores, you can't effectively do both. Every tap of L1 makes a visible drain on the fusion core, actually using said VATS when it finds someone uses even more.
---
Power User helps, but not by much when it comes to VATS
---
175 caps
---
Kill wendigos and yoa guai
---
Really the only way to get caps fast is to participate, and be good at, PVP.
---
You can try actively trading sought after items for Caps, but that is a time consuming venture.
---
Enemy cap drops are minimal.  You can get a few hundred if you spend a day targeting creatures that drop them, but it's mostly a waste.
---
Prepare your bulk/aid/chems/apparel to sell before logging out for the night during your end of day clean up.  That will make the start of your next day faster.  Sure it's just shifting the "chore", but I know my end of day is usually spent sorting thru my daily haul at my CAMP anyway.  Might as well do it all at once rather than split it up and do half at the start of the day too.
---
Ah sweet
---
I'll endure the exile...
---
They're level 5 enemies. If someone is seriously using the event to farm that sweet 12 points of experience then they are doing it wrong. 
---
I had so much fun last night, just hanging out with other people in between events and shooting the shit for a while. This is the sort of thing I want out of a multiplayer Fallout game.
---
On another note, am I the only one who finds this new event kinda goofy and a little  redundant?   If you want a mission where you protect robots from NPC hostiles, you can go play "Census Violence."
---
Can't take *all* your shit. Only "junk" (getting killed in PVP or PVE in this game comes with very little cost; you always keep all your weapons, armor, food/meds/etc and only lose scrappable stuff).
---
They can't kill you straight away; you only get minor damage unless you fight back, which triggers full PVP. Put yourself on pacifist and this won't happen. Only exceptions are: 1) claiming a workshop, which opens you to PVP everywhere, and 2) if you've got reactive plates on power armor which redirects damage back at them, effectively accepting a PVP challenge.
---
Camp they can't access your stash. They can damage your structures, but those can be easily/cheaply repaired  - the entire camp at literally a single button click. Camps (including glitchy builds like my rooftop garden-in-one-square get faithfully reproduced no matter which server you get sent to. Only problem is if you pick a popular place (like mine, atop a lead deposit near a bunch of fun stuff) you might have to load onto multiple servers.
---
Honestly, depending on your platform you'll likely have nothing to worry about. PC, everyone is cooperative as heck. I've only been attacked once in a workshop, and only had some minor griefing at my camp (12 year old dipshit thinking he was playing fortnite when we were both level 5 put a frag mine on the steps of my base trying to goad me into a battle. I ignored him and he got bored.) I haven't seen anyone over level 10 with locks on their doors or windows even. It's really common to come back and see people using your crafting stations. When they're done they'll wave, maybe drop a gift for you, especially if they see you're lower level.
---
No human NPCs besides Wooby that I'm aware of.
---
thats more like the power armor frame then power armor. 
---
Believe springs can be acquired in large quantities from Camp McFlintlock (easy for low levels).  And Helvetia and Horizon's Rest _used_ to be good for Screws at low levels, but with the event going on there it doesn't respawn the items very much if at all.
---
That's very nice of you, thanks! -))
---
Gee...I now know why I play solo..and crouch a lot!  lol
---
I'm afraid that having risen, the mothman entered restricted airspace and suffered an 'accident' due to it's negligence.

I get what you're saying, but the name is that of a Swiss colony in WV.  They were isolated for generations and that tends to make language drift.  I'm not sure that the German pronunciation is applicable to the way that they say it in that town.  I believe it's pronounced as "Hell-Veesh-ya" by the locals.
---
I grew up in Fayette County in WV.  Most people would tell you that the pronunciation should be "Fay-ette."  But we said it "Fed."  
---
It has the player count of an SBQ event, and frequently the armor and weapons of one too, but the actual danger you face is minimal. Unless you hear that God damned beeping... I don't think I'll ever forget that sound..
---
Overall a fun little convoy/escort event that usually has half the server involved. Hopefully it's back next March aswell. 
---
Only if they have crap armor. A full sentinel or cavalier bloodied build, you’re definitely not one shotting them, unless of course you’re using the same methods that one shot any build, but that’s not relevant here.
---
Well if you are going to give cosmetic items, atleast give a good looking one, not some out of proportions mask that doesn't fit at all with rest of the armor.
---
Very sharp looking. 
---
Is the normal fisherman’s hat rare? Or is it just the old fisherman’s hat that is hard to find? 
---
Agreed, the ultimate goal is to keep them alive
---
Clipboards in office buildings are a good source of springs.  I like fort McClintock.  Screws, my go to is the shop steel heart is in in Morgantown.  3 or 4 boxes there if not already raided
---
I attack everyone at the event as soon as its over.  Usually a few people are down to clown after waiting 20 mins for the dumb robots to walk in a circle. 
---
The game doesnt let you PvP against players doing the same event as you...
---
Be 60 this year, been console gaming since pong came out w/ a 15 ft. cord and 2 player console panel.  Hooked it up to our black and white T.V., sitting on top of the broken color one, and was the coolest kid on the block that summer. Nulla Vetus Schola Schola!
---
You can collect a lot of Springs from scrapping clipboards at Camp McClintock. You can farm screws from the Charleston Herald building by picking up the type writers and desk fan in the building as well.

It’s Her-my-oh-nee, not Her-me-oh-nee.
---
I'm hoping that Appalachia Cooler/Freezer in the Faschnacht Event in Helvetia is a hint toward the future.
---
If implemented, I am imagining it will work similar to the Display system being previewed in the Fermenter.  A limited number of items from your Stash can be "placed" into it.
---
Don't imagine it will make them never spoil though.  Instead likely a significant reduction in spoiling rates.
---
I don’t know why this is being downvoted.  It’s a legit question.
---
I play nearly everyday and genuinely enjoy the game.  You might too.
---
Lmao, so true, seems that most people are compelled to act a fool when trading. 
---
I noticed in one picture you have that machine that ejects fusion cores. Does that create one every time you log on or does it use one?
---
50 yr old. (Could be older lol) played all Fallout’s  (3, new Vegas and 4 are faves) Was playing 4 from when it came out till 76 beta started. 700 hrs in so far in Appalachia. Love this more than I thought. Play w a group of 3 kids lol. In their 20’s who I work with. Not the fastest, and often need help w locations ( get lost a lot lol ).  Have killed so many scorched beasts that have lost count. Rare to be bothered but do the same and change servers. ( and never hurt another on purpose) Have a problem w hoarding legendary items (junkies pool cue anyone) play w my 12 and 20 yr olds but they are not into it as much as I am. Use their alt characters to store my legendaries.  Glad to see others like me out there. Out of work at 2pm then into the wasteland for me. Fun times.  (Ok got no life lol). Ok see u out there all   
---
This is nice. Good to see sales coming in particular, cause buying something a day or two before it drops price is always annoying. xD
---
That said, the WV billboards still seem to use 5% of your camp budget, so I still feel burned by that purchase. I haven't seen any acknowledgement that it's unintended so will probably not buy more atom shop stuff until it's addressed one way or another.   
---
I'm in either way.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Intendi uscire dalla partita o chiudere direttamente l'applicazione?
---
quindi sei al momento out?
---
allora vedo di non loggare sino a quando sistemano..
---
That wasn’t my experience. SBs have a mechanic where they slowly drift closer and closer to the nearest player, whether or not they’ve detected you. That, combined with them summoning scorched whenever they catch a hint of you moving around, made it impossible for me to spend more than 10 minutes at the site without having to kill an SB and his entourage every time I wanted to fast travel.
---
It’s a shame, cause it also has a lead deposit. Perfect ammo producing camp.
---
Hi bud..I've got one! Completed an event and it dropped off a mole miner!
---
Are these stash boxes universal for me? As in, if i store my stuff in a certain box, is it only available in THAT box in that place, or can i acces this stuff while being on the other side of the map and finding another stash box? (like in the witcher 3, i loved that system) That was kinda my beef in Fallout 4, where I always had to return to 1 place for all my stuff. 
---
Vats crits...
---
I have too much karma... let's get rid of some of it!
---
Maybe they could add a fashion show mode and whomever has the most 'Care Bear' outfit can claim the workshop and be invulnerable for the rest of their session. Plus they get a *special* powder blue unicorn helmet that everyone can admire. 
---
On a serious note... survival will DRAW away the PVPers but the griefers are staying. They don't really want to PVP. When everyone is in pacifist mode they'll just server hop until they can take all the workshops and farm plans and mats with impunity. No one will be able to do a single thing about it. 
---
Be very careful what you ask for unless you really do want turret farms behind the golf clubs on every server.
---
Was this really a lmao moment?  I must not laugh very easily.
---
They're supposed to be similar to actual Fasnacht Day masks worn during the REAL Fasnacht Day. They look fine with plenty of outfits, if you ask me and the majority of people wearing them.
---
It makes you immune to "CRIPPLE staggers" Not immune to stagger in general.
---
Thanks.  I missed that detail.  Great to know 
---
You ain't kidding.  It was stressful as hell launching it even on a team, and a complete nightmare doing it alone, though I managed to pull it off lol, 
---
 Few heavy machine gun and missile turrets should cure what ails you.
---
perfect, thank you
---
I feel your pain.
---
A lot of what to keep/what to sell or drop depends on what level you are, where you are venturing, and if you have a particular build.
---
I've recently started doing nuke runs, so have a collection of legegedary items I can't use b/c I'm not quite high enough level yet....but I want to try them/compare to what I am using now before I dump them (at the mercy of RNG, dont want to drop something good I may not see again for a long time.)
---
I keep all screws, gears, springs, hardened masses...and I have a weakness for fusion cores.
---
Steel, ballistic fiber, Wood and adhesive for repairing most everything.
---
Fertilzer breaks down to acid.  Acid and (metal) ore makes (metal scap)
---
If you do nuke zones - unused raw flux turns to inert flux, which provides 25% water.  For my perk build, inert flux is lighter than purified water (but inert flux has no health bonus, adn I think 1 rad)
---
If you dont have excavator armor yet, you'll need steel, a small quantity of crystal, as well as something like 36 black titanium, and a bunch of screws.  Dont remember what else you need.
---
If you have PA parts you don't have the level to use, store the parts in a frame, not loose in your stash.   Frame weighs 10, the inidividual parts are what 12-20 each? 
---
Frame plus stored parts only weighs 10.
---
You will not be able to "collect" the frame with higher level parts, but but if you wait out the timer, it will auto recall to your inventory.  At that point, you can transfer the frame back to stash, with an instant weight savings of whatever the parts alone weighed.
---
I have very small quantities of coal, fiberglass, bone, circuits, cork, glass, ceramic. (haven't found much use for these yet.)
---
dump/give away/trade ammo or weapons you dont use or have, or are not effective.  For example, the .308 cal light machine gun sounds amazing, but my 308 marksman sniper rilfe does more damage faster, with significantly less ammo.  (LMG 11per shot vs MSR 90 per shot)
---
I've picked up sooo much ammo as i go, I rarely need to make it.
---
also give us a composer, throw food stuffs we do not need in there to speed up the spoiling process.
---
Fallout is about shades of grey, no clear cut good or bad.  So really if you want to play Fallout, you're going to deal with people that just don't like you and want you dead.  It's all about survival.
---
Trying to switch the language of your console in English (American or UK). It seems to be a possible solution (I haven’t tested it yet)
---
Oh man.  If there are glitches/bugs with the vending machines, I can just see it now.  People are going to say that griefers set up a trap vending machine that doesn't dispense what it's supposed to.  Hackers!
---
I like when the music starts to cut out like the robot playing the song has a low battery. Makes it extra sh*tty, lmfao.
---
&gt;speed up the spoiling process
---
Ever since the Patch 7 update, you don't have to worry about making food stuffs spoil faster.  :)
---
Does bulking decrease weight?
---
which weapon doesnt one shot the level 5 mobs at the parade? and who cares anyway. everyone is there for the mask, i dont even fire at the mobs they die isntantly anyway from the whole server being there.
---
Good times
---
It's a lot less buggy and more stable than it was at launch, though it still has problems. Still very fun and addictive.
---
Snarky/helpful advice:
---
Back when the game was new, this wouldn't be great advice, but now that there's high level players running around everywhere : Stay the hell away from whitesprings for as long as you can! 
---
If there, you are likely to be: nuked / savaged by level 68 ghouls / savaged by level 68 ghouls and then nuked / savaged by level 68 nuked ghouls. Just sayin' 
---
what an original idea, totally hasn't been posted a thousand times since the game came out...
---
Gamma gun has a better chance, radium has such little radiation that even a small amount of radiation resistance will negate most of it.
---
Thing is you’re gonna have to hit the guy 2-3 times with the gamma gun, yet he’ll probably only need to hit you once.
---
Also, any good bloodied build runs radaway on their hotkeys, so it’s likely neither of these will work.
---
I love the half wall break   It will work great in my loft space if u ever rebuild it.  
---
Everybody playing fair is like the top#1 anti-Fallout idea. When the duping was common, I absolutely loved the feeling of walking on the gray zone between legit and cheating - or in other words, with each item purchased, calculating the chances of item being a dupe and risk of loosing items that somebody duped. World where everybody would play fair would be so extremely disconnected from the lore and the vibe of the fallout universe. No, thank you, I'd rather have a healthy dose of bad stuff happening in this game. There is no light where there is no darkness. No point in being good when there's no bad people. Synths, unite.
---
Thanks, now I'll bookmark this post and keep checking to see if we have confirmed any others lol.  I've almost gotten every "confirmed" item already (missing donut and sausage recipe) so I'm eager to know if there are more.
---
Turning 72 in a couple of months and have been a gamer since the original Doom came out and we figured out we could network together on a local network. I love the camp building aspect of the game, especially since we got the increased budget. Have played and mastered all of the fallout games and 76 is turning out to be one of the best. I do a lot of walking around instead of “fast traveling” just so I can take in the actual beauty of the atmosphere of the game. The detail is exceptional. Currently working on level 92 and team up with 2 other older players. I also constantly get the comment “you are to old to be playing games” from my wife who can barely use an IPad. I will be to old when they put me in the ground. I find this as a stress reliever but do try to limit my playing to 2-3 hours per night. Looking forward to the next upgrade addition to the game.
---
I really like this flavour of Fallout. I like the map, the locations, the odd little scenes you happen across. I think it's pretty bleak and post-apocalyptic and it *feels* fallout-ish, if that makes sense?  
---
People can and sometimes will attack you. You can fight or you can run, but if they have a decent PvP build they'll probably kill you if you fight. When you die, you drop junk that you're carrying but your weapons and armour are safe. I run from almost all PvP encounters because I'm just not interested in them. On the one occasion a particularly determined player came after me and kept chasing me, I just logged off and back on again.  
---
Players can and sometimes will attack your camp. They can reduce it to a smoking ruin, but they can't steal items from your 'Stash'. You can rebuild your camp with one click of a button using the 'Repair All Structures' option from your deployable C.A.M.P. if you have the required resources.  
---
Your camp loads into every server you go into as long as someone isn't already in that spot on that server. You get the option to try another server until your camp can be placed.  
---
There are one or two living NPCs I suppose but most are robots. They are far and away much less interesting than the sometimes aggressive, often wonderful, always quirky beings you encounter called 'Players'  
---
I think 76 is being given away in breakfast cereal boxes now. Give it a go! What do you have to lose? :)
---
Ive done it 5 times and never any pvp. what platform are you playing on
---
Was hoping there was something I'm missing. It's gotten to the point that I just don't care to do the vendor runs anymore. I'll hit them up if I'm near, but forget wasting an hour of the limited time I have on it.
---
I don't have a problem with PvP, and have made quite a bit defending workshops. Just not that interested in ganking, or actively pursuing it.
---
Guess I'll keep being poor(ish).
---
Well, when I go to see the parade in Times New Roman next time, I'll be sure to pronounce it correctly.
---
i wanna cram them in there, craft some bullets and take them out to make fertilizer for some grenades.
---
I believe you’re referring to the fusion generator. It’s just a generator that supplies 100 power. It doesn’t create fusion cores, sadly :) 
---
I feel like it was yesterday just because it was yesterday 
---
I wish there was a take all button so I could then make sure everything is crunched down and then bulked and then choose what goes in, and then shit on the floor everything I don't want.
---
It’s happened to me a few times since the last patch
---
#BAIT AND SWITCH
---
Hurry up and downvote! Lol
---
Workshops are actually terrible in comparison to farming your own resources.  I run a junk generator on my property and have zero need for them.  They are just not worth my time or the pvp engagement. 
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek

Happy to help! I cant wait for that update but until then my fat man and I will continue to destroy people like that!

From my limited knowledge that map is fairly accurate for the FO universe.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the help. Good luck at finding the recipes!
---
Right. Its before and after. Nothing wrong with clowing around but the contant punching of everyone for 10min straight is annoying. 
---
I have done it, in less than 10 minutes. And I have participated in 50-100 queen events with my bloodied build since I’ve been running bloodied since before the tse nerf. If you run the right defensive cards, you can be very tanky.
---
Hell im usually the one taking every smack from the queen, tanking her and doing the most damage smacking her for minimum 2k a hit, it’s all in the right perks my friend.
---
I mean no problemo with no looto, but it is boring waiting for mobs to die when spawned.
---
Lets nuke it first!
---
I got a spare owl I can give you. 
---
[Owl mask looks pretty cool with my nuka quantum paint job](https://imgur.com/kqsaQL1)
---
Same here, the owl one is the only mask I want. Hopefully I’ll have time to run a bunch more and will actually drop for me. 
---
XP and caps are two things in the game you need 'just right' amount and that you don't really need in abundance. If you are in terrible need of xp, and its past your third day of gameplay, you are doing it wrong.
---
You can always put the 2 helmets/masks on the quick selection wheel and change easily whenever you need to. 
---
They removed flare gun as legendary loot. just need to keep reminding them to remove drill and syringer as legendary loot. They said they would look into it but still nothing.
---
I've had similar incidents 
---
Bit obvious isnt it? Sounds a bit dull
---
IF we had weapon racks to display in our camps all the pew-pews that we collected that didn't count towards stash space I wouldn't mind getting a bad legendary.
---
&gt; If i understand the perk system correctly, i can respec eventually, right? 
---
Yes, but it's far better to get your build right the first time without going to level 200 or w/e, and you're going to want a lot of crafting perks most likely, so keep that in mind.
---
&gt; If so, might want to move Int points out after i'm finished crafting guns and relocate those points to max out Ironclad/Action Boy or is Demo. Expert worth keeping? 
---
You should be fine with 5 int. That should allow you to craft whatever you want, you'll just need to swap perk cards a lot while crafting. When crafting weapons / armor, you'll want to use an unyielding set + some +int food and chems to max your durability bonus out (requires 20 int).
---
Demo expert isn't really worth it at all anymore sadly. Gunsmith is a good perk though - reapairing your weapon is a pain in the butt.
---
&gt; Is this setup good enough for endgame PvE? 
---
No, not really. You're going to have severe lack of damage output against Scorchbeast Queen, high level creatures like glowing gulpers / mirelurk queens, maybe even against normal end game enemies like super mutants.
---
&gt; How about blowing away the random Wanted player or it that reserved for dedicated cheese only? 
---
I wouldn't bother engaging in pvp with this build. You will die. The best builds will easily one shot you unless you run full assn / sentinel, and those people are all but immortal unless you get a stagger. Even if you do manage to get a stagger before they one shot you (unlikely), the assassin's stuff will keep them alive long enough to use a stim / stagger animation to end, and then you're dead. PvP in this game is so unbalanced right now that it really isn't worth participating in.
---
&gt; Do i need Chameleon or not (i really don't like it :/)?
---
Equipping one piece of Chameleon armor is definitely worth it if you plan on doing any sniping. There isn't a downside really.
---
**More Info**
---
Without any weight reduction perks and no strength, you're going to have a very hard time carrying anything at all. You could run full unyielding, but then you'd have no health, and you're not doing a bloodied build or melee so that would seem pointless.
---
There's no point in carrying a shotgun or pistol unless you're going to get the damage boosting perks for them, and you really can't with this build. FO76 doesn't allow that level of versatility sadly. The best you might be able to pull off is a hybrid rifle + melee build, or a heavy weapons build where you can swap in melee cards.
---
Much of  your damage relies on sneak attacks, which is fine, but you'll have a difficult time staying stealthed during SBQ. You might be fine for crawling through dungeons or even nuked whitesprings in stealth, but you won't be able to contribute much on SBQ.
---
Something you should keep in mind - aside from the direct weapon damage modifiers like Rifleman, most damage multiplication perks, legendary effects, etc., are multiplicative. To reach high damage, you need to multiply your damage many times over with these effects. 
---
MOST of the damage on high dps end game builds comes from running many multipliers that are only accessible at below 20% HP. Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, and a Bloodied weapon are all separate multipliers and that's how people get to really absurd numbers.
---
**To Summarize:**
---
* Lack of carry weight reduction = difficult time.
---
* Damage output severely reduced if not in stealth
---
* Not a low health build means you're missing some of the most important damage modifiers.
---
* Would require an instigating weapon to be effective at killing in pve, but dps would be abysmal for anything that doesn't die in one hit.
---
* Too much weapon diversity, not enough specialization, carrying all those weapons will eat up most of your minimal carry weight. Pick one.
---
Like I said, it's great but they need to calm down with acting like they are gods.
---
Xbox,
---
Did the event this morning before leaving for work, and there were at least 12 players, I wasn't sure what all of them were called, but I counted 9 different masks on players, and I think the only one I haven't seen is the Skull mask.
---
Yup. Any stash box in the world is unique to you, except for the Overseers's stash boxes. It's exactly like the Witcher 3's stashes.
---
Desk fans and some toys are other good sources for screws and gears.
---
Several critters are now dropping screws, too.  
---
(Picked 10 or so off glowing bloated ones last night.)
---
Clipboards and kitchen scales for springs.
---
Couple of places seem to spawn screw boxes - usually near a workbench. 
---
 Some vendors carry them, but they are not necessarily cheap.
---
Tagging the items for search will help you find more.
---
What about them?
---
No? Ever heard of "Mothership Zeta"? It is in the fallout lore. Fallout isn't about a plague either but look at the main enemy for fo76... scorched. 
---
I completely agree. Hopefully when pvp servers come, they will migrate there and become farmed themselves. 
---
Yeah it was dull until I earned the Enclave Officer uniform.
---
The two you have are the exact 2 I have. For my third, I went for a strictly survival mode/pvp character
---
Nah 
---
XB1. I did the event 3 times yesterday with my daughter who is a level 20. All three times she was attacked and killed at the end. I was attacked too but being level 167 it turned out differently.
---
On PC: I actually had this happen while trying to take a picture of me and some guys playing instruments over at Biv's. Not sure how I fixed it, I think I went into 3rd person mode, but I got it to work eventually.
---
On a side note: Fun thing to do with the camera... pretend to be a spy or out on a recon mission, even be a voyeur if you want! 
---
Every once and a while I test my stealth skills by seeing how long I can track a player while taking candid pictures of them doing stuff like building or farming. Creepy I know, but it is very rare I'm actually found (or they are just ignoring me while I'm creeping around taking pics of them). Tip: If you think someone is following you pop some berry mentats and if they get close enough you should see their purplish glow.  
---
I started doing this while playing mysterious stranger for lower level players... watching them until they got into trouble and then sniping the enemy before they died. Then I started taking pics of them fighting, then it blossomed into me playing a creepy spy. 
---
Maybe one day I'll upload an album or something... 
---
TL;DR: PvP isn't a big deal in this game unless you want it to be,  have fun! HAVE FUN. 
---
I do PvP extensively in this game. 
---
Usually,  my group won't engage lower levels at all unless we're trying to server wipe (make everyone besides us leave the server). 
---
It's just not profitable or sporting. 
---
There are groups that will specifically target new players, but the game mechanics are such that you have to fight back or be involved in workshop PvP for anyone to do full damage to you. 
---
The consequences of dying have been explained to you, and usually won't affect you much, especially if you keep your "junk" stored.
---
PvP can be fun and rewarding once you get the hang of it.  It's a learning curve for sure,  and very gear-dependant (there are some very specific PvP weapon and armor setups).
---
Until you learn the game and beat the story,  I wouldn't worry  too much about PvP, unless you planned on becoming a human-hunter yourself, in which case,do what I did.  Get in at least one PvP fight every day, start it, respond to getting attacked,  it doesn't matter.  Learn by experience and by talking to others. 
---
Above all,  have fun.  Too many people get so worked up about PvP in this game that it surely detracts from their enjoyment.  The amount of hateful messages I've recieved from players on the recieving  end of my video game violence builds daily, and for what? I'm not hurting anyone in real life, I'm not cheating at the game (I die plenty, trust me), and I'm not getting on the mic to harass people.  Just trying to kill their video game character with my own video game character. 
---
 Simple as that,  have fun. 
---
Same. I have my camp in a cave with lead and acid and right next to a spot with guaranteed super mutants spawning. I've switched over to a melee build, but before that I never ran out of ammo. 
---
Agree, or at least slap damage cap at certain % of the health
---
Interesting. The sausage filled me up quite a bit so I’ll stop tossing that. Just got the recipe last night but hadn’t investigated the requirements yet. 
---
Heh, every time I do it now it feels like a cake walk in comparison.
---
First time I ran it, went in with three other peeps, got all our gear wrecked, nuked morgantown and then got the rest of our gear wrecked so hard i was beting on glowing ones with a level 5 fire axe by the end &gt;&lt;
---
Though yeah, our gear wasn't great back then, and the damage bug was in full force. 
---
[https://imgur.com/Gra4Ia3](https://imgur.com/Gra4Ia3) Just before first silo run. Note the raider PA parts ..those were level 15. 
---
It's just trolls 
---
I've posted about this before, it would give a MASSIVE boost to the end game. If you could keep developing workshops over multiple game sessions, it opens up a lot of play opportunities:   
---
1. We'd have an additional goal in the end game, and would have stuff to build (and places to put Atom Shop toys) after our CAMP budget is completely fleshed out. 
---
2. Workshops would be a lot more interesting and custom when you run into them. There'd be a greater sense of wonder and discovery when you stumble upon them. 
---
3. When you add in player vending machines, they would become gathering points on the map. 
---
4. Obviously workshops would become a lot more fortified over time, so you could put in a countervailing siege warfare system. When someone challenges you, maybe it creates a separate build area outside of the main workshop zone where you could place artillery and other implements to take out your enemies fortifications. 
---
5. Creates a giant resource sink, as you're now building more stuff more regularly - and you'd actually invest your own resources into WorkShops. Also, defending and repairing them would eat resources, which in turn would create greater demand for them. This creates the foundation of an economy. 
---
6. You could implement quests at particular workshops that would allow you to upgrade their output. Again, with the increased resource sink - this wouldn't be game breaking. 
---
I could go on. 
---
I just imagine someone waking up in Helvetia after a hard night on the chems and Nukashine, hearing the music, seeing the masks, power armour and mobs and then slowly pouring out the contents of their booze bottle, olde-timey comedy style :D
---
Try hacking it.
---
It's annoying 
---
Anywhere there is a STASH box will show only your stuff, to only you. This could be at your camp, others camps, red rocket gas stations, basically anywhere on the map there is a STASH box.
---
What good is a mask or some dangly ribbons for your camp? Doesn't help you in the game at all. But I guess it gives ya something to do. To each their own I guess. As for needing xp, it's better getting xp than a dumb giant mask. That's all I'm saying. 
---
Maybe you get the first five for the first half of the event timeline and the second five on the second half of the event timeline? Just a theory and maybe a good troll on Bethesda's part.
---
Expensive is relative though. If you have thousands saved up and don't buy much normally, it won't even impact you in a negative way which makes your enjoyment worth it. I will agree though that some things could be cheaper, but perhaps the new power armor skin being much cheaper than the others could signal a turn in the right direction. I don't see them making limited things like this much cheaper though.
---
Well they are meant to store nuclear waste in.
---
I've had 4 owl masks so far... Rip me. 
---
The cockiness of these kids knows no bounds. 
---
I make sure i hit everyone at least once with my buzzblade. Im also mic active so ill ask if anyone wants to fight...
---
Once again, the game doesnt allow for PvP between 2 players doing the same event. So SLAP damage doesnt even register, so you arent losing health... 
---
I dont see why it bothers you so much tbh.  Just jump around.
---
Have you tried.. *talking* to them? Its much better than leaving passive agressive posts on reddit. 
---
Ho provato a uscire e rientrare e non ho riscontrato nessun problema.
---
Its blury or im blind but is there a nuke being dropped south of Virginia?
---
Lol. I have a 3 star bloodied death tambo.
---
Mothership Zeta is about as far as Bethesda should ever go when it comes to aliens. Aliens should be a cool little secret in the games, not massive plot points. Also, a plagues aren’t new to Fallout; the unreleased Fallout 3 by interplay featured a plague as a main plot point and the Pitt has a wide-scale disease plaguing the workers at the steel mill.
---
Yup, I have lead and junk.  I'm always looking to optimize resource gathering in survival games.  Workshops are a terrible way to do it.  My advice, don't use them ever.
---
I’m a dog food man myself.  One of these days I’ll switch to a different food but only when they fix these patch 7 spoil rates.  
---
i'd say go for heavy guns they are fun, but your str build is essentially also a heavy build with 12 levels or so needed for the perks cards.
---
It's a bunch of little trolls 
---
I think that someone from Bethesda said that they acknowledged the question about this, and that they might be able to do something.
---
I think this is the best idea. We know they can do this because the artillery and the fermenting station use stash storage. 
---
Its trolling kids with no real world worth.
---
Coming to you after this event
---
Wow, that actually looks really amazing!! Gave me a chuckle too. 
---
I'm gonna do something I rarely do because there are already plenty of people there so it's hard to get a server slot where I can place my camp, but here you go.
---
Put your C.A.M.P. [here](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2203). Lead deposit with a big lead seam on the hill above. Straight north is a rest stop where packs of baddies regularly attack tamable creatures. Straight south is Huntersville, which has about 8-10 supermutants; depending on your level they'll be carrying hunting rifles (.308), pipe weapons (so .38 rounds), assault rifles (5.56) or miniguns. Wipe them out for caps and gunpowder and scrap their weapons for steel. There are also tons of meatbags around with ammo and animal parts, some of which (like bloodbug stuff) scraps to acid, which you can use with cloth to make gunpowder, and a variety of meat to cook. That plus the lead at your camp will keep you in bullets. 
---
I've recently switched to a gauss rifle, which is even better, because those rounds are only lead and steel, no gunpowder.
---
I need to look into this 
---
This is flippin' great!
---
I've been resorting to Fallout Search, but I've found that the individual who runs that is getting far too personal with that profile and frequently brings in biases against Fallout/Bethesda into their mix of also promoting their material. 
---
Ahhhhhh Shia and Turtle return!
---
Hold up
---
Weeping sores filled Gramps...
---
okay how about my user name
---
Mutant Dogmeat. Much better... can I go with that one?
---
Have you tried blueprints (no foundation)?
---
South Virginia wasn’t targeted by nuclear bombs. The damage you see when you come out of the vault were all caused by natural disasters and the fallout from neighbouring states following the war. Each zone has its own backstory explaining what went wrong. 
---
The Ash Heap for example was destroyed by imploding mine shafts and a firestorm that lasted for years. The Toxic valley was contaminated when a chemical plant was damaged and leaked its contents into the valley. 
---
The man in the cabin must have seen DC going up in smokes, or one of the other neighbouring cities. 
---
Hmm. 
---
So, heavy hits still stagger? Should be golden. Gauss and The Dragon seem to have a pretty high impact, and with the perk that makes % of rifle hits stagger, vats head-shots in quick succession with a barrel mag handmade should do the trick. 
---
Either way, those fights are generally over pretty quick one way or another. If they don’t know I’m there they won’t be standing still so they’re done. If they know I’m there and not where I am - Dragon, quick switch to gauss within stagger and that’s usually enough. 
---
If that doesn’t do it, 90% of the time I’ll just sneak away. I’ve also found the ability to choose engagements is a massive sniper advantage. Especially bounty hunting. 
---
He didnt ask users to go after a player or accuse anyone of anything. This is a false accusation.
---
Everyone who was un-suspended is now suspended again after the latest content activation yesterday. No information besides that.
---
Ok I'm in my camp in watoga
---
That would be super awesome :) thank you!
---
They have no value in the real world and need to feel big and bad in the game. 
---
Afaik no one has, at least said online, that they have the key to 1 yet. 2 has the alien blaster in iirc, so..maybe there's a live zetan in 1 ? Go go gadget conspiricy theories! 
---
I built a shop for plans as well! [Here’s a video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/-R8RE1_b0Mg) to check it out. I just give them away and posted what I’m doing in neon letters since I don’t use a mic. It’s worked pretty well. When I changed it to “All Plans 50 Caps”, people just walked in and walked right out, no purchases yesterday LoL. So keep that in mind, you may wanna advertise a very low price to get folks interested. 
---
You can learn the plans to craft for your CAMP
---
They bypass sentinals/Cavs effects. So you can kill a player who initiated SLAP real quick.  Bank a crit on some nearby enemy... Return the SLAP, one shot them.
---
I know you! I get serums from you. Youre on my friends list.
---
From a min max perspective I agree. Still, I really miss the feel of the settlement system from FO4 and workshops were as close as I could get.
---
Good sir/madam, I do declare, you seem to be in a mood most foul.  Excusing my hubris at daring to make a suggestion, but I put forth that some time spent exploring the glories of nature might be good for your constitution.  Good day!
---
Lol I like finding these guys. They’re looking to pick on people unprepared for pvp that get annoyed with their pestering and hit back.  I always keep my executioners gamma gun, and pile of stealthboys on deck. If that doesn’t work I just swipe back with my own gauntlet while stealthed. 😎 I’ve beaten whole teams of these griefers this way by myself.
---
It’s definitely been that way since launch. I’m fairly certain thrre’s no way to open it, but given that each door seemingly requires a key rather than just being ‘inaccessible’, I’d wager we’ll gradually get more puzzles a la the Nuka T-51 and Quantum X-01 until we can enter all the domes.
---
It does seem blurry now that I'm viewing it on my phone. On my PC it was fine. Kind of looks like Georgia possibly? Perhaps Atlanta. Or at the very least that would make the most sense, being a very highly populated southern city. Maybe the most highly populated?
---
It seems it’s happening to everyone who was originally banned. I think the unban was an error and they fixed that error.
---
*not making any judgments or statements to your guilt or innocence. 
---
Is it in a nuke-able zone? Maybe that'd spawn more?
---
Glory to mothman
---
Nah there are stagger inducing perk cards, Rifles shotguns and heavy guns 
---
...to be fair, i'd love a TSE flare gun. Firework powers activate! 
---
I want a tse flare gun now.
---
New character or just getting a high level higher?
---
I've been thinking of starting a new character or two in order to try new builds without messing up my main. 
---
I’ve done a handful and never seen less than 10 helping. 
---
I don't think it would be a typo, we've just had the brewing quests released last week,  you have Shear terror coming out on the 9th of April and Ever upwards coming out on the 7th of May, both of them are going to be big updates with quests and new content. I would say the time line looks pretty sound. Each of them are about a month apart for the new quests. 
---
One thing it doesn't include is the underground locations that's shown in the trailer, however I expect they're going to be part of the two main quests mentioned above for Wild Appalachia. 
---
No one is "crying about PvP". Just annoyed at little kids thinking that their extremely common build is special and trying to start fights with people who aren't interested. Just doing slap damage for 10min straight will we are doing events.
---
I wish they were more valuable and became a sort of contested spot.  
---
At least we'll be able to flog them to the legendary vendor soon ? 
---
yesterday I played with a 74-yo, it was really fun 
---
Have you heard about Runescape? In the period in which I have been playing it, 1kk gold costed around 5$ on black market. There was a similar type of collectible hat (party hat) given for some periodic event. By the time I left the game, price of one of phats was like 150kk, or in other words 750$. Was that reasonable? Nah. But it happened anyway. Don't neglect dumb masks.
---
I never knew that! I will be investigating this further now, for the times when there is the obvious idiot baiter duo's. Am i?!
---
I do not recall your name?
---
There's sometimes one on the desk in the control tower at Wade Airport.
---
How do I get the masks?
---
I’m seeing a lot of posts and looking at Bethesda support via twitter that there are many describing the same issue. 
---
I think it was a mistake on their part with the update and no one was Unsuspended... the patch temporarily did this and they found it out. 
---
Or 
---
There is a trigger in the new events but not sure if those players were suspended prior. 
---
Or they’re just messing with them and punishing them further. 
---
it does impact normal explosive weapons (grenade launcher, missile, fatman) as far as i have seen from my time using it
---
PvP can only be initiated once both players attack each other. If you die, either in PvP or PvE, you will ONLY lose your junk items (ie duct tape, etc).
---
Your camp is like a settlement. ONLY you and people in your group can move stuff. There are containers, which act as a universal stash. By universal, I mean that only you can access your own stored items, and that if you put something in a filing cabinet or other container in your camp, you can access those items from your stash box and vice versa.
---
If someone has built their camp on where your location is, your camp will be "stored" and you can move it for free.
---
It's kind of fun. I'm lvl 206 and I think it's a refreshing bit of content. 
---
Taking workshops is almost never worth the cost.  Most servers I join now seem to have at most 2 to 3 claimed areas and quite a few times will have no claimed areas.  I've also noticed that when people do challenge, their characters have only a small amount of caps.
---
Best source of quick screws I've found is Wavy Willard's up in the Northwest, Toy Cars &amp; Trucks galore.
---
I have experienced this same thing with 3 people runing bloodied on PC. Annoying.....
---
Middle room with skeleton at ranger spot in bog 
---
Might be goofy, but its also a nice change of pace from WS nuke zone, with "fun' (IMHO) drops.  A few easy XP, and the legendary is a nice bonus for those that arent quite level or equipment ready for nuke zones.
---
Personally, I've been running a faschnacht man mask / clown outfit combo for over a month, and wanted to see what other creepy combinations I can add.
---
No one knows. It’s all speculation as Bethesda doesn’t release those numbers. 
---
cool, the Inviso-Bill mask
---
I NEED THIS!
---
Deathclaw power armor !!   It’s power armor built into a death claws body!! 
---
this is only my second bethesda game, first being fallout 4. i have been playing the game since beta through all the disconnects and other issues, followed the forums seen all the hate and vitriol and still play.   
---
the thing i always thought when i played fallout 4 was "i wish i could play the game with my friends" 76 gave me that but sadly they saw the hate and didnt even bother trying it.  
---
my main is lvl 225 currently a vats sniper, my second just hit 85 last night melee, third is 16 going pistol build with it. i have roughly at last look 855 hours in game. to me its fallout 4 with friends, i get to run around do whatever then catch up with friends go clear a couple places out, maybe run a silo and nuke zone, hang out at their camp as they redesign it and offer opinions / watch em build or they come to mine to hang out while i remodel.   
---
the game is what you make of it, yeah i still blue screen maybe once or twice a week (ps4), yeah i hit the glitch or hiccup from time to time, stretched bodies i cant loot (maybe once a week). last night for instance i was in a whitesprings nuke zone at the apartments and a ghoul was under the deck of a building so i tried to vats hit it, well it jumped me under the deck under the house with it and i was stuck. I had to fast travel to the station and run back. got a decent laugh out of my friends.
---
regardless of what others say, or reviewers, youtubers and such, only one that can determine how good a game is, is you. most new games sell for 60$, give you 20-30 hours play time to get through the story line then your done.. which roughly means ya paying 2$ or so an hour to play/hopefully enjoy a game.  
---
pretty sure ive gotten my monies worth since im averaging 0.09 cents an hour for time ive played in the game.
---
ive also made a ton of new friends in this game, people i run into in game and people ive met through this reddit and the r/fo76FilthyCasuals so my opinion is give the game a try, get to atleast level 50 or better yet 100 then decide if it was worth it to you or not.   
---
anyways, hope to see ya around the wasteland.
---
Servers are always close to full. Gotta mean the game is not "dead" as the trolls on Twitter and the New Vegas circlejerkers on r/Fallout claim.
---
Na that’s the letterman not the jumpsuit
---
I would have liked to have at least been able to get a hit in on the mega sloth before he was killed, his body didnt even register for me :(
---
Now until March 26th, Event: Fasnacht Day is taking place once per hour 24/7, at the town of Helvetia. When the event completes you have a chance to earn various masks as rewards. Also a variety of new plans and recipes. 
---
Sausages, but I want that damn tartan beret! 
---
What squeaky said. . . But also just so you know. Upon death your junk will be left behind, in a brown paper bag. Some PvP'ers will take it, some will leave it. Long and short, upon death you don't 100% necessarily lose your junk that was on your person. At least not until that bag is gone. There will be a skull and crossbones marker on the compass to help direct you back to the exact location where the bag should be. It does not indicate however if it is still there or not.
---
underground is part of ever upwards I believe
---
"Journey to the **DEEPEST** part of the wilderness"
---
I got the plan out of grafton mayor overseer chest 
---
Great use of the angles as well as the mix of walls. 
---
Yeah I was one pretty late with only a few people on thew server (that I could tell anyway). The event didn't even pop up on the map or events. Still, I really want to see a whole server at once lol
---
This is so frustrating, i was really enjoying being able to play again. I just want to be able to have an open channel of communication, but no way of that.
---
I see your mask, and raise you my fabulous Haunter impression : 
---
[https://imgur.com/cJW37fo](https://imgur.com/cJW37fo)
---
Not anymore. 
---
Its the start of it.
---
There's no place to check actual playerbase. Bethesda will tell you millions, YouTubers will tell you it has an always dwindling playerbase. The Onion will tell you it's just one guy
---
I didnt think they were nuked unless!
---
 (Skip to last paragraph to avoid conspiracy theory)
---
We are all still in the vauly hooked up to the matrix and the final dlc will have us being rescued from the vault into the real game which is heavly nuked and this whole time we were in a simulation preparing for the opening.
---
(Conspiracy theory over)
---
Just found it last night that he explained in detail the nuke cloud and how it look. But as I dont know Fallout geography maybe a nuke did hit roughly 300 miles south of that point
---
Love the roof line and patio, awesome build.
---
LOL. I live in Council Bluffs IA. Small world.
---
Im not gonna link my ign to my reddit accnt sry. Ive got a bad reputation around here lol.
---
Nah, don't get baited, this is the kind of reply idiots make who know that something is broken. See: "It's my money, I do on game what I want" "Who are you to tell people that x is bad?" etc.
---
You can collect them before hand
---
you already get a post removed by moderator. Continue and you'll win a ban (finally)
---
&gt; one step closer to Special Butterfly mode.
---
Which strangely a vocal minority seem to demand
---
It’s hearsay but I finished a parade yesterday and some guy was hyped he got the Sun mask so...take that for what it’s worth.
---
Too much work for me. Just not my thing but I can see how others like it. Just not my thing to collect outfits or build elaborate camps. I should have reworded the "dumb mask" statement because to others it may be awesome. I retrack that statement lol. 
---
Yup, this is for PC users who do not allow to enter a login\\pass and crashes in mein menu when press any button
---
He is new but I know a quick way to level up, I just need people who can kill things cause I can’t. 
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking, I think the Shear terror will be all above ground with maybe a few new buildings to explore similar to the brewing update.
---
Can't wait for all these updates, loving the game so far! 
---
Communication is non existent from what I see. Once they ban or “temporarily suspend” your account you go to the bottom of the support desk tickets. 
---
Via Bethesda support on Twitter you see this in their replies to players. Telling them to submit a ticket and wait or having them reinstall or clear cache knowing it won’t fix anything. 
---
I have been thinking this too. Would actually make it fun and worthwhile to hold workshops.
---
I have blueprinted a standard workshop tower-like setup so it can be dropped down easily, but every time I use it it takes so many materials. Especially if you use turrets.
---
gotta have the trap door drop into a lake!
---
sembra abbiano fixato
---
Xbox here.  Community is trash.  I only take workshops on dead servers now.
---
I was under the impression survival mode will require a new character, am I mistaken?
---
War... has changed.
---
The 3rd time I did the event yesterday the sloth didn’t even spawn
---
I’ve gotten both.  I need that legendary ceramic cup. 
---
I do say, I have not had a post removed, nor do I feel I am violating any rules, as per Rule 4.
---
Thumbs up cool dude!
---
THEY ADD ARMOR!? 😍
---
Idk if The Onion would be that brazen.  They would say at least 1.5 guys.
---
100% not legit
---
I haven't tried, but I wouldn't be surprised if the enemies there could be 1- shot killed  while unarmed lol. 
---
Dam looks pretty cool stalke other players wearing that
---
My rifle build has enough int to craft anything.
---
They’re lvl 120+
---
I’m kind of thinking an explosives build. But idk.
---
Wow....
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll wait to confirm it until someone says they have one or has seen one. Better safe than sorry. 
---
Owl mask for sure! I’m wearing it in place of a helmet on my mothman x-01 so I can cosplay Mothman for the parade :)
---
I would prefer to bring my current character over to it.  I do not have time to grind out another character.  Most people do not.  
---
My favorite thing has been that you get lots of plans from this event. I build new camps frequently and getting the streamers, flags, balloons, etc have really helped me jazz up my shop design. It looks like a crazy thrift store now. I’ll have to post some pics later. 
---
Is this real?
---
Have my respect for retracking your unkind statement, this is more mature than the whole polictical scene in my country combined.
---
Sentient cranberries?
---
I'm not on my ps now, but some friends of mine are saying that the problem seems fixed now. Can someone confirm?
---
I got a tag on the sloth, and wound up with the spinny arrows of fail.  At least I got some XP?
---
The 'toothy man' mask is actually called Second Man. That 'giant' mask is the Merman mask.
---
Sorry, misread. Migraine makin' me dumb. haha
---
They are still a month or so away from launch, so definitely not legit....but,  I have seen quite a few posts where people say random unreleased items and paints appeared for them, which it totally possible.
---
Lol, legitimate...
---
I only do whatever challenges happen to get done while doing what I want.  Achievements and challenges in general are a chore to me.   I've never 100% a games steam achievements, but I've 80-90% a lot by just playing lol

 in [Bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net/) Launcher folder you need find games folder, F76 folder is there

Other skins worked on 4 sets of armor, thoygh. T-45, T-51, T-60, and X-01. The new paint only works on Excavator.

hell-Vee-shuh is more in line with local dialect and no one has "germanic" accents anymore.

WHERE IN GODS NAME IN FAYETTEVILLE HAS IT BEEN SHORTENED TO "FED" Normally everyone around can get out a "Fayut"
---
It's 100% not Oak hill or Fayetteville proper. Ansted? Across the bridge is a whole other world beyond the Oak Hill longtimers and the Fayetteville hippies.
---
he said he got it from a friend. he assumed it's from the dev room, but wasn't sure. that's all i talked with him till he logged off. we had a usual trade since i was looking for the beret and he had it. 
---
What people keep calling 'toothy man' and 'giant' are actually called Second Man and Merman. I have both plus the Witch and Owl masks.
---
I'm not sure if you need to do anything special to get the trident look or not though.... I have two "Heated Pitchforks" and my current one has the trident look but the old one is still shaped like a normal pitchfork. Either way tho they're pretty badass LOL
---
Anyone who upvoted this had not tested if friendly fire works on robots.  It does not.  I'm not mad but now you know lol
---
Probably cheated into existence. I seen a post selling laser muskets and it said "don't ask where I got them".
---
Seen an image of a moon man with a rocket in the side of its head
---
i was mostly asking for personal experiences on server fullness really, not official numbers-- but its good to know it's not exactly dead

OMG that looks *grungy as f\*\*\*!!* I thought all the backpacks were going to be those crazy looking 'actual box on your back' type things from the trailer! Noooiiiiiiicce!
---
I already have 4 vendor Characters; Weapons, Armor, Aid, &amp; Notes, most of them are already pushing their weight limits, and I still have my previous Everything vendor that's overweight with excess Aid Stock.
---
I'm really looking forward to player vending, as it will hopefully allow me to play more without the distraction of trading, and I know there are lots of players that will buy/sell stuff once they can without dealing with other people.
---
I talked to a level 130 Monday night, and explained how the trading process works, it was his first trade in more than 500 hours of game play.
---
That's a really snazzy look and also a really good picture! Good job with the lighting!! LOL
---
It's an honor. 
---
Bro we need a video tour this place is lit
---
Reminded of the Futurama where Fry drinks the leader of the planet.
---
THEY HAVE GOLD POCKETS!? &lt;3
---
hmm i wonder if it takes place of your torso armor.
---
Would be nice if i can sell stuff when Im away from my camp. 
---
I never said they should be forced to play fair, I’m saying it inevitable because of the way the game works, and the way you describe wanting bad stuff to happen doesn’t even apply to the conversation, the guy complained about people killing legendaries in one shot and I essentially told him complaining was useless, I never stated anywhere that I want fairness to be a rule if the wasteland.

Same as my reddit name: IBBugsy

Yeah it is such a overlooked weapon :D

Won't work in workshops.

There’s other languages other than American?

One of the three openable Domes, the non-Nuka one, is filled with radiation due to the research going on in it.  Imagine this Dome 1 is likely a similar setup, secret research / research storage that left behind some nasty environments.
---
Is it? I heard people wanted that but I’m not sure
---
Yea I got all the other masks u can get except the beret. Need that lol
---
I'm on PS4 but servers are set at a Max of 24. You'll usually see about half that on the server depending. Though it's harder to notice unless there is something cool drawing a crowd, like the Nukashine update, Faschnacht parade, or sometimes even nuke zones
---
Does pacifist mode stop that? 
---
Well done, nice teaser my friend lol
---
Lol, playing on ps4 is like single player.
---
Same here. Every challenge I complete comes as a pleasant surprise. I don’t get why some people are so determined to torpedo their own enjoyment, and then blame the designers. 
---
Actually my username is an off spelling of inseminate lol. It's my playstation network handle that I picked when I was like 19. Can't wait till we can change it here soon.
---
Funny those orbital strike beacons are shit on the SBQ...... pretty disappointing the only use they have is leveling player bases. 
---
Yeh gutsys are proper nobheads. 
---
herd mentality is a great mutation to see if SiN works. since with that perk adds the boost to SPECIAL from +2 to +3
---
I didn't say anything about Fedville :-)
---
Yeah, I guess I do hear it "Fayut" (or "Fay-ud") from some people.  But I went to school in both Fayetteville and at OHHS/CMS and "Fed" was common.

In 50 years it'll be Feh.

yup, localized in most of the languages

You might have the wrong subreddit? 
---
Been There, Done That.
---
I've done the event 3 times, but only been rewarded once, the server didn't crash, just me, and I had a friend that I was teamed with (not doing the event), so I was able to rejoin quickly, but didn't receive any reward.
---
Exactly, gotta have the WV colloquialisms!  Like Hurricane,WV is pronounced "Hurri-cun".  I heard someone try to pronounce Kanawha in a youtube video and laughed. (Sounds like Ka-Naw-Whu). WV has some...holler language.  
---
Jennifer Garner did a funny video on our accents and slang.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJXkDDj3P6I
---
This is a weird theory, but I think some of the masks have different names in different releases (Maybe translation differences or console differences). I have two Merman Masks, but other users are reporting it's called a Giant Mask in their FO76. Soldier / Napoleon mask is another.
---
This is even worse than what you have laid out here. I am very high level and if I ever own a workshop, it is a guarantee that I will be ganked, no matter where I am on a map.
---
All it takes is 2 players grouped. 1 finds you on the map and sits hidden with a VATS crit headshot lined up. The other starts contesting the workshop to initiate PVP. Then bam - you are dead before you even get the notification that the workshop is being contested.
---
You don't even need to be at the workshop to get 1-shotted!
---
Ummm... Huh?
---
he had a hunters long coat equipped, so i guess not. seems to be an additional equip slot. fallout 4 had something like 52 equip slot on the mainchar, but not all were used. they just adding them when creating the stuff to be safe for further content. modders loved that.
---
The reason behind these types of challenges is to show how fun and productive you can be while intoxicated, like real life...

I threw 4 of them at the queen last time i played and it did fuck all to her health.... i think i wasted a good 20 minutes before we all said fuck this and just left. i feel bad for that player that wasted a key card on that event.

I've seen shafts of light piercing the giant mountain I built my base in. It's all just a simulation isn't it? Idk what real anymore.

OH right I should have mentioned this. Soup is my friend (soup is his nickname since his user has soup in it) by he joins the battle once again I was referring to my last post that had soup in it. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Samesies. Crashed right after we looted the sloth. Lost my 1\* Zealot's Wooden Leg (woo) and all my other sloth goodies. But then I was fortunate enough to join another server withe the parade already in progress. So I ran over and helped everyone across the line. But this time Mr. Sloth turned in to a statue instead of a corpse -- just like the gif. So that sucked last night. At least I was able to get a helluva selfie from the sloth while everyone was getting their group shot on.
---
You must be on PC 
---
See WW2 axis powers for more details
---
That looks like the case, tho a Bethesda employee commented on a post about it saying that they would look into it.
---
Not with the way the current perk system works.  As it would cause problems when you unequip/reequip the perks, and what was already loaded into your stash.
---
Do. Or do not. There is no try.
---
It's the lake next to Middle Mountain Cabins. I have my CAMP there. It's the regular fisherman hat.

I just want to be able to take the 'AP pistol arm of doom' off them, and wield it like we can with assaultron heads \^\^. 
---
That said, since the last patch my executioner's 50 cal absolutely destroys them. Makes up a bit for my explosive minigun, which used to shred them, being nerfed.

Hi everyone, apologies for the delay and for keeping you waiting to be able to login while this issue was occurring. Following investigation and a fix on our side, we believe this startup crash is now resolved.

Is there a way to get the lead node and the acid node within bounds? I couldn't make it work.
---
Got the barrett as well in place of a plan. Not sure on rarity but I got it on my second event last night.
---
It's a nice utility to have.  I have been rolling with the X01 Jetpack for a while now.  Being able to pop a Canned Coffee and have a very long jetpack time is nice.  And using regular jet pack boosts to get around certain obstacles is great.

Use google. Theres a process to getting a little ammo

If someone is bothering me ill leave the world and stay off for like 30 minuts or so.

report that user.

That’s as may be, but the data has shown time and again that not enough people feel similarly to make this a sustainable model. 
---
&gt;	should’ve been part of the original game anyways.
---
That’s one Bethesda simply can’t win. Anything they add, even years down the road, someone will claim that it “should have been in the original game”.

If you have a lot of fusion cores to spare, for sure it’s nice to have a Jetpack. The only issue for me is that burns through fusion cores too fast, and my build doesn’t have room for batteries included perk lol

\#1 would be smart and I would approve if it were true

He's gonna be banned for having it in his possession

YEET

No. Not towards NPCs anyway.

Well yeah, and as a payoff free content updates? So what's the problem

Why "Trying"?

Marsupial, Jet pack, and Bird Bones means you don't have to wait for the Queen to land if you're a melee user

in a nuke zone people see a paper bag and think- "oh, might be some flux in there!"
---
so you cant really blame them, flux is a a valuable commodity
---
I had issues with the Mirelurk Queen at Mack's Farm, and the Deathclaw at TM-01 last night, neither one would take any damage from the first weapon I attacked with, but after changing weapons, I was able to dispatch them. this has happened before and seems to be associated with what I call tired servers, I generally find that when something isn't working as it should, then lots of things/areas are not functioning properly, and it's best to just Server hop.
---
I agree to this. I run thunder mountain every time I get on to just get back the amount of cores I’m going to burn up for the day. Managed to be able to complete it, take the workshop and connect power to the generator in under 10mins
---
good luck trying to blueprint it
---
I feel like it's more the X01 and less the paint itself. I think he's just tryin to flex *the paint*. The standard grey would match better with the owl.

The one that took place in  Helvetica  (that town named after the font)
---
Your agility should be maxed out at 15 to optimized the amount of AP you have. However, I'm pretty sure speed is capped out if you have speed demon. 
---
There are tons of food options (blackberry honey crisps for instance) that also increase AP, along with armor mods like custom fitted, Ultra-light and aerodynamic. 
---
The Lone Wanderer perk card if you are out alone will increase AP regeneration. Make sure your limbs stay at full health because running on broken bones takes more AP. 
---
You want to run 3 Monster Reborns so that you can recycle your Colorless Energy - which is important for untapping your lands quicker. Of course, make sure to run the Radicool and Tank Killer perk cards for maximum effect.
---
Shit i seriously must be experiencing the Mandela effect. I swore up and down it was trying wow.

Mission Accomplished. ~~WV~~ America has been rebuilt

Aw! That sucks! Whats the point in all the perks if they do nothing with SD!
---
I'm not gonna doubt that it's maxed at 20%, but I have been putting on and off Squad Maneuvers and I have noticed^((I believe I noticed)) that my sprint speed by a hardly noticeable amount. Is it possible that the cap is 25% or something like that?
---
I have 3 characters. A machine gunner in PA, a carbine with a piercing and explosion and a ganslinger with blood. I killed the queen more than 100 times on the pistols and more than 50 times the rest.
---
So here. The bloody build was the glassiest of all, I guarantee it. No need to tell how you tank the boss, the blood will always be inferior in vitality to the full HP build.
---
My fiance grew up in the Philly suburbs.  She moved here with me a few years ago.  I used to have to do a lot of translating for her.
---
"Owl tin" = "Aisle ten" for example.
---
Berry mentats and or popping your own stealth boy is usually the way to go
---
Did you actually see him with the sun mask on?
---
That makes a lot of sense. And it would counter loading up alts with legendaries too. 
---
I sometimes have trouble joining servers with friends. Maybe a couple times a week. During high volume hours in the evenings it seems things are busy. Early mornings on weekdays can be pretty empty for in my experience but almost always at least a few other people running around. Teaming up with strangers for questing was common in the early days but lately seems to only happen when groups mob onto an event happening.
---
&gt;Rather than bulking aluminum just sell it to a player when it gets heavy
---
But that would require social interaction
---
Anyone with more than 1 owl mask get get that one ;)
---
You sure you don't mean Mengele effect?
---
The best way to try and get it to work is go in third person and find room behind opposite of what you're viewing. The camera teleports behind your screen's view.
---
This is some path of exile shit. My nigga!

ahhh FFS.. sorry guys lol
---
how is FO76 anyways?

Gotta start somewhere.

You NEED this u/DingBingus!!

Nope. Thus the hearsay. Was too busy seeing which mask I got 😬

Ok now youre fucking with me
---
Thank you rofl!

Don't, it does increase enemy levels but if the butcher bot is one of those present you cannot find squirrels for the intestines.
---
We can only hope.
---
Oh sure, so obvious! I will try that right away
---
It's not to say that they cannot make it work, plenty of ways to skin that cat.  Just that the system the way it works now wouldn't work nicely with it.
---
Mixing up NH state motto and 50 Cent ?

Counter reactive plates with ranged or buzzsaw/ripper to tailor the amount of damage you do.

If the quest collect intestines spawns you won't be able to finish the event.

It's most definitely a dev room item

I see ya there my g

You should check out some of the other posts. Seems like a waste.

It was a great episode of XFiles.  Hope to see more.

Yeah idk what they thought but I made sure to be nice and help until things took a turn for the worse!

Maybe he wants to have a social discussion? Hence asking here.

Yeh pvp, workshops... Easy money. I've focused a lot on Pvp,  I'm not a dick, I don't bully and I have numerous friends now have battles with.. Plus I go after higher levels, higher lvls get a little embarrassed and pissed off when they lose to a lower lvl, they in turn rush, make mistakes and lose even more caps. The lvls really just show players how long someone has played for, after level 50 everyone is fair game. Seasoned players aren't necessarily good as a lot focused on legendary hunting, finding the rare things etc. Where as a Pvp player has the ability to pay for the things he needs then go on an adventure. I only seek lead, steel and ballistic fiber when out adventuring,  the rest comes from workshops, battles with other players and so on. I make say roughly 3000-5000 caps in a 4 hour play... Sometimes more sometimes less but I have all I need and I drink from rivers, I hunt when I'm hungry so I conserve stims and time spent cooking, buying food, which then give me more time to explore... Anywhere on the map there is something to eat, drink..
---
I see so many peoples inventory filled with food and drink, there isn't need. The rads I remove gradually with a perk card when they get to much and I dilute all radaway.
---
Got it. Thank you. I can see reasons for both sides of that 
---
Won’t matter since the other guy is still in the event and can not be hurt.
---
Ok. No big lose lol
---
I never knew that, Broken bones makes you use more AP.... Is that only for legs or if your head was broken would it still drain more AP?
---
The event is too easy! Even for low levels because there will always be hi lvls with them 
---
You can.  You just have to go outside the nuke zone to find the critters.  They exist all over the world.  And you don't have to collect a lot so it wouldn't be too hard.
---
When people do this to me I just let them slap me to like 15% health and one shot them with a bloodied rifle or Gatling gun lol
---
fsahion &gt; "practicality"
---
simple.
---
I like the concept, but I think the execution is lacking. The Protectrons move WAY to slowly when getting into position for the parade. Everyone has to spend a few minutes just waiting around doing nothing. There's also the issue of the game only spawning low level enemies for the event. When there's eight or more level 50+ players, everything usually dies before you can even get a chance to shoot a single shot at anything so once again you're usually just sitting around doing nothing.
---
I wish Bethesda would implement a hotfix to be make the event work properly if the area is nuked, so you'd be able to do it with higher leveled enemies that don't die in half a second. 
---
and the one out at the bunker near glass cavern since its there anyway (probably a parting gift for when the queen sucks)
---
[I don't need it. I DEFINITELY don't need it. I NEEEEED IT](https://youtu.be/HA1mbZ_MMh8)
---
You can collect intestines from critters outside of the nuke zone / helvetia though.
---
Saw one yesterday, closed the back door tossed down some Nuka mines and went about my business. A few minutes later heard the doors open and  boom. It’s all good.
---
That would screw lower level players out of participating 
---
It's been done and posted about, repeatedly. 
---
I worked in Southern WV in undergrad when I went to WVU and one of my favorite parts was learning how they pronounce their own towns. Hurricane was probably the most impressive. Really interesting that they call it something no outsider of the locality would recognize.
---
I can probably come murder stuff for an hour or two if you want, caps not really needed. 
---
Nuke zone is quite large tho? Might be to far?
---
Or your clan can just adopt one of the icons. 
---
It’s possible I guess. I didn’t test it myself. although if it was 25% instead of 20%, strange in numbers should get you there and be more useful than squad maneuvers besides. 
---
This post was pretty cringey.
---
Wait are you spongebob?
---
Oh this is gonna be way easy, Add me IGN Jinogiacrus
---
good luck getting what you need as they are far less abundant outside helvetia
---
Not sure what plans I don't have at this point, but still no rare masks.
---
Thank you. I will look into it
---
What hat is that?
---
unless they changed it yes, each pellet also has its own explode, and supposedly each pellet has its own LotD chance (i havent personally tested this one)
---
KK, gimme a few to boot in. 
---
Interestingly enough, I did SBQ last night on PS4 and we cleared her with less than 5 seconds remaining.  Luckily for us for the last 4 minutes of the fight she did NOT take off.  She stayed there the whole time getting pounded.  Prior to that she landed only for a few seconds at a time before taking off again.
---
Not sure if we just got real lucky or if some mechanic exists in the final minutes.  But had she taken off flying at all during that last 4-5 minutes we would have failed.
---
This is kinda old news. When I was just starting n the army they showed us a video of an older version of this with a tethered power supply. Not sure if it was the same company. I think they wanted to show us that our jobs would become easier in the near future. I got out anyways.
---
Was this a troll post?
---
What's the purpose of a turret tower in white springs.
---
Too bad you lose 100 carry weight without the Extractor helmet on, it must be a load-bearing helmet.
---
That's op lol now I want a shotgun toon
---
Let me answer that question with another question, have you ever seen Brick &amp; Spongebob in the same room???
---
AFAIK
---
Crippled Arms – Makes it harder to aim a weapon
---
Crippled Legs – Makes you move slower
---
Crippled Torso – AP Recovers more slowly
---
Crippled Head – Vision and Hearing becomes distorted
---
Only the old however you can find it on a whitespring vendor as per my comment above.
---
Ty. We are waiting
---
Just seems like an asshole thing to do
---
Up until recently, I was always workshopping.  In retrospect, I would have had a much more enjoyable experience just scavenging.  The amount of time and materials it takes to defend workshops is barely worth it.  Add the griefers and it’s a waste of time.  Add the constant glitches in spawning mobs during the defense events or trying to clear before claiming and it’s a waste of time.  Occasionally, I’ll get lucky and collect a ton of something, but the usual plan is to just get my investment back.
---
Contesting a workshop should not flag the owner for pvp unless they are inside the workshop boundaries. Further, the owner should not be able to damage the person taking the workshop unless both players are within the boundaries. Exiting the boundaries should have a slight delay - maybe 5 seconds, before you lose your pvp flag, to stop people from quickly going in and out of it.
---
However, being open to pvp while inside the boundaries of the workshop to anyone who contests definitely needs to be a thing.
---
Pretty sure there are nearly half a dozen opposums running around Flatwoods, and they drop them.  Plenty of areas in the Forest to find critters.
---
I’ll definitely return the favor sometime for you.
---
There are large craters near the monorail elevator and I do believe they are radioactive inside these craters, but they aren’t big enough to be nuke craters. Not like the glowing sea crater size, but if you could compare them to FO3 then it’s relatively the same as the Vault 87 and the White House craters. 
---
Thankfully I have calibrated shocks for Excavator. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have tried this.
---
Yes but then anyone not in the clan could use it also.  
---
I think I got it? Memory isn’t great here, and I abandoned camp quickly after the SB troubles. I do recall I did it by placing the CAMP in the cliff alcove halfway down from the lead deposit. Just start there, look down the cliff and you should see a couple tiny cliffs you can land on.
---
Good idea!
---
They're already so low health it doesn't take much to rad them to death. 
---
This is what players didn't realize would happen when everyone switched to Bloodied Swing Speed melee from TSE guns
---
Thanks! It becomes pitch black in some of those rooms in Helvetia at night. I saw the opportunity! 
---
My player vending is going to be loot mostly bulk crafting items.
---
Just have to watch the map, or you can start a 1 hour timer from the time the event starts up.
---
I'd like something that you have to be in the clan to obtain so we could identify each other
---
Wow, very nice. For some reason the picture reminds me of my Home Plate build from Fallout 4, lol. Still though, well done.
---
So you admit that he didnt break that rule? That's like saying that someone bought a gun which is the 1st step to a mass shooting so they should be locked up.
---
Took me a while to realize that the head was invisible 
---
It also does some energy based damage. 
---
I'd like the recipe for the b*****s.
---
Server hoop as long as needed. U will notice if is active 
---
I don't know how to get the radio to play all I hear is static. My jukebox plays tho. 
---
They think they are so special man.
---
I do this. It's very far from perfect and I can't figure out how to blueprint my whole structure, but I can blueprint enough of it to save a lot of time.
---
The ammo is in dome 2 but you'll need the tnt dome key 2 to open it.
---
Once you do just keep changing world or keep going periodically to re-supply 
---
I just want a clean refrigerator plan. 
---
I'm seeing alot of gamma gin comments. Definitely going to look into it.
---
As in if I got a code from the computer, and before I did my friend got a code from it, mine wouldn’t work. Your issue however is different if you can’t enter it
---
We have that.. It's called marathoner.
---
I see them constantly on xbox. They're always rocking the death claw gauntlet or a meat hook, and 99% of the time they're wearing the creepy clown mask and/or a swimsuit.
---
Nice the open layout reminds me of my builds. Yours seems a bit  bigger though. Nice work, loving the little pool section.
---
Thanks!!! 
---
Herkun. Cunawwwww. marmut. eers. and now we've got Fed. 
---
One day people will visit WV and find it like outsiders find [Tangier VA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZgw09CG9E)
---
Will do thanks! 
---
3 months later and your cheese min max build is now one of the 3 top broken messes of the game and is now being used by pretty much everyone, was it worth it?
---
I stayed in the same server yesterday evening and it started once every 45ish minutes.
---
1st one is unreleased and the pit was radiation not a disease.
---
You on PC, I'll trade my beret for a sausage recipe
---
Are their legendary drops? Because if so that's my new White Whale
---
The 5 Robots have their masks on.
---
I didn’t see the rewards list and only looked for the mask in my inventory as I had to log off straight after so I’ll check to see if I have anything else!
---
Noooooo....don't advertise our spot.  I've built bases in over 50 locations now, and this is my favorite😁
---
Got these yesterday: Plan: pile of fasnacht confetti
---
I can say without a doubt that we were taking slap damage and as unsaid its before and after the event mostly.
---
Has anyone tried a pistol build?
---
If you’re lower level, take over grafton steel, set up rocket turrets around the cap point and waste all the super mutants as they come out.  Pretty good if you’re under 25 or so.
---
Hello, any advice or news on the players effected by the "Account Not Authorized" error after the activation of the new content yesterday?
---
Hopefully. 
---
I've never seen a legendary version in my memory. 
---
Guys I played during beta and had fun but then I spent too much time reading salty Reddit and uninstalled.
---
Should I give fo76 another try? This pic says yes
---
Wow, nice. What level are you to build such a big place?
---
It'd be simple because they'd just have to implement buddy's functionality; maybe like the fermenter? It could cool down over time.
---
Legendary binoculars would be a real fuck you.
---
I never thought of that!
---
The system isnt great. Hell it's not even good... But its the one we *have*.
---
I farm players for caps. Sorry OP but its just the way she goes.
---
I am glad that pve servers are coming for those who enjoy that mechanic of the game. Fallout for me has always been a more personal game where I enjoy exploring and really diving into the lore. I don’t pvp and likely will never play on pvp servers. I think your idea is good however removing the slap damage altogether while in pacifist mode, as Bethesda plans to do, seems to make the most sense to me. Engaging in pvp should be a choice made by both players imo.
---
Berry Mentats don’t always work with stealth boys unfortunately. I’m not sure us mark 3’s have anything to do with that.
---
you can also have someone collect them first right before launching so they're stored. I am sure there is a way to do it. Why not try! Create your own challenge and have fun! If it doesn't work, oh well! Not like it's a huge loss!
---
Every so often there's a fun one, but for the most part they're just so grindy. Last night I drank 50 alcohol drinks for the daily challenge.
---
-------------------------
---
So I fast travel across the map to harvest all the corn and razor grain for beers. Over burdened. 
---
Guess I better claim a workshop because this character doesn't have thru-hiker 3. 
---
Guess I better spend more caps and claim this workshop. 
---
Good thing there's water nearby. Collect 200 dirty water.
---
Craft 100 boiled water. Woops, ran out of wood. Hey friends, can someone share woodchucker? Yeah, I've used my 180 wood and I've gotta go get more. 
---
Spend the next 15 minutes overencumbered walking around starting at the ground for logs. 
---
Finish boiling water and crafting 50 beers. 
---
Carry around 50 pounds of beer while over encumbered until it ferments, OR drink them unfermented, contract dysentary, parasites, and gain an addiction. Don't forget the radaway, because 50 unfermented beers WILL kill you with rads unless you got lead belly or an obscene amount of health.
---
Go replenish my wood supply for the second time.
---
----------------
---
Can't I jump shot 20 enemies? Or eat 10 types of packaged meals?
---
"Help a lower level player by trading them a stim pack, ammo, water, or food. 0/3”
---
Kill enemies with crippled legs.
---
Land 100 head shots.
---
Find 5 different types of Flora in a region.
---
Drinking 50 beers is arduous as a daily, and can't be done while doing anything else. Some of the weeklys this week are equally not very fun. They deplete in game resources, and consume a bunch of time that could be spent doing events and such.
---
The Master of Ceremonies bot in-game also pronounces it "Hell-veesh-ya," so that seems to be consistent at least.
---
Common inventory amongst all stash boxes to unique to you.  You stash something in your camp across from Deathclaw Island, you can access it from a stash box at a vendor in Watoga Station.
---
Im sure the damage reflect properties on weapons and armor should be able to help aswell. My vats guy(rifles pistols about 8 str...) carries a combat knife extra. It has reflect melee damage and take less damage while blocking on it, als one armor piece with it (coincidental). 
---
I am still waiting for the day soem rando walks up to me and starts slashing. Not sure if it stack or how it works haven't been able to test it.
---
It's way too overrated in my humble opinion.
---
I was lucky enough to get the JetPack for my X01 PA. I used it exactly twice, once while climbing some rock wall and the second time to get on top of the golf club.
---
It's using fusion cores and the benefits are extremely limited. How often do you find yourself needing to reach higher spots while in combat? You won't be able to chase the SBQ or stuff like that... 
---
My favorite mod for PA torso is core assembly. The AP regen is really nice, it benefits you all the time, no need to say why AP is useful in combat, and out of combat it allows you to sprint or run(if you're overloaded) a bit more. 
---
Core Assembly provides more mobility than the jet pack. 
---
Anyway, the jet pack is cooler, you get to brag in front of other people, you get to reach spots that are harder to reach for others. And ofc, the jet pack increases your epeen size. 
---
Yeah. This event will be gone after March 26, so you better hurry up and get in. I highly recommend developing your opinion of the game from personal experience too. The amount of people who dismiss and hate on the game just because of what they've read/heard is a real tragedy. 
---
I'm game.
---
Exactly, I did the event 3 times. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t amazing either. Like you said, pretty boring honestly. It would help if the enemies that spawned scaled to your level. Like that it would be more of a challenge.
---
Heavy Laser turrets shred people if you have like 5 or 6 of them
---
Really getting tired of you guys constantly shitting on us and acting like you’re superior.
---
I completely agree. Like I said, the event has its flaws, but I absolutely love the social aspect of it. Some high level enemies (scaled to players) would be greatly appreciated though😅
---
Well they could make it where you cannot un-equip the perk if thats the case. "Sorry, your stash is too full, this perk cannot be unequipped" 
---
 yes, a really well done translation of voices and texts 
---
The Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion or Troglitic Degeneration Contagion (TDC) is a degenerative *disease* that plagues all the inhabitants of the Pitt.

Idk, i once sold someone a tse gatling laser where it was unable to get explosive energy weapons and he was so happy he gifted me a marine armor helmet where I found out it was from the dev room, which is now unofficial released and even Bethesda announced that this item isnt a reason to get banned and ok to have. Same as the stacking foundations (which is patched now anyway) where Bethesda tweeted that this is so creative they won't have to fear getting banned.
---
When you get to a fire tower, go on the outside walkway and it will give you the option to survey the area. It will give you places to explore! 
---
And robots.
---
Great looking camp. I'm still experimenting and learning as i go a long. And it's getting better every time. Haven't figured out how to use 'Poles' tho 
---
It begins one hour after the last one began
---
I hope they feature your pic, it looks great!
---
Yeah, that’s what this discussion is about.  Just the concept of unwanted pvp...
---
On vacation in Asia until the 28 (hello from Hong Kong) so I'll miss the event. 
---
I personally experienced a few frustrations at the start, though I did enjoy playing through the mistress of mysteries storyline. 
---
Any progression efficiency tips for someone coming back?
---
If your on PC I can shoot you a bunch and might have a spare key + I will guide you to the bunker with the bonus of the Quantum paint(if there) on the way. I'll be on in about an hour, Trillian69.
---
Hope they address this. I am not a fan of PA but I always see a happy few excavator toons doing their thing having fun. Not all players are out to PvP or want to play alone. Most of these people are now more open to these exploits then ever. 
---
Post your ign if on PC. 
---
Ill come and destroy your CAMP so uou can repair it. 
---
Or you can take a workshop and stack items into the sky!
---
First, the game was never "As Bad" as the reviews were making it sound, IMO.
---
Now for the advice I give every new player I meet;
---
1. "Stay West young man", do not go East of the Savage Divide before level 50 (It's dangerous)
---
2. "Explore thoroughly", don't worry about the main quest lines till you get leveled up quite a bit, just explore &amp; enjoy the events. several of the Main &amp; Side Quest lines provide Weapons &amp; Armor Rewards that match your current level, waiting to get them at level 50+ will net you some pretty nice gear.
---
3. Save important materials (in your stash) and don't pick up cheap heavy things that you don't need.
---
4. Be "On Guard", but don't assume all high level players are evil, many of us like helping.
---
5. If you're going to take possession of a public workshop, try recruiting a High level player to protect you.
---
6. If some High level A$$hat starts attacking your CAMP, just log out as quickly as you can, don't engage them as they are mostly pussies that wouldn't have attacked in the first place if they didn't have a significant advantage. 
---
Rather than focusing on a weapon maybe make a new character based around a concept? There are a ton of recipes in the game and with the player vending coming out it could be fun to open a restaurant! 
---
Or maybe do a pistol wielding cowboy or an ex war vet using full auto rifles as those are two weapon classes you haven't tried. Pistol build probably not the best for scorch beast queen killing but could be super fun with gun fu and associated vats perks for killing small mobs quickly.
---
Well.. Maybe there was none but it was just perfect OK. One of the best if not THE best fallout quest out of all the games 
---
I experienced a server rollback yesterday around 9pm EDT.  It sucked because I had just picked up a 60 cap stash at the whitespring and it was 18 caps after the rollback.
---
Thing is, this is unreleased planned content that someone went in the dev room with the sole purpose of spoiling. I don't think they'll be as lenient.
---
Thanks, that usually does help! This specific one is neck-based, so it's an ice pack and hope, haha. I also get light-induced ones, because of course. Migraines are the worst.
---
If you are on PS4 I can trade you owl for giant or witch :)
---
I hope that’s the case about them coming in waves. I need em all! 
---
that would be awesome but XB01 :(  And at work :(  Thanks so much anyway!!!  
---
I will adventure and research tonight! 
---
Team up. It helps with leveling up and produces a lot more fun. Have a good time in Hong Kong!!
---
OIC lol.
---
Reminds me of better dead than red 
---
Well that's a point.
---
Your friend sounds like a jerk.
---
i am 66 years old .  Love the game. Get rid of the pvp scum.
---
It hasn't resurfaced, the 'bug' never went away. It's always been here. At this point I wish they'd figure out how to fix it. Then give every PA +100 weight by default/part of the frame. Then just give the excavator the +200 as its default.
---
Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. You do have a legitimate criticism. The event was pretty lacklustre for what Bethesda hyped it up to be. And while the rewards are interesting, they aren’t what I’d consider a worthwhile reward. But as you can probably tell, you can’t have too negative of a dissenting opinion in this subreddit.
---
Fallout games were designed for the difficulty. That was kinda the point when they were conceived. 
---
Post-launch support on a $60 AAA game? For free?  
---
That's just unheard of, you were about to say.
---
I have a 3 star executioners pitchfork (to which I added the flamer mod) so it IS out there.
---
You can just play for fun and run the event several times every day till it's over and see what you get. 
---
N
---
Tons of vids on yt
---
About every 21 hours I believe. And yeah the 0 cap glitch is annoying. I just try to sell anyways if I think it's been a day or so. I play after work and just do my vendor run first so I know they'll always be ready for me at the same time tomorrow.
---
We had one of "Those kids" with a death claw gauntlet and creepy clown mask who kept running around trying to instigate fights. Eventually someone took one for the team, gave him a shotgun blast to the face, and then asked me to clear his bounty before the kid could respawn. Kid came back all salty and just kept giving the angry and thumbs down emotes.
---
The toning of damage will never line up with PvP if you ask me. There are just too many ways to increase it that tuning becomes tedious impossible without breaking it. You also don't want to take away the feeling of growing stronger by their loot. Also how is it going to line up with the PvE content. PvE is really not that hard and the only reason the queens fails is because people haven't adapted or tried to rush into the zone.
---
Dude my favorite gun rn is my quad double barrel explosive shotty with faster reload. Thing wrecks everything. Perfect for a whitesprings run as well because it’ll cripple all the glowing ones so everyone can easily tag them. 
---
Four distinct syllables? I've been pronouncing it hel-VEESH-ya since I'm Canadian and they half-heartedly tried to force French on me in school.
---
Sounds like he really isn't a friend.
---
did they increase the budget limit?
---
You get ACCESS to it. You have to pick it when you level up at 14. Also if you are saving perk points- you can’t. Really you have access to Barbarian once you’ve SPENT 14 points. 
---
No.
---
He's  nice irl but in games  he's  completely different person it's  like im friends Jekyll and Hyde. 
---
I intensely dislike legendary weapons/armor just in general. That shit is impossible to justify both in balanced game play and in-universe lore. I bet the Brotherhood would feel stupid if they weren't all dead. Instead of power armor and missile launchers all they needed was magic armor and weapons they got from magic ghouls at Whitespring. Ad Victorium 
---
It's happening once per hour for the next week. You'll definitely have a chance to participate.
---
Literally the best fallout quest I've ever played. I can't believe some people didn't think this was amazing. The writing really gave me chills towards the end 
---
I'm on PC, but thanks anyway :D
---
Your friend sounds like he needs a cactus stuck up his rectum, and then violently twisted.
---
Or just talked to, about how abusive and manipulative he is being to those around him, and that if he values that friendship with you, then he needs to pump his fuckin brakes
---
If you're on xbox I can build stuff free of charge and plant food
---
Ya it took me a while to figure out why the robots were always so mad at me 🤦 till I ditched Pain Train from my build
---
You got me. I'll admit I was wrong but aliens are still in the lore and no more far fetched than the scorched. 
---
Okay!!!!
---
Sort of, they put hard limits on turrets and lights and decreased their budget cost so it effectively raised the limit.
---
The thing with the helmet was that people were actually stealing the recipe and mass producing them. Then they'd hand them out like hot cakes.
---
People have already done it. it ruins the event and you don't get any legendaries. 
---
Vender resets every 20 hours from the time you sell or buy something. So if you sell stuff at 8 at can sell again 4 the next day. Also the aero is a known issue but if you go out of vender screen and back in it should show the 200 caps again instead of zero. If it does not work the first time try again. If it does not work after a couple times chances are it has not been 20 hours. 
---
I ran into a bloody build yesterday, when I was killing MOBs. I got what was going on pretty fast when I saw the health bar below 25%. I just kept doing what I was doing with MOBs. Blowing up cars and seeing if I can kill mobs from a distance with grenades. The best part was when a level 40 Glowing Wolf came up and killed they guy for me. I did not have to do anything.  
---
Ahh im on PC  thank you for the offer though! 
---
No. The perk lowers the weight of what you are carrying. Since you aren't carrying what's in your stash, it doesn't apply. 
---
Cryolators can keep her pinned to the ground, but not everyone has them and Cryo Cells are relatively expensive/annoying to make.  I try to bring enough to do this at least 2-3 times.
---
There are times when she just stays on the ground getting hit.  It's good, since you'll get a lot of damage in.  It's bad, because it feels like the game is patronizing you.
---
I was salty when I first posted. I do too, though I don't necessarily like it. I feel kinda toxic each time I do it, especially when they have a mic and seem like they want to be left alone.
---
I’m surprised to see someone concede on Reddit, good on you. Aliens are definitely in the lore, I just think we shouldn’t focus on them too much as it takes away from the specialness of an alien encounter.
---
You don't even need to stand in a particular spot. Since resource extractors always snap into the exact same place and same orientation you just have to make sure one of them is included in the blueprint, get it to snap, and everything else should line up.
---
MAyBE HE wAnTS To HAve A SoCiaL DisCuSSIon? hEnCe aSkiNg herE.
---
Ok I did it yesterday but I was in a team of 4..I guess I'll keep looking to see when the entire server is in Helvetia lol
---
Thats the thing he's  only like this in video games it kinda sucks! Ive spoke to him about it before  but it goes over his head. 
---
I haven't had any issues with them tbh except somethimes they highlight me as well
---
Thanks man , I changed the language now it works  thanks a lot !💪🏻🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️ 🤩 strange bug lol 
---
See? Not so hard.
---
My point is... your line about "mutual combat" is key. That's it. That's my entire point. It needs to be mutual.
---
As for another of your points, I'm targeting this mostly at those players who DO spend all their time harassing and slapping players, until they either die, or server hop.  If that isn't you, then none of it applies. 
---
I had a small shed click into place once.
---
First off, find a decent melee/unarmed weapon for dealing with low level enemies, that way you're not wasting ammo on them.
---
Sure it does. I have several blueprints for various workshops. Like I said in another comment, you just have to have at least one extractor included because they always snap into the exact same spot.
---
I guess sundew is their official name. Bethesda described them as sentient cranberries before the game was released but I just looked them up and sundew is the irl name for them.
---
Sometimes  i wonder that too 
---
I've run it four times, and received toothy mask four times.  I hope I can get something else to drop.
---
In the medical wing at the whitesprings bunker.
---
Yeah make sure it has the mods on it that make it do more than radiation damage and shoot faster. I kill these dudes most of the time in one clip.
---
Well it's only WS has can't say I've never killed a legendary bot there and then server hopped their agro away. 
---
Generally it starts in the first 15 min after the hour,, at least thars been my experience in the dozen or so I did yesterday.
---
O

Video games or real life, it doesn't matter: he's doing these actions to you and those around him.   And if youre telling him to stop, and its not happening, then he's either choosing to ignore you and out himself first, or is choosing to be unaware.
---
Either way, if it's removing joy from your experience, you don't need thst negativity in your life
---
Thank you. I'm doing a large edit right now and adding pictures, so it'll be up there in a second
---
🤔 shear is grammatically incorrect, it should be sheer shouldn't it?
---
D'you think maybe the pun is a reference to the GoatSquatch? Or maybe we'll be shearing sheep? 🤣
---
I actually like how one player used their power armor; they left off the helmet and instead had the owl mask on. It looked super cool.
---
I carry 15 heavy guns because they weight 2 pounds or less when I carry them. If they implement weight reduction to the stash they would most likely reduce it's effectiveness in an effort to mitigate the increased server load. It would seem like it would have the same effect as when people used the carry weight glitch lugging around 1000s of pounds.
---
I got two dudes myself so far
---
My favorite monster to fall prey to. :D
---
I remember Logging in late at night to see of there was actually something.Shrotly after logging in I noticed only one lady sitting at the bar. Felt really bad for the person. He/she clearly loves 76 and it might actually be new years at the time there. So I walked up to the lady, she had the fancy black dress fro mthe atom shop. Dropped her a paperbag with 50 ballistic fiber and sadly had to log off. Was too tired from my own new years here.
---
I think they want to slow leveling, or prevent legendary farming.
---
I was there, thatn00b was his name.
---
PM sent
---
Honestly, if I was a lower level player I wouldn't ever claim a workshop except to complete challenges, then server hop to get away from anyone hunting players that way.
---
Interesting. If you don't mind me asking, what's your platform and origin country?
---
It's an Atom Shop exclusive
---
Whatever way he archieved it - thank you for sharing. :O
---
southeast of vault 76
---
Quad explosive prime double barrel is what I use on SBQ and that thing is nuts. Even better with Quick Hands + Speed Demon (well, before last patch anyway).
---
My daily carry is a TSE double barrel. Even though the nerf brought me from like 1600 dmg to 300 base (until I switched to a low health build anyway), I absolutely level anything in my path.
---
&gt; My vote is for a Mothman who stores his wares in his wings
---
MAkes me think of those creepy street salesmen who open their coats and have a bunch of watches and jewelry hanging from it. Imagine Mothman spreading his wings and there's a bunch of bling hanging from them.
---
... not realy ?
---
 I just happen to like music like that :P 
---
I also love classical music and i totaly cant stand all the modern metal-rave-disco-rock-bullsh..t.
---
Based on what I have seen (screen caps) and read, the masks have different names in different regions. Giant Man mask in US is Merman elsewhere. Toothy Man mask in US is Second Man elsewhere. Soldier Mask in US is Napoleon mask elsewhere. Possibly, Witch mask in US is Goblin mask elsewhere. 
---
Anyone else have the issue where your shots don't register?  I've started another character and just like the first one I'm running into the issue where I shoot the target but it doesn't seem to register as being shot.  I had the same issue when I did it on my main where I could unload a whole clip into a taget and it would stay tagged as though I hadnt hit it.  I even ran up and melee'd the target and got the same thing effect.  So is there a certain level you have to be to do this?  I mean both times I had issues I was lower level. I believe I was in my 30's level wise when I did it without issue on my main.  It just seems strange as you go by this area as a fairly low level character you'd think you'd be able to complete it early even though its needed for the the BOS and Enclave missions later in the game.
---
And that's with all wood armor I presume? Does it have to have specific legendary boons or just the armor bench modification?
---
:) amen brother, just primed mine the other day and am surprised at the high yield on shell production when crafting ammo
---
The other masks are uncommon and rare so there are only slight chances of getting them through RNG
---
Nice.  Base building was the best part of FO4 for me.  I've definitely upgraded my digs since the last patch, but nothing to this extent.
---
Water purifiers only hold so many purified water. The small that you put on land hold 2, the small water based one will hold 3 and the large industrial holds 5. I'm not sure if their production rates were fixed to match the ones from workshops.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Been playing every day since launch. I have a lot of hours in. I have picked up lots of good weapons. Not one single piece of sentinel, or caviler armor. Not even a one star. Makes me wonder about what people were saying about characters being seeded upon creation. 
---
I get tse, aae, weapons all the time. Never a single piece of high end armor 
---
Ran into the same thing. My TSE Handmade didn't even hurt him even with full rifleman and armor pen perks. With what little health they have it shouldnt have been that bad. 
---
I mean that's a bit ridiculous right? 
---
I been enjoying the **Fasnacht**  event because I am finding people my level to 1v1 or PvP groups.   
---
Being a level 180+ I try not to PvP anyone lower level than me because I don't know what gear they have and I just think it is unfair. Even though I have had a level 30-70 take me out. ( Good Time :D ) I just don't want to be that guy when it comes to lower level players.   
---
So I do the finger gunning the person and if they give me the thumbs up. Well we PvP. If they give me the thumbs down we don't. It been pretty fun.   
---
I tried to PvP a level 300 but he left before we could. This is why I been enjoying the **Fasnacht**  event.
---
There's no requirement that weapons do the same damage to players and mobs.
---
For a simple-as-possible example, apply a 50% reduction to all damage done to a player.  You still get your "growing stronger" effect, killing the queen still happens, and PVP isn't all one-shot.
---
I’m looking for the death skull one myself
---
Nope not blind. No such thing when you buy a digital copy of the game direct from Bethesda.  
---
What game(s) do you have in mind that does free content updates without some form of monetization?
---
This is literally the best kind, no being locked out of content (there being a clear connection between something that makes money and something a producer invests in) and no paywalls.
---
Would you have preferred to pay $15-25 to unlock Wild Applachia or be segregated onto non-update servers? Or be met with an excessive Atom currency cost to build a brewing station?
---
But I suppose a newsletter that you wouldn't even hear about without an active enough interest in the game is too oppressive. 
---
You’re “friend” is taking advantage of your naivety and generosity, and you want to find semi-rare witch costume plans to give to him?
---
Give your head a shake.  Don’t play with that person.  In fact, the next time he requests a trade, shoot his character.  Repeatedly.
---
lol you so petty you're going through my history?
---
perhaps scaling the number of enemies to the number of players in the area might be better then just adding lots.  If there is only a couple people doing the event, it's pretty well pased.
---
Saw a post here about legendary rewards for weekly quests or something? I forget, but I'm sure you can find searching the Reddit.  I'm on phone and at work or I would.
---
Thanks, and thanks :)
---
I could instantly hear the atoms store theme in my head. What an evil piece of marketing. 
---
Whitesprings is bringing af now. 
---
You are correct, the grammatically correct version of the saying is 'sheer terror'. 
---
It's definitely a pun especially seeing as the new creature is called Sheepsquatch and there's been snippets of events coming through the game already. Some of the defend events for workshops have been coming up with defend against Sheepsquatches but hasn't actually had the creature attack them just random creatures instead. Same with the horde events. 
---
Just came looking for an answer to this myself. Two months later and are y'all still in the same boat as me, and unable to scratch this off the list?
---
You're right. I actually like playing the game alone but i like a said im a nervous  person  and cant say no when he asks me to play with him.  I just dont want to start drama you know? 
---
I love how well the masks mesh with any power armor really. I saw a guy yesterday rocking the t51 Nuka power armor so me and my wife busted out the quantum. Normally we don’t play with mics, since we’re in the same house, but we might have to find some for this event. Haven’t seen a single place this packed since the Beta.
---
This is high school level non-sense philosophy. 
---
You don’t need to be punched in the face to fully enjoy feeling the sun on it before that.
---
They have mentioned before that when everyone is doing this one thing cause it's "the only way" that they will adjust things. It was the reasoning behind the TSE nerfs.
---
Bethesda's didn't want fo76 to be the TSE: the game, and I'm assuming they don't want it to be Whitesprings shooting gallery: the game.
---
Also, a 15 minute cooldown doesn't seem all that bad to me.
---
I wish that was the case but speed demon and marsupial make it borderline impossible. While this 1/10 Chara was attacking and one shotting my three teammates I was hitting with the TSE the whole time with armor pen mag, full rifleman and tank killer with bloody mess and I was doing almost no damage. 
---
It's just silly.
---
Easy there cowboy, a lot of good content and quality updates have been there. But there is something wrong at the core of the game. Not everybody will be swayed so easily if they can't work those kinks out or it becomes a issue that keeps affecting patches. Not a hater, I love the direction 76 has been going the last month or so.
---
"Wouldn't it be nice if we could log-in, and we had a lot of things to do
---
We could interact with things all over, in almost any we wanted to.
---
Oh this game is getting so much better
---
just give us options and we'll plaaaaaaay forever
---
oh wouldn't it be nice"
---
Did you make sure to read the plans?
---
that could be the case, but the lack of confirmation is what makes it iffy for me 
---
*insert play of the day here*
---
Russians? Kinda not politically correct, you know?
---
Proverò
---
Bethesda put out a newsletter yesterday for new items in the atom shop. That mask is an atom shop exclusive like the old man summer. It will go on sale 03/21-03/26
---
He's the one starting drama by bein a lil bitch. You can say no, and if he throws a hissy fit and guilts you into shit, then remove him. No joke.
---
Don't forget the plan for the most worthless of all, pile of confetti. I'm not kidding you.
---
I've gotten two of those plans for that, and one for the Lantern on a pole.
---
I found my blunderbuss in that new event location inside a glass case
---
Are you a fan of The Boondocks?  Cuz if you have seen the episode I did you know exactly why you think you need to add tryin to the end of that
---
Get rid of the pvp scum
---
Healing besides stimpacks:  If you walk around Flatwoods on the land picking Soot Flowers (blue flowers) and walk around near the river picking Blood Leaf (reddish flower on water or shore), and then get a bunch of dirty water from a river, you can boil the water and then go to a chem bench and make Forest "Healing Salve" out of 1 soot flower and 1 blood leaf and 1 boiled water.  It'll work kind of like a stimpack.  
---
As for your friend, well, that kind of behavior by a "friend" is like poop in an otherwise tasty milkshake - it doesn't take much to make it unpleasant and undrinkable even if it's otherwise a really good milkshake.
---
Thank you. I can 100% confirm this was my experience. They are extremely difficult to kill unless you're using the same methods. 
---
Thanks that’s one of the ones I want that and the sun whenever that shows up lol
---
I did the parade after a nuke. I didn’t see the nuke drop, but there was glowing enemies around level 68. 
---
If you do it, be mindful of the suicider super mutants!!! They got close enough to instakill all of the robots, and failed the parade. It only took one, and wasn’t even right up on it. Also, I read that if it’s during a nuke, the intestines pickup doesn’t drop as the squirrels don’t spawn. 
---
No i wanted to find it so i could flaunt it at him i know it would  make him jealous . And ive learnt my lesson  no more trading  with him! 
---
Good thing I found a Two Shot Cryolator then.
---
I try to keep at least 5 bulk Steel for repairs, and just gather more on an as needed basis, I have large wood sources close to my base, so I don't keep much more than I need at the moment, and never bulk wood.
---
In the Cranberry Bog there are Log Piles everywhere and using the Woodchuck Perk I could easily gather 500 or more in 15 minutes.
---
Uranium Fever event &amp; Scrapper Perk easily nets 400+ Steel, and I have gotten more than 600 when there are multiple players involved.
---
IF YOU DESTROY MY CAMP, I WILL ENDEAVOR TO RETURN THE FAVOR, AFTER I KILL YOU.
---
Don't sweat the sloth, he drops a 1-star level 35 item, probably nothing you'd find useful.  He does drop a few screws though.
---
I didn't reply to your original post, but I'm with you - I'm a few years from (slightly) early retirement, though I've been a gamer since before computers had graphics :P  FO is a *great* series, glad you like it.
---
Keep on keeping on, kids these days don't worry me, we may be a little slower, but we've got decades of experience keeping them in line.  
---
No it doesn’t lmao 
---
So far, we've seen pictures, that show several different vending machines. So I'm guessing that each one allows you to sell different items. There might be a food and aid, a weapons and ammo, armor and a junk one. 
---
It's probably connected to your stash, so people can't use them as extra stash.
---
You might have to bulk some junk, like you do to sell to vendor bots. 
---
There might be limits to how much you can have in it, like the Fermentor. 
---
You'll be able to set your price. 
---
And last, you'll probably have a way to advertise you are open for business, showing your camp on your map. 
---
That's all speculation, but seems inline with game. 
---
&gt; Whitesprings is bringing af now.
---
Autocorrect, or new slang I'm not hip to?
---
Two re-spawns later and he was no longer hungry. Poor thing. I felt sorry for it actually, so killing it was the humane thing to do. 
---
Took zero effort to find hypocrisy, if that's what you mean. No "going through" history. It was right there at the top.
---
I got blamed once even though I was only using a barbed drill, could only laugh it off honestly.
---
That reduced maximum health though, so shouldn't it still take a moment to rad them down to the small health pool they keep?
---
Lol. Back peddling was my go to also. 
---
I kind of like the affect.
---
Stand back a bit and see how high you can get the ragdoll robot corpse to fly!
---
I had a Watoga bot make it to the 5th story of a building, but I fat fingered the map/camera controls and didn't get the pic.
---
water purifier: hook up a wire from a big enough generator to run it, when in the camp build menu hit the edit button, then when you aim at it, it snhould say press "button" to attach wire, click that then click it again on the genny.
---
genny: you can get better ones by running the "powering up" event at a power plant, fusion is the current best
---
healing: you can craft healing salve (recipe from events/tutorial as a form of non stimpack healing, some armor has heal when not in combat, food and drink will heal a little, and there is a heal/time perk card that works between 6am and 6pm
---
area: depends on your level, each area had level caps for the mobs, offhand i only remember ash heap is supposedly 40 (you can probably search here to find the list) but anything savage divide and west should be fine.
---
items: there is a certain questline with a mysterious womens organization you can start, it rewards an amazing face item that also works as a gas mask.
---
thats all i can really think off ofhand, best of luck and hopefully others can fill the blanks in.  also dont be to afraid to ask on the sub with other questions, the community try's to offer help when we can.
---
You can try the capitol building. There's quite a few typewriters and desk fans in there.
---
Well, Wild Appalachia is finally here and...turns out no, they still haven't lol
---
Xbox?
---
Yup. Fuck
---
I keep wanting to say Helvetica like the typeface  
---
Your right thank you for your advice i managed to say no once i can say no again. 
---
I got the bonfire and trust me, it’s so cool, it even burns forever.
---
Yeah your not wrong 
---
Things are pretty active especially at night. The entire server joined the parade event today several times 
---
I think publishers are really happy that they've indoctrinated people such as you enough for them to actually defend the practice of overpriced microtransactions in low quality $60 AAA games.  
---
Especially since there's a multitude of examples showing that you don't need $18 Power Armor skins in order to provide post-release support.
---
It's a legitimate "hey wtf". This post is a month old but this stuff was announced back then. You're is just condescending with an old recycled joke.
---
This. I don't want a guy using a non legendary 10mm to do the same damage in pvp as the bloodied explosive gauss rifle. Clearly the person with that bloodied explosive has better gear and should be better in that scenario. However, situations where you can either become a god (assn/sent or assn/cav), or you can one shot people (bloodied sniper builds, bloodied shotgun builds, bloodied harpoon builds), shouldn't exist. That isn't fun.   
---
I also just don't like legendaries that are tailor made for pvp. I really don't want to choose between being effective in pve vs. being effective in pvp. The game is designed around pve, and running around in full pvp gear makes me far less efficient at anything but pvp. 
---
Honestly, just severely nerf assn/sent/cav legendaries, lower pvp damage so that you have time to use a stim if you want to and people aren't getting one shot, and I think we're good to go.
---
You can’t really be that many things on 1 character. By doing that you are limiting how strong any 1 can be. Melee/unarmed uses strength but so does a lot of other builds. Pick 2 that have different special requirements so you can build up both. I do melee and non automatic rifle myself. 
---
Nice tip 👍
---
I’m a dog food fan. Less work and easy to find.
---
I see your point. Maybe it could be a limited time thing like the parade or something. Like a random event that only happens once a month completely unannounced 
---
Aka: suck what little endgame is left out. 
---
I've been there a few times and haven't found it, is it a rare chance?
---
My bad lol it’s still early. Boring af (boring as fuck)
---
I'd be curious to see it then. The pics I keep seeing for it is the one I have which is called Second Man in my inventory.
---
See you on the wasteland ! =)
---
1.) The small water purifier can be built on land with no power. The larger ones need to be placed in water and have a generator hooked up. 
---
2.) There is a lot that heals. Food, healing salves, drinks, cannibalism, etc. Stimpaks are an option. They are tough to come by early on and I would save them only for heavy battles until you get to higher levels. Until then, food/drinks are gonna be the way to go.
---
3.) Forest/ Toxic Valley (first 20)
---
     Ash Heap/Savage Divide (next 20)
---
     Mire/Cranberry Bog (after 40)
---
4.) Screws, Springs, Ballistic fiber are the ones you'll hear mentioned the most. The rest will depend on your build.
---
Very fun event too.
---
Thank you for your advice!  And i guess there is flaws in everyone  some are just a bit more noticeable than others . 
---
Be happy you have room for weapons at all. I spent all day yesterday doing stash cleanup, selling/dropping weapons/mods/outfits, and by the end of the night I was capped again. I don't know how we fucking played when it was 400. 
---
I use focused fire with an executioner gun. Very effective against bloodied
---
ugh, 2 giant masks, one toothy mask.  All I want is an owl mask!
---
shhh don't give away our spot
---
Orly? Hadn't encountered those bugs yet, that's rough as hell. I mean, least normal things are spawning and it's completable, but still, sloppy work haha
---
She was still moving around and charging people.  But just never took flight.  
---
Live free, or be dead. If you’re not free, you are dead already. 
---
I think I found it after a few visits. I also seem to remember finding it as random loot.
---
I came back to the game when the update came out with a new character and I’m doing a shotgun build, it’s pretty fun to get up close and do massive damage while staggering with the enforcer perk.
---
Thank you for the advice! 
---
When the event starts, each of the robots (or at least, most of them) have a task for you to do.  Collect intestines, beeswax, steins, eggs.  Decorate the barn.  Play music.  It varies from event to event.  Once your group has finished all the tasks, the robots gather and the parade starts.
---
It's all one big event, and as long as there's a lot of people there, just do what you can figure out, it will all get sorted by people that have been there before.
---
Cool.  I genuinely could not tell, heh.  I don't want to miss out on the chance to talk like the kids and embarrass everyone - myself included.
---
Bethesda banned anyone who went into the dev room. When they said they wouldn't ban people for glitching into an inaccessible location, they were talking about the vaults that were already in-game and fully functional. The biggest difference is that the dev room isn't accessible through glitching. Its only accessible through hacking. And it contains every atom shop, unreleased dlc item, and piece of powerful equipment in the game. The vaults had nothing except a few unique syringes and notes. 
---
Each of the Free States bunkers has a generator that can potentially be looted. They're out of the way and there's no reason to go there if you're not doing the quests, so I find them there pretty reliably.
---
Had the same problem. Go into the "Manage game &amp; addons" option on FO76, and clear your reserve space. You'll be able to log in with no issue after.
---
You are using the word "friend". This person does not match the definition of this word. They will continue to take advantage of you as long as you let them do it. Block them on this game. Block them in real life.
---
Life is too short to put up with manipulative assholes. If enough people call him on his shit, maybe he'll wise up. But that's not your problem.
---
In the game, if you've only been playing for a few days then you haven't lost anything irreplaceable. Chalk it up to a learning experience, maybe even start a new character, and play with better people. The group r/fo76FilthyCasuals seems to be full of pretty nice folk.
---
Are you taking bout the plan or just the aid itself?
---
Yes 
---
The recipe.
---
Never said i have one character. I have 5 characters:
---
1-unarmed
---
2-2hand
---
3-Rifles
---
4-Shotgun
---
5-Heavys
---
Maybe Survival mode will help scratch that itch for you then. 
---
Live free or die is a way more powerful statement then live free or die trying. You shouldn't have to try to live free you should just live free and if you can't the alternative is too just die. (Damn that came off hippie like )
---
Thank you for the advice  it really helps.  Also thank  you for your  offer even though  we are on different  platforms it really  warms my heart to see people willing to help.
---
It’s worth repeating though. Every week someone posted about the problems with plans not being flagged as known until Bethesda implemented the change. Every time I see someone post about a fridge means that hopefully someone at Bethesda has also seen it and taken it on board for development. 
---
Pistol to me are useless, end game. Auto rifles and my current rifle build can switched with just a few perk card changes.
---
Ahh so the beret is a drop! I was like why the hell is everyone wearing a beret?!
---
Yes! That one looks awesome
---
Thank you for the advice ! I am guessing by build you mean the perks  thing? 
---
I ran through a nuked Helvetia last night. Pretty fun depite the griefers
---
You've got your answer already, but here's a solution. If you don't want to do a bloodied build, work on perking to sneak and vats criticals. Base sneak attack is 2x and can go to 2.5 with full Covert Operative. That gets you to 502 damage. Max your sneak to make sure it always hits as a sneak attack. Mister Sandman can get you an extra 50% at night only.  Tank killer will make your damage more effective. But then add the Better Criticals perk to to up your critical hits by 40%. I'm not sure how the critical hit math works, but I can one shot most everything outside of SB, Mirelurk queens, and Behemoths with a sneak+critical. But if it's a multiplier, then you can easily hit 700 or more. There are additional luck perks to earn criticals faster but they aren't required for just raw damage. I really wish the game showed you what these numbers would be on the weapon stats because you're never going to see impressive numbers in the inspect screen like you do with a bloodied build.
---
Give a man an answer way below the level of the conversation at hand, he knows a tiny little tidbit. Teach a man to find the answers to questions way below the level of the conversation at hand, he doesn't clutter threads.
---
Holy shit I know! It usually takes me about 20 to 25 minutes to configure the ammo workshop (locking and blocking all entrances, mineral extractors) but the worst part is energy. I like to build 1 fusion generator instead of 1 or 2 large ones at every energy needing location, problem is it takes a long time to string all those wires just right. I would love to be able to take it over, hit my blueprint button, and see it become the fortress I always make it into in a snap.
---
pvp scum
---
Oh right, hm. I'm gonna keep hopping but so far the recipes have all been identical each time I try it. Even the amount of the recipe the vendor contains has been the same.
---
Why aren't you playing those games instead?
---
Lmao
---
From what i've experienced the event starts again every hour or so.
---
I don't know your circumstances or those of your friend, but I am at the end of my endurance with the "It's only a game so it's ok for me to do shitty things to other human beings" mentality in online gaming.  
---
It doesn't matter if your friend is nice IRL, if they behave this way with you in a game, don't play with them. At all. Ever. That may seem harsh, but it's the only way to keep yourself safe from any stress and stop them being rewarded for being an asshole.
---
Apart from that: Stay in the Forest., settle at a nice campsite, plant a couple of purifiers and just roam the area collecting junk and putting holes in enemies with whatever you have to hand. You'll have to skip back to camp fairly often to cook meat, harvest a couple of crops and collect your water. You'll just naturally get into a pattern of collection and crafting that sees you get better equipment and experience.
---
For me, this game has rewarded slow and leisurely exploration and just going at it on a surviving from day to day kinda basis. But take things at your own speed. The worst that can happen is you use up all your supplies or get killed somewhere and you end up back at your camp having to do a little more gathering than usual.
---
Enjoy Appalachia. Don't let people be shitty to you, no matter what their tired ass excuse. Good hunting, friend.
---
Thank you for the help
---
I mean, i hit people with my deathclaw gauntlet sometimes but i always have pacifist mode on
---
Ideally there wouldn't be any perks or gear that increase damage,  and everyone was just like 30% bloodied all the time, then they could actually balance weapons. Currently the game has way too many wacky gimmicky elements that make balancing even more difficult than most other games.
---
That would be fine, if there was a new thing. I've been cycling  Westtek, Nar train yard, generals steakhouse, and events like awol and cranberry bog horde, hunting legendaries, but they are all generally an abolsolute waste of time. 
---
Nice a actually good tip for once. You should make this a PSA. I have never seen this PSA before but I have seen the same 3 over and over again.
---
 Take your racial slander elsewhere.
---
I am glad it is popular, it would be irksome to do by yourself. I just wish the path griefers would stop blocking in the robots. Fortunately it seems fairly rare so far. 
---
It's really entertaining when people are doing the "rock bottom" challenge during the event!
---
Lol.  Sounds like someone upset about being killed by someone with bloodied.  I run bloodied unyielding with a power fist.  I am not a "kiddo".   Father of a family of 4 with my eldest being 13.  It was a friend of mine running 2H bloodied unyielding build that got me interested in trying it out.  Completely left my PA Heavy Gunner build just for it.  I'm not a punk like the example that you gave above but just because that's the experience that you've had with a bloodied build doesn't mean to put us all in that category.  So debunked.
---
1.  Not only "kiddos" run bloodied
---
2. People still get "impressed" by it
---
3. I run with 11 other people in our clan and only 2 of us have a "set for it".  Not "everyone I know"
---
Don't worry.  I don't downvote due to difference of opinion.  Everyone has their right to have their input.  In fact, I'll leave you an upvote.  
---
Reactive plates have been around since Fallout 4.
---
I would be interested in hearing how you would recommend power leveling a new build with the best/fastest method having been broken and no new ones provided. The 15 min timer is a guess it might be even worse than that. I'm having a hard time understanding why you're implying that it's totally cool to spawn into an area and have no enemies there waiting for you, then your friend spawns in, none for him/her either.
---
If you’re on xb1 I have one  I’m willing to part with check my recent posts
---
It's not in the game 
---
White Springs seems to be a very popular area from what I’ve read on this subreddit. I will have to check it out. I’ve just been wandering around the Forest at the moment.
---
Really? I would absolutely love that! I play on Xbox One, so I don’t know if that matters. 
---
Water Purifiers
---
The small hand pump purifier can be placed in dirt.
---
All others need to be placed in water you will also need a generator and you will also need to attach a wire from the generator to the purifier the wires can't be to long or they will not attach.
---
Other items for health regeneration 
---
Take a nap it will restore health
---
Collect tick blood from Moonshiner Shack and the lumber yard this will have rads.
---
Purified water restores hp
---
Read the description of aid items it will let you know if it restores hp.
---
Helpful tips
---
Kill mole rats they will give you a strength boost when you cook the meat.
---
Brahmin along with Ragstag when cooked will boost carry weight by 20.
---
Play with a mic if a lower level player asks for something I will hook them up if I have I give out diluted stimpacks like candy.
---
The gazebo in White Spring just outside the tennis courts has a sulfur water fountain this will remove all diseases when you drink from it and restores hp.
---
Same.  The worst was waiting for my perks to load so I could run :P  That and no knowing if the event was running or if anyone was at the event site.  I'm pretty sure I completed one event before any robots spawned for me!
---
Yeah, a few people have posted pictures of it that seem legit enough. Still with the amount of content that's coming, it's easy to miss some of the bugs. 
---
I haven't been checking as frequently lately but I've seemed to notice the same items every time since a few updates back. I will check my inventory tonight to see if I still have the recipe and would gladly pass it along if you're on Xbox.
---
Lol, did one event and got toothy.  Someone still wanted to buy it
---
Yeah, it's on my crafting character so I usually read all the plans I get and store extras in my stash. 
---
I hope so
---
Hardly - being able to see at least what's coming in the next week means people can save their in game earned atoms for purchases later in the week.  I've earned a ton of atoms already, and still have close to 3k atoms yet to spend...  would estimate over the time I've been playing the game since beta, I've gotten at least $100 worth of atoms free in game.
---
Agreed, they need to increase the quality of the drops and add more options instead of just removing the best option. 
---
I so hope the FO4 hooded raider armor set gets released soon.  
---
Pictures have been added my friend :) 
---
That’s a great tip
---
Haha i just asked him if he is from nein. No offence, germans are beautiful ppl as every other nation. 
---
This guy young guy then asked me if i like nazi, i had to tell him, it is not legal to like nazi. So he goes with: "i am german, but not nazi."
---
For me funny story from game, for some people reason to burn me alive haha.
---
The Butcher: run around with a flamer  burning and kill things for meat. Sell it to other player vendors 
---
Others have the same issue since the new event started.
---
Yes ive definitely  learnt  my lesson. Im sure im not the first person  this has happened  to.  And thank you  ill definally have a look in the group. 
---
so many people are just lame about the event. they show up in their power armor and just post themselves at the next checkpoint where enemies will spawn. i love when people just have fun with it - wear the masks, jump around, let off some rounds etc.
---
You can only gather the items during the event. I tried on my second run through to have the items that it asked for but I had to gather stuff once the event asks for it.
---
Gorge Junkyard.  2 in a single cardboard box inside one of the boats near the junk extractor
---
That's odd 
---
Fasnacht doughnut recipes!
---
don't know if you found it yet, but there are a few throughout Fort Defiance as well. 
---
And then a car exploded 
---
Maybe Beth's way to prevent masks from being duped.
---
I live in Bridgeport WV. We migrated to Pittsburgh but had to come to this god forsaken place for the natural gas line. My mother’s lineage is Swiss-Germanic. Father’s is Polish-Ukrainian. Helvetia is a feminine image depicted in Swiss folklore. It is pronounced how I said and even speaking to people who have been to Helvetia call it that
---
It’s like alpha version prototype 
---
Still have one of these mods you're willing to part with? I've been looking with minimal luck
---
US and PC.
---
I read that as “hamster” impression. I’m still tired.
---
r/pitchforkemporium here! How much would it cost for you to part with the heated pitchfork?
---
The game is unfortunatoy dirt cheap already. Saw a copy go on eBay for like £5
---
Not quite sure you understand the meaning of the word slander....he hasn't stated anything...it always the German who stated it himself. Learn to read, understand  English mate.
---
Okay. This person is not your friend. 
---
What platform are you on? I can give you a witch costume on PC, along with a lot of other supplies to get you back in business. 
---
Lots of things heal- food and water heal, in varying amounts. Beds heal you slowly. There’s some healing salves you can craft too.
---
The Forest is good until about 10-15, then either the Ash Heap or the Toxic Valley as your next destinations. 
---
Water purifiers need power- you need to make a generator of some sort an connect it via wires to the water purifier (the small purifier can be placed on dirt, the larger ones need 
---
To be in a water source)
---
While leveling, you will want to grab all the Aluminum, Screws, Springs, and Adhesive you see (if you go to your junk tab, there’s a hot key to switch to Component view, and then you can tag parts to be “flagged” when you look at junk). 
---
Depending on your weapon usage you may also want to grab lots of steel and lead, and maybe plastic, for ammo crafting.
---
And then spawn in a nuke zone while server hoping :)))
---
uhh you mean fallout 3+vegas?
---
fallout 4 enemies would use them to fight you, block out vats and still keep fighting you while blurred by the stealthboy
---
use a suppresor
---
OP, you probably don't want to know how we pronounce Gravois  and Gratiot in St Louis. ;)
---
Following investigation and a fix on our side, we believe this startup crash is now resolved. 
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/329780/resolved-non-english-game-clients-crashing-on-startup-mar-20-2019?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/329780/resolved-non-english-game-clients-crashing-on-startup-mar-20-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Then why did they unban me for about a week? The email that they sent me from a month ago stated that they will unban me once the duping glitch was fixed I assumed it was fixed after I got unbanned 
---
Haha yep,  that one gets a lot of folks
---
Thats what I heard
---
That's what Raiders call "hair gel". 
---
Hello, I've sent a PM about an issue me and several other people are having right now, I'd really appreciate if I could get a response.
---
Ah I'm on PS4, thank you for the extremely kind offer though. I believe a couple of updates ago they made it consistent as to what plans/recipes you get in vendors instead of a random set every time you hop, I still thought it would change up a bit but it seems not. Kinda sucks I was just getting into making a ton of Chema but I need medx for psycho and psycho for psychobuff
---
Just remember when you are done using it for this to leave server, you may have people looking to farm you if you are not careful!
---
so you are obviously being sarcastic. I read some of your other posts about the festival. strange way of going about things. but whatever.  
---
Though im just 52 this post hit the spot dead center. I play with my much younger brother and im always falling behind.  Thank gods for passifist mode and slapdamage because I panic easily  and swing my axe on anything that mowes , friend or foe :-)  We elder people just need some time to think before we act. We thank you younger people for your patience and kindness ! 
---
+105 carry weight! Wonder if that value will make it in game, or if it will be lowered. 
---
But on topic, yeah, that's an illegal item at this point. 😞
---
at this point, there is no evidence that anyone has gotten any of the "rare" variants - old man winter, sun, demon, jester, etc. we do not know if they are dropping yet, but it doesn't look that way.
---
No Armor Berserker
---
Really I got it on my first event, also if you got any of the plans for the Swiss/Helvetia Flag, im willing to spend caps for it. Username is Crockett03 and I'm on ps4
---
The destroy option looks like it could backfire big time. Cannot consume, or drop must only be destroyed? 
---
I often pick up to much on accident. That's messed up.
---
Typical bethesda quality assurance 
---
THEY USE CURVED SWORDS!?
---
Thank you for the advice. Overall  i am definitely enjoying the game hopefully ill make friends  that dont behave like a complete dick. 
---
I feel like I am remembering picking up a backpack from a filing cabinet somewhere weeks ago. But it was only something that could be scrapped for cloth.
---
My recommendation is to create a mule or merchant character. Build them melee and buy or trade for weight reduction armor. I sold 3 20% weapon weight reduction pieces yesterday to one guy. With all the weight reduction perks and some armor equipped you can drop about 1500 pounds.
---
There are food recipes. Sausage and donuts!
---
[I've kept updating it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b37um7/a_small_sampling_20_of_fasnacht_drops_and_what_to/?st=jth4x6sa&amp;sh=3bb29ea9), this is my last 43 drops.  
---
Is it too hard to say:
---
"\[Reactive Plates\]([https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reactive\_plates](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reactive_plates)) is a PA mod that reflects damage. You can find more Fallout related items in that specific site." ?
---
then you could add other stuff like when it was introduced, where plans are found, bugs/changes from 4 to 76, where they can be found, or components required to craft because personally I've never ran into them myself. You don't know if this guy in new to FO as a franchise or what not. I'm pretty sure tho if he's on Reddit, he knows about google.
---
Or I guess being another rude ass adult on the internet anonymously is easier and might net you internet points.
---
It's lit especially with how often people nuke Whitespring. I'm sitting at like 6k Ultracite shells rn.
---
Sorry but that's the purpose of the game is to shoot everything except player unless pvp is activated 
---
Food effects are lost on logout/login. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2lljs/food\_effects\_lost\_on\_log\_outin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2lljs/food_effects_lost_on_log_outin/)
---
Totally agree, it has way too much "magic sword" rpg feeling to it and doesn't seem to fit with the Fallout world. I don't want Fallout to be super wacky and gimmicky like Borderlands, to me Fallout was always a sort of "Game of Thrones" like brutal realism in a wacky over-the-top world, where it still sort of managed to suspend disbelief.
---
Now we have a legendary weapon that does more damage to bugs, why exactly? Does it penetrate their chitinous armor better? Why wouldn't it be equally good against other armored things?
---
20 hours. You can try and sell, if the vendor has caps the number will update after the first sell.
---
Crockett03, also if anyone has Helvetia/Swiss Flags plans, I'd love to trade for them
---
Tbh I think it's just random and in the lap of the rng gods whatever you recieve
---
I have had this happen. I use a foundation block to place mine on. When i store that foundation block the disappeared turrets show up in stored as well. If you placed the turrets on the ground, you may need to place your camp down again to have them pop into the stored tab.
---
Same, I did nothing wrong.
---
Also sneaking players disappear from the map unless they’re a friend or teammate. 
---
No it could be abused, you could put on batteries included to stash mini-nukes and fusion cores for almost no weight, then switch over to bandoleer and stash all of the kinetic rounds, then just not wear them while wandering around. 
---
I dunno gramps
---
Sounds like a gas.
---
great work, yes, but no fun without pictures hehe
---
When I got unbanned I still had my mule account with all of the materials in it I just left it their since it wouldn't really matter because I thought the duping glitch was fixed at this point
---
Sure. You can have it, no charge.
---
GT Mo0kish, I'll be on later, 7 EST, or so.
---
Actually, it's more likely that one of the areas is tied to the Purveyor, and not Ever Upwards. The other area is related to Arktos Pharma and appears to be a habitat thing looking in the files, but there's otherwise no obvious connection to the two quests. 
---
Welcome to the party! Do you have a date/time preference?
---
Are items on sale no longer expiring from the store?
---
Yep, I'm so indoctrinated (even though I've yet to spend money on this game after purchasing it) and you're so mature for having the worldview of wanting free stuff without giving anything in return.
---
 Even though the example you present is *optional*; a non-important *cosmetic* that you'd *spend months looking for someone who actually  spent money on it*.
---
And because I like free content updates (that I optionally support but recieve anyway) I'm a brainwashed slave! Not like you, with your listed examples of games that were fully supported post-release without financial incentive. Name one Fallout game where  any significant post-release content is free, or multiplayer game for that matter.
---
... sorry about that, I was feeling a bit irritated after someone put some straw down my shirt. 
---
What is your alternative again? I honestly think this is the best post-release model, I've explained why, but some people are really keen to dismiss it because they only look at negative aspects of microtransactions as a business model. 
---
I'm not the PVP expert but if you can hit them you can nuke them. You need deep dish and some other mod to max potential. Give it try, it's only caps and perhaps junk lost.
---
Gravwah and gratioh?
---
This didn't work, I just tried it with Brahmin milk and it still spoiled. 
---
Lucky you didn't end up missing $10K and a kidney.
---
All. The. Time.
---
Its going on for a week isnt it? Theres only a few plans from what i saw
---
There seem to be a couple of gap weeks with no content releases on that schedule. I would assume that is intended, not a typo.
---
That's a masterpiece! 
---
Yup - I'm on PC and was in White Springs after a nuke yesterday and I swear I felt like a total feeb cause I kept missing with swings of my All Rise. I know the very patience lvl 121 (who happens to love cats - than you!) who was escorting me through was growing tired of my inaptness .
---
Was't sure what the heck was going on but its obviously a change since the last patch.
---
Dunno? Was more of a question, than a statement.
---
Wow thank you for the advice and the generosity.  I am on pc too it would be a great help! 
---
Which is why I said those of us who don't want PvP should get our own servers, instead of the other way around.
---
Thanks man i really appreciate it, will message probably around 730 to 8 EST
---
Awesome! Thank you very much. Hopefully we find the unconfirmed ones eventually.
---
Add me i have them for sale psn is RobertoMaietta 
---
Yup. An example would be, shotgunners rely heavily on plastic for ammo (something other Ballistic ammo types don't need). So for them, that has a much higher importance. Overall, melee builds will be the cheapest when it comes to mats cost.
---
At least 7 times last night.  The last few took quite a few hops though, activity seemed to trail off pretty quickly.
---
I poked one, he was dead
---
Interesting I see it a Soldier and I am US and on Xbox. Maybe a platform thing?
---
If you have played FO4 for 2500 hrs, you should enjoy FO76. Basically the same game with a few twists. Whole new map and quests to do and playing solo (ignoring people) is no problem. Does set you back about $100 because you have to sign up for online access but I feel the game is worth it, esp. as they have improved it a bunch since launch. 
---
Especially when you can build a CAMP that allows you to glitch into the mountain.. "Under the map"
---
#1: Guy afk under the map!
---
Ladydevann does not bother to read / reply to private messages...
---
THAT!  That's what I saw a while back when I asked!  Looks like folks are still trying to sleaze the game assets...
---
Limited time items will expire - currently those are the 2 Fasnacht masks.  The pose bundle will also go away, but you can still buy them individually.  That's the best part - the newsletter goes into all that in great detail including when certain items will expire.
---
Honestly, you should start sorting out your personal life and finding some decent friends before worrying about digital ribbons in an imaginary game.
---
Thank you  for the  advice  it will be really helpful! 
---
You learned the wrong lesson.
---
That's not what I asked.   I asked what a SET of d20s is.        
---
Helvetica
---
i did notice the servers get noticeably worse once they unbanned people
---
i take no sides in this, other than i get pretty sick of the server instability that has recently started again
---
Yeah. It's probably giving the event planner at BGS too much credit. ☹
---
You are correct, you can boost those stats past 15.  You don't get credit for perk cards above 15, once you've got 15 points in cards, you are capped.  But with boosts, the effective number can go higher.
---
I'd craft you a cape if i could lol
---
Because heroes need them!
---
Dude you misread my question 
---
The bots have a set time to live. After a while they die and new ones come out of tubes. 
---
Your "friend" is a son of whore who needs to have a hot iron applied to his grundle.
---
I didnt ask what a d20 was I asked what a set of d20s was.  You misread my question 
---
YES! I thought I was going crazy. Since the last patch, the number of hits that are not registering with my melee is insane. It's very noticeably different (and worse). This is happening both inside of VATS and out. I am consistently missing and having to swing my weapon multiple times.
---
I don't remember reading anything in the patch notes about any changes that would have impacted this. I'm hoping that if /u/despotak puts a changelog together it might give us more insight.
---
I also have the problem with VATS not letting me swing even when I have AP and am at 95% hit chance. But, for me, this has been a problem since the beginning.
---
But does it actually say "Napoleon" mask? Or does it say Soldier?
---
This exact issue forced me into playing 3rd person while using melee (which I never do) but I do land more hits this way 🤷 
---
Sausage and donuts, the prelude to a horribly, horribly bad morning.
---
Or, a great breakfast. YMMV.
---
Thanks! 
---
Remember also that the game takes some liberties with geography as WV is not remotely close to being rectangular. 
---
Good little vault babies get sassages and doonuts
---
That's awesome, and I'm impressed with the diversity. It seems like 99% of the people I run into are using Excavator or X-01, so seeing a bunch of different styles and paint jobs in one place is cool
---
Ah well im sure im not the only person that  this has happened  to.
---
And they fixed it \^\^ Nice Event :)
---
I am on PS4 and have an extra giant mask if you want one. I got three in a row ugh.
---
its so cool..i got the soldier mask and the old man winter effigy plan but my friend asked for it..i honestly didnt even kno i had it so i just gave it to him..i want all of the masks..after the event the PVPers were all hanging around..was like watching a show
---
god damn that is a lot of ammo
---
Yes. My agility is 31
---
No reliable way as far as I know, outside of just crafting them.
---
I was curious when people started saying they'd been unbanned but hadn't received an email notification.  I'm assuming at this point that the unbanning wasn't intended and has been put back into place again.
---
Make a Duper build then you can get banned so you can post the following.
---
I got banned for not looking in the bag and accidentally picked up 100,000 ultracite rounds or any other item.
---
I got banned for no reason I didn't do anything wrong 
---
I was collecting bobble heads since launch its ridiculous I got banned i only had 1500 of them.
---
And my personal favorite when will I get unbanned.
---
Hey Dupers are you enjoying the Fasnacht Parade
---
Yep I tried that and learned the hard way
---
Well, one would assume it's a... set... of d20s? Like, more than one?
---
Dang.
---
The atoms store deserves to be shat upon regularly just because it's mtx.
---
what do you have and how much?
---
I actually have decent  friends  hes just the only one who plays fallout. 
---
A set of dice includes a d20 but there is no such thing as a set of d20s
---
Well the ISS is now in the north part of the map, so you know where to go to find it!
---
Why leave server?  They can just take the workshop and you can ignore it.
---
Well, they just stole the helmet. Scrapping the helmet has a 100% chance to learn the plan, so they can reproduce like crazy once they’re in the world
---
It went away for like 2 patches.
---
Travel back in time and have Xbox so you can Buy the 40 I had in my inventory. 
---
I had to murder 12 small animals, they are food, aren't they?
---
15 max points each stat for perks. 15 STR and full 5 pieces of unyielding will give you effectively 30 STR for dmg and weight calculations.
---
Ok, so the other masks the robots are wearing just aren't in the game right now then. I've had the exact same masks drop as you.
---
I can't believe so many people insulted me over misreading my question.    Really shows the true colors of the community.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Oh i see thank you! 
---
Are you on Xbox? I’ll help you out with all that and more np 
---
Im hours new to the game and enjoy it a lot but I wish the textures felt newer than 2001
---
1x Sausage Recipe **350** Caps  
---
1x Branch Garland **350** Caps  
---
2x Pole Lantern **300** Caps
---
&gt;So the problem here is, if you remove the PvP aspect now you have a free extremely good way to farm mats with no risk at all
---
Golly, it's almost like the discussion included that problem and were talking about ways to solve it without PVP.
---
Breakfast of wasteland champions ✨
---
I've been all about that T-60 when I found out how cheap it is to repair. I seldom use power armor but when I do, the DR doesn't make that much of a difference. The QOL improvements from not spending 60 springs (screws?) repairing my excavator over the course of a day is tangible.
---
He treats others the same way?
---
The only way to solve it would to be nerfing the amount of resources incoming which would defeat the purpose of workshops in the first place.
---
You can craft the Flux Capacitor not sure where to get the DeLorean.
---
Right, but the question remains: why do those at all? For ten miserable atoms?
---
More than one D20
---
I dunno about most people, but I like most of the daily/weeklies. I use my free Atoms to buy everything I've wanted in the store. I've bought CAMP stuff, weapon skins, the Patriot paint, emotes, whatever. 
---
Most of the dailies are easily possible in a couple hours of gameplay. Most of the time the only one I don't get is the daily level, and most people seem to level a lot faster than I do. 
---
If you're not a daily player, sure it's harder to do, but you're probably doing other things you hopefully enjoy more.
---
the Pack had all of the good stuff.  I loved the elephant gas mask.
---
Bummer i was so excited to play the event again
---
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
---
I've always pronounced it Hell-Vee-Shah. Or if I'm channeling some of my cousins' more southern accents, Hail-Vee-Shah.
---
Set   
---
**1** A group or collection of things that belong together or resemble one another or are usually found together.   
---
A set can be anything where there are multiple objects of the same type so yes there is.   
---
So the only purpose of your comment was to nitpick on his grammar in a passive-aggressive way? 
---
I got a recipe to make Fasnacht Donuts. Does that count?
---
i had to wear my mr fuzzy costume
---
Most likely. 
---
He's nice in irl because there are consequences if you're not.  In game, there's no real consequences.  Be wary if he decides that he can do things irl that won't have consequences (whether he's correct or not).
---
Just an opinion, but I've had a lot of friends over the years (since before 'irl' was a phrase), and there are plenty of people out there like that. Keep an eye on that one.
---
Or you can plant the crop at your camp then store it. This keeps it from spoiling too and no risk of losing it if you accidentally get disconnected 
---
I did it six time with large groups. No one got any of those mask. Each group was 20 people large. I got owl, toothy, soldier, and giant. Then got toothy, owl again. 
---
Weird... I’ve almost never had that happen when playing instruments. 
---
Looting is how I received most of mine.
---
Yeah, I'm on PC and have a spare sausage recipe
---
Right? Like all the random paint jobs, why would those be in the game already? The cannon ones, like nuka cola, bos, etc, are in game. There's no reason for that red shiny stove to be in game. Most of the CAMP stuff doesn't fit cannon at all, honestly. 
---
Is the Giant Mask mislabeled as Merman? Or was Merman an incorrect label from the datamines?
---
Nice build! I used to move all the time too...but then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
Upvote for Spongebob reference
---
Mine would not let me place them directly above a door. . . I tried. 
---
Well then, I guess that it’s great that the game suggests this play style when new players discover workshops!!
---
looking for evidence myself. it seems the "rare" variants are not dropping yet. have yet to see a player wearing one or a screenshot.
---
with unyielding that has +1str and weapons/under armor/radicool you can get your str up to 40.
---
Hey I know this is a really late comment, but I live about an hour away from Nitro I spend a lot of time in the ordinance works around Point Pleasant  and was wondering if there is anything that would make it worth coming out to Nitro? like old plant stuff?
---
Moon with crashed space ship will be in atom store right?
---
i wouldn't get to worried about the legendary drop, its not a parade exclusive lootpool, you can just go to WS for like 5 mins and get 4-5 legendaries just as good
---
Ouch. I'm sorry about that. Knock on wood, I'm a loner so I rarely meet people (griefers or otherwise) so I can't really say I have much experience with it. Sounds like you managed it pretty well anyway.
---
Standard loot from ghouls.
---
You’ll have tens of them after a few hours of whitespring.
---
Maybe a RedBull and Vodka mix?!?!?
---
It's been like that for me since my first day playing.
---
I’m 37 and I’m the wife lol. I play fallout way more than him but we’ve been having a ton of fun playing on a team and exploring together. 
---
I'd never! 
---
... I can only imagine how much fish poop is in that water...
---
Im going to miss the fast paced PvP we have now. I get an engagement every few minutes with the current setup. 
---
I have to do a bit of server hopping but usually there are 1 or 2 workshops to challenge per map. I know where the players are, i can fast travel to them &amp; battle. 
---
Im worried the time between engagements is going to be boring. Ill be taking workshops then camping them i guess? Put my base near one and wait? Claim it so folks know im there maybe? 
---
Or everyone will just camp the vault lol. 
---
High PER players will be key for any group for sure... They get that player dot first on the compass. Unyielding snipers will have a nice advantage. 
---
I dont love hardcore survival as much as i love PvP.
---
Idc about leaderboards. I dont have enough time to be on one. I guess ill move my camp inside a mountain where i cant get hit. Macro my keyboard and go to work for 10 hours lol. Ill come back as number 1!
---
Is that Effigy interactive like the Mothman statue or the Red Rocket one?
---
~~You can make healing paste if you do your quests in Flatwoods. It's a recepie that is kinda much. Ashflower and bloodleaf if I am correct.~~  
---
I just saw someone already said that. xD  
---
Items you should look out for: Ballistic stuff. You need that to repair good equip to be able to keep using it.  
---
Thank you for the advice  honestly  i didnt expect so much great life advice  on a fallout subreddit.
---
Oh for sure, especially when they put in their foundations in these patches and then release the full content at a later date. Bound to be some overlaps.
---
Like how sometimes the Nukashine additions to Morgantown sometimes don't spawn in and all the doors are the old boarded up ones that are underneath lol
---
Bugged Defend Events are starting to feel like "classic 76" at this point though
---
I have the flag plan, do you have Doughnuts? Will trade for the recipe
---
It's an alternate timeline, where they read right to left.
---
Neither. That's a fusion generator. Just produces 100 power. I've been saying for years it would be awesome if it could recharge cores though
---
The drill would be really useful if they made it like it is in other games where it repairs what it's used on. Have it use ammo(batteries) that's crafted from an assortment of scrap, with some flux or ultracite being a requirement so it's not over used. It would be cool to be able to repair stuff out in the game world by drilling on it. Player camps, other player's armor they're wearing, mission related stuff like SAM's/turrets.. etc.
---
When the big yellow marker appears at Helvetia. Saying "Faschnact Parade Event"!
---
Server hopping gives you the power to do it nonstop.
---
Sorry about the sarcasm, I'm a dad awaiting my baby's bedtime, tranquility so that I can play Fallout. 
---
Lol, i had one on pc just last night at the parade punching people. I didnt understand what he was trying to do, thanks for this post.
---
This is awesome, OP
---
I have the finances of a single dad, and the red enamel stove is shiny I guess.
---
Hahaha I love it. I HAVE THE EXACT SAME ARMOR/MASK/PITCHFORK COMBO RIGHT NOW.!!
---
why am I yelling?!?!
---
It fucks up Adrenal Reaction something fierce. It’s a bummer because it buffs the hell out of Marsupial, which is really fun. And Herd Mentality buffs a little bit (I’m not sure how the game handles fractional SPECIAL though; I’ve heard SiN used to make stuff like Barbarian break because it couldn’t handle fractional strength)
---
It's gotta be easier on game systems. That or Bethesda is anti book. 
---
use psycho (or a psycho derivative) and endangerol, also I think the orbital strike works better when the targets are painted, so use the scan first
---
Not a single person has insulted you? it's you who's acting rude by trying to correct people and getting defensive when people don't understand you. Especially when you're trying to correct people about something you are wrong about, lol.
---
 Talk about a victim complex.
---
In an MMO, you’re often affected by the actions of other players.  Someone cleared the area before shortly before you arrived; give it a short period of time and more mobs will spawn.
---
You must be pretty chafed.
---
I'm right there with you on the repair thing, with power patcher and fix it good I only need a handful off common mats to fix the armor, and the 200% durability means I only have to do that every week or so at most. The only other set I use is Excavator with shocks for going on junk harvesting runs or if I find myself over encumbered after an event like Uranium Fever.
---
I find enforcer to be the great leveler with bots.  If they can't fight they self destruct and typically a few shots to disable them as well.  Basically see them as roving mini nukes at this point.
---
The trick for me on cores is to just pull them and hit thr tinker bench to repair them.  Way less time playing hide and seek with infinite spawn bots.
---
Nice build. I have a max budget house, with a large tree inside, that's smaller than  what you have built.
---
I'm starting to think the tree takes up a significant portion of my budget.
---
This is amazing! One of my favorite parts of the game is randomly coming across other players amazing camps! 
---
I love looking at all the intricate thought put into the details, especially when they are made specifically for other players to hang out in. 
---
Seeing as how the moon mask is coming tomorrow I would bet they are holding off on releasing some to keep the event going longer
---
Protoplasm checking in
---
Me and my friends were in Poseidon when we noticed 2 mid-levels traveling near our camp. One with a bounty of 60 caps and another with no bounty. The one with a bounty was level 58 and the other one was level 62. I went to talk to the 62 when he wanted to trade. All of his items obviously hacked or duplicated. While that was going on the level 58 was slowly going to Poseidon while my friends were at a junkyard. Instantly the level 62 snapped and killed me. I alerted my friends and Poseidon was already being taken over. We took all the fusion cores and left the game. They messaged us saying we were bad. I know we were playing the game legit and we suck.(obvious sarcasm.) anyway that was my only bad experience. 
---
The are out there..I have the blue.. Green .. Brown.. White .. All outfits.. I collect clothes.. I have a green hood I just found along with three hunter long coats and the longshore men's outfit. 
---
What is that old high-school still there?
---
So the recipes are not common which was something I really wanted.
---
Amazing.
---
It's all good. Most of the time I just ignore them, but this kid was annoying half the server and someone had enough of it. Seeing him get all pissy afterwards was worth it.
---
THEY THEY THEY THEY!? :D
---
LOL. I have 2 main personalities. My sneaky guy in BoS Heavy Combat who routinely murders Harper's Ferry with one of his Combat Knives. Little damage and just great fun.
---
 My Monster From Above. Full X0-1 with Jet Pack and a Combat Knife.  Leap off cliffs into packs of Muties and murders em' real quick.
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife, repaired to 200%, hits around 180. It hits maybe 4 times a sec and gets me into trouble at The Whitespring as I melt Ghouls a bit quickly for the taggers in the pack.
---
 Combat Knives are what you want. I carry 6 or so, and that weighs under 3 lbs.   
---
I might have to break down and buy the metal building set. 
---
Maybe making the spines was too expensive.
---
Drinkin' Buddy?  "A Neutron walks into a bar and asks, “How much for a drink?” The bartender responds, “For you, no charge!” 
---
Many people will work in a group one starts capping the owned WS flagging you for PVP across the server, the others track you down and kill you gaining caps, then the person capping leaves the cap reverting ownership back to you. When you respawn they find you on map and repeat the process until you run out of caps, they get bored, or you jump server.
---
If you hover over the event, it tells you what to do. 
---
They are not legit. A user with a burner account was posting them for sale on the trading reddits and outright admitted they are not legitimately available in the game yet.
---
It's great for exploring, screwing around, or getting to good snipe points. Cores are easy to get so not much worry if it's occasional use.
---
No problem. Great that i could help you.
---
Hope they will fix this bug asap.
---
Nice that it works for you.
---
He probably means the kids doing that at the new event.
---
I need to hop back on this game
---
My mom went there as a kid, we visited it a few years ago but it had been condemned. I think they were planning on tearing it down.
---
I see a lot of the European Codes going for cheap but I don't think those will work here in the United States for me.
---
I’ve seen welded rebar for a few PA. I’m pretty sure I can actually craft it for Ultracite (lol..)
---
I couldn't remember specifically where we found them, but I'm glad you did!
---
or die with anything in your junk tab, then the bag will be where you died
---
cool thanks for the tip, ill try those next time, though im not sure if it was the target not being painted or a case of players adding to the event and causing her health to go up. 
---
 Just hit Print Screen, it will dump a .png in your game dir.
---
Every hour.
---
I don't mind the exploding I mind that it'll kill you even in PA. It's like they tripled the damage and there is no wait kill the robot and it blows up instantly. There used to be a small delay.
---
Awesome! 
---
What are you guys doing?  I have been rocking my Excavator Armor for at least two months without needing to repair it once.
---
The beret seems to have been the rare drop yesterday. I wonder if they're doing a different rare drop each day.
---
7 day event, at least 6 uncommon masks (including beret)
---
Damn. So it was all boarded up? 
---
Can you visit the ruins of plant C or? 
---
I spend a lot of time at the old tnt zone in PP
---
Im on pc but thank you for your offer
---
Noice, thank you.
---
The gun or the rifle of which i can literally provide a screenshot once my shift is over?
---
More cactus, Janet?
---
Just like a little kid yelling I'm not touching you over and over as they slap damage you.
---
just plant them and store them, that way if you die in the nuke zone with anything in your junk tab and the bag moves you will still have your unspoiled produce
---
Were they made of canvas?
---
We (5) are all on Xbox One and we never thought of that. Thank you! 
---
yeah, people aren’t talking about it because it ISN’T rare. Somewhat uncommon, but there’s several regular potential spawn points. I’ve got like 4 in my stash and have left many more lying around. 
---
If you want, I can help you on PC, all my friends stopped playing so half the time I'm going at it solo anyway
---
Console still atm.
---
Yeah it was boarded up.
---
Tbh I'm not sure, we live in Kentucky and only go to Nitro to visit grandparents.
---
Cheater.  Report him, get him banned.  He's probably a duper as well, he shouldn't be in game.
---
TnT bunker 7, TnT bunker 2 has been accessible since base game
---
Somethings going on and it's not quite right, I've done the bloody quest over 40 times and only got multiples of the first 5 masks and the beret, multiple plans/recipes. No one has found any of the other masks otherwise they would be showing off all over these reddits.
---
Fuck this means that it was Open Don't Inside Dead!
---
BECAUSE... WE ARE AWESOME
---
Ah ok. Thanks anyways 
---
I think it's like the camp turrets, they are more effective with a spotlight
---
&gt;I got tick blood tequila sunrise from Biv today but don't have the recipe for tick blood tequila! 
---
That recipe is also from Biv.  My teammate got it a few days ago.  You can learn the mixed drink recipes before learning the recipes for the spirits required to make them.
---
Beyond the Lemonade vendor, I am not aware of any other vendor that has recipes.  And beyond Biv, I have not heard of any other quests or locations that have them.
---
Just ignore the fact that ranged players get free hits on melee while they close the gap...
---
The best PvP build in the game is a ranged build right now.
---
Remeber the tse days pre nerf? Did you ever try to PvP with melee then?
---
It *should* take ranged a few shots to take down melee. Melee *should* be a 1 or 2 shot kill. (PvP)
---
1 shot ranged builds exist.
---
Well atleast it aint 3x3x3 cubic. 
---
I'm working on a Mistress of Mysteries build right now. Pistols, one handed melee, and stealth. She's only level 23 at the moment so I'm not sure how viable it'll be at end game, but it's a fun build for now. If I can find a good legendary pipe weapon I might abuse the mechanic that allows them to benefit from pistol and rifle perks, but I haven't played with a build tool to see if I'll actually have enough perk points to spread around.
---
I must have missed something please explain. 
---
Can't tell if this is for real or the cringiest role play of all time. 
---
I swear 12 year olds seem to be the most racist/sexist people on the planet, i hear alot of horrible racist swearing while music is blasting in the background, dogs a re barking, and the kid is also eating potato chips 
---
No, you don’t need to interact at all to get the rewards. I tested being AFK in photo mode (with a rubber band) and I had a couple new masks and three new plans this morning. Doing the same during the day today. Chameleon armor and crouching on the top of the church 
---
Looks great! Reminds me how much I wish they would give us stove pipe pieces, though lol
---
As long as you're in the event hexagon, you get quest rewards but if you dont tag any enemies, you wont get their loot/xp
---
I think he meant Dome 3? Whatever one has the Quantum Paint is new, the others had Nuke T-51 and Alien Blaster parts/ammo
---
I have the flag plan but looking for the doughnut recipe
---
Any question on Reddit can be responded with a lmgtfy. I better see every question on Reddit with your response being as such now.
---
Or you can start thinking of Reddit as a place of discussion.
---
When I first started playing 76 I was worried about when I die do I lose my weapons? thank god we don't, could you imagine lol 
---
I haven't been able to fix it at all. Although, I haven't been playing lately
---
I think LA have always hit a little harder than Hunting/Sniper rifles. The downside to them is they don’t have magazine mods, so you can’t add more armor piercing (or a larger magazine). 
---
That IS balance in my book. Although the LA also having 3x the fire rate is a bit unbalanced
---
Marty!! come look at this!  Our marketing team fucked up!  
---
I just logged in for the first time yesterday, the event was up so I fast traveled to it. I was there maybe 30 seconds before the event completed and I got a mask and a plan.
---
Just server hop, that's best bet
---
They're cheap to craft. 
---
yep starts at the 15th minute
---
Most of the time the only thing I need to repair is the legs due to them getting munched on by all the mobs during SBQ fights. I honestly don't recall the last time I had to repair the torso.
---
Awesome! I found that cave myself. Totally want to build in there, too. Was thinking about if I start a new character I'd have it there as like a wild man living in a cave RP. 
---
430 hours in..ive never stumbled upon a cave
---
Door 7 has the quantum, 5 has the nuka t-51 and I believe 2 was alien blaster stuff
---
Man oh man that takes me back!
---
This sounds plausible, bethesda should really say if this is the case though 
---
I've been playing the whole time, I just gave up on this one forever ago. But I was sitting around deciding what to do between Parade Events and thought I'd see if anyone had found a fix for this. And no. It must be for future content I guess, that seems to be the general theory/consensus
---
Only the collector edition books...
---
You'll still get rewards, regardless of how much you collected/shot. Just make sure you get a shot on the legendary at the end, it wont give high level stuff or anything, but it may be ok for lower levels to use.
---
I joined my first parade right at the end, not even sure I managed to get a shot on the last enemy. But I still got a reward - a mask and plans for something or other. 
---
You are obviously better to get there and help with it all, but sometimes it works out you cant. Either way, you get rewards.
---
You absolutely have the ability to go into photo mode as long as the instrument is placed in a manner that allows it. I'm on the bass in this pic and everyone of the people playing can get into photo mode. If you are getting that error the instrument is placed wrong.
---
   https://i.imgur.com/PyBzH5Y.png
---
Lvl 500 with nuke codes *breathing heavily*
---
Ok. I'm out of ideas. Sorry hope it gets fixed
---
Sounds like a str agi build. Shouldn’t need perception, or end. So you should have plenty of points.
---
Agi with be your pistols/stealth and I think with 12 str you can run all the melee perks you would need.
---
Maybe. Doubt it though. I really want monsters to be buffed to make it so you either need to really be geared up / have the right meds or be in a group
---
So they fixes Vats for guns (its been broken since day 1) and it breaks it for melee? That sucks
---
Sounds right!
---
You're just a Bethesda hater 
---
So there is no level requirement? I just started playing again recently and am only level 8.
---
If you buy stuff from the vendor, a portion of the caps you spend become available for the vendor to buy from you. I generally start out selling a few things, buying a few things, etc. 
---
Yeah, I like to use rippers and overly generous to tear people up with rads and it’s really funny to watch their health just plummet.
---
Step 1- hop on YouTube and watch a few beginner guide videos, they'll help you get started. 
---
Step 2-  ditch that "friend"  
---
yeah I think it will be for a future story too. I really want to meet her in person 
---
Some of the masks like that one seem to be named different for different people. My best guess so far is different platforms have different names. Otherwise it's the same mask
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes
---
Seems that's just a family of ticks.
---
Love it. 
---
No level requirement :)
---
It's worth noting that Bethesda announced that when survival mode is released they're also changing the mechanics of Pacifist mode so that other players won't be able to do any damage to you or your camp, so camp griefing will soon be a thing of the past.
---
Yes i know that but what is allowed is pretty restricted
---
Yah, only time you see that many players is scorched earth and that's always so chaotic and stressful. This is a social event. Checking out other players outfits, masks. Really fun.
---
I hope they add more stuff like this.
---
Wwoooooow dude
---
So that T-60 black - red paint and the black excavator paint... How? 
---
It's says 75 above it like it's a legendary perk? 
---
I ran about 10 and had 2 disconnects. I did have a lot of lag and rubber banding during some of the more populated ones. 
---
Furious Drills anyone? 🤣
---
Wouldn't be hard. It'd work similar to the Fermenter except it would slow down the spoilage considerably and it would have a limit of how many things could be placed inside. 
---
Turrets get wrecked by SBs.  It’s quite sad.
---
I'm not the only one!!  I think it was meant to nerf melee, but other players can't dodge like that so it only made the already-a-pain-in-the-ass-bullet-sponge enemies even harder to fight while doing nothing to PvP...
---
Exactly, I agree that melee does a lot of damage, but it’s nothing compared to a well-built ranged build
---
You, sir, are a devious individual. 
---
Wish I would have thought of that before I left for work this morning...
---
Cheaper with super duper!
---
I’m constantly in Sneak, so he never Aggros to me, but it does make fast travel hard. I honestly never noticed how he kinda drifts towards me though, even though I’m hidden. It makes a lot of sense however. 
---
Only once so far have I had to deal with the entourage, and they literally spawned in the camp, which was lame. 
---
I guess if you’re constantly sneaking it’s a chill spot, but don’t stand up. Ever. 
---
I have two of them in my inventory, both called "Toothy Man".
---
US, PS4.
---
Dude on the fallout discord got the old man winter mask. So yes they are dropping.
---
Oh no only the blunderbuss doesn't spawn as legendary 
---
Thank you id really appreciate  that 
---
I always called it Hell-Vet-Ika
---
Nice. I’m trash, but I’m gonna hop on and see what I can do, I’m a sucker for goofy cosmetics. 
---
I’ve noticed that using VATS in PA isn’t as bad as draining as it used to be. Might be my imagination, might not.
---
How do you trade equipment? I'm guessing this doesn't work for console players?
---
Could just be an error (there is a few kicking around, such as a clock that is back to front. Cant recall where but pretty sure it's in a train station somewhere). 
---
However it could be on purpose. I've heard tell people in real life do just this. I have no idea why, but they do (maybe they don't want multicoloured spines messing up their colour scheme or they are just plain embarrassed about their reading choices, who knows!). Perhaps a resident of the house had some sort of thing like that going on.
---
Helvetia....I don’t know where that is does it show up like a standard event?
---
🤷 ya maybe. She **does** seem to be the only living person left in the damned State other than the Players 🤣
---
I got mine over a door. I'll post a screenshot when I'm off work
---
I haven’t built it yet, but a guy in my party did and I thought he said it was lit but static.
---
Oh dang, want to trade?
---
Does anyone else have a bug where daily quests do not reactivate?
---
I think you mean Dead Don't Inside Open
---
I think the server gets a notification when the event spawns. Keep an eye out for it. You need to explore some more!
---
"tons of people"
---
You mean 'some' people on this sub... This sub represents about 5% of the total player base. Out of the 5% here there were a handful of people complaining. You say "tons" in reality it's less than 1% of the player base. 
---
Fast travel to nearest location (e.g. Helvetia) and run back will fix it. This happened to me yesterday as well.
---
If only we could have known
---
Looks amazing!
---
Also where do I go to start it? 
---
Hope in the future of this game.
---
Caps Lock is default PTT, as far as not hearing people, I would check your audio settings. I have seen some players who had some kind of setting on that muted them and restricted you from sending them party invites, you could have this setting on possibly but I don’t know what the setting is called or where it would be in the menus. 
---
DID SOMEBODY SAY PLAAAAAAAAASTIC?!
---
PLAAAAAAAAAASTIC!
---
Was this around 15 hours ago, on PC? I was there, and I thought it was one person showing off their collection. It was getting placed so fast, cool that it was a bunch of different people doing it.
---
 I'm building an Auto Grenade Launcher response to the Bloodied Griefer crowd. 
---
 My char takes no explosive damage and I have all the Explosive perks. I also have 2 levels of the Luck Stagger chance and my plan is simply to empty it into the ground at our feet. I dunno, it kills the Mothman. ;)
---
Yeah.  The sad part is, I'm pretty sure I had one of those a long time ago, but I ended up getting rid of it because "Pfft, what am I going to do with this?"
---
Course, I have a Quad Cryolator now, which is nice because I can literally keep firing until she's totally frozen.
---
I had a 3hr once.
---
I came across an old timer in Fort Venture, we scared the hell out of each other because we were both creeping around and we shot each other in the face when we both turned the same corner hahaha, we laughed about it and talked a bit, said he was farming technical data, one of the nicest people I ever met on the game
---
Always remember to respect your elders and remember that they are human too.
---
You could do that before the patch, same with npc vendors.  Now I have no idea what the Stars are for on legendary weapons until I buy them!  Hoping they fix it back
---
ah ok! thank you for this info!
---
I'll of course will try to participate for fun, but at least if im not able to get any hits in, ill know its not all for naught!
---
Ok, I totally believe you that you did. I was in a hurry this morning, so when it didn't want to cooperate I just moved on. Maybe that was for the best, lol.
---
You need a thesaurus, STAT. 
---
Looks totally legit!
---
2, 3, and 7, I believe.  No 5.
---
how are you defining rare?
---
The only mask I've found in the wild,so to speak, was the fashnacht man mask.  Had that for a month or so.
---
IIRC, one mask is available in the Atom store, so for the time being, it may not be part of the event drop list.
---
its the town of Helvetia, its just northeast of Sutton
---
Good question. I know it can at least guard your camp. I saw an article where a player created a maze with a death claw they had tamed in it. I've never focused on those perks though, so I'm not sure. 
---
It's pronounced Wed-Nes-Day, not Winds-Day/Wends-Day.  The English languish, whether European or American like to over simplify pronunciations to make them roll off their tongue easier; and given how much of the world was under rule of an English nation at some point, it's no surprise when non English countries start using the incorrect pronunciations.
---
At least they haven't found a way to simplify the pronunciation of Celtic words/names.
---
ah ok! thank you!
---
they are only mad cos they don't get the loot the enemies drop
---
I wouldn’t stick to a particular bullet type early on since you probably can’t afford to take several levels to get super duper and ammosmith. When you’re still leveling to 50 I would use whatever ammo you have a bunch of, I swapped between shotguns, rifles, even melee while leveling. The enemies aren’t so hard as to require specific gun type perks.
---
Nice! I love seeing what others build. :)
---
I always had difficulty hitting stuff. I almost never use VATS. I guess it is just ever so slighly worsened that I didn't recognise it?
---
Yeah I noticed how much nicer VATS was working on my alt.  They are low level and use a hunting rifle and it was very nice to take out several targets.  
---
The “Someone to Talk to” quest (where you shoot quest animals with vox syringer and record what they say) gave me a herd of cats at the billboard behind Blackwater Mine. I’m pretty sure it RNGs random creatures and locations though. They ran away once I tried to syringer them so I used the CHR perk to pacify one. It said some very weird things but AFAIK it never appeared in my camp.
---
I had server crash on me on the final step and I had to do it twice. Kinda remind of D.C.'s DMV actually. 
---
cam to say this
---
Did he provide pics? if so can you link?
---
Thank you ill keep an eye out for that 
---
Lol i don't move anynore, just renovations
---
Wow you are crazy, when i lose 199caps on my first death, pacifist mode, server hop.
---
I had server crash on me on the final step and I had to do it twice. Kinda reminds me of D.C.'s DMV actually.
---
Yeah, I can never get melee to work. I blame my internet, but it's probably the game partly, too.
---
I want to believe that's a possibility... but at the same time, I think about the shortcomings of the quest itself, and ask myself "Could they have really put that much thought into this?"
---
Maybe if you set it on fire...still don't know what the clown costume has to do with it...
---
most people are in team chat, or on discord, they usually only switch to area in someone else is in area chat and addressing them
---
Who reads books?  
---
Cuts into Frat Party time....
---
Remove any game mods you may have installed. Backup and delete your custom .ini files.
---
If that works, then you know where to start looking.
---
Tell me how doing way more damage and still not dying is inferior to doing way less dmg and not dying?
---
The tree inside would be awesome! I'm not sure how much it'd actually take up on your budget though. I do wish there was a way to clear a lot as the building system is a real pain with some of the landscaping.
---
ha! point proven!   why are you so mad with Bethesda anyway?
---
please point out on the doll where they touched you
---
I stopped giving any fucks at all about the event after I did it once and got nothing. 
---
Its boring and too easy.
---
Cool thanks. 
---
Btw: it start on different time on each server and event last around 20minutes so it take 1-5server hops till you get on server with running event.
---
Sure, my username is Sirrockyqo, add me
---
Really appreciate the response, already made mine though lol. Thanks though
---
Lemonade stand vendor, insult bot

Helvetia, it's on the river south of Morgantown. There'll be a global notification each time the event starts (once every hour or so). Just show up :)
---
White springs can be really good, but I've found there tends to be a lot of people there. I've got PC, so there might be cross play (gonna need to research if it's possible). If there is I can probably hold the aggro of the ghouls for you. 
---
I disagree on the mutual part only insofar as there should be some way to kill a nonresponsive to PvP player. An example would be the ability to attack an obviously overencumbered player in order to steal their junk,  which is one of the instances where I will attempt to "grief " them to death because I've gotten a large amount of very good stuff (ballistic fiber, stable flux,  screws  etc.)from "murdering" players. 
---
I actually like that it makes doors unusable as I wanted a way to make my generator room not accessible to other people. 
---
I've been fiddling around a bit, and this seems like a viable build. I could also ditch the rifleman perks to get some other QoL stuff like Hard Bargain 3 or another couple ranks of Lone Wanderer. I like having Traveling Pharmacy, but I could also remove that and get 3 more STR points to add to the gladiator perk cards.

Workshops are literally the worst way to farm materials in the game. Find a good loot run, do that instead.
---
50 years old here as well.
---
I still HAVE that Sears/Roebuck Pong knockoff.  Uses 6 D-Cell batteries.  Both paddle controllers on it too.
---
Still have my ColecoVision too.  Both controllers are toast, though.
---
First real computer games were Temple of Apshai and Castle Wolfenstein (both on Apple \]\[+).  I started learning much earlier, though.....on CP/M homebrews from HeathKit (remember them?) and practicing writing my own stuff on the TRS-80 Model II at the mall when the Radio Shack employees weren't watching......

Mole miner gauntlets and missile launchers 
---
I just checked and my metal chest is actually 122 base resistance, and it will be higher than that once I add polished mod.
---
Are you on PS4 
---
nope.
---
"hell-Vee-shuh"
---
this is the proper way, i have relatives who live there.  super mutant relatives.
---
I don't know about reliably.
---
There is a random encounter where two Deathclaws are guarding a nest, although one is usually killed by Super Mutants.
---
Actually Bethesda is good. People that criticize them are really getting on my nerve. It's like these people get off on bullying this defenseless megacorp. 
---
That would be proper.  In STL it's GRA-voy and GRA-chit.  Laclède and Chouteau are probably spinning in their graves.
---
The most foolish thing I saw in that video was not using the trigger buttons to move the slider!
---
even as a low level, I crafted several before I realized they dont work with PA.
---
I now have a weapon that uses them, I've been seeing them as loot.  IIRC on some super mutants.
---
If you are on PC I think I have several
---
That's unfortunate 
---
Yep. Much better target reg. 
---
i love you for this post.
---
Well said. 
---
I am on X-Box
---
The cave where you do part of the enclave mission to get into the bunker has consistently spawned 2 for me! Part of my gear farming route. 
---
It’s the same pronunciation you oaf. The pronunciation you and I both said are practically the same
---
It probably resets with server going down.
---
Where can one find this helmet?
---
Do you know the name of the location or roughly where it is on the map?
---
Pretty sure there will be various versions.
---
also made the servers horrible with the duping crashing servers right and left
---
Yeahhh I haven’t even launched a nuke yet myself.. check this out, this dude found some nice ones. https://youtu.be/rcCg0_y4Szg
---
You can find it in the Mags like the others.
---
Shes replied to a message ive sent her before but i imagine they get dozens of messages every day from this sub so its a case of trying to filter through them all
---
Zork?  Just an Infocom rehash of the older Colossal Cave game, which was a re-work of the original ADVENT.EXE from the old CP/M days and Mainframe days (I played it first on a PDP-11/70 timeshare system.)
---
But in the meantime, XYZZY!  (if you played Zork, you hopefully knew about that...)
---
hmph. puny human.  so weak. so fragile.
---
I AM THE STRONGEST! STRONGEST SUPER MUTANT!
---
I had to switch to area chat, no one was hearing me when I was on auto. But, only at events do I hear folks chat consistently.
---
Are you on PS4?  I’m happy to help you learn about the game, make you some gear, give you some extra plans AND you can keep your caps.
---
Also your “friend” sucks and you should drop him like a sock full of poo.
---
This event really encourages players to server hop, but I think things will probably improve as the week goes on, the newness wears off, and they start to realize that it's not particularly worthwhile.
---
ok, im kind of starting to like you, i appreciate your style of sarcasm.
---
upvoted for dedication.
---
Abandoned waste dump NE of Harpers ferry. 
---
Yeah I picked one up a week back from a Scorched Beast, you know...cause we all use a Crossbow to take out big baddies! 🤙🏼
---
Would this include redeploying a workshop that was once owned? What happens to the old owners items? Are they scrapped? Deleted? Do they get stored in the old owners budget?
---
My theory is that it is intentional in order to keep the date consistent for new players who are supposed to be leaving the vault on this date. I would rather us all have different dates if that’s the case just so I don’t see the same one forever. 
---
Because I don't have a European account or connection to redeem it on. And I play on the US Server.
---
It's really weird that not one single player has found a rare mask, is this a bug? Someone should ask the Community Managers for an official statement on the matter.
---
Okay but my luck with finding them in magazines is terrible
---
So does the executioner's effect actually help with this? Does it affect the radiation damage or no? I plan to get one later today as a counter to these types of builds. Hopefully I can find a player on PS4 to do some sparring with.
---
Yes, that's a good point!  You'll definitely find multiples in there.
---
Oh ok fair enough but you could just buy a US one 
---
If you’re desperate, Enclave sells them along with fusion cores. 
---
Those are the only ones out at the moment. They may or may not have the other ones later. 
---
Quest markers don't really make it harder though, it just makes it more of a chore. We need less mechanics that feel like chores in this game
---
Go to photo mode by pressing the map button and entering photomode, you can now move around while playing the instrument.
---
I bought one from Phoenix from Watoga.
---
No one has provided proof that the others are obtainable.
---
There is somewhere mentioned when we leave vault? Some guys had bigger hungover. I don't think everybody left vault on same day.
---
This has happened to me several times, replacing or moving the item they were sitting on usually causes them to show up a stored.
---
Thank you kind stranger 
---
If it's black Titanium you're after, I'd suggest running through Blackwater mine and getting your hands on as much mole miner suit scrap as you can, it breaks down into black Titanium.  A lot quicker than deathclaw hunting.
---
There's some food in the various buildings, but right now, there's so many people at the event, not much left for latecomers.
---
Can I be your enemy?
---
I think it was just a test for server stability, as the people who got unbanned ddnt receive any notification...
---
I'm lvl 97, I'm aware of this feature thanks
---
I've never heard anyone either. None of the settings make a difference.
---
You *require* a thesaurus, *ASAP!*
---
That's strange... though, wouldn't the rifle do the job too? I mean that's literally a few points in perception over agility to the same end.
---
\+karma
---
Are you going to the medical Wing specifically as the vendors share caps but have different stock. They are always shown as available to me and I go there daily. 
---
I didn’t even get the progress mark in my challenges to say I’ve killed one, damn doing it with a new Level 8 character I made to play Wild Appalachia with May have been a mistake.
---
As may of deleting my other level 47 characters 
---
Heh. I got kicked out of Montgomery Ward's in the Westroads mall in Omaha, Nebraska for setting the font color and background color both to black on the display VIC 20s using PEEK and POKE statements. RunStop don't do squat to reset that, Mister store clerk!
---
Yeah the rifle has better stats I think lol haven't tested it out though thoroughly 
---
Not sure if you already bought the maps from the one machine in Welch but they take you to the location of some black titanium. It costs around 300 caps but each map can you give you 10-30 black titanium.
---
TY but it is already on the list.
---
On ps4 I have found it about 4 times over at the foward station closest to watago
---
Honestly, I like it just for seeing so many other players in the same spot.  That's about it.
---
I figured it out!
---
if its so illegal as you say, how come bethesda hasnt removed mine and the ability to craft them yet?
---
By why didn't they give a heads up saying that it was a test for stability and we would only be unbanned for a small while
---
As soon as you get the firmware update, the date display error will be fixed, it's a known issue.
---
Take your pipboy to your local tech...oh, wait...
---
Yeah, if I see a place calling itself Vault Hospital, I'm assuming its made by the guy that created the murder church and the deathclaw maze, and I am avoiding the fuck out of it for fear of some crazed clown cleverly murdering me.
---
Wouldn't that be a great experience! Would make workshop ownership so much engaging and valuable. 
---
Always two there are; no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
---
I haven’t because I haven’t been very deep past the savage divide.
---
I haven't had that happen yet. Mostly we goof off with emotes and poses and run around jumping on each other. 
---
Lol. I've stolen a nuke from a group who owned a workshop on PC last week. Killed them in the last room. Was it you?  
---
Just asked in their dev stream apparently all are available they're just rare 
---
The PA chassis system is so bad. I don't have any idea how to help you, I just wanted to reiterate how bad the system is. 
---
Aha. Thank you. This did it. Unfortunately....one of my  two turret spots was on the ground. Sigh. 
---
You on pc? 
---
I ran 7-8, no disconnects, very little if any rubber banding.  I did have to wait almost 5 minutes for everything to load in by the end though, which was off because the number of people running it had dwindled quite a bit by then.
---
That was relatively early in the day though (I'm on east coast time).
---
&gt;  even speaking to people who have been to Helvetia call it that
---
I am a person who's been to Helvetia and I don't call it that :-)
---
I'm just gonna muddy the waters here.  Here's video of a former Helvetia resident pronouncing it "Hell-vish-uh."  https://youtu.be/w99XgXAwqxw?t=74  Maybe he's saying "Hell-vish-yuh," it's a little hard to make out.  But definitely three syllables, not four.  
---
Me too. Checked every vendor and cant find the plans. 
---
I was shocked at how well it went! There was about 20 of us. I'm level 20 and everyone was 90+.  I heard beeping at one point... I'm like that sounds  like a suicider from FO4 as I have yet to see one in 76. I turn around and some CHAMPION one shot killed him within like 1 foot of me. I would have been dust without that guy.
---
I was able to get a shot on the sloth but the loot was ok. Last thing before I jumped back to base was some dude running by naked.
---
Did the event about ten times. Once we only had 3 robots survive and same exact rewards. 
---
We nuked it last night. (Well a friend of mine did while the rest of us were doing the event)
---
Server disconnects. Then it throws you from the main menu back to the same server. Nuke isnt there but the flora is. 
---
The event remembered where it was and we were able to complete it. 
---
I haven't had "misses" per say, (I kill them just as quickly) but the hit animation/ audio feedback sometimes doesn't display.
---
That is, on high level enemies, Within any given fight, I'll occasionally see the health meter drop, but no squish sound, blood spray, etc.
---
For low level enemies, sometimes I'll swing, they insta-die, but without the blood spray, etc.
---
Oops (I assume that was in response to me). Only thing that could make it better would be more proximity to vendors. By way of apology, here's my second favorite CAMPsite, great for level 15-25 if you start a new character: [https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1063](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1063) Put your CAMP on the hill behind the middle cabin.  
---
Raider power armor, magazine, recipe, and mid-level plan spawn, cap stash, multiple mods and ammo boxes, three dressed radstags, and tons of yao guai and radscorpions just begging to be lured into your turrets. One shot into each with the crossbow from one of the cabins and your turrets do the rest of the work. Within 7 caps' fast travel of all vendor factions but responders, and those you can get to via Vault 76.
---
...um.... who is this and why is everyone happy to meet him?
---
No one has killed you for just sitting there? Or are you hiding?
---
Their scrap also contains gears, so OP can kill 2 birds with one stone.
---
I agree w/Pedro. Been here since the beginning, suffered all the problems, still love the game.
---
   Don't feel stupid or nieve. Your experience is your's. I'm glad it's been good. Spread the word.
---
Yep, just like every other Event, if you even in the area you get rewards. 
---
Sameeee! My friend that was farming with me only gets giant masks for some reason. He’s livid. 
---
I suspect the Re-Banning is due to the fact that people have found a way to get stuff off of their Duping Mules without having to destroy it.
---
The latest patch created a scenario that required items to be destroyed rather than dropped which would have removed the excess (Duped) Items from the game, but players are not destroying the items, and have discovered a way to retrieve them instead. 
---
it's proof this is just a simulation and it's all happening inside a pod.
---
Ran 4 last night with no disconnects. Did't really have any issues at all near the event and that was with 10-15 players at the event each time.
---
Noice
---
I ran it 6 times and everyone was showing off masks or being goody when it was done.  I just don't engage people if they act like jackasses.
---
I've run it a bunch and regardless of how many bots survive the rewards are the same. 
---
Got the sausage plans, requires intestines and spoiled meat.
---
You can get colors for excavator armor??
---
A wandering vendor, and he’s not super common to find 
---
I find that hard to believe. Bethesda would never release something that was buggy, and not tested properly...
---
Tbh I’m honestly not sure if it affects the rad damage or not but it definitely seems like it when I use it against a bloodied build. Probably needs to be tested.
---
TY I was able to find it this time. I added it to the list.
---
PS4  I lag a lot entering the event.  It's okay after that.
---
HA HA!
---
PS4 :(
---
Hiding. On top of the church by the old man winter effigy, crouching with chameleon armor on 
---
It’s a great game. They fixed so many bugs and added so many balance fixes.
---
I tried RP’ing in Fo76 but for an hour didnt see anyone and then was called a duper by some random people and shot.
---
What else can i do for fun in fo76?
---
I praise this post for all it is worth. This makes me understand the older guy who I just meet and maybe get me to understand why he does some of the things he does. Appreciate this post a lot. 
---
Wait, what happens right *now* if you capture someone's workshop? I don't think I've ever actually done it, I just assumed all the stuff they built would vanish.
---
Death claw island in the first, it’s a island that’s north of the moth man museum 
---
The launch being awful was exaggerated a great deal. I've been playing since the Beta and haven't had nearly as many issues that have been described or reviewed. 
---
Makes me glad a PvP format is coming, hope every PvP player goes there to play. I'm sick of being farmed for caps while trying to enjoy the game.
---
Also nuked Flora decays into inert flux- which weighs less than boiled water and decreases more thirst.
---
Raider is lvl 15 I think
---
I have one I'm lined up to get tonight. If I make any findings I'll make a post on them. I would assume it only affects the marginal ballistic damage it does normally which may be significant when they are down to 5 hp after getting so many rads. 
---
The game was never as bad as everyone said it was when it launched.
---
oh, well a heads up, Fort Defiance is a gold mine. in addition to the foil hats, you can find straight jackets (weigh .1 and sell to vendors for ~40 caps), lots of plastic (enamel buckets, an area of dog bowls, and plasticwear and plates on top level), several military ammo bags (ballistic fiber) and the original "Fasnacht Man Mask."
---
Interesting I guess people really don't want to get over their items I guess
---
Even outside of the glitches, it was reviewed as having some of the worst gameplay, missions, and general playability of a game in a long time. 
---
You won’t have enough raw damage.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f9225f8&amp;d=s52ss2si2se2sj2ak2al2pd2pk2pl2l71lv2el0a04cj1i44a70ad2lu2ep0&amp;w=ic4&amp;n=
---
This might be a little better.
---
You have one free point in this build. Dropped the crit focus.
---
If you wanted to run a crit build that would be different, you wouldn’t be able to run melee/pistol/crit:not enough points to do enough dmg.
---
This build focuses on raw dmg for melee and non auto pistols which seems to be you’re focus. The free point is in endurance. You could also get rid of the action girl/boy card in agi, but I find it useful.
---
You’re build just won’t output enough dps, even with crits.
---
I'm not going to use it because its' a repulsive, exploitative mechanic.  It's a well known issue with free to play games, and I've _never_ seen one where the skins are as stupidly expensive as they are here. 
---
The issue isn't people like you and me with willpower. The issue are the people who don't actually have the disposable income who will have impulse control issues and buy the garbage anyway. 
---
Plus, if this shit was FAIRLY priced, they'd get a lot more sales over-all. They won't get a fucking extra dime from me _because_ of this exploitative, insane system. 
---
I honestly don't understand what's wrong with people who can defend this exploitative bullshit. 
---
I did 3 parades yesterday and I haven't seen this. I've mostly seen players posing for pics or popping balloons...... Which is oddly kind of fun
---
After the event... I attack everyone.  Usually a few people are down to clown. Buzzblade buzz buzz!
---
If anyone is upset about getting slapped after an event. They are being ridiculous.
---
In soviet russia, COW MILKS YOU!
---
And again, theres nothing coming down the pipe that other publishers woulden't have put out for free _anyway_. The people dropping money on the over-priced cosmetics shit aren't just whales, it's also poor people with impulse control issues. THATS the godamn problem. 
---
I'm 53. My wife has decided that gaming is a lot better than some of the things I could be doing. 😈 Mostly ignores my game time now ☺
---
Hi 53, I'm dad!
---
This is so cool! This is pretty much the kind of shit Bethesda had in mind for this game. 
---
It all comes down to making your own opinion. Play a game and decide if you like it. Never listen to critics and/or internet troll-sheep. Just because other people say something is good or bad doesn't mean you won't feel differently. Try it yourself &amp; then make an educated experience based opinion of your own...
---
Sorry didn't mean to sound patronizing if it came off that way, just realized I only read the first part of your post before I was like "Photoshop mode!". Forgive me? :3
---
Lol okay bro, that’s even part of what we were talking about. Trust me I know how to play the game so don’t need your synopsis. Even with doing everything you mentioned if someone’s got a TS double barrel with decent legendaries and the other guys got an AAE with full Ass/sent like I do, they’re gonna lose every time. 
---
I’m not even sure what point you’re trying to prove, we’re talking about PvP here, no ones using wooden swords, but some people are using god tier stuff. You can’t kill a god unless you’re also a god or get real lucky. 
---
i thought it was weird that Brahmian only had one, long udder
---
Ba2 file names should be separated by a trailing comma and a single space using notepad.  Don’t concern yourself with how notepad truncates any entry.  If you separate the groups of entries, then there should be a blank line before each “sResourceArchiveList2”, but on my system I took the additional line out and everything still works.
---
I gotta get over there eventually I just need to be better prepared. Thanks for the tip though.
---
It's a fantastic game and i love playing it, i play almost every day.
---
But a lot of people hated it at launch and still hate it now.  They don't like the main concepts, the implementation, the multiplayer, the combat or the weight limits.
---
This is not a game for everyone.  You have to invest a little of your time into understanding the world, and for many who do that, the game becomes excellent. 
---
How I feel
---
Yes - check WV Lumber Company in the NW. Low level super mutants.
---
Boppity boopity?
---
Everyone has the set? uh no they don't.
---
no rush my man! best way to play is to go your own pace.
---
The wasteland isn’t supposed to be fair I’m sorry
---
Hey I just asked the devs on steam and all masks are in game just some are rare, when I staid I'd done the event 40 times and only gotten commons they said that I guess you have to do it 40 more times so fuck me I guess

I was one of the original people building community camps out of workshops... people ruined it about 2 weeks after launch. In game i played Nuka Girl. I always left a ton of nuka inspired camps, fully operational, defended, with access to pure water as well usually.   
---
Guitar, Piano, bunk house with beds... aaaaand then the douchebags exploited their way to level 21035923649568 and began hunting me down for my caps, destroying my shit, not capturing it and harassing me until i switched servers.   
---
I believe the phrase is "this is why douchebags fuck up nice things because they're fucking CUNTS" or... something like that. 
---
This one? [https://i.imgur.com/u8rnpYn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u8rnpYn.jpg)
---
I've not really had that problem in the game.  Ever.  I'm kind of surprised you have had so much of an issue with that.  
---
Thanks a lot bro! People like you are what are keeping people in this game. 
---
Im interested!!!
---
Moonshiner's Shack's chem station has been replaced with a brewing station.  A new vault door has been added NW of the map, about an inch on the map north of Aaronholt's Homestead.  One of the terminals at Enclave Bunker's military wing gives an access code to unlock the keypad in a shack near Tanagra Town (thus indicating that all the corpses in that shack were probably Enclave people).  Some of the plants have their appearances changed, such as firecracker berries (more red) and some of the nuke flora.  Also, the spoilage rate of food and drinks has been accelerated if you fast travel (possibly a bug).  An exploitable "campfire trick" in CAMP-building has been removed, so now you can't put water purifiers on top on campfires like some have done, and you can't build pyramid structures like this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab-BEWdlKfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab-BEWdlKfQ).  These are all the undocumented features of the patch that I have noticed.
---
Same goes for me for name and back at ya
---
Let me know what you figured put and thank you very much for the build it may be just my cup of tea.
---
Someone said the road map visually teased five stars but I'm not putting any eggs in that basket until I'm sitting in a vault raid looking at a goddamn Kneecapping Incinerating quad limb cripple +1 strength lead pipe
---
I’m talking about dlc not atomic store stuff, don’t misconstrue my argument. Like PvP servers as one example, that should’ve been in the game from the start. It’s all good tho, I’ve paid my $60 and I’ll let the whales spend more money if BGS really needs more money to release quality content.
---
Would you trade it? 
---
this does not work..the gauge starts ticking immediately..think about when you find a meat pile and there is spoiled meat in there..because no one picked it up..id suggest max out the good with salt perk..it could take days before things spoil..this only works with the items on you tho..anything u put in your stash will go bad quickly
---
Very very nice. The angles are impressive
---
See some were adults some were teenagers or 18 or so. None with high pitch voices most of the little kids thought it was amazing or bad a$$ lol
---
And yet people with 600+ hours of game play are still playing.
---
Try going into 3rd person, enter the instrument and then try photomode
---
You sir a a genius and a Madman I'm so doing this before I leave for work tomorrow
---
I think this one was already reported. It was not on the list as I went to bed but I just added it. Thanks for that.
---
I was having a lot of trouble with this a few days back, but yesterday all the robots were landing back in the same spot they were killed in, and there seems to be a small delay now as well.
---
Also if using Fireproof, I was only getting crippled, but survived all the instant launch explosions, I always kill them with my DC Gauntlet, (Ammo conservation).
---
Evert single person in my group has one and most of their friends have one. Uh yes they do.
---
So im lvl 8 and have leather gear and a hunting rifle, am i bad at this game? What should i do. Ive just been wandering collecting upgrading and killing so far. 
---
You couldn't do it pre-patch, it was always missing in the player windows, R3 turns into offers. You could only check them in vendor windows. Though hopefully when they fix this bug they will implement that!
---
I’m not talking about cosmetic stuff I’m talking about a legitimate DLC, obviously that’s been a part of every game it would be stupid to complain about that. I’m talking about the game model of purchasing atoms to fund future dlc. Personally I’d rather pay $20 for an incredible DLC. 
---
Apparently so do 450+ other people.
---
I just found one yesterday at the trainyard in Morgantown.
---
This weeks set is especially annoying. It's forcing you to wear a beer hat during a timed event where there are neat new bits of headgear, DURING THE FUCKING EVENT where you should be showing off neat new bits of headgear. 
---
I'm not going to wear a fucking beer hat while killing squirrels, you stupid fucking assholes. 
---
Drink 50 alcohol in a day? I mean sure, if you have two hours of playtime to run around and swap shit out at fermenters it's not "hard" but it's a massive fucking time sink for basically zero reward. 
---
I run this build but never pvp
---
And the most important. You can now milk brahmin.
---
It literally plays like Fallout 4 minus conversations.

Xbox one.  It happened to me too.   Luckily, i was there til the end.

This is a very min/maxed crit/riflebuild have virtually zero qol perks. But will output massive dmg.
---
That would be great, image if you could double dip and get a two shot two shot weapon and make it four shot.
---
For sure. I got 2. Add me: EggrFegegr.
---
This may get back lash but if this is added it should be able to be destroyed in the air and take flux to fuel. I don't mean like flux each use but it should be like filling up a gas tank. You can sit on a tank of it for a while but need to refill it every 5-10 rides or have it distance based, so when yo fill it up you get 100 caps worth of transport or more idk
---
Great, I always have a ton of spoiled meat.
---
Im online now, add MrGlayden
---
Happened to me as well.
---
I knew you could in vendor windows, I thought I did it with player trading too, must have been mistaken.  Really hope they address this ASAP
---
Also you should delete this as people will pvp you just to be a dick
---
What... I've definitely tried this before. You sure it's recording the in-game chat and not party chat? I'll be over the moon if it actually records the in-game voice chat.
---
Want the recipe for it? 
---
Oh man some weapons would get to be nerfed TWICE
---
Thanks! Resolved for french.
---
Iam starting my PC right now
---
nope, all the stuff they built, you inherit
---
To my mind, its's bullshit that they expect you to run around in a beer hat, in an event which puts out shiny new hats. The person who made that decision is a fucking asshole. 
---
Yeah, I've done tons of Charleston sever jumps and wasn't getting the bot to spawn, so when he shows up with his brahmin in tow I was plesently surprised to find the coat.
---
I almost always travel to “Events”, and sit on the sidelines, but act only if a lower level gets in trouble so as to not deprive them of their hard earned loot.  Several times I have shown up at the very end due to way the game plays, but the intention is too actually help.  I now have a few lower levels who “know” me and will emote when they want help.  And going against the trend, I do announce my intentions via mic and always get a appropriate emote back.
---
Yeah I agree with you, but I have noticed a little uptick in difficulty do I see where the OP is coming from. Seems they’re encouraging engaging with the community more and trading to accomplish your goals.
---
Yeah I was going to say that if you were on Xbox that we'd be more than happy to group up on chat to answer any questions you might have.
---
There's probably like minded people on PC that are more than happy to do the same. 
---
No, *one* way to solve it is to nerf resources.
---
Another is the bidding system mentioned above
---
Another is a simple time limit.
---
Another is to escalate the NPC attacks in difficulty and/or frequency to the point where holding the workshop is extremely difficult.
---
Another is to let other players supply resources and/or caps to boost NPC attacks, to the point where the mobs can obliterate anything.
---
Raider armor starts at L15 and goes up from there.
---
( I recently dumped a raider helmet L40)
---
I heard Roses quest (which I havent finished) will award a full raider set
---
But may take you to areas of the map which you may not be quite ready.
---
That aside, you'll hit the minimum levels for T45 and 51 before you know it.
---
Make the rounds of the many armor spawn points on the left side of the map - you'll have more cores and armor parts than you know what to do with.
---
IIRC, the batteries included perk which reduces the weight of cores to 0.3
---
By the time I collected a full set of raider 15, I was already in T45 L30, and didn't use that long before I graduated to T51/35.  Am missing one part for T60/40, and am paitiently working on leveling to build excavator 45.
---
If you fast travel to the sons of Dane compound, just through the front gate is a guard tower on the left, just underneath it is a magazine spawn. Server hopping there will bet you a bunch of magazines if you try long enough.
---
I used to build up tons of fortifications for workshops, but i found the more i did, the more it seemed those workshops would be contested, its like a psychological thing that people want to take them over more if they see they whole place developed
---
now when i take them over, i even try to hide anything i build (other than traps/turrets) like stash box, cooking/crafting stations
---
How is trying to see if anyone wants to PvP being a jackass? 
---
It's just a lil SLAP. 👏👏🙌
---
$14 in the ATOM Shop for that paint scheme.
---
They aren't that hard to find.
---
Go to Sugar Grove and the facilities around it and you'll find plenty of Typewriters, Desk Fans, Battered Clipboards, and Globes which contain these things.  A few Typewriters can also be round at the Charleston Herald.
---
Was wondering what this was. How do you get it? Event reward?
---
Oh great! What a reasonable price!
---
New game modes, raids and lots more quests. That sounds quite substantial to me certainly seems within the remit of paid DLC from other publishers.
---
&gt;  it's also poor people with impulse control issues. THATS the godamn problem. 
---
I'd agree with you on that point if Bethesda were selling lootboxes which they aren't. 
---
Why kill a yellow eye, they are not hostile. 
---
I don't agree that there needs to be a way to kill someone "not into it", I mean... it's a game. If someone isn't into it, it seems to me the classy thing to do is find someone else to play with... possible spoils of war, or no. 
---
Now, that said, I've turned on harassers a couple times, and pounded them to pulp, just to prove a point. But then I stand guard over their crap, and let them come get it. It's all such a pointless exercise with me, that the payout and rewards would be greater for both of us if you'd just... go do your thing and let me do mine.
---

Last it was seen probably.
---
Or break just as you fire them 😉
---
That makes one of you. I'm glad I haven't run into THIS form of stupidity yet...the fucking asshole who launched a nuke was bad enough. 
---
Why do you asshats have to fucking destroy everything? 
---
Where is it?  How do I get there?  Is there a level requirement?
---
Yeah np, I know a couple more but I’ve gotta save some spots for myself to combat all the server hoppers this guide will create. It’s a great idea tho and I commend you for putting the effort in.
---
for the high metal parts (i don't build since december maybe they change it with updates) you need to put first a wall, then the metal parts, connect the roof, and then quit the walls.
---
so much of building in f76 is about finding what thing goes first and chain them with the correct one, so maybe what you try to build isn't impossible but just not in the correct order xd
---
Ok. Normally I just trade stuff for nothing, but I don't have that recipe.
---
So now you can craft ultracite bolts? 
---
Survival servers, pvp servers, and pve servers should totally be things, but I don't think they're using Atom funds to make those. 
---
As for end game stuff, it's a mmo, it has to have new content rolling out often enough to make people keep wanting to play. Forcing everyone to pay $20 to be able to play each new update would probably kill the game. It's not "good" enough to warrant potentially hundreds of dollars. If they actually make new DLC every few months, this game could go for years. When they stop putting out new content, people will eventually get bored. 
---
I saw a lvl 15 with a full set of raider PA the other day, hell at lvl 15 i was still using pipe weapons heheh
---
I guess youre right, but hopefuly thats not the case. Also suppressor bloodied berzerker sounds awesome.
---
Same here, will purchase Atoms when i feel they deserve the reward for a patch/update. Otherwise I just grind challenges, which are running out fast.
---
If you can't find one, and are on PS4, I can come build one for you.
---
With the scrounger perk in the trash cans around Whitesprings
---
Perfect! Thanks man. Once I finish my church I'm going to do a proper tour. 
---
Because it’s a wasteland. Because it’s a fallout game. Because it’s fun. 
---
No idea, I don't think I have even ever looked at the ultricite ammo tab.
---
he would be happier building new things than trying to rebuild something that he already did
---
Well, No one had a list going and I needed this list to farm them for my self. I am always willing to pay 30c for them. 
---
I got it on my first. Also in place of a plan.
---
Sadly I'm on PC. I've been told I can find it on raider vendors so I'm just going to search there.
---
I know im heading to Sugar grove as we speak i just have a surplus of canned and packaged food for low level players or for someone to stock up
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen them from time to time at Raider vendors (which makes sense).
---
i agree at the very least they could have sent you some kind of message about it all
---
i did notice  a huge decrease in server stability the day people all posted they were unbanned
---
So glad I hoarded some dog food. Mmm.
---
Survival isn't much of a new game mode. It's the same map, it's the same content, they adjusted specific parameters. It's a mild change that most companies would release for free anyway. The "raids" sound like one or two small dungeon runs. 
---
The quests that have been hinted as coming at the very end of this MIGHT qualify as "actual DLC" for any normal publisher, but I don't have any actual data on that. 
---
And..."You have one-two days to be able to buy this super rare paint job for about $20 real world dollars, and then it disappears again, possibly forever" Is manipulative and evil as fuck. 
---
Yesterday I ran the event 10 times and got disconnected 4 times right at the end. For me it seems if I stay back from the crowd at the bonfire I'm okay... each time I got disconnected I was with the group around the fire...
---
Oh, and on the odd occasion, after doing the mine, there can be a random spawned Deathclaw in the power plant between the mine and Whitesprings station. 
---
Check, make a picture and share 👍
---
1) So? 2) Fallout games haven't ever had PVP 3) It really fucking isn't. 
---
A few slaps, nah.  20+ is jackass material LOL
---
It is a lot of fun, I never felt it was as bad as many made it out to be, tbh it is shaping up to be my favorite fallout and I have played them all.
---
Their stuff stays and you become the owner. This will include items built and them leaving the server. Those previously built items stay in the world and you become the new owner with those in your budget.
---
i put the owl mask but then i realize i was oos real quick without my helmet i was over-encumbered lmao
---
I'm 38, so not as old, but I uhhh feel old..  I've seen a few griefers and usually just ignore or switch servers.  Anyways, I really wish Bethesda had a "turn your mic on" emote.
---
i always meant to ask this
---
what system? if xbox I have plenty extra
---
Raider armor, go to clarksburg shooting range, then look to your left there's a 3 story red building, it can spawn on the 3rd floor. they'll be a few low level enemies, and a boss on 3rd floor.
---
I was never banned, and never involved in Duping, but do have a Character that was once my only Vendor Character, the first "Weight Limit" change made it so that Character could no longer trade, but only drop stuff, but the latest change made it so that was no longer an option.
---
I did however find a way to get stuff off the old character without destroying it, and hopefully it will continue to work, as everything he is carrying was legit crafted &amp; gathered.
---
It's sad that the Dupers caused so much harm to the game for everyone, and some continue despite all efforts.
---
charleston capitol building
---
Blueprints in workshops do work, but just bearly, sometimes the resource generator is biggest and so it doesn’t actually place in the right place and doesn’t work with the blueprint. 
---
Often I would just blueprint around 1 or 2 resources and then fill in the rest once I built, and the blueprint contains the power generator and the power lines and a basic base.  
---
It can also crash the UI, this happened to me at the nuclear waste dump multiple times 
---
That's correct. Raiders vendors. I got mine from the Top of the World station. They're not always in stock.
---
Chill my friend. Just ignore him why would you act like him? You will gain nothing from spending that precious time on him instead of farming some legendary lead pipes, wooden armor or the mysterious drill. The Unholy Drill. You can modify it so you can drill supermutants or deathclaws on to walls. 
---
That's the way I see it.  They could barely balance 3\*.  5\*, unless you're introducing some new minor effects that play nice together, are just asking for trouble.
---
I don't know about most people but the only reason increasing the frequency of NPCs would be harder is because I would get bored and or annoyed one shotting all the mobs constantly.
---
I doubt they'll add in a system where players could "buy" waves and on top of which it would go back to the whole "griefing" thing you guys want stopped.
---
A time limit I suppose could work but it would defeat the original purpose Bethesda intended and that was to have a relatively easy but dangerous resource farm. If you could only hold it for an hour it would end up being more annoying any how then any griefing would be.
---
You can actually build a wood extractor on certain locations where there's logs similar to lead deposits etc. You just need to find them and move you're camp there. I doubt Bethesda will add another means to get wood, there's plenty of it in game already. 
---
i think you replied to the wrong person, but im sure people will figure it out as we both said the same thing :)
---
Ha! A four shot missile launcher with quad barrels would be a thing to see if you could!
---
Agree to disagree. 
---
How did those 20+ SLAPS effect you? Did you need to... Drink water to regain the 10 health you lost? Did you have to run away to a safe space and cry?
---
I get that but still if you get atleast 8 per those days (server hop) you have a good chance at getting what you want. Also, it seems like they restrict the types of masks you will get per day so try and get on as much as possible.
---
That's an interesting one. Might have to give that a shot at some point. Thanks!
---
I miss the campfire stacking trick...my base is still not quite right, and when I move I'll loose it forever, never to be made perfectly symmetrical. 
---
I like that side view pic!
---
I mean I get what youre saying but I think a great dlc would give players another 200 hours of gameplay. I know that’s not what was advertised so they can never do it but I think it would hold the devs more accountable to releasing quality content rather than just a slow stream of nice additions to the game, albeit some that feel like they should’ve been there from the start. At this point I think the atomic shop funds are paying for a lot of the development so idk where the cutoff begins.
---
Anyways I agree with your assessment it’s really just wishful thinking on my part. Like I said i refuse to pay for atoms until I see quality content be released, the parade is nice and all but it’s just another event that takes me 10 minutes and not a quality dlc. We’ll see what the summer holds tho I think there could be a lot of cool things coming.
---
Yep. Check the Atomic Shop! 
---
I have been experiencing the VATs issue occasionally, I use a DC Gauntlet as my primary weapon, and sometimes VATs won't let you swing with an enemy right in front of you.

It's say Napoleon Mask.
---
Is this trouble still with the good with salt perk? Or just another method without that perk.
---
The problem with the 3s are the fact they just took most Fallout 4 effects and didn't change them except for the racial effects. I really think these will be a bit better and more than likely bigger effects because you can't really go down a step past "aim speed while moving"
---
You god *lied to.* If you enjoyed FO4's gameplay it was what you got. I've been playing since release and never experienced any of the problems folks complained about. I think you just got duped by a vocal minority.
---
And shop items.
---
I’m sure I’ll find more because of the guide so thanks for putting the time in!
---
Brilliant dude.

Stop the presses!

THIS GUY DOESN'T LIKE PVP!!
---
#NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO PVP ANYMORE!
---
hmm im not sure as ive been unable to actually try it ^^;
---
my thoughts exactly.
---
Could you imagine if Bethesda put on an event in Helvetia during their Fasnacht festival next year, the turnout would likely be record breaking.
---
Just FYI some games do actually do this. Black Desert Online will detect cheat engine specifically if it's running in the background. Left it on after I was using it on a single player game and it gave me a notification and closed to desktop.
---
Team up, run around. Get mutated. 
---
I'll probably be on around 4:00 central time or 5:00 eastern time
---
I've had a similar experience - you seem to get a mask and a plan regardless of your overall input.
---
Glad I've been saying it correctly in my head 🤣
---
Very true, we can only hope bgs listens for the next one I guess.
---
Nope.  I don't care at all. Mostly just laugh at people.   Btw, your troll attempts are misguided.  
---
Real life players make up the lack of human NPCs and it you’ve ever played a fallout game you should know very well that *RAIDERS, GUNNERS, BANDITS, CANNIBALS, BASICALLY ANY HUMAN* are basically hostile. This is fallout, a mature rated game based around the genocide of millions of innocents in total atomic annihilation. A little PvP isn’t terrible. You win some, you lose some. What it sounds like to me is that you always lose some. I’m sorry to say but tough shit. It can’t always be sunshine’s and rainbows in the wasteland! It’s more Nukashine and rad roaches!
---
I completely agree, but I'm not going to spam E or space bar 200 times to craft or collect water. Things like this are basic quality of life features.
---
The issue is, inevitably, no one just does PVP shit with people who want to do PVP shit. 
---
This is half the server in one spot and one or two random shit-heals trying to murder everyone else. 
---
Not gunfire from me, the random loud gunshots you would hear in the world during the beta/launch.
---
Haha yeah and it'll cost you way more wood~
---
Makes me want a super mutant mask. Or even a Chally mask.
---
That's the run I do for it, canned coffee and canned dog food are the staples of my FO76 diet.
---
But it’s wrong? Food continues to spoil if it’s in a bag or still on a corpse 
---
Cathedral. 
---
Multiple mole miners at the mine by whitesprings station, more at the mine camp and surrounding condos near top of the world.  
---
Also a couple underground at the mining HQ where you got the excavator quest.
---
Got those, did the exterior of the WS mine twice, the interior once, then top of the world camp and associated mine once.  Picked of 8 more during a WS nuke.  Now have all the titanium needed for excavator 45...now I ust have to get to L45 :)
---
Getting the required number of screws for the armor is more tedious than the titanium.
---
T45 is what you’re looking for. You can find it just need to search power armour spawn spots. Some spots lower armour than others.
---
Rc
---
Oh, never knew that, thanks for the pronouncation.
---
I'll have to look in there, but could it be that the shelf is just facing the wrong way?
---
I agree survival isn't very much. We also have Nuclear winter coming and wastelanders all this within the next 100 days! So we'll have to see what all that entails. 
---
&gt; "You have one-two days to be able to buy this super rare paint job for about $20 real world dollars, and then it disappears again, possibly forever" Is manipulative and evil as fuck. 
---
"Manipulative" I agree with you there. "Evil as fuck" not so much. It's just the same as any "when it's gone, it's gone" deal you find at any store/supermarket. 
---
Maybe trying teaming up. Having a few friends to push you along, or vice versa, can really change the pace for you. Otherwise, keep following your waypoints and kill a lot of enemies!! 
---
Yes.  
---
I server hopped and just got in the event as it was completed. I got rewards and got lucky. Then hopped again.  
---
Can you confirm the spelling on shit-heals? 
---
Im writing a letter to Todd on your behalf
---
Name checks out lol
---
That’s a bummer but at least you got some cool weapons, I was in the opposite situation for a while, good armor not so good weapons for my build. Then I found the trading subreddit and got the gear I needed. 
---
I definitely think there’s some truth to the character seeding but I’m not diligent enough to spreadsheet out all my drops and see. 
---
 My first parade experience devolved into a 5 or 6 way fist fight shit show which further devolved into orbital strike nuka grenade pandemonium. Still fun. But a bit different than yours. 
---
Well, others say it's "free" if you play the "right" way, so there's always that.
---
'cause despite the fact it shouldnt have been hostile, that one aggro'd on us. So we killed it. 
---
It is located in Helvetia. The image [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Helvetia?file=Helvetia_map.png) shows where it is on the map. There is also no level requirement! It might take a few minutes of waiting for the event to start however. It seems to be ever 30-45 minutes or so that an event will start.
---
I don't think those unconfirmed masks are being given by the event, at least not yet. I've been server hopping and have 3-4 copies of each of the common ones already 
---
 Why would you pay any attention to these assholes? It was pure bullshit, and you gobbled it down. ;(
---
Ahaha. If you're on Xbox and have the materials needed, I can craft Calibrated Shocks for Excavator. It'll restore that 100 carry weight while you wear a mask and be a total of +200 when wearing the helmet!
---
yup, even bigger turnouts then the SBQ fights, had almost the entire server in all the events I did yesterday. Maybe 2-4 players didn't attend.
---
At least one person agrees with me
---
I was gilded 2x and platinum 1x since yesterday on this sub.
---
What is reddit platinum? Do you know? Can i gave it to someone else now? How does it work. 
---
Also understand that the people left here, are the ones who enjoy the game. 
---
/u/Ladydevann, could we possibly get some confirmation regarding the other five masks? Bugged, less than a 0.001% chance, waiting for the latter half of the week or what?
---
Just stop tracking your quests, that removes the marker.
---
...Now i want a giant amored hamster ball to crush things in.

I remember that there were also a few rebels who had a circular slide rule.  Never owned one of those myself.

Largely by people whose income relies on getting eyes on their videos.  Sensationalism sells.

Try it. Maybe you'll like it.  Maybe you'll hate it.  It's not *objectively* bad.

 At wade airport there's a semi trailer thats got a level 2 lock on it but always spawns raider power armor in it. 
---

---
Pipe wrench reduces power armor repair cost
---
Did this earlier today, all robots survived and I didn’t get a mask 
---
That argument was fucking moronic when bethesda made it, it's no better now.  In fallout games, raiders, gunners, bandits, etc, are all on a similar level/set of experience with you (or can be avoided by not going where the higher level ones are). In this game, the level 200 griefer sack of shit shows up at your level 15 event. 
---
And yes, when I "play the game and use loot I find" and the PVP crowd are always the "duping griefers buying god-tier items and targeting people 1/3'd their level" I'd say my experiences with PVP in this game have been pretty shitty. As I've gotten higher in level, my ability to dish out damage has increased, my desire to deal with the toxic sacks of shit who are the vast majority of the "PVP" element of this game have not. 
---
The "anti-grifing" measures that "prevent" non-pvp players from being murdered aren't worth a damn in my experience. So people being excited about PVP at events which are designed for low level characters dcoesn't exactly fill me with fucking glee. 
---
that is so weird! My buddy and I are playing on the US version and our game says "witch" and "giant mask". I wonder why they would do that?
---
I mean griefing doesn’t really bother me, it’s the duping that ruins it but I see your points. Private servers will be an awesome thing i believe. Let the modders fix the bugs and improve upon certain game mechanics.
---
If you learn the plan, sure. My bloodied melee buddy used them for a while. We used to pick them off the scorchbeast corpses and hand them back to him.
---
Cute. 
---
37 here, planning to be part of the first retirement community that plays a lot of games. Looks like you beat me too it, but I'd happily play with you.
---
I used to play world of Warcraft with my dad and his wife. He sucks at doing the instances, but was always on the grind. I always tanked for him. We had fun even tho he was "slow". 
---
Currently I'm trying to get my 9 year old son into it. He loves the game, but he sucks. Lol. I get it takes years of playing to get to my level. I stared gaming in 1985, on the NES. He just can't be there yet. Lol. 
---
We are on PSN, if you ever want to play together. Be happy to help you with your nuke run. Butt_ermybr3ad is my gamer id.
---
I’m assuming you know this but by the context of your comment you hint otherwise. You get new limited time masks for completing the event, new limited time plans and recipes too.
---
You on xb1? I have one, executioner's I believe, I'll give ya
---
Cool! 
---
Im gonna throw an orbital strike grenade in the middle of everyone next time right as the parade ends 
---
I don't think it was ever as bad as people made it out to be. But yes, it's better.
---
Lead and Steel I craft ammo until their bulks drop down to 20 lead 25 steel or to burn down excess gunpowder. Got Demo Perk card up to 5 stars so I've been using circuitry and nuclear material to make nuke mines since they're the bane of the existance for bloodied builds. When i have excess sugar I'll knock down excess Acid to make lemonade.
---
I bulk everything and sell in excess of 11 bulk unless it's Adhesive, Plastic (used for bulking), Gears, Springs, Aluminum which I sell in excess of 51 bulk. For the items that do not bulk, I sell in excess of 110, exception being screws and ballistic fiber which I will set a cap of 510. (I try to buy bulks up to 11 from vendors for items that do not bulk)
---
Hardened mass, Glowing Mass, High Radiation Fluid I set a cap of 20 in reserve. 
---
Doesn't seem to. 
---
Maybe. Seems like all the shelves in that house are like that. 
---
I really can't agree with you at all there. Maybe you don't have the compulsive hoarding issues that I do, so you can't talk to how fucking frustrating it is to have to resist the temptation to throw a hundred bucks at this game to be able to buy neat shit as it comes along. 
---
Ronald, stahhhhhhpppp

This happens whenever I try to snap a shot while sitting in a chair. There could be nothing else around except a single chair and it still says "no room for your camera."
---
Thanks for the trade!
---
The point is more to show that you aren’t supposed to separate the T from the ia. We are merely getting into. A pointless argument and are proving each other’s main point that the “-tia” should be pronounced “shia” and not “tee-ah” as I’ve heard many many people pronounce it
---
Alright cool. I don't get off work until 4 EST so that works well.
---
I am on Xbox and I will absolutely take you up on that offer! GT: DingBingus. I'll be at that event tonight. 
---
Unsure if everyone feels the same way. Some folks are super fun to shadow... you can see the, turning around every so often, looking to see if I'm still there.  They'll try and circle around behind me to catch me, and some do. When they do, I usually emote "fear" and then drop a loot bag... bubblegum, a teddy bear, some snack cakes, a human femur, a baby rattle... and then run away.
---
Others... they just book it away from me as far and fast as they can. Not sure if I'm creeping them out, or if they just don't wanna be bothered. 
---
My CAMP is the smallest most ramshackle looking 2 x 1 construction I can build. and every inch of the ceiling is festooned with Bone Chimes.
---
I DON'T attack other players, though. Never slap, never goad into PvP. Just watch... if I arbitrarily decide that "Sandy likes this one", I'll come screaming into combat, if they look like they'd appreciate the help, and then run away as fast as I can.
---
I dunno. It's all just silliness and time-wasting really, I like to *think* I add to other people's enjoyment of the game? I like to *think* that maybe this is the sort of thing Bethesda wanted when they introduced a multiplayer Fallout? 
---
I like building characters with "character". Though I am aware that the "creep clown" trope is pretty overdone. I also have a dumb-as-a brick ex-boxer, a junkie-trash addict that seeks and devours every drug she can find, immediately when she finds it, and will trade any and all gear, at massively unbalanced prices, for drugs. and then I have my "boring" survival character, that moves camp every night, has a four piece CAMP (sleeping bag, campfire, cookpot and stash box), and only carries three weapons. A hunting rifle, a sidearm and an axe.
---
I have to thank you! Love that hat 
---
That still sounds kinda cool to watch. I'd just go up on the ridge near the town and watch the fireworks.
---
Glad you atleast found a work around for your legitimate items you crafted 
---
I found a quad crossbow last night. We should get together.
---
This 100000 times over
---
The Crosshair top of map, is a raider camp, I managed to scrap together a full set from there when I was low level by sever hopping. Bit of a travel to get there the first time, but to score a full set early in the game was nice.
---
... If you're running a bloodied build, 20 slaps will kill you. (actually, 4 will). If you're low level, 20 slaps will kill you no matter what. 
---
Thanks! It would be fair if you could delay the end of the Fasnacht parade event, since many of us were not able to play for a long amount of time.
---
Ah!  You can now build RADIOS in your camp.  You can build one that plays Appalachia Radio, or one that plays Classical Radio.  But sometimes it plays and sometimes doesn't, don't know why.
---
I just see too many people worry about what others like/dislike. I think people should have free will &amp; decide for themselves *shrug*
---
Or a two shot, exploding, bloodied, weightless, quad rolling pin
---
I noticed that happening too. I get the hell out of there after the parade.
---
Oh, sure.  Agreed on that point!
---
Now let's get after the people who pronounce the "Knell" in my GT as "Neil"...
---
You on PC?
---
I don't want to set the world on fire?
---
Absolutely. I second that. Just max that out and it will get you a pretty decent ammount in one run. Works on a number of containers I might add.
---
Bethesda hates gamers
---
One of the biggest complaints was server instability. This was caused by other players furiously duping items. Bethesda got the blame for it, but I do not believe this was their fault. It feels like victim blaming to shit on Bethesda for the duping problem.
---
I have &gt;5,000 caps and haven’t seen anything that really interests me. Probably won’t actually buy this. I’m trying to get out of excavator armor and into something with more resistance. But I need a bigger stash first. 
---
Rarest I have gotten is the beret. 
---
Ohhhh... it’s a low level event. Okay. I see what you’re saying. I’ll make sure not to do the event anymore, looks like I misunderstood the level requirement for the event. 
---
On the topic of the “fucking moronic” argument, looks like you’re “fucking moronic” ass opted into that “fucking moronic” argument. You play the game, you get to have the same game as everyone else. The game was advertised as no NPC humans, to I guess boost the role play.
---
My role play is the level 200 plus who likes to have fun :) 
---
You’re lucky there are any measure to prevent unsolicited PvP 
---
I don’t want to respond to you anymore. Don’t even bother :)
---
Yes! 
---
I mean to be fair Napolean and Soldier are pretty similar words I could see how someone would get them confused...
---
If you like firing your gun from places a melee mob can't reach you, the jetpack helps in places where marsupial falls a little short. To me, the ability to reach otherwise inaccessible areas is totally worth it. 
---
I'm pretty sure Danny never liked being called Inviso-Bill......unless you like an ectoblast to your posterior, I'd avoid calling it that..... ;-)
---
I didn't know about it...
---
I wouldn't count on it, looking at 76's sales nothing is certain. Fallout games sell like hot cakes, online action games sell like hot cakes. How the hell did 76 do so poorly then? 
---
Or get excavator armour that’s level 25 as well
---
Great DLC would be...great, but yeah I just don't see it happening. Although, this Winter Wasteland thing coming this summer? could be awesome, who knows. 
---
Here's holding out hope. 
---
10-4 so far no players have been aggressive but they have seemed busy so I move on after a bit. I enjoy shooting super mutants most so far ha. 
---
Had an insult bot show up last night, too! 
---
I hate AFK scrubs lol
---
Have this plan, how much it is worth? What do you think?
---
I figured it out and going to edit my post, I'm dumb. I use a mod to sort my inventory (RatMonkeys Easy Sorting and Tagging) and when they wrote the mod they based it off the original names and not the updated one... lol kinda feel a little dumb right now, disabled the mod and it is no listing the masks as everyone else is seeing them.
---
Im thinking the jester and old man winter are as rare as the white powder and BOS jumpsuits
---
do you mean "Can Do!"? scrounger is for ammo I think no?
---
Enjoy it :)
---
Sorry to hear that, eh?
---
I agree I have 7-8 of each (except that damn owl, one day ill have you) and I've yet to them or get them.
---
Fine ill be nice and respond.
---
It doesn't matter if you don't want to PvP. If i want to murder everyone, thats it. I'm allowed to murder everyone. Its part of the game you purchased. Thats the end of the debate. Bethesda advertised PvP, players as raiders, cops n robber bounties... 
---
Some of us view every other human as enemies. Some of us see them as friends.  There isnt anyway to tell who is who and who wants what.. 
---
So fuck it. Nothing against the rules by being a raider.  Murderer. A Psycho.  Its all fair game. 
---
You did know about this when you purchased this game right?  I dont think they will give you your money back.
---
I gotta ask where this hourglass is.  Though I think I know what you mean, I'm not sure...
---
For me. I say out the alphabet making sure to stop on the letterbox items I want to keep. 
---
I think the rare items only come for one day then the other is possible the next, so yesterday was the beret and today is something else
---
Try the Reddit Fallout 76 Marketplace or Bazaar, might have better luck. 
---
That would be a huge help. Thank you if you can /u/Ladydevann
---
False.
---
Oh that evaporation gave me an interesting idea.
---
lets get some crazy evaporation and condenser stuff set up. 
---
Then let us do some cool gastronomy stuff like, evaporate three times the soup or beverage, and condense it down into a more powerful, less spoilery version. 
---
Or let us mix in some glowing resin and some flux or something and we can make little food pearls/ that agar powder DIY caviar.
---
I also saw a cool recipe involving dehydration that makes a white Russian rice krispies treat
---
Or even freeze-dried and powdered versions of some food.
---
The possibilities are endless~
---
Innumerable Unsold copies? Massive price reductions? Hoards of people bitching about it online? 
---
Pretty sure I read people failed during the first day because they couldn't find all five bots.  Before we knew where to look, you have a limited time at the start of the event to access all 5 and start their mini-quests.  Once you do find all 5 you have 25+ minutes to do them.
---
I would've added a picture, but this reddit doesn't accept pics and i don't have an imgur account. (Kinda despise that practice of requiring cross posted images.)
---
Yeah I had that a few times. I guess the event is too easy for the one shot build kiddies. 
---
I keep seeing people with light up glasses. Are those from this? They seem to shine the pip boy light.
---
Keep posting until however long it takes them to implement it, it keeps getting posted for a reason it's because many people share the same view on the matter.
---
Are you talking about the Magnifying Glass icon when you tag items for search?
---
When you are on the junks screen, you can press a button to add an indicator for items you are searching for.  The hourglass is that indicator and it shows up in container inventory screens as well as next to items laying around in the world.
---
In one of the start menu pics, looks like multiple vending machines. Probably possible if that's true. If not then food, Nuka, and alcohol
---
Just for future reference,  
---
All power armors, like weapons and regular armor, have a minimum level, and go up in increments of 10.  
---
Raider Power Armor is available in lvls 15, 25, 35, and 45.  
---
T-45 is available in lvls 25, 35, and 45.  
---
Excavator can be crafted in lvls 25, 35, and 45.  
---
T-51 is available in lvls 30, 40, and 50.  
---
T-60 is available in lvls 40 and 50.  
---
You get a full set of Raider Armor for completing the Raider questline, but if you run it too soon, you're stuck with a low level Black Diamond ski-sword.  
---
You get a full set of Ultracite Power Armor for a BoS questline, also worth putting off for later levels.
---
I'm glad I have been able to recover items and continue to operate Vendor Characters, I deal in Fair trades only and feel like I'm helping others, but I would also not have been upset at losing it all if it meant an end to duping and duped items for good.
---
I thought dev room stuff was PC only
---
Yup.  That's the one.
---
I'm trying to get the Swiss Flag plans, I'm on PS4 if anyone has one, my Username is Crockett03
---
Ohhhhhh lol. Well you cracked the code!
---
Hate the fact that all the windows are broken c'mon Bethesda 
---
This is where I was going to mention. 
---
Raider train stations, maybe the one to the far north of the savage divide
---
I'm on PC too. Look me up. I have a shop open for the Fasnacht parade where I am trading away low-mid level gear for Nuka-colas.  There is often a crowd of friendly people hanging around outside the shop trading plans and helping newer players.  I'll be happy to hook you up.
---
Search for "OrkinMan"
---
wait, what do the russians have to do with anything?
---
link?
---
Than that's an issue you should probably seek help for mate. I'm not saying that as veiled put down. I genuinely have concern for you if you have compulsive buying tendencies.  Give it a google. I'm sure you'll find some good advice on how to curtail your tendencies.
---
The store front in this game has a very straight forward interface compared to many other games. They have stock you can see with a price you can see and sometimes that stock doesn't last forever. 
---
I think Hell Hole would sound better lol
---
This is what we get from a game developer that has lost touch with the community, this game shouldn't even have a PvP mode, let alone "magic" weapons. All Bethesda is doing is alienating the players that built the franchise from FO1 onward.
---
If you don't have any luck I'll build you one on PC.
---
Excellent use of stuff! You rock!
---
I tossed a plasma grenade at the Wolf-mass that attacks the bots at the end of the parade.  Unfortunately I think I killed 2 or 3 of the bots with it.
---
But at that point the "Bots Destroyed 0/5" entry on the Event had already disappeared.  Seems it disappears as soon as you loop around to the church before the Sloth and Wolves spawn.  Or did the 5 times I did it last night.  Wonder if that means it doesn't matter when it gets to that point how many are left?
---
I don’t have it sorry it was on market76 and it was someone responding to a “looking for masks” post I just don’t want to sort through that mess again.
---
I want a jukebox with the speakeasy music
---
hey if you go over the weight limit you wont be able to drop anything. jk
---
There are still server issues, and a variety of bugs. BUT, it's really fun and you should try it yourself and see what you think. 
---
This is incorrect. And why you shouldn’t post stuff like this without thoroughly testing it yourself. This is exactly how misinformation is spread, lack of testing.
---
Exactly, it'll be interesting to see what happens to the economy when 5 stars get introduced. This is my first game like this so is everything except those just going to crash to nothing?
---
Clean straight jacket and owl mask that I got from my first parade drop :)
---
I found that radiation is bad news bears for bloodied builds, investing in a gamma gun or radium rifle might be a good idea. Take advantage of the low health part of the low health high damage play style
---
Had one run last night where, even though most people were paying attention, the suicide mutants were loading in at high level (50 or 62, I forget which it was).  One got through and wiped out all the bots.
---
I think they took everyone by surprise, and we ended up with nothing to show for it.
---
I plan on camp building and doing quests in adventure, but when I play with friends, going to survival
---
Kinda not the same but relatable annoying:  
---
Imagine to want to loot a quick item.  
---
Someone stands near you or wanders throu your vision.  
---
Boom! You looted unneccesary stuff.  
---
I have half a dozen marine dense mods, a robot dense and a metal dense mod, but have never seen combat dense mods.....ever.  
---
I have a really, really nice 3 star combat chest piece, but wear a slightly less awesome leather torso because I was able to put a dense mod on it.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Drives me nuts too, I'd pay the extra supplies to have clean ones. Lets in a nice breeze though....
---
Perhaps Mengele’s Effect applies and it’s been an hourglass all along?
---
I must be lucky, got the owl mask my first try. 
---
The other players may have been looking at a server not responding message.
---
That happened to me on one, the event wasn't failed, but I got the "not responding" message then DC'd right near the end, I was able to quickly rejoin, but got no reward.
---
"barbed" mod gives it the points.
---
The real downside of the pitchfork is your guy swings it like a sword/axe and it just looks terrible, same with the spear... that's not how you use a poking device!
---
I have it in my heart that when the prestige system drops we’ll see more about the true 4*-5*.
---
What I see is this: all legendary mobs have a very small chance for 4-5*. And when I mean small I mean you have a higher chance to become president of the usa. 
---
Every time you prestige you get a passive % added to aid in finding them. 
---
Got three Prime yesterday from SBQ lever, gatling  And laser
---
Haaaan.
---
Lol. Nope. I did not. Really want the owl one. Keep getting the zombie and blue one.
---
Grab plague walker and relish in them! I have literally NEVER really bothered trying to not get diseases OR cureing tgem once i get them. I am forced to eat and drunk a ton to start with that most are not even noticable. 
---
It should still show up, just grey and have a perk requirement notification on the side. 
---
Did you get dumped from a server shortly after getting the plans? That can sometimes cause you to "lose" the plan. Sometimes they come back after a while when the new server catches up. But unfortunately sometimes you just lose it altogether. 
---
Are you getting 0% or an actual % and still missing? Are these across all elevations?
---
Craft them. Super mutants drop it a lot, too. 
---
YES!   I tap it, then start jumping up and down waving so more come hit it.  Most of us could obliterate it, and it can barely scratch u, so please share.  Honestly, the suiciders are more of a threat.  
---
TL;DR PSA - Tap the sloth, you still get your legendary.
---
But the event rocks.  Great job Devs, you nailed this one.
---
Raider sets start at 15 - green trailer at Gorge workshop is always level 15, which confused me because it's behind a level 3 lock. [Here are all the raider armor locations](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1552,1448,1044,1043,1554,1206,1619,1620,1834) in the forest, ash pile, and toxic valley. There are also a bunch in the Savage divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog, but those tend to be level 25+.
---
They need to buff those donuts
---
The couple who games together, stays together!
---
Same thing here. Even the scorched that normally populate the town were the level 68 varieties.
---
But Soulard is still fun!
---
Some asshole shot it down before i could even see it. 
---
I'd recommend using optimized bracers if you plan to melee/bash in power armor.  It will help to blunt the cost in fusion core usage and AP usage.
---
You may also consider the "Full Charge" perk which reduces (level 1) and removes (level 2) the fusion core drain for sprinting.
---
I melee in power armor in nuke zones all the time, with lots of sprinting and power attacks (super sledge) and get good economy out of my fusion cores using these two things.
---
Can't get it for caps, it's only in the ATOM Store. I have \~3000 caps and play for an hour or two at a time about twice a week. It's really slow going, but I'm saving up for a couple of the Chad's mods for the Excavator PA. Or maybe the neon signage.  
---
...f\*\*k, I'm never going to afford those in this economy structure.
---
From the launcher, click "Game Options" and then "Scan and Repair", you might just have a messed up file. 
---
It's a magnifying glass, friend.
---
Reclamation Day is when we leave the vault. 
---
cool, that is good for bug posts, but suggestions not so much
---
I've literally only got the Giants mask each time I've done the event. Kinda makes me mad. I've done it three times. But only got the same mask. 
---
Junk is super valuable.  What the hell is wrong with your friend? Lol 
---
YouTube cap stash routes, can spend an hour and get like 2k every day.  Videos should advise you what perks you need and how to use them.  Cap collector allows you to search cap stashes for more caps (space on pc, once you have the perk)
---
Agreed, but at least it's not a quest that is impossible to complete like so many in the past... 
---
Oooops I meant atoms. I have no caps lol
---
Yeah mostly likely but given the way this game works I wouldn’t be surprised if it did boost rad damage unintentionally.
---
I can't wait to learn donuts lol.
---
I had one in Watoga behind Phoenix's shop blow up and I couldn't find him anywhere.  I finally found him on the roof.
---
great point. Didn't really think about that.
---
Yes no one on this entire sub or anyone I've seen in game has had one. Odd. 
---
LOL.  I did say hourglass, didn't i?
---
In the right hands it is deadly. I was using it the other day while scavenging for lead. 1-2 shooting everything from Watoga to whitespring 
---
Thanks for this mate, I can keep on grinding now that I know they are there, if you don't know then you get pissed off. 
---
I like classical music too, but I can’t stand that song. Also I’ve heard it like 200 times by now so maybe I’m biased. 
---
Where’d you get that outfit? Not the mask the chest piece lol
---
Actually I’m at the entrance
---
You should be able to walk up to another player and invite them to trade. After that pick a piece to sell and put a price on it. Player to player trading has been buggy since the last patch though. 
---
Yes! I moved since it’s pretty cramped though
---
*This game has strong enemies???*
---
Silver because I had this exact experience haha I logged on for this event for the first time in a month or two and it definitely rekindled my love for the game. Glad others are having as much fun as I am.
---
Until I see a dev or anyone else get one, I still don't believe it lol
---
For the longest time I thought it was helvetica...
---
There should be a "tag" mechanic meaning no participation = no reward,  asked a couple folks why they weren't helping,  got responses like "I don't want to/I'm not going to waste the ammo", i"t's boring",  "no challenge", "I'm not here for the masks" etc.  
---
Thank you! They're should be NO PVP in this game. No game developer out there has ever successfully balanced a PvP system in an RPG game. Blizzard never accomplished it with WoW, CCCP never did it with EVE. Your always end up being forced to play the cookie cutter PvP build to even have a chance - in a game that has character customization as a core mechanic. 
---
I'd love a fridge. The idea with a perk card is genious. Imagine being able to "cook" food like the brewing machine and having a way to store perishable food.
---
According to legend if that happens and you come back when it is a meat pile, then it is lootable.
---
I kinda wanted that baret. Doing it whole free time today, still no luck. But i have 1giant, 5owl, 4toothy, 1witch masks.
---
What's the booking sched look like on radBNB?
---
It’s near the vault you can find it on YouTube easily
---
Ooh.  You just gave me an idea.  I could enclose the tree that holds the camp device!
---
I built mine to clear the top of the tree.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7)
---
Wait tnt and dome is different locations?
---
My god, I thought it was Hell-vet-ick-uh. Like the font 😬
---
I normally have really bad luck with these kinda of things. I've been trying to get the owl. It makes me think of the MothFather. 
---
Yeah they went "we have that well know word that everyone know about, let's use another word that only a small amount of people know".
---
You're going to be real bummed when you find out how Versailles, Kentucky is pronounced 
---
Actually my character jabs people with it half the time and smacks them aside the head with it the other half :O idk if yours is buggy or if they patched it or what. Or maybe i just don't think about it hard enough lol &gt;&gt;;
---
But OOOH thank you for the info!! I probably could have gone into the game and checked myself but you made things faster for me LOL xD
---
I have 3 wood resources a few steps from my door, 2 are Beaver Dam Log Piles, and one is an organized log Stack, With the WoodChucker Perk Card, I can get over 100 wood in just a few minutes.
---
This does however require you to build your CAMP in an area that will make using a lot of that wood for repairs a regular occurrence.
---
You are correct. 24 hours after the door opened all vault system are/should be offline. Making the vault deadly to be in. 
---
I don't believe it
---
Sounds like an awesome raider weapon
---
Dunno about the excavator, but the T-60 is in blackbird. 
---
Can you hook me up with the owl mask? I have a spare soldier mask.
---
You can get raider for level 15. Here are some of the main spots I farmed to get a full set.
---
1. WV lumber co in the top left of the map. 
---
2. The supply room under the west end of the massive bridge above Flatwoods. You need to get the key from the top of the Camden park rollercoaster which is fairly easy and can be a quick in and out job
---
3. The rusty pick basement is a good spot as well but it has a tendency to spawn really high lvl enemies for no reason making it a difficult one to get
---
4. There’s also a trailer at wade airport but you need lockpicking 2 I’m afraid 
---
Good luck on your finds! :)
---
There is nothing to do, everyone kills everything with TSE, i afk because i dont want to run around lol.
---
The serums for mutations are 23,000 caps each 🤮
---
If black titanium were your only goal, I'd say prospector maps plus claiming Gorge workshop. Tossing in gears, the Abandoned waste dump is the only place that I'm aware of that consistently spawns two at once.
---
The biggest threat in apocalypse stories is always your fellow man and that's how I see Survival mode going, but I agree Super Mutants should make you at least feel threatened instead of annoyed and you should get a sense of doom from seeing a Deathclaw
---
Yeah cool idea. There’s some candles and skeletons already in there
---
I saw this happen last night too. Another option is to hack up the body into pieces. Nice and bloody.
---
That's a great idea ill add that in!
---
Why am I even surprised that there's a subreddit for this? LOL
---
That's a hard one tho bc it's probably not worth a lot but it's my favorite melee in the game so far so it has sentimental value lmao :D
---
This doesn't work. And if you run with the Good with Salt perk, it actually makes it spoil faster. Same goes for putting it in your stash. Food also goes bad in vendor inventory as well.
---
I wonder if someone nuked the area previously on that sever. I know during the nuke it jumps up their levels. 
---
Ran it 5 times disconnected 3 times and had no loot from the boss at the end every time....
---
That sounds cool! I haven't seen that. If you get a picture of them can you share.
---
That's the one! My mistake
---
Old winter can be bought in the Atom shop. 
---
I don't think 2 workshop PvP experiences is enough to fully understand the mechanics. 
---
UNLESS somebody shows up to join you before you finish.  I've had three in there.
---
And quite a few ghouls lol
---
Many thanks for the silver 😁 I’m also glad you’re enjoying the event as much as I am! It’s always nice to run into friendly people in events like this. I hadn’t experienced anything like it since I first did Feed the People back during beta. 
---
To be fair, I've played since beta and just discovered that like 3 weeks ago
---
I had a quad a couple days ago. I hope whoever found it at morgantown station doesn't waste too much scrap creating bolts for it before testing it.
---
I think I'm just unlucky because the last 10-15 runs I just got witch masks....to many
---
I have the plans for em, it’s a harness :) 
---
That's the hard way.  Mole Miners.  Grab everything they have and scrap it.  You'll get TONS of black titanium and they're way easier to kill than deathclaws.
---
who thought they weren't?
---
Id love it if we could not get disconnected 30 minutes after taking a workshop. Seems I can play for hours without issue but soon as I control a workshop and use some resources to defend it I get disconnected.
---
I'm sure you are aware if you have more than one PA chassis in your inventory inventory (or stash), they are all named "Power Armor Chassis"
---
Of course, that makes it difficult to determine if you are grabbing the one you want.  
---
I end up placing all of them in a line in front of me and checking the contents to determine which is which.  When I find the one I want to work on, I pull the fusion core.  I then recall the frames I dont want to work on and restash them.  If I work fast enough, then the only armor that gets auto recalled is the one I want to work on.
---
Tedious with more than just a couple of frames, but it keeps me from accidentally scrapping the wrong frame/components.
---
Yeah, they don't seem worth it.
---
first game with RNG?
---
Thank you! 
---
Also, there is a Black Titanium resource node just south of the Charleston junkyard and west of the tower.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I have seen it said that people are most perfectly themselves when there are no consequences, to me their behavior in the game would convince me that they are not at ALL someone I would trust.
---
That's the drop I wanted, too. Ah well. Sassages go with beer better
---
&gt;I don't know about most people but the only reason increasing the frequency of NPCs would be harder is because I would get bored and or annoyed one shotting all the mobs constantly.
---
Which is why you'd also increase the difficulty, to a level well beyond anything else currently in the game.
---
Thus also providing high-level content since "just go PVP" isn't an option.
---
&gt;I doubt they'll add in a system where players could "buy" waves and on top of which it would go back to the whole "griefing" thing you guys want stopped.
---
Competition between players does not have to only involve directly shooting at each other.  The most entertaining PVP I've had in an MMO was in Star Wars Galaxies, where I was competing with other crafters for the best resource spawns, pile-of-materials to craft from, and the market.  Not a shot fired, and far more satisfying than "lol I saw you first so you died".
---
&gt;If you could only hold it for an hour it would end up being more annoying any how then any griefing would be.
---
Nothing says you couldn't go take it again when the hour expired.  Probably have some sort of cooldown to allow other players to take it, but not a long one.  This is also the least likely option since it's the obviously lazy one, as well as being unsatisfying to everyone.
---
Amazing how adding some streamers and 4 more robots to the messenger event gets people all excited. I envy your ability to get excited over such hot garbage.
---
The entire sub, apparently. 
---
Why is this downvoted so much? Because of fortnite or something? LOL. Let the bro care about the language needs of his kid ffs LOL
---
honestly farming Whitesprings was too OP, I'm glad it got a nerf...
---
SKAL!
---
I've been on all day, haven't seen any posts about it...
---
Alright  thank you thats super helpful! 
---
I also tried this, but the final chassis would not deploy.  I only had the three and wore the X-01 when its twin appeared.
---
What
---
I've simplified mine by putting atom shop paint on two of the seven sets. Same process, but less scrambling.
---
that's summer
---
I still have yet to have seen the Western Outfits. And I spend a lot of time doing Toxic Valley events.
---
Yup. Can't speak for everyone, but I'm still having fun ~550 hours played since late October BETA. Can't say that I've yet experienced or witnessed anything "game breaking" or that hindered the "playability".
---
I also see that the paint is $8, not $14.
---
Did a nuked run last night and no special rewards based on other runs I did. I did get the chance to take down ~12 lv68 suiciders though, and that was pretty fun.
---
Wat... how do you know it works then? :p
---
I’ll have to try again, it drove me crazy!!!
---
I actually found it once with barbs and flamer as a world-spawn, just laying on a barns floor... still on fire, how did that barn not burn down? 
---
ARE YOU VERY UPSET?
---
Nah, it felt like something was wrong, I've completed the quest like 45 times and nothing rare, and no one has found anything rare
---
Now I know what to use my Berry Mentats on.
---
Thank for the heads up.
---
No one likes raider power armor?
---
Will do. I traded with the first dude I saw and couldn't find it in the apparel, and the person had like six things. I think it might be an atom shop thing but not sure what.
---
Nicely done
---
Thanks for helping 
---
You mean to tell me nobody has gotten a very rare reward after the event has been out for less than a day? Shocker!
---
I found this deathclaw with bloodied, 40% swing speed, and strength. 
---
I hate pvp in fallout though, this OP weapon is all for PVE.
---
&gt;Working on gasoline
---
But uh....you’ve heard about the Resource Wars, right? Like....the planet being out of natural gas? 
---
No one was asking for PvP just like no one was asking for the awful legendary loot system. 
---
Instead of sinking time and money into a special PvP mode they ought to be working full stop on new more interesting events for people who have played the game for more than a week. Fasnacht is fine and all but 76 has needed more high level content since about a week after launch. And Fasnacht should have been so, so much better. 
---
I’m glad this sub is so welcoming, oh wait nvm 
---
It would make sense to me, however I don’t know if it would fit fallout. But I’m not an OG fan, and it probably won’t happen but I think it could be cool.
---
Don't know why I didnt think of this sooner. My mom used to pack my lunch in a paper bag and it was always fresh when lunchtime came. 
---
agreed!
---
The fasnacht event causing issues for people playing in Germany is only a little ironic
---
Usually one in the fridge in the Flatwoods diner. 
---
Do belching Betty instead, with the fire and so on, much more fitting
---
That is sexy as hell! 
---
I've done it upwards of 20 times and never gotten even a beret. Just the core 5 masks over and over again.
---
I use rifle perks and the increased sneak crit card. With instigating effects on weapons can pump out about 870 with sneaks and instigating 
---
That's where I got my first set of PA at level 17, I wandered into the Gorge Junkyard and a level 87 player gave me the "come here" emote, he had unlocked the trailer, and there was a full set of Raider PA, then he dropped a bag with several Fusion cores.
---
A friend of mine gathers the low level PA from a spawn near his camp, builds out a full set, then drops them in Flatwoods.
---
LOL someone is triggered they gott owned!!!
---
The new paint with the soldier and owl mask also look so good:

If someone went on a tear about how they got "griefed" at monster mash, they'd come off as absolutely clueless. Yet here we spitballing ideas how to make workshops that are intended to be PvP zones a PvE friendly environment. It just comes off as missing the point to me
---
Youre awesome. Im hoping thats how that will work.
---
ty for that added it to the list.
---
There's also an arena in the middle of Pleasant Valley that spawns raider PA. Whether it's capable of rolling level 15 when high level players regularly visit, I'm less sure.
---
Yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
---
Kinda hard to tag anything when as soon as the enemies spawn they get instantly obliterated by the tons of  lvl 100+ with TSE gattling guns
---
It was example. there could be anything that it could work on. From fussion cores to some other resources like light panels. 
---
Hopefully I'm right and not just imagining things for your sake xD
---
And that's how I found mine! But I can't remember where I found it. All I know is that it probably wasn't safe to leave laying around, lol. 
---
My non-barbed one was found as a random chance spawn in the pitchforks that are clustered together in the "big tent" in Morgantown where all the smaller tents are, so I guess for anyone that wants one that's one place to check if you get lucky!!
---
I've lost multiple Legendary, and non Legendary weapons this way. I'll be playing and suddenly it's just gone. All I can figure is accidentally dropping them somewhere, but come on how is this happening. 
---
Cool find!
---
I know in Ohio, Cairo = KayRow, Versailles=VerSales, and Paris = PairReese, so it is probably pronounced like you say.
---
Thanks for the original German though!  Any swiss-german want to chime in?  The town traces itself back to the german-speaking part of Switzerland, so that would be interesting as well.
---
Power armor is invaluable. I would recommend getting some as soon as possible. Easy place to farm for fusion cores is monongah power yard
---
I got the beret. It goes nicely with my fishermans outfit.
---
Just be careful where you go. If there is a player in the same area that is a significantly higher level than you, all of the enemies will scale to the level of the higher leveled player. Can be quite demoralizing for fresh players. Not quite sure how to combat this so if anyone else on the sub knows a remedy for this I'm all ears.
---
I think I have a Bloodied Pole hook for sale if you're on Xbox.
---
i know good thing i found a excavator amour just lying around it was also in mint condition lol i bet some one dropped it because they were over encumbered  
---
If you're only lvl 65 I don't think you really grind legendaries enough to notice, or you're not really checking out everywhere. I went to the Bog and traveled to several spots, saw about 5 total lvl 50+ 3s. I'd never just walked around the Bog before but got some good stuff, mostly didn't bother to pick up the legendaries
---
Is that the one that is a skull/pirate look? I want that one as well
---
What does that have to do with it? Iou have thousands of players playing once maybe twice an hour, and in not a single drop has someone gotten one of the rarer masks. Has nothing to do with length of time. 
---
also yea what console are you on?
---
Yup. Appalachia is annoying if it goes with backtracking. I'm not saying that map shpuld be flat. But if you want go frome one side of map to other you have literally burn your way in some places. 
---
This guy is a prick, just read his shitty comments on this post. How tf this guy get those upvotes?
---
To be honest.. The Nuka crate almost had me spend all my atoms back in the day.  
---
Having more stashes customizable may drain my atoms quicker than i can chug a glass of water.
---
Bethesda should look into this idea. They'd please players and have new monetasation option for a quick buck.  
---
During a nuke you can’t do the mission unless you have intestines cause while a nuke is on the area the small animals won’t spawn 
---
Lol it's bound to happen also thanks I didn't know berry mentats show people in chameleon armor
---
Buzzblades unite!
---
Not commenting on if its legit or not but it seems like a regular backpack would have 30 carry weight added and this one has a legendary effect that adds an additional 75 making it 105.
---
Get a suppressors legendary automatic gamma gun. After seeing what it can do to bloodied builds I might add one to my loadout. 
---
Is this a actual mask or glitch? Would like to know how to get it plz. 
---
I accidentally wound up with so much dog food that I ended up investing in the perk that makes them more useful and now they're the best food a guy could ask for..............(I guess)
---
That's cool! 
---
I found you can clip floors and roofing through trees at the 3rd story and above. Just try to get the edges to meet directly above where the tree base is on the ground.

Oh...joy😳
---
I showed up late for the preparation. Was flipping through inventory and fatfingered a bottle of nukashine right as the parade was about to start. Everything went blue &gt; indigo &gt; violet, and poof, I was gone. Came to who knows where (someplace far east side of the map) and fast travelled back ASAP. Maybe killed one supermutant. Still got a mask and a donut recipe. So as far as I can tell, much like Uranium Fever I got while farming mutations, you just need to be in the area when it completes.
---
The player leavez the vault late because they overslept, but it's implied to have only been by a few hours. A terminal entry says that 24 hours after opening, the vault door will shut again and life support inside the vault will shut down. So it isnt possible for a new player to leave the vault on any day besides October 24th, 2102
---
Sneak crit card - I have sneak, but not a sneak crit one ... I’ll check...
---
Don’t rush through the main quest line, which you never know which on is the main, but do the side quests before because when you complete main quests, you get armor and weapons based on your level and so they are sooo much better when they are higher level 
---
it's been just shy of 24 hours. millions of people running the event several times a piece over those 24 hours is a shit ton. if those masks were available, we would have seen one screenshot of one of them at the very least.
---
Is there a linear progression in set quality like in 4?
---
Same for me. But more often I see the thing Im fighting take evasive manuevers last minute and I fall for it every time. The VATS thing is real.
---
Also the west end of the big bridge near the creamery. Always raider armor. And north of the workshop by the water park.. those two places awarded me my first set of power armor that i used for quite a while.
---
Depending on build, I only use power armor for Nuked Sites. 
---
I enjoy it. But I hate GETTING THE SAME MASK OVER AND OVER EVERY TIME I DO IT. 
---
Not really gonna hunt down AFKs. You do you so long as it isn't ruining my play experience.
---
I wasn't literally referring to the existing tag mechanics,  I was thinking more of a participation mechanic similar to the tag, but you are correct all of the non participants swarm at the end for the legendary and it over in milliseconds. 
---
any spoiled meat
---
Did you find it challenging at all? 
---
I love scopes on Shotguns. Nothing is dumber. ;)
---
Or even if death degraded armor slightly
---
Not without the proper ID first there, whippersnapper.
---
the condition of the sausage is large... long... lol sausage
---
It’s a glitch if you equip two of the same mask it happens.
---
That's nice but I'm thinking more an indoor atrium type of thing.
---
The problem is that I'm at max budget.  I wanted to put interior walls around the bedroom, but I can't even build one wall.
---
Yeah, though you have to wait to use armor pieces until you are level 15, since all armor and weaponry are leveled, the power armor frame being the exception.
---
Agreed, I only wish the difficulty scaled better, cuz otherwise it's a bit boring fighting lvl 10 enemies with ppl with 80+ lvl. Also the event could give only masks and plans you haven't gotten yet.
---
This event kinda made my opinion complete about Bethesda staff. I doesn't even matter if those bans/unbans are legit (honestly most are probably legit) - it's about the way this is managed. So first of all we had some really weak dupe fixes, which occured several times in a row. After several patches Bethesda was still unable to stop dupers, they just made them act worse (server crash dupes exploit). TSE Nerfes to make massively duped weapons go low - let's be honest, this nerf wasn't around game balance for the first place. Then it came up with weight limits, twice the times, to limit the span of duped items. Ban wave, unban wave, ban wave again.
---
Honestly. This does look a total incompetence for me. Like some monkeys just hitting random buttons and pushing some random code. 
---
1 cap? :D
---
yea ikr these powering up events are a waste of time and a while goose chase around the factory 
---
Just this past Sunday I had to explain to a level 6 in Spanish the trick to getting higher level power armor than you can equip into your inventory because I make a habit of opening the trailer for any new players at that workshop on my way from Vault 76 to the Nukashine (yes, I'm a cap miser).
---
All the damn time. Even worse in third person than in first.
---
Cool  Thanks ! 
---
I hit Wavy Willards, shit ton of trash cans there
---
Really? Recon short scope isn’t a bad thing 
---
I've only ever gotten a piece of blight once. I think it was off of a scorched, but it's been a bit. Good luck though!
---
Funny, the issue seems worse to me in 3rd person.
---
so we could guess there are new legendary effects for clothings out then? or some leftover what they didn't implemented or didn't implemented yet?
---
But they did add the "make x caps in zone" challenges during the Nukashine update. I got 40 atoms just for playing Faschnacht events this morning, ha. I don't really do vendor runs as much as I should
---
I love that outfit! I want it!
---
Gonna screenshot these comments and post it on filthy casual for fo76 you guys are reallly living up to your name 
---
Like others have said, pretty sure this doesn't work. You might have just gotten lucky with a bug or something. Best way to deal with it currently is a maxed "Best with salt" perk. If they haven't already, they need to add a cooler that works if you connect it to electricity!
---
Shit! It makes sense.. i was tryin to figure out why my stash was full.. 
---
Uhg.. im a hoarder it sucks!
---
Blight is a type of fungus-like growth you can find on trees in the ash heap. 
---
when you pack up your camp, the things that are attached to each other will blueprint, meaning you *should* be able to place your building as one piece as long as it is not obstructed. I haven't been able to do this yet. the mechanics intend for it, and at one time there was a bug preventing it, which Bethesda alleges to have fixed. to date i have yet to be able to pick up and then place my same base again without issue.
---
Ah. Thanks.
---
What it comes down to is, it's not that I don't have the time but rather I just can't bring myself to farm for the stuff I need to be competitive at PvP because it bores the shit out of me. Farming for legendaries suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks, I don't play games to do chores. It's bad enough you've already got to scavenge for materials on a frequent basis.
---
So I do have some measure of respect for people who put the time and effort into their pvp builds, but ultimately my hard drive is full of games I'd rather play when I want to fight other people. 
---
True, but I can always use trial &amp; error with rads until I get the mutation I want, and I have Starched Genes** to lock it in. I'll never get enough ATOMs to buy the CAMP stuff they're selling but not releasing into the actual game. Sucks because they said it wouldn't be "pay to win", and I never thought that would mean "shit all over the builders". There is no true "boss battle" endgame in an MMO, so killing stuff isn't where I enjoy the game. For me, it's all about CAMPs and Public Workshops, and they clearly signaled their desire to use that to bleed me dry. I could see throwing a few dollars at the store here and there, but that literally gets me nothing from the CAMP section. One floor, a stove, and a sign already cost the same as an entire DLC for FO4. They said it would all be reskins, but they are clearly unique assets. No they only say that it's all cosmetic and inconsequential when it's a mode of play they specifically built into FO4. It's insulting to be used as a whale to play it in a way they originally designed unless I only want to shoot stuff. /rant
---
The huge amount of bugs that would come with that... is the first thing that comes to mind.. no thanks. 
---
Don’t let this guy make you feel like you need to be in power armour all the time. There are many viable play-styles without it.
---
Thank you for the map.  I'll head over there tonight and check it out.  I am only level 17, so not sure what to expect.
---
 I'll see how my Explosives work. It is at least entertaining. ;)
---
 But that's a smart response if its ineffective. 
---
But I'm 17 and a half!  Isn't that close enough?
---
i am on pc. just using a ds4 couse i'm used to and the menus are terrible with wasd anyway.
---
A good trick to tracking bots. Well two tricks. 
---
First use vats. If you kill the bot and have spare ap the vats camera will follow them for a short time allowing enough time to see their direction. 
---
Second. Use a gamma capacitor laser weapon. The burn effect will highlight them after death. 
---
You won't get an unbiased opinion here -- it's illegal to criticize the game in this sub. 
---
But yeah, it's getting better. That even a chunk of the launch-day issues have been addressed by Bethesda gives me hope that they're not just going to walk away from this. There's plenty left to fix, and if they make an effort on addressing that and community concerns, sure, this has a chance to be a truly great game. 
---
If you're on the fence about it, I'd say go ahead and pick it up for the discounted price you can find just about everywhere now. At the very least, you won't have lost very much by giving it a try at this point. 
---
but, have the impressed you?
---
No, they really don't. I mean a lot of people have that set duped, I guess. Don't be a dumbass douchebag, or for that matter, a cry baby.  BTW, in case you decide I must be a kid or someone who uses bloodied, I'm not.
---
My point is if you stack your perks right and know what you're doing you don't necessarily HAVE to have legendaries. They definitely help, but they aren't necessary. That was my point. Seeing as how you got so salty though, I'm pretty sure you knew exactly what I was getting at though 🤷‍♂️
---
I've never seen less than level 45 raider armor on that one, even when I was around level 19.
---
I’ve seen a few with the old man winter on fb pages but that’s it none of the ther masks I’ve seen 
---
Has anyone datamined a list of all the new plans from this DLC? Including the fasnacht plans?
---
I have an old list from the original release of the game, but it hasn't been updated for the DLC.
---
If I were Bethesda I’d capitalize on this glitch and put a headless horsemen costume in the atomic shop for Halloween. 
---
It should store as a blueprint in the stored section when you move. I would warn you tho it is usually bugged for me and i usually have to start from stratch again anyway which is annoying.
---
The Mr. Handy says it right, at least! I think? Or at least he gets close........
---
And hunt at night with mr sandman. 
---
the Excavator paint is new in the Atomic shop. it's like 500 atoms, Maybe? I just wanted the change,. 
---
If you are looking only at bugs then yes. I'm looking at practical uses of that. Bugs will be patched. From that what i see big part in game is fixed. There are still bugs (a lot) but from what i see they are doing something with this. 
---
That’s a common complaint I’ve been seeing. It also seems the rare masks aren’t available yet. I’ve yet to see anyone who received them.
---
is it all the players in the server
---
Wow, when did they add it? 
---
I mean, they had that stupid horse armor from FO4.
---
You should be good. It’s pretty easy, and you’re bound to meet some people there doing the event themselves. Have fun 😁
---
Check your settings to see that your chat volume isn’t all the way down. I’ve noticed this happen to me a few times.
---
If nothing else, that's the way the Mr. Handy says it there, LOL!
---
Wow.  That’s insane.  Never even thought of that. 
---

---
What are you using to gauge your FPS?  I have a 2k, 144Hz monitor and use a GTX 980 Ti and the game runs pretty well for me.  I'll do a benchmark tonight and post the results.
---
That makes more sense, I usually have like 50 stein and beeswaxs to get the bots over quickly
---
I have a spare 
---
it was mentioned that rewards are tied to how many robots survive the parade. if we always complete it with ALL robots alive, we'll typically get the same ones over n over again. we need to start completing it with 1 dead, then again with 2 dead, then again with 3 dead, then again with 4 dead. and rotate how many times you complete it with different levels of survivors.
---
he straight up said, if you keep getting the same mask over n over again, try doing it and letting some die
---
In theory. If you've done anything glitchy, like planting plants on campfires or rugs so you can grow them indoors, you'll need to reassemble manually.
---
To be fair, it was the server instability and latency that facilitated the duping, not the other way around. 
---
So much this!   
---
Is it true that "Good with Salt" is broken now?
---
Come on my guy, it was looking pretty suspicious, thousands of players ingame and no rare drops, just multiples of the same stuff? That's some rare shit, but I guess bethesda has done it to ramp up the interest on rare items after the duping shocker... 
---
Yesterday at a Fastnacht Parade I ran into a guy wearing the Sun Mask, so it’s available as loot. 
---
Yesterday
---
I couldn't actually get it, I don't have 76 lol.
---
&gt;Not working on my combat shotgun [...] put a recon scope on my combat rifle
---
Well, if you put the scope on your Combat Rifle of course it won’t work on your Combat Shotgun.  
---
Thank you for your feedback! Truly.
---
Explosive two shot combat shotgun, I’ll put whatever the fuck I want on it
---
It could do with being randomised a bit
---
yes all the time. i have checked my settings many times as well as deleted my save file. 
---
Yeah, I let a pack of newbs claim mine last time. I had to tell them to kill me, as they were running away. Lol, they sounded like it was Christmas. Most times I get sniped from a distance after a decent wait.
---
It doesn’t apply when youre going up against god tier gear, I don’t care which perks you have. For PvE I agree with you but that’s not what we were talking about. In a PvP scenario you can have your build fine tuned but if you don’t have the right legendary prefixes it’s game over buddy. 
---
 Not salty just annoying that you’re acting like you’re educating people when it’s off subject of this threads premise. I think it’s pretty obvious that you should pick damage perks to maximize damage and no one stated otherwise so your post was just you trying to educate people who already know what you’re talking about.
---
Ah, I see! Just here for the pitchforks!
---
That's fine LOL!
---
Well got all the masks everyone has here, the beret and most of the plans. Haven't seen the rare ones but that doesn't mean they aren't in the pool. It maybe like the bos suit, which is awesome because they will be the true rares in this game as it's time limited. I need to get rid of my junk and go for it.
---
wtf are you talking about?  every mask has been found by someone...
---
Okayy Thanks!
---
Then why don't you 😂🤦‍♂️
---
Me too. 
---
I have seen plenty of videos on YT of people getting every one of the masks, it's just RNG
---
But if you want it to work on your shotgun maybe you should put it on the shotgun and not the rifle ;)
---
I have trouble using anything that does not have anti-armor attached to it. Anti-armor does not effect energy weapons as I am told, so I do not see much point to use them unless they happen to have a huge damage value.
---
That being said, I guess I should get around to shooting more Watoga bots with some of the energy weapons I have been holding onto to see if they are at all worthwhile.
---
I think it was yesterday? Had to at least be in the past few days
---
4 and 5 are not good ideas. Materials like concrete (which make the giant walls) are surprisingly hard to come by if you have an entire perimeter of it. I ended up using 1.2k concrete for a full (unscalable with old radworms/strange in numbers/marsupial jump) munitions factory wall. If you had to pay that every time you captured workshops, nobody would capture, because the full wall is 100 percent effective in keeping players out.
---
If they add a “siege” system, any workshop defense would be pointless and eventually return to how it is now, because nobody wants to shell out hundreds of concrete and steel for like 100 bullets an hour.
---
Not to mention, junk already has value. This would only inflate the market you speak of.
---
The Workshop system is fine as is.
---
Short recon scope isn’t a bad thing on a shotgun
---
Each building will get a blueprint. If you have a house and an unattached garage, you will have 2 blueprints when you move. 
---
The trouble, if your building is large. Is that the elevation at next location may prevent you from placing it.  It is a gamble.
---
If you can't place the blueprint, you can have it seperated all out into individual parts.
---
I would creare blueprints before you move. For example, created 1-2 blueprints for the foundation. Then 1 blueprint for each level.
---
I have blueprints for my bar and crafting area so I don't have to recreate those.
---
Building is my favorite part of game. I don't know why, but I like it. 
---
Last night my 1st event and it was nuked back to back in minutes. Not sure why 2 different people would nuke the same spot within minutes but it ruined the event for me. I don't get to play much and I thought this was them trying to ruin the event and make the cosmetics more scarce so they could sell theirs for higher at a later date,
---
This is pretty sick 
---
Ah. I've seen people with the owl, toothy, the summer or whatever it's called, the goblin, and maybe one more. I know you can buy the summer one in the atomic shop. But still. I'm not gonna pay for a mask I can get for free. 
---
If be more into it if it could be nodded to be comparable. Also needs paints. 
---
I looked it up and also I believe it says it in the setting when you enable it
---
Didn't work for me but thanks for the suggestion. Would be nice if Bethesda said what's going on. I could careless about the parade...
---
Get the feeling that the other masks may be on xbox or pc, like half the week u can only get the masks we’ve seen then itll switch so that ps4 gets the masks xbox had and vice versa. Completely speculating at this point. May just be a thing where if you participate enough u get the even rarer masks? No idea

I run an unoptimized unarmed build. I have all the strength perks and mutations, but I do not run max perk on all the other special stats related to unarmed. My instigating 2* DC gauntlet regularly puts out ~350 damage if I am on a team. I can oneshot most mobs and players that don’t run a high DR build. Incisor perk is the one that makes all the difference in my opinion. It allowes you to practically ignore all DR. But I have to get close and have the enemy at full health to be the most affective. 
---
I think that people are crying melee is op just because they do not understand the perk and mod system enough to maximize their damage output. And the fact to be most potent with 2h and 1h they have to give up all the weight reduction perks in the strength tree. I gave up everything but traveling pharmacy. 
---
It's pronounced Yeeh-rohs, not Jy-rows (Gyros). 
---
I think the whole point of this thread is lost on you. 
---
I am literally asking if anyone is selling a code.
---
I've refrained from asking out of an effort to be nice but are you cogent?
---
Valid point, the server struggles just to accommodate the number of bbn players in the parade, it almost dies when the spawns happen. 
---
It occurred to me the other day that the game has to let all of us see what's going on in the server, and what's going on for everyone else. I know on PS3 and some other online games I've played, if someone in the party or even in the area has really slow internet or issues with their wifi, the lag that causes between them and the server gets translated to some degree to the people around them, because what they see and do has to be sent to the server and then sent to everyone else. That could honestly be a huge part of the problem. People that have been playing single player games up until FO76, and only have internet that barely good enough for Netflix. Now they're on a server based game where they have to send and receive information from a server that needs to share that information with 2-23 other people.

Which is honestly a fault with our American consumerism. In places like the Netherlands or Hong Kong, everyone has the same blazing fast internet. They don't sell different "speeds", because it actually costs more money to slow it down than it does to just let it be as fast as it can be without any interference.
---
Umm ok
---
rewards are tied to how many bots survive, not how much you participate. completing it over and over again with 5 surviving bots will put you in the same loot pool. it's hard to explain this to 20 people trying to help out, but in order to get different masks/loot pool, you have to let some die.
---
5 surviving bots = a loot pool
---
4 surviving bots  = a loot pool
---
3 surviving bots  = a loot pool
---
2 surviving bots = a loot pool
---
1 surviving bot = a loot pool.
---
almost impossible to get in the 1-4 survivor loot pools when everyone kills everything and keeps all 5 alive every time.
---
Where did you wind up planting that beauty on the map, if I may ask?
---
Yeah it's basically been confirmed since I made this thread. I guess Bethesda wants us to take power plants instead of just running around Watoga. 
---
This doesn't effect most beginner areas. Flatwoods and morgantown and others are locked into appropriate levels.
---
Just go on eBay and what's a cogent?
---
Killed those in 2 days.
---
No, you could activate the perk, overfill your stash, then turn off the perk effectively bypassing the stash limit
---
LOL. Good job, Bethesda.
---
Its a shotgun. Go ahead fill yer boots. Your mic is probably off, and you won't hear me laughing. ;)
---
Just don't tell our parents, plz.
---
That's good but at least it means they're adding them

I can second the realism.

Damn son
---
I only get about an hour or so of FO76 play time per day on weekdays. So unless I call out "sick" I'm not going to be able to grind this event too much. I should tell my kids Dad gets the TV but it seems mean.
---
Go melee at first. You may have ammo supply shortages early on.
---
Probably my favorite, my second being the canvas (cheap nylon) one
---
Just go on google...

I’ll help you out.

You got the link? 
---
TS makes them really inaccurate. Have fun!
---
Of course I am cogent
---
Recently I wanted to be able to hear people so I got some things changed in my settings. I noticed I couldn't hear. But I was able to previously. My mic would react randomly despite being off with a switch in between. I don't know what to make of this..
---
The turrets should get progressively tougher HP wise. You can't tell me it adds 25 defense and then have it get destroyed in one hit. Glass cannon bs lol

Helvetia is a *very* old name:
---
&gt;All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another; those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third....   
---
&gt;**\[T\]he Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valour, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers.**

---
I have a non ts explosive one too ...
---
This.
---
Love this idea but until the current means of taking over workshops is fixed/changed it's pointless.   
---
I fell into one. IIRC it was somewhere east of Fort Prickett. Maybe it's this one. I dunno.
---
Been using my laser rifle before the buff and after. For me the durability was never an issue. The damage is welcoming. 
---
The standard laser rifle feels the same.  A kin to the combat rifle. 
---
The sniper barrel to the hunting and lever action. It feels weaker to me. 
---
And automatic is not bad. 
---
Over all they have a longer time to kill but the ability to ash your foes is always good. 
---
Well that’s a relief thanks. 
---
thx bruh
---
I resolved deleting the last windows update:
---
Go to settings; Update and security; Windows update -&gt; update history; uninstall updates and delete all the 19/20 march updates minus security
---
There's so many bugs 76, where do you draw the line between quality of life bug against abusing a bug. But then we don't even know what is/isn't a bug or not.
---
The spoil rate of food seems to change every single patch. We probably don't actually know what a proper spoil rate even is. Is that a bug?
---
Radworms buffed everything by 50% for a month until it got fixed. This occurred when they tried to "fix" it in the first place.
---
Look back to December. Players could spam the use button on the event Battle Bot to gain the rewards multiple times. 
---
I can occasionally enter a nuke zone and not gain any rads from it. Is that a bug or is it a feature? To quote an old WoW thing "Clever use of Game Mechanics". 
---
Another quote about Fallout New Vegas reads "This game is held together with string and good wishes at the best of times." That feels like it applies to Fallout 76 too. They have a long history of non-stop fuck ups, yet people seem to still hold them in high regard. It's baffling.
---
I finally saw the sloth this morning. I hit him twice at half health but he died so quick and the lag was so bad that it didn't register.
---
I enjoyed it all the way to the end when my lvl 19 friend decided to start a fight with all the lvl 100+ people and being on the same team considered me hostile too, I dont pvp unless someone messages me asking so I really wanted to kill him then or atleast put a 1000 cap bounty on him.
---
TeamSpeak? What are you, a 2008 WoW raider?
---
But is it a **Shotgun** or a **Rifle**.  Or is it both?
---
I dont like games with vehicles likes these. power armor is fine. 
---
Thanks! As soon as I saw the mask and paint, it clicked for me so fast. Great look. 
---
Congratulations. Rude and unpolite. 
---
Got reactive plates just for pvp mode coming out
---
Yeeeeesss
---
Not the first. I failed because of a glitch which made the bots stand still, And that was yesterday.
---
(weird flex on me)
---
I would jump back in the vault if I saw this coming at me haha 
---
Link to post or video ? 
---
Are weapon classes still split between melee, pistols, rifles, automatic, and heavy? Once I find enough ammo which gun class would you recommend?
---
im doing the "???" emote right now
---
800 ATOMs in the shop, according to the newsletter.
---
No xbox
---
Yes, the recipes show up just not med-x specifically 
---
It was mentioned live during Bethesda fallout 76 stream today by Matt. 
---
Are you on XboxOne? I have a bar and we’re open tonight. 
---
I'll try that and see what happens.
---
The workshops should be PVP zones. The player on the other side of the map should not. I understand the mechanics and have a full set of PVP gear for when I want to play that sort of game. The idea with PVP in workshops is that you should be fighting over the workshop, but as it's balanced now that's is not the reason people fight there.
---
There is like 10 quests in the entire game, it's pretty easy to know where to go.
---
Sure,but next week, as event end everyone will be selling spare masks!
---
I'd like to see that.
---
Two in the past few days. I quit playing the workshop game a long time ago when this first started being a thing. Now I just use them to farm caps off other players.
---
rifles are powerful ..even at early level..i dont wanna spoil to much for u tho..also dont worry about food and drink..they are EVERYWHERE
---
Where do you go to see that 
---
It WILL save anything on foundations as one unit, so in theory, your house with bed, crafting stations, pictures, lights, etc. are all saved as one unit you can plop down all at once. However, you can also have difficulty actually placing the blueprint down in the new spot. I moved my camp last night, picked an area that had plenty of space to build, but when I went to put my 3-story home down, it kept saying something was floating, and it wouldn't let me place it. Ended up having to rebuild it from scratch again.
---
Fuzzy junkies are the worst. Every group has one. Dont be that guy!
---
BOS mods cannot be learned thru scrapping (not counting helmet paint).
---
Heavy/Sturdy/Light are just "tiers" of Combat Armor.  They cannot be learned thru scrapping, you must find/buy the plans.  Vendors sell Sturdy and Heavy combat plans.  Light can be found randomly or thru quest rewards in the Free States (Abbie's Bunker).
---
No vendor sells BOS Mod Plans.  Currently have not found them in wild, may be rare spawn at Mod Plan spawn locations or Map rewards in Cranberry Bog.
---
Mods learned for one Tier of Combat Armor can be applied to Any Tier.  Light, Sturdy, or Heavy.  Doesn't matter.  Same with all others, like Leather, Robot, Metal, etc.
---
It was on twitch. Might be able to rewatch the stream. He said it near the end
---
Some people really aren’t meant for the wastelands 
---
This needs to happen as a priority. This should have happened months ago. It actively hinders player trading in the game where they actively promote player interactions.
---
It's a little small don't you think? :)
---
You have my curiosity: why is it that turning your foes to ash is a good thing?
---
That's lowballing it I'd personally pay 7-10 depending on how many they have. Considering how much the Mr Fuzzy mask goes for that's a fair offer. Not to mention the time you save. 
---
Is anyone able to make me lead champagne? I’ll pay for it :) I only have the tick blood margarita.. 
---
I've been pretty hesitant to post anything on here about this issue and it takes a post like yourself that actually makes sense for me to want to do so. It's not that I don't think most of these suspensions are legit, it's more so their insane track record full of erroneous choices that everybody else seems to overlook. These are the same people who messed up headlamps out of pure laziness. Their decisions are also so influenced by marketing that they failed to even have a legitimate beta period which would have prevented a majority of these problems and rushed the game to release it during Holiday season as opposed to delaying it to March.   
---
Even the unban wave seems oddly suspicious in it's timing. Think about it.... we just happened to have two weeks of sales and no limited items that anybody actually cared about. The free pose doesn't even work anymore. Then new content drops and these suspensions are lifted. The fact it sounds like nobody got e-mails makes it seem like they wanted to double down on the issue and use it as some viral tool to promote the game and it's new content.   
---
Also I do 100% believe these suspensions were lifted intentionally and because somebody must have found a hole in their solutions, they opted to reverse that decision until the next patch where new content will drop again.
---
Throw in solar powered and some consumables and you can hit 50. Pretty crazy. I don't expect unyeilding armor to stay in its current form for much longer.
---
Cool, how do we go about it? Do I just down you then revive? 
---
Or The Brotherhood of Weekend Afternoon Naps!!!!
---
Yeah its gotten better after this update. Game wasn't ever that bad as they say it was  but my faith in it was restored when I heard they still work and update the game frequently.
---
I mean, obviously you don't. There are specific perks for specific situations. Then there are the weapon and armor mods that can further assist. I'm not saying it's easy, but it can definitely be done consistently without legendary affixes. If you just give up when the battle starts then if course you're going to lose. Seek revenge and reperk/remod and wreck the little Bloodied Shithead. It feels good, I promise.
---
Second that motion. 
---
Oh god.
---
What about the suspended accounts? Why are we all suspended again? I was under the impression the temporary suspensions were lifted after the last patch/ weight limit hotfix. Please let us know what's really going on...
---
Was playing my account just fine with my husband all week and he got the error last night (we didn't even start the new event bc he was waiting for me to come home from work) and I was still able to log in until this morning when I also got the error.  The only thing I have done since being released from the first suspension was the quest chain for the sorority Row area and dailies with Biv.  I also sought out the New paint job for my XO1, opened that bunker with the now functioning keypad, and lastly farmed the hell out of a nuked Whitespring area.
---
I think this is going to be an issue in general once the CAMP display feature is added.  Accidentally scrapping all those teddy bears you wanted to put on your shelf, etc.
---
Seeing "had fused to his spine and skull" summed up as 'wore' mad me laugh unreasonably.
---
You can also collect them before the event and then turn them in. 
---
I want that owl mask, hopefully soon...
---
If you can move faster with PA alright then. Also i don't mentioned about any combat purposes (a cover should be enough) only transport
---
Yeah that mothman made poor life choices. 
---
Why? The low health makes it a dangerous option, and isn’t viable in nuke zones. All that strength is almost useless as you don’t need it to kill normal mobs. 
---
I'll be honest, I don't think there is a link.. 
---
Maybe it’s me or lag. But mob I get near to killing with like 5-10% health left always ash on me even when the shot shouldn’t have been the killing blow. 
---
Also the effect is just satisfying 
---
The condition of the food in the paper bag will reset to the condition of the new food in your inventory once you pick it up.
---
Yes you can. I haven't made them yet because... crossbow. But i can make this nonsense if anyone wants to try it.
---
They're saying they're color blind and need it to be more visible to the color spectrum they can see. 
---
I blueprint smaller modular designs that work well with most workshops.  I can put them up pretty easy and then go from there to customize the specific location.
---
My favorite part is standing around with players making fun of the "content".
---
Wait 20 mins. Get mask. Yay?
---
Pack it up. Perfect quest. Bethesda nailed it. No more updates needed. This one will keep us busy for months to come!
---
The main reason people fight there is because there are no PvP servers. There aren't many places you can fast travel to with complete certainty that you'll get PvP. Even monster mash isn't a guarantee. But a workshop with the owner doing a defend event? Guaranteed PvP if you contest it.
---
whaaaat!?!?!?!? this cant be right, its too soon...
---
This gets posted every single day people literally every day. No offence just making that clear.
---
For those saying it doesn't work, he didn't explain it well at all.
---
1. Drop 50% condition food on the ground.
---
2. Craft new version of the same food.
---
3. Pick up the food you dropped.
---
4. That food you picked up will now be at the condition of the stack already in your bag.
---
I likely won’t be on until late tonight, maybe 8-9 PST. Won’t be on at all tomorrow. Friday afternoon is possible though. 
---
IGN (InGameName; IE, your Bethesda account name)Tazier, what’s yours? 
---
Hey at least we're all in it together, right?
---
Spouse calls it "Helvetica" just to annoy me.
---
Do u know where we can get those plans? I didn’t complete the nukashine quest.
---
Duper. Report him.
---
Anti does work on plasma guns. However. 
---
There one of the few that can burn your target. If your a solo player that doesn’t matter to you but in a team fight say a SBQ or whatever that can help dps numbers. 
---
Laser rifles and pistols can make for a good back up weapon if your hurting for ballistic ammo. 
---
Don't feed the Yao Guai!
---
Oh? I am intrigued. Where is this mothman hive mind lore? 
---
I know there can be Scorched Mothmen, so it makes sense that they would fight the Scorched as much as possible, to avoid being subsumed by the Scorched Plague.
---
Sometimes there are a lot of chickens across the stream right by that area. It was great because I needed chickens and squirrels, I didn't find any squirrels when I was there but the spawn might switch between the two animals.
---
If only I could complete the event even once. Tried three times on PC and every time server crashed in the middle or near the end of the event.
---
Quick question. Do you know if you can engage in PVP while the defend event is ongoing? Doesn't it place you on an "event team" or does claiming override that. I haven't thought to try yet.
---
You online
---
Worked for me. Thank you &lt;3
---
Also Better Inventory screwed it up but I restored to vanilla and game runs fine
---
Mine is PeachieBear ill add you again thank you so much 
---
Yep. I've been there twice. Both times there were 3 Deathclaws.
---
it over rides it
---
So close ;D
---
Sure. Hope I get it by then!
---
Yes. Thats how I did it the first time.
---
Have you checked out your CAMP base and see if the "repair all structures" is an option?
---
I had a turret ontop of a foundation piece one day early in my gameplay, it was destroyed but then was rendering inside the foundation.  I could not see it to repair it.  Thought it just disappeared.  Finally went to my CAMP and repaired all structures, it reappeared.
---
u can buy the entire suit from the market subs here
---
I wish the vendors just reset at a specific time each day instead say midnight or something. Sucks to sell late one day then try to sell early the next day and cannot. 
---
In PA, the "breath" is really just locking your armor, so using core power makes perfect sense.
---
It not being only limited to how much power you have is what makes no sense, you're not hold8ng your breath in that case.
---
Have the emus started a war on bears now?
---
I believe heavy metal is best.
---
Cuz energy sucks so you don’t have to protect from it.
---
Combat is slightly better than marine for defense.
---
But imo armor rating doesn’t matter, only legendary effects and weapon damage are important to me.
---
Yep, I popped that just to see if it helped, but no love. 
---
Would love one! Don't have that yet. I'll be on this evening hopefully :)

Caps lock is the worst button for push to talk. Even remapping it detects me pressing it less than half the time.
---
They are acquired through the Miner Miracles quest in Ash Heap.  Get to level 25 and finish it (involved building the Excavator Power Armor).
---
Wish you were on XB1 so I could show you how wrong you are, there’s almost no scenario in which you can beat a character with got tier legendaries, with no legendaries yourself. You stating otherwise is obviously false. 
---
People who have this gear, me included, have the same perks as you. It’s not some secret build, it’s pretty obvious actually so quit grandstanding and acting like you’ve got some god killing meta cause you have the same perks as 99% of other PvP players. 
---
Not sure where you got your “give up when the battle starts” scenario but now I see that you’re moving onto personal attacks since you can’t handle being called out for an off topic comment that is patently false.
---
Like everyone else is saying in theory yes you should be able to but I've had awful luck with it. I usually just try to remember where everything is and disassemble it all because on multiple occasions I've moved my base and lost stuff if I didn't 1st store it and relied instead on the camp plans
---
Yes, the way the Mr. Handy pronounces it is correct
---
Well that will be easy to communicate to 15 people jumping around wasting the handful lvl 10 enemies 
---
They wont because there's such a thing as being revived and all the things that are put into the game around it , i.e. life saving armor, mysterious savior, revenant.

Imagine, waking up from a nukashine blackout, spinning your head in confusion as you try and get your bearings. You hear a screech. Is it another scorchbeast? Suddenly you die. Ran down by 69LulzURmom69.
---
&gt; EDIT: wow expressing frustration with a mechanic of the game sure is controversial huh 
---
Well, first, you aren't talking about the mechanics of the game. You're complaining about getting your junk stolen. During a SBQ event, which is always chaotic and messy and lots of people die and maybe, MAYBE someone took your junk thinking it was theirs. I've had that happen with friends, FRIENDS, where bit off more than we can handle, and had multiple deaths, and took each others stuff by accident. 
---
I don't know what you read about the game before you bought and started playing. But taking other people's junk is literally a design of the game. We are all scroungers, looking for junk to use to survive. 
---
So, if you didn't know your junk could be stolen. Congrats.
---
And if you think that things like fighting the SBQ should make stealing someone's junk a dick move. 
---
Wrong. You, me, that guy over there, the dog with the shifty eyes, none of us get to impose our morality on someone else, when it comes to what the game is literally designed for. 
---
So, next time. STORE YOUR JUNK. 
---
THANK YOU. I was looking for some sort of indication that my stuff was fermenting. That makes sense, I wish it was a bit more obvious.

[Blight, Fallout 76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blight_\(Fallout_76\))
---
I'm 30 this year, I play Fallout to escape the wasteland I live in. Rain is a constant, it's cold, there are rats everywhere, mutants in abundance but I can't kill them... That would be breaking the law, so I use the fallout fantasy to take out my anger on the ugly world I actually live in. 
---
The joys of smelly immigrant ridden England. 
---
 They don't hurt me but I am unusual. My party trick is emptying an Auto Grenade Launcher into the ground at our feet. ;) 
---
Whenever you see any enemy, spray it with shotgun. The enemies are so low level. To get the event and some masks, you only need to be there. Other players will do everything anyway, even if you completely afk. Though with super mutant suisiders at later stage, you don't want to afk at least in open. 
---
Particularly there is 1 star legendary at the end, try to rush to damage it before its killed, so you can get some legendary item you might be able to use later. Maybe some plans and other stuff.
---
 It might be level 30/35 so you won't be able to use it instantly, but then, most legendary 1 star items are pretty useless anyway. It dies fast so you might need to do it few times until you know the exact moment it spawns, to rush to damage it. Shotgun is best since you only need to tag it, but it really dies fast, even low levels would kill it fast because there' so many players around.
---
Also I don't know about others but Im dropping few common camp plans ect on the ground if there's enough low levels around, since the event easily pulls 10+ players to same place. If I'd have any I'd drop lower level legendaries too, but with restricted stash/inventory space can't keep any so don't have any.
---
I run 1 piece of chameleon and 4 pieces of vanguard. Ultralight build for all to reduce weight and increase AP refresh. I think you would ideally be looking for secondary stats to boost your sneak and AP though. My set it put together around FDC weight reduction so I dont have to run Thru Hiker or Traveling Pharmacy, which frees up points for perk cards that do enhance my build (VATS crit/sneak). 
---
Perception Rifleman, Expert R, Master R each increase damage by 20%
---
Perception Tank Killer penetrates armor and may cause stagger
---
Intelligence Gunsmith
---
Agility Combat Operative sneak attacks do more damage
---
Agility Escape Artist sneak to lose enemies
---
Agility Mister Sandman silenced weapons at night do more sneak damage
---
Luck Tormentor chance to cripple limb
---
Shoot the head for organics, exhaust or power supply for robots, and cars for big booms.
---
There are 4 trees with Blight on them close to Hornwright Testing site nr 3 in the Ash Heap, so with Green Thumb you should easily get 8 blight there for some quick crafting.
---
Would be wood armor if it was not bugged to have only one star.
---
Shrouded wood armor with agi and better sneak would be best in slot.
---
You can go for wooden chameleon armor.
---
Or whatever with shadowed mod.
---
Because sneak was bugged for long time i have mixed armor with sentinel and i am kinda tanky.
---
We faired pretty well against humans. So why not?
---
Now I just gotta find a bunch of shit to craft it!
---
I believe there's one in a trailer at Firebase Hancock. 
---

---
I got mine from the daily quest you get from BIV who you meet after the quest.
---
But for those times where you die instantly without getting a chance to be revived? 
---
I sell my tokens 20caps each
---
Also for those bad weapons, if they are more than 1 star, they could have more effects than initially described. Use R3 i think on ps4, when viewing weapon, to see all effects.
---
44 here. I have a deck on the 2nd floor of my CAMP house.  I often play my guitar up there, and scream at the mole rats to “GET OFF MY LAWN”
---
Melee can 1 shot in pvp but some bloody ranged weapons on the correct build can do the same without a vats crit even if you have full assassins/sentinel and you are gonna take power armor into pvp mode. Best wishes to you, where should I send the flowers for your funeral? 
---
Yep like it or not but this is pretty much how I feel about the event after 3 times doing it. 
---
It's so small, there's zero challenge, there's no RNG involved it always goes the same, there's a lot of waiting oddly at different phases when the preseeding tasks are done. 
---
You can just go there, park yourself on roof and then be completely afk for the next 15-20 mins. It feels so meaningless. But yeah judging by all the OK and love emotes, people seem to generally like it. I hope in future we will have more levelled events, where if nothing else, then at least the spawning enemies would take account the large number and levels of players.
---
I think the best part for me about the event, is you can kill about 10 squirrels. I mean normally anywhere you see just one or two. I haven't been to Helvetia before this event so during it I also explored it first time all. If those squirrels are normally there then I didn't know about it.
---
It's all okay just that I can't find anything to be really exited about it. 
---
Perhaps the second best thing is to imagine how many people are farming the event, just so they can get some that are genuinely rare, just so they might be able to trade it for, well for whatever. But I prefer direct fun over indirect third party fun, so squirrels are the best.
---
As smart as they are, let's just say my mother has a hard time navigating an iPhone. Brilliant people, but a little out of touch with the current state of technology, lol
---
True. Yet theres bounty for his head (big if you play on pvp server and almost 0 damage if you play on pve server). Nothing special. 
---
If you're in a rifle build, you'll burn through tons of ammo. So:
---
Save up your steel &amp; acid. When you've got a large stash of both (e.g., 400 steel, 100 acid), visit Lucky Hole Mine in your Excavator power armor and mine lead ore. This will let you craft large amounts of 5.56 ammo. 
---
For further efficiency, I highly recommended Super Duper, Ammosmith, and Bandolier perks cards for rifle builds.

---
Welcome to MMOs, two weeks is a drop in a bucket, 6 months or more is the norm.

Also, this may shock you, but a vendor is not "content".

Lol, you think millions of people are playing this game daily

Super mutants quite often drop gunpowder as well, with which you can craft more ammo.
---
I've always been a fan of the in game cars, I actually bought the 1:18 model Fusion Flea that "The Wand Company" put out and now I'm working on getting the "Pick-R-Up Truck" and supposedly, their next car after the truck, is the Corvega  Chryslus, that long ass car with the 4 doors and partial glass roof. 
---
Thanks. I am almost complete with that quest but I just have to craft the power armor.
---
My wife and I are both 52 and both play. wed be down for an AARP clan!
---
I have noticed in the game (by robots) it seems to be said correctly.  I keep forgetting to pronounce it correctly myself.  It hard when it does not sound how English is typically read.  But I think posting like you did is great to remind us!
---
That's where we disagree and the "leaf-eater" comment comes into play. (Not really an insult, by the way, just different ways to play this game)  I like pretending to be a bloodthirsty Raider hunting for human skulls to sacrifice to the Blood God, but it's okay to have no desire for any of that. I think the combination of different playstyles makes things interesting in this game.

 I would hate for people to feel too safe while exploring the wasteland.

Handmade 556 faster fire, lower per shot dmg
---
Combat rifle 45 same as handmade
---
I think I've got masks all 3 times.
---
Sometimes right after the event ends I rush to check if it counted for some of the atom challenges, and it blocks showing what I got. I got one recipe too, for some donut or whatever.
---
Heh, even worse than you think, there's three people in power armor out of shot, there &gt;&lt; 
---
I'm on xbox as well. I need some lead myself so if youd like to team up I can escort you thru. It's not very hard anyway but I know by heart most of the lead spots now. I'll be on a bit later tonight if you want to team. 
---
Well done.
---
I'm 100% down with this idea.
---
34 and 37 here. Goals!
---
There are mods that change ammo types, but this is the initial ammo for each weapon.

Yes, and make the lock work so you can't sell or  trade or scrap.  I hate the rolling inventory where it reshuffles  and moves things around.  Please make a locking addition and also add a prompt if you go to unlock it to verify you want to unlock it !
---
There is already some incredibly OP'd Weapons and Armor in the game, even with some things being double nerfed, so the only way I can see that Weapons and Armor progression can continue would be on separate Servers for level 150+, or something like that, and once you move to the High level servers, there's no going back.
---
I do have hopes that the New Legendary Vendor will essentially allow us to custom configure Weapons and Armor with the legendary effects we want by trading in other weapons.
---
Totally agree, there needs to be more then play 7600 hours for 20 caps or killing over a thousand robots with x weapon
---
I hate Fasnacht. 
---
To Bulk items and sell to vendor bots and making shotgun shells. 
---
I’ve found it to only detect if I’m pressing other buttons. For instance I walk forward and push to talk at the same time and it always works for me. Same goes for my change POV button. If I’m standing still and just try to change perspective it doesn’t always work, but if I do it while moving forward it always does.

Whitesprings abounds in Abraxo which scraps to acid.

I'm sorry your "friend"is a jerk and you should get new ones. I found really nice people that I can all friends through fallout76. About your questions get the "good doggy" perk (I think that's the name)that will give you 50% health when eating dog food. The "cannibal" perk is also good when you kill ghouls, super mutants etc you can eat them and that will give you health. And the "Collition course" event at Morgantown airport helped me level up when I was lower lever. Hope that helps you :)
---
It is not fun to do it 10times to get baret and have mostly frikin owls!!!
---
I hate that music!!!one more time! Baret must drop now!
---
I think he means behind the scenes.
---
There's probably too many already possible variables that would make it harder to implement than it's worth.
---
Unless my estimate of time passing is off it's slightly faster. I did it twice on same server while using someones camp right next to the town, I had to wait maybe 20 mins before it reset. 
---
Though I also fetched some T flux thing from nearby Greg's mine supply. Still I'd say I waited max 30 mins between the two runs.
---
I'd be more inclined to agree with you, if said "wolves" (heh.. .well, I  guess it IS a game in which people get to act out the things they aren't in real life) didn't get salty when I crush their skulls to pulp when I finally get sick of their shit.
---
Too many of them want to be the aggressor and victor, but get mad when the dice don't roll their way.
---
I think you're talking about the streaming settings not recording
---
Like the division does 
---
I’ve tried and got no luck :(
---
Lag?  Check your internet connection, I've had no lag during the event.  
---
I always gave everyone either a minigun with 2 bullets, or a missile launcher and 1 missile. It was amazing
---
This is a good addition.Much appreciated!

It's not as bad as saying "George Junkyard", which a lot of people do.

At night, you are doing 3.75 times sneak attack damage. Aim for the weak spots and you can damn near 1 shot anything with 2 legs using a regular hunting rifle or lever action rifle. Pick up a instigating anything and you can drop Gutsys with 1 shot. Assaultrons usually take 2 to the leg.  Deathclaws 3 to the head. If you get the drop on a SB you can kill it before you have to reload the clip.
---
Better Criticals perk is bonus damage for when you pop those crits off.

[Rifle build with mutations](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f345fc&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl2a72ar2an2a51ao0ic4c72lu2lt2l71s01a30a00au0e60e10ef0lv2l10&amp;w=&amp;n=New%20Rifle/Crit/Mut%20build)
---
Eagle Eye, Bird Bones, Speed Demon and Marsupial all work together nicely for a ranged VATS build.  I also use Carnivore &amp; Healing Factor (though they are quality-of-life perks more than anything else). At level 30 with the mutations, I was wandering the Mire and Bog looking for anything to put up a bigger fight. Mirelurk Queens are a pain until you blow their acid spewing things off using VATs.
---
Daytime is a bit slower as you are back to 2.5 times sneak, but again, anything with two legs level 68 or below drop with 1-2 shots.
---
A single piece of chameleon armor works wonders with whatever else you can slap together.
---
A huge chunk of your VATs accuracy is determined by the scope on your gun. Even if you never use it, get the biggest one you can (long NV, recon, etc).
---
No, some ugly soldier this time, oh my god. I already spend 1/3 of my life grinding on world of warcraft, why is this happening :D
---
Not here to brag but I've managed to make my bloodied rifleman/sniper build superior to these melee builds, can no longer be one hit... And it's great.
---
Weird thing though, why do these melee bloodied builds always seen to be wearing summer shorts outfits and dresses even when their character is a dude lol. It's funny but at the same time, what's the deal? 
---
Since Bethesda chose twitch as the place to tease their F76 release, I use twitch viewership as a kind of metric.   Here's the rough monthly stats for March 2019:  
---
Average viewership:  341 (#176)
---
Average live channels:  55 (#81)
---
By comparison the average viewership around release in November 2018 was 20,000, and December 2018 was 2,500 or so.  The original teaser had 1 million unique views, and an average of 100,000.

I meant what kind of value, but someone else answered that. 
---
Oh boy such spook! Well done! 
---
One thing to keep in mind - if you choose to Drink it, you can mash the Collect button and get a ton of Dirty Water that way.
---
Feel free and good luck with that. 
---
 I carry an Instigating Hardened Lever Action, it keeps the neighborhood quiet and peaceful. ;)
---
Caution:
---
I got screamed at for being a cheater for having a backpack.
---
It's just the trapper chest piece with deep pockets.  No additional weight.  I think one or more of the leather coats also comes with a backpack.  It's just cosmetic.   Pump the brakes on the Witch hunt mobile.
---
They have with the actual development of the game and the continued support, not so much with the nylon bag situation and the bans.
---
Mole miners were my go to for that and I also found a resource site and let it do my work for a few days.
---
Plasma is ballistic damage with an added energy effect right? So anti armor works on one half of the damage but not the other?
---
Thank you! Which vendors are most likely to have Heavy plans?
---
This is very apparent when I try to punch the balloons on the ground in Helvetia.
---
That's awesome. This event has made me love the game even more. Not a word spoken yet the feeling of comradery is real.
---
The thing is I will still continue playing this game. Why? Because there are no other online Fallout games, obviously. Also there are some good mentions, like map design: exteriors and interiors of this game are awesome, that's a honorable work. But those issues are just overwhelming that good factors:
---
1. **No commutication** \- Bethesda never made a good communication between developers and players. Most of communication occured was made to check the integrity of upcoming stuff related to their own gains thru Atomic Shops. 
---
2. **Code distribution mess** \- Pretty obvious things with patch accident rollbacks, fixes that just breakes the previous patch changes. Even data leaking by accidently pushing some information into the game, they didn't want to. They should learn how to manage their teamwork and use some git, finally. 
---
3. **Support Team** \- nothing to talk about, this is just not working at all. I've been posting some issues to support team since BETA, and trust me, nothing came back at me but so well-known ~~wontfix~~
---
4. **~~Miserable Content~~** ~~- people are really happy to see Fasnacht event? Seriously. This is just a single quest-like event, you have a lot of those before, it's just some new one. It feels like they made the dog starve for a week, to give it some bone after. Ofcourse it will be happy, but the we are those dogs, and this bone is a conent.~~
---
This.   Alot.
---
The Pitchfork in this photo is max level Instigating, 40% more power attack damage, 40 damage resist while power attacking. Gifted to me on my birthday by the host of the Fallout Feed Podcast!!! Very special weapon. 
---
Correct. I think it’s energy with ballistic so no idea which hits first but yes. 
---
Sounds good, me too. I'll add you rn PSN Skizzunky
---
This is something I’ve been talking with my friends about lately - all in our 40s to early 50s - are we still going to be playing games when we are 70 and how are the game developers going to have to change their games to accommodate and aging fan base? I already avoid the graphically-overwhelming, dominated by 12-yr-old twitch monkey battle royale type games, but have spent a ton of time in FO, Red Dead, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTAV, etc. I wonder how much thought about older players is already going into the dev for these kind of titles.

---
Even one piece raises you a lot. I’m currently rocking three and that’s enough for me. Most often it drops as Vanguard or Chameleon. You do need to repair it quite frequently, but it’s worth it. 
---
Why the f@#$ is every comment talking about photo mode??  Just being able to turn the camera while playing an instrument or laying in bed would be nice.  I have no use for photo mode.
---
If you have a second account dedicated to being a mule then you trade between the 2 often. There is a guy I have traded with a few times that has his main and two mule accounts because using a middle man to transfer gear between characters is shady at best. 
---
Three accounts also gives him the ability to have a trade involving 75k caps if needed. OP's story is not unbelievable when looking at the progress of the truly hard core it would be had for a detection system to judge who is cheating and who is legit.  
---
Couldn’t you just... buy some ATOMs?
---
See, here is what I think:
---
We always finish it with 5 surviving droids, right?
---
What is the Soldier, Witch, Giant and Owl ARE the rare masks, and we keep getting them because we finish with perfect results. We need to let a few droids die and finish with just one survivor and see if anything changes.
---
I ran 4 or 5 last night, no disconnects.  Maybe check your internet?
---
I've noticed this too, glad I'm not the only one. makes retaking workshops a hassle
---
Watoga, Phoenix , Harpers Ferry.  They randomly will have 0 or 1 piece of Sturdy and/or Heavy Combat Armor Plans. 
---
The game is all about trade-offs. 
---
If you're trying to match other players who've concentrated entirely on maxing out a particular aspect — e.g., the damage delivered by a particular weapon — you will necessarily have to suck at those aspects of the game which have been sacrificed in pursuit of that maxed-out stat.
---
My advice is to crank your focus back a notch or two, and to keep in mind what you're sacrificing as well as what you're maximizing. My toon isn't maxed out in anything, but it's highly capable at many things and at least moderately capable at the others, and I enjoy the game more, and obsess less, as a result.
---
Ditto. Freaking love this event. Excited to play it again tonight.
---
Ya you can re-watch it.
---
Did you put it on your rifle or your shotgun though?? Your title says shotgun but the text below says rifle. People are trying to sort out what you did and maybe that's why it's not working. And all you are giving back is bad attitude.
---
Eh, I ran 4-5 times last night, probably more tonight and every night, then a lot on weekend.  I want ALL the masks and ALL the recipes/plans!
---
If that is the case, which one will give the jester mask as a drop? I couldn't watch the video, phone is glitching out.
---
&gt;honestly i think Bethesda is doing a good job at still keeping this game alive the only reason why 
---
You have to have pretty high standards for "alive" if you really mean that. The game has few tens of thounsands of players, at least.
---
I’ve got admantum skeleton, serendipity, and fireproof, maxed strength, and HP Running full ultracite, scaly skin. I’m using a TSE minigun hitting at around 120 damage per shot, ignoring around 60ish percent of their armor.  Also got high stagger and teammates running empath. I think I can hold my own.
---
If your on PC, i can help you out with supplies, armor and weapons. I will be online in about 15 minutes. I'll let you tag along and level you up. 
---
Fast forward to 50mins
---
Yes, it is stored as a blueprint, but the likelihood of being able to replace it is quite low because there are so many issues with foundations and what they consider "floating" or flat.  If you can't place it, you can break down the blueprint into its individual parts for reassembly (so you don't need to remake workbenches, etc).
---
Basically, if you're going to move your CAMP, be prepared for the possibility of losing it.  If you get lucky, great.
---
The Sloth loot isn't the point, it's garbage usually.  The event REWARDS are what you want.
---
Yeah, same time next year. 
---
I wonder if there are certain conditions required for them to drop. All participants in masks or consuming some of the new food/drink while marching. Idk but even super rare drops would have surfaced by now
---
I can’t even finish it with 1 dead robot. 20 people in the server murdering everything in sight and all 5 always survive. 
---
White the same masks ?
---
#FOR SCIENCE!
---
Can you list this on airbnb please?
---
I'm on PC, sorry.
---
it's not wrong, but yeah, I forgot it was friggin bolted on
---
I can confirm yesterday I scrapped multiple light combat legs and got bos for its material mod slot. Been wondering this myself until it happened
---
That is awesome!!!
---
I mean, I could punch you in the face, steal your wallet, and claim it was your inability to defend yourself which facilitated the robbery in the first place.
---
Well maybe if they made cooler masks, people would actually wear them.
---
Can we murder the robots? I've played the event, but never thought to try it.
---
He has a point.
---
"videos", plural, more than one, just search Fasnacht
---
Mabey more its new every year 
---
Now that's something I can wholeheartedly agree with you on.  Getting mad about a video game is silly period (except at the game itself when it LAGS atrociously). Especially so when trying to start fights and losing.  The times I've started shit and been beaten I honestly congratulate them (privately, mostly. I don't usually hang out on area chat) because it's just a GAME. I'm not actually running around murdering people lol.
---
Honestly I don't care whether I die or my enemy dies,  as long as someone dies.
---
which that are you referring to, I wrote "plenty of videos"  meaning more than one, just search Fasnacht
---
Im usually SLAPPING people the whole time tbh. 
---
On my way!!!
---
I wouldn't mind the plane that is on the title screen. It's very close to vault 76. However I don't think this game engine can handle the draw distances from flying. 
---
Thx
---
I've had one die once, and got the same owl mask, but that could have been a fluke. I can try to do some experimenting on it in a few minutes.
---
I think it has to do with that users privacy settings. I'm on PS4 and sometimes I can see a users name when I hover over their camp object and other times I cant. I had previously thought they had to be on your friend list to see the name, but I found 2 camps just yesterday who were randoms but I could see their name. And couple times I have been able to rejoin a server using the recent tab, but 80% of the time the option is greyed out.
---
So idk for sure whats up.
---
Lmao right. I'd stick with power armor. You can get in and out of it without a pit crew
---
Same server?
---
Simply having copious amounts of duped materials is a bannable offense
---
Does the person that killed them still get caps though?
---
I've never heard another player speak. I've considered plugging in my mic, but so far it seems like I'd be talking into a void.
---
I’m 99% certain this isn’t true.  Instead you likely learned the BOS mod for the Combat Helmet.  It pops up as BOS when you scrap any Combat Armor piece and makes people think they learned a BOS mod for armor when in reality it is just the paint for the helmet.  
---
No. I accidentally vats shit one and it didn’t hurt it.

---
wanna buy Soldier Mask, it is ultra rare, everyone wants it. One offered me 10 000 caps and I said no. Price for you today, only 2000 caps.
---
Im may not be the best of help but i have tse that ill unload at the queen. 
---
What about allowing item for item trades?  Trading with players is garbage without it.
---
that and the "hidden" icon takes forever to pop up. as a stealth build this is frustrating af.
---
Message me on XBL, and I will check, I believe I have a couple extras.
---
Plural indeed... thanks for your input, it was of great value. 
---
 I didn't push any character out of the way, nor did I glitch my way into your camp. I simply opened a door, walked up to a bag you dropped, and took it. It's your own fault, Paulie. That's a risk you take when you drop things.
---
Hell, I've had people do it to me with far better stuff and I have never acted the way you did you big baby boomer.
---
&gt;It's just a game, and the items you took are not that important
---
Yet you harass me over xbox for them, and then when I don't respond, you find me on reddit?
---
Had you asked nicely I would have given you your crap back. The plans were indeed garbage. 
---
It's an annoying bug, yup. 
---
But you don't want a turret on the ground anyway: magnets for low-level melee mobs.
---
I've completed with with dead robots (2 dead and 1 dead) a couple times and got the usual masks. Not saying this is wrong but if it's true the loot pools may overlap a bit.
---
The sloth has bugged out after death on 80 percent of the parades I completed. It dies, then just floats there unable to be targeted. Happened in 3 of the 4 I did yesterday.
---
I'll help, but not sure when I'll be on next.
---
PSN - chakra_bender 
---
Sorry to hear that. Let's hope bethesda fix game quickly.
---
it might be inflated, but Bethesda said back in early December that they had millions of active users that was also a time when the game was in a dark place. there are almost 200k people subscribed to this sub alone and it is extremely unlikely that those users make up a majority of the player base, or even 1/5 of the player base. regardless of the exact numbers, the number is big enough to have seen some kind of evidence, and we have yet to see any.
---
Lol this could also be true. I already had it on the legs I was wearing from picking them up from taggerty in the glassed cavern. Please completely disregard my post. Didn't bother to make anything to check. Now I'm sad I lack bos
---
Well said and I tottaly agree with you. The thing that annoys me the most is how people are farming the event and server hopping over and over again... then they just stand in the event area afk and get rewarded for doing nothing! I was expecting the event to be challenging like a queen fight where people have to join forces to achieve something and get rewarded for winning not hanging out and server jumping. Zzzz boring...
---
Do u still have the gatling plan? Xbox 
---
I'd be interested in buying it off you
---
You can do it every hour. The hour starts as the first event begins.
---
You call it a bug, I call it fore shadowing 😏
---
I don't ever hear them say in the video that there is a different loot pool for every outcome. Is that your interpretation of what they said?
---
It would be better to quote what they actually say, and then let everyone come to their own conclusion.
---
Also, your interpretation (?) of what was said in the stream is not supported by the game data.
---
It's a good thing plans aren't random anymore....smh.
---
That's why IMO it's standard protocol for higher levels to look out for lower levels in this area. If I warp into a lower zone, and cause all the enemies to shoot up to my level, I fully expect you to open mic flip shit on me if I don't help you and cause you to die.
---
In all honesty though, a large majority of this community is super helpful, and will do small things to help lower level characters. Pro-tip, if a higher level stops attacking a high level enemy (especially a legendary), and looks at you or something, they're probably waiting for you to tag it for XP and teh loots.
---
Problem solved! 😂 
---
*doubt*
---
No bug, the overseeres quest is an evolving quest, your next stop should be in Morgan town i believe. Im level 80 and i still have it, im thinking there will be more content eventually.
---
Don't worry about overseers mission, you will find it along the way as you adventure. Good luck out there. 
---
Or boom trading with a stranger 😆 
---
Nuke Helvetia you say?
---
So it’s impossible to get the masks right now?
---
I got two shotted by a lvl 50 dude that I assume was decked out with assasins/sentinel build as I inflicted very little damage and I have a full modded T60 PA build with heavy dmg resistance.  I’m almost a lvl 150 and have legendary explosive shotgun build completely perked out and he took 3-4 shots and was still standing. I don’t think so.  I can drop a sentry bot in 3-4 shots easy.  I can decimate any super mutant in 2 shots.   I know people hate to hear the “nerf” word but they did it with TSEs so they need to adjust or level accordingly. 
---
Or, as is the problem with RNG, you don't know how it works.
---
Omg guys,  rare might mean rare.
---
I deleted my interpretation. Watch the video and decide for yourself. Sorry for the confusion. 
---
:newsflash:
---
Not all of the masks are rare. But I'm sure some of them are. 
---
Hell given how probabilities work there has to be few players who did it only few times and every time got a really rare mask.
---
&gt;Also I can see the reason why it's something that will only be around for a week. It takes at least 2-3 people to barely beat the mission unless you show up RIGHT as the event starts. With only 20 some odd people per map (assuming your map is full, 24), if only half or less of the population show up, it's going to be tough to keep repeating it over and over again.
---
I really don't understand what you said there? What is exactly is though? The event starts right when the cooldown timer stops. Im fairly sure one single player could do it alone. And given how long the event takes to complete, you can join it anytime it's started. The masks are given only at the end, with no rewards for immediate tasks, so it's really hard to miss.
---
Are you the same dataminer who said the lunch boxes were coming? And how this game was pay to win?
---
I think planes would be too much. Map is too small for a speed of plane. A lot slower vehicles like cars and bikes would be good in my opinion. There also questions like:
---
-how big it have to be?
---
-how much fuel or energy from cores will it take in an ingame hour
---
-it would be overpowered (fir a vehicle) to have such a big speed for a medium size map (this map sure is too big for walking on foot but too small for flying vehicles in my opinion)
---
-how much weight plane will be able to carry (including mass of player's backpack)
---
Since Swiss are neutral I don't really see the point.
---
As far as I can tell. Unless provided with proof otherwise I have to assume that the 'rare chance' is not supposed to be a 1.
---
Should be .85 usually.
---
Ive found intestines on things far away from Helvita. You could farm flatwoods or something before fast traveling up there
---
This dude doesn't think of you the same way you think of him.
---
You're not his friend. Not in his opinion.
---
What system you on?
---
Nope but that excited me wow
---
Oh you're that guy
---
looks like more of a workshop than a camp. That thing is massive!
---
U mean Fertile soil? It pops op almost every time i visit Flatwoods. U have to kill 3 bots and a bunch of eyebots. The bots are always marked on the map.  Finishing the quest rewards you with some items. 
---
Oh no... what have you done?  This is too catchy....
---
Did you report it?
---
Once you craft the excavator armor, you register it to complete the quest and you'll get your power armor station plan in the rewards.
---
You could, and it would be technically correct, but that's not really the same thing. 
---
In the case of the duping problem, it was the server instability and latency that *caused* desync between the server and the client to such a degree that it triggered  the duping bug. The first dupers would have discovered this quite by accident, after which of course it became a known and well-used exploit.
---
I was a little surprised nobody mentioned the garage in front of Blackwater mine I've seen lvl 15 there.
---
Every run with a strange new crew was a laugh, I don't say a peep, but oh my goodness, a laugh and a half haha. You beautiful weird birds. 
---
It's not griefing if it is making my game experience better. 
---
He did the same with our parade, there was a line qued up behind him. Lol
---
Nope, I'm the one who found the quantum armor paint a couple days ago.
---
Have you actually tested this? 
---
How do you know he didn't want to do mutual agreed PvP?
---
How do you know he was a kid if he didn't use mic?
---
Visual bug! 
---
Seems to be a bit wonky in 1st person. Use third, it’s better for PvP anyhow.
---
sorry you had such high expectations from a fucking stranger on the fucking internet, ass...
---
Those words probably mean something that are intended to humble me for the comment that *I* made...
---
You'd best believe I'm feeling it!
---
The perk card system can seem daunting/weird at first. A tip that blew my mind, and apparently others so I didn't feel as dumb, was when you level, and pick a SPECIAL, you DO NOT need to take a card from that selected special. IE: you can put a point in say STR, but select a card from say INT. 
---
Not sure how it's listed on PS4 (I'm on PC), but there's a way to cycle through the different special card listings, should be listed what button at the bottom of your screen.
---
u/Valseek
---
I’ve tried but nobody ever lets any die when I do the event. I’ll add this to the main post so it doesn’t keep getting asked. 
---
Loud n proud!
---
#🎉
---
No threats, it's just a game, and if you didn't think you had done anything wrong, why did you log out &amp; block me so quickly, before I ever sent you a message.
---
Ill be honest, I dont even have a forum account, and it seems the easiest way to get things fixed is public attention rather than a report.
---
Why is it not surprising that yet another community misunderstands RNG?
---
"I've ran this 20 times, and seen 20 people run it each time, and no rare shit?!"

I have done it about 70 times
---
Dear oh dear, the salt is radiating from you... Jesus loves you. 
---
I've taken to building death trap camps. Fills the time haha
---
A long time ago someone posted a video of the armor in which speak of on this reddit. Whether or not that post is still somewhere in this reddit is  me though.
---
Because is the DMV. And yes,  I've started that quest 3 times on my current alt.
---
I would also like an inspect character. I want to see what my friends gear is instead of having to voice chat constantly/them opening their menu and reading stats so we can quick co.pare and trade faster
---
Doesn't matter.
---
RNG isn't cumulative.
---
Exactly my reaction, where the heck did this get promoted 
---
You've got to be pretty durn quick to get the stuff mid-splurt.
---
I'm not 100% sure how explosives work, but scorchbeast sonic attacks may count as energy after they've had the explosive reduction applied. If you're running Dense + 3x Fireproof then it's not going to matter, but otherwise you may want to throw in a piece of leather with the heavy metal.
---
&gt;So (0.0 through 1.0) &lt;= 1 means its impossible to receive those masks without the random number rolling a 1. 
---
fucking knew it. it is borderline statistically impossible for us to have had over 24 hours with this event with no evidence of any of those masks.
---
hopefully this post gets the traction it deserves and notice from u/ladydevann, u/valseek, u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/BethesdaGameStudios_ seeing as a Bethesda dev was "confirming" that these masks were obtainable during their recent stream.
---
thanks so much for this.
---
Great info. Matt from Bethesda said it a bit different on twitch today but maybe he doesn’t quite know how it works himself?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/akvw5f/has_anyone_found_the_raider_power_armor_random/
---
Yeah but nobody else has gotten those masks. Something is wrong 
---
you don't know what datamining is do you?
---
with a can o' beans a-cooking!  
---
Yes, something is wrong. Actually,  someone is wrong.
---
You.
---
I’ve got close to 35 runs with none of those masks. I would say they aren’t dropping.
---
also need a working toilet, my character hasnt gone poop since this game started
---
This spot worked like a charm! Thanks!
---
This is exactly why Fallout 76 needs a Test Server as well as a way for knowledgeable and dedicated fans to interact directly with the devs, rather than having to jump up and down waving our hands in the air (Fallout 76 emote style) to try to get their attention when we believe there may be a critical issue after an update or a content launch.
---
Is there any different % chance on the recipes, plans and beret? (Like are balloons less likely to drop than pole lantern?) Thanks.
---
umm...  first, I'm not your fucking mom, find it yourself, second I have hundreds of videos in my history, third, go fuck yourself asshole.
---
I was there too.  Lol.  It was pretty cool to see them all.  👍
---
Agreed but I don't think this has to be a issue for 76 since it's not a competitive fps or anything. But some of the mechanics are cheap (or feel becsause not knowing the counterplay). I do enjoy the theory crafting etc wit hcards and legendary effect. Since outside of the queen fight ther is a lot of playing space, no need to min/max damage for all the content.
---
PS4 unfortunately.....
---
Every critter in the game drops intestines.  Flatwoods area is full of them.  You don't have to gather them from Helvetia.
---
1:set up camp by the overseer’s camp
---
2: if you see an event called Wolf Pack: The forest, do it. It gets you 3 legendaries every time for fighting 15 wolves.
---
3: Always pick up all the meat you find. Food is important
---
4: same with water. Collect dirty water and wood, then boil and cook
---
5: get a tinker’s workbench. It let’s you craft ammo.
---
6: try to team up with very high level players. That can take you to places like the white spring where you can get really good loot/experience
---
7: death has no penalty. Don’t be scared to die.
---
8: make sure you have an ample supply of weapons. They break faster than you think
---
9: don’t be scared to explore areas far away from vault 76. The toxic valley and cranberry bog are great for experience, though you may die a lot
---
10: don’t be scared to fight a higher level enemy
---
11: claim workshop. They are very useful. Just right of vault 76 is a workshop.
---
12: get a power armor frame. Just the frame gives great bonuses, especially for low-levels.
---
13: trade with other players. You can negotiate deals for junk, ammo, or weapons you might need
---
14: sell or scrap unwanted items
---
15: when your AP is almost up while running, jump. You will gain a bit more distance
---
And finally: remember, it’s just a game
---
Well you agreed I’m right so... I’m right
---
Why? Hmmm. They have the problem with someone wanting to help  them? If they dont want help, fine,  jump servers. What's that do to them? Nothing, in a few seconds they load into another server without the helpful player annoying them... how can anyone know if someone wants or needs stuff? Why create an emote that can be easily misinterpreted as well.... heres some purified water, no thank you emote...oh...okay heres some dog food...no thank you emote...oh...heres some .308 rounds...no thank you emote... save yourself some grief, jump servers... 
---
Actually I knew someone from the Netherlands whose name was Hermoine and she pronounced it Her-MEEN.
---
I was waiting to see if any more info came out during the stream, it could be an accident and that variable was supposed to be changed once the event went live.
---
Either way it needs to be pointed out, especially given the fact that we have no *proof* that anyone has obtained any of those 5 masks. If someone can come out with those masks being legitimately obtained, I will fully retract my statement.
---
But given that a group I play with did ~20ish runs as a group of 4 means that out of 80 chances nobody got a single 'rare' mask, It points more to a bug in the code.
---
If that's what you need to tell yourself, beat yourself up.
---
but I’m right
---
I didn't log out. I swapped servers. 
---
I blocked you after you sent me two harassing messages.

Where is the house that u had to got too?
---
Helen's daughter, or the fizzy-haired girl from that book?
---
It is not a bug, it is an exploit. The server rolls back some actions when things get fucky. From my understanding, dupers stress the servers, cause lag, and trigger the roll back in order to protect items that could have been lost due to server instability. They are exploiting how the servers work, not using a bug. 
---
It is not Bethesdas fault when someone starts cheating or exploiting the system. No one has ever been able to create a bug-free, inexploitable videogame. Name one game where people have tried and failed. It was the dupers fault for why reviewers were bashing 76 server stability. Bethesda reported that server stability tripled once dupers were banned.
---
Daily quests seem to be messed up since Patch 7.  I have not been able to get _any_ of them to trigger.
---
I finally used the floating foundation trick to keep them from destroying my base. Threw a missle turret in there just for fun.
---
No, the low-high chance all have a 100% chance of getting a recipe. The recipe is randomly selected from the list, there does not seem to be a rarity included inside the list itself. No one item is considered more rare than the others.
---
Wow, a double reference. 
---
Interesting to see all the different age groups. I'm 20 and just started playing. Just hit level 12 today
---
Go to the back of the line.  😉
---
I should confirm this issue still exists today. I killed the yegau or whatever it’s called and logged off. I logged back in today and it’s gone along with the rest of the quest. However, log out and In again and it’s back.
---
SMH Just like real life. I just bought the Dark Wood Laminate Floor and it's going on sale! 
---
You're objectively incorrect.
---
It's moot, you thinking you're right won't change how RNG actually works, versus how you think it does or want it to.
---
Have fun.
---
Well dont think it was much of a bait and switch, repairs are simple and easy as anyone can tell ya. The only thing you accomplish by destroying a camp is like being the annoying fly at a summer bbq, youre there we know youre there but its not gonna ruin our day as much as you may try buzzin our ear.
---
I seriously doubt anyone has ever sat at the keyboard or controller and cried because a raider/griefer rolled by. Much as they may have hoped that happened.
---
Sweet. You making a stronger? Highly suggest it if you're not. 
---
Ah cool!
---
I thought that but with all the one shot builds running around no amount of tanking is going stop me from spilling my guts out. 
---
I’ve encountered several 2-3* starred wood pieces before. This before I was told they “arent” in game. So I have no idea. 
---
I’ll hunt around and see what I find. 
---
I think I saw your C.A.M.P. yesterday and was confused why a location marker wasn't popping up at first. Are you on PC? This is great work.
---
are you saying balloons are the only thing that pop?
---
okay, this is epic
---
That’s the way the DMV works IRL, so why should it be different in-game?  😉
---
It’s impossible for a game this big to have 0 people get the rare masks
---
I've seen some ticks pop. Not pleasant but it happens
---
Ps4, did the first quest @ camden and tested all the games yesterday without issues.
---
If your having issues getting the daily quest to pop after, sometimes it helps to fast travel near the park and it will often pop for me.
---
How much did that skin cost?
---
delete this post before the end of the day so they do not fix this issue ahhhh
---
Damn. Five more Scorchbeasts - all empty. Not a single item. Not a meat piece. Nothing. Well, one more reason to not make opinions too early...
---
several missions don't checkpoint even though there is a clear message saying "checkpointed" in the corner of the screen...
---
Can we get an extension for the event too.
---
I was banned for selling organic legendaries for a lot of grape nuka. I tried to avoid caps limit. So you can be banned for buying suspiciously huge amount of items, especially ammo
---
I tired to let some die, but it’s hard to convince others to. 
---
Wow didn't expect the thread to take off like this, just wanted to give everyone a heads up. Thank you to everyone for the wonderful feedback! Also this was on PS4, but from other feeds it appears this is an issue across all platforms. I hope everyone is having fun with the event!
---
Im on  PC and i just treat people how i want to be treated 
---
It worked in fallout new vegas.
---
You can tame cats, you know.
---
3 Level Animal Friend
---
800 atoms
---
I mean I don’t lose all my documentation and applications as soon as I leave the DMV though x_x
---
I've played the event close to 50 times now and have yet to receive the jester mask, the sun mask, the blue old mask or the goblin mask. Many have guessed that they will be releasing these later throughout the DLC. Either way, I'll keep doing the event.
---
I know what you re going to think but, seriously...
---
"It just works™ "
---
I will forever be mad at myself for missing out on the mosaic tile floor plan.  I never logged on when it was up for sale.  Damn you Atom Shop!!
---
You're a walking tank man!
---
I hope they fix this, or at least let us know that our progress hasn’t actually been saved.
---
[Datamined info](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer_here_list_of_all_fasnacht_rewards_and/) Regarding the drops rates.
---
That part about the mods working for any tier - light, sturdy, or heavy - is not holding true for my playthrough. Mods are being tied to tier for combat armor, I know. I didn't pay attention for leather, but now that I can craft polymer arms in light but not heavy, I'm paying attention.
---
Also, BOS combat armor plans drop from treasure maps. 
---
Well, according to probability theory, the probability of rolling exactly 1 on a uniform distribution is exactly 0, so we are pretty much fucked, I guess.
---
Yes, and they involve scorchbeasts, unfortunately. Don't know if you're doing recruitment blues for Brotherhood or Enclave; if you're doing Brotherhood it's the next quest up, **Belly of the Beast**. It's going to be frustrating as hell, but DO NOT quit to main menu when the scorchbeasts show up. Fight or stealth boy your way through or you'll have to start over. All five transponders have to be activated in the same session on the same server.
---
Yeah my thoughts as I am lvl 70 and budget maxes out at half that size.
---
Wtf dude. Come on.
---
Monongah
---
You re one of those....jk PS4, I appreciate the reply
---
Hey, this is incorrect. Someone datamined it and your info is wrong. I get the steam said something different, but the actual data doesn’t lie. 
---
up-vote the shit out of this post folks...
---
Yeah. Swapping after this nuke 
---
I’ll check it out, I’ll do a few server hops if I don’t get it off the bat
---
Considering that our age group is large and generally solvent (in money), there should be money in it for the developers. We are the last generation to get pensions so they should strike while the iron is hot.
---
3 more rounds after this one bro! 
---
Or just spam tag the devs ;)
---
ya you can
---
Nice bro
---
What audio settings do you use to "talk" to others?  Do you first team up?  I bought a headset/mic for this game (first time since *original xbox* came out that I'm using one), and despite having it, have never heard another human voice except my own breathing...

Are you launching another nuke? My BE 50 cal is amazing against the queen if you need extra help
---
Your a dumb dumb 
---
That's odd. Where's alex?
---
He's basically a traveling vendor. He's a super mutant with a brahim loaded with goods. He travels the whole map to my knowledge. And he's a pretty funny dude.
---
Me too
---
I didnt get anything from the queen....
---
They were exploiting a bug -- it can't have been fixed if it wasn't broken to begin with. Duping would still be a problem, despite the bans, if Bethesda hadn't fixed, or in the case of stability improved, the underlying issue. 
---
Not sure where you dragged out the rest of that mess; it's not something I was arguing. Sounds like you're a little sensitive about the topic. 
---
What we lose in reflexes we gain in experience, patience, and planning ability.  FPSers may not be the best showcase for it, but even then with some map memorization and advance strategy you can still make the kids get off your lawn in a hurry.
---
I was just trying to help 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m glad someone datamined the correct info. This isn’t “my” info, I was just sharing what Bethesda said themselves about loot drops for the parade event. 
---
I love the mixed use of different materials! My own base has a red rocket gas station made out of metal plates and then a farmhouse-style over a waterfall.
---
Again, part of the reason that resource production is so low right now is because there are no resource sinks. It would be a play balance issue. There's no reason to think availability of resources would stay constant with the implementation of such a system.   
---
Let me ask you this: if they were able to balance the resource supply...   
---
Would you not have fun engaging in elaborate siege warfare over workshops? Epic battles involves multiple teams of players? Even if it was specifically on faction warfare servers (like the upcoming survival mode)? I think a ton of people would enjoy that. 
---
You know what you did.
---
Winertman does exist I’ve seen a person on fb with it 
---
Working.
---
Agree that somebody would at least have a screenshot of a random wearing one
---
Well your DMV must be nicer than the rest of ours'.  ;)
---
wait, did you mean to say "de-briefed"? like, they stole your tidy-whities?
---
Solid logic.
---
Not.
---
Sounds like you had a workshop. Which enables pvp
---
Yeah we are launch 3 more after this one! That’s the same gun I use! If you want to jump in carry on, may be a queue though as servers get full quick! She’s taking less than 10mins to kill every fight m! 
---
There’s something a bit ironic about blowing up someone’s base as revenge and eating a big bounty as a result.  Had a similar situation and it was 300 caps for me at that time but it was well worth it.  
---
Me to lol 
---
It's the DMV.  It's SUPPOSED to be infuriating.
---
Your a dumb dumb
---
And again, this is the kind of thing that the community has been saying. "ive seen" ,"i know someone", "my best friends sister". And yet a severe lack of any actual proof.
---
Yes im on PC that would be greatly  appreciated  thank you
---
Maybe it varies by mod... but I don't think so.  In my experience you learn mods specifically for pieces (Limbs, Arms, Legs, Torso, etc.) but the tiers are the same.
---
Deep Pocketed Combat Chest Mod plan will give you the deep pocketed for the Light, Sturdy, and Heavy.  BOS Combat Chest will give you the BOS Mod for Light, Sturdy, and Heavy.
---
So they are segregated by piece (Arm, Leg, sometimes combined as Limb depending on mod, and Torso).  But they are not segregated by Tier (Light, Sturdy, Heavy).
---
Haha bethesda duped you into thinking they were going to let you get away with it. 
---
#Dupebag
---
I bought a rubber ball from a friend all my caps then he killed me then I got my caps back by selling it back to him afterwards.
---
You took a workshop, he or a buddy contested it opening PVP with you, and he killed you.
---
Stop taking workshops if you want to avoid players killing you. A pacifist is someone who does not harm others. There is nothing in life stopping others from harming a pacifist.
---
Learn to spell, after you learn how RNG works, failtroll.

What everyone else said below + if you find certain spots there’s little wood piles you can build base at. There’s a really nice one in the mire

Definitely good to know thanks.

Couldn’t hope for a more comprehensive answer thank you. 
---
&gt;	some dragon
---
Oh boy, get used to those. 
---
Early on you can run away, later on they’re just kind of a slog. But it doesn’t mess with the enjoyment of the game. 
---
Maybe but I got the beret today.
---
I live in Hurricane and I've had people from customer service places ask me if we get lots of hurricanes here.
---
I'm like, no, WV is completely land locked lol Also....hurricun.
---
I love WV. 
---
Oh nice! I guess im a lil behind lol
---
you should be able to link the photo then,
---
My girlfriend asked me if it was named after a hurricane that hit... when the closest ocean is ~8 hours away 
---
I wil admit I do not know the full/intricate details of the event, nor do I know how many masks there are in total, so my outlook is very simplistic.
---
I interpret "limited time seasonal event" as "the event will only run for a short time, and won't be back again until this time next year"
---
That makes all the masks, regardless of variety, limited (2019) editions.
---
(Think craft beer - the brewer has a base recipie, makes a limited edition run.  On sale for 2 weeks only, then gone forever.  The following year, tweak the recipie, sell for 2 weeks, lather rinse, repeat)
---
Back to FO - For the sake of easy math, say the event is 7 days, and there are 23 different masks.  
---
One is already in the wild (the man mask) - how many of them is anyones guess - I've only seen 2, and I have one of them.  
---
Another mask is in the store.  That leaves 21. 
---
21 masks over 7 days, drop 3 different masks each day.  
---
That makes the logic behind my question:
---
Since what will be dropped later this week is unknown, on day 2, how do you know whats rare (or not)?
---
Rarity wil be difficult to accurately determined until later in the week.
---
Secondary consideration:
---
How many people do you know will pay for an item that may drop (free) in an event?
---
Then from a make money point of view, targeting the people that \*must\* have a complete set of (2019) masks - drop them over the course of the event duration, except the one already in the wild and the one put in the store just ahead of the event.  Player must find one and buy one (atoms or real money) to obtain a complete set.
---
You my friend are my Hero for today!!!!!
---
I haven't spend a single point in Charisma so far because I just play alone but well I guess now I have to thank you very much &lt;3
---
Your welcome, what's your IGN? 
---
I got a little bit of flak for not announcing the source of the data, figured Id do my best to avoid that this time :)
---
Hey there! We had a stream today where we talked to Dev's who worked on this event and one things they mentioned that you may be interested in, is that different masks drop depending on how many robots survive (or don't survive) [Here is the link if you'd like to watch.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/398445300) 
---
Right hahaha always makes me chuckle 
---
Wish I could - I was one of the many “suspended” accounts, and I was able to get back in and play for that past week, but as of yesterday’s update - I am not able to sign in again....
---
It's one thing ray tracing would fix but it's actually a mathematically difficult problem in games where the lighting can't be pre-computed. 
---
No, I was doing the new event thing
---
I miss alot more now as well when meleeing. That being said, I wonder if it is the hitting with no dmg bug or if it is lag and I am swinging where a monster looks to be when it is not. 
---
What?
---
No, I didn’t.
---
What’s the matter? Can’t you join? 
---
Nope, he is coming in May.
---
Have you talked to the Master of Ceremonies, he’ll tell you if it won’t start on that session
---
It's on a 1 hour timer after the last time it starts.  So there appears to be a few minutes variance depending on how long into that 4 minute start countdown you actually talk to the Master of Ceremonies.
---
Last night the event was starting about 20 minutes til the hour, so I just made sure to go to Helvetia at X:35 and wait around for it to spawn.  Killing a few scorched that showed up and gathering wood, eggs, intestines, and Stiens in advance.
---
In England, we would call this an "own goal". 
---
Good thing this ain’t real life then right
---
The currently prepping/not ready line? I assumed that meant the hour timer wasn’t up 
---
Enclave questline, go to the nuclear waste dump cave in the mire and complete the quest Bunker Buster, it has a couple deathclaws inside guarding the entrance elevator so get animal friend or use a stealth boy. After that go through the bunker and at the end there is a holotape mentioning the whitesprings bunker and the key card you pick up during the quest allows access.
---
Yeah that excavator armor is nearly indestructible for me too. I just fixed the legs on mine for the first time since I got it at level 27. I'm level 102. Granted, I only use it in nuke zones and the occasional scrap run. Maybe mods effect the durability? I've only ever had motion assist servos on mine (up till this morning when I changed it over to a "core assembly".
---
E
---
Following you again. Hopefully get something off the queen this time. I got nothing in the last 1. 
---
i dont speak english very good, what means bulk? any youutbe guide? 
---
Great. Add to this to the ridiculous number of "Disconnected from Server" drops during the quest and this has to be considered another bust.
---
mmm dat efficient summary, thank you. Hahaha, This is the datamining I can get behind. Not spoiling an unmarked puzzle quest, lol. 
---
Indeed
---
The only way for someone to kill you in one hit is for you to be in PVP.  Which happens if you own a Workshop (or someone on your team did and they left the game, transferring it to you).  Or if you strike them back after they hit you (but the first hit will just be a small amount of "Slap" damage).
---
Briefed? On what are they briefing you on? Is it a need to know thingy...? 
---
Well, to be honest, having a healthy dose of ze german blood in me im probably a wee bit biassed too :P
---
Just keep shooting it dude that’s all I can advise! Swapping servers after this fight! 
---
Youd be surprised, im a raider. People get vocal about it. Especially in game over the mic
---
Look at my post history.. 
---
I’m wondering why OP has his inventory blurred out. Whatcha hiding in there? 
---
I am now give me 1 min
---
I like it. I don't use it but I like it enough to waste 10 pounds of stash on it.
---
So maybe we need more testing with a certain number of robots dying. May be worth a try since the devs have hinted at it. 
---
helps if you put what platform your on
---
You can’t help but trip over wood in the forest 
---
I "dragged out the rest of that mess" to illustrate the point that reviewers we're unusually extra critical of FO76 for things out of their control. No developer can foresee problems that will arise as a result of the playerbase actively trying to break their game. Reviewers shit on 76 for something not directly Bethesdas fault. Servers sucked at launch because of the duping problem. Dupers get banned, one method gets fixed, and servers are now "better".
---
Why isn't this a thing yet
---
Ya, he just says that when ever the 1 hour timer isn't up.  I've had him say it when I talk to him and then a few seconds later the event starts and I talk to him again to start it.
---
I did two parades. First mask i got was a witch mask, second one was an owl. Really hoping for a Jester.
---
Funky house~
---
Are you'll PS4 cuss I swear I came across this place yesterday or the day before.
---
Yeah i got alot of hits in but got no loot when she dropped
---
There’s always money in the banana stand 
---
Love the parade but would be even better with a Fasnacht photoframe!
---
As far as I can tell, I've only ever dropped junk. Nothing else.
---
As I mentioned in the post, the loot tables dont change when robots are dead, just the chance of getting a mask from the mask loot table.
---
pvp gear, didn't want others to know which build and gear i use since i mostly play pvp. that's why i blured his out aswell, i always do that in all games.
---
Hopefully you do this time! 
---
He was being briefed on how PVP works in this game :)
---
Like when you throw your kid in the deep end to teach them how to swim.
---
You need to work on your caps. It doesn't cost much for a good one-star lever or handmade rifle. A couple of hours a day gets you 1400 caps.
---
Solo is generally the easy bit for a rifle build, especially with an instigating lever or hunting rifle. Crouch, shoot stuff in the head and it dies. The extra stealth damage perks are overkill, and I never bothered with them.
---
The SBQ is a very different problem, because you don't get sneak attack bonuses when there are other non-stealth players nearby. An instigating lever rifle is still handy for clearing the mobs, but there's no substitute for DPM against the bigger stuff. What you want there is a handmade rifle with Anti-armor, Furious or preferably Bloodied. Chuck on the 35-round magazine for a good balance between extra damage and fire rate. 
---
Unless you're running a VATS crit build, throw on every damage perk you can get: Bloody Mess, Tank Killer, at least one point in Adrenaline. Probably Tenderizer although it's undocumented. Adrenal Reaction mutation if suitable. When the queen lands, spam it in the head once you've picked the mobs off the melee guys.
---
I don’t know what in what I said prompted such a deep analysis of the event nor do I think it was necessary, but you seem to of worked very hard so kudos to you I guess
---
Yes, melee just started freezing on me about 10% of the time since the last patch. This is new behavior- I've always thought melee worked perfectly until now.
---
So what you’re telling me is that if 10 people are killing a huge sloth, I accidentally shoot someone who is over 150 levels above me and then he can just kill me in one hit forever?
---
All day every day. It's like Morrowind's diceroll combat all over again
---
I'm sorry. 
---
I like your optimism 😂
---
You are so helpful, this changes everything. I can finally stop grinding this quest! +karma
---
Platform? I have hanging ribbons on PS 
---
If i had more time I'd help you out, and as it is a pack of wolves are RP'ng as wasteland po po's hunting me down like a bloodied rabbit XD. But if i see you I'll drop you off some gear if you need em. 
---
is there a question?
---
How do you do that I’m new to reddit 
---
No. It was never as awful as people said. 
---
Just watch out when you try taming Deathclaws....
---
PS4 adding you now
---
Lol. Nice!
---
I meant to say grieffed, it was the autocorrect
---
"They're all available now" according to the Bethesda Twitch stream. All masks are available but occupy 'different rarity pools'. 
---
No in an event you cant hurt people in the event area 
---
you see he has his as item in the inventory? with stat's and additional carry weight? did you even read the thread?
---
Whoops wrong place lol
---
remove the foundation / floor is was standing on and will pop right back under your "stored" tab, it's a known bug, happen to me a lot of times.
---
If it's a bas foundation you can probably not remove it, that is why i always ace my turret on a round table if it on the base foundation, just a tip...
---
Unless you have pacifist mode turned on.  Which will stop you from damaging players and stop you for unintentionally starting PVP.
---
But pacifist mode will not stop owning a workshop from placing you into PVP mode.  All it will do then is stop you from defending yourself as you will deal zero damage to other players.
---
In my experience anyone that PvPs a lot can usually figure that out pretty quick on their own once they tangle with you. But then again not everyone pvps a lot. 
---
Then??????? What happened. I literally started playing 2 days ago basically
---
Does Zenimax Media pay you per hour or per nice guy harrassed?
---
XB1 but i don't see why that would make a  difference
---
You're using sneak AND PA at the same time?  
---
It’s worth what someone is willing to pay. Supply and demand...
---
sorta, since i am in an multi gaming clan where 300+ player in more then 30 games are we have to use teamspeak.
---
Not your fault, most of our info on the drop tables has been sketchy at best. Thanks regardless though! I'm still looking forward to getting that Jester mask!
---
Servers sucked at launch because servers always suck at launch. Anyone who gave them crap for load issues was/is clearly inexperienced with game launches -- I've never said otherwise. 
---
But how those servers handled desync? Demonstrably unacceptable; shown by Bethesda's own efforts to address the issue. As I said, the dupers are hardly blameless in this, but they pulled it off by exploiting an issue that should never have made it into production. 
---
Link the screenshot?

Beeswax too apparently. So if you server hop in helvetia at the honey haus you can get tons

Said Michael bluth

Jackpot.

Yeah, since the last update I've been able to decorate my shack to reflect the role of my character.

I would say its possible. I dont think any info is out about future DLC.  So anythings possible

FYI never hold a lighter under a full tick irl

Yeah. It’s where the president would go in our world in the event of Nuclear war. But Fallouts president went to the Oil Rig so I’m not sure who would be there, but yeah it’s a real place.
---
Thanks for lookin out, I have a pretty good power leveling method it just requires a stupid amount of junk.
---
I peed my pod. Can I get a new pod?
---
Glitch, bug, you arent telling the whole story, or you are just lying.  I wasnt there and you have no video evidence so I cant say. All I know is how pvp works in this game and unless you are walking around with 1 hp it is impossible now for anyone no matter what level they are to kill you in one hit if you are not engaged in pvp
---
hopefully this post gets the traction it deserves and notice from u/ladydevann, u/valseek, u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/BethesdaGameStudios_ seeing as a Bethesda dev was "confirming" that these masks were obtainable during their recent stream. 
---
I'm talking about regular players like me that have items that*look*Like the upcoming backpacks.  Getting yelled at for being a cheater because of guys like this.
---
Maybe re read my comment?
---
That's not the only reason why people are still saying that... 
---
There are still numerous legitimate complaints regarding the game and it is still not in a completed state. 
---
I just work on my camp until it starts
---
Everything in your junk tab, most of tge time tge person doesnt even take it though unless theyre low low levels
---
Yeah I’ve had all of them survive but get junk
---
Pretty sure you can if he didn't have pacifist mode on
---
Also lvl 15 armor in the West Bridge entrance. The key is on a poor sop riding the roller coaster at Camden park
---
Know what else is pretty stupid? Babies who get on here and whine about other players using in game mechanics that you don’t agree with. Grow up and move on. Server hop w/e but don’t force us to listen to this baby nonsense. 
---
I thought that was what the bunker where the enclave is is for?
---
I already spent half my playtime in my camp working on it
---
ty I added it to the list.
---
Basically everyone is  a griefer These days it seems... People really dont know what griefing is 
---
Lol I am not suicidal :D
---
A boy can dream 😁 reality is over rated.
---
I never have pacifist on and cant start pvp in events
---
Aww mate that sucks I hope they sort it out soon. All the best and hopefully see you in game one day. 
---
I feel like this needs to work so you can fight higher leveled enemies during the event. They should make creatures there be immune to the radiation for the event.
---
Guess i'll be the realist here...
---
First off
---
* Don't expect it to be anywhere near a classical fallout game. The story and quests are it's weak part. If i had to compare it to something, it's probably closest to a propperly calibrated Fo4 endgame on survival mode (meaning that you can actually take a hit playing melee while beein unable to 1shot everything with a dagger). That's it's good part, it's a great survival mode grind. Don't make the misstake to expect more (and i know you will since the games fans tend to blurr out details), you'll only end uo dissapointed if you do.
---
* next, and that one's important: STAY AWAY FROM HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS WHILE YOU'RE LEVELING. If your friend helps you grinding that's fine but if he's not pulling you, tell him to get some distance. The enemy scaling in this game is horrible - It scales according to the player level but doesn't actually bother to scale back when low level players enter until the area resets (from beeing wiped out enough) so when your friend takes a look at your base, chance is that you won't be able to kill anything in the area anymore. The best places for leveling are middle, west and south of the map. You can try entering the mountains middle east for the raider quests (and a free rank of cannibalism &lt;3) but you really shouldn't set a base there.
---
* and, when setting up a base look for a good location with basic necessarities. For caps, settle near traders and events (you need those for blueprints from the traders and fasttraveling), food and water should be accessable too (again, great survival game). Tatos, Corn and mudfruits can be made to glue, you should plant those asap.
---
* if you've been a dagger player like me in prior fallouts: DO NOT. Onehandet swords are viable, unarmed is viable, twohandet is viable. Daggers, they are not, at least not until the endgame where a vampire legendary makes it a great tank weapon but they're not the damage monsters they used to be.
---
Well, that's about it. Other then that, enjoy :)
---
I have an excavator shock, but don't need T60. Anything else willing to trade?
---
I like it! The lighting is great and makes it more creepy
---
I had it sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree. Going forward, though, I'll probably place turrets on buildable objects as you suggest. 
---
Maybe mine just glitched on polymer arms. I did think what you're saying until it didn't work for me. I sure don't want to have to craft heavy to scrap for all the mods instead light. Fingers crossed. 
---
Kinda. The bunker under the Whitesprings is where the US Congress would’ve went. It’s also a real place but was decommissioned in 1992 after the Washington Post told everyone it existed.
---
Very nice!  How did you sink the TV into the desk to make it look like a PC?
---
Usually it's the first hit I can land on an enemy for me. Which is great, considering some of the more dangerous melee enemies (Deathclaws, Hermit Crabs, Fog Crawlers) can stun chain you into a double or maybe even triple hit combo you can't escape from as the stun has you viewbobbing in place. Sometimes that just means death. Ironically those attacks have a massive hitbox that seems to almost never miss even if their visible melee hitbox does.
---
Oh ok. I haven’t really played that much so I’m not to good with my lore there. 
---
to bad, only thing i can think os then is to move that camp a few meters and cross you fingers :/
---
I guess my argument is: how the servers poorly handled "desync" would not have been much of an issue if people were not duping in the first place.
---
How come? I've never used a lighter anyway.  I've always yanked it off.
---
No idea bud Im still sad about it. I did manage a pretty decent solution with as clean of a look as possible if you need one. 
---
How much do you need?   
---
That is the best camp I've ever seen! Great work!!
---
They said that DLC would be free in the future, but we’re yet to see anything.
---
Probably could be the case too. We as players have no real idea how quickly food is meant to spoil. Who knows if any of us are right. It keeps changing.
---
I hate waiting on the protectrons slow asses
---
Prices are higher on PS4. How many stars and if three what’s the third. 
---
Oh. I did it 2 times in 20 min earlier
---
Clear out the glass cave with excavator armor on...easy 50-75 per run.

I used to be a homebody till I made it my life's mission to get every plan available. Now I build homes for other players.

Nope, it's a part of you stash, even if it dosent look like it :)
---
I just got the game and that's exactly what I've been doing! I just have to find more crafting mats to keep going.
---
They Pop
---
I have gotten thrill of the grill to trigger. Wierd thing is that after it did it would pop up every time I server hopped.
---
O.O I hope it doesn't come to that! I'll probably just go through life down a turret. 
---
They would have called it God mode if they wanted you to be invincible to player damage.
---
Pacifist mode does exactly what the word implies: you do not harm other people, not other people do not harm you.
---
I have found if the sloth gets its head or a limb shot off, the body will not be lootable, but the severed limb/head will be. It worked that way for me on 3 different runs last night.
---
Well im "testing" out some new additions i made to my rabbit hole, i just gotta lure em in there to see if works as intended. If it does then it'll be hilarious. 
---
Happens all the time to me. It gets so frustrating 
---
Ive done BOS questline just cause the entire story is pretty boring, might do enclave aswell
---
Nothing comes to mind right now. I scored the t60 mods yesterday evening.  If you're into the whole cosmetic look I also scored the Hunters long coat, but then I paid 750 for that. I know I have a few random mods sitting in my stash, but nothing outstanding stands out.
---
This, you can also just leave right before the Beast fight at the end.
---
Although there is about 10 veins in that room alone.
---
Rekt
---
Lord I hope not. I hated that "feature"
---
Another very comprehensive answer, thank you. 
---
I just got done watching some youtubers doing the parade, and it pretty much confirms what OP said - only masks I saw on those vids were owl, witch, soldier, giant, and toothy.
---
They cannot.  They cannot even interact with it.  Can't even use it as their own.
---
You can only use a Fermenter at your own CAMP.  Not others' CAMPs or Workshops.  They cannot even be built in Workshops.
---
Lol. We know. 
---
You were behaving just as poorly or not more so. I searched the topic because I recently picked up F76 as it’s finally in a playable state and had the same issue. 
---
You could have answered his question but instead to chose to antagonize him and play games, 
---
Once you take something it is yours. Just because a thing is yours doesn’t that another can’t take it from you. You’re making a dumb semantics based argument and you’re not correct. 
---
If you were on Xbox I was gonna invite you to join or merry band of friends. Good luck out there
---
to the left of watoga station , right by the 2 train wagons (100m) there is a fissure, it has 4-5 ores around it, normally the SB dosent stick it's head up there, but if it does, run back to the wagon and let the assulatrons attack it, then it will forget about you , lol
---
Oh, and that train wagon also spawns nice plans :)
---
I was also talking about DLC. There's nothing they can't add that someone won't consider that "it should have been in the original game". The definition of "content that should have been in there from the beginning" is fluid and it expands as the game does.
---
Seems they are only on pc never seen anyone on ps4 have it
---
Eh I'm just gonna keep the door open
---
Just curious, why would people downvote my above post? I'm just providing helpful information (it's true that the door is glitched as of now, go ahead, try it!), so that people don't overpay for something they can easily just go grab themselves. Without hunting down the keys.
---
While I didn’t expect the event to be too difficult, I did expect a bit more of a challenge. While I have no problem with people server hopping to do the event multiple times, I completely agree they shouldn’t be rewarded for contributing absolutely nothing. 
---
Couldn’t sum it up any better if I tried 😂
---
I have only crafted/scrapped Light Combat Arms (left and right) in my pursuit of Combat Armor mods.  Never crafted Heavy or Sturdy at all.  But I still have the full range of mods on Light, Sturdy, and Heavy legendary items when I acquire them and go to modify them with BOS and Deep Pockets.
---
Why not just play a good game?
---
Go to menu &gt; settings &gt; audio and check all of the sound sliders there. There's been a random bug with the game resetting them down to zero (especially chat). 
---
- other than Biv and the parade?
---
No.  PA is is swapped in for nuke zones, SBQ and any events where I'm better off running around safely bashing stuff in the face over sneaking and sniping.
---
So true! For the past month I've been collecting caps just so I can buy the resort furniture plans. At some point I want to build for other players. I have build a few of my friends C.A.M.P's and pretty sure they liked it &gt;_&gt; (at least that's what they've told me LOL) 
---
I didn't post my C.A.M.P pics on my original post, but I did post the pics on one the of comments above. 
---
No problem!
---
A gusher snack is not a balloon either, but they pop, just like a tick, atleast you dont need a nsfw tag for the gusher.
---
I have a screenshot uploaded of the goblin mask that I got from this event. If you don’t believe me keep reading. Anyway, the mask has a dark color scheme and some horns. It’s a nice mask. If you don’t believe me keep reading. It was my first run and I got it so I don’t know why people are saying it’s rare. If you don’t believe me it’s because I don’t have it. I lied to you. How does that make you feel? 
---
bitch.
---
same, many scout trips turned into a "who could kill the most ticks stuck to people" contest

That’s not true. You just won’t get a quest beacon. If you already know where Paladin Taggerdy is you can just get her items to complete the quest. 
---
I play almost exclusively with my 71 year old father who has always been a fallout fan.  We do have several shared friends who we trade with, run missions, etc. and i always feel bad when they give him shit for being slow with the controller or having trouble finding locations or items, etc.  I have infinate patience and will always wait, but i think a lot of these kids have grown up with a controller in hand and playing fast paced fps's.  I dont see a need to rush through FO76 so we always take our time.  
---
Anyway, you're not the only one!  Thanks for sharing, and RESPECT YOUR ELDERS!!!
---
I set voice chat mode to Area and enable push to talk. That should let you hear people using a mic in proximity to yourself, and allows you to not have your mic broadcast constantly. Both settings are under the Audio settings tab, but don’t forget to set a button for Push To Talk under controls. Hope that helps 😁
---
Nope, that's just the table top TV. I believe there's 3 different style TV'S. 
---
This happened to me yesterday I'm L156 and I'm getting 1 hit even though I didn't attack anyone and didn't have a work shop.
---
I did a run with excavator the other night and did not get anything extra from my normal run. I don't think it works on Ultracite.
---
Chances of receiving anything when there are trolls at the event?
---
Psn: Lufimer
---
I know Dennis.  Your user name is correct.
---
You could tell after 3 hours the event went live that something was wrong 
---
Twitter. Yeah.

my Theory is that they are parts of a second batch starting this 23.  
---
its the date when they remove old man summer mask in the atom store and release the moon mask til the end of Fasnatch.  
---
I really like the layout 
---
Same thing here, noticed I usually only get the hard freeze from food if I use a lot of the same food item in a row very quickly though
---
Got drunk woke up w/ someone in my bed 10/10 
---
I think we may find out some more tomorrow in the inside the vault.
---
I think Immortal is right.  Players participating in the events won't hurt each other.
---
Unless the player has a bounty, in which case apparently you can damage them, but they still cannot damage you.  It is an apparent bug a player posted last night/this morning that they noticed when they were doing the Helvetia event.  The bounty overrides that "no damage during events" settings, but only damage against the bountied player.  Meaning the player with a bounty cannot fight back in events.
---
:P! 
---
Exactly this. There is only ONE online Fallout game. And unfortunately it is being mis-managed into the ground. We as players are doing anything we can to try make it work and are getting nothing back. It's not how a good game develops. 
---
Duping never should have been possible in the first place. The earliest, most common forms of duping where literally just exploiting weird game limitations/mechanics. Craft too much of something, the server will kick you off after a few minutes, but you can trade items to someone in that time. After you get kicked off and log back in, for whatever reason anything you traded/dropped reappeared in your inventory.
---
Excuse me, what? There is no third party function here. Players had this figured out within weeks, if not days, of the games launch. Yet it stayed in the game for months, causing huge long term issues to this day. It's as if no one at Bethesda actually plays the game. The issues are extraordinarily glaring if you just play it for a couple hours per day.
---
This is a AAA game developer/publisher. The mistakes made with Fallout 76 are inexcusable. Yet we excuse them because simply, there is no other online Fallout game. 
---
Noop. Experienced the exact same things yesterday.  Camp loads very slowly and game froze while selecting food from pipboy. Had to log off windows user.  
---
You have made 16 of these posts all within one day. Does no one else find that excessive?
---
Damn commenters are toxic here .  Did you receive a ban email on the account ?
---
Why do we have to keep teaching you this lesson old man?
---
no that is incorrect. the masks are dropping. 3 of 5 masks are labeled uncommon and 2 of them are labeled rare. id suggest learning a bit more about how the data works. most of these drop calculations are done on the server side which we dont have access to the data for. its why a lot of them just say 1 or a roll between 0 and 1. to keep the engine using basically the same format they just fill in any number that the client usually wont care about like that
---
Have you really just counted how many times I’ve posted in 1 day?😂 get a life

Ty , just wanted to let this be known 
---
All I’m saying is the slow stream of content they’ve released thus far should’ve been in the game from the get go. With new dlc like content I can’t make that same argument especially if it brings legitimate quest lines and end game bosses. I get your point tho but I’m not trying to make a disingenuous argument about everything needing to be there from the start, just obvious things like survival servers and something to do with unwanted legendaries, legitimate gameplay features not actual dlc. 
---
I don’t wish I had a PS4,but I do wish you were on XBox. I have almost the same playing style.
---
They have had this for quite a few weeks now, but the posts have mainly been on the official forum. 
---
And nobody is noticing this, but the new items are coming out with much more reasonable prices, then the old stuff. Just look at the deathclaw statue price compared to the powerarmor one. Or the price of the new PA skin.
---
And they gave us even more free atoms with update 7 where you just collect caps in different regions. 
---
I really like the new way they are running the atomic shop - It MAKES me want to use money there! I just wish they could sell a lot more stuff there, because at this rate it's easy to save up a lot of atoms by doing the daily and weekly. 
---
Hey thanks for the feedback. You are all correct, it is easy to collect wood. I myself have no problem collecting wood I know where to get it and if I need large amounts I switch my cards around and use the woodchucker perk to get extra. This is why I said even if it only gave us a small amount of wood. I personally am really into camp building, it's one of my favorite aspects added into Fallout 4. I think the woodpile would be great as an aesthetic like I said before, but if it could be added in it would only make sense to add it in as a resource. 
---
Tl;dr: i think it would look cool and want it as an option.
---
It looks the the image linked in the main post. [This one specifically](https://imgur.com/q4RIH8h). It looks exactly like that.

My character, Rhett, was hoping to be admitted to a Vault in his home state of North Carolina, but was admitted to 76 due to his skill in engineering. Being a classic "country-fried genius', Rhett is a weird blend of country boy and talented intellectual. He can pick off a Scorched from long range with his Handmade just as easily as he can rig up a water purification system, fusion reactor, or homemade still. He is proud of the south, and was overjoyed to find a Confederate uniform in the museum near the battlefield cemetery. He wears it sometimes and proudly wields a Gatling gun when he's not using his Handmade Rifle or All Rise (he greatly enjoys the satisfying squish of ~~yankee~~  Scorched skulls when the jet-assisted hammer hits home). He sympathizes  with the old Free States and the Responders. He has a distaste for the Brotherhood and Enclave, but has to admit the Enclave generals uniform looks good on him. He attempted to hack a MODUS terminal, which earned him an electrical shock and a scolding from the AI for attempting to change it. He has attempted to use MODUS to try to see what his beloved Carolinas are like, but the Kovac-Muldoon is not particularly willing (or able, for that matter) to divert attention to anywhere else, and MODUS attempt at contacting the small Enclave outposts further south have proven fruitless. 
---
He is fascinated by Mothman, after accidentally summoning a Wise Mothman, who he referred to as a "friendly little critter", and this fascination was only piqued even more when he discovered the Cult Of The Mothman. He has a set of cultist gear and blades, and he occasionally wears them in the hopes of attracting the 'friendly little critter' again. He regards Scorchbeasts as "big, ugly, annoying critters", and is more than happy to turn his Gatling gun upon them. 
---
This is freaking AWESOME!!!! I've only built homes for my friends. I wouldn't mind building homes for other people.....if I actually talk to other people in game lol! 
---
Here's my current home. 
---
1500-2000 caps imo
---
Lmao exactly. Felt like the bears when they found Goldilocks in their bed..
---
Because they game is a dumpster fire. 
---
It was ps4
---
Pacifist prevents you from accidentally engaging in PvP by hitting other players or their camps. There was a bug where effects like reactive plates or unstable isotope could cause you to trigger PvP, but I think that was fixed eventually.
---
Workshops are the standard method. Even if you're not in the workshop, one player can contest it (and it's bugged so you don't necessarily get a warning) while their teammate kills you anywhere on the map. There's also a trick where you can take a workshop, team up with someone, hand the workshop to them by quitting to menu, and then rejoining to kill them.
---
I received the winter man mask today.
---
you could take a phone screenshot, then use the mobile browser and upload to imgur or another hosting service

....it just occurred to me I did not account for the 25 year thing. Oh well. 
---
I have most of my intelligent Perk cards (15 points) put into the one for reducing wear on power armor, doubled fusion core duration, and one other one for power armor I think.  It's a real tough piece of armor, not sure why people would be having to repair there's regularly.  Maybe it's a POS from the original construction?  Low Int to begin with making it have a real low durability so wears out too fast?
---
Anyway.. so what? I can post as many times as I like. I put posts up every round for people that might not see the previous posts. For the people that don’t scroll back 1 day through there feed. And it works.. the server I’m in is always full. So many people turn up you would believe. 
---
I have no more time for you.
---
Cya
---
Nope. You get your caps from their inventory in order to deter people from finding a friend and claiming their bounties to farm caps from nothing. Though, that means people who want to PvP or greif can start fights with nothing to lose.
---
And both rare and uncommon global values have a value of 1 locally. Which will be changed or ignored depending on the server. But given that we only have 1(as of right now) confirmed case of a mask on that list dropping there is still *something* wrong, I highly doubt the intended drop rate is supposed to be this low.

There is a good game somewhere buried here. But it's mostly that I like the Fallout series and this is the only online one.
---
That said, I gave up playing World of Warcraft to play 76. WoW isn't exactly good either.
---
The best way to stock up on fusion cores is to 1) get fusion generator plans 2) take a power plant workshop 3) build fusion generator and wire it up to fusion core generator.  This produces 7-10 100% charged cores in an hour.
---
I did this twice and my stash is overflowing, since I find quite a few cores just adventuring and usually have 6-7 of them on me at any time.
---
Look how much older that game is. And how poorly it's launch was received. You can't compare the two evenly. Eso has come a long way but it took time. 
---
Fair enough. The game _did_ release in a pretty anaemic state regarding QoL... 
---
Haha logged back in for a quick event and got the Owl Mask immediately. 
---
Could we get one thing that actually works for once 
---
Looks nice and cozy! It's decorated very nicely. What system are you on
---
Never played WoW. MMOs aren't my thing. You should just go back and do a new playthrough of New Vegas.
---
I spent like 2 hours building my camp
---
From my experience, usually both spawn.
---
They all do. The sloth appears at the same time as the wolf/bug swarm.
---
Awesome thank you for the reply, I appreciate it. I will have to check it out when I get a chance.
---
They are obtainable.  You just have to get a 1 on the random role.   That makes it rare.  Is that hard to understand?
---
Ok, well, that frees up room for card swapping.  Just making sure.
---
im on pc but thanks ;)
---
Just get the grounded mutation. Energy weapons still suck, so there is virtually no downside. 
---
Picks or it didn’t happen
---
Quite a bit.  Someone who was above level 100 just gave it to me sometime back. So I've finally leveled up to be able to use it. 
---
Damn...wish I'd known that. Maybe next character. Thanks for the correction!
---
I just have nothing to say 🤷
---
Obviously because it has been around longer for the team to develop it further
---
The blackout is my favorite part of Nukashine.  
---
Updated post.
---
I have had this happen 
---
I don’t really see that as DLC. It’s just more little quests. DLC is probably something like Far Harbor from Fallout 4.
---
I've done the parade oh like 7 times now and I've always seen both. Well, all 3. The megasloth for the advanced players and the wolves and bugs for the low levels. Sometimes that megasloth gets taken down in a couple of shots or from a different direction so maybe he was there and you missed him.
---
Very optimistic but very unlikely. That wojld be asking alot for a company that promised free dlc. I live just outside of richmond va so having va elements would be cool but as its such a big map already and theres already dlc planned for this year. O dont see it any time soon if at all.
---
XBox...?
---
I stopped playing ESO as soon as I found I couldn't loot whatever I wanted.
---
That's not an Elder Scrolls game, it's a glammed up world of warcraft.
---
That id all.
---
You make me wanna find you a witches outfit tonight. I'll be on in about 30min. Gonna find you that witch outfit or die trying lol. 
---
I think his point is no one uses team speak anymore. Discord is generally what everyone uses now
---
You’ll never believe me but I just kept trying and trying to no avail to open the doors with the cards so I server hopped 3 times at the tnt dump site and one time the door was open with the plans still there. That seems to be your best bet. 
---
Thanks 
---
Unfortunately, this ultracite armor is all I have right now.  Life has been happening and really haven't had much game time lately. 
---
There was someone in my event yesterday that had the goblin mask on so it can drop
---
They always do in addition to the sloth
---
Hot bunking (LOL)
---
UK time here so having a break until 10pm then back on...how can I help?
---
The sloths appears under the tree, next to the house opposite to the bonfire. Usually the sloth gets taken out by explosive weapons within seconds, so unless you are waiting for it, you'll never see it.
---
Interest, thanks
---
Because no one needs to hear me breathing or yelling at my kids or my wife pleading with me to stop playing and get help it's really turning into a problem with you goddammit turn off the game and listen to me that's it I'm leaving and taking the kids hmm oh sorry what were you saying something
---
saved your post. thanks for making the effort my dude!
---
I just want the backpack.
---
and as i said check the discord. many people in there already have those masks
---
If I am playing by myself sometimes I have my mic on with music playing in the background.  I am a walking jukebox!!
---
Had the wolves and stingwing with no megasloth once. Can confirm. 
---
O keep my mic on.
---
Thanks! I play on ps4. 
---
They're actually really good exp while low level, especially from 1-10, doing poseidon is a ton of scorched and good scrap in there, plus the rewards. If I were a fresh starting player I'd do it for sure.
---
I always have mine plugged in, just have it muted.most times. I only turn it on if I run across people already using it.
---
1. Adamantium skeleton and strength dont do anything for getting hit with raw damage. 
---
2. I helped test my buddies builds, serendipity is buggy or broken it wont trigger until you are below 30% hp. If you have 31% hp and a guy hits you with 31%+ of your hp in a single shot you are dead, like 90% of the time. It is only good if you are a bloody build or fighting guys what use high rpm guns like you. 
---
3. Only one guy I know is using an explosive weapons because TSE was heavily duped so everyone has fireproof and or dense. 
---
4. If you think you have enough DR to stop yourself from being 1 or 2 tapped you are silly.
---
5. If they dont remove vats friendly targeting from the game then a game mode with no pvp restrictions means my teammates can use efficient low level weapons to build vats crit bars off each other while you are trying to figure out where to respawn. 
---
6. If you are in PA you stomp like a monster truck and we will hear you a mile away. If you try to sneak in PA we will see your hulking fat ass. The only thing PA is good for is using as an impromptu wall unless they patched it out and make bullets pass though it if you are not in it. 
---
7. Dude I dont like to argue on the internet, you obviously did research on how to make yourself stronger, but I think you overlooked a few things. So tell me what is the max damage potential of a bloody gauss with full rifleman or bloody pipe bolt using rifleman and gunslinger perks. What about if they vats crit you and have basic psycho and or the super cheap to make ballistic beer? Do you honestly think you can consistently win when the enemy is invisible, kills in one or two shots, and is out of radar range? Also no slap damage means mines will probably work, so are you going to advance on a fortified sniper position? 
---
8. None of this matters because it will probably be a new game mode where everyone starts at level 1 with complete separation between the two worlds so best of luck to you if that happens but if it does not be prepared for crazy gank fests.   
---
Okey this escalated quickly :D
---
Probably should have mentioned I am on PC and here we got. Our selfs good ol' push to Talk
---
To be honest. The megasloth is easier than the hordes of wolves.
---
To me ESO is just another MMO with not so great mechanics, Fo76 is closer to the franchise and what bethesda has been delivering for a few years now.  
---
(Not a bad game, just not so special).
---
Just recently moved my house again and was pretty proud of my build. Then I see this...
---
While true, this is honestly the worst recipe in the game. Far too costly for how easily they are otherwise obtained.
---
If you have the perks maxed out for power patcher it lowers it quite a bit. I can't remember how much, but 3 or less per piece of armor.  If you're on, I can fix it for you. 
---

Hey if you need some.purified water and stimpacks to get you started I'll be off work and online in about 3 hours from now.  I'll hook you up no charge.  I have like 8 water purifiers at my camp that produce 5 each every hour. So I dont need that much lol.   And I have some stimpacks you can have

Hey, sorry for the absence! I  tried

\[TerrainManager\]  
---
fBlockMaximumDistance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel2Distance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel1Distance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel0Distance=0.0000  
---
fTreeLoadDistance=0.0000  
---
fSplitDistanceMult=0.7500 
---
as suggested by PatrickJr and that made quite a difference. Still a lot of stutters and hiccups but much more playable.
---
Then I thought I would fuck with the shadows and did this; 
---
fShadowDistance=3000.0000
---
fDirShadowDistance=3000.0000
---
iShadowMapResolution=512
---
and tbh I didn't notice a difference in shadow difference but quality defo dropped. Some reason the game ran even worse after this? Maybe just a bad server, I'd need to try again but odd nonetheless.  
---
this is the only post of value, ty
---
Mostly cause it gets taken down in seconds than killing the individual wolves.
---
Or in modern parlance, "Outstanding move".
---
Also check that your chat isn't randomly set to zero. The game has been doing that lately. 
---
So that's where my ex and kids moved to.
---
Banned accounts that seemed to receive a ahort reprieve last week have been un-unbanned.
---
LOL! Yuuuuup sounds about right. I always tweak things or make sure everything is lined up right before I can be done. 
---
It’s odd that everyone is silent, and makes the world feel weird—not in a good way. 
---
I assume it’s because most players spend a lot of time solo or they’re in a console or 3rd party chat with their team. It could just be that a lot of Fallout fans just aren’t used to it so it’s uncomfortable.
---
I’d like to see Bethesda roll out some events that require real time communication. Something like the new Fasnacht event that draws everybody in, but with some sort of code cracking or puzzle solving where it’s impossible to do it without other people. 
---
1 star bloodied sniper weapon will work just fine, assuming you run a proper bloodied build with the right mutations.
---
Yeah, fuck me, it took 30 seconds to do. No life. Will I be cool like you if I make a post on Reddit every time I scratch my balls?
---
You can't PvP inside an event.
---
Maybe Im missing something but I have always had to mash the button about ten thousand times while in vats just to get one swing out of my GrogAxe
---
THis. If you can't afford 1-2K for a good 1 star bloodied or instigating... IDK man. That isn't that much. you get that while leveling and doing quests for a few hours easily.
---
100%?  Because the entire fucking town is under a forced pacifist mode while the event is up and you can't kill anyone else or the robots?  Literally the only way to "troll" this event is to drop a nuke on it.
---
He can't take any of your junk, he can take your crops and water if unlocked.  I leave everything unlocked so people can help themselves, I rather help other wastelands than worry about if they stealing my stuff, it regenerates so there is absolutely no reason to lock anything ...
---
I wish there was a dude like you on PS4 :(
---
I've had this exact issue from the beginning too.
---
I've noticed in vats I have to wait till my swing animation resets before it'll let me hit again.
---
Problem is there no video or photographic evidence of these masks just people saying they have seen them.  I am going to run the event a bunch will screen capture if I run into one.
---
You can also purchase them from some vendors, definitely the Whitesprings bunker production vendor.
---
That would be great and you've got a good point there it feels kinda odd to talk to other humans while playing fallout but silence isn't better 
---
I read your comment and understood it, but it's also a little ambiguous because of the post it's attached to. It could *almost* be seen as you defending this other guy to someone not paying attention to context, especially to the people whose comment is BAN THAT GUY!!11!!
---
Don't worry, people. The people that deserve to be banned will eventually get banned, because they're always pushing the limits and trying to find new ways to cheat. It's pretty inevitable. 
---
Another way to farm steel is to pass through the Big Bend tunnel farming the scorched, almost all of which will drop something that scraps to steel. Go from one end to the other, server hop, and return.
---
Know what else is really stupid? People who think that this argument justifies them being an asshat.
---
You can make a battle that's nowhere near as hard as the SBQ and still takes more than one shot to complete. 
---
Suggesting there's nowhere to go between these two extremes is a silly argument.
---
I play with mine on, but I'm rarely the one to initiate a conversation.
---
? Gauss is 100% ballistic, Plasma weapons are half and half.
---
Do you enjoy being filled with sausage?
---
The legendaries are not the point. 
---
The fact that half the time that event completes with 5-10 people throwing a thumbs-down or angry-face, read: the way it ended, at the end of the day, made them unhappy, is. 
---
Okay, this is epic
---
There’s two endings, wolves and stung wings or the mega sloth 
---
Same here, LVL 211 and have no hope against them... So I don't fight back but it sucks because they should be taught a lesson lol!
---
You need to do a sneak critical. I did it and it completed.
---
Poorly implemented checkpoints, basically. Or should I say, not enough of them.  Basically if you are doing a mission and you don't see any checkpoints, but you get booted from the server, you are starting over from the beginning, sadly.
---
If youve been banned in the past, its another ban
---
Oh my tender feelings. I’m absolutely slain right now. 
---
My 1st parade the sloth didnt spawn. But has every time since. 
---
Your dignity.
---
Not much since most everyone will have it by the time the event ends, I got three back to back in 3 different runs yesterday.
---
If people keep playing they can get everything.
---
Just got two more food recipes as well. It’s not difficult to get the effigy if you do continuous runs.
---
There is no backpacks dropping
---
[buddy...](https://imgur.com/a/2SbEksF)
---
I also updated my main post pointing out your information.
---
its true that place is like amaze the first time you get there
---
I saw all the wolves and stingwings spawn, but never saw the sloth.
---
It wasn't that he didnt spawn, it was he died SUPER fast. In the opposite direction of the crowd.
---
Have you tried just taking a technical data to the stash at Camp Venture. I don't even look for it to pop if I have one. 
---
I like that theory
---
Goblin is witch
---
I was hit in January with the “perma ban unless you appeal” and I recently got an email back after 2 months saying my account was just “suspended for having over 100k rare items” so this error is because I am still suspended? Thanks for your info dude much appreciate it
---
A lot of words were said so statistically some of them should be good but they weren't. 
---
Yeah lol there is. It's called the pioneer backpack. Drops in May or something. 
---
Well if it sounded like I did, Im sorry, I wasn't meaning to suggest that.
---
I have been screwed over by people killing the sloth too fast too and I can see why others would be annoyed by it.
---
It mostly doesn't effect me because I'm not super pressed on killing stuff and looting things. I'm in it for the hats :/
---
Yea its still the suspension one, a bunch of others said the same on here
---
Has anyone ran the event while the area is in a nuke zone? Just wanted to throw ideas out there 
---
just server hop a known PA location until you have a full set, shouldn't take that long
---
real life calling! 
---
Does anyone know why I haven’t been able to collect from the mega sloth? I’ve played the event four different times and it happened each time. I don’t think I was the only one either.
---
Ah okay. Thanks man
---
Follow the signs on the walls. If there's no sign for a bit and you have to decide which way to go, keep going in the same direction.
---
It helps to realize that the bunker is sort of linear; the path doesn't branch. It goes: service exit, production, medicine, science, military, resort exit.
---
Thank god for this post, I thought my skills had degraded 99% for not playing for week.
---
I finally found the terminal though
---
I had this issue. Had to give mine to a friend and have him trade them back to me 1 at a time. 
---
It's also worth mentioning that it could have been acquired illegitimately. There was a post earlier floating around of someone that has a backpack already, even though it has not been released
---
I have found that and it was my first full suit of pw without missing pieces!
---
Not my work but extremely helpful

---
I got rid of marathoner... good perk but I put in thru hiker.  One of my must haves for weight.  
---
I took out white knight and the agility for it and put it in INT and put in power patcher.  My reasoning is that while stealthed you'll sneak kill.  no real combat.  In PA you'll be getting hit a lot more.
---
I added 3 points to endurance because I love lead belly.  Radiation is the silent killer.  This opens up to a lot of food choices combined with thru hiker.
---
I took away green thumb because I figured you could swap to it when harvesting.
---
I added 2 point to charisma and tacked on suppressor.  This also brings you cha up to 6 which means if you do group you can share a rank 2 card.
---
Just my thoughts.
---
I firmly believe they have reduced the drop rates all round. I'm fortunate enough at the moment to be able to play for quite a bit each day and I'm noticing new things all the time at the moment. There was some sort of global rad storm today that I'd not seen before and rads seem to have a lot more of an effect on you now. There are various other changes that they have not released notes about probably because a lot of them we wouldn't like and also hopefully for the surprise factor. 
---
The drop rates have been low for a few patches now but recently they have also started messing with plans. Again I'm convinced that this has happened over the last few days as the locations I have used have had less and less and are responding weirdly or not as often. There is a shielded under armour that spawns every time in one location now for example. 
---
I like the surprise factor and the fact that they are making the game a bit more challenging as long as they don't go too far... currently they need to either increase the amount of 3* enemies or 're evalutate the drop rates on all items. 
---
what does the moon mask look like do you know? 
---
Belching Betty would have a better ambiance for that look.
---
I’ve heard that nuking the area prevents the event from starting. Haven’t confirmed it yet. 
---
Pretty sure everything is powered by fusion cores to begin with... not that obvious here but vehicles in fo4 actually radiated quite a bit on destruction. Means they only need a makeover and a fresh fusion core to operate..
---
It's not actually I would have felt sooo dumb if that happened xD 
---
&gt;That’s the way the DMV works IRL, 
---
Nonsense.  What the OP is talking about is nothing close to real life. 
---
 You don't take a number at the DMV, and then suddenly your number vanishes    and you are back at your house, having to drive all the way back. 
---
Ah that makes sense, again I leave mine unlocked, junk respawns .. you can lock it, but I rather let people help themselves.
---
I'm thinking you could put arms from a T-60 on the excavator and get the perk from mods installed on them while  still keeping the100 extra carry weight. Guessing if you don't use excavator legs you lose the extra carrying weight perk. So if you don't mind mixing your armor peices you can still have armor mods you currently have from other PA sets and don't have to find excavator mods. Will have to try this tonight to see what does what.
---
they said the game was going to be supported with free content updates, no one said anything about free DLC, Biv and the parade start the first season of content, to be dripfed over the coming weeks, soon we are getting a survival mode, legendary vendor, and a questline and backpack...  then we get the summer update called Nuclear Winter, and a fall update called Wastelanders, it's all layed out in their [roadmap](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx1MPS0ZHhAhWFnOAKHezlDosQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffallout.bethesda.net%2Fen%2Farticle%2F7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn%2Ffallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bOcUCqo_ZR2NJLia-v9QC)
---
Headphones were a quick lesson in "no, I don't want to hear your crap, you wanker." And there were enough trade horror stories that I'll just avoid that altogether as well.
---
Same brah
---
Nah had a few of people with tse weapons instakill the legendary sloth at the end so nobody else fot to tag it.
---
you could do it, ive been gathering three star shitters from watoga ever since i heard we could trade em.
---
Statistically there is still one other variable, while playing last night we kept all 5 robots alive and I did not receive any mask on 1 out of the five runs. During those 5 runs no robots died at all.
---
The market would actually be deflated in that instance.
---
The value of Materials affects the value of the cap, and in turn, everything else. When supply is greater than demand, people stop buying when they have enough, leasing to an economic crash. Exact premise of the Great Depression.
---
The way to stop that is to make more people participate in resource sinks like workshops, and nerf things.
---
We know how nerfing things goes, so the last route is participation.
---
Systems that require participation inevitably fail, and exploits are part of the system itself, so you’ll have an influx of system exploiters who just don’t fight people, and value goes down further.
---
Yea the idea sounds cool, but the workshop system right now works, and isn’t tied into the economy of the game, and that’s how it should stay, and without a tie into the economy of the game, the system you have proposed is inefficient and nobody would participate in it. 
---
Up voted because true. Lots of future potential. 
---
No got really frustrated after swinging like 20 times at a 63 level scorched that was normally a one hit.
---
I did it last night completed fine, Sometimes the server is bugged, so if you sneaking and kill them in 1 kill, hop servers. I use a sniper rifle and crouch and shoot and no problem.
---
And here you're right. But have in mind that bethest changed few times lore of the game and it depends from them what those things will run on. Yet it's still wonderfull how person that can craft and modify complicated and difficult to mantain things can't reperair some old car. In f4 you even reperaired submarine.

---
Lol it hasn't been working. Still getting legendaries not dropping legendary items. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Yes, Alexkgb ran it nuked. He has a video. But basically the nuke zone I think went away when the parade started and then all the enemies was nuked enemies. After the event it went back to a nuke zone. 
---
I’m trying to deck out a nice radium rifle I got my hands on. Problem is mods. Takes 5-10 scraps to learn each one, and takes 15 screws to craft one. 
---
Every assured-screw-drop (wendigo or sloth) I miss just makes me make a face. And what I’ve noticed is I’m not the only one. 
---
This is three point of this post - just because you’re in it just for the hats, doesn’t mean everyone else is too. 
---
And did the event fail?  No, because that isn't trolling the event.
---
All I have received is the Beret and x3 witch masks haha. Also got the odd plan/recipe too
---
At the abandoned bog town, there is a building just west of the workshop station, the bottom 2 floors are easily accessible. If you go to the south east corner of the 2nd floor and look up, there is a hole in the ceiling, use marsupial or a jetpack to jump up there and you should find 10 ish typewriters, it doesnt get looted that much as most people miss the entrance or dont have the ability to jump up there.
---
I saw something about it after a month or two after release. I could be wrong then. But how’s this backpack going to work? Is it cosmetic or more carry weight?
---
did it last night with a VATS critical 
---
I don’t know how to fix that specific problem but you should report that to Bethesda Support 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/
---
if it wasnt you then i apologize. another example of causation vs correlation.
---
Great info! I did one last night ( it was kinda weird in that one guy was being an ass and trying to start a PVP fight) but all the robots survived and I got a soldiers mask. 
---
I actually start talking the moment I see someone always starting with
---
"hello fellow survivor" :D
---
True but my friends are not very trustworthy and frequently stop by my camp to take something.
---
You can get the backpack skin. Just not functioning. So maybe that's what they seen
---
I’ve only made 2 camps so far! I kinda got attached to my second one but now I really want to move. I might move nearer to white springs. I want somewhere scenic with water nearby!
---
Most scrap materials can't be sold to vendors, because the sale price would be less than 1 cap per piece. In order to sell it you use a tinker workbench and plastic to pack it into bulk units, which might be 10 or 15 or even 30 pieces of scrap per unit, depending on the material.
---
Since you can only store 800 pounds in your stash, it is a good habit to bulk and sell off excess scrap from time to time.
---
I mean that's a legit reason for being quiet :D
---
IIRC reddit won't send a ping to usernames if you include more than 3.
---
did you click the link?  all the info is there, maybe just follow their social media to know when the content comes and what it's about
---
Well your information is incorrect to some capacity and you barge in by calling out someone how has a lot more work in to their point. Also those loads of picture are seeming  missing. I’ve scoured the discord and haven’t found much in any of the channels. Please point to one and tell how far in it is. Besides, how “rare” those masks are I have it to see some try to sell them for a pretty penny. 
---
Been getting the same problems on ps4.
---
It kinda breaks the event apparently. Final_Render on YouTube has done a video basically saying don't try it! The squirrels etc don't spawn in for ingredients.
---
Yes I'm on Xbox what's your offer gamertag is ApologiseMeow 
---
You can only sell certain junk after it has bulked at a Tinker's Workbench.  The Tinker's Workbench is also where you make ammo.  Bulk is the option right below Ammo.  Aluminum and Lead will save weight in your stash after it has been bluked.  DO NOT SCRAP THE BULKED MATERIAL.  You will just waste your plastic.
---
It works! And im out, gotta go make money IRL. I wonder how many time's you get reported before actions are taken against you though, these people get salty quick and spam on that report button. Raider traders are part of the game too so w/e.
---
You need better friends, I am actually talking about randoms coming to my camp, rather they take what they want and not destroy my camp. I don't spend a lot of time at my camp.
---
I hear you, I had this team mate once that kept on taking the water and then telling he was .. you do get leachy people sometimes.
---
Your sloth probably got killed without you seeing it.
---
Most people don't speak unless spoken to. I just keep my head down and focus on whatever 'work' I'm doing at the moment.
---
I just did the event it's now lvl 50 wolves
---
There was technically not much reason to given that you could summon helicopters (the fast travel of the survival mode if you haven't sidet with the institute) but hey, in here it would make quite a bit of sense.
---
Me, i'd sure af try to get a car running when the only other options i have are running or a costy teleporter.
---
Right! I just threw down a witch mask for someone to take. I'm getting the same things over and over. Guess I should consider myself lucky that I got the beret.
---
Thanks for your responses. I got all the leather mods by scrapping what I picked up because studded and deep pocketed popped so early for me, and that's what I wanted. I know they worked across armor weights. Just those combat arms are flumoxing me, but I will definitely stick to crafting light arms thanks to you. 
---
I'm on PS4, but nearly always have my mic on. Even if I'm not playing on a team, just in case I run across other players who might want to say hi and chat.
---
Well did you prepare for the death tower?
---
The thing I hate most about daily quests is when your half way done with one.  But the progress doesn't save when your server drops out and you have to start over. Every gamers nightmare is starting something over...
---
I always greet other players with a "hello fellow survivor" 
---
Wow, now that was worth of AFK. I mean, at least something interesting happend.
---
It's an hour reset from when the event begins, so usually 20-30 mins after it ends.
---
I agree with this wholeheartedly, I made my account and some dumb name to go with it since I figured I’d be able to make one separately when starting the game. Now I’m stuck with donglord**
---
I wonder that as well, how many times are people going to report you for cheating/exploiting when you clearly aren't.
---
My guy, I get that, I'm not saying everyone else is. Why so antagonistic? I know I'm an odd duck out and I know the struggle for screws
---
 Just because I'm not actively shooting and looting doesn't mean I don't have to farm screws. My equips n guns need repair just like everyone else.
---
I'm not discounting the people hunting like crazy for screws.
---
Also, just because you’re in it just for the screws, doesn’t mean everyone else is too. 
---
I always wait for everyone to tag the enemy before bashing it, it's just common courtesy, I have seen others wait as well, not sure why a lot don't...
---
I read the title of this post and I was really hoping for a story of a high level players briefing newbies about the game mechanics and farm spots, and I am kinda bummed its not such a story.
---
Hopefully - send me a friend request now, and if that day ever comes I will hit you up.   I am Woodchuck on PSN.    Guess I will stick with Division 2 and Far Cry New Dawn...
---
I"m only talking about your STR tree choices for slugger here. Remove the single 3 star slugger card, go with three 1 star cards, you gain 10% damage

Hey man, you are more than free to be you. Just don't get butthurt when I call you out on it. Trolls have never intimidated me, and I call 'em like I see 'em. 
---
What do they do...
---
Did you do a VATS crit or sneak crit? Try both
---
Mining suit is 800
---
Can buy the mask for 500, or get it in game(?)
---
&gt; Seems it's not only an italian problem but most of non english version
---
That's why we have hundreds of posts about this on this reddit, right? Or do we? Can you back up that claim with anything? I'm playing the German edition (in English, of course, so I wouldn't experience that bug if it were real), and I've seen other players' names that were clearly Italian, Russian, German, Polish, French, and so on, all day long.
---
Are you SURE it is not just you?
---
This happened to me too. I could only deploy one set of power armor, when I tried to deploy a second one it was stored in my stash and became a duplicate of the t51 (with paint from the atom store) I was wearing. 
---
I ended up just dropping the duped frame to destroy it. Now I don’t dare to deploy any of my power armor, fearing they will be copied over as well. 
---
Yeah, there is literally no point to participant. Rewards sucks and event is boring. Yes, first time it was interesting, but after that it becomes boring. I literally leave my character there top of the house and alt+tab out of the game and go writing few lines of code. 
---
I go in with plain hazmat suit and unarmed weapon and maybe die once
---
Ah True.
---
Good thing I have 20 unused points right now. Thanks for the insight!
---
The sloth gets killed (and glitches out) in less than 3 seconds, so people (read low levels) shoot the wolves and bug instead.
---
Party
---
Because the sausage requires intestines, are we going to see intestines in the future after the event expires? Or is it tied to the event only? Would that mean, the sausage could only be produced during the event?
---
Twin Lakes by Huntersville is a nice location, has water and is close to White Springs. I have build a C.A.M.P there before and loved it. 
---
Hopefully people will realize that the sloth only gives low level stuff and they'll stop focusing on it so hard...
---
Fiesta 
---
This legit sounds like a shitty copypasta
---
Unarmed, one handed melee, two games melee, pistols, auto pistols, rifles, auto rifles, shotguns, explosives, and (non-explosive) heavy guns are all separate weapon classes with their own perks.

It’s the 2nd picture in this tweet by Bethesda uk:

---
It looks very cool, I feel a purchase coming on lol
---
Well. Now i can play without Internet off
---
I have no idea
---
I agree 100%. They compromise everything for casual players and the game suffers for it.
---
i just have a flamingo garden and a table tower taking up most of my space.
---
Agreed! If the robots die and it fails, nobody gets a Mask, and it's kind of a disappointing moment for the whole crowd.
---
Once an hour, I'm told.

I think it's so cool how I've encountered every person from every age spectrum playing this. 
---
You get it completing the quest. It tells you if you lose it you can buy another in the bunker. 
---
Danké 
---
the holotape checks the status of nuke silos, to see if any are ready for launch. IMO a waste of caps unless you have nothing else to buy
---
Could the proof be a photoshop of the summer mask available on the atom shop? With modified eyes? Not saying it is... 
---
Festivität
---
It’s on now
---
Well they aren't wrong. It's a pretty boring and under rewarded. It is more entertaining to sit on top of the house and watch what scrubs do. I always smirk when everyone is walking in front of the parade and then suiciders are just "ala akhbar" parade from behind. Luckily for scrubs difficulty is on so low, that they can get away with it.
---
They must be right then though I can't think of any good reason to have an item with multiple names. That's the Second Man for me.
---
It will trigger again if you find one out in the world. Maybe put one in a container (not at c.a.m.p.) and pick it up?
---
Doesn’t look like a heart rate monitor to me!
---
Event 
---
This is false, I was being killed last night during the event by 3 different players that just took turns killing me.
---
I just saw a post on this suggesting that if you can place it in one of the file cabinets or container in the bunker then pick it back up it may trigger it.   
---
I can't verify since I dumped them. 
---
How about first give us actual endgame, so that there was means to gather like minded people around you.
---
Lasts a week. Should run until next Tuesday 
---
Hey I’m sorry but I can’t do the trade tonight. I can do the trade on Friday at 8, but from now till then I have things going on. That ok with you?
---
HAHAHA lol, I would legit love to see people dropping turret towers now that everyone can build and have 10 turrets, but the detection range on turrets was not good last I checked. It was a while back and I didnt check searchlights because in the old system it would have been stupid to sacrifice dps for a light, but with the new system a death tower might work if searchlights have range and can detect people in stealth. Well I will test that or are you talking about something else? I am not on reddit as much as most these days and when I am it is on the trade forum. 
---
That information isn't true.  Had someone with a 5c bounty I was able to kill this afternoon during the event.  
---
When you complete quest that unlocks access to silos, one is given for free as a reward. Dont know if it is possible to get this holotape other ways.
---
Are you on Pc? My antivirus was causing my issue. I play with it off and my pics show up.
---
What platform? If PC, did you customize your install at all (in terms of save directories, that sort of thing)?
---
That’s literally impossible
---
Atoms come free with playing the game...no need to spend money just play the game and the atoms roll in.
---
Any idea which one/zone?
---
Didn't they few patches ago change it so that when you have pacifist on, reflective plates and such things don't get triggered by player
---
If the event is boring and the rewards suck, than maybe just don't do it. But by don't do it, I don't mean go to the event and afk, I mean go do something else instead.
---
A queen bee one? Not sure which 
---
Ahhh thank you! I will definitely check that area out!
---
tbh I don't even notice a difference using that perk with any heavy weapon.   AGLs are hopelessly inaccurate and combined with their ammo weight and r.o.f, they are a pointless weapon.  Kind of fun to use but not worth the stash space imho.
---
Cool thanks man
---
The building is one of the best parts of the game. Sucks I have to go out and get materials for it tho 
---
Have you actually played the game for more than a few hours? Atoms really only come in the early hours, later on the influx of Atoms dries up nearly entirely, unless you wanna spend all day every day doing the boring challenges.  
---
No need to bullshit me.
---
You could think that but I addressed his post in the order he listed things all while making lunch for an unruly 4 year old. I know, you don't have to say it, super dad. 
---
If you’re on XBOX, I’ll come destroy his ass.
---
If I fail, I’ll pay you back +1000 caps.
---
And I’ll keep it anonymous.
---
Yeah, in my stashbox.  PS4?  I found it in a bag at the top of the church belltower in Helvetia but that means nothing, plan spawns like that are an RNG thing.
---
i got two..but im ps4..one for both my characters..off the subs
---
What do you lose with it me being in there and AFK? If I am already sitting in base doing nothing, then as good as I can just jump on that event and sit there. 
---

Is this like the new trust fall thing? ;) Love the gold/black X-01 paint. Hope that comes back...

I have collected 38 thus far attempting this. I deposited all of them and pick them up at white springs at it doesnt trigger. I've also tried it while holding all my files and picking a new one up. No luck unfortunately 
---

Yea thats cool dont worry the ammo has ur name on it.
---
thats cool..after we finished the event yesterday Helvetia turned into PVP CITY

Light leather is a different armor type than sturdy or heavy. Pain, I know - if I have some dropped legendary that I want to improve but it’s the heavy version, I’m SOL until I find a source of that  piece and scrap it.

Given that datamining is a violation of the games ToS, I'm not so sure that was a great idea.

I get plenty of intestines killing beavers near watoga. I was able to get the job done during a nuke with stuff I already had
---
I’ll pay for it I’m on now 
---
The word *fusion* means "a merging of separate elements into a unified whole". *Nuclear fusion*  refers to the "union of atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei resulting  in the release of enormous amounts of energy" (Merriam-Webster Online,  www.m-w.com). Fusion takes place when two low-mass isotopes, typically  isotopes of hydrogen, unite under conditions of extreme pressure and  temperature.
---
Fusion is what powers the sun. Atoms of Tritium and Deuterium (isotopes  of hydrogen, Hydrogen-3 and Hydrogen-2, respectively) unite under  extreme pressure and temperature to produce a neutron and a helium  isotope. Along with this, an *enormous* amount of energy is released, which is several times the amount produced from fission.
---
So technically Fusion Cores should last for a *very long time.*
---
No small animals in the nuke zone,  cant find intestines. 
---
Good bit
---
Here I’ll send a pic in a second 
---
Yep PC. I always forget to specify in my post.
---
PC. Im gonna check if my photos are saved in the right place.
---
If it roles a number between 0 and 1 that doesn't seem to make it impossible.  It depends on how many decimal places the number uses. 1 Decimal = 10%, 2 Decimals = 1%, 3 Decimals =.1%, etc.
---
Awe thank you  ! Too bad we arent on the same platform.  
---
Agreed. But people are assholes. 
---
I’m talking about the new PvP survival mode
---
I saw a Jester mask last night while server hoping. Sorry to say I didnt get a capture because I didnt know it was rare.
---
I saw someone yesterday with sun mask, pretty soon after the event went live as well. I dont have picks though. 
---
Yes! So cool, but so terrifying. Kind of a test of bravery.
---
Imagine coming straight outta the vault and seeing that duo walk past you at the Overseer’s Camp!!
---
My sound sliders are still we're the shuld be I tried taking them down to zero the bring them back up but still nothing. I then changed the voice chat mode and it came back but as soon as I leave the menu I goes out again. 
---
If you can’t login to bethesda its a perma ban and not a suspension 
---
I don’t feel like screenshotting then downloading it off the app but here it is [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/suYYtb6)

Oh and I have all rifleman perks maxed out too.

There is a trading market. r/market76

You felt bad but stole his stuff anyway?

I’ll sell everything I don’t need. Legendaries, ammo, chems, junk, plans, recepies..

You aren't supposed to talk about Fight Club...
---
It didn't feel as bad while doing it but it hit me sometime after.
---
LMFAO!!! This is great!!!
---
I will after I'm done laughing.
---
Yeah, I was perma banned at first. But then I got the email saying my account was “suspended for 100k rare items” so how can I be perma banned then suspended? confused at this!
---
Well, using the vertibirds had other uses than just survival. Fast traveling skips forward in time to how long it would take the SS to get there in foot. If your settlement was under attack and you were far away, fast traveling could sometimes mean that you’ve already lost when you load in. But if you used a vertibird, you’d still get there in real-time. 
---
the parade ends in a week dipshit
---
Oh also one thing I didn't bring up but it is your favor. All autostim in the game from armor or perk cards has a cooldown but the medic pump chest on some powerarmor, I have not tested them all, has no cooldown. 
---
Medic Pump uses the lowest value stim you have so you will need to carry only super stim packs but if you are fighting a guy like me that uses vats but does not focus on crits instead being a pure damage + concentrated fire then my entire vats bar will probably be used getting your armor to pump you full of enough heal over time to make you invincible to anyone that can't 1 tap you. 
---
Lol I'm a dipshit for stating I'm just ready for the backpack update? Jesus you kids are toxic. 
---
I NEED that sun mask, I've played the event too much today, all I can hear is that tooting music
---
Lololol
---
Or more precisely, the chance of the mask loot table even being looked at, since it's a nested loot table and the outer table has different chances to open that table.
---
yup ganna buy that one, i was debating between the summer one and whatever the moon one looked like. i am decided now
---
Aren’t raiders psychopaths most of the time?
---
Not a single one of my photos was stored in the designated folder, i hope i didnt lose all of them. I had some good times with photomode.
---
Regardless of whether or not the numbers are working as intended,
---
**1 player out of** ***THOUSANDS*** getting a specific mask is kind of ***INSANE*** for an event that's a week long.

Fuck half the player base? In a game that launched poorly? Bold words.

Ive seen screenshots on here of someone with the Winter Man Mask, might have started dropping, but can't say for certain 
---
Why not both

&gt; If anyone has any sensible, silly, or down right preposterous ideas for a name of the Hospital I don't mind changing the sign :).

Well, now i already can play normal. Thx
---
Awe thank you gor the offer but unfortunately im on PC
---
Did you click on build or modify/repair?
---
You need to go through modify/repair to attach mods.
---
Also we may have the scrap mods bug again.
---
Legendaries, always. But bring some mollies for the trash mobs. PA with Tesla coil does nicely too.
---
Or it's one of those people who had those masks from the dev room.
---
Sounds like you need to submit a ticket to Bethesda. I'm sorry you're having such a rough return. 
---
I like this idea, except for the using up your resources again part.
---
I have balloon plans. For a small fee.
---
If your on ps4 or Xbox any time you do to play you could appear offline?
---
It won't stop asshat behavior but, it'll hopefully stop putting you into a position that makes you unhappy.
---
Damn. That sucks. I will say that I’m looking for assassin work ever since that subreddit died.
---
That’s facts too!  Here’s to hoping tho 
---
Yeah I looked everywhere, even in my junk pile,and I looked in craft and modify/ repair
---
That's right. No Fallout fan asked for PvP. We wanted co-op. Traditional Fallout fans are predominantly rpg players. We played games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls, not Fortnite and Overwatch. Every game doesn't have to cater to those players. My son plays Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, Plants vs Zombies, Destiny, Titanfall, Battlefield, and COD - just to name a few. The MOBA players have no shortage of PvP fps battle arenas games. They can sit this one out or just play it as a non PvP rpg like we want it. 
---
Then on top of all that, the horrible legendary weapons like TSE - those should be deleted from the game TODAY.  Where is the sport in jumping around a map like coked up kangaroos killing each other in single shots? 
---
Not really. Assassins sentinel with serendipity and some other perks makes bloodied useless against me. It's just annoying having kids run around bragging that they have an extremely common item that requires no skill to use. I have the same stuff but rarely use it because it's boring. 
---
There were a lot of fast travel disconnects and lag outs when I did it, think I had to try it 6ish times...
---
Deal what’s psn?
---
Alright thanks for the help 
---
I'm the toonie
---
It is challenging in a way. You have to protect some weak robots from several suicide mutants and other things and that part isn't super easy because the robots think they can fight. 
---
The original C.A.M.P. had a peaked roof but decided after checking the architecture of a local hospital changed the design to a flat central piece. The only issue is that the flat piece doesn't an visible overhang.  
---
I'm the toonie. Lol.
---
People dont put time in for the full set... they buy duped ones.
---
Thank you so much for the offer its very kind of you to help me out. 
---
58 here and haven lots of fun with the kids. Mic on and ready to go. Here I come to save the dayyyy.
---
It is mildly infuriating that I can click on an item in the list, and when moving my mouse across the row, if I even just touch another row the item I chose changes. What in the actual fuck?
---
Bethesda, if I click on an item, that is the fucking item I'm choosing. Not the one beneath it, not the one above it, that item.
---
Thats really well done!! Nice work
---
Add me :Ultimatesaucegod
---
No problem.  You can add me whenever. I'll be on in a couple hours.  My name is the Same as here.  Just let me know your in game name so I know it's not a random person 
---
Yes they do man. More people than not have them in my experience. Also you really helped your arguement with the childish personal insults. That definitely isn't a tactic for people with nothing of value to add to a conversation or anything....
---
Ha, I play (xbone) with several kids 16-21 that are not as old as my son. I use a mic, help the newbies and enjoy murdering mole miners and scorch beasts. I can play FPS but much prefer RPG
---
Psn is Trickay1stave

Sounds like you bought the plans, not the mods specifically. You need to read the plans to learn then, them mod your armor in the modify menu at a PA station with your PA out

this works for me I have most an album of the gigs I played across the wasteland

The outfits are to add to the overall troll factor. +3 troll appearance.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3bw4b/fasnacht_event_rewards/eizgrox/
---
&gt; Hey there! We had a stream today where we talked to Dev's who worked on this event and one things they mentioned that you may be interested in, is that different masks drop depending on how many robots survive (or don't survive) 
---
It's probably for the arm not the leg. The light vs heavy does not matter, but scrapping arms and legs just unlocks random LIMB mods, could be either. 
---
Someone reported that possums and/or squirrels now drop intestines. Haven't seen it myself.
---
His loot has been level 30 or so for me so it isnt extremely worth it for most of us anyway. 
---
Limited time events seem to be pretty positive. The event is casual enough to not be some difficult grind and you get to experience it with at least 1/4 of the server because most people want something from the event.
---
It is a little tedious, as the robots take forever to walk, [but it's also opened up opportunities for random photos with strangers](https://imgur.com/a/5G06lkB) so it's not even that big of a negative. It's pretty nice.
---
So it's been a day now. When does it start? Is it really a certain time of day? 
---
Have At Ye!
---
Did you buy the plans or mods?
---
Plans will give you the ability to craft the units, as long as your perks are high enough.
---
Mods will allow you to build once, or on one piece of armor.
---
While it is awesome to see so many players together in one place, I have seen the event used as an area to murder other players. My husband and I did the event at least 6 times last night. 2 of those times multiple people attempted to kill me. To the point that i am on pacifist and I could damage them because they had become hostile after murdering my husband. They kept chasing me and for once melee was not on their sides. I killed 3 people in self defense. All at this event. Craziness. I have about 300 hours in and until now had only killed 2 people. I hope players that are less able of defending themselves are not attacked. Mind you, this happened AFTER the event had ended and we were looking at our new prizes.
---
I went and started a location list. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b37e70/if\_you\_find\_a\_stealth\_boy\_in\_the\_wild\_please\_let/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b37e70/if_you_find_a_stealth_boy_in_the_wild_please_let/) if you find any that are not on the list let me know.

I get 150 Mbps down , 20 up and virtually no hangups. It's not my connection. Since we all have to share information with each other though it could very well have been someone else's internet.
---
This almost happened when a griefer attacked me repeatedly and I had just gotten the electrically charged mutation.  They did some damage to me, but more to themselves and almost died.  I kept up with stimpacks and they gave up and harassed a bunch of other people.  This was a couple patches ago though.  Dunno about today.
---
Whaaaaa, I lost fictional resources whaaaaaa
---
Your comments are irrelevant to this thread.
---
So nice

It seems highly counter-intuitive that the "rare" masks will drop when robots will die. Updating m post with this info.

have you updated your drivers or could it be something like your AMD processor not playing nice with your NVIDIA graphics card?
---
I mean I run a laptop with a  intel i7-8750H/12GB RAM/GTX 1050 Ti and run everything just fine on the high settings.
---
No, it's not the black excavator paint.  It's the "Blue/Red" version... Black still pending, along with the chromed/gold Handmade.
---
Yes, several times. No luck. Suck of brewing rum... 
---
I have a recipe for it... 1,500 caps
---
u/ladydevann, u/valseek, u/LoneVaultWanderer u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
It's capped at something like 90%, but people running similar builds are damn near immortal unless you're hitting them with crits (which ignore all of that). 
---
I killed a couple opossums today and I got intestines along with their meat and I was like wtf?! But now I understand why lol! Thank you!
---
No, it's just the impression you gave. I'm speaking from personal experience so. Maybe I'm just better at bobbing and weaving than you are. Nothing personal here, it's regretful that you took it that way 
---
If it gives someone like you wood, it is griefing.
---
Haven't had a bad set of people yet but i've also not had a nuke dropped on me while doing it so. Probably just lucky.
---
Some people are bored and just swing around in pacifist mode killing time. Relax. 
---
And here I am not even sure where to go for the event or what it is.
---
Other ways to troll, 
---
Block path of robots with power armour 
---
Don't help defend robots even though your there and shooting at nothing but the sky.
---
Go to a real DMV. Get fed up and leave after an hour. Now go back and tell everyone you get to resume where you left off instead of starting over.
---
Then duck.
---
That’s were I got them 🤭
---
What if I use field surgeon and normal stims?
---
I just did the mask event and equipped a level 5 shovel and i was still one hit kill on the enemies but the low levels couldn't kill the suiciders quick enough so we lost 3 robots. Its not always easy to let them tag enemies. 
---
I'm on the latest non-beta drivers for everything in the case.
---
I had a 1080 Ti and just did a Step-Up.  The 1080 Ti was running fine plugged into my 4k TV!  When I swapped my backup 970 in, I never changed the settings back from Ultra, and I didn't notice much of a difference in performance.  I mean, I didn't measure it with an FPS counter, and I'm sure there must've been *some* difference...but I didn't notice it.  I *do* notice rubber banding and disconnects.  And crashing.  And hangs.  This game is a hot mess.
---
Is anything blueprinted?
---
I'm able to meet up for the next few hours. Let me know
---
It's the barbed heated pitchfork that makes it look like a trident.
---
Oh well now that I know you’re not afraid 😱 
---
I beg to differ. That is exactly how I remember the Orange County DMV working.
---
How does one trigger the event? I’ve played all day and Helvetia is empty.
---
Share? I'd love to see!
---
Ive probably rebuilt 20+ times before getting to this, and every time I learn something new or find something I want to refine for next time.. including this time xD
---
LOL someone hear other than me has some time in Rust. Ya, I have spent literal days fighting guys in towers like that. I dont have anyone on my team with wrecking ball but a fat man makes such a loud noise it is hard to figure out where it was fired from and more than one of us has a TS/aim damage/90%WR fatman in the bank somewhere.  
---
The fatman was the go to way to grief bases before using orbital strikes really gained popularity but orbital strikes use raw flux and that makes them cheap. I can see a guy dropping a death tower at the very start of combat but fights are not going to be prolonged and good pvpers from open pvp games like Rust or even the Darkzone in the original The Division make players come to them and dont push without a good advantage. 
---
It is a cool idea and I kinda hope they increase building hp so we can have people dropping walls in pvp but in general 4 guys with orbital strikes, TS FM, and or Nuka nades are going to make it hard guys that drop bases. There is a vendor that sells nuka quantum after all. 
---
Thank you :D
---
My guy stabs people with it, so that's weird that yours doesn't.
---
99% of issues people experiencing with FO76 are on the user's end. Check your settings and ensure your AV software isn't interfering with the game.  Having the "top of the line" hardware doesn't mean it won't cause any issues either. Sometimes you have to wait for the drivers to be updated that are compatible with the software you're using.
---
Also, you could be nicer to people that are trying to help you, even if it is their job.
---
well, some buildings in game have a good lighting, at least better than the one in camps, below some examples i took today (image are screenshots without any filter or manipulation):
---
[In-game screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/LBjWa2o)
---
The lighting problem seem to be more relevant on camp, example: [screenshot of my camp room](https://imgur.com/a/uKy8O3T).
---
in my opinion, a camp room without lights should be more like this than the one before:[screenshot of my camp room edited](https://imgur.com/a/V3Rt7dG), or just a little lighter, but for sure not like the first screenshot XD
---
Are you on Xbox? I took a snapshot of myself inside someone's base with this exact layout a couple of weeks ago. 
---
thats totaly not true, i prefere discord but alot of clans and older players (mid 20's) still use ts3. the last 6 months all my guilds/clans uses ts3, from wow to fallout 76 to division 2. 
---
That's all you really need. I wanted a flamingo fence but ran out of space
---
I had this. Some troubleshooting showed me that even though I have Win10 set to only download and install patches when I tell it to, it was downloading and installing a patch on the sly. 
---
Aw wow thank you!
---
Was going to say the same thing. One time I didn't get anything :(
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer_here_list_of_all_fasnacht_rewards_and/ This post contradicts what the dev's say within the games own code.

Neat! I'm on PC so it wasn't me
---
It is not a game breaking thing but pls have a look, thanks :)

Honestly I'm starting to get furious with Bethesda at this point
---
That sounds awesome. The red and blue work really well together
---
if you are on PC I will help you learn the games, answer questions, and help you get what you need tonight.
---
there's a bug in the code that makes it mathematically impossible to get a rare mask
---
Pretty sure those challenges are there to force players to cooperate. Same goes for "revive a teammate" or "trade with another player" ones.
---
Yeah for me too, my settlement building in FO4 grew in size &amp; ambition the more I built &amp; I’m happy with the end results &amp; love that my hard working settlers have nice places to live in 😊
---
Its Very exciting....😂
---
It's great. I have played this game every single day since I got it. I haven't even finished FO4 or Skyrim SE because of this game. What platform are you on?
---
Different leather - it probably only works on light leather.
---
Am I the only one on PC who is getting INSANE lag spikes in Helvitica? Usually I load a server. NO quests appear and it says I am overemcumbered. I walk a few steps, and suddenly I am not encumbered as I guess it loaded my perks. Then i am standing in front of the restaurant and try to pick up the blue dog bowl and I can't. Then some of the town loads again. Then the scortched load. Then the blue bowl disappears.  Then my quests appear, then the event items appear. Like, this usually takes a good 3 minutes upon loading the server. I have been half way through the quest before the robots in the quest actually loaded. 
---
dude, the interior of your base is sick. Well done. 
---
Yeah I’m hoping they at least double the health of bases.  I really don’t see very many people carrying nuka grenades, air strikes(they’re really expensive) and mininukes are expensive but there’s always a chance. Overall I believe my build will work agains most people, of course there’s flaws because there’s only so many Options but I think for most situations it will work.
---
Really thought a small fee was gonna be 3 or 4 hundred 😂 
---
Scraping a leg piece can give you mods for arm, leg, or even torso.  So you may have unlocked the mods for the other pieces.  There is very little description in the unlock message for what piece it is actually for. 
---
Arg I know how you feel! I missed out on the recent green fern floor tiles- they look hillarious and ugly as heck but still sad I missed them.
---
Theyll probably recycle them after a few months
---
Me too. Seems like the 100 % casuals are here to stay
---
Anyone got an idea on how much the Balloons plans are worth I've gotten two people wanting to trade for it but dont jnow what it's worth 
---
I have seen this 2 times both times were north of the munitions factory, 1st time it said it would explode then he laughed and said he took a shot to the gut and I could have it.. 2nd time he said to get out of it because he went looking for a fusion core.. pretty cool I captured it on xbox
---
Yes I am on PC, thank you! Glad you liked it :D
---
Explore. There are Easter eggs everywhere. 
---
Grind money, set goals
---
Go event hopping, 
---
Lots of stuff to do
---
That sucks. On Xbox all you have to do is change language and it doesn't affect anything besides the language. No need to re-download or any of that problematic mumbo jumbo.
---
Hah a little bit yes, thanks!
---
I shoulda grabbed some snaps but I really dig your place, I can only hope my nukashine addiction loosens and I can rebuild a beautiful home like this one someday.
---
They do. Was going after squirrels at the Whitespring to get the weekly challenge and picked up intestines from them.
---
Nope :( really sucks cause i was about to pimp my bar with balloons and some inacurate swiss flags
---
Yeah me too, plus I love looking at the map &amp; seeing that another player is at my camp using my workbenches &amp; hopefully cooking up a nice bit of radroach 😊
---
PS4 btw
---
i assume everyone knows the sjw russian who chase player with duped items while using the same duped stuff their own. but blaming or alerting everyone becouse you feel uncomfortly with someone once blamed you false isn't a reason to cry here. this seems to be a legit cheated item, no clothing or something as you see in the screenshot. so your argument is totaly failed here. being salty is also a faggot move but hey, internet nowdays. everyone is rude and harsh aslong they sit infront their pc.
---
# look at the damn screenshot and you'll see this isnt a trapper chest or bos clothing. it's a freaking BACKPACK 
---
got it?
---
actually my information isnt incorrect about the datamining at all. ive been working on this stuff for a while now. i actually have a lot more information about the game in general due to the amount of time ive spent doing research. 
---
Anything in defence in building takes up a lot of the building budget.
---
I've done the event 3 times. I got 2 giant masks and 1 fachtooth(I think that's what it was called) mask. Is there a list of drops from the event somewhere?
---
You sure that screenshot proof wasn’t from fallout 4? Or from out of the dev room on PC?
---
100% witch masks for me so far
---
It could’ve been on pc but i see no reason for it not to be on console
---
Feels like perk cards should be adjustable while sleeping too. Have a hardcore mode where you can only change em while sleeping.
---
I’ve heard that this happens to a lot of people. Luckily it doesn’t seem to be TOO common. There is always gonna be assholes in a game like this, but at least they’re normally few and far between. Hope you guys have better luck in the future, and happy Fasnacht! 😁
---
Includes shared bedroom, a swamp-pond pool and all the giant mutated bats you can eat.
---
Please don't get your hair caught in the water purifiers as we don't have insurance.
---
Yeah I thought so too, but I remember a team mate back in November said that they used to lose whatever charge you had when you reloaded, so I'm guessing that's how they work after being patched. 
---
I agree, but you also mention the number they are compared to
---
&gt; The problem is that of the 5 masks that nobody has received, all 5 have an additional chance requirement, it generates a random number(between 0 and 1) and compares it to another to see if you get the mask. The problem is it seems that second number it compares it to is 1.
---
Is this second figure a variable that may be affected by the number of surviving robots? Surviving with only 1 robot would mean you only have a 50% chance at getting a mask, and then the rare or uncommon mask would have to be picked, but having that check number reduced by loosing robots would unlock the rare masks.
---
It could’ve been, the only way to get it that i know of is from the dev room and you get the recipe when you scrap it
---
*sigh* you're right. I didn't even use the full build area. So lazy. 
---
I'd best start over.
---
Anti-vaxxer also do some research, that doesn’t mean the research amounts to anything credible.
---
the timer in the games files says 1800 seconds which is 30 minutes
---
What’s worse is mass scrapping low level weapons and then the UI shifting you down one to your 3* weapons
---
*lol* thanks
---
Depends on the % it procs at and the goal is to have it prock multiple times. If it procks at 40-50% hp and you dont heal past that immediately it does not reset. So it procs on damage that is 1 shot and it will take a half second for it to administer the heal that is usually you taking a second heavy hit before the heal. You can actually die in between and it sucks to be on the floor with full hp. Super stim pack is 80% heal and on my PA farmer I have never had it fail me with super stims but it has failed with normals but maybe my connection was just bad. Test it for yourself.  
---
I’ve noticed this world wide for a while. What I’ve noticed is that once you hear your radio kick on, the server should be mostly loaded. A lot of items and quests won’t appear properly until that happens. It’s obviously on Bethesda’s end, and hopefully it gets better in the future.
---
Dude chill, thing was fixed like 6 hours ago.
---
Yeah I definitely agree. Seems obvious to add
---
you learn this when you pick up royal jelly
---
Don't have the recipe? FIND SOMEONE THAT DOES! It is a multiplayer game for crying out loud. The challenge isn't locked behind rng its locked behind your refusal to interact with other players.
---
Field surgeon makes stims work twice as fast. I mean if I use the medic pump, that perk and normal stims
---
Are you online? 
---
That’s what I thought but I’ve picked up royal jelly a few times
---
&gt; Same problem here in Germany
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Edit: Changing to English does not help either
---
Please elaborate. The game is working just fine for me? German version, digital, works in both German and English. [And also in Italian.](https://i.imgur.com/00i2jFr.jpg)

 Find a nice gun. Make it a project.
---
 Have enough caps to jump on something, I bought my Instigating Lever Action from Wallace. for about 380 caps. I could not believe it, took it home and souped it up. ;) That's another thing though, building them. I have scrapped maybe 80 - 100 Lever Actions. ;)
---
Well, tbh I hope it doesn't mean we've gone too far with stash size and settlement budget. Because I really like where we are, and I'd hate to have to go back, but I do want more stability. 
---
Walk In Clinic?
---
Planned Parenthood?

Not-A-Murder-Hospital?
---
Eh, this is how some people play all the time, minus the guilt later. It's a legitimate way to play as well. Raiders in the previous games were out to kill you, and steal your possessions. So, you were, by your actions, a raider out to score some easy junk. The level 9 will probably go to their friends that play F76 and they could mount retaliation. Or they might get into dumping their junk into their own stash more often. Keep playing!
---
it isn't all about fallout 76, i always blure out my spec, gear and inventory. always. i have installed sharex to do it quickly for that purpose. you don't like it? think i'm cheating? idk, not my busines. please, stop complaining about other doing strange stuff in your eyes, i have my reasons to do so and learned that the hard way. missed worldrank #3 raidprogress becouse of that. this thread is about where this backpack is or if it's legit at all. not why i blure my inventory out of habit.
---
Ok, I get that going to the DMV is a hassle, I’ve been there myself... 
---
But leaving a DMV doesn’t make my mail with stampage disappear, it doesn’t magically remove my application stamped by the governor from my hand, it doesn’t destroy my birth certificate or license or anything like that. I wouldn’t mind waiting in line again, the problem is that you have to collect EVERY ONE of the annoying fetch items again, no matter how close you were to the end of the quest when it restarted.
---
this. They're artificially making the cash shop look more enticing.
---
No AV software.  Windows Firewall is disabled.  Mic access to all apps is opened through Group Policy, sidestepping the privacy setting (I've seen folks say that was an issue, but 76 isn't listed in the apps to give explicit access).
---
"Nicer"...?!  Because I asked if they were a bot?  They tried to tell me green was red and I called them out on it.  That's not rude--it's to the point.  I legit thought they might be a bot.  All the previous CS folks have been polite, even when they haven't been helpful.  And none of them have been so completely and utterly wrong about a tech fact.
---
*"99% of issues people experiencing with FO76 are on the user's end."*
---
Now THAT'S not "nice".  You might as well say "99% of the problem with 76 is the users".  Even if you're right (I personally don't think so), that's pretty arrogant and insulting.

What I was thinking too. My issue with the Summer mask is it's just a recolor of Winter. The moon looks unique though, so between the two it's clear what I'd buy.
---
Know what else is really stupid? You thinking you're being "forced" to read this thread, much less reply to it. Grow up and move on, downvote if you want.

Thanks :D

This is a masterpiece! Excellent work!

Bro if you’re trying to give someone tips then give it to the OP, don’t reply to my comment and try to teach me how to pick perk cards. It’s a pretty simple thing to do and if you really want to educate people then make a post saying “how to maximize damage for noobs”. 
---
You assumed a lot with your statement and I find it annoying. Please upload a video of you beating an ass/sent player with your 0 legendary build and I will kiss the ground on which you walk, until then you’re just grandstanding. And please quote how I give the impression of someone who “quits before the battle even starts”. 
---
I’ve got 300 confirmed kills and god tier gear and I can still be objective and see the balancing issues. Yet you sit here and try to tell me you can take me out with no legendary gear? Come on bruh that’s such a ridiculous statement.
---
Anyone on PS4 down to fight this kid so he can test his bob and weave on your legendary build? I’d pay real world money to watch that.

Shows you the current countdown to when each nuke is ready for launch so you don't go through the trouble of running the full silo only to get to the launch computer and get told it's still building a new nuke for 2 hours and change.

Well I wish you luck, and hit me up with your findings on the medic pump. Like I said I have not tried it in a long time on anything other than the excavator my farmer wears 100% of the time. In the past it would mutli proc on excavator, x-01, and 45. I never tested t-51 or t-60. Have fun!

I actually don’t have a problem using the existing emotes (or my mic) to tell a person that I don’t want their “help”.  I’ll use the thumbs down, vomit and ghoul emotes, or I’ll switch my mic on and politely tell them they’re interfering with my plans.
---
If the high level player doesn’t take the hint (or ignores my obvious message), I’ll watch for them to hopefully return to their camp then I’ll pay them a visit.  Chances are really good I’ll die, but payback’s a b%+&amp;h.
---
It does look a little like that.. wish we had some more window options.
---
I didn't think of it that way :) and yeah it's the spirit of the game
---
Oh no! Hang in there. I also got 3 owl masks too so you're sure to at least get am owl soon. 
---
That's why I take the toilet paper
---
done the event maybe 30+ times and haven't even seen anyone else wearing any of the goblin/jester/skull/sun/old man winter masks, drop rate seems incredibly low
---
dont think its avail
---
*lol* well it would give me an excuse to build again xD
---
Man, you really need to check out Fallout 4 then. you're going to never play another game again.
---
I would say "Wow!", but having dealt with incompetent tech support all too often, I am no longer surprised.  
---
I did tech support back in the earl;y '90s.  I have a Comp. Sci. Degree, yet I still hate having to deal with the first tier tech support.
---
I even took the floppy out before I rebooted.
---
so u have 15 masks
---
Honestly, if they removed all the pointless items like burnt books from the world it would likely help out a noticeable amount. I also think the servers are just lagging a bit more lately because players have been returning to the game. This is definitely a good thing, but I’m not sure it was accounted for. And I wouldn’t worry about them reducing stash size, I find that incredibly unlikely.
---
Don't buy then.  Jesus, you act like you are entitled to them.
---
I can say that I have only 8gb ram an i5 3,7ghz and a gtx 780 card on a W7 system and running everything on ultra no problem. So yes I think its super weird how the instability issues are hitting the even more upgraded systems. 
---
Kinda makes me scared to upgrade my pc lol. Seen a couple of really good setups that shouldnt struggle at all and then they do.
---
Like its supposed to get better and smoother as you upgrade right not the other way.
---
I think this is super weird.
---
That dude is pretty funny. I didn't know he started 76 videos. Thanks!
---
Agreed! Can't wait to see what they do bring out.
---
Do you have mutations? There are two that cause dmg to others if they hit you and your mutation hits them back it just flagged you for pvp.
---
It's called 'rare' for a reason son.
---
not trying to sound like a smart *** but u have to go into your pip boy to do that
---
Have you tried uninstalling it and playing something else because Bethesda won't fix their shit?
---
Awesome info, thank you!! I'm excited to get some of this stuff again and turn into the invisible sneak like you described lol
---
Nope. Its 6x5x4x8x2x4x3x.... I forget what else is in there but I lost my sanity somewhere in the middle.
---
I've experienced literally all of this in the past few days. I've just upgraded my PC too, so I'm pretty sure it's not on my end. The food crashing one is really annoying. Russian roulette with a survival mechanic isn't fun. 
---
My name is PeachieBear lol
---
Not sure about the food consuming thing, but the camp loading slow I've experienced when porting into a world with the world event in progress.
---
its helpful from inside the whitespring resort (which takes forever to enter or leave)
---
Building is definitely my favorite pastime on there. Nice way to chill a day away 
---
gatta agree with all that, i did kinda want the summer one because i love the red but that moon one is great
---
I might have one spare... pc?
---
Lol. There are pictures all over reddit. I received the toothy man mask and saw people doing the event with the owl mask.
---
Ok. 
---
I love how in this age of gaming that youtubers have such an impact on games. I've been playing since the BETA and I am still having fun with it. Just going to say make your own decision on something, don't take some asshat on you tube that just wants to put a game down to make a few bucks opinion on a game. Try it out and if you don't like it, you don't like it.
---
I totally 100% agree! 3rd time I’ve done it (although I glitched the second time so I, and I think everyone else hopped servers) and it’s such a buzz! Everyone coming together, having a photo at the end, so good! I think k after the rocky road that has been fallout 76, Bethesda have done a really good thing with this event 
---
I would wait until the event is over before selling anything.  if doing a trade for something you don't have that may be another matter.
---
Yeah, im waiting for that post where " i got 1 shotted by this guy, im level 250+ plus and bloodied build and he's not taking any damage" dude killed himself basically, i just blocked his hits with 50% damage reflected to attacker while blocking / executioners sword, along with assassins/ sentinels it didn't take much for him to drop himself. I mean PvP can be fun so long as you don't rage fight, its not like your loosing anything IRL. 
---
Please keep this post updated because I have several mask duplicates (yes I have all mask that I’m aware drop ATM) one beret and missing like two plans. I’m dying to get hands on, jester(my fav),sun ,Devil, and I believe it’s called skeleton mask. 
---
If you want Shotgun, then you need a ton of points in Strength.  
---
Shotgunner, Expert Shotgunner, and Master Shotgunner alone is 9 ranks.
---
Thats really how it is! Lol and yea If I get on later Ill try and get some pics. I decided to move to the Toxic Valley so its easier/cheaper to fast travel whem im with my friends
---
Me too! 
---
I never lock my doors, I prefer that folks come and visit. I like that we can add to the scenery of the game and our camps can be explored just as much as you'd explore a town.
---
scary right??? but ive learned that if you make a new loot bag close to where it dropped..all the items should appear in the new bag
---
those are masks that are available. there are 5: owl, soldier, toothy man, witch and giant.
---
this is discussing the "rare" drops that have not been documented as dropping by anyone yet. 
---
We both know the real reason you blur it out just like we both know why you know about the pack. Shitbirds of a feather stay together.  
---
*lol* thankfully all earned via challenges. 
---
Dangit now its in my head too. 
---
Id be cool with laying in bed using your pipboy too. Takes longer to feels well rested. Or maybe you don't get "well rested." Just recuperated 
---
Are you going to do this over the weekend?
---
I think twice as fact is only the heal over time and that will actually work against the build. The idea is to have the stim instant heal you though incoming damage and have the heal over time as a side benefit. People outside of PA have to do an entire animation to heal but PA gets the heal much faster but still there is a delay and you can die in the delay if your stim was not strong enough to counter the damage it to to proc and the incoming damage to get it to the reset point so it does it again. 
---
He's not your friend.
---
I always have my mic, but am usually in a party chat or team chat. I have, on occasion, switched over to area chat to speak with someone. If I'm by myself, my mic is on mute unless I'm near someone.

For sure!

Despite the comment to be "nicer" above, I'm actually really patient and generally bite my tongue.  No point in doing otherwise.  An example of the type of interaction I usually have with CS, from the previous chat: [https://imgur.com/a/nWraOgZ](https://imgur.com/a/nWraOgZ)
---
Polite but persistent wins every time!
---
You are both monsters! 🤣
---
From what another Redditor said they found while data mining that the drop rate is so low it's actually not possible to obtain.
---
Dupers=Gay
---
Oh god.. I crashed my version of FO4 with my 7 story glass window castle on the island.. couldn't leave the island without the game completely panic-crashing *lol* I had an entire bottom floor with nothing but kennels for all the wolves and dogs you can buy.
---
Agreed
---
Okay, ill add you when i get back on. I'll also give you plans and recipes i had collected. And maybe get you that fusion generator plan if haven't gotten it already,  its way much better than those other generators and produces 100 energy. That'll help you save space and camp budget. 
---
1) Weekly challenge
---
2) Players are free to claim or contest any workshop they want.
---
3) Your summary of the interaction did not include any event considered griefing.
---
It would have been nice to simply have the masks on a knock out list.... when you get a mask, you cannot get it again until you have all masks, or the odds of getting the other masks get weighted to favour the ones you dont have
---
The new poles from the parade? I think theyre just decoration like the skull topped raider poles.
---
I have those perks maxed 
---
I'm acting like I'm entitled to the "free available masks through an in-game event" because I believe that Bethesda is purposely leaving the best masks out of the event until after their cash shop mask has had a chance to make money?
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
Thanks! Im only at 165ish
---
Whitesprings, Westtek, rinse and repeat.
---
Would love to see your build. Open plan can be the hardest to arrange without the floor looking empty.
---
yeah sure sherlock. idiots like you don't know how to deal pvp, same like you distrust me like i distrust others. so either way, no matter what you saying, i'm right only with the fact you are mad at not seeing my inventory.
---
what shall be there? think i have thousands of backpacks and ask here why he had one and where it comes? shouldn't i know it then?  
---
this whole discussion is about nothing, just someone who isn't respecting the topic and blaming others for no reason. people like you are cancer for this and every other comunity, the whole internet and mankind. 
---
I'm sure you are smart enough to realize I'm not talking about people aren't even doing slap damage. That's called willful ignorance.
---
LOL and in just 3 days xD 
---
My first thought was that it could be an image from when people were accessing the dev room on PC, but it looks like the screenshot is from a PS4 user.
---
On xbone.  That's what I had to do
---
EL Jorge44
---
Just doing another parade event right now
---
Yep, useful in places like the Wendigo cave cos I have no sense of direction (IRL and in this game), so end up going round in circles..
---
Oh god, I am so sorry lol.
---
And since it's in the atom store they are plans, no need to worry about scrapping them by accident.
---
I never bother with blueprinting- I very rarely move camp. If I do then I just store and rebuild elsewhere.
---
You aren't entitled to have the masks.  They're rare drops.  Get over it.
---
100% correct :D 
---
Well far as I know its not punishable as people unknowingly picked them up and if you scrapped it you learned the plan. People opened tickets and asked if using it was a bannable offence and they replied that they when asking their supervisor they were told that the marine combat armor helmet is already avalable in the game. So I think they let that one slide.
---
I spoke to someone that reached out to bethesda, I dont know how to put pictures in my post can someone help with that. But I have a screenshot of a reply to someone I know, bethesda stated they unbanned some accounts to see if it would harm server stability and with the ridiculous amounts of items duper’s were still holding in their inventory they decided to just reban everyone (why didn’t they just remove all the clutter and duped shot from duper’s inventories fuck sake bethesda!!!!!)
---
Yeah it was actually too rowdy to see much of what was going on (which was awesome) so a nearby ridge would have been prime seating. I'd wager there will be similar situations at more parades. Reserve your seat in advance! 
---
I dismantled a shielded Enclave undersuit due to lag. Had to refarm the flux and masses. Wasn't bad but wasn't fun.
---
I'm here now.  How do I start the event?  Or how often is it triggered?
---
We know...
---
Loving the split level effect on this build.
---
Is there anything that suggests rolls change based on number of participants that have masks equipped? I know the Historian says something about "everyone participating in the parade donning the masks" 
---
That would be one way of doing it but oddly enough walls are perfectly happy to stack on top of each other and attach to roof pieces too. There were no tricks needed to get them to be where they are. 
---
Sold a couple and dropped some in the Overseers stash, but hell I seriously cannot get Giant or Bucktooth :/ Also of all the times, I only got the berret yellow hat thing once.
---
Same if you get in to and out of power armour with a mask on, then take it off.
---
I had it last week. It was that the server was being worked on.  
---
Thanks! *lol* sure, if I ever work out how..
---
Thanks! :D
---
Alright, let's take this slow. This is unconfirmed (and personally i think it's just a bug) but IF, IF, IF Bethesda was purposely leaving the best masks out of the parade until the last few days of the event to generate more interest in their in-game cash shop, do you think that's a fair way of having an event, despite leading us to believe that all masks are currently available?
---
I have spent the past two days farming this event and have more of these than I can count...
---
* Owl Mask
---
* Witch Mask
---
* Toothy Man Mask
---
* Soldier Mask
---
* Giant Mask 
---
...but I have yet to see these drop for anyone...
---
* Jester Mask
---
* Goblin Mask
---
* Winter Man Mask
---
* Sun mask
---
* Skull Mask
---
Maybe I should kill the robots wearing them and see if I can take them from their remains. :)
---
I had to do this today twice. At least is spawns eventually, although I tend to disconnect about once an hour so everything is a gamble.
---
this, i've done it multiple times and not only have i not got one to drop for myself, i've not even seen anyone else with one
---
Fuck your "friend". Get some other friends to play with, the dude sounds like a real douche.
---
I doubt the developers are going to revamp the game significantly.  It will be KoS, no butterfly pacifist mode.  Mobs may be harder to kill or players will take more damage (perhaps lower stats on weapons and apparel, PA actually rare/challenging to acquire).
---
PvE servers will still have their griefers, because griefers gonna grief, with or without PvP.
---
youll know when it's "ready"
---
No need to do anything to trigger it per say, just hop til it says event&gt; talk to master of ceremonies
---
I suck at reddit I can't figure out how to post this screenshot I just took but has anyone seen a mask that has red hair and a big nose almost like a clown? I haven't seen this listed as a possible faschnact drop?
---
Thanks :) I wouldn't have realized it unless you pointed it out lol
---
Very very slowly.  Legit maybe about level 40 ish.  Used BUGS to cheat my ass up to 100.   
---
That actually seems like a good plan. The event area is pretty big, so you could watch and still get rewards at the end.
---
You are somehow confused how this is not game breaking.  Sorry bud, I just won't be able to pull your blinders off.  I mean when I can't even SEE my camp to build it.  When camp entities vanish but never really go completely away by staying in the budget.  When server instability keeps you from playing.  When you have invisible enemies.  I'm sorry dude.  I guess we have different ideas of what is game breaking.
---
43 here. Huge Fallout fan since 1. Killed my first scorch beast at lvl 30 with a puny 10mm, took me well over one hour but at least I didn't die. In fact i had to bring its attention back 3 times because it flew away from me out of boredom. Now I'm lvl 90 and happily jumping around in this awesome environment, occasionally waving to other players swooshing by. 
---
I play solo, no mic, female. Always been a gamer and always will be. 
---
Join my game you can probably catch a free reward lol
---
It’s sad that so many players are fixated on the chance of acquiring shiny loot.
---
because then it's no longer the easiest lol.  :P
---
Old Man Summer is already available. It's Moonshine Mama that goes up for sale on the 21st.
---
I'll come take a peek
---
I found T-60 at a bot vendor, so I switched my X-01 jet pack PA to use T-60 legs. It's way cheaper to repair T-60 pieces, as a bonus. 
---
Uhhh your loot chances go DOWN if any of the robots die
---
Well thank you kind sir! 
---
Sure!
---
use a cooking fire to get behind the invisible barrier 
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck on nuking Helvetia forever.
---
Thanks! Was the only way to build around a tricky patch of very flat to suddenly very uneven ground. It wasnt something Id tried before.
---
The only way I found to get that half rise is to place your first foundation piece low (so the piece at the next height wont be floating) and then use the ramp foundation piece, snap the next flat foundation piece to the highest point on the ramp. Replace the ramp piece with a flat foundation piece and then snap the foundation stairs to the higher piece.
---
It starts every 30 minutes or so. There should be a pop up server wide when it’s about to start, so you should be able to do other tasks while you wait. I tend to just hang out with whoever is currently in Helvetia though.
---
Server crashed I'll be back in a few. Sorry
---
What he said ^ :D
---
nice i only did it once and have the soldier mask..also review the notes in you pipboy..u should have plans also as rewards for the event
---
Damn really? I’ve seen the datamined posts but wow, but of a miss on bethesda’s side, the rarity needs to be a bit less “rare”!
---
*lol* thanks!
---
Well, I just got a duplicate mask. I now know what I must do.
---
I figured out the star on my compass. It is a shared quest marker, so a marker for a teammates quest. 
---
Wow Bethesda back at it again slapping big you thought you could get all the masks. What makes me mad is they haven't responded anywhere. 
---
*lady xD but thanks!
---
Aw sorry to hear. 
---
Ah yes I do have a mutation that causes area damage and another that when I get melee attacked does damage.
---
But I don't under stand when I have a full set of 3* marine armour that they can 1 shot me or that they 1 shot me in Xo1
---
Yeah believe so, check fromt page of the reddit and there should be a datamined post I just recently saw, it shows what seems to be confirmed as drops and whats not confirmed.
---
Here is where I found that information if anyone is looking for a different marker
---
http://www.brandongamer.com/reviews/The-Complete-Fallout-76-Game-Manual/#compass
---
I think your confused by the wording. When it says robots destroyed its not telling you how many you HAVE to be destroyed 
---
You need to keep them functioning till the end
---
What system? 
---
Chances are you may not have spent much time around the Ash Heap region.  If you have, you likely haven’t spent much time in the Grafton area of the Toxic Valley.  It becomes a bit of grind around level 30, but appreciate the opportunity to explore the game.  The common theme for higher levels is the lack of endgame content and the faceroll through enemies.
---
They've said your rewards change depending on how many robots survive
---
System?
---
I take it all!
---
Lol I ain’t mad, not even close. In fact quite the contrary. You amuse me.  
---
Yeah seen em, starting to get doubles but no recipes! XD Was blessed with a plan for the bon fire though, which I guess makes up for it
---
Disregard. I see you're PC. I'm ps4 
---
Way to throw out a label to disparage a whole group of people you ignorant imbecile.  
---
its the monster mask from the monster mash event.  people duped them and are able to keep them after the event.
---
The system doesn’t matter.  Just log in, dump it at the Overseer’s Camp, and re-roll!
---
Says youre offline
---
For sure system 
---
I am on PS4 and my dudes are almost blind apparently. Since day one. 
---
Hell, I got baited by a low level shooting my turrets at my camp. When  I fast travelled there, his buddy, a level 200 shot me with an explosive weapon. Pop! Dead! Junk stolen, all my black Titanium, screws, springs etc. That was about 80 levels ago for me. Still annoys the heck outta me, but it is how some people play.
---
What platform XB1, PS4, PC etc.
---
Dude, pretty flippin sweet! The view is killer! 
---
Nope definitely online. What’s ur gt and I’ll invite you instead
---
Random is random.  Participate in more parades.
---
Dont think it matters if you stay or move. But it is very important(to my understanding) to keep as many robots alive throughout the parade as you can. 
---
As the surviving robots are used to calculate number of drops, though it doesnt effect rarity to my knowledge. A datamine was published this morning reguarding it. Ill link it if I can find it.
---
I only occasionally get random disconnects from the game. My mic works perfectly in the game (even though I don't use it much). Am I just this lucky? What about all the other people that have almost no problems? I'm quite certain your set-up is what's causing your issues. 
---
No Firewall enabled?! No Antivirus?! Whatever you did to your PC raises some questions right there alone.
---
And yes, be nice to people. No need to sound like an ass if somebody may have made a mistake or said something that may not be accurate. Again, that person (not a bot) was trying to help you. Be more considerate.
---
You're place is awesome!! 
---
Yeah just accidentally scrapped the last one I got from you lol, can I grab a shielded raider leathers?
---
Lol no it isn't. This kind of data is taken from the live version of the game client that is released to players. In fact, Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 are governed by the same ToS, and the ESO community manager [has specifically said](https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/1582622/#Comment_1582622) "Datamining information isn't illegal or against the TOS...". Nice try though.
---
Everyone thinks they have a great idea on how to NOT have to scrounge for junk resources in a game built around that very idea.
---
Screws, gears, springs. They are far more common than people think they are.
---
There’s so many areas to explore and find.
---
Same name. I messaged you on live
---
Thanks g
---
I am on PC
---
My XBox is on my computer desk.  The desk is from IKEA.  Why does that matter?
---
How does it not matter if hes giving it away?
---
So we know where to find you
---
I kill low levels all the time. 
---
😩 xbox.
---
He can dump it and start fresh without waiting for someone here.
---
Nice levels. Kramer would be mighty envious.
---
of course, i think ive got the shielded long johns ready, same perks as leathers just looks different, i can do the leathers im just a little shy on cork.
---
 I spent the two weeks prior to this last update not playing, because I would get disconnected about thirty seconds after spawning. I ended up just jumping in daily with enough time to farm the easier Daily atomic challenges, so at least I could have that. It's leveled off now, but I still get disconnected at least once an hour.
---
They're oddly pedantic pieces to use- they don't behave like other walls. Normal walls and triangle pieces have a pretty high tolerance to what they'll snap to- the inverted full wall triangle doesn't like to snap Anywhere- including in a space that its clearly built for. You have to mess around with removing what it perceives to be in it's way (lit. Everything).
---
Ps- I also had some of the half wall slanted pieces but they do not play nice- 4 of them stacked together to fill a gap will connect to each other for all eternity and refuse to be moved due to "supporting" each other. They also clip into each other all on their own and will cause a game crash if you try to break them up- you have to relog to fix it.
---
Never mind
---
Alright, when I’m ready, I’ll save some stuff for you.
---
if that's the case, then that's a pretty crappy move by the devs, they may aswell not put them in at all
---
Me too! Really excited to be able to decorate with actual items:D
---
* Water purifiers need electricity and water to work (except for the level 1 purifier that looks like a pump). They all have varying degrees of electricity required to function, each increasing more than the next. Power up the purifiers by hooking them up to an electricity source and setting them up in water. Every 5 minutes you will get 1 purified water in one of your tanks. 
---
The more purifiers you own, the more you can store. **Notice that more purifiers doesn't mean faster production, it just means you can hold more water** before you need to loot your containers.
---
* **Healing salves** function the same way like stimpacks and they're relatively easy to acquired. All you need to craft them is a chem station, bloodleaves and soot flowers (1 of each). Bloodleaves you can find along the stream that runs south of Valut 76, through Flatwoods and then forks off east and west. Just follow the stream and you'll find plenty. Soot flowers can be found all around the forest area (west part of the map), as well as south of Vault 76. Getting the greenthumb perks helps a ton.
---
* **Items you should be stocking up on** should be stimpacks, ammo of your preference, apparel (optional, I keep various amounts of apparel for the daily and weekly challenges so it saves me time of looking for them), and rare junk. The rarest and most useful type of junk you can come by is **ballistic fiber, molded plastic, oil, screws, adhesive and nuclear material.** Those are the ones I can think of the top of my head.
---
Have fun wastelander.
---
Sorry mate, can’t. I’m on XB1
---
Pretty sure it disappears after a short time, like just a few minutes. He could also just start a new character.
---
Of course :D
---
You could do this with the Fasnacht mask from the asylum before this patch. 
---
If I were the devs I’d build in an auto kick and temp ban for the rest of the event for anyone that tries to launch a nuke targeting the parade.
---
*lol* thanks :D
---
So am I.
---
But on the post it says PC
---
It just triggers at random. Seems to pop up every 30-45 minutes for me on the servers I'm on.
---
yah see and thos same people said that a dev stated you should try killing certain robots to get certain masks. so maybe with the drop of 100% chance at a mask you get that click of a chance at a rare one?
---
All good! Id love to see what they did with their space if you have the pics? Always good for inspiration 
---
More than a few minutes.
---
Maybe he doesn't want to be forced to interact with people to do simple tasks, in a series based on solo survival.
---
They just dgaf unfortunately.
---
Try to login? 
---
In your haste for free shiny things, you made a critical error.
---
I have blueprints for the Gorge JY, Charleston JY, and Poseidon. Claim the workshop and set down my blueprint which only consists of a foundation/stairs/floors layout with turrets and Power pylons. Place that down and add power, connect a few lines, and in 5 minutes Ive got a fully defended, resource producing workshop and im off to the next one. in under 20 mins I can have 3-4 workshops claimed and fully functional/defended. 
---
Correct. If all the robots survive everyone is guaranteed a mask and a secondary reward like a plan or a recipe or a beret. If a couple die then you've got an 85% chance to receive a mask and a secondary reward. If most of the robots die then your chance at a mask is 50/50. 
---
So when you let the robots die you risk not receiving a reward at all. What you're not doing is changing the RNG of the loot table except by making it worse by adding in another variable that makes rare masks even less likely to be acquired.
---
Well I'm on xbox dont matter anyway.
---
 hate to argue with you, but 33 vs 15 doesn't mean you could easily kill him. Level scaling plus the fact that that only puts you a few armor levels higher for a handful more resistance means he could drop a psychobuff or other relevant chem to level the playing field real quick.
---
*lol* I love to build- happy to support a recovering shine addict and build you something if you ever want.
---
Thank you! :D
---
if i could slow clap any harder i wouldnt be moving my hands, your so clever. gold star for you
---
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! 
---
Cant find the datamine now. Which is strange because I remeber reading it this morning. Maybe it was removed.
---
You were the first to comment. Are you on PC? If yes you get everything.
---
But then they won't be rare anymore.
---
I only took 1 unfortunately (for that loading screen memento hah), I'll upload it once I get off work.
---
That was weird... 
---
Pshh 
---
i dont think it was? i was just reading it to see if there was more info added yet before i asked on my own
---
Yeah game creshed. Sorry 
---
Saammeee.. HAPPY CAMPER!!
---
Then go play a solo-player game?
---
Just because a multi-player game CAN be played solo doesn't mean it is designed to be.
---
Considering this is your fifth character you’re power levelling, I would expect you to know all of the best options.  You really just relied on Whitesprings before?
---
LOL
---
Word.
---
Thanks for this. This is the most helpful post I got in this sub 
---
There's a few cars along the path the robots walk. You could potentially kill one of them by shooting at the cars as the bots are passing by.
---
I recently built my cabin near the tattoo parlor for the alcohol brewing quest with a nice little farm filled with corn, razor grain and blackberries hoping it will help someone brew some booze!
---
I haven’t personally seen anyone use it but I can always hope someone is happy to stumble across it.
---
You can also server hop to participate faster
---
It's only level 30 so the sloth's loot isn't really going to be all that great. Still nice to have for vendor fodder, but if you're 50+ it's going to be lackluster.
---
Probably a dumb question, but it couldn't have been one of the parade robots, right?
---
Had same issue last night.   I did find a mask in my inventory a few minutes later.   I assumed server lag - the entire server showed up for that event. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's designed to be played however you want it to be played. You should be able to lonewolf everything, it's a survival game first.
---
The quest is a cakewalk, i've never seen more than one bot die. If the the kind of mask drops are tied to the number of bots left (which has been stated), then the obvious question is.. maybe we should let all (or at least most) the robots die. Come together and witness a massacre. 
---
West-tek is my go-to place now.  I keep my C.A.M.P.  on one of the nearby lead deposits.   I’ve also noticed that no robots attack me at Watoga since I’ve completed the Mayor For A Day quest.  Even after killing other robots, they still don’t attack me, so it’s easy to kill a few spawns while I’m in the area to sell at the station vendor. Good luck!
---
Is your armorer perk high enough? Some of the modifications require higher grade of knowledge to produce parts.
---
That area has some interesting spots.. building with a team in mind vs playing solo is always interesting.
---
I’m first one to comment. Yet I’m not getting anything because the game doesn’t have cross platform. 
---
Dammit wish you were on a PlayStation
---
Did you entire post? Events scale with number of people in the event area. The most extreme case is scorched Earth, where even one or two leeches can make the queen impossible to kill within the time limit, but it happens with other events too. Most of the time, there are only a few people at any given event, and most of the time all or most are participating, so it's not that noticable. This is the first one (besides scorched Earth) that tends to draw huge crowds, and if a lot of those people are afk, the event can fail. As illustrated by OP.
---
So what does someone lose with you being there afk? Potentially, they fail the event that they were sitting there waiting for it to start for 30-40 minutes.
---
Kramer...? 
---
They were in power armor, I'll be better about screen caps tonight as I plan to hop the entire night
---
I'll take it.  IGN= WhiteNoiseMaker
---
Oh nice! How are you going with the area being nuked more often? 
---
Im on pc, can use some extra stuff on my second account
---
Awesome thanks :D
---
I had to reboot the game/PS4 itself. Once I did the main menu info screen thing changed to be about the parade, and I got in on the next world.
---
Winner! Adding you right now, come to whitesprings i cant move lol.
---
Ok sweet 
---
I've done the event over 30 times now, i have not seen a single player equip or run around with any of the uncommon ones. I've seen Beret but they are not part of the mask list it is part of the plan/recipe list.
---
The flies state only one difference I can see which is an "Unknown" value for the mask list that is 50 in the low rewards, 15 in the medium, and 0 in the high. How does this tie in with the roll between 0 and 1 [https://www.reddit.com/u/Waffle\_cop](https://www.reddit.com/user/Waffle_cop)?
---
E01F\_Fasnacht\_LL\_Quest\_Rewards\_Low  
---
E01F\_Fasnacht\_LL\_Quest\_Rewards\_Medium  
---
E01F\_Fasnacht\_LL\_Quest\_Rewards\_High
---
So if this ties anyway into letting robots getting killed, that is just because they butchered the loot table calc and gave bad direction up until they livestream a video.
---
I love it.
---
Probably true. There's this tweet where Bethesda said to watch for further updates when referring to the moon mask
---
https://twitter.com/Ulysses_Jack16/status/1108306897961021440?s=19
---
Please bring this back to vendors while you are at it.
---
They're not at 25% for me. Just got an 85% and a 98%. Probably my highest in a while. 
---
I don’t understand the statement. Could you clarify for the uninformed?
---
Yeah, that makes sense. That way they can spread out the event longer instead of people grinding for all masks on the first day.
---
I now kno how often the parade begins I hope to get more masks tonight
---
I liked some of their under armour too, but because you can't put ballistic weave on it I never wear it.
---
That is soooo cool. Reminds of the car shows I go to. Awesome!!!
---
Which mask are considered rare?
---
Aye man! Let me know what you get! :) I'm on Xbox but I'm just curious on what you end up getting.
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky?  Seems unlikely though tbh. 25 out of 25 (can't find a damn t-60 right arm) have been at 25%.
---
Every damn time someone gets a run of bad luck they cry about stealth nerfs. 
---
If they all die, the event fails. Someone nuked the area last night, so I figured I'd see if the event will still trigger. It did, but there was only one other high level player in the area, and we couldn't take out the level 60+ suiciders fast enough to keep them from demolishing the robots.
---
I'm thinking it's a combination. They've clearly said that the kind of loot changes with robot survival. The quest is a cake walk. We aren't seeing the rare drops because we aren't getting into the rare drop scenario of watching the majority those majestic machines murdered by mutants. even if the over all drop rate goes down, it might be the only way to get rare drops at all. 
---
I've done that a few times now. Not good. 
---
No nuking happening there that I have seen. I haven’t build near Helvetia if that’s what you are thinking, I’ve heard a few people have been nukes there during the Fasnacht event 
---
 hey i got an idea.  How about you piss off?
---
Just make random ammo. I run a mile build and it saves alot of space. Makes you XP, and one day you can sell it or just give it away to other players.
---
You were never able to inspect another players weapon in trading 
---
Got my Toothy Man mask and I don't know if any of the other masks matter anymore. 
---
I'm betting those people are probably running it for the first time and simply don't have one yet.
---
whitespring was nerfed hard..it doesnt allow the deathclaw/radscorpion or yoa guai to respawn either..i guess just do one full round and then head off to your next favorite area
---
There are plenty of higher level players who will help you out and not screw you over. Don't play with that guy. People like that can destroy your experience on fo76. If you need a hand with a mission try messaging some people on your server and see what happens. I personally have no problem helping out lower level players. 
---
Didn't they mention you can bring over your character to survival mode?
---
I did it all robots alive no mask at the end 
---
I just read it. Forgot to copy the link. More robots = better chance for mask to drop. Still, almost no chance for a rare due to coding error. Miniscule. So keep those robots alive, people! And hope for an hotfix. 
---
I made a post about one of the rare mask https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3j0n4/rare_mask_helvetia/?
---
I’ll take both just in case, I’ve got 50 cork you can have. Probably won’t be on for about an hour 
---
Thank you, I love the kitchen in your CAMP, it looks sweet
---
Camden park is broken 
---
thats the monster mash mask not from the event
---
You can get that one from glitching out the monster mash event I think...
---
That area has lots of cobalt flux and the low level scorched are easy to farm stable flux ingredients from. I've seen it nuked before the parade event was going. While many of the people doing it may be nuking it simply to be a dick a lot of people were just wondering if it would change anything.
---
Also nuking it isn't griefing. Being a dick and griefing are not the same. People keep throwing around the word griefing when it pertains to anything they don't like other people doing way to often. Harassing and killing someone repeatedly for no other reason to be an asshole is griefing. A lot of people exploit workshops and events to kill people for easy caps which suck but bethesda programmed it that way.
---
--close
---
There is a reason for that.......
---
The 0 and 1 roll that i am talking about are in the mask list tied to the mask itself. If you go inside the low/medium/high they all reference the same two lists(mask,secondary). Once inside the mask list, the 5 masks(skull,jester,winter = uncommon;sun,goblin=rare) have an additional if statement that checks a random roll. Should be listed under conditions in the loot list for that item.
---
People are definitely throwing that term around way too much now.
---
I do generally run a firewall and AV--I've only turned it all off to troubleshoot this game.  I like to be scientific about these things, and have as much of the check boxes ticked before I get to the point of asking for help from CS, so that we can all not waste each other's time.  *That* is how one is considerate--by respecting each other's time.
---
They misidentified my CPU specs (nbd).  When corrected, they moved the goalpost to my GPU being too weak (also missing the boat).  They were on the customer blame game, not the customer service path.  There's no legit reason to conflate customer service with abuse.  Customer service gets my utmost respect and politeness.  Abuse doesn't.  It's never right to tell folks they needed to suffer more abuse to get their needs met.
---
FYI, the Beth forums have multiple folks talking about losing chat when they're promoted to team leader.  Wouldn't you admit that sounds like a server side issue?  And wouldn't you admit that the game pointing to an IP that isn't public facing is not an issue with my computer?
---
Considering everything worked, and nothing changed on my end (except maybe the latest patch! Hmmmmmm?!), and then suddenly it didn't work, I don't agree with your assessment at all.
---
It's all rng man
---
It takes place in Helvetia every hour or so. First you have to find the 5 parade marching bots and do some minor fetching for them (collecting wood, honey, eggs, etc), and then you follow them around town fighting off occasional waves of mobs. There's a level 35 legendary at the end, so if you're still at or below that level it's worth doing jsut for the chance to get a decent piece of kit.
---
Yeah, but they also said they could be wrong. I'm thinking it's right and either it's a bug or they are time gated.
---
Just 3 hrs ago.  Ran it, and got nuked 1/2 way through. All the robots died, and it just ended.
---
It would be cool if they included some hints as to how to achieve this in a holotape or terminal.. just seems like a puzzle that’s missing pieces and Bethesda’s just telling us to figure it out. Especially as others have stated, they had to have known it would be hard to communicate an effective strategy to a whole server of people on how many robots to let die. 
---
Just got the beret
---
I hate that pacifist stops you from retaliation entirely, meaning once griefers attack there no easy way to defend yourself. If you attack a pacifist player, you should get 2x the bounty.
---
Exactly, 10 item minimum starting out at least.
---
u can get that icon (but with blonde hair) for free from the atom store just an FYI
---
yeah man it was a cake walk lol i mean i did other things here and there but nothing really compares
---
Hopefully someone hits you up but if you still need help I’m an hour I’ll message you 
---
Problem is - there are challenges in this game that can only be earned via playing with the others. And I don't mean just the daily/weekly ones.
---
Once the vaults open up the stress on grouping up will practically force the loners to comply.
---
Haha, I love taking photos of bugs in the game,  I will have to try this out tonight!
---
I heard its on a timer now (about 15min) But i havent tested it to confirm or anything like that. its just what i heard. pass it along lol
---
Man, if he doesn't, I'd take it. Just spent like 3 hours trying to get some to spawn.
---
Think about what’s your time like gonna be next week with no parade 
---
thats ok i can leave it with my mate - **alphafoxwolf** if im not on
---
Did this event when a nuke had already dropped. The animals you need intestines for didn't spawn, so the timer ran out. :/
---
Every one I pulled from PA since the patch have been 25%. And only a couple from the fusion generators have been 100%. It's obvious they have nerfed power cores.  Now I spend a quarter of my time getting cores. The grind in this game is on the verge of ruining it.
---
Happy to be of assistance! 
---
&gt; I got my previous character to lvl 50 in 3-4 days before just farming the white springs properly
---
WOW
---
The excavator skin was designed from the beginning. Look at the poster near garrahan. They all have that skin on them. 
---
I'm guilty of taking the coffee pots...not even sure why. I just always grab them without thought when I see them. 
---
I just watched the full stream and the Devs never said anything about drop changing depending on the number of surviving bots. They do say that it is of our best interest to protect all of the robots to don't lose the chance to win a mask.
---
Clip of the dev saying that:

Wow I actually like the carpet floor once it’s laid out. Wasn’t really feeling it in the shop. 
---
Got screwed on a deal trading for a 3* legendary item Cruz I couldn't see its other effects. I got sold a different piece with much lower quality secondary effects. Waste of 3k
---
So which part of my reply do you not understand?
---
Let me know if it works for you 
---
Yep the others this In this post may not believe you but I do. I have not found a core with more 25 percent from random frames since the patch last week. This is not a string of bad luck at this point. This is fact. 
---
ive definitely been there more than 15 mins..and i seen newer players come there and even they did not trigger any new ghouls or glowing ones..this along with flux being devalued has made WS pretty meh
---
If you have gold or premium or whatever and someone mentions your username you get notified
---
I mean any of the power armor skins can be used and making a skin texture is not that hard ( do it all the time ). It's a quick easy profit for them honestly and the way they designed it is to maximize profit. 
---
He's not fucking wrong
---
Dont know why you get down voted for complaining.Idiots here.Cant even get the cool masks advertised for the event.
---
True 
---
Ah so, I misunderstood. Carry on then.
---
Unfortunately not, I'm on ps4 
---
ganna be interesting, still plenty of time till the week ends tho
---
Ohh well, anyways if the int 50 and 15 means anything to the calc in a linear fashion i belive i should have atleast seen some uncommon masks by now... Weird how they seem to have fucked this up.
---
I can't get people to not kill. In fact by trying to trap robots to make them die I am being called a griefer... 
---
It's definitely not like that. I've had all 5 survive several times and I've gotten Giant, Owl, and Soldier. 
---
If its luck then we both are on the same team. I've noticed the same shit in the last twenty or so PA suits. I didn't even bother grabbing them.
---
Thanks for advice man, I will consider that
---
Ill try some new things today and post it to spread the knowledge. I tried making them respawn last weekend in a number of way (leaving team before leaving server, going to another area before jumping, killing a ghoul from a different area before re entering server, even killing my team mate before coming back) You know, cause you never know. And idk why or how but for a few times it worked. but i cant confirm if it was just coincidence or if it actually worked (or what worked lol) 
---
Are the brewing quests only available for a limited time? My level 13 is stuck on one where I need crimson flux to craft it. I did just find a hazmat suit the other night so I am on the lookout for nukes sites now. Might be awhile before that toon can complete it though.
---
Riddle me this, why would a sophisticated Englishman want to play a video game set in hick town West Virginia! In America we call this stupid! 
---
They can
---
If they destroy them, just scrap the plant
---
Gives you back the materials to craft it again without needing fertiliser
---
So stupid...
---
That’s why I love this series
---
No kidding, wish I knew that sooner lol
---
o it must be that there is literally nothing constructive about it and your opinion like you i would assume are as useful as a condom with a hole in it. everyone is aware its random, people are trying to figure out what might help and and what triggers will help, plenty of time till the week is over tho
---
Lots of them are PA users, Mr. Fuzzy Masks and Molerat Masks
---
This is all a hidden raider quest... ;)
---
very true
---
I love fallout 76 love playing but there's no communication from Bethesda. Agreed on idiots
---
The ones the OP is referring to:  the rarer ones.
---
I will be online again in a bit to trade :)
---

---
These camps all look dope! 
---
Drop by mine sometime, the Tipsy Ferry: https://m.imgur.com/a/MCWU4Oh
---
I don't believe so, thankfully.
---
there are five rare ones you can see in another post, and people are trying to figure out if there are some triggers thatll help encourage there drop
---
Workshops do not stop producing the material benefits you get from them whether you are sitting on location or not. The luxury of perpetual resource collection and additional fast travel options comes at the cost of ongoing defense obligations. 
---
Whether the motivation of a contesting player is to utilize the workshop for themselves, or kill you repeatedly until you forfeit ownership is irrelevant.
---
There are few things that workshops provide that you cannot acquire otherwise in-game through purely PvE interactions. Certain plans being easier to acquire is the reward for engaging with the risk mechanic in question. Perhaps there need to be more alternative methods to acquiring these plans. 
---
You are clearly welcome to ask for things to change because you'd like to benefit from the workshop mechanics while minimizing the risk of ownership. But if there is no risk to your junk, your caps or your progress, then why reward claiming/retention of a workshop at all? 
---
Lmfaooooooooooo!!! I LOVE fo4! I've spent many hours playing and building. 
---
No way that’s sweet
---
In general I watch about 10 of all bullets miss their mark too. Countless times I've shot an enemy at point blank and watch the health bar not so much as waver. 
---
Who said I was sophisticated? In England we would call this a "stereotype". 
---
I have nothing to add except:
---
*Brilliant* OP &amp; follow-up, Waffle\_cop. Many thanks for your community spirit! +karma
---
No e-mail and yes what a buch of do good assholes. Bet they have tottaly clean accounts and have never done an expolit like log on and off with a friebd to spawn ghuals at Whitesprings. What that isn't an expolit oh yes it fucking is an exploit! Farming crybabies... waa I suck at video games the dupers are why I suck... 
---
I was skeptical too! The texture looks weird up close but at a distance it works. 
---
i have had that happen and so has a buddy
---
*lol* what a waste! People are odd xD
---
yeah it seems whitespring is donezo...and i basically lived there (lol)..i now resort to harpers/tanagra town or even outside of watoga where there are a ton of high-level enemies..since flux was nerfed..i needed to improvise and figure out more lucrative ways to obtain caps
---
Folks tag the Bethesda community managers in comments like these as typically the accounts are notified when their username is mentioned like that.
---
As a limiting mechanism, the reddit admins made it so it will do that for up to 3 usernames.  If you have 4 or more usernames mentioned in a comment, none of them will get a notification.
---
this is basically perfect
---
Instead of rushing to the sloth, focus on crowd control.  Your shiny loot is just a d10000 roll away.

Thank you!! 
---
Man, that secret Mothman chapel...it's really cool
---
whynotboth.gif  
---
Seriously though, I've been trading with other people, too, which is the only way I've gotten through some of them, but having to do that every day to get through a challenge because I wasn't lucky with the recipe drop sucks.
---
When everyone's SPECIAL, no one is.
---
I wonder if they tied it to your luck perk in the last update. I've had other buddies complain too, but they ride with low luck. I looted just to compare. I hardly ever loot them though, I usually just take a workshop. 
---
Its still a work in progress. but if you have any not on the list let me know.
---
Nope they only spawn when the event heart of the swamp is active OR when you have someone with the quest active on your server. You possibly toke someone else's that they needed for the quest. But yes you can just server hop and Will find some when someone on the server has the quest to get the bloom active. 
---
Fasnacht also highlight something Fallout 76 can do that almost nothing else does: variable quests. Every time you do the quest there's little differences that make it refreshing and keep it interesting. It's not enough to completely change the event but makes it far more interesting. So few other games do this.
---
For all its faults the Fasnacht quest shows extreme promise for the game if future events are able to keep up this level of quality.
---
Can you start marking these with spoiler tags?
---
Creatures HATE crops. Build yourself some fences or barricades. Or maybe some turrets. 
---
The "scrap" option used on a busted plant gives you back the food and fertilizer that you use to plant it. So you can scrap and replant your crops if you can't repair them. 
---
no, go away
---
Sorry to offend mate, I used them as an example for the “I did my research, you didn’t” argument. It’s not a strong argument, it is weak and often more insulting than anything.  If he came in and politely debunked the op with evidence (the one old man winter mask we know of).  
---
I've found them out by Valley Galleria when nothing was going on, so I agree they just happen. I bet it's more often/easier to find them when the mire is verdant. 
---
I always bounce between whitespring.. Black water mine.. And walk to the fissure near white spring and head back to white springs and get lucky enough to see new ghouls respawn and always run into three rad scorpions
---
Thank you! Praise be the MOTH
---
Shouldve taken a screenshot, after over 30+ parades, highest i've still seen was still the Megasloth which was around 40, everything was below level 20
---
The donut is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in the game yet. It takes like 7 different ingredients and doesn't do anything other than heal for 25hp, which is less than you'd get by simply eating the raw ingredients.
---
Level 45 Two shot 10mm pistol, for 300 caps correct? 
---
I've watched a pack of anglers ignore a junk collector water purifier and a handful of turrets to smash my crops. Seems to be a priority target
---
I wish I could find a high lvl parade 
---
I doubt it. Bethesda "confirmed" that all masks are presently obtainable
---
Same for me. Not a huge problem since I held a power plant yard for a few hours to make fusion cores. Did that a few weeks ago and I’m still holding on, but random cores I find keep winding up at 25% or less.
---
Are the prep requirements the same each time? Ive seen 7 dif ones: play music, kill honeybeasts, gather wood, wax, steins, eggs, intestines. But i dont see all of the each time. (Maybe someone else just finishes it 1st)
---
But if the preps change, and therefore the marchers; that might affect the rewards.
---
The thing is, the concept for workshops is different than a camp (or settlements in FO4). They are intended to be something that stays behind after you logout, for the next person to either use as you’ve built it or scrap it. Further it’s made to be taken over in PVP. Being able to deploy a specific setup is counterintuitive to both those concepts, unless the first step of doing so would be to scrap anything that has previously been built at that workshop on that server. 
---
Here, have another one
---
Someone probably nuked it earlier.  Even after the nuke zone goes away high levels still spawn for a while. 
---
I think this happens when someone nukes the area, the nuke zone goes away for the event but the spawn levels stay.  
---
Add me: Mammouthu
---
Its a multi-player game first. even the lore is you, and everyone else in the vault, are rebuilding, not that you are the last survivor of vault 76.
---
Maybe it's just getting through with one then? Like a bloody build, rewarding you for cutting it close. 
---
Sure, I’ll take it. PS4 username is the same as this one.
---
The excavator just has ridiculous durability compared to the others, which seems like a fair trade off for not having as much DR/ER/rad resist.  I built a set of level 45 as soon as I was able to, and I don't think I've had to repair it in the 80 levels I've gained since then.
---
I had a run without a single dead robot and yet I also did not get a mask
---
If you don’t get the plans are you SOL until next year?
---
PC here, I will come to you right now. Add cactuspixel
---
Will do
---
On the one hand, it's frustrating for people who wanted to do the event.
---
On the other, this gave me a chance to actually mess around in a nuke zone that wasn't Whitesprings. And then I switched servers &amp; did the event normally. (Pity I wasn't able to stabilize any of the flux, not enough drops.)
---
That is the trade off of playing the game solo. it is more difficult, because it is not made to be a single player game.
---
It’s been around for a while now 
---
i let all the people with tse handle the sloth, i melee so i cant run over there fast enough so i do the wolves and such. im hoping when the popularity dies down abit things can be tried like letting certain bots die and such
---
I call shenanigans on 'kills me in one hit'. Even so, the first time he didn't steal 'a bunch of my caps', he got 33. 'Everytime I go to get my stuff back...' why would you do this??? And Pacifist does not mean Invincible.  Next time block player and/or leave the server.  
---
Which platform are you on? If you're on PC I'll get one to you :)
---
That just happened on my server a couple minutes ago. It was a dozen level 20-60 somethings battling it out. For some reason they didn't attack me so I just sat on a roof top watching and giving them thumbs up emotes every time someone died.
---
Lost a really nice black cowboy hat when SO started chatting to me while I was doing a scrap - my own silly fault but if we can have an item as a fav, could it be locked that way?  BTW Anyone know where I could find another hat? The fedora isn’t quite the same....
---
It was definitely a nuke zone or right after a nuke zone. Same thing happened with me
---
It's worth a shot, but you'd need a coordinated group to take over server, otherwise randos will kill the mutants before they can reach the bots.
---
Me too, but I suck at building
---
The cliffs around Tyler county fairgrounds there is a mad hatter tea party setup. Usually spawns two. Or you can add me and I can give you one.

Yup, I had this encounter really early on in the game. It's a rare encounter. Congrats.
---
Thank you.

There's 2 responder bots that spawn. 1 that talks and 1 that trades. 
---
How many hours in are you? I played for probably 20 hours before it even occurred to me to try it. Like you said, so many unnecessary load screens.
---
That’s what I’m looking at and it just says the coming weeks 
---
There’s a responder bot, and the vendor responder bot. 
---
The vendor one will have a Brahman with him. 
---
Yeah 
---
Especially, ESPECIALLY the &gt;!3-star legendary at the end of the Fasnacht event.!&lt;

Probably april 9th or 16th. decorated is listed among player vending (the 9th) and the new camera (the 16th) but isn't given a date in the pictures.

That's what I thought also. When I looked in my inventory, there was nothing showing at all, in any list, apparel, aid,junk,notes,misc. I've bought plans and mods for weapons before but this is the first time for power armor
---
Thanks again for your help
---
The amount of enemies depends on how many people are participating. When I did it with 10, there was so many, made the Mutants a bit of a problem. 
---
When I ran it with just 4, way less, and less challenging. 
---
I'll be more than happy to help build your home, if we play on the same device lol

That sounds sweet, bring on the level 90 super mutants

Ok i will but it'll take forever to walk everywhere when you're overencumbered.

I hate having broken weapons or running out of ammo

None of these are really QOL. People are using that term wrong.

I server hopped for the X-01 jet pack mod 2-3 patches ago. 15-20 times and I found it. I've never found the calibrated shocks and I'm level 93. The T-60 I got are from the Harper's Ferry vendor. I hopped less than 10 times once I found the first pair to get the other pair. It has changed my game.
---
Omg I want to try again so bad now, this was a very long time ago, around beta time so maybe? 
---
In or out of PA. I think I was always inside 
---
Not sure if anyone told you or if you read through the thread yet, but inventory mods on the PC use the file name, not the item name. You are seeing the original name for the item instead of the intended one.
---
Ah hopefully that’s what happened with me then. Thanks!
---
You got a 50cal sniper rifle? Was it legendary?
---
...sounds like you might be the asshole
---
They said you can import existing characters with everything they have but they are also calling it Survival Beta. Meaning they are going to change things however they want. When it launches it will immediately start getting player feedback and when the masses complain then changes will be made. We all know how that goes.  
---
The image with it has the dates
---
also im ganna call my bad on being so rude, im not normally so. but a teething son has me sleep deprived and alittle on edge
---
Here's a few tips:
---
1) For one of your level ups, i recommend you take the perk Good Doggy (in endurance). As a result, you'll want to pick up canned dog food whenever you see it. This perk makes it so that dog food will fill your hunger bar by about 1/3, in addition, it will also heal you for roughly the same amount as a diluted stimpak.
---
2) If you've learned how to dilute stimpaks/radaway/rad-x, I highly recommend diluting any radaway and rad-x you can. They aren't more powerful in this form, however, they will last a bit longer. In addition, diluted rad-x doesn't suppress any mutations if you have them.
---
3) An alternative to taking the good doggy perk: If you have or take the green thumb perk (in perception), then I'd recommend growing some food at your camp. Whenever any of it is ready to harvest, equip the green thumb perk and you get two crops from one harvest. Cooking razorgrain or corn is a great way to have food that replenishes food + water in addition to some health without having to use stimpaks.
---
Probably included with vending
---
Haha I know. And the overseers mission is still there. Lol 
---
I was thinking that they would drop the rare masked later this week and word would spread. People will start to lose interest after two days or so, but if word gets pit that they are getting those rare masks, people will start grinding for them again.
---
This game defiantly has an identity crisis on whether it is a multiplayer game that you can play solo, or a solo game that you can play on a team. The problem is with the franchise being solo up to this point, if they made it a full on mmo based around teamwork they would isolate a large chunk of the player base. They need to decide for it to reach its fullest potential, no half ass bullshit. 
---
TL;DR I agree with you that this should be more focused on multiplayer/teamwork then solo. The whole premise and tag line for the game is “rebuild together”. 
---
Awww man that's a bummer! I'm on ps4, I do have an Xbox buuuuut I don't fo76 for it 😣
---
He also doesnt seem to get why people reacted adversely to a comment about an easily negated mechanic while he insulted people before they even commented lmao
---
with one confirmed mask out of the subreddit i'd say they're right, and unless they've got a second event planned then i'd say it's a bug
---
I compiled what I've collected so far in a google spreadsheet.
