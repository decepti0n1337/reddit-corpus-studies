Ha.

Actually, my comment was to serve as a reminder to myself, as I hadn't yet done the event. I had recently placed an A.A.FFR gatling laser in my vendor, and wanted to take it out, before I actually started playing. For some reason, I was convinced that a.a. weapons weren't all that useful; between 3 toons, all I have left is that, and a couple of Final Words.

---
---
That’s the [Mountain Scout Uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mountain_scout_uniform)
---
Then everybody has different timets and people would just delay looting the boss for ages. Its not that hard to just casually loot while fighting and even with minimal looting I came out with a huge amount of screws and acid.
---
I agree
---
This picture alone was worth the effort. Nicely done.
---
You get 3* from finishing the quest aside from the 2* from doing the Queen, but you don’t get repair kits.
---
There is a mod on FO4 for danse to be buz lightyear
---
( Modder )  
---
It's the same bullshit in the modding community.  
---
We give free mods for years and years and years, over a decade. And everyone knew deep down (or said at least), "Hey, modders deserve to get paid for all the hard work they do"   
---
But the second the Creation Club launches and starts employing modders to make for-profit mods... "Eugh, take it down. It's bullshit. I could get this for free elsewhere. Wahhhh" They want something for nothing, want something to be paid for, just not by them.   
---
Bunch of entitled children if you ask me.
---
I mean for all items to be in the build menu, if people had access to everything then they would be more incentivized to build seeing how it looks first in your world.
---
Right now we have items that are cycled in to create false rarity, when in truth all these items should just be perm. added to the build menu with a quick buy button instead of having to go into the atom shop to purchase., It would increase their sales for sure if they just gave us access to all furniture.
---
Have fun with it, I will try my best to have fun as well, even if right now I'm a tad upset.
---
Perhaps in the future with mods on private worlds. 
---
For now, the Play Time Power Armor and the Nuka-Girl Helmet work pretty well.
---
You need to use a prime receiver against her probably.
---
I enjoyed this event a lot, to the point I'm going to stock up on supplies for it. It was nice to have a boss that doesn't get melted and there's some really cool mechanics - the scare one is timed pretty well, I was worried it would get aggravating, but it's cool that it forces you to pay attention to positioning. 
---
I wish the area was a smidge brighter, or that the haze was reduced. Hard to take cool photos and I almost couldn't find the escape tunnel because it's just so dark. Also hard to loot anything, especially Earle. 
---
I died to the drill on my second time...had no idea it did damage, thought it was for aesthetic!
---
Earle's a bullet sponge, but the receiving ammo drops can help, and honestly I don't suffer for ammo with so many player vendors selling every kind. A mechanic to do damage to Earle or wipe out wendigo spawns would be engaging but not always necessary. Both times I've done it we've had 7-10 people and it still took us nearly the whole event time, and lots of deaths, so it is challenging. Also the monotony of the glowing wendigo spawns and their screams can be a bit irritating. Some poison/fire/ice wendigos would be kinda cool.
---
As other have said, for the Legendary Run. And i do it to each vendor I visit, just in case the player has not finished this daily yet.
---
Wouldn't we need to know the other 2 heads with him? Do we assume the Colossus is just one person or is is 3 Wendigo's melted together.
---
I think that, canonically, it is only happening once. Both with the SBQ and the Colossal Problem. Looking from a lore perspective, no more than exactly two nukes were fired by the Vault 76 dwellers. 
---
Initially, it didn't make sense to me either to just keep on nuking the map with no consequence whatsoever, but then, if you look on your pip boy, it's always 23rd october. It never changes. This implies that we are stuck in a loop, kind of reliving those two nukes launching, for the sake of having something fun to do. 
---
I mean, it's a pretty shit plot full of holes, and the more you try to explain it, the more you can't believe what you're saying because it gets so stupid.
---
"It just works"
---
Most things that are going to be enabled in try atom shop are available to purchase prior to showing. I think. Sometimes the blueprint takes you to a bundle  that's all I can really say. I get what you mean and it would get more. But Bethesda is stubborn
---
You can still get the end chest
---
You can? It spawns me outside and the mine is completely closed off every time I die
---
  / who thF need a troublshooters knife ?
---
A melee player.
---
I’m having these issues on console. They’ve just started recently too.
---
If you have private world you can put items in a suitcase or something else and transfer them between characters or do it on another person's world. As long as they dont leave it will work.
---
Thank you for the kind words! I'm definitely excited to actually finish it with a group.
---
just be patient.  Once you get around level 60 you will be swimming in ammo.
---
Unless you are doing SBQ in private server, don't do it. Or only do it when they are on the second half hp bar where most everyone in the SBQ fight already done enough damage, or you are going to earn a lot of angry face emotes
---
criminal masterminds right here &lt;3
---
I just did the same, i helped a level 57 player. Gave him an upgraded gat plasma, gattling gun and full Ultracite set. Loads of aid and ammo. Oh and some apperel
---
It's fine, out of the 5 times I've done it, it's worked everytime. I'm pretty sure you people are going to have slowdown at the escape part &amp; the end looting is annoying for everyone.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Overall  just join fast so you are in the 1st instance and don't die
---
SIXTEEN TIMES the details
---
Just give me your caps and Ill call you a loser, same feeling as gambling!
---
[removed]
---
Finding my private servers pretty stale lately as well
---
They are rare but hardly worth much at this time. I just traded my OG urban scout mask that I’ve had since the first month of release for Rad barrel and bear arm plan. You’d be lucky to get 15k caps for one
---
I spawn inside the mine.
---
If I see this happen to me, I'm just going to stop shooting the boss and take out the adds.
---
I said they need to remove the limitations. I said even with them gone the amount of content is still the exact same. Where are you losing me exactly? Pointnit out and ill explain. Otherwise this is going nowhere, unless that's the goal. 
---
And I asked, explain where I dont understand the world. You've yet to do that.
---
And saying they're lazy isn't even an opinion. We've seen how hard they dropped the ball with this game since the beginning. Take building. Literally a copy and paste job from FO4. And they hardly did any changes with it, it infact feels worse. Then promises about FO1st they have yet to make good on.
---
No, I was going for consistent comparable DPS. I can hit the head from most angles, not so much with the belly.
---
You think games get better with \*less funding\*?  
---
What planet do you live on, dude?
---
Huh I’ve never had that happen to me when the boss has been killed already and it’s happened around 5 times today
---
She said 'With all those horrible nukes flying around' - it's all because you spam SBQ so much that Appalachians got used to it. I too hope the game's agenda will get more anti-nuke in future. Like at the end of server lives, let us seal the missile sites in one grand farewell event.
---
Sadly theres not alot you can do only tip I can give is make sure your camp module has plenty of space around it for the pet ...other then that not much u can do to prevent it
---
I mean there’s no downsides to the mutation so it shouldn’t be overpowered.
---
Got my hands on a b/e Gatling plasma and taking out the clump of wendigos that spawns (in a private session) is so satisfying.
---
ZeniMax has Vulture Capitalist investors/shareholders
---
Magic all the way baby
---
For harambe!
---
Make the excavator power armor bro if you havent.  Extra carry weight.  You will get ultracite for free laters in main quest.
---
I think the best part is that screws are easy to get now. I went from 40-340 screws in an hour and screws are the things I use the most. I cam get loads of aluminium, copper and screws.
---
That was not my experience. It may be that way in they events. I've seen talk about it specifically with "Colossal Problem." My experience wandering around the PTS wasteland did not reflect mobs dropping any more ammo than they previously did.
---
Excellent. Thank you for the info. I'll return there soon and check it out
---
Some stimpak and nuka cola on hotkey is good for your health. Haven't die once in 8 successful run yet.
---
Outfit is my guess. Since it is basically a more detailed version of the BoS fatigues, and that set was accidentally made into an outfit item, I’m imagining they “built” steel dawn fatigues from the base BoS fatigues and just forgot to flag the original back to under armor.
---
Sadly it's a F2P MMO design structure without the free part.
---
I never had a big issue with bugs, and I knew the game design wasn't for everyone but that was fine, there was fun to be had. In many ways this game is like FO4 if you're looking for a neat open world to roam in. But Bethesda's relentless attempts to monetize the crap out of this game have truly put it into a bad place almost two years after launch. They've continued the same slow, problem-riddled development outcomes, while simultaneously making me feel like little more than a wallet to them. 
---
Essentially, they keep moving the pieces without much improving the gameplay goals of the product, the quality of the product, or the availability of the product (unless you have money to burn).
---
Precisely. Im happy and thankful for the stuff we get in terms of free items. And if something is payed, i choose what i want to pay for. Its how the world works. Free atoms are less often now, but theres still free atoms. Be happy about that, instead of angry all the time, yknow what i mean? Atleast thats how I look at it
---
I still use a suppressed 10mm in low level areas and I’m lvl 160
---
The server would explode trying to load in all of those assets.
---
Happens sometimes but mostly on PC anyway everyone just gets stuck in and has fun. Again this is changing something because of a minority, this is something I do no agree with.
---
round down to the nearest whole number?
---
Lol this sub man, I swear. Gonna flame a dude and call him out by his username for picking up a useless one star pistol that you dropped on the ground. Virtue signaling as if you did an amazing deed by dropping this guy a useless weapon. I guess the fact that this game takes place in a nuclear wasteland riddled with raiders just goes right over everyones head. I don’t remember the agreement I had to sign when I bought the game saying that I had to play nice and be friendly to everyone.
---
Y’all are actually pathetic, this game was broken on launch. It shout have launched that way. Being anti consumer because they are incompetent at releasing a working product in not beyond me cause y’all will eat it up. Broken perks? Hundreds of bugs, constant crashing? 
---
Keep putting words in my mouth arguing on this sub is like talking to a wall.
---
I think it’s related to the new event. Every time it starts i get crazy lag. Iv also had a lot of spawning in without my power armor on. Then when i enter a new area it’s on me.

These are the three errors when it happens.
---
do the quest reward PLANS also count as a bullion reward? can you trade the quest reward plans?
---
Same.
---
Speaking of which: Anybody know where the location of the dead Power Armor soldier is located? I assumed near Huntersville but there isn't a military base nearby. So I'm going to assume near Camp McClintock?
---
This never appears in game does it?
---
If you have the plan learned, then yes.
---
Do you remember Thunderhead?
---
I wish the devs had made a separate map that was completely destroyed like buildings are half razed and such and when an area was nuked the destroyed map would take over the nuke area. Of course, this would have had to be done before the game came out as it would take to long to create now.
---
Ok thanks
---
Plenty of single player games have big open worlds. Nothing about that suggests 'MMO'.
---
What suggests MMO?
---
1. **Persistent servers**
---
2. **A lot of people on those servers**
---
3. Typically some kind of more demanding, more dynamic and persistently updated gameplay feature, frequently represented through the concept of 'endgame'
---
Fallout 76 does not have persistent servers; it does not have a lot of people on those servers, nowhere near what any other MMO has; and it does not have anything in terms of persistent gameplay features like endgame. What we have is a janky, grind-railed version of Diablo gameplay, without any of the fun that Diablo loot and builds provide.
---
This game isn't diet MMO... it's no kind of MMO, period, or else every single online multiplayer game is an MMO and you've effectively diluted the definition so much it's become worthless. :/
---
I mean good god this game doesn't even have TEXT CHAT, how can it be an MMO? xD
---
That's what I'm wondering!?
---
Yeah, I absolutely hate GTFO Timers.  They need to stop that crap or at least give you 5 f-ing minutes, come on.
---
Mines the daughter of a firefighter dad and a surgeon mom who got selected for the vault but her parents didn't so to honor their memory she travels the wasteland healing and helping people. She eventually discovered the responders and took the fire breather name a little too literally (she was real young when she went into the vault) and now heals teammates with a flamer. (Friendly fire).
---
Cool in game name is Jias Id be happy to throw some caps your way.
---
Appreciate it!
---
I agree that private servers being free is a bit unreasonable but unlimited scrap should definitely be free. Also Bethesda did say in there marketing stages of the game that the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic only, by Pete Hines on multiple occasions. The fact that any tweets in which he did say this have now been deleted only confirms that Bethesda and Pete knows how they look given that there is a "utility" (i.e. not cosmetic) section in the Atomic Shop.
---
That's not the entire point of it. The entire point of it is to make Bethesda money, and you have no idea how much of that money goes to support the game. 
---
You're running free spin for the suits, and that's all you're doing.
---
Again putting words in my mouth, y’all are really good at that. When did I ever say loot boxes are good? I didn’t but go ahead say I did. 
---
Yeah it lost its player base cause how did for honor launch? Broken it was broken on launch with P2P servers? 
---
Where is the game now? Much better, in a far 
---
better state than 76. 
---
If you don’t think for honor has good pricing but $18 power armor skins is? What world do you live in
---
I did it with my fancy shotgun just the other day. Made me wounder for a second if it was considered a rifle for about a minute, like how pipe rifles where considered still pistols for perk cards.
---
Been saying just this for a while now, should have been a feature added to tinker bench. Could have been easy too, scrap all you unused ammo for components and make new ammo. For the life of me I can't understand why they had to screw the pooch and make a new craptastic machine instead of implementing something that, A. already existed in a previous version of Fallout and, B. would have actually worked, infinitely better to boot.
---
Ran into the same issue. Ended up saying fuck it and went with the raiders quest line
---
They should add a settlers at one of the silos setting up a random assortment of transmitters and bot parts.  
---
"The protection head sensors watch the silo exit for the the missiles that launch regularly. When it detects one it sends a transmission pulse that others can set their clocks by. I call it my Atomic Clock service."
---
And I’m mad salty because the Chinese stealth suit is essential to my build
---
I’m hardly a game developer, but if that’s possible, then yeah, that just might work.
---
They would preferably round up instead of down in that case, but I suppose that it wouldn’t really make that much of a difference unless you’re scrapping thousands of rounds at one time (which for some people isn’t actually out of the question, now that I think about it).
---
Good advice, yeah I wait till people show up anyways to save on ammo for whatever I’m using lol
---
They should have leveraged the existing system (workbenches) for junking ammo into ammo points complete with selection slider to choose how much to get rid of.
---
The reworked ammo converter is still complete trash with how slow, cumbersome, and shitty it is to use.  
---
I should be able to craft whatever ammo I want from the workbench using points.  If they needed a Ammo (Points) category to make it work right and not break the existing crafting ammo from materials that would have been fine.
---
yes, the plans count as bullion rewards and thus are untradable.
---
Had this happen too.
---
Somebody else said there's not a lot you can do but there is, it's just hard learned and occasionally trial and error.
---
Like they said keep your camp device out in the open, on ground, not a foundation. If your foundations are too high and the device is on top the pet will spawn in on it and get stuck in the foundation and die.
---
Especially sloths. They're big and have pathing issues.
---
They're drawn to that camp device so if you're seeing them get stuck, roaring a lot, fading in and out, you need to move it somewhere they can access better.
---
I also recommend a few turrets to protect them, they have high health but can be easily overwhelmed by only a few enemies. If enemies spawn in near your camp when you load in then that means they will for others too, and if you have vending people coming by when you're not there can be problematic. They might not care and just leave without dealing with enemies or AFK resulting in enemies destroying stuff and potentially the pet. Even two lowest quality turrets in the forest will make a big difference as long as they're pointed right. Allies help a bit, YMMV.
---
Get yourself a shishkebab to heal them with the Friendly Fire perk.
---
Finally, and most important, don't log out at camp.
---
I've kept a sloth for six months this way. Logging in and out at camp causes some kind of bug that can kill your sloths and deathclaws. I don't know if it's dropping them from a high height or what, but this will help a lot.
---
Really? It might be an issue with the quest itself then, i was thinking it had something to do with my end.
---
My main character already went with the raiders but the settler story looks very interesting so I decided to try it out. Can't wait to get done with this terrible quest.
---
Good observation.
---
Certified badass here with duplicated God tier gear.
---
You can get the stealth suit if you get the rep high enough with them even if you went raider
---
Legendary run
---
'Buy or sell an item from another player 3 times'
---
Hell, I'll buy all your shotgun shells, in 3 transactions.
---
And the lack of interesting new rewards added to the game after 2 years of development has nothing to do with that, right?
---
It's not like they're starving the playerbase of cool new rewards (that most other online games provide) just so those people are desperate for any kind of reward that's interesting and new, therefore are more likely to spend money instead of playing the game and earning rewards in the immersion of the universe provided.
---
Naw, no link there at all. rofl.
---
Spongy? And here I wish he were beefier. My two shot ultracite gatling gun solo-decimates him in less than 12-15 seconds. (With the right perks of course)
---
And yet we could actually have all that stuff if we bought everything each week, so idk.
---
I read about this and thought it was the weapon I was using so I changed it up. No difference.
---
It’s honestly better than I was expecting. Some games are buttery smooth with like ten people then others are laggy with two. The boss is pretty tanky if you’re doing public games since a lot of lower levels join but they’re trying their best. 
---
I like how chaotic the room is and I’m hoping some cheesy meta doesn’t come out like hiding in a corner or something to ruin it.
---
Good thing the games not free to play then
---
But that one night of partying has to take place while completing 'violent night' for the exps...
---
We're playing a game where I caught nuclear herpes from a giant mutant bat yelling at me. I think we're well beyond striving for realism.
---
&gt; "I have to go now. My planet needs me."
---
I don't mind loading up a low level character with stuff even if he has a high level alt.  Just pass it on when you get a chance and help someone else out when you are able to.
---
Frankly I'm happy to drop a bunch of stuff that's just taking up room anyway.
---
Again, the game gets dropped or put on life support if it doesn't make money. That's just how business works. They don't owe us anything we don't pay for.   
---
If you want to see it get better, you push for change and give them the resources to make that change happen.   
---
In 76's case it IS pathetic, a lot of the time. This game is so fucking backwards in it's development that it hurts. But saying 'Hey, we're going to take away all your funding and expect you to still give a shit about the game' isn't how these companies work.
---
You know plenty of modders were and are against the creation club to?
---
For honor has destroyed its game. Went from taking some skill...to now spamming light attacks. Go play black desert and complain there. They charge $34 for a outfit....lmfao.
---
Damn......... well my stealth sniper is only level 80. I guess I could start over.
---
I know but fuck I don’t wanna deal with that grind but I’m totally gonna lol
---
Permanent. Until it gets pulled, reworked, re-released, pulled again, reworked a second time, pulled again then abandoned completely
---
I support this question
---
Well. Ok.
---
or just grind the reputation and gold till you can just buy the suit?
---
Dang I was just thinking that the other day. Beat me to posting it. I accidentally tossed my Garb of Mystery and would love to get a new one but the fabricator only allows one. Would love to be able to get another one from like a vendor or something.
---
I hope you’re right!
---
I was just about to say.  
---
Also don't make ultracite its a terrible power armour, just simply terrible.
---
What ammo converter? I wasn't aware of any ammo converter. Yep, I feel better already.
---
Thursday
---
How about in the game as rewards for time spent playing and successfully beating challenges... ya know, the essential formula for games before the advent of MTX garbage that was implemented to make shareholders and greedy shits rich? xD
---
Our god Todd has isekaied Earle.
---
Yeah I just got my alt (now my main lol, being an unarmed predator is brutally fun) to 55 after about 2 weekends.
---
Charleston DMV for lots of ghouls, Grafton Steel Mill for super mutants, Whitesprings for ghouls, WestTek for super mutants, and some ghouls at Fort Defiance. I got a couple levels from doing events like Uranium Fever, Radiation Rumble, and Line in the Sand (all on public) cuz of the crazy amounts of enemies that spawn.
---
Inspirational for +15% exp (in a group), sleep for +5%, brain fungus soup for +2 INT (dunno what exp bonus INT is), cranberry relish is +5% (I think?), lunchboxes are +25% if you got them, and a public building team can get +4 INT.
---
Didn't really do much questing (events can be amazing though), just lots of killing.
---
Very few, and mostly the ones that can't get in.   
---
Ever heard of Elianora? She was a champion of the 'Forever Free' bullcrap that started with the Steam modding fiasco (It was a legitimately broken service, creation club fixed it's issues)   
---
Now that she's actually in the creation club? She's got nothing but praise. Hell, I've applied to the CC, I work with people in the CC. They're literally at capacity right now because of the sheer volume of people applying.
---
I feel you. I am slowly putting everything back to how it wqs, but is it tedious...
---
Dude we are the customers to Bethesda. We don't need to thank them for the scraps that they do throw us even though those scraps are getting smaller.
---
Many online services do offer free routes to get premium currencies, some do not and others have earned premium currencies and superior paid currencies.
---
Realistically Bethesda would be crazy to remove free atoms given the state of the game and the poor quality of atomic shop releases.
---
Is that the SBQ for the Upper East Side?
---
No, it shouldn't be for F01st members only.
---
Yes they should add more character slots though
---
I imagine very few people run into this problem, and so I doubt they will change it.
---
Everything they sell is already in game taking up your hard drive space. As for having varying different assess, they already accommodate that by having a budget for each camp.
---
It's not like grand theft auto where they load the entire world. Camps load when you go to them, so it takes a little bit for it to appear. They are already accommodating all the different assets.
---
 All they have to really worry about is people going over that server's budget too far using glitches, which will lag the server. Not about diversity of items but how many items total their are.
---
Cool in theory. But what do with the extra characters after your fo1st expires? Which character should get locked back up? 
---
May be better to flip it around- new character slots permanently unlocked by Atoms.
---
Go on Xbox.com it's under subscriptions on your profile bit. I had the same issue as I'm sure you used to be able to do it from the console
---
I like how that's the only thing you got from my post. Anything good in game has been duped, all the major traders have a supply chain. Like if you know the right people you can get anything in game for free. I never traded or paid a dime for my 5 alts packed with God tier weaponry and armor sets. They do excellent for testing. The gear I actually use is a handmade(easy to trade for and aquire, one of the most duped items in the game, on all the trade networks), a set of sent uny AP marine, with life saving left arm and chameleon left leg, a set that took me a while to collect and is now on the trade networks because I let someone borrow it. Mostly I use a melee, because it's funnier and takes out any advantage of the sent gear I use. If you play around on the site nukes and dragons you can test all the numbers you want for PvP and builds, trade for the gear you need. It take one to two rare weapons to trade for a full set. With a group of players everyone can get sets in the span of a month. And that's if they don't just talk to the right people and make friends. Dont act like my gear has anything to do with badassedry, anyone can do my build in a month, you can trade for the gear to make it work really easily.
---
He activated a stealth boy you guys gave up too soon.
---
We’ll get em next time.
---
We went in with 4 of us.  Maybe 3 tank style heavy gunners and one high level guy that isn't optimized but isn't bad either.
---
The four of us were able to beat it with about 5 minutes to spare.   The 4th guy was doing a lot of melee, I was shooting the wendigos colossus in the face with a Gatling plasma. The other two heavy gunners were using ultracite ammo (5mm and 50 cal I believe)
---
You need to make ballistic boch beer.  Get it from Biv if you haven't finished those daily quests for recipes.  I needed and used High Voltage Hefe, and psycho and psychotats when I could.  Not sure what buffs if any my other teammates use.  One of them doesn't use anything and I'm not sure if the other two do or not.  Overdrive. One of them uses overdrive.
---
Not sure how it works on Xbox but on PS4 I canceled all auto renews on my PSN account and that worked, I couldn't do it for Fallout 1st specifically, just all auto renews so from now on I have to do my PSN Plus manually.
---
His owner just didn't want him anymore so he took him out into the woods and left him :-(....
---
You see I only go to owned shops when I know I’ll win
---
Heck yeah buddy, ammo factory is where its at! Don't need to convert shit, just churn it out til my pockets are spilling with shells.
---
Like all the bullion shit, reputation shit, legendary run shit, event shit?   
---
No link, what are you on? Content is sparse because the team is fucking backward, but there's always a reward to get. And again - If this whole thing is to justify your argument that 'Microtransactions should be free', then I'm afraid you're just not getting the point of microtransactions in any application, in any game, ever.
---
Tru. That's how workshops work. I'll take all of yours if you touch mine.
---
Thanksssss
---
lol no
---
Yep exactly
---
Nobody is "paying for (me)".  I, and others don't owe any gratitude towards people dropping money on the game in any way whatsoever. That's not how it works.  
---
I'm not forced to buy microtransactions, but pretty much every game with microtransactions affects players whether they buy them or not.  Games like this are made, and designed around milking players to spend money, so even if I don't buy them, I still feel their effects on the game. And now look at how Bethesda has slowly and steadily treaded the waters seeing how much they could change and get away with since the game has first come out.
---
This i agree with to an extent. In a comment of mine I made I said private severed should be free but I take that back. The scrap box and survival tent should be free, but I understand why private servers should be behind a paywall. 
---
Listen this game has a lot of ways to make income. And I mean a lot the battle pass is just another one they added recently. Let alone they’ll find a way for more ways to nickel and dime us in the future.
---
They took a way for us to earn atoms to get items in the shop. They weren’t giving out atoms for free players had to earn them. 
---
The atom shop in my opinion has ludicrous prices (why I bring up a PA skin caps cost $18) 
---
Putting content all players should have like the scrap box and survival tent behind a paywall is not ok at all. 
---
Putting skins behind a paywall, that’s ok with me. 
---
But with the amount of ways this game is monetized and the state is is even with a year and a half out the doors. It’s unbelievably unacceptable.
---
If you run in first person try running in third person. Or vice versa.
---
No, you are not crazy.
---
my Non pa Armor is 3x Bolstering WR heavy metal, 1x vanguard WR heavy metal, and 1x chameleon WR heavy metal.
---
 DR is about 330.
---
My Excavator has DR about 240.

When Fallout 76 makes money, Zenimax is more inclined to push resources their way to continue it's development and support. If the game doesn't make money? Then it's going on life support or in the worst case scenario, being terminated. These things just don't run on nothing.
---
Yes always stockpile the main ammo food groups. You generally don't need .38, 40mm, missiles and mini nukes.
---
You are not an auto build so are doing OK, but will very likely run into bullet spongy enemies around lv 30s. No getting around it. 
---
Try pushing through from lv 30 to 45 using events with many people, rather than farming. It's how I've levelled every character except my first for that lv 30 to 45 hump.
---
I was able to place the Circus trailer but there is no slot for the door
---
But can I do anything with the 40 TD I currently have in my stash?
---
Actually, you can blueprint the ammo factory from that factory and place it in a camp or workshop. Works like a charm.
---
I think it has been discussed somewhere by the developers. They said that they have no plans for it in the near future but it might be implemented way in the future. Might have heard it in one of juiceheads videos on youtube
---
Sadly they recently stated that they have no plans to add additional character slots but are instead going to try and make it easier to switch perk load outs. Given how much money additional character slots could make them in the atomic shop and assuming they’ve got to be intelligent enough to realize that, I have to believe that for whatever reason(s)/tech/engine/base code limitations they just do not have the ability to implement this.
---
Speaking of which am I the only one who would love to see something similar to a mole miner but with power armor?
---
Make 5.56, trade it for 2mm in converter. Someone did the maths on here and found 5.56 was most economical for converting.
---
 That’s good!
---
GaaS is a scam model that should be frustrated at all costs.
---
Ok I’ll add you and I should be on at some point tonight. If I don’t catch you today I’ll keep checking. IGN McSanchez
---
 Honestly I agree, I was really expecting this game to be every man for himself. It seems as if the community really did end up becoming a good team.
---
Buy modules from murm then craft them at an armor workbench when you have the plan learned.  Idk about them straight up dropping from the purveyor..
---
Once upon a time games were supported by a series of one-time purchases. Game, then expansion, etc. 
---
MTX makes more money at the expense of the consumers enjoyment.
---
Next generation nukes can time travel so
---
I mean, it is. I have legendary run rewards available on all characters. Only some, like scrip and kits stay on the character that claimed them.
---
You could, but that would make selling 1 bullet give 0 points. And if you round up, selling 1 bullet becomes optimal as you get 20% free points. Either way, rounding may not even be something the system is capable of since it may deal only in whole numbers (integers) at the moment. Changing to a floating point value may have unforeseen consequences if other systems depend on integer division to function
---
It's incredibly easy, mostly boring and bugged beyond belief.
---
The spectacle is ok.
---
Id be fine with just like 1 scrip per completion....gives a reason to play longer then 30 mins to get our treasury notes and log off
---
I run 4 fully built characters, A sniper, an Unarmed Brawler, A Commando, and a Heavy Gunner! It basically means I'm never going to be able to take advantage of the Legendary perks...
---
It’s the same with lode baring!
---
You don't owe it, never said you do. But it's an irrefutable fact.  
---
Be gracious to them or not, they're paying for free content updates to the game.  
---
This game wouldn't receive support if it didn't make money.
---
If I've said this once, I've said it a thousand times. The second I there's something with stats sold on the atomic shop, or bullion, scrip, whatever. Stuff that lets you 'skip to the end', I'll join in and protest. Hell, I've done it before. But complaining that you can't get free premium currency to spend on skins and costumes is a little pathetic.
---
Pulled a sneaky on ya
---
Yeah, the secret service jetpacks really need cosmetics!
---
If instead of, after converting ammo, hitting a and going to the menu, hit b and go to the menu and backing up so you dont have to spam be to exit
---
I can’t imagine there’s that many people who pay for stuff in the shop
---
Sure is, don't disagree. Wouldn't play the game at all if it wasn't Fallout.
---
Workbench? You can hold the view/options button to contest/take a workshop
---
based reluctant player
---
yea kind of, but if you can control the event you can try to get more out of it
---
Exactly! I don’t even think F76 has done a great job with marketing or sales, but using Ubi and For Honour as a precedent isn’t even logical
---
Must be, they've starting upping the atomic shop content a lot.   
---
And we've been getting more and more 'plans for the future' crap dropped on us.   
---
I suppose you can read it however you like, but clearly the game's getting enough support to justify more long term content.
---
Not today, but heard by tommorrow Thursday
---
Multiplying by 10 may not work, there could be a case where ammo is worth some number of hundredths as well. Then you’re multiplying by a 100 for the values of points. That does work, but could result in overflow of the menu space or some other problem. It’s not as simple on the backend as just multiplying up. Without knowing the data types and structures there could be limits we aren’t seeing.
---
If using the vendor inventory was simple, they would’ve already done it. They did for the legendary coins and for gold. Something about the exchange rates must be the issue given that this is the only interface to not work with the vendor setup. Doing the extra work of making a new terminal interface would (almost) certainly be the last resort rather than the first thing a development team did.
---
To your point about exchange rates, the existing rates were chosen for some balancing reason. There may not exist a whole number conversion that the developers thought was properly balanced. The bulk quantities are based on the lowest whole number multiple of a given per bullet cost, rather than chosen arbitrarily. They probably determined that a .50 that is made in a batch of 100 should be worth X amount less than a .45 made in a batch of 12 for instance.
---
I absolutely do think it’s weird how they handled it, but they may be dealing with constraints of an engine they did not develop and with decisions that were made by developers back when FO4 was made without decimal cap values.
---
Please note that I’m not trying to justify their actions, but rather offering an explanation for why the current dev team may not be able to just switch to a new interface

Wipe out the mutants then server hop rinse and repeat. 
---
Obviously use something that's not your hunting rifle for taking them out personally I find the bow to be reasonably effective with just the glow sight upgrade.
---
You use them crafting and modding weapons mostly. So if you are crafting weapons to scrap for learning mods in early game or crafting weapons and armor in end game to apply ledgendary modules. A player can go through a butt ton of them.  It just happens to be the resource you run out of when crafting.
---
Lol
---
I got a medic guass mini...thought it was junk lol
---
This pleases Chally
---
I think it’s close to that, but not quite. The .50 MG is the only gun that will use .50 cal without any needing to mod it from base, whereas the other two guns that can take it require mods. That being said, the idea behind it is that you will more often than not be shooting a LOT of them if you’re shooting .50 cal bullets in the first place. 100 is pretty balanced for the amount you’ll probably be carrying
---
Welcome to FO76. I learned early on to not trust the quest markers completely. Just run around the area and the marker will most likely pop up randomly.
---
My team, “Moo-Tang Clan” has set up outposts (CAMP) and forward stations (survival tents) at
---
all previous Prime Cuts locations and of course near Grahm’s hourly cookout. Ammo well overstocked. Stash boxes optimized. Our bodies are ready. See you there!
---
I mean that would be great, but I know that the most likely way will be in the AS, but Id just like to see the content regardless.
---
Oooweeee he sure do have a pretty mouth.
---
Definitely a camp leftover , somebody left him all sad and lonely
---
You don’t need to actually reach the workbench
---
to claim a workshop.
---
Or you could just spend money on the game if you don't already have enough free atoms from the season rewards?  You know?  Buying atoms to buy cosmetics?  The basis on which the game was supposed to support all of the free story content?
---
Want to know what would happen with your idea even if it was implemented?
---
First you'd have people whining that it's "only" 200 atoms a week and not even enough to buy a single PA skin.
---
Then you'd have the people who can only play for two hours every other Wednesday whining about how you're discriminating against people with full time jobs and families to support.
---
Then you'd have the people that complain about  time gated content whining about how you LITERALLY locked free atoms behind a literal timed gate.
---
I totally respect that. And because I respect that, I NEVER claim a workshop on a public server.
---
I hope Daguerre scales to defend my base too...
---
Yes! And if you’re in power armor toggle the HUD display in settings.
---
The system may not be able to track any floating value. If you’re only storing integers (whole numbers) they tend to get truncated. That means the decimal is dropped. I’ll give a very basic and oversimplified answer
---
Normally If you have 1 and add .8 you get 1.8, add another you get 2.6 and so on
---
If you’re using truncated values, you start with 1 and add .8. You still get 1 because only left of the decimal place is saved. 
---
If their system actually works like this, then there is no .8 value option for caps/points. They would only have whole numbers or it will just default back to 0. With the current exchange rates, they need decimals, but their data type may not allow it and they may well lack the ability to change it. If they made an item in such a system with a value of .8, it would be saved as 0.
---
An example of a place where this does work is with ammo weight, counted to the thousandth. If caps and vendors are not set up to handle decimal values like I initially stated then it all breaks and they need a new system like the crap one we got
---
But, you can lie and get more money off him.
---
The whole system is a complete pain in the a** 
---
9/10 times I'm a couple of rounds short of even the minimum for some rounds. I'd love to just be able to dump all the ammo that I don't want into the machine, let it process the ammo and then choose the ammo that I need. 
---
Quite often I'm running low on 308 for the LMG which I favour over the .50 HMG in indoor spaces / mid range enemies that would otherwise take 2-3 5.56 mags to put down (why are charred &amp; glowing ghouls so frickin tanky)
---
You have the full support of Moo Gang for your efforts of worshiping our goddess Chally. May your milk never dry up brother!
---
You can still access the scrap box if you cancel you just can’t add anything
---
mAybe make a big barn for it with your camp device in middle.   and turrets to protect it.  Also some players kill peoples pets
---
Hi, this may be the wrong place to ask this but I’m not seeing a daily question thread and this thread seems really helpful lol. 
---
I have maxed my sneak rifle build and got all my perk cards topped off and I’m not real sure what to do with my level ups. Do people normally just max random cards so they can play whatever builds whenever they want? Thanks for any help.
---
I'm also curious about the scrap kits, said it sends it to a scrap box , how does that work for now fo first people?
---
Honestly, if this plays like shit for you, and they don't do anything about it. Why are you even playing it? I'd just drop it and move on to something else, but chances are no one is ever gonna add servers for south america for any game ever.
---
This was pretty much my thought, definitely don't want to lose a toon.
---

if yoh dont have first you cant access someone elses scrap box.  if you buy it for a month then cancel you can only take your scrap out but not add any more.

---
That's just server lag causing the health bar to rubber band if I'm not mistaken
---
ya just lie
---
May your teats never clog, brutters.
---
I stand corrected! Apologies. I was looking at Zenimax studios thinking it was the media group.
---
I still don’t exactly agree with your initial comment, as equity groups have large portfolios and aren’t going to be focused on micromanaging a single company. Most investors are looking for as little need to step in as possible, as it just means more time taken away from other deals/more important jobs. They most likely wouldn’t even comment on BGS as it’s a subsidiary of a subsidiary. Seems more likely the issues would be internal communication and have much less to do with bottom line, since BGS and Zenimax studio are both doing well, even if F76 weren’t turning a large profit.
---
I'm not grateful for a developer filling its own obligation to deliver a non-buggy, finished product months to years after its release under the guise of 'free updates'.  
---
Maybe when they start fixing every blatant issue(s) that have been around since release, we can talk about gratitude for continued support, but until then, if this game were to hypothetically cease support tomorrow, I wouldn't be blaming other people for not paying enough to keep game support, which is basically who you suggest hold this game on their shoulders like a burden.  I'd be blaming Bethesda for not making their game well-designed enough to interest others enough to buy the game in the first place.
---
Go to imgur and post a picture there and link it here.
---
Like I said I did clock it
---
If you don't have 1st you can't access someone else's stashbox.
---
If you do subscribe and fill your stashbox and then cancel first, you can keep stashbox and contents but you won't be able to add items to stash until you are subscribed again.
---
If you're using scrap kits in your inventory and don't have 1st it will send junk to your stash box, if you don't have enough stash space to store everything it will give you a warning that not all scrap will go into stash if you proceed, alternatively you can also cancel and not send scrap to stash. If you do have 1st everything goes right to stashbox.
---
Edited for accuracy.
---
LOL, you're terribly missinformed. Tons of games have servers in SA, csgo, fortnite, pubg,  Valorant, need for speed online games that I played and Left 4 Dead just to mention some. It's basically a industry standard to offer servers close to the regions where you make the game available for purchasing.
---
I'm a long date fan of the Fallout series and I really want to play this game, that's why.
---
edit: grammar
---
I agree that a better plan would be to open it up. I actually have two friends who are HARD-CORE players who used multiple profiles out the gate and were willing to shell out for each profile in the shop (which I find INSANE).
---
I just claim it for the daily and take off
---
Shotguns are not good against the queen unless they are magically bugged. Also, the queen has strong "armor" and only combat shotguns can be modded to perforate. Two handed melee + antiarmor is a safe bet.

I would argue but I don't want you shooting me with your magic gun. 🤐

I would like there to be a major consequence for abusing the nukes, like Watoga becoming practically like the glowing sea and uninhabitable.
---
We kill the Scorchbeats and in return have made the are around their nest lethal to human habitation.  
---
I thought it was weird they went that way to the Colossus I am guessing they needed some mechanic to limit the event but they should of tried literally anything else. Like having to make a small  non-nuclear bomb to blow the hole open to the mine.
---
&gt; It’s not as simple on the backend as just multiplying up.
---
That's not my main argument, just an "they could also do this" argument. I've given them two ways to solve this problem. All they need to do is come up with different numbers, the current numbers are arbitrary anyways. 
---
&gt; If using the vendor inventory was simple, they would’ve already done it. 
---
That's an awful argument - implying that they make the best choices consistently is ridiculous, have you seen the A Colossal Problem clusterfuck? They've been testing this event for months and it's still not ready. You're just not willing to let yourself accept the most obvious case, which is that someone botched this. Is that really so hard for you to believe? This game has a notorious lack of QA, they clearly were sweating on time and someone's judgement was impaired leading to the awful idea to use a terminal UI. Tons of failures make it into the game, this happened to be one of them. They probably had one person do this terminal thing and no one QA'd it until it was too late to delay. Pretty simple stuff 
---
&gt; To your point about exchange rates, the existing rates were chosen for some balancing reason.
---
The current numbers are *hardly* perfect and I see exactly no reason they couldn't do a rebalance with different base numbers. Please dude, stop these straw grasping rationalizations. The simple answer is clear. 
---
&gt; but they may be dealing with constraints of an engine they did not develop
---
The *engine*? Wtf, this has nothing to do with engine constraints, they've got this UI working on three separate currencies, it's totally implausible that the engine is precluding a fourth one. Laughable argument, honestly.
---
&gt; Please note that I’m not trying to justify their actions
---
I really don't care about this angle, I frequently defend Bethesda from uninformed and unfair criticism. In this case, mine is neither.
---
Neither am I. It was a joke.
---
And my response was when was the reset before that reset, because if it had just reset it would change the clock to 20 hrs from that new point not original reset point. 
---
So wait a whole extra day, if you still don't get a reset to 150 then you have an issue. If you do get 150 again then you missed the reset window.
---
You don't need to show gratitude. That's what I just said.   
---
I've never said you had to, and I've never really talked about the state of the game.   
---
All I've said in response to your point is that you have to acknowledge that the whales that keep buying things on the Atomic Shop are actively giving this game Value to Zenimax and giving them justification to keep putting time and resources into supporting 76.
---
My first and only time in Live last night had me and a few friends with some randoms fighting, and my AA Gauss Pistol was doing between 40-70 damage (i.e. nothing), I spent most of the fight leaping around doing Spider-Man tactics (dodging and keeping threats busy) and dying, and by the end I think there were maybe three or four of us left in the instance. Whether the others crashed or just left is unknown. 
---
What I do know is my Gauss Pistol broke mid fight from over-repaired, so Repair Kits are a standard and shitty requirement. If you haven't stockpiled Improved Kits and run out of SCORE ones, then the fight has elements of Pay to Win now unless you carry backup guns that can do anything resembling damage to the Colossus.
---
Make sure to collect the rolling pin was great haha, but thx fof the leg tip
---
Fallout 76 does offer free routes to get the premium currency, and im not saying they shouldnt. Im saying we should be thankful for all the free atoms we got beforehand. It was easily possible to never purchase atoms to buy whatever ATX stuff you wanted. That realistically cannot fly in a cosmetic-payed support system like that. That huge free atom flow was never going to last, im just thankful we got as many as we did
---
Yeah they're essentially double damage and double swing speed. It's like a 5 star weapon, especially if you mod it to sharp.
---
it did. ty
---
Forgot to add, enjoy your .38
---
Ward is broken about 80% of the time.  If he would just let me process the quest, that would be great.  And I don’t like his attitude.  I’ve killed dozens of people for him, he can stop acting as if he can’t trust me.  Although maybe murdering dozens of people makes you untrustworthy?
---
Broadcast One More Pils through your microphone if you're able to during the entire event.
---
They should let other foundations snap to them, but no.
---
where did you get the info about cancelling first making your stash go over 800? because im pretty sure that isnt a thing.
---
That helps....but just a little bit.
---
Happens all the time for me with my shotguns :D
---
Yeah, I accidentally killed a lvl 20 before realizing it because they came running up behind me while claiming a workshop guns out.
---
lol I usually hack them so they make .308 just to mess with them.
---
If they already are making .308 I switch them to missiles
---
Geodome is a great example of this.
---
Every other item in the green thumb bundle is still on there, minus that one.
---
1200 for one bonus item is some salty bs.

Oh God, don't watch this [video](https://youtu.be/-e_hCU4y76Q) then. They duo'd it in like 3 minutes.

Fookin Nuke Zone should have massive environmental changes, like, should look like yourn trapped out in The Mist; just shadows of monsters passing by, alien to all known justifications of life  
---
aswell we need some mutated cryptids (and more importantly) mutated aliens. I wanna see what a nuke or some FEV, or both, does to a Flatwoods Monster
---
I figured .38 is more annoying lol. I just unlocked all of them ASAP, had someone kill me for the bounty and just hopped around them for a bit. Just going to burn the 50 on a gun I never use
---
And I'm telling you there's no worthy acknowledgement within any of that.  Not as a customer.
---
Yeah. If you're on Xbox, Xbox handles your billing and not Bethesda. Cancel on Xbox under account and subscriptions.
---
Try to make the thorn armor is even worse. Server hop for the steel. Then you’re at the mercy of the nocturnal gods for the legendary effects on them...
---
I can agree with that, the tent or at the very, very least the scrapbox should be free. It's borderline insane that they aren't.   
---
I do hesitate at the 'They weren't giving it to us for free, we had to earn them' part, I think that might be overestimating the playerbase. They were free, lets be real - People were earning hundreds every week and buying whatever they wanted off the store without paying a dime. And while that's nice for them, a business just can't function like that.   
---
But yeah, the state of this game is rubbish, will never contest that. It needs a ridiculous amount of work still at a much faster pace.
---
thats not what i asked, i asked where you learned that. because from what i've experienced, after cancelling 1st all my scrap in my scrapbox stayed in the scrap box, it didnt magically move to the stash box and go over 800. i kept the scrap box, i just couldnt add to it anymore.
---
I'm guessing whom ever build it thought this would keep someone from stealing it from them or or are just a total ass hat
---
Congrats on finding the Interloper on your own. Stumbling on that thing without any prior knowledge of it must have been a real trip.
---
Well lv 20 molerat can survive a Two shot mirv Fatman.
---
If that's the case now they must have changed it but it used to collapse content space stashbox became moved to stash.   
---
When did you cancel?
---
I'd rather pay for the dlc if it meant it's on time and mostly bug free and get free cosmetics.
---
A even bigger issue that should grind on you is the cut Todd takes of the ammo we collected and stored.  Todd takes 60 to 70% in the act of scraping to resources and crafting into the ammo received.  IRL it would be maybe 10% loss.  But that is why the machine won't trade a .38 for a .44
---
I set them to gamma rounds
---
Most people would just use it for extra mule storage so it's unlikely.
---
But if you're on PC or Xbox with game pass it's easy to add a "new" Xbox free account on the same system and just create another stack of characters on that account.
---
If you did Fasnacht, it's somewhat similar event.  It happens on the top of every hour near V76. It's either gather (guts &amp; plants), turn the meat, bang on the drums, pick up Chally's poo or rotten guts. AFK'er happen, not a big deal.  There are events every 15 minutes across the map to turn in special meats for buffs and scrip.
---
What’s a cursed pick axe
---
You should've titled your post "A Colossal Waste of Time". Missed a trick there.
---
1. Get rid of the different currencies. Keep caps for normal items, and use gold bullion for end game stuff. Get rid of scrip (just convert it 1:1 into bullion), and get rid of treasury notes. Just award bullion and skip the middle step. 
---
2. Let us trade bullion with other players, and accept it in vending machines.
---
3. Remove the daily vendor cap and bullion limits, and change the maximums to an account limit, not per character. 
---
4. Give us a special stash box that has a small weight limit, but can be accessed by all characters on the account so we can transfer items.
---
5. Make the settler/raider reputation levels account wide. Grinding that for each character is ridiculous. 
---
6. Give us a way to respec our special points, instead of grinding 10-20  levels to move points. 
---
7. Completely scrap/rework the legendary perk system, because the current system is completely broken.
---
How are so many people oblivious to Bethesda's money grabbing tactics?
---
They gave us the ability to get atoms for free **before** The Legendary Run. They then drastically reduced the total amount of atoms you could earn for free. Not only did they reduce how many atoms we could earn, they also increased the workload into getting the atoms.
---
Even after looking at the changes to atoms many people defend Bethesda and their decision to do so. I don't agree with their decision to lower the amount of free atoms whatsoever.
---
I also don't know where this idea comes from that atom purchases are dire for funding this game. First off they are selling this game its not free. Secondly they have a subscription service put in place which is even more income.
---
Wake up people Bethesda doesn't care about majority of you. 
---
They just care about your wallets.
---
A bug that's been unfixed since beta!
---
i got a month when 1st first came out, cancelled the auto-renewel, and went without it for about four months before resubscribing. and during those four months i had a LOT of stuff sitting in my scrap box.
---
and everyone i spoke to who cancelled 1st at any point said the same- your scrap already added to the scrap box stays in the scrap box, you just cant add to it anymore.
---
On top of this, Nuclear Sites are now neigh unusable with people server hopping to grind the new events.  
---
Same with the key card tracking repeatable.  
---
I haven't seen a single Site with turrets in for the past two days.
---
No, it only kills you.
---
The converter from the score does but I'm referring to the constructor from max rep with the Raiders.
---
I’m new to the game, sorry if it’s a redundant post
---
What? I have no idea what you're trying to say.   
---
My point basically boils down to -   
---
Saying: "Buying things from the atomic shop doesn't add value to the game in the eyes of it's owners and justify further development and support" Would be untrue.   
---
There's really no disputing that. That's all I'm saying. By acknowledging that you're just saying 'Yeah, If something is making money, the owners will support it more', which is just common sense. I'm not sure why the 'acknowledging' part is an issue here.
---
It drops from the new event.
---
When legendary perks are released theres one called ammo factory which at max rank gives 150% more ammo. + the 80% from Alamo smith perk and possibly times 2 from super duper. Lots of ammo.
---
I mean Chally has never left? She has been wandering the lands with Grahm?
---
Nah not redundant, always fun to see the clones, it's fun to line them up.
---
If they won’t go into the slot, they aren’t active. I’m not sure why this happens and they stay in your inventory but if you had the quest active and turned in TD and some remained in your inventory they are burned. Sell them to a vendor bot for a cap each.
---
"claim" the entirety of appalachia?  
---
Theyre the miners from pre-war, theyre defending their rightful, bought and paid for homesteads. First from the corrupt corporations and government trying to oust them on the cheap for a chance at ultracite, then again to the post-war militant factions looking to take anything not nailed down as their personal property.  
---
Mole Miners are victims and defenders in a war of aggression.
---
I run 4 separate characters, in theory I can have unlimited characters, so right now I have 20 slots. I play on XB1. Only downside, is you don't get stuff from the atomic shop and need to be earned separately. It's an alternative, more character slots would be better obviously.
---
I guess this is why they're nerfing melee as well - what Beth giveth they taketh away too!
---
If that was the case, they would be unicorns.
---
Well yeah you stealth melee'd him, that's the most op you can go
---
That's a shame.
---
She wanders the land spreading the word of the MooGang but on this special time she will be here for al lof us to worship
---
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. I stopped using my other characters because I want at least one of them to have a full set of Secret Service armor and reputation.
---
It is sad, stupid and it SHORTENS the game's lifespan.
---
I like it. But I get their thought on making some things non-tradeable. Duplication glitches will remain and it will ruin the game even if there's a small community with a glitch they aren't disclosing. I'm an old school Vanilla WoW player. I still remember gear there being an accomplishment. And I'd like to see that on the top tier here as well.
---
BETA player here...Overwatch was really the only online game i played
---
So i created Jack Morrison
---
Soldier/Vault Dweller from 76
---
I know its our vault but when Meg first referred to me as "76" it felt extra on the nose
---
I go 'round the wastes helping those in need
---
I didnt start this war, war never changes
---
Leader of the Pack is great. 2 events, 3 legendaries, and some low level weapons and armor for your leveling baby.
---
“Have you ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?”
---
Please put Davenport outside.  Load screens are starting to add up.
---
Same here. Five characters. Only one will make progress, unfortunately.
---
you speak the truth.
---
had a few times he went down really fast and had a few times where i got the respawn bug and i have no idea what happened. hah pretty miserable
---
No lets add it then when ppl like it and get used to it remove it!
---
It needs to be fixed, yes. It's so freaking annoying.
---
But will it get fixed? No.

---
Anyone know why it's PC only right now?
---
It's never worked that way.
---
Pretty sure I can do this under a minute if I really wanted to - with the right weapon and build.  People will complain either way - too long or too quick.  The whole event is just silly and pointless though - as many times as I've done Scorched Earth its still a better event IMO.
---
What Bethesda needed is a Project Paradise-like event before you get to the boss fight...  but that is too much content to expect from them to put into a new event.  Radiation Rumble is actually pretty good, if only it had a boss fight to cap it off too.
---
Leveling up is easy with Tasty Squirrel Stew.
---
This?! I can't understand how people complaining it takes to long to complete your dailies...but anyways don't forget Watoga for the robots. Bots everywhere
---
The main problem with the game is variety anyway.  
---
I don't see the point in playing an alt because I could literally just swap my perk cards around and play any play style that I wanted. I can go from a lockpicking genius to a master builder.  
---
This game doesn't even offer replayability in terms of being able to have unique players. The game definitely has 'correct' strategies to use. Why on earth are their only 2-3 viable legendary types? weapons that are the 'right' ones to use?   
---
Make it so before 50 you can play around a little bit with your perk cards but once you hit 50 you're get a warning saying that this is your last chance to change perks before hitting max level. Once you've hit max level THAT is your character. No more switching perks, if you want to have a different experience playing the game thens tart a new character.   
---
The problem is the story doesn't allow for that either. The world is too open but the story is far too linear to really allow for the different characters that we're use too. I wanted to experiment playing a Proto-Tribal like figure but what's the point? I could literally just get my BoS-type character and just swap perks around to eventually get a Tribal.  
---
That's going to be the issue with one wasteland. More Freedom but still very limited choice. Every playthrough will still feel the same and NO wastelanders doesn't count because your choice has absolutely no impact on what happens in the world.
---
😆
---
I don't do them now after completing the Legendary run as it is a complete waste of time, need something for players to achieve as it is getting very boring now
---
It has ranged effects........pointless.
---
If it does anything, it's really minor.  I do wish it was a legitimate mechanic though.  You could time the crippling of Earle's legs so that he's under the debris when it falls.
---
What?
---
Davenport just needs to hang in the garage. That extra load screen is a pain. Even moreso when you have to load in again to photograph Meg or Paige. I'm sure if the overseer was outside there would be some kind of issue.
---
Nah he must be a clone. Their pumping them out in an underground lab yet to be discovered.
---
Turrets have been glitchy for ages. Assuming they arent in fact damaged and simply need to be repaired, you will probably have to store and replace whatever they are sitting on. They should then show up under your stored items and you can put them back down then.
---
Yeah, that's wild. There's enough purchases for one profile, let alone multiple. lol
---
Can't do it well at low health - try mid health instead.  Power armor won't help you against acid, its worse.
---
Not exactly hard to kill that behemoth.
---
The leveling up takes the longest for me, the other stuff is no problem at all.
---
You're supposed to be grateful that Bethesda continues to find new ways to turn an hour's worth of content into 3 weeks worth of grinding. Thank the whales!
---
Because the owners running the show seeing value in a game doesn't mean it's automatically better for the customers actually playing and buying the game.  That's why it's a meaningless acknowledgement, because in this scenario, it doesn't actually mean anything positive.
---
If you're trying to prove that companies stick around something that's profitable, then yes, while that's usually the case, that means more to the producer of a product rather than the consumer. It's not something of benefit to me just by virtue of it continuing to make money.
---
I barely have time during the week to run the quest for the treasury notes and if I'm lucky a 2 or 3 legendary run daily's. I gain most of my points on the weekends. Itll be close but I might finish the season off. I've come to terms with the fact I might not get all the rewards I would like. I will not pay to complete the season.
---
Could be because some people don't think about all characters on their account and are trying to level up their level 400 main character every day.
---
I am the Mayor there, sorry, can't do that.
---
It can be too easy, too hard - definitely not as fun, and you can get killed and miss out on the event entirely too.  Basically its just typical Bethesda SNAFU, and totally FUBAR too!
---
&gt; All they need to do is come up with different numbers, the current numbers are arbitrary anyways. 
---
Its not always that simple. Larger numbers means more data to transmit/process for the server which means slower response. Even moving everyone from a 4 to 6 byte integer would be a large increase in data needed to be stored. The developers may lack the access necessary to even change what value is stored
---
&gt; You're just not willing to let yourself accept the most obvious case, which is that someone botched this 
---
I am a software engineer/developer. I know software engineers/developers. They dont do unnecessary work. Creating a new system is always plan C, where plan A is trying to avoid doing the work entirely and plan B is recycling old stuff
---
&gt; The current numbers are *hardly* perfect and I see exactly no reason they couldn't do a rebalance with different base numbers.  
---
This could absolutely be done, but theres no assurance that even the perfect balance of points per bullet across all ammo types wouldnt need decimals. This would also require an across the board rebalance of crafting costs for all ammo to compensate for any changes made in point balance.
---
&gt; The *engine*? Wtf, this has nothing to do with engine constraints, they've got this UI working on three separate currencies 
---
The game engine controls the data objects and how they are stored. These objects/variables then influence all other systems including the UI that is layered on top. The UI cannot display information that the engine does not save/store, to put it simply. If the devs cannot change a data type for instance, they may be SOL for ever trying to use a decimal value
---
&gt; I really don't care about this angle, I frequently defend Bethesda from uninformed and unfair criticism.  In this case, mine is neither. 
---
The software development process is highly technical and case/fact specific. Those of us without inside knowledge can only guess at the process. This guess that i presented here is based on some experience and on a review of how some variables are stored when looking at datamining. Creating a nested terminal UI is less work than changing how the vendor system works in the initial engine, so in my opinion it is the most likely answer. Simplest answer first and all that.
---
Doesn't any update bring colossal problems?
---
You honestly get quite a bit from regular challenges. They aren't obligated to supply us with infinite atoms.
---
Got to get that gold bullion!
---
Cranberry relish and the bobblehead I forget which one it is I believe it's leader. Canned beef stew if you can find it, it's easier to get out of a player vendor and doesn't spoil.
---
I want the both the weekly and DAILY challenges for Atoms to return. However, I have zero desire for a challenge that tells me to play one to two hours a day. In the old system, I could do the daily challenges in half an hour or less. And unlike the current system, skipping challenges had zero effect on anything else. If Bethesda wants me to play for one to two hours a day then they should give me good Fallout reasons to play the game, not Fallout-themed carnival rides and slot machines. The challenges should be a complete afterthought, not a primary experience.
---
Offload my scrip into the machine and visit the gold bullion exchange
---
You got an anal probe from the Flatwoods monster!
---
Go for his legs first and cripple them he'll have to stay one spot.
---
I'm probably doing this for a "mule" character and maybe to experiment with another perk build but I'll be missing a lot of ATOM shop items I really want for C.A.M.P. purposes. Even if I was willing to shell out the money (AGAIN) there's enough items that I'll have to wait to flow through again and I'm impatient 🤪
---
Personally I know a lot more people who would much rather play the game for that time then sit around. You can get a lot done in 7 hours of 76 so I think it would only be a few people who just sat waiting for the timer.
---
Try to cash in my scrip on all 5 toons. Dream about faster loading screens. Finish second characters exchange and times up.
---
1st and 2nd commend made me face palm hahaha damn, golden op missed
---
You can still go there and kill the bots as mayor without them turning hostile I do it everytime the challenge for bots comes up oh wait or was that sarcastic
---
People cry if you kill the queen or colosus in 30 second, people cry When in a server dont are any good player who complete the event for he.........
---
Did i say that?
---
I’m fairly new, what is this about card packs and legendary cards? How does all that work?
---
Been playing for a while now... Flatwood is rarely played.
---
Good to know thanks!
---
Kush
---
Scrip, for sure.  I’ve got such a huge backlog of legendaries that aren’t worth selling just taking up space in my stash
---
Only if they were dirtier bombs and targeted at an area housing a lot of stored nuclear waste and weapons (like what happened in the glowing sea, actually). Now if a few of the low-yield ICBM style nukes we are launching around Appalachia were sequentially launched at the Waste Disposal Site in the south of the Savage Divide, it would make the southern part of the Ash Heap and a small part of the Savage Divide and Cranberry bog essentially a glowing sea that would spawn radstorms moving north along the dried lakebed to Grafton Dam or ones that would kind of sit and settle like a noxious glowing fog (with a cool aurora upper strata) in the basin stretching from the Sparse Sundew Grove towards the Glassed Cavern.
---
With all the nukes we’ve thrown at Fissure Site Prime, I want an update to the area with really high radiation in the proximity and expanded area of no vegetation. It is a shame that any update showing a crater in the region would break the story for new players, but a persistent glowing fog and radioactive smog from the Glassed Cavern to the fissure site in the south of the Ash Heap would be more than justifiable with just a couple warning signs.
---
Delete the game
---
Not yet
---
I have a couple of improvements to your tips.
---
Regarding bots: Watoga is best for this. You can wail on the bots there with impunity (assuming you've done Mayor For a Day), and they never aggro on you or fight back, unlike Whitespring.
---
Regarding drinking booze: Do 'Tea Time' and drink all the tea that the event rewards you with, this counts as booze. Or if you don't mind chasing around after honey, do Sweetwater's daily at the same location, and you'll get the same alcoholic tea reward.
---
I’d probably just end up practicing my parkour skills on top of whitespring station to the tower next to it. Maybe Mothman emote on top if I still have time.
---
Which challenges?
---
I do believe it gives 4 star legendaries. The 4th perk being a new thing called “cursed” which buffs the weapon but it loses some durability. That’s what I’ve heard, I’m still waiting for it to release on console.
---
There is a couple that can use the 50 cal balls without mods.
---
美 (America) 帝 (empire) 必 (must) 敗 (lose).
---
If I launched the nuke I'll do what I damn please. If I didn't then I'll show manners and not instantly kill it.
---
Too spoiled by Morgantown. I hate flatwoods now.
---
Did you take the exams?, you need to do the whole list under one challenge, and complete the exam to earn the badge
---
Pre-war food: hit the trash cans at whitespring, always seems to be plenty. That or dog food.
---
I use the load card and only put on it when it's going to be withdrawn and if the company can't draw the money they automatically cancel the subscription.
---
For me the pre war food is the locked fridge in the diner/bar in Flatwoods. Like seven cans ready to roll. I always clean it out when I pass through raping the lead from the motel up the road.
---
Also if I'm not challenged I stay and do the Defend Workshop event which triggers like 30 seconds after taking it. Two birds one stone.
---
I only play a couple of hours a day if that, and i can normally get all but the NW challenge (as don't play that mode at moment) and maybe one normal one usually kill a legendary.
---
My main is a former BoS commando. Too old for this shit, too many battles. He just wants to hunt, fish and mind his own business.   
---
Also, he is your father. Ask your mom. Plot twist.
---
Have to be in a private team, then they do it just like they would in theirs
---
You have to he on a "regular" team, not a public team and they can only build and move and destroy what they build. If you as the camp owner move or place something they can no longer edit it. Also they can not build any atomic shop items even if you both own them.
---
Start a team (not a public team) and invite them to the team
---
You wanna be careful with this, because they might plop down one of those ammo factories and permanently ruin your build budget.
---
Chaotic neutral
---
I like Morgantown , to just jump in the water
---
I remember it like it was yesterday...
---
Wait, oh shit, wait wait wait. You are telling me, my medics Explosive minigun was magic?
---
Berry mentats most likely
---
Advantages? It’s just turning junk into scrap. “Oh I can junk shit where I’m standing and you have to go to a work bench, I’m so farther ahead!” 
---
What are you smoking?
---
I know they won't be hostile! But I want to be a good Mayor!
---
I’d love if the instanced interiors are made to be little bunkers like the Overseer has, with exposed cave walls. If there’s exposed walls, there’s a way to call Motherlode to drop us at other players’ camps, the Overseer’s house, Foundation, and Crater...
---
I never got to play at Flatwoods. Never
---
Hhhhh got it too. Sucks tho considering I had to fight off Mirelurk Kings twice with melee.
---
ok, i'll try that next time 👍
---
I started a new character this season just for the leveling up dailies
---
Yeah actually wtf is up with that 3 minutes loading time at the beginning of the mission too? That'd be a perfect time for a wave type defense before getting to earl
---
See if I got any free shit in the Atomic Shop, go back to the main menu, enjoy a bit of Inon Zur's theme and then log off.
---
fighting Earl we will start running away with scared emote. i kept running into hazards and dying
---
ABC: Always Be Contributing 
---
Meat Week prizes depend on a successful cookout, and that means everyone has to contribute as much as they can.
---
2076
---
To be fair, if a naked person wearing only a hood suddenly appeared near me I’d freak out too...
---
Not quite an ettiquete thing, but make sure to equip butchers bounty before harvesting your prime kills for extra prime cuts. More prime cuts to contribute means more scrip for you, and a better "meat cook" for everybody.
---
Nah, they want us to have more than one toon.  Else why would they have the daily leveling requirement on the SCORE?  Need to get from level 2 to 3 ONE MORE TIME.
---
So you have no interest in playing the game but want to get that Flux and play with dedicated players? Something doesn't add up
---
The definition of Advanatge “a condition or circumstance that puts one in a favorable or superior position.” 
---
Yes even something as stupid as that is an advantage. 
---
The full on advantage like the scrap box having unlimited space Vs the average player who has a limited amount of space. 
---
If you don’t know what an advantage it than you need to go back to school. Dumb ass.
---
Did you eat some berry mentats?
---
What are you paying for them?
---
Yup.  I was just letting you know my solution.
---
It gives you enough time to stim with a bit more health - which you must do anytime you notice your health dropping.  Watch what is around you and try to keep to a good safe spot away from the fire/barrels/etc.  Should make a huge difference in staying alive throughout the event.
---
I don't blame you for wanting to see it, the updates for in-game earnable camp stuff are basically nonexistent.
---
Go into the high school. If there isnt monster mash going on, it will have hostile bots even if you are mayor. Plus i noticed there is usually one legendary and on rare occasion, 2. Then a short hop to the forward base to kill a couple more and one robot there will be legendary with the possibility of a scoreched beast being legendary too, but not as common.
---
Haven’t personally experienced this. Assaultrons do more damage then most of the enemies in this game but I haven’t been getting one shot or had the no recharge head laser either (I’m on Xbox btw)
---
@O[akleyW23](https://www.reddit.com/user/OakleyW23/) What is it with people who play online games and this obsession with slot machines? NO DAMN RNG WHEEL!
---
Pretty much an OP mechanic that Bethesda ignores. Also the gusty OP armor piercing attack.
---
 What do people tend not to do? The gathering or drumming/spit?
---
wait, the fuck is their armor piercing attack
---
I saw a post a while ago saying bring the atoms daily challanges back and just keep the weekly for the legendary run and I feel like thats a good compromise. I was more than happy to buy atoms here and there to make up the difference for things I wanted. Now I feel like I'm being bluntly pushed to buy atoms (they're not even being subtle about it) so I refuse to.
---
Punch the Behemoth then dance on his corpse.
---
Mid September.
---
He glitched &amp; went under the ground but popped up later. I can’t imagine the bugginess of the event without the delay.
---
But to me, the event has been an 8/10 success rate of no bugs or problems.
---
Legacy Lasers have shit dps, they're just good at tagging!
---
If you have trouble finding other people for public events, defending your own workshop is an event and counts
---
If you would like I have 3k 50 you can Just have.
---
Ahhh that’s really good, missed it
---
Thank you for the tip, I was using the tinkerer bench next to the ferris wheel cause I couldn't make my own, I should have enough materials now.
---
so from what i'm reading it's like a glitch that has a chance of happening for people
---
Yes. Medics works
---
That's exactly what the issue was. My turrets reappeared once I stored the roof pieces they were on. They showed up under stored. I really appreciate the tip thank you
---
Hopefully it gets better for me and this doesn’t happen anymore, i think the server was overloaded
---
The Colonel Gutsy’s that shoot the assault rifles have had borderline OP armor piercing since launch i get two tapped by those things if i lose stealth 😂
---
.50 cal balls and .50 rounds are two entirely different ammo types, with different crafting recipes and different uses, including never being used in the same gun. What’s your point?
---
That’s super unfortunate. I couldn’t imagine trying to run &amp; dodge an infinite assaultron beam 😂
---
O.O
---
I think I’ve died more from assaultron head laser attacks than everything else combined.
---
Fixer plans are quite valuable, handmade plans can be bought at some vendors fro around 1500 caps
---
Little people I know play the game and I don't have fallout first sadly.
---
I can't remember if its all models or just the Colonel or Major Gutsy but they have an attack sounds like a "ka-thunk" sound. It feels like it ignores armor especially if its more than one.
---
I never claimed or implied that persistent games don't need any money to run. My point is that we have no idea how much of what the game takes in is spent on development, so acting like all the monetization that goes on with this game is just typical and necessary funding is misleading at best. It's become incredibly apparent in the last 10 years that big publishers using MTX are getting filthy rich.
---
So for all any of us know they are pocketing or redirecting 80% of the funds this game takes in. The best we can do is judge the actual development results, and although I don't hate this game or think it's bad, it's pretty clear to me that they have not improved the development much in almost two years, and the new earnable in-game rewards are largely nonexistent and often lackluster when they do show up.
---
At the end of the day, it's valid and good for the community to reject the horseshit argument that money asked of us becomes money spent for our benefit. 
---
It's better to keep a critical eye on microtransaction and subscription and season pass and compare that frequency of that to the frequency and quality of updates. And for a long time now the two have not kept pace.
---
Which fence?  The regular crappy looking fence, you can put spotlights on if you mess around with it enough.
---
THATS WHY THEYRE FUCKING BROKEN THEY JUST SPAM THE SHIT OUT OF THAT
---
Somehow we're flooded with commie shit but not a single Enclave item in sight past a Goddamned eyepatch - and Enclave are supposed to be /the/ end-game faction, too.
---
I think it’s unfair to compare this game to the stereotypical mmo. Their actions and words have made it clear time and time again that this is not the case. Just because it has mmo elements doesn’t mean it should be a full fledged mmo. That’s like saying they should do a massive overhaul with the combat, as it’s vaguely a FPS game
---
You could just start a new character, run to the wayward finish the quest there, and then do the make an armor and weapons and you've got your level up
---
Yeah even on my bloodied Power armor character with emergency protocols &amp; full T-65 those things will 3-5 shot me if I’m not paying attention 😂
---
No prob. Had the same issue myself at times. You are just lucky what you placed them on can be stored. If it was on something that would trigger the "inaccessible" bullshit then it becomes a total pain in the arse
---
Thanks more the help greatly appreciated
---
Sounds good to me.
---
I’ve had this happen with the nuka cola projection lights and collectron stations.    The latter I’ve only had happen in workshops, but still.
---
NW challenges, for those of you that brave them (all tips assume you’re playing Morgantown since it’s the popular map):
---
Kill a creature: Bolton Greens, but spawn to the left in the grounds. Almost always a mutant hound or two to murder. Look out for crossbows as they’re quiet(ish).
---
Pick a lock: the tower next to the train yards is relatively quiet at the start of the match and has a yellow box to pick.
---
Revive an ally: tricky, but if you have a friend with you drop off a cliff edge to down yourself. Rinse and repeat until complete.
---
If ure on PC can’t you just hotkey each item like stims n radaway without the need of a pipboy?
---
I feel called out on my daily grind lmaooo
---
I have like 300+ halloween candy i keep on deck specifically for these challenges lol
---
I appreciate it! Honestly I don’t use 50 frequently. I actually will just burn it because I hate people who craft the ammo and sell it at their vendors so even though I took it, I’m just burning threw it to get rid of. I will use the 10mm though lol
---
do you know about /r/fo76filthycasuals?  It's like this place, but less toxic.
---
what platform?
---
Fuck me dude, why, I scripped that
---
Username checks out.
---
Scorched beasts have the ability to control gravity after death.
---
It would be nice to be able to hotswap syringer loads.   Doesn’t really make sense to me that it’s a modification and not different ammo types
---
It is pretty good but you're aware there is much higher damage melee weapons?
---
It is considered underarmor. Sadly, it is not visible as soon as you put armor on
---
Mid september they say.  I am guessing September 15 since they like doing stuff on Tuesdays.
---
I dont want multipple characters, i want swapable builds, like they promised in roadmap. I dont think builds will have special redustribution as well as percs, but at least it something...
---
I love the idea of having mulltiple dramaticly different build (special and card), but not mulltiple chars.
---
Give us proper respecs, and bigger limits (stash too)
---
Great question.  I’m getting close to the same situation and I’d like to know what people have done.
---
pc already has a stimpack hotkey by default.. I just add radaway to favorites.. 
---
bam!.. covered
---
You out there doing Todd’s work.  Bless you, OP
---
Log on as many alts as possible and sell 1400 qty of ammo for 1 cap a piece to make my daily 7000 cap sell limit.
---
You can do what you like of course, but this was always a good way to do both fast. You also can't use a controller and keyboard at the same time, they cancel each other out.
---
May have some 10mm on me, xbox?
---
*it just works*
---
I don't really run dodge but I definitely agree people who run dodge probably get annihilated
---
Sit in the main menu for 10 min pondering my existence and eventually log on. Then proceed to finish watching my minecraft building tutorial video and realize time has been up for 5 min.
---
I mentioned they were favorited. You won't get that prompt if they're painted. If it wasn't painted I would have been able to pick it right back up off the ground.

Im a console guy, wasn’t sure myself. 
---
But I see.
---
"to justify your argument that 'Microtransactions should be free'"
---
lol I never claimed microtransactions should be free. You need to put some glasses on if that's what you took from what I wrote.
---
Games that want more money provide quality updates. That's all there is to it. This game consistently does not provide quality updates, not even the quality provided years ago in their older games (see Far Harbour), and it barely ever updates the in-game rewards. The reason for that is crystal clear when you see the weekly Tuesday ATX updates and tacked on shit like a sub model for a game that was critically panned, and now season pass rank purchases in place of in-game, gameplay earned atom rewards. They even dabbled toes into the stupid repair kits and continued to push them even when it became obvious that most of us were aware of the line they were attempting to cross, and had no interest in paying for gameplay advantages. 
---
"There's always a reward to get" is pretty much the lowest standard possible. Those rewards are largely two years old, power upgrades are largely useless because they still haven't implemented any genuinely challenging content or fleshed out endgame, and fun cosmetics (particularly camp cosmetics) are virtually nonexistent if you want something fresh... and all of that stuff is what most other online games provide to justify their MTX. 
---
In 76, MTX has become a stand-in for actual quality content updates. 
---
I think you're the one who's not getting the point of MTX. You seem to think they're universally about some kind of quality exchange where customer appeasement is a genuinely important factor. I suggest you take a look at Path of Exile, a ~free~ game with more consistent, higher quality updates that still has significantly less MTX than Fallout 76, and from a lesser known studio as well. xD
---
Usually everyone is going about helping. There's plenty to do.
---
Right, All I'm saying is that - Even if that money doesn't go toward development, it shows value in the product for Zenimax and keeps the game from being shut down for lack of profit. Depending on how things go it either has or could provide reason to bump up support and investment.   
---
Personally, I think it's already in motion. Having so many 'long term plans' touted by the team like Seasons, Expeditions, etc - Makes me genuinely think funding has increased following Wastelanders and the game's resurgence. Just common sense really.
---
Good luck out there! I'll keep the kettle on...
---
Are you using it in VATS?
---
Uhuh you bet from now on. It was just something I carried over from Fallout 4 and it never hurt me until now. I just wanted to warn anyone else who might operate the same way.
---
Picked up a integrating explosive lmg thats magic off the queen an hour ago
---
&gt;It means something to the consumer because the game continues to be updated and supported as it shows profit. Like you said - If value wasn't shown, the game would go under. New things get added, work is actively done to add to the game.   
---
That doesn't happen if the game isn't profitable. Meaning in short... A lack of profit means a lack of new free content for the consumer.
---
Oh my fuck yes...please Beth! Listen to this fine person!
---
Doubt
---
One day, my friend. One day.
---
I keep forgetting. Im on the PC.
---
Someone may have shot you with the vox syringer
---
What is the legendary effect? What mods did you apply? What perks are you using?
---
Where do you buy the other ones from?
---
Something about it being easier to push fixes on PC as opposed to consoles. PC is basically taking it for a test drive to find bugs before they push it to consoles.
---
Wait, i did tgis today and got scrip and tn from both. Wouldnt that be the reason to go back?
---
Try one of the other subs. This one doesn’t allow bartering.
---
Actually yes but I just logged out. Should be good for a while though, up to 10k
---
Oh no. I took the toy, and then refused to give it back to her.  Now she just stands there and yells "You monster!", and "Why would you take her toy?" and sometimes just cries.
---
She spawned at my camp.  Guess I'll be moving now.
---
dodgy?  Nah.  Well I run dodgy with Action boy and Kinetic dynamo.  I am a full health PA.  I can take their head beam for a full 6 seconds. lol I timed it once.  But i usually strafe left or right and get close so they switch to their blades. I can take two Assaultrons back to back no sweat.  Well a little sweat.

"Having so many 'long term plans' touted by the team like Seasons, Expeditions, etc - Makes me genuinely think funding has increased following Wastelanders and the game's resurgence."
---
Did you see the roadmap from last year? Did you notice how much of that roadmap was either garbage, removed from the game, or never showed up? And how has this year's roadmap been going so far? Lots of praised quality updates and fun new things earnable in-game, or a lot of mistakes, delayed stuff, rehashed events, and an almost absence of cool new earnables through gameplay?  xD
---
I will take your point about a game showing profit. I won't argue that profitability isn't important to keeping a game alive. But the game's many problems, particularly around the lack of quality updates while they keep shoving MTX, makes this a sick, diseased example of a game. And if this kind of thing is treated as normal-- games need to make money, this is fine-- then eventually you're going to see this kind of poison more and more. 
---
I've been watching it for 20 years.
---
O.  well i have about 40 but im PS4
---
Mods were the piercing clip, along with stabalized long barrel. I forget what else, but I was able to purchase every mod for it. I wasn't using any shotgun perks but again I still expected 2-3 shots to do the job on a pure vanilla setup for it.
---
However I did another test run with a stock set and no upgrades and got the same shitty result with the no reload glitch and all. The only viable roll on both was the +10% while aiming stat that seems to not do shit.
---
Tested with and without vats, both sucked.
---
hnng
---
I would consider your audio drivers as well. Or maybe a reboot?
---
There's a text chat in fo76?
---
I never realized Bashing was a thing.  I never use it.  But good to know that that method works as well.
---
ahh i see
---
Not sure what to tell you. My three can be a little glitchy but are pretty devastating against most non-boss mobs.
---
ahahaa oh :(
---
This is why I don’t use weapon paints
---
Thanks, didn't know that.
---
To add to this, handmade plans just let you build handmades. Learning the Fixer plan is essential to add fixers to your legendary loot table, otherwise they don’t drop
---
Np, I still have to see how much I have as i dont use 10mm much and i usually keep it in the vendor and dont really pay attention to what sells unless im restocking. 
---
Gt is narmyknight if you see me online, I almost always have an excess of ammo if you need it, I can usually craft it quick as resources are always on hand too.
---
Hit Sanctuary,  Turn in Ward Daily, exchange notes,  sell cap limit.
---
Makes sense with his conspiracy stuff.
---
The way I feed my .308 LMG is by converting all the 10mm, .44, .38 and other useless ammo types I don't use into points to convert into .308 rounds lol
---
Is there a specific quest the On have to get for the exams or do I just have get 5/5 on all of them
---
I'd've killed to be able to use Army Fatigues as an underarmour instead of the awful dirt-caked military fatigues that, for some inane reason, use casual lining of all things.
---
never hurt anything no? ok, so, what one do you recommend? For real here.
---
I've had someone follow me around for a while pointlessly shooting me, then fast travel to my camp and buy stuff. I guess I'll never know.
---
Plasma I agree with, but Fusion cores are a bit trickier, because you can take over a power plant workshop and literally print them out of the fusion core machine, albeit slowly.
---
That said, I still think it's a good idea, so long as the conversion rate's not so generous it's unbalanced.
---
It's not like the fusion core machines at workshops are really fast or anything.
---
100% yes.  I’d rather give a low level a bunch of metal, wood, concrete, glass, etc. (as well as a bunch of plans) so they can build their first CAMP and not have it look like a shotgun shack.
---
From now on!
---
I strongly believe this is lag related &amp; the server doesn't recieve the damage dealt by you.
---
If you do some outside downloading it'll be worse, but if you have fallout 1st &amp; join your private server its perfect even if you're downloading something.
---
I never do pvp (literally that was the first time I ever did it) and the dude just kept shooting me while I was crafting shit at my camp. I had no idea that could even be possible at such a low level without having perks and stuff
---
Please re-read what they said. They never complained about not being able to get the "pretty skins". 
---
Way to downplay the significance of the issue...
---
It break the sub’s rules which seems to trigger the mods. 
---
As far as recommendation, DM sent.
---
To my knowledge Nuka wild, nuka grape, nuka orange, nuka cranberry, nuka dark, nuka quantum, nuka cherry, &amp; nuka cola so 8
---
You can buy them from one of the vendor bots, I’d try white springs. They won’t carry both at the same time so you’ll have to buy one and then server hop to restock the vendor with the other one, you have to have the other variants before shielded will drop for any underarmor
---
I have 104 last time I checked lol
---
&gt;Find a vending machine. Buy three bullets, one at a time.
---
My biggest pet peeve
---
Thanks for your help

I already leave the game idle for a substantial portion of my playtime, either because I'm being bribed to play a game mode I don't care about and is geared so it rewards sitting in bushes (NW), or because the best way for me to make caps is to have my character sleeping in his camp while people visit my vendors.
---
weird question for anyone who has finished - do you have to claim all the prizes before you take the last step? I'm at 90 and haven't cashed some in yet (caps, scrip) because of the limits on the currency.
---
About Watoga: if you kill enough bots, they'll send a Gutsy death squad after you.
---
In reality if I only have five minutes I wouldn’t bother turning the game on.  However, to answer the question I would probably just check the atom shop.
---
&gt; Need to scrap junk to collect "x"? If "x" can be bulked, then bulk and scrap.
---
I knew you could buy bulk junk from a vendor and scrap that, but it never occurred to me to bulk it myself and scrap it...
---
Rules can be bent. But, I joined up.
---
You can take over a workshop that makes ammo (converted munitions factory) and you can still turn ammo into ammo points
---
When I was a lower level sometimes I was in the zone and really didn’t want help, in fact often, i wanted the challenges of the game.
---
Now in the end game, please, help
---
The mods here have no sense of humor. Just FYI.
---
Awesome thanks!  I never used 10mm until I got my 3 star. AA, vats enhanced, and I think limp damage. Actually pretty solid with drum mag. Like a Gatling just weighs 4 pounds
---
Crafting thorn and solar armor still
---
You use it to craft solar, thorn and strangler heart armor which were initially rewards for the vault raid but now can be bought with gold bullion.
---
That or cranberry relish, which is +10%. Cranberries (not diseased) from Aaronholt farm in the forest, gourds from your camp, boiled water are the ingredients.
---
Being well rested gives you another 10%, and you can get more from the inspirational perk if you're in a group.
---
I should've specified that I just started playing the game last month and have no idea what those are lol
---
you  know, I've gotten that shotgun but didn't realize it was anything special and scriped it, oh well only have so much space
---
There should at least be an incentive for doing the daily and weekly challenges after completing the season. I"ve been done for almost three weeks now and it's getting boring not having something to grind for.
---
Canned meat stew counts as pre-war food, even though you just made it.
---
Hahahaha. I messed up the first time I tried to give someone excess ammo I had (5.56 and .45) and I forgot about the emote wheel (I was level 60 something) so I shot at the ground so in my mind they turn to me and be like WTF are they doing. In reality they booked it and I followed and then they left the server. Hahahaha.
---
Private servers, no.  Servers cost money.  But local play on our own equipment would have been good.
---
Id press the PS button, quit game and load up FO4, since big "B" wont fix there broken 76 game...and every update seems to just ruin any enjoyment I did have with it... im not gonna spport lazy devs, that basically used the dedicated moders from FO4 to make 76, its so obvious!
---
The only way I've found to make that gun worthwhile is to use it in the third person, charge first, then VATS, and fire. Otherwise, it's like you're throwing a wet paper towel at your enemies. It seemed really inconsistent to me for a long time. I still think it needs some work. But, since I just use it in third person and I charge my shots and rely on VATS, it's a lot better.
---
Theres a pond but it has a mirelurk queen spawn is that where it is
---
Gosh darn it. Just went through a nuke silo and now I gotta nuke the queen.. again.
---
WOW
---
\[M.O.D.U.S. upon being asked whether or not the prospect of using the weapons that destroyed the world was unnerving to them\]
---
"...No."
---
I'm starting to find that people are slowly not stocking ammo anymore.  Or at least less of it.
---
I at least buy a bulk on the last one if I can afford and or use the ammo.  And its reasonably priced of course.
---
Is it out for consoles yet
---
Lol you on Xbox, if so I'm in
---
The damage vat shotguns do is great but from my understanding, the shotguns VATS shots are *not* a *magic* effect, its simply doing what it is designed to do: every pellet from the shotgun using VATS hits its target instead of it being sprayed(poor accuracy) without VATS.
---
But people believe it is magic because it deals significant amount of damage compared to not using using vats.
---
The LMG *magic* effects are real, but only if you do not miss.
---
I use my gatling gun most often, so am always making bulk 5mm. I usually keep 20k on me just in case. Lol
---
I’m ok with one character knowing everything, as it makes you really think about what your gonna do. Which is why I’m waiting to use the level ups I have with regards to the cards. 
---
What I really am looking forward to is the card layouts. God how much I want to simply click a “title” like building and have them replace my building/camp cards instead of having to do it manually. 
---
I do think the legendary run should be across characters though. And would like to see more stuff that is not weapon/armor added for bullion for those of us who don’t care about them, as I have 500+ treasury notes sitting in my inventory to avoid loosing any to the 5,000 limit. 
---
No matter what happens not everyone is going to be happy and that’s okay with me. I have not enjoyed every change they made but it is a game, not my own creation, and such is life.
---
For the "level up" one-  make a new character.  Run straight to the overseer's camp. Grab the mats from the red toolbox and craft a board  and leather chest armor.  Run inside the wayward and kill the raider.  Talk to the lady, just keep mashing X until she's done talking. Bingo  you're done. Delete the character and repeat as needed. Takes about 5  min tops.
---
Oh, makes sense. Thank you
---
Honestly, don't worry about it till later.
---
Cat mum FTW! I've got 3 rescue fur babies myself. One is a part marine coon ginger ninja so I guess that's my flaming fluff ball haha.

I'm from Australia so even though we are kind of part of the British government, I don't think any of us would recognise royalty even if they rocked up to a Bunnings Sausage Sizzle. Hence why only the British and the well read pick up on it lol.

This is literally the first post I've ever made on reddit so the name that I chose like a month ago really caught me off guard
---
NO MORE CIRCLE BASES?!?!?!??!?!?!?! THAT WAS A THING AND I MISSED IT?!?!?!!!!
---
I’m so glad I just finished this yesterday. Not having to worry about xp for a month is very refreshing
---
How?
---
It’s all in the gear. There’s a glitched level 5 laser out there that will do a pretty good number on unsuspecting people. Even a low level bloodied or junkies handmade will wreck if you can free aim. When I was leveling up my new toon, I had a low level bffr handmade and a half assed set of level 15 sentinels armor. I was surprised how many people I was able to kill. I’ve got a clip somewhere of me gunning down a 292 while I was at level 19 😆.
---
In general I’d like to see more decorative stuff that is post apocalyptic rather than teenage boy bedroom
---
He can be a bit hard to target, and it's slower deleting him if you miss a lot.  With a clear target, a minute would be easy.
---
I played safe the first few times and just plinked at him with a vampire's gun, but most people don't do enough (normal) damage to make a dent, not to mention the sub-50 people that are in there frequently.  I've gotten to the point where I just finish him off if there hasn't been enough progress after a few minutes.
---
Really? Ha! I actually got a Mutant's Two-Shot Ultracite gatling laser drop for me today. I'll try using that next time
---
You used to be able to no problem.
---
I could give that a try
---
Active ward mission, get gold from foundation, fast travel to glitched ward pieces, pick them up, go to smiley. Done
---
YES.  I had a full roster of alts when I used to play WoW.  Now, people keep talking about alts in FO76 and every time I think to myself, "what is the point though?"  The whole game seems to just be actively hostile to that way of playing for some obscure reason.
---
If you want to be picky, you could maybe include Nukashine.
---
There are also the 3 variants you choose from when making the vaccine, which are:
---
Nuka-Cola Vaccinated  
---
Nuka Cola Scortched  
---
Nuka-Cola My Blood's In It
---
I’d hold off on any big purchases until the next patch, save for maybe a backpack or two. Currently on the PTR they’ve expanded the purchasable items a bit with bullion, and one of those items is the lunchboxes from the current season, at 3 lunchboxes for 100 gold bullion. 
---
The reason this is important is because experience gain will be even more important next season then it is now, with the introduction of legendary perks. Leveling up will require lots of experience points and I’d go for those lunchboxes before any of the Rng centric offerings like SS armor, weapons, etc.
---
Just my 2c.
---
😂 yes!   Like would you like some more posters and lamps?
---
In one of her holotapes she does say "If you are listening to this then I'm dead" but I always took her as a sensible girl and that if the scorched plague shit hit the fan then she would leave WV like everyone else did. If she is still alive then she just might not have had time to record another holotape.
---
It's simple, just don't require medication. /s
---
With most events afkers are shitheads because they do no work and get the rewards piggybacking on everyone else but in meat week, they’re only shitheads if they’re not turning the meat or playing drums
---
Not rare, just the voting seems to go Morgantown a lot more. I played when it was just flatwoods and had fun. Nowadays my group and I joke when we do get flatwoods and say new map who dis?
---
That's way too low of a price. 2 and a half times that is fair.
---
Pretty sure, and I've seen it drop from mobs or events (can't reacall which exactly, but probably can from both).  Once you know the plans.
---
I got a decent Gauss Shotty from one as well, I learned the plan a while back but never made one.  Now I don't have to!
---
they can but you would be better buying legendary modules and crafting them - remember all the different types of armor you might roll from mumbles, it is a low chance to get SS but you would always get when you craft, plus you can pick  what piece you are working on.
---
ETA I would get the after fasnacht parades so anything that has that pool can drop
---
Would you say the Chemist backpack is worth it? Would it let me take the traveling pharmacy perk off and get some other strength perks?
---
Yeah that the move I make. I love messing with the outputs
---
Sentinel is useless while sneaking, just fyi.  Not saying don't go for it but don't stress about not having it.
---
That's me. Most of the time I'm idle sitting in my camp on a chair waiting for my shit to sell. I want to play but there's no point.
---
You're 10 hrs too late
---
If you must go AFK, do so on the instruments or the grills. Doing those allow you to contribute. Even if you don't go AFK, if you see too many players doing other things and few people playing the drums or cooking, then it might help to do them. It's best when every one of them is occupied by a player, leaving everybody else to do the other objectives.
---
Still. The base damage of a pickaxe near 950 (must be a melee build) and the sneak attack damage. That's quite a bit
---
Y'all are sensible.
---
They want to iron out any last minute bugs before pushing the update to consoles.  Apparently it's rather expensive so they don't want to have to go back and push out additional updates if they don't need to.
---
Oh! It’s a scout armor variant! It offers some special abilities when the full set is complete
---
It can already be killed in no time, doesn't take anything cheesy other than using the right equipment.
---
Set them at 30, 40, or 50 caps for full, I can’t keep them stocked in my vendor
---
I heard maybe MAYBE close to the weekend. Who knows really
---
Why not? They don't cost much at all.
---
I don't need to use any perks for mine to make the magic.
---
It's an AA 50 limb 90rw minigun with an accelerated barrel.
---
I'm a stealth pistol build and even without switching to my heavy/pa perks, the minigun does the trick, just takes some sustained fire before it kicks in. Took me about 3-4sec to kill a sheepsquatch in the wild with just the mg.
---
September 8th at noon will be exactly ten weeks from the starting time.
---
It’s not bad that they try to make shareholders richer, that’s their job. The bad thing is that their current model both reduces profits (think of how many lost sales FO76 got because of its shitty rollout) and delivers bad games. It’s a lose-lose for everyone.
---
Not saying it's a bad weapon just that the behemoth is a bad metric.
---
I feel you bro. Get some excavator armor and head over to the Lucky Hole. Don't forget to stock up on acid. Or the much slower grind of going to all the gyms throughout Appalachia. I really do suggest going the Lucky Hole route though. Will net higher gains much faster.
---
Sheepsquatch has the horn, skull, and quill if that’s something you would be into.
---
Gold
---
&gt;If you're like me you might leave your pip boy set to the stat menu when you close it so that you can quickly open it to take a radaway and stimpack together. It's just convenient. 
---
You lost me after this, lol. Hotwheel all day, baby. Sorry to hear about your item.
---
Did they give you any cosmetics? I always try to give new players something cool to wear since so many other people always seem to have gear and aid items covered!
---
Yeah, I just always feel a little guilty that I’m doing, quite literally, one of the 2 or 3 easiest events available in the game as a level 80-whatever.  
---
I do like showing showing up to Leader of the Pack, seeing a low-level struggling with the wolves, and picking off the non-legendaries/softening up the legendaries so they don’t die and miss getting the quest completion.
---
EDIT: My personal favorite fast burn event is where you have to kill that escaped Super Mutant convict at Grafton Dam.  I can wrap that one up in probably 5 minutes, including fast traveling there and back.
---
I play primarily in first person, its just easy to pick up items. I like 3rd person for the FOV though so i tend to switch but usually just stay first person as its easier lol
---
The Responders definitely are going to be the next faction to get content. They seem to be Bethesda’s “flagship faction” for this game (other than the BoS but that’s their cash cow for the whole series) and we’ve already seen them get new members from the settlers who have taken up the mantle of responders. We’re definitely going to be seeing more from them in the future.
---
As per the Free States and OoM I think it’s wishful thinking. Neither group has a very large fanbase (especially the former as their only faction items are locked behind a fucking paywall and they have no noticeable benefit to the player by doing their quests and only two events to do, both being quite pointless and uninspired)
---
It really is a shame though. I found the Responders to be quite boring and mundane, but thought the whole idea of the Free States and an Anarcho-Individualist movement to uncover government corruption and survive the wilderness to be quite creative and clever. If only we saw more emphasis on them.
---
TL;DR Responders most likely will be next faction to get quest content because of Bethesda teasing stuff with settlers cosplaying as them. Enclave probs will because they’re the second-most beloved group. Free States and OoM are probably lost causes when it comes to hoping for content. We might get some more holotapes that connects them to new happenings like we did with Blackwell being involved with Stabo trying to uncover Vault 79 but other than that, probably won’t see them return in the flesh
---
We haven't even gotten the $60 worth of a game yet and it's 2 years in.
---
Super annoying when you die at the wrong time so deleting him after a bit is a good move, gives everyone a chance then its goodbye Earle!
---
The problem is none of that is inherently a positive.  If a game gets 'support', that's only beneficial if the content is desirable and timely.  
---
If the game gets updates, but that content in those updates is underwhelming and shows a continual lack of understanding and action from the developers, then that's not a benefit to me, especially if the developers are also making pushes in their design to try and encourage more people to buy into microtransactions, which is what has been happening more.
---
Games getting more support is only desirable if the end result is an improvement.  In our current situation, Bethesda has made numerous pushes to try and make more money, both with Fallout 1st, and reducing Atom gains. While the game has continued to be supported, the game still suffers in numerous areas, there are multiple complaints with the way certain content is gated, and we have some major quality assurance issues with certain content that would imply the development team does minimal testing, or even playtesting their own game.
---
At a certain point, the issue isn't the risk of a lack of support due to the game not being profitable.  It's going to be the team behind it.  You can only throw so much money at something to keep it running, but that's never a guarantee the end-result is going to be beneficial to the consumer, they need to make something people they like, otherwise people aren't going to be grateful just because it's on life support sticking around.
---
Well shoot, I think I might just do that today lol.
---
Awkward..
---
Yep, 1 sbq done quick then 3 more needed to farm up the crimson to refill it if youre using prime
---
We have healers, the problem is a lack of controllable aggro for tanking!
---
Oh, the Prison Gutsies aren’t even close to the same league as the Watoga ones.
---
Here, I didn’t even know you could tame the Watoga bots with that Mayor quest I’ve been putting off.  Need to do that tomorrow...
---
It does. Yes
---
Traded 2500 flux for a weapon a few weeks ago so I'm good for a bit
---
He was probably trying to buy all of your items so he pushes you over max caps, and prevents you from gaining anymore profit. It doesn't seem to have worked, so enjoy your newfound wealth.
---
 Nuka-Cola My Blood's In It ***is the best*** cause my blood's in it.
---
Funding isn't directly coupled to consumers. Apparently the game lacked funding before, during and after launch, which is why we still have this buggy mess of game with less content than FO3.
---
Not sure I've died there yet, a vampire FFR mini pretty much gets you through anything.  I *have* come close a few times when I waited too long to delete Earle and got absolutely swamped with wendigos that no one was killing.  But I have heard the stories.
---
I want the whole Alphabet from you now.
---
Most of the Red Rockets have enough laying around to complete that daily.
---
each silo is like 3 hours, been since dec 2019 for sure. Maybe launch.
---
Nah I doubt that was the case. It was a few thousand caps worth but not like buying multiple 5k+ things. I think it was just a strange dude.
---
Fair and I wasn't saying it's good, just impressed with a pickaxe getting that high of damage
---
Yeah, I used to love this game but now I’m
---
In the same boat. Get on to grind for an hour and quit. I think after this season I may take a permanent break. Just too many grinds, laggy servers, and boring content to keep me going. I bought a year of FO 1st but  Bethesda has soaked all of the fun from the game with the endless multitude of grinds.
---
guess I never launched back to back
---
[Unofficially](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151/) (highly recommend it though, its awesome).
---
But...why?
---
I have one character and that's enough.
---
Who has time to play 10 characters?
---
I understand destiny having 3 characters but I really don't see the point in fallout.
---
Does your camp see frequent attacks from enemies? Attacks on mine are so rare that I tend to forget it happens. 
---
But I imagine the enemies that spawn to attack your camp will scale to your level as well.
---
The Flatwoods monster puts out a purple haze that makes everything hostel. Happened to me once near the whitesprings bunker
---
Nukes and dragons doesn't support the changes to the perks yet it seems, but here's screenshots of my setup including the legendary cards.
---
https://imgur.com/a/xbPzbSQ
---
I don't do melee at all, so radicool is just there for the carry weight benefit. For events where I'm getting mauled I swap it out for rank one cola nut to help boost the healing from those.
---
Also relevant to this is my armor which is a full unyielding set with 378 DR 25 PR 354 ER and 55 RR including the armored backpack, and one piece is sentinels.
---
The only thing that sucks is before this I was perked to run heavy guns, explosives, and commando.. and to gain enough power back I had to pretty much fully specialize in commando weapons.
---
Make sure that you're at least 20% VATS chance and there's not a blade of grass between you and your target, the thing is touchy seems like. I can sometimes make great shots with it at 12-13% VATS chance sometimes, but it's a trick to get it to hit like a truck every time. It is my weapon of choice at Radiation Rumble, couple it with Glow Sight and The Enforcer perk and you'll mop up some ghouls.
---
I think the horn is the most recognizable. Thanks!
---
Not a bad idea
---
Need to breathe?
---
Expand diaphragm muscles, take in air and then release!  
---
I had to make the joke, I know you mean well but at this stage I think most people have figured this out. The problem people seem to have is the repetitive nature of it and not the time itself.   
---
I can get everything done in maybe 40 minutes and hour usually not to mention hoping for events to start in order to beat some requirements isn't always practical. I tend to go to known spots where I have seen Legendary enemies in the past to clear it out asap.
---
I mean we paid for the game therefore it isn't free story content. Warfare is a completely F2P game that gives many hours of story. Not only does it give story but premium currency is tradeable and possible for F2P to get their hands on.
---
Edit: I do disagree with his time based challenge though.
---
I’m at max stash capacity and player carry weight 😑
---
It does though
---
I have way too many legendary heavy weapons lol
---
Mothman drops his wing but it can't be displayed, which irritates me to no end...
---
Same here. I don't understand why they dont just bump the stash weight to 1k
---
It happens a lot with a low health build - and when you're not using your vampire's weapon.  Guess that's what I guess for being thrifty on ammo and letting Earle live a bit longer.
---
These are max level Gutsy bots, and more of them. Those armor piercing weapons can get you if you aren't watching out.
---
You have to really go on a Watoga rampage to trigger them.
---
It ***never*** did that.
---
I'm not about to waste 3x as much ammo on a poorly designed bullet sponge boss just so you can farm screws. 
---
What do you need screws so badly for? Running queen events gives plenty of repair kits
---
Run a different silo, each silo also has a cool down period in your character just like the in world cool down time.
---
If not the vender style UI then base it on the UI of the reward machine at Lode Baring. IE: 157 10mm rounds detected, Would you like to trade 150 rounds for x ammo points. 
---
If they did that I would actually use it.
---
Excellent idea!  But they won't because then much more work would have to be put into each piece.
---
I believe that would work like “I grinded my way into obtaining the .50 cal receiver plan and now I get to use improved bullets because I earned it with my effort”
---
Chemist backpack is really good it it’s use fully depends on how many Chems you carry, same as the perk. If you only have a normal 60 carry weight backpack right now then it’s a good purchase as you can grab different STR perks in its place. :)
---
For reference, each of those backpacks is the max level of their relevant perk in terms of effectiveness, so the chemist backpack is equivalent to 3 ranks of traveling pharmacy.
---
But it could fly in this game. It did for quite some time. Not everyone grinded for the atoms but just having the choice made it awesome. Removing that choice shows their true colors. If someone truly wanted to show support then buying atoms isn't the only way to do so.
---
3 hours per silo on one server. So drop 3 nukes, move to another server, drop 3 more (if there is no cooldown on new server), move to another server, repeat process.
---
Make another character to use as a mule 😃
---
Your bot using any damage perks?
---
But the base game with extensions still has less content and more bugs than the other installments?
---
No, it doesn't. At least not for me.
---
Yeah swappable builds is good but not a replacement for different characters as the builds all have to have the same SPECIAL stats.
---
I should think before I post random thoughts...I have one lmao 😂
---
This would be so much better than using screenshots that also feature items not currently for sale, like they so often do.
---
Thank you for this!!  Been playing since day one, this ideal never occurred to me.
---
Same point as it is in Destiny. Trying new things.
---
If you look back in hindsight, you are given the Tinkerer and Chemist workbenches really early. It's a hint you should make those asap. Most ammo needs Gunpowder which you make at one and ammo at the Tinkerer. You can use any armor you find but weapons of all kinds need repair and upgrading. IMO, the Weapons workbench should be priority as well.
---
You use what?
---
I've tested turrets in the PTS, results:
---
* Machine gun turrets: Eh.
---
* Heavy machine gun turrets: Excellent.
---
* Missile turrets: Pointless.
---
* Laser turrets: Eh.
---
* Shotgun turrets: More like shitgun turrets.
---
Just make sure to give your turrets cover so enemies can't just walk up to them and smash them to bits, and you should be fine.
---
Or do like me and find a campsite where there are no enemy spawns.
---
Great shots! How difficult is the event to solo? I haven’t really played since finishing wastelanders just before the big dupe glitch but been getting very intrigued lately
---
The perks make or break weapons and builds unfortunately. You need them. Maybe when one wasteland comes out you can experiment more, but it wont change that you need the weapon perks. On another note I switched off of shutguns around patch 20 for the reasons you specify and I was going full meta damage. They just don't work that well imo, unfortunately.
---
I'll get my 150 scrip, turn in 20 notes, check a couple player vendors, do a quick lead run, oh look Uranium Fever, I'll just do that real quick...*five hours later* ...shit.
---
See that sounds like a good idea but the UI on the converter is much of a PITA that I don’t find it worth the time I have to invest standing at the ammo converter. But if it works for some people, great. I’m sure there’s things I dint mind or even like in the game that others hate with a passion.
---
To make you server hop an insane amount of times
---
That was what I wondered.  Either their sales would rocket or tank.  Heh.
---
[](/bloomjackwall)Can't speak for op, but every single time someone enters the Savage Divide my base spawns 3-7 lvl 60 enemies. I go through 3 tamed Deathclaws a week now just to be able to leave for extended periods of time.  
---
  
---
It is pretty fantastic for loot tho, I find more legendaries while loitering at my camp then anywhere else in the map. Which causes me to have more legendary gear in the vendor, which makes more people arrive to spawn yet more enemies!  
---
Fallout 76 is my favorite tower defense minigame.
---
You unironically want aimbot in PvP?
---
Same with the bones. They looks great
---
Ah yeah, with a bloodied build there are a few things that can insta-kill you, so it may not be totally feasible. I run junkie's, hence the delete ability, and the tankiness.  Perfect for this event!
---
There’s still no update on the main menu talking about maintenance for consoles. On Monday night, the menu said it was shutting down the servers on pc for maintenance. So my guess is we aren’t getting it tomorrow
---
I am in the same boat as you. I have great characters, well equipped and whether nerfing damage, removing atom challenges, legendary perks. A lot of these changes feel designed to drive me from the game.  It is sad, I have enjoyed a lot of things in this game but it seems to be going down a path I cannot follow.
---
No, but I don't think two shoting is an unreasonable thought with a vanilla build. I mean I spent so much time getting it that I guess I expected it to just be good on it's own.
---
Jeez.  What even is ideal for high radiation fluid these days?
---
Whitesprings on a private server and keep leaving &amp; rejoining to respawn them?
---
For some reason I found like 4-5 scorchbeast bones laying on the ground in a pile once and it looked awesome. If you really want to be disappointed put a strangler bloom in a display case sometime. It looks SO freaking cool but will turn into spoiled veggies. :\
---
Those cards are how damage works in this game.  Like bitching about a BE fixer with full health.
---
I came across a CAMP that has 17 Fusion Cores for 1 cap a piece.  I bought them all, then I realized, wrong character.
---
The whole legendary run thing has made me turn into a hybrid Junkie’s + Unyielding!
---
If the modders had a stab at it, it would actually play a lot better. Some talented people out there who do it for nothing but the fun.
---
the repair bill will be the same regardless. just turn on contractor and the problem is solved. Camp attacks have never been a big thing.
---
Yeah as a sneak commando pa is hard to use as it's well, power armour.
---
It takes me 25 minutes or so to level up at my farming spots at 320~ wish they added a limit soon. Players doing the score challenge is gonna take longer and longer.
---
It’s also not helping due to how much we have to farm for legendary coins they plan on putting out since each level takes longer and longer.
---
oh so you're one of the virgins down-voting everything
---
I see. I guess I've never been on enough of a rampage. I usually stop once I meet the daily requirement.
---
I guess the devs had to put something in place to stop the passive bots from being farmed.
---
Don't feel bad, honestly. Not at all. Medics isn't working anymore, and is absolute garbage on heavy guns anyways. 
---
Get yourself a magic medic shotgun and you'll feel way better.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous.  I wonder if creating a new character and the level up you get before you leave the vault would work
---
Shouldn't the title of this thread be face to face to face to face??
---
Yea that works but I think the dude was a duper, also traded a instigating explsoive ap reduced railway for 5k cobalt and violet
---
"*you are over encumbered and cannot run*" uh oh
---
It does not. But level 2-3 does.
---
That looks a lot like T-45, where the trailer had T-51.
---
Still really well done and cool though. :)
---
VATS really has no place in PvP.
---
I thought it was a bug when I saw someone buy three of my bullets. Now it makes sense.
---
OP: We shouldn't just nuke random shit, thats evil
---
Riflegaming: wha?
---
Fair enough, I was surprised too.
---
Easy solution. Start a new character, get the quest to go to the wayward, talk to the bartender, walk outside and craft something cheap and easy- boom level 2 with the score achievement. Takes maybe 10 min tops
---
Figured it wouldn't
---
It doesn't.  You have to run to the Wayward and talk to Duchess to level up, about 10 minutes with a new character.
---
…while floating in the air, stuck halfway through a wall.
---
I don't play too often and I go on just to see the store but I would usually play a little bit and actually get atoms. I'm noticing how bad the legendary race dailies are effecting my atoms. I'm not able to buy many things now :(
---
Are perk coins not shared account wide? Aren’t legendary perks account wide and shared on all characters? I’m not understanding this argument?
---
I agree that if the game was better (got more love from its owners) it would justify the current pursuit of profit. Unfortunately, offering low quality with many pricetags is just about the worst thing that can be done by someone in legitimate business.
---
You should come to mine, I always stock bullets for 1 cap no matter the type and I keep myself stocked thanks to the collectron.
---
Don’t think so. I did, but you can still access the board and everything so you should be good
---
Hm, I'm in the divide and very occasionally get a vengeful mothman but that's all
---
It does feel more and more unsustainable. To the point that it invites exploitation by create a new character to handle just the levelling part.
---
I pray, one waste land, fix this. Not only easiest events, but loot is low lvl, an you kinda robbing newbs, tho tbh, Wolf horde, always hoarded by vets who doing daily etc
---
I didn't think bethesda would allow it but ok
---
&gt; every time I level I need more exp to the next level.
---
They're gonna need to change this and put a cap on it, especially with the addition of the perk coins system. Otherwise they're unfairly punishing their longest-term players.
---
How’d you get the 50 cal plan for it?  Still waiting.
---
Lol nice
---
The point of ammo is to use it. I hate seeing people complain they have to use a couple of bullets when they are carrying around 20k of that type of ammo.
---
Using magic weapons is not a solution but a clutch to a problem that you need a to adjust your build better.
---
Well I haven't been downvoting you but, since we are insulting people now.  Here a downvote for you!
---
Fyi I wasted my atoms again. You CANNOT put mounted heads on these signs
---
Nah you don't really need to use it. Excavator armor has a bonus that let's you get 4x the amount of ore from deposits. So you walk through this cave once and end up with 2,000-4,000 lead. Then you don't have to worry for a while. Come back whenever you need more.
---
I think it's time to come to terms that this is just Bethesda. It's not going to get much better than this.
---
Todd is watching you.
---
Currently, they aren't. Only the unlocked slots are, but not the cards themselves.
---
&gt;2,000-4,000 lead
---
That isnt helping your argument that you dont need the excavator pa lol.
---
No, I completely disagree with this idea. The whole thought of being even more forced to log in daily to complete this crap is horrible. I don't know why you guys would want Bethesda to continue with the grinding.
---
The point of ammo is to use it to kill, not to fire thousands of rounds into a creature over 10 minutes and hope it dies. 
---
You're on PS4 so you'll learn when you can do a CP just how easy it is to burn through 20k rounds when you can use up to 3k or more per run depending on how much dps you have to help you.
---
+1 hoping their devs arent just 5 holotapes and a random dead guy
---
I have that glitch, all I have to do is talk to him once a day and I automatically get rewarded for his quest.
---
we’ll see. I use a prime B Gatling gun that has 650 dmg non-chemed so I know I won’t have problems with ammo.
---
I'd be more than happy to take the plasma cores off your hands
---
Still works for the railway.
---
Deathclaw hands can’t either. Like. Really
---
You can get hundreds of Halloween candy by doing Monster Mash and each piece counts as pre-war food.
---
What's wrong with using something that's been in the game forever?
---
😞
---
Bring lots of wood
---
I know what you mean.
---
Why haven’t we been calling the best weapons and armor Todd tier this whole time?
---
For the “collect plants or fungi” go to Billings Homestead. There are over 50 razor grain there.
---
Wow.. I just bought it a second ago
---
I've had the most awkward strange online gaming moments in this game, i love it. No other online game comes close to the strangeness of the wastes.
---
I sell 100% full fusion cores for 38 caps. They still sit a few days before selling, clogging up my stash limit. But it’s as low as the lowest price I ever see, and if I wanted to throw them away I’d just drop them.
---
I still have hopes, when i was younger i dreamed about fallout mmo. It was when Fallout Tactics came out and i realise that my favourite universe could be much more than just play 1 and 2 again and again, it could even be online game and when world of warcraft set in a way a picture for modern mmo i kept dreaming more. But the idea that Bethesda delivered feels just out of things i would like to see. Its even more painfull thats its one and only Fallout mmo forever.
---
Don’t forget plushies
---
Need to kill bots?  Head to nuclear silo Alpha, Bravo, or Charlie.  Lots of robots that keep respawning. 
---
Need to kill cryptids?  Head to the Flooded Train Yard, east of Watoga.  Snallygasters count as cryptids and there are always several wandering around.
---
Need to kill mole miners?  Head to a Breach and Clear event in the Ash Heap.
---
Need to level?  Get the Well Rested (or Lover's Embrace) buff by sleeping in a bed.  Craft (and eat) Cranberry Relish to get another 10% buff.  Join an Event public team to get another buff. Then go do an event or three.  If none are up and running, claim a workshop and then defend it.
---
I’m level 281 on my secondary character. I level up 2-4 times a day. I’m always on a team and I use Inspirational at three stars. I make sure I get lover’s embrace/kindred spirits. I also have herbivore mutation and I have plenty of cranberry relish every hour. That alone gives me (15% + 5%+ 25%) 45% extra experience points. Then I normally on a build team which gives another 2% per party member (max 8%). If you play the number right, you will get plenty of levels and if you throw lunchboxes into the mix, you level up even faster. It isn’t hard to get levels, just make sure you do what you need to get every advantage you can.
---
Malone is the new Spartacus.
---
Yeah I always hit the instruments because everyone wants to chase stuff.
---
We can’t handle weapons with 16 times the detail yet.
---
Can confirm, if 8 people all bring magic weapons, Earl dies super quick.
---
Kinda funny that they add a new boss fight, but don't fix the magic weapon bug first. Because the new boss fight perfectly highlights the bug, better than anything else ever could.
---
Also people might actually buy stuff less the more they can inspect it
---
I agree, content updates haven't been great. They've been decidedly rubbish in fact. But I think the fact that they're allowed to even announce all this new shit down the theorhetical pipeline is a good sign. Even if it comes out terribly, it shows that they're not on unstable ground in terms of funding from big Papa Zenimax, they know they'll have the support to do these things even if they release totally ass backwards and broken.   
---
As for MTXs, it's weird. MTXs are easy compared to content and run on a completely different schedule. Hell, we're getting MTX items these days that were made like a year ago, it's really hard to quantify 'Hey, they're putting more effort into making MTX stuff than actual content' when MTX stuff is both musch easier to create and is partially just regurgitated stuff that never made it last year.
---
well... now you kind of have to tell the story....
---
You wont be the main dps most of the time then, and it will be long fight if you are
---
Sit in the loading screen, crash, and load again. I might have 30 seconds left to push start to check my dailies.
---
Come back 1 year later I’m sure they’ll be new stuff by then.
---
If your tired of playing it’s time to accept the fact and try some other games. 
---
You can always come back.
---
LoL. While I agree with you, your wish is a pipe dream. There are always idiots around that want to be the “best” and shoot everything in 1 sec.  Maybe some day they will grow a set of golf balls and let people just be. Till then, those of us that play by the rules must suffer through or find another server to enjoy the game.
---
Oh, I'll have to look that up. I don't hate the vines, but it would have been cool to be able to cover them.
---
There are brotherhood walls coming in season two, if I'm not mistaken
---
I am always surprised when I see posts wanting the old  challenge system back. I have over 1800 hours played and never completed a daily challenge and if I was very lucky I might complete a weekly challenge once a month if that, before the SCORE system. I earned more Atoms doing the Legendary Run than I did from launch day through the start of the Run. It may be  because the old challenge system wasn’t very accessible or understandable (at least for me). I played from launch and it was months before I ever saw the challenge list. I had assumed that earning Atoms was one of those things Beth promised but didn’t implement. And for me at least it seems like the new challenges are easier to understand what to do to complete them.  I’m finding that the daily challenges take maybe 30 minutes and the weekly (expect for leveling) take maybe an hour total. I never could get those done before SCORE. That being said I’d be open to earning Atoms with the challenges after SCORE was maxed out for the season. And as I said in a other post recently everyone plays different and enjoys different aspects of the game, I’m sure I like parts that other people absolutely hate. Hope people find the parts of the game that make it worth playing for them, like I have for myself.
---
That or let you have several build templates that you can swap between
---
A gate would be great too
---
Got it 😁
---
What else are you using atoms on? Why else would you complain about missing out on free ones? It's a gateway to free atom store content like skins and outfits. Hell, many, many streaming / Fallout personalities have already admitted such. Hell, people on this subreddit left and right have admitted that they'd grind the shit out of challenges so they didn't have to pay for a particular costume or camp item.  
---
Are you seriously going to tell me people just hoarded atoms off of challenges for the sake of having and that nobody ever used them to purchase anything off of the atom store for free?
---
I wouldn't mind a daily check in atom reward. Fortnite save the world (pve) does that for every 5 days or so days you log in you get 150 vbucks or higher your daily log in is.
---
And you can sustain that indefinitely? So a year from now you'll still be able to level 2-4x a day? When you are roughly level 1400?
---
It shows up every other day in the bog.
---
U mean come back 1 year later to catch up all 150 power armor skins i missed... no way! How could i miss that.
---
That is a good solution. Didn't think of that.
---
Though it feels like a tedious task in the long run.
---
In the early days of the game I wore the Hunter's Longcoat and one of the Atom Shop Cultist Cowls.
---
I was standing in the Forest Region and eating some pizza IRL. Then a camp spawned at me. I heard two voices from a pair of low-levels also in area chat and one of them screamed. He saw me through the window, in the brush. I actually startled him.
---
And people abused the fuck out of it. People would buy everything they wanted off of the atomic shop without putting any money down. A completely ass backwards method of microtransactions that Bethesda apparently finally figured out was shooting themselves in the foot.
---
I’ll come back to this comment once I have a chance to test it out. 
---
You’ll be surprised how strong and efficient the Gatling gun is if you ever used one.
---
New toon a day takes 5-7 min
---
No i dont think so, if it does no one has found it yet or at least posted about finding it
---
Imagine if you could Pain Train him into the drill.
---
Lol lol. Weapons that, just...work.
---

---
You can never foretell which content is going to be good and which is going to be bad. It shouldn't be that way, all content \*should\* be good, but that's besides the point we're making here - People still want content. Cutting off atom sales or giving out atoms freely isn't going to improve the content we get.   
---
Whereas you could make an argument that profit = investment = funding = better tools and workers available for development = better content. It's roundabout and probably not at all what's happening, but if we're scared of content being bad and therefore never support it, then 76 would be long, long dead.
---
I've just been making a new character and speed running down to the wayward. Takes about 5 mins and it's done. I used to do it on my main, but it got to be annoying grinding out for it each day lol
---
FOMO is a powerful thing :p
---
Once you get to Rank 100 on the season, the Daily and Weekly missions should switch from awarding SCORE to awarding Atoms like before. I bought about half of the pass the first day Rank Up was available and now I have daily missions that are completely useless to me.
---
Planted some tatos, carrots, and razorgrain in my camp to craft chally's feed (also stocked up on boiled water).
---
Does anyone know how close to the cookout site you are allowed to place your camp?
---
Edit: the camp restrictions around the cookout site are already in place, so you can just go as close as the game will let you.
---
Consumers buy into the game which shows profitability to the people offering the funding (Zenimax in this case). If 76 proves profitable, Zenimax is far more likely to divert funds to the game to improve it's draw.   
---
Nevermind the likely portion of sales that are funneled back into 76's development.
---
I never use .308 because I believe it's mostly pipe weapons but I could be wrong as for missiles is because I just weighing them down unloading them.
---
Not for Skyrim mate
---
thats Skyrim SE and F4
---
I typically make my own, as I can generally go through more than 20000 rounds a session if I'm going in or farming bosses.  I only buy it to make my dailies go away and be useful.  
---
For instance, a couple days ago I didnt buy ammo, I bought a j25 gatling gun for 10k and a j10 flamer for 3k.  These replaced my I gatling and F10 flamer respectively, and a single round of ammo rounds out my dailies.  I look for useful things before settling on ammo.
---
For day to day normal enemies, I use a gatling gun, and my ammo machine makes 5mm so I'm good there.  The rest of my guns are varied in usage, and ammo mileage varies.  I have 12 guns in my inventory at any given time, along with a host of ammo gear each.
---
Bethesda: What are plasma and fusion cores? We dont play the game.
---
complete rubbish. the overwhelming majority of "gamers" are casual normies who play it out of the box, not hardcore nerds who plan in advance what mods they will install
---
Also, again, i didnt mention SE at all.
---
so you think the 20+ million who bought these games all modded them before even starting to play?
---
k.
---
Absolutely
---
She had amnesia and woke up one day with instructions to leave the vault so she doesn't remember anything from her past life (I'm too lazy to make up a backstory so that's it)
---
because its a percentage of steam users who bought the game on/for steam...... so if you read again, which you probably wont because admitting you didnt grasp something is hard, of those who own the game ON THAT PLATFORM nearly a quarter didnt get 5 minutes in.
---
Skyrim sales for all platforms is over 30 mil, i didnt use that figure so you arent counted.
---
Truth
---
you cant win with this bunch
---
yep, and as i said, as percentage of STEAM users, 1/4 didnt make it past the opening scene in Skyrim, for example.
---
Played that mission earlier.
---
Nah. Bring them and use that shit on those wendigo fucks. Magic shotguns don't do shit in the new event boss. Just FYI.
---
I had no idea. Thanks.
---
Just because it was in the game from the start doesn't make it a good choice.
---
Last time I visited someone else's base, they had a level 91 Glowing Deathclaw wandering around 😁
---
3rd but if I can't pick something up or I'm looking for something specific I'll switch to 1st for the moment
---
I have a two shot, explosive, fully modded Gatling gun, also a furious explosive ffs. Even with a full heavy build it’s a bit messy, good guns but dps is very slow.
---
Wallpaper or walls?
---
Just happened to me as well and after I used the “future” skin....wish I’d known before I spent a couple hours on the camp...
---
VATS in pvp are you mental?
---
If you pvped before in survival mode long time ago not being cloaked was a death sentence.
---
Where are you camped and where is your camp device in relation to your building? Does graham come along your camp?
---
What does that have to do with vault steel?
---
I dont really think this is worth complaining about "bad" writing. Also, didn't the motherlode drill get destroyed in the vault heist, and the other is in the deep?
---
This is the only time I switch to 1st.  It’s usually when i kill someone and I’m trying to loot those shitty blue vault tec duffel bags with a microscopic hit box.
---
Well considering I main heavy guns and have a BE gatling, I use it a lot
---
Oh, sorry. I was replying to a different topic 😅
---
After doing some independent testing, Optimized Bracers do reduce the AP cost of bashing by, just rough eyeballing here, 15%
---
I was using: optimized bos t60 bracers vs no power arms, with a BoS Prime Furious Minigun.
---
I know. It’s silly. But like I said this morning, it’s all yours and then some when you come back. I forgot to ask; what game are you living on to?
---
Except you have a personal cooldown, so you can't do that solo, you need another person to drop the 3 nukes on a new server.
---
Could be just a bug though. I’ll have to see if it existed or if they fixed it or what.
---
Too bad. I really liked my blood red BE Handmade...
---
You forgot the sugar. But I do use the cranberry relish. Leveling up still takes me about an hour at 180+ though.
---
TS has no place there. That Resistance  would reduce that damage quite a bit.
---
What is your damage with the Gatling gun on its stats page?
---
MUCH cheaper and quicker to just do the quests though.  But if you start the last part of the raider's quests before completing the other settler's quests to get the suit, you can still save up enough golf to get the plans.
---
Hell no i would never win
---
Poor guy XD I'd be startled too and knowing me just firing blindly (blame FPS games for that lol firing a MIRV Fatman inside due a to jumpscare was a rollercoaster)
---
But if you missed looting the wendigo like I did, you miss out on a legendary.
---
What’s the dmg on its stats page? Not chemed up ofc
---
Load bearing is at least easy. You have plenty of time to run around and collect the ore veins (despite half of them NOT.FUCKING.WORKING)
---
Last time I visited someone else's base, they had a level 91 Glowing Deathclaw wandering around 😄
---
Most likely he does, it's built on route 64 at the junk pile. But I also had my camp at the junk pile in the ash heap, and no enemies spawned there at all. Regardless, every pet I tamed disappeared within a day.
---
Fallout 76 is, in and of itself, not necessarily a good chocie.
---
And yet it's there.
---
Im confused here, your saying they dont want us to have more then 1 character, but list the 2 positives that encourage us to have more then 1 character?  
---
Like levelling up is speedy for new characters, allowing us to get more cards faster that we can then scrap the useless ones to aid our legendary perks.  
---
And the one wasteland makes it a more balanced experience ao we can make a new character and still play with our friends who didnt want to make new ones
---
Honestly, that's probably a big part of the damage balancing and One Wasteland.  
---
In the current setup, if they put out anything new it renders older content worse than worthless.  
---
Imagine if the damage kept scaling on this semi-exponential curve and they released new gear on it anyway. Within a couple iterations you're going to wind up with weapons that all-but one-shot the Queen and just grease everything else besides. And yes, I am aware there are weapons right now that do that, but you don't build around the expectation of defective gear.  
---
Any new armor'll start to squeeze against the upper levels of the diminishing returns and eventually everything'll basically flatten, either vertically or horizontally.  
---
With the damage change to additive, the scaling is cleaner, more predictable, and easier to build around or against, so you can come out with a weapon that is just definitively better while not rendering the high tier threats an utter joke.  
---
With enemies autoscaling in level, you can build around that too, so maybe we go visit the Molemen and find King Moleman of the Molemen, Mole-ist Man in all the Land, and he's tough enough to be a legitimate fight, with his damage also scaled accordingly.  
---
There was something said in the QuakeCon interview that basically implied we're going to be getting new/better gear once the BoS are actually here, though the phrasing escapes me and it's late.  
---
We'll just have to wait and see.
---
Maggie's to the right when you walk through the front gate, over where the Power Armor stations are.
---
My camp device is right in the middle of the road and my buildings are on either side of it. The megasloth I have now has plenty of room to roam around.
---
Way too many people want to hunt the critters. Drums, gathering greens, turning spits, and cleaning up poop is always helpful.
---
By the power armor stands just outside of Ward's office.
---
What is the etiquette on this? 
---
It's definitely not OK with queenie, probably more acceptable with the ISS, so where do we stand with Earl?
---
Step1: punch murmerger 1min. step2: punch ward 1min. step3: grab drill and masacar my kind: reproaches 3mins.
---
That makes sense. Thank you for the info.
---
I've got an idea. Remember that personal terminal they gave us? Set all the Wastelanders dailies on it. And not -Go talk to Ward. Like skip talking to the quest giver and use the terminal. Cuts a lot of fast travel.
---
Radroaches*
---
Lmaoooooo
---
Oh, I thought it was per server. I haven't launched a nuke in forever. I hate running the silo.
---
Again as I said with the other guy I didn’t say all I said the numbers are skewed because of modding. And modding your game isn’t as hard as you think it is especially on console. No you didn’t mention SE but with the large number mentioned I thought that was for both versions.
---
I'm glad I play normally. I enjoy this game to much to get banned
---
The 1000s of games available on Xbox? Smh
---
Yes!! Those goddamn blue duffel bags
---
Isn’t that a camp item?
---
Runs fine for me too unless there’s a nuke
---
Then why are you here?
---
Beating Scorchbeast Heart in jar.
---
Good, so no problem then
---
Whenever I feel the need to quickly level up, I just create a new character and level up three times within 20 minutes, switch characters and then claim the Legendary Run rewards on my main.
---
Ah okay. Could of sworn I read it disabled them for vanilla.
---
3800 hours? I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
You would have to ask those who are that high. I have been playing since launch. My Primary character is 500 and I was able to level up 2-4 times a day before the lunchboxes. I also found a group of players who likes to nuke prime multiple times a day. I am only trying to give you pointers on how to easily level. Focus on what you can control and not on a year from now. One thing I learned from playing this game is “don’t get used to how it is now”. Every patch bring changes. Good and Bad. Also there has been multiple double XP weekends and we even had a triple XP weekend. You will find a way, but remember to enjoy playing the game.
---
I didn't do it for those who have mastered the grinding, but for the rest. Not everyone can spend the insane amounts of time some of us spend playing the game, and not everyone bought it at release.
---
They are working on that right now. Hopefully this winter it will be finished. Bethesda will make it so you can place a door or such and make your camp an instanced based location. Meaning more freedom to build how you like and more budget. But if you want to make a underground bunker now you are in luck. There is a glitch to be able to build under the map. You put a bass on a rug and move the rug on the stairs. Then make the stairs go down and the bass in mostly under ground. This can take some time getting the right spot but eventually you will get it. Once you do that play the bass get out and build a floor or more stairs and voila you built an underground bunker.
---
This sub is filled with plenty who don't want to earn things. They basically want Fallout 76 to become creative-mode Minecraft.
---
Nope
---
could be that you were using a magic shotgun before? I read somewhere that gaus shotgun does not have magic effects and maybe what you are seeing is how shotguns are really supposed to be.
---
sheeit! can they make vats work at all would be a better question.
---
Interesting.
---
It's just greed.
---
It's everywhere that people are, because people are.
---
I’m new to this game, but damn if the creatures aren’t terrifying
---
The sailor challenges aren't the trouble. It's getting a level up that takes a while
---
No, the pursuit of profit is justified either way. To sustain yourself and to better your life is a noble, productive, and god blessed goal. My only complaint is that their model is bad for business, and that a smarter and more profitable strategy for them would be to simply make good games. Otherwise, why shouldn’t I just go play something else?
---
I don't actually rate Vanguards. I run a mix of other prefixes and I feel more universally resistant than with vanguards, as once you start getting bashed it's value plummets a bit. Sort of an argument for both.
---
I run an Instigating Fixer which, through stealth, let's me one shot most things as I sweep through.
---
I also got ragdolled by the ISS last night and didn't die. I mean, thoroughly messed up. I love full health personally.
---
Yeah and if need help building an underground camp go on YouTube there are videos that show how to do it step by step.
---
Graham killed 3 of my pets in two days.  I moved after I witnessed it. I camp off the main road now  on a mountain and keep my device really far away from any building. My pets survive for months now.
---
If you are talking about *Communist Bunker* then yes, it is available until september 8. For 700 atoms, or 1000 atoms for the entire bundle.
---
Thanks but for now, I'll stick with my metro cart home ;)
---
Please don’t take this the wrong way, but why are you browsing this sub then?
---
Ah thanks
---
Its a compact room with multiple hazards that will near insta-kill bloodied builds, endless hordes of glowing wendigos spawn and charge you. On top of Earl, who is a massive bullet sponge. The quicker you kill him, the quicker you get loot. He's plenty tanky that all 8 players, if that many even show, will get enough damage in to grab loot from his corpse.
---
This really reminds me of another comment I read on this sub. Someone was saying how they have a character they RP as a raider who gets bounties sometimes for picking locks just because he needs a place to sleep at night. That really struck me and is part of the reason I don't really ever feel like attacking wanted players, even knowing their game is limited by the status.
---
Yeah they need to drop this one. I don't wanna create a new character every single day just to get 500 SCORE. I don't wanna spend 3 hours everyday on this game.
---
I want to be able to play for say 3 days in a row for say 8 hours or more a day and get all I need and then stop playing and not touch it again for 2 weeks, a month, maybe more.
---
Yeah theres no way to track your personal cooldown either afaik.
---
Isn't the radium rifle garbage anyway because it does radiation damage which only matters against players?
---
This just further reinforces the fact that the Raiders are truly the best hope for a sustainable America being rebuilt instead of the settlers. Honestly, I hope when the BOS arrive they bully the settlers into giving them all their resources until Paige packs up and leaves. Would be nice if we could be the one taking equipment from the settlers too so that Ward can send people after us cause he's clearly incompetent.
---
It takes 8-10 minutes to create a new character, talk to Duchess and get to level 3. Some people do that every day.
---
If they do, you can always get 99.4% of your budget back but that involves moving your CAMP :/
---
If you have the herivore mutations it's 20% instead of 10, and if you also use strange in numbers perk while on a team it adds another 5 for 25% total.
---
Same works for the squirrel one, but with carnivore.
---
Level 229 here and I'm doing em lol
---
I dont use chems, and it's 635. And its not prime.
---
Edit. Its also not my main source of DPS, its the weapon I use casually. When I wanna drill damage I use my BFFR gauss mini
---
Wait really??? 
---
I didn't think it was that easy. 
---
Holy crap dude, you just saved me an extra 30-40 minutes a day. Idk why I never thought of thaf
---
This works better with the personal terminal, especially for PA users as you wont have to get out of your armor.  I also think the animation sequence is faster than instruments or crafting items.  My base uses it to keep a personal living quarters under my shops.
---
It also serves to keep people out, as only 3 people have had the courage to actually come in, as the rest are likely worried about a trap.  Even though there isn't one.  I dont have enough budget for that.  Too much decorations under here.  It's getting cramped.  Might have to blow out a wall.
---
Right? It’s like a spider in your house catching you off guard. You don’t need to kill them, but that’s your first reaction. Once you know you’re out of danger you’re fine again.
---
I’m not even sure I know how to google/research how to cheat on any game, never mind this one.
---
Yeah and you probably use it all the time in pve, where it's a cakewalk.
---
Also, Building Public team, extra intelligence means more xp gained
---
I have 80 odd levels I have not taken because I don’t want another 80 cards to scroll through when looking for super duper, hard bargain etc
---
If you ever find that place cleaned out the shack by the fissure at mosstown has a good stash of the same MRE style foods.
---
What platform and how many?
---
Good question
---
ive been kicked off my server every 5 minutes. public servers i cant even get on.
---
I was hoping to do this event last night. Kick ass picture.
---
I saw angry turtle die right after earl got killed, he just chilled by the entrance and still got the event rewards at least. I’m just super jealous you pc players already got the event so I’ve just been watching YouTube videos about it lol 😂
---
Manhunt 😃
---
Torpal was a miner living in Welch who was skilled in building and interior decorating. He now travels Appalachia, hanging onto the old world by scavenging for cool items to display in his home; he turned it into a trading spot and rest stop for wanderers. He uses his skills and interests to attempt to rebuild a new world atop ruins of the old, with some post war style influenced by local raiders and surivial groups. 
---
My great, great grandfather was a miner in Saltlick, West Virgina, which is an unincorporated town near Welch but it isn't featured in the game itself.
---
Best and most honest by far.
---
You probably already know but it’s not out on consoles yet, only pc😭
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like bugs on your jetpacks on your torso, so we made more bugs on your torsos, so you can jetpack while you bug in your torso.
---
#BugsLife
---
Or make it work like the ammo press from Fallout 3
---
If you have extra points, intelligence and endurance are always great stats to put them into. Iirc luck doesn't really affect much as a stat
---
Nice I didn't know the personal terminal worked. That will help me when I build the Lost Hills bunker just need that BOS field station from the Season 2 rewards and a new camp budget glitch. My character is a power armor build so this will help me a lot.
---
I play a shotgun/rifle and I can't wait to get my hands on that baby. Start with these perks: 3 to shotgunner, master and expert (9 total), 3 to sureshot(?) it's under strength not sure of the name. 3 to bloody mess, 3 to scatter shot.
---
Yeah I think Eso and all the dlc probably cost some people alot of money though. Lol 4 expansions at what? The price of a full game. That's a shit ton of money to invest even if the systems are better.
---
I switched to ultracite .308 and it makes more at the bench and hits harder dmg numbers on my LMG.
---
Criticals and the durability of weapons you find. Usually good for bloody mess, startch genes, and like a serendipity or I like ricochet for my melee build and thats about it unless your a crit muncher lol
---
People who say “I’m 100+ and I level several times a day” are popping every single buff and grinding like a mofo.
---
I agree it’s a crap daily/weekly. It encourages you to roll and discard alts, or power grind for hours a day.
---
No thanks. Turns out you don’t need to do it, though, to be on track for completion. So screw it.
---
Went vegan for this. Stated a carny on my melee, for the meat melee food buffs, canned meat stew is 20%- feed the people!
---
Why not both? Change ammo vendors into a converter with vendor interface and do the same with the current ammo converter. Win-win. You have a point though. I’ve never bought anything from any ammo or medical vending machine. I also run semi-auto rifles and have one in each ammo type
---
Another good place for this is Palace Of The Winding Path. A ton of flowers around the building/paths and crops on the north side.
---
Wall sections can be swapped at will because they're all exactly the same size. Vending machines however all have different hitboxes (aside from the vanilla recolors, which are all the same size), so allowing a quick swap in edit mode might be a bit more difficult than it is with wall pieces.
---
Stash your ammo and pick it up again. Or if you don't have room for that enjoy your never ending handmade. Eventually the clip will empty and it will reload the proper clip size
---
Also blueprint 2 stairs, me cliff needed👍
---
your explosive is making that damage jump higher and explosive is not that useful imo. But that damage isent that bad. Guess I’ll wait and see I’ll come back after my experience with it in the future.
---
Ya I enjoy my B guass as well, But I tend to use B Gatling plasma since it’s much more ammo efficient.
---
I see people come to workshop while its being claimed because sometimes they want to do a defense event.... but okay.
---
If you kill me ill just contest it while sneaking in chameleon in a corner where you can't find me.
---
Go ahead and Shoot potentially innocent people who just wanted to be neighborly and get a cup of free exp but instead all you gave them is cup of useless hot lead. Shame.
---
Just power armor lol but a lot of other stuff.
---
And hey Bethesda! Further incentive for him! If someone does buy your skin and there is a bug, they typically report it here and no one buys that skin. If this guy did review your stuff and vouched it is fixed, there wouldn't be any whistle blowers to hamper sales when it goes live since the bugs will have been worked out!
---
So my stats are 12s 7p 8e 5c 12i 5a 10l was going to move 5 for luck and move it to a and p
---
Crit dmg ?
---
I started doing monster mash for candy for the atom dailies and now I like it so much I sustain myself on Halloween candy and run rank 2 of the food weight perk just so it's weightless so I can carry my 10000 candy with me.
---
With the legendary perks just spec into both
---
Anything tall enough that has a transitional animation will work.  Just need to get past your waist.
---
My personal favorite is a friend of mine has a base that's basically completely underground with no visible above ground counterparts.  You fast travel .in for the vendor and just see nothing but barren land.
---
But if you place a pa frame in the right place on the ground and press activate (theres no visible prompt on the ground either wtf) you'll get sucked through the ground into a camp using the frame workbench.  Apparently this is impossible to replicate now but I thought this was great.
---
Another friend did something similar but he has an above ground component like I do, and his frame is just barely visible behind locked doors.  I like his camp better overall though.  He bought more goodies to decorate with.
---
Huh? The positives, as you called them, were listed as suggestions, not something that exists or is planned. This is not how the system works right now on PTS. Any progress you make on this is for the 1 character you make it on.
---
You paid for the base game, not any future expansions.  This is a live service game, not a "publish and maybe put out a bit of dlc but then never have to work on it again" game.  Live service games need revenue to continue producing content. They're a business model, not a charity.
---
Warframe doesn't even give away free currency beyond like thirty platinum you get when you start the game.  Beyond that  the only way to get your hands on it is to buy it for cash or get lucky with riven drops or very slowly farm prime parts and trade for it from other players.  Compared to that bethesda has always provided some sort of stream of guaranteed free atoms in one form or another.
---
Warframe is also only as f2p as it's players have patience for.  If tomorrow Bethesda announced they were adopting a similar model and started selling exp boosters, drop chance/rate boosters, inventory space and all of the non cosmetic stuff that Warframe sells this sub would go nuclear.
---
If you’re on PC, I need plasma cores :(
---
What do you mean by personal cooldown? I’ve launched a nuke then went to the next silo and launched another so I’m confused what you mean
---
I claim workshops all the time, 10% of the time i have pvp trouble thats easy to fix...just go to a different sever and slap contractor back on. Vast majority of the time i have no trouble, esp if i leave my nodes open for others to loot.
---
If you launch from Alpha, you can't launch from Alpha on any other server for 3 hours, each silo has a personal cooldown.  
---
\*EDIT\* Just to elaborate, if you launch from all 3 silos on a server and then server hop, you will be able to get all the way through launch prep on a new server and then when you enter your card and try to drop the nuke, it will eat your card and say recent user launch detected and list how long the cooldown is.
---
How many times in Fallout or any RPG for that matter, are there quests were someone’s willing to reward you for “dealing with the raiders”?
---
Right, but during Meat week you can actually feed her. So hungry Chally is returning.
---
Theyve said it going to be account based
---
I knew giving out free clothing was a niche market! I like to craft a bunch of skeleton costumes and masks sometimes and give one to every person I see. Once I had 5 noobies dressed up in it at the same time at the overseer's camp during a free weekend lol.
---
It’s definitely great exp. which is my only end game i can grind w/o it being limited like scrips &amp; caps.
---
I wish they'd fix it too... But it's not *that* hard to find things to tame. If you farm the random encounters where tamable animals spawn you find any of them pretty easily.
---
It wasn’t letting me into fort defiance today, I’d get through the door but it wouldn’t let me push the red button to get through the first security door. I’m also on Xbox
---
In front of Ward’s trailer like the Maggie she is
---
They have it there because there's ways to level up in minutes. Takes maybe 20-30 minutes to level up if you know the foods and buffs to stack.
---
Yeah it must be because of this recent update. Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
Why can’t u disclose the forum? What kind of fake news is this shitake mushrooms
---
Bubblegum counts as pre-war food too.
---
Couldn’t they just make you movie it until it’s a space it can fit into?
---
did it 5-6 times never had any problem
---
Durability is int.
---
exactly
---
No we do not
---
Mid-September, I think.
---
Like my non-existent house b/c i live in my grandma’s basement atm,  i want people to take their shoes off b4 they come into my house.
---
Look up angry turtles YouTube video. It explained everything for me
---
Froocking?
---
Explosive is extremely useful, it makes tagging mobs a breeze and then I let others kill and get their loot as well and all I had to do was fire a couple of rounds at the ground. It
---
The gatling is my regular use weapon because of how powerful its shots are and its very ammo friendly. But dps is not where it shines, so on tanky bosses like SBQ and Earl it is lackluster compared to high rate of fire heavies.
---
&gt;Not only they are not grindy like Legendary Perks
---
👀
---
If you wait until around september 10th, then there will be a scrip half off super sale. If you just wait some tine then you can get double with what you have
---
Well this is exactly why I’m grinding exp; so i can use all these perk coins on legendary perks which will be the grind of all grinds
---
But i feel like i should hold off at first when they are released incase they make it less grindy by increasing perk coin yields from perk cards
---
I didn’t know it was an actual location, I just thought it was a trailer cinematic.
---
Only God knows
---
I watched a lvl 100 scorchbeast level a guy's camp on the PTS. Those things are no pushovers anymore. I mean, if you cripple their wings they're manageable, but you better hope you have good armor penetration cause those bats now have a crazy health pool and resistance out the wazoo.
---
That's for crafted items, INT affects that. *Looted* item condition is affected by luck instead.
---
After season 1, but before season 3.
---
Wow that's really cool. All of the features in this game make building camps so much fun. Bethesda really needs to take advantage of this and make more things that make camp unique but isn't to hard to do. There are so many people that have small wooden box camps with only workbenches and vendors. Most people don't make cool camps because they don't have the resources or don't know how to do it. I had to watch videos to understand what cool glitches are available to make your camp look cool and what places are the best to build a camp. If Bethesda made it so they reward you for making a unique camp I believe a lot of people what start getting involved in doing that.
---
I had pizza last night
---
let’s go my nickname is wureide
---
Can you not check yourself?
---
Legendary run is already across all characters.
---
Cranberry Relish + Herbivore + Inspirational  + No life
---
Absolutly not, they were all boring and annoying to complet. It was just not fun, i eventualy got so tired to look around for pre-war food and shit.
---
Now we actually have to complet specific activies, if we wanna progress and get the Atoms.
---
Do we get enough Atoms ? I'd definitely say no and this is terrible. I just came back to the game after near 2 months away and this week if i'm lucky enough i'll get near 500 atoms ( once my 1/3 of the season pass completed ). I don't know how it works once your season pass completed but i'm quite worried !
---
I really like the season pass and the public team system. They really refresh the way we play the game and farm our xp ( mostly for the score points...lvl up is now fun ). I can't wait for "Fallout 76 One" so i can play more events and take full advantage of my public teams bonus. But Jesus...
---
We  need atoms !
---
I suggest this. Buy legendary modules. They are used to craft legendary weapons and armor once you finish the wastelanders (not saying anything else because spoilers)
---
Don’t overlook assisting others on their defense either. It’s an easy way to get xp too
---
Nope it’s updating
---
This season ends Sep 10th, there's apparently gonna be a grace period between the season end and start that will have weekly and daily atom challenges. This is what I've gathered from ITV's, and BGS's tweets, community posts/responses
---
My guess is September 24th
---
They never promised full on awappable builds. What they promised was perk loadouts. Your points stay where they are but you can save card arrangements.
---
 We can all keep wishing for bigger stash as much as we want but servers aren't made out of rubber. There's only so much shit that can be  stashed between all players before stability becomes an issue. We started at 400. They made enough progress to double it. I don't expect any more knowing that the underlying engine was never meant to be used for a multiplayer game.
---
But with bethesda we aren't too sure if they will screw that up or not.
---
Oddly, I’m pretty sure I tried Mac and cheese twice and it didn’t count.
---
Mutants are not known for their intelligence
---
It would force them to fix it first. Nobody is gonna buy it if it's clearly broken
---
Don't use your salad fork.
---
For armor its just recieve less damage from blocking if you have that 1 perk on anything you are wearing it activates
---
Also it only works for shotguns in vats or for a gun that is 180 rate of fire or higher
---
I’ve been consistently checking scene encounter locations since wastlelanders dropped, and only just now found one. I use the random encounters TZmap, and check any nearby locations when I’m running around. I’ve found hundreds of other tames, but not one other deathclaw.
---
I'm not basing my words on what they said, but what the PTS is. It's not on the PTS. The slots are shared but not the cards themselves.
---
Season 2 is delayed, heres season 1.5
---
Myea, I was kinda having a hard time finding a way to describe what happened clearly, but thanks, that's kind.
---
Maybe a scorched in power armor? I doubt anything can grow into a monstrosity that is a mole miner while confined in a small suit, especially with a helmet. Maybe a super mutant taking PA apart and wearing it as protection, idk.
---
The magic on armor is the exact same as for weapons just you don't need it on the weapon to activate if you have the armor
---
Heck, I wish it was invisible rather than having to see this monstrosity roaming around (note, not me in the footage, I was dead, and this is PS4) [https://youtu.be/\_Xp0kaZgB-U](https://youtu.be/_Xp0kaZgB-U)
---
Probably easy to get a group with comms going
---
But yeah, and solos mode is needed. There's only so much you can do when outnumbered 1 to 3 or 1 to 4
---
Or just redo the respec system so you only need one
---
Mine was AAE... \*grumble\* Maybe now is the time to switch to bloodied! XDD
---
Yeah, I only craft my legendaries, so I didn't think about it.
---
How do you get through the day sober?!
---
Confirmed.
---
When someone makes you mad, murder them.
---
i’m bloodied and I don’t have a problem dying under 20%. There are special spots of high ground to not get attacked by wendigo, and the hazards are always in the same spots. Super stim-pack is my bestfriend incase things do get rough. But all in all, a vats crit one head shot weapon should instakill the  wendigos combined w/ the grim reaper sprint perk card for ap refresh to reduce the swarms.
---
Staying in the middle then transitioning outside every often helps too
---
Both: They're Military Wallpaper/Foundations. 
---
Plus with the Brotherhood Field Station coming in Season 2 I'm going to definitely build up my camp as an above-ground Brotherhood bunker (Field Station doors - Bunker Foundations/Wallpaper) I'm excited.
---
I can’t ever do it with mine as well for some reason.  Idk if it’s damage based or hit based. I used a TS it didn’t show much result after couple reloads.
---
I throw floater freeze Grenades at her when she lands . It works.
---
A lot.of the other part is the plans thing.  Theres so many plans and finding a specific one can take a while.  You have to give yourself projects, and at some point, my monolithic home, while appealing, wasnt cutting it.  So I focused on a new home.
---
Now I have it, so I make minor improvements as I get new things one table for another and the like, but my main focus is on expanding and honing my arsenal. 
---
The reward for a nice camp is really just a nice camp and some people just dont care enough about it.  The camp for them is just a functional storage and workshop.  And that's fine.  I guess...
---
Is lying a high charisma option? Because I’ve never seen that dialogue choice.
---
I’m making this post after having played all day; just a few notes. First off I love everything, the colossus event is so atmospheric that the first time I played it brought back the memory of my best LitS events. These notes are after having ran multiple times.
---
1. Fast travel back to the mine places you outside, and the entrance still has rubble. I got trapped outside after consuming a nuka shine.
---
2. Too many wendigos. Between them staggering and the colossus making you run, it’s a lot of time you’re not in control. It can be exhausting in a very long fight.
---
3. Too dark, it’s hard to appreciate the area as much. 
---
4. Too many bodies causing graphical degradation and FPS drop.
---
5. The mine collapses too quick after you kill the colossus. Perhaps the mine should stick around until the end of the event on the current server, and it just keeps spawning regular wendigos.
---
6. This is related to the patch, but my allies keep standing outside at the edge of my camp instead of inside. This was after my camp icon bugged and I couldn’t fast travel to camp.
---
Reebok
---
We already don’t have to talk to the Chief for Cop a Squatter, what more do you want?
---
Oh ok
---
Just throw it on the pile of bugs topped by Todd's throne
---
So if I've got 1 armor piece with 15% LDWB and I wear it while using V.A.T.S with any Shotgun or while using any weapon with 180+ fire rate that'll give me a damage increase?
---
TACTICAL ADIDAS! INCOMING!
---
FTFY. Only Todd knows.
---
If I remember correctly its been broken for awhile/forever
---
Much like crippling the queen to get her to land more oftenly
---
Use that $60 for anything else. See how long that lasts. Unless you have a reasonable argument, don’t act like we haven’t gotten plenty of content.
---
I love mine.  Mutated/+10% aiming. I think the damage is 704.  If VATS works I can one shot a 68 in the torso but it is all about your Perks
---
You need 8
---
Damn, the feels.
---
If you spend now, and don’t have much good gear, 3 star for armor and 2 for weapons. The first two stars are what matter for weapons, and until you have a good weapon it’s better to get more rolls by only going for two stars. Once you have a good weapon then you can try for more stars
---
When I didn't know picking locks wasn't allowed I picked one and became wanted. Someone came to my camp, gave me the thumbs up emote, then killed me in one shot and left 100 stimpacks
---
I was like, fair enough
---
That would explain it. Thanks.
---
I haven’t done it in awhile so I don’t know the exact stat required. Yes I’m pretty sure it’s charisma.
---
It’s hidden. You’ll be surprised how many dialog choices are not greyed out and not shown in the choices.
---
You're probably not very close to max rep with either faction yet at level 50 and the sale is a ways off so if you don't spend scrip now you'll be wasting everything you could earn between now and then. If you don't have the perfect weapon for your build yet buy 2 star legendaries. You'll get twice as many chances at something good and the 3rd effect is never nearly as important as the first 2.
---
But then I have to spend 30 min customizing the facial features every time. I can't just have a new toon out there with default facial features!
---
Don't buy them if you don't want the weapons though, bad advice.
---
They know what plasma and fusion cores are. They made the game.
---
I didn't buy it at release, sorry the joke was kind of harsh but honestly the issue is this huge focus on grinding on the first place. I just find it sad how many people here have to give tips on how to play through the content of this game as quickly as possible because all there is, is grind.
---
I go to ward. Drop grape mentats for more cash from him cause I fail the perception check, then go to Davenport and lie
---
I think it's better to implement a system to log accounts and IP addresses for about a week and then do a mass ban on those accounts a week latter to catch way more people. 
---
This recent ban wave, has only hit people as they have logged in since the patch
---
I mean, that's a way to solve it. It's not a way that provides replayability for the players or player retention for Bethesda to report on, but sure, it's a way.
---
Still easier and more beneficial to both sides to have reasons for having alts. It's widely encouraged by many online games, so why isn't it here.
---
Mmmm... Pizza...🍕
---
I’ll have to remember that. Thanks.
---
Thats how its working for me! And thats the way I understand it angry turtle is kinda confusing
---
Sweep the legs, Johnny.
---
How exactly if I may ask? Sorry havent done much team play with this game.
---
I did the same thing when I was farming rep. I went through three Deathclaws, two megasloths, two bears, two mirelurk kings and several radtoads before I decided pets just aren't worth it. This was a two week period. Maybe I just had good luck... But then again I was literally just running around in loops of random encounters and doing nothing else. Again, I hope they fix the pets at some point, because I do want one.
---
B...But where’s Todd.
---
True. But the armor currently has the best resistances.
---
Your really doing him a favor. Wendingos are cannibals right? So you're doing the world a favor. Lol
---
Because it's addicting, nonetheless.
---
That reply made no sense.
---
If you are gearing for ranged play then just switch to Rifleman build for a while. No need to bother with melee if you don't want to.
---
Just wait until the sale and only spend 150 a day so you can make it back
---
...uh, he/she was attempting to rip you off by max cap stinging you.  You apparently are too dumb to realize this, which is why this whole futile attempt to grief you seems to have gone over your head.  Like most of the remaining player base of this shitty game... you're also clearly a magoo who thinks this is a great game, the community is wonderful, and the game could be improved by being everything a fallout game isn't.  
---
Cheers with that.
---
It just depends, tbh.  What I would say is wait until you finish all the wastelanders content and know what you want.
---
Yeah, sometimes when I use VATS in PVE, it will randomly kick me out of VATS regardless of whether or not I have enough AP.
---
The grounded mutation helps with those some, if you don't use energy weapons.
---
Don't know if it ever got patched but wasn't one option just to server hop right after selling the photos? I typically took photos of foundation, sold them to the raiders, server hopped, and then collected the rewards from DP. The game always treated it was if I never sold the photos in the first place.
---
Job?  Wife?  Kids?  ...and you play Fallout 76?  
---
lol
---
Reputation: Wild Child
---
ok dad
---
Had something  similar happen to me earlier today. It was me - a 197 commando, and a 46 heavy gunner in the mine. I think he took the brunt of the damage while I was sneaking around, but we managed to kill Earle with a couple minutes to spare. Tough fight though, not sure I could do it solo.
---
Eat the meat with your hands. Utensils are for snobs!
---
In your house with a copy of skyrim for every system
---
Hmm that’s interesting. I never knew that. Guess that’s something I could try out to see if it works.
---
I definitely works, was on 3 SBQ events yesterday and each time she was frozen
---
Do you mean, how can you play Medic?
---
Yeah I freeze her all the time, Quad is most effective. Mines QE though don't know if that makes a difference
---
Ah that explains why I hear Alexa in the other room playing Skyrim...
---
Are you sure it wasnt floater freezer grenades? Those work like a charm, and I've been seeing these same "cryolator doesn't work on SBQ" for weeks now
---
Put out the fires, and don't forget to actually put your greens and meat into the boxes before the timer runs out.
---
They need to get a good mix in between the two. Stuff like the junkyard bundle doesn’t really fit with the theme of the game. We were in a vault for 25 years, with training and experience to literally rebuild America, and you want us to slap together some tires, scrap metal, and slabs of wood?
---
Didn’t see any grenades being thrown and once she was frozen in mid air
---
Lol take her legs out and no laser
---
[FO wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Search?query=solar+armor)
---
What's the experience for lvl 100 super mutants looking like? Intel and buffs while it was earned is def info thatd help. Exp for scorchedbeasts wouldn't hurt.
---
It was a joke. If they did play the game for more than few minutes they would know how broken it can be. im not convinced they do.
---
His accent kinda fucks me up sometimes.
---
Personally I'm just sick of all my loading screens being pictures of the Black Bear Lodge.
---
Could you give me some advice on that then? Because I’ve spent multiple, multiple hours of server hoping spots and can’t find *anything* to tame, let alone a deathclaw.
---
Starched genes, bloody mess, class freak and serendipity
---
It's been a while since I've done the quest so like said, I can't really guarantee that it'll work. Good luck though!
---
I’m lvl 265 and I get a couple levels a day and I don’t grind xp or play for more than a hour it’s easy to level up if you are fighting the right enemies and playing in the right areas
---
It's a known exploit using the blueprint system.
---
1. I have roughly 150 Halloween Candy on my main char. Finding pre-war food isn't too hard. Not hoarding and keeping one's stash mostly full helps storing items for later.
---
2. I try and do the Workshops late at night if I can. I have a couple of alts that I use as well.
---
3. Some of the "Kill X # of robots" specify what kind of robots. Take a picture of that list and learn where there are static spawns.
---
4. Yes. If that one is being farmed a lot then the Spooky House place far NE usually has at least one Glowing Ghoul or a Wendigo. There's that one bunker with two roaming Deathclaws and one tends to be Legendary.
---
5. I've found gum as a static spawn at the Halloween house with the annoying Pumpking Carving Robot and in Morgantown HS.
---
6. Depending on the time of day/night outside the mine can have up to 6 at least. You can get the rest before going to the area where that Even starts.
---
The point I'm trying to illustrate is that more money/continued profit isn't a guarantee of quality, or worthwhile support to the game and your concerns as a player. The continued patronage of others on secondary or tertiary transactions is not automatically a benefit to everyone else.  Unless of course your whole mindset is a rather optimistic "any update is a good update".  But you're right about one thing, cutting off microtransactions won't be an assurance of quality, just like providing more money to the game won't be an assurance of quality either.
---
The problem is, and always will be with games like this is that the companies in charge have a tendency to start small with their monetization, then as time goes on, they start expanding to a point where their methods have real in-game effects, and soon, it's a very noticeable change in the way they integrate their monetization across the game.  
---
A line has to be drawn at some point with how much is acceptable and what isn't, otherwise, you get into scenarios where there's way too much of a push in monetization, but the game ultimately has not changed for the better despite that excess, and continued support for the game is more like a limbo where the game might have support, but it's always in an awkward state with polarizing, or bad content, and many bugs.  But you can be damn sure the *only* thing the developers will always be on top of is whenever they tweak, or add onto the next microtransaction batches every week and month.  Those will always tend to be flawlessly executed.
---
Something to consider is that anytime you give money to a company through transactions like this, you're also indirectly giving an admission that you like the way things are, and want more of that. So, guess what people who have Fallout 1st subscriptions and buy Atoms are indirectly also supporting when the game releases with buggy updates or mechanics people dislike? 
---
It's all enabling them to continue on track, and that is probably reason #1 why people supporting the game, and continued support is not automatically a good thing unless you genuinely find whatever is being done to be enjoyable to your tastes.  If not, and you have major bones to pick with design, lack of QA, then your voice tends to be ignored in the grand scheme of things, because who do you think is going to be catered to when designing the next things in line? It's going to be for the people who spend the money.
---
If it reaches a point where the game only appeals to people who are more likely to spend money, and content is designed around encouraging that, then do you honestly think I'm going to be  pleased with that sort of game being updated when it no longer caters to my voice and concerns? Hell no, I'd never support that, and I'd rather encourage others to not spend a single dime if that's the direction the game takes.
---
He is also naked... maybe he is looking for a good time?
---
Speaking of which, Bethesda really needs to add an emote for that....
---
3rd so I don't barf.
---
What do you mean by magic? Some special kind of legendary? I thought that the quad shotgun might already do the trick. But sometimes it seems that it does not perform to well compared to my other legendary shotgun with 50% limb damage...
---
Hmm you could have stumbled onto a brilliant idea. A bethesda camp, maybe moderators or whomever they have in game can use their camp as the demos
---
Who do you sell oil to and how much ?
---
Who hurt you?
---
There is a feature that you can blueprint Ammunition Factory from the Workshop... Why do I say "feature"? Well, you dont have to use any exploits or hacks to blueprint it. And I doubt that AAA company would leave such thing for such a long period of time unattended if it was an exploit.
---
Same problem here. Just fell into it lol. Yay no progression. 15 days later? Still no fix?
---
The purveyor sale is a long way away, so I recommend spending the scrip now. Weapons wise, go for two stars: most of the second effects are actually pretty good, whereas the third stars are mostly rubbish. Also, good two star weapons that you don't like can be sold in your player vendor.
---
Armor wise it's worth going for the three stars, but depending on what stage you're at I'd recommend sticking to weapons. A good weapon is going to make your life vastly easier, as it will just open up the entire map to you. And at the end of the Wastelanders quest chain you gain the ability to buy plans for the secret service armor with gold bullion - and this happens immediately (whereas the weapon plans require a lengthy rep grind). So you can gradually start putting together a set of secret service armor with legendary modules.
---
Also, you're starting to reach the point in the game where you can fairly reliably get 1400 caps per day by clearing a couple of locations and selling all the weapons you pick up - so it might be worth checking out some player vendors to see if they have good items on offer.
---
I'm sure they'll still talk to me like I'm an idiot.
---
This comment just gave me +300 rads.
---
No, but theoretically you can show screenshots to Steam support, they could cut the subscription and you could resub. (maybe :d).
---
All I'm saying is we got more content for 60$ from FO3/NV/4, not to speak of games like Witcher. Also a lot of FO76 content is really FO4 content.
---
I think they spent most of their time and money on tricking the engine into somewhat supporting online multiplayer and still have to pour lots of resources to this aspect fixing bugs, preventing duping, or even just delivering basic features.
---
just reached out to steam, they have at least acknowledged my issue, which is more than Bethesda has done
---
True. Now all it needs is a ghost people outfit lol
---
What I heard is that TwoShot cryolator is the best on freezing her. I dont have one so not sure it's easy to get or not.
---
Almost every decision they made clearly shows they had no idea how they were going to implement any of these let alone a roadmap. Sure they probably had a few themes in mind and la concept but when it comes to actual thought out and well implemented mechanics it shows that the head in the hand might as well be up its own butt.
---
Bugs since beta eh, qa issues since day one eh, not listening to the community unless things are really bad and still managing to screw up,  starting to slip by giving fallout first obvious throw away none themed items that were probably for score or event rewards. Going back on plans such as no matter what everyone got a decent reward during events not just the one capable of one shotting a sbq before anyone gets damage threshold done. Camp issues, restrictive camp issues, balancing issues, ignoring legendary effects that are pretty much useless or undesirable, ignoring weapons that need reworked, more mods etc. 
---
Biggest issue from start? Going into this with a second hand support team incapable of actually doing what is required of any support in a multiplayer game like this. Got a missing quest item because you missed a step? Cant go back to get said item? Better hope the area you need to go is never used again!
---
There will be a million lamers telling you that you HAVE to bang on the drums and turn the spits, and literally nothing else matters. This is complete crap. Kill critters and deposit them. Collect firewood and keep the fire stoked. The event will complete in a couple of minutes max.
---
It is a high  Charisma dialog choice but you can overcome the charisma  Requirement with magnetic personality perk or  Grape mentats or formula P
---
I have gotten some cool plans from joining defense events. Good stuff indeed
---
We know it's a joke. A shitty one that doesnt make sense.
---
I think it makes it difficult because of the SPECIAL allocation. Commando will need high perception while heavy needs high strength. He will already have high agi because of the need for stealth. So at this point, he will probably need to choose between the two specs in order to have enough SPECIAL points for support abilities.
---
Why so mad its only game?
---
I decided to launch my first nuke at 300.then forgot to do it and did it at 306 haha
---
Yea, they are DUMB. Once I had a problem with atomstore item purchase (it bugged) and I explained the whole problem, said the exact name of the item, exact time, etc, and they replied that they will gladly look into it, but they need me to write when did it happen and the exact name. It took them another 2-3 days to respond again :'D.
---
Either me or one of my friends use a cryo with the crystallizing barrel and we get her frozen every time. Extremely helpful for my stealth melee build, when she actually lands that is.
---
Just about everything in this game has been recycled, repackaged, and resold.  And they want people to continue throwing money at it?
---
I think the only reason you want the 'horn' is because it complements the wendigo 'balls' so well....
---
This comment however is like a refreshing rad-away with the negative effects suppressed.
---
That's just the state of the industry now. Look at WoW back when it came out vs WoW classic. The level of support is evident.
---
Your completely right.  And I just assumed he would have enough points to invest into all of the above or if you have access to the pts just try out both build there that way your not locked into one build
---
Strangler heart is the better pa, with how Dr works in this game there is little difference defensively between the 2. The sh set has the bounse, which is small but its still something. The real issue is getting the mods for it
---
These idiots should know better than to build them in a public server
---
Ult gat lasers, hold 1k rounds and are super accurate. And flamers, awesome for clearing rooms, if a bit hungry haha
---
Not an exploit at all. /s
---
To each their own.
---
Blood, scorched, vaccine, and nukashine
---
If you add those, you’re at 12
---
I bulk it to sell to the robot vendors but sometimes I put it in my vendor machine.  I put a lot of junk scrap (eg steel scrap, waste oil, etc) in my vendor and sell it for 1 cap each.
---
This would actually be really awesome to do in whitesprings. I mean, they already have alot of decorations lined up in the vendor 'stores'. Just replace them with atom store stuff or make one of those stores specifically designed to display all the stuff currently on the atom store.
---
I want maggie to come to my camp. I have a trophy I'd like to show her 😈
---
PC is PC and PS4 is PS4... You have to start over on the console. Good luck!
---
yeah you said theres healers, how is it done?
---
Ps4 and as many caps as you can carry im going to new vegas
---
Simple suggestion, make specific repeatables give 15-25 atoms or something once you max out a score board. Make it so you can choose a score boards item, or atoms (unless already atoms). Example? Probably never gonna wear captain cosmos costume let alone make it. Only way ill ever think about it is if they make a none budget eating way to display outfits which wont happen.
---
good to know thank you
---
Berry mentats
---
Certain legendary effects make shotguns do 3-4 times the damage they should in vats. 50% limb damage is one of them. If you want to know more, check out Angry Turtle’s recent video on YouTube about magic weapons.
---
I'm on xbox
---
Gotta flex - 10 seconds from spawn I usually get that done. Unless he glitches into the wall.
---
&gt;It's obvious they don't want to keep doing atom dailies so we should just get used to that fact.
---
No, we really shouldn't.
---
I mean, if you have a source for what you said, feel free to provide one. Maybe I'm missing something.
---
Thank you for this amazing contribution to the thread.
---
Don't Ever Fuck Grahms?
---
Gauss mini penta laughs at your 180 fire rate needed.  Also the vats trick works on any split weapon including legacy gat plasma and flamer expos.    
---
Note: while it works for splits it is not quite as powerful, unless it is legacy.  Extra note Sniper barrel plus splitter on a sneaky pistol build is stupidly fun you get a huge range bonus and you get the magic. HAven't tested a two shot to see if the extra beam splits but if it does then a TS laser would be better than a shotty with the right perks.
---
Kinda hard to gauge who did it though. The original person may have logged off, and someone else just captured the workshop. The ammo generators could have been there all day.
---
Hmmm.... reading your post makes me want to make a trap base. Weekend goals
---
Need legendaries? Go and try to run Riding Shotgun, it has 1 legendary Blood Eagle Captain no matter what and the event spawns a lot of mobs with decent odds to get more legendaries. Because Leader of the Pack is sometimes hit by multiple people and you cannot get all 3 wolves.
---
I dunno as is my camp is randomly attacked by level 80 scorchbeast once in a blue moon. My rocket launcher turrets which are only thing able to remotely stop the lvl 60 raiders/cultist who randomly spawn to when I stop by also wreck turrets. Which essentially are there to stall things, as turrets are useless.
---
Maybe its finally Fallout New Orlea- yeah me neither.
---
Okay thats what i was hoping for i was just worried that if I signed in on my PC bethesda.net that it would transfer over my characters and I would be stuck starting over on PC with all my shit on my Ps4
---
take in on and off, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Literally takes me no more than 15 minutes to level in the 200s. Herbivore with high int and xp food buffs going. I have a set path I take which has 8-10 big mobs out in the bog along with the standard creep. Normally walk out with 5 legendaries also.  It's not hard if you play it smart and get it out of the way fast.
---
On in 5 mins. You?
---
I’d sell them to random people and use the caps to buy 45. from the ammo dispensers that are at the railway stations
---
Woo, more bandaids. Most of the cheats and exploits in this game wouldn't even be possible if they had a sensibly designed client/server architecture. Until/unless they actually fix their core design flaws, their anemic "ban waves" are pointless.
---
I heard it might have to do with The donut vendors skins. Something about players dc while browsing, not sure if that’s the case here
---
Nope, I don't have them. I have the standard vendors. But my displays in my house also just empty into my stash.
---
Ah, no idea what May be causing it then...
---
I also heard that season 4 got loaded into the season 1.5 slot by mistake.... So I guess instead of brotherhood of steel, we are getting The League of Extraordinary Ghouls....
---
Same here, no more than 30 seconds, almost instant score.
---
A lot less tedious than trying to naturally level every day.  Run through the vault, don't bother picking up anything.  If you have a friend online you can have them go to the Overseer's Camp so you can ft to them.  If not then just run there first, craft a melee weapon, craft some armour then enter the Wayward. You can spam the button to skip through the conversation inside the Wayward.
---
It could count as encouraging exploits, as he'd be sending people to the site
---
Unless she’s a naked model, and they designed that suit as part of her body.
---
Level up.... ehhhhhhh?
---
That was the other guy, but there are a few things that can let you play medic.  A bunch of Charisma cards let you help team mates, like the one where burning a friend with a Flamethrower heals them. The Team Medic card Stims your friends when you use a stimpack. Higher CHA lets you share stronger perks too, so at 15, you can share some strong abilities, like weapon damage, item weight reduction or mutation bonuses. If you don't mind playing support, there's a lot of ways to do it.
---
having a scorched thats been "fused" to PA would be interesting, but what gameplay purpose would it serve?
---
You need to have a frame and pieces already, then you go into a PA station and mod it with the paint.
---
And be aware that not all skins work on all models of PA. I use Ultracite myself, and very few are available for it...I haven’t checked the one you’re after yet, but take that into consideration.
---
Problem is I already have 5 chars...
---
I guess it’s like that from the beginning because we high levels know the struggle and difficulty to get aids (haha) and ammo and other bits and pieces to get the game going in a way so giving loot would help you get better and effectively you do the same unintentionally to the new players in the future
---
Why would people just give you caps for free?
---
B..but I like having a camp in the mountains. It’s fun to make bridges, stairs and make buildings on em.
---
I’ve seen a lot of unique and fun camps. You should check out YouTube.
---
Since your new it may not be that great because your lacking a lot of stuff.
---
For an atom shop bundle contemporary bundle is an amazing camp set if you ever see it. If you have enough atoms to get it ofc.
---
Issa joke
---
Yes it is!!! Till one runs inches in front of you lmfao spinning death for eternity
---
Your intelligence is too low for you to figure out a new level every day.
---
Kinda smart if Bethesda starts snooping around, still don't like that it's destabilizing the economy
---
tough guy
---
It means he likes you &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Easy pre-war food: equip the can-do perk and loot trash cans.  Even easier: do this at whitespring
---
It finally worked for me. I had to go into my private lobby. I think the guys at the top are onto something. If someone in your lobby already did this quest, then it doesn't let you do it again. I tried ten times and noticed people had gone through the building already, but going into private lobby seeing all doors were closed and obviously no one in the lobby had access, I was able to fix this. Blood first then fuse. Finally worked.
---
You're not supposed to apply the Toxic Goo from West tek anally....
---
I’ll have a slight disagreement on the first part of the post- there are definitely some flat areas in the map, though they aren’t always too common. For example, the iron/copper cliff is pretty flat imo. On the other hand, the junk/lead location is on a hill. On that note I think that if the game *was* designed to have flat areas for camps everywhere, it would negatively impact the map.
---
Some flat areas could include: roads, some areas along the river on the east side of the forest, some cliffs, etc. 
---
The clipping is shit though and every time something is green but says it has a problem I scream.
---
I never have screws I do have about 40 gauss miniguns tho
---
HAHA! YOU MAY HAVE BEATEN MY SPECIAL TECHNIQUE BUT YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT MY.....\*retreats\*

This is why I refuse to use custom paints until they introduce a locking feature.
---
I don't, and PvE is where it ought to be used. If you need it in PvP then you're bad at the game, just that simple.
---
The irony.
---
I'd stick with cranberry bog, as I never found anything outside of it, although I am assuming it is possible.
---
I now only check two points, one east of The Thorn, one north east of it.
---
If nothing is there I hop, alternating public and private server if available.
---
Took me about one and a half hour to replace my Deathclaw (who died in mysterious circumstances after a few weeks...) with another, and the first one was caught there too.
---
Only other tamable creature I found there was a rat, no idea what else can spawn.
---
Beckley Mine Exhibit.  I've never had a challenge given me there.  Seems a lot of people haven't--I almost always find a foundation, a few walls, and a bunch of lights or power connectors stuck on when there's a 'build up a CAMP' daily or weekly.  Sometimes there's a whole bunch of random crap if the server's been up a while.
---
Until a recent patch I had a gatling plasma that wouldn't use cores, every time I would reload the number of cores never dropped
---
Also, be aware that you'll need to already have a jetpack torso to apply the skin to it.
---
Ouch.  This makes my nearly 1k hours look like rookie numbers.
---
This game community is awesome!
---
I had 20 min to kill before work.
---
Logged on and hit my usual lead farm route, Green County, Prison, Palace, Monorail (I skipped Vault Tec due to time constraint)
---
Then crafted a few thousand .50 cal rounds and called it a night.
---
Ah. Ok. Didn’t know. I only play with one character. LoL.
---
Yes, this is what happens in a world where drugs are so widespread...
---
Keep gifts on you for the alcohol and food challenges.
---
I was just saying their are a good substitute for the 50. Rounds if you haven't got the mods.
---
Some days you have a random encounter
---
Some days you *are* a random encounter
---
I feel bad for the devs at this point. It's really obvious they are being absolutely ass rammed by management and are too inexperienced to keep up with everything we need. I really hope they get extra funding and staff at some point. It must be hell trying to run stuff.
---
8 Charisma required for that option.
---
My camp is under attack by leveled ghouls, super mutants, liberators, mole miners, snallygasters, or bears every single time I log in. My camp is at the southern edge of the white springs golf field. Lol
---
Check out r/fallout76settlements they do some amazing stuff over there
---
Imagine believing champion points aren't grindy.
---
There's a difference there?
---
A "series of one time purchases" base game + paid expansions.....
---
A one time purchase (DLC for free)+ entirely optional microtransactions....
---
Actually there is. You get the base game and dlc free.... And the additional purchases, cosmetics etc, are entirely optional...
---
Meaning you can enjoy the entire game and expansion's core experience without being forced to pay like with paid expansions. Meaning if you forego the, again, entirely optional microtransactions, you pay less to play 76 than "back in the day" with paid expansion games. 
---
The "once upon a time" thing is so tired. Especially for those of us who played games, once upon a time, when they didn't have expansions, and entire games came on cartridges, and previews and reviews were only available in magazines.
---
Not really unless you bounced splash damage
---
In my experience tho, swatting at a naked man with a rolled up newspaper only makes it worse
---
Platform? 
---
I’m on PS4 and it was fine earlier today.
---
I’m somewhere in between, I love CAMP building and I spent a lot of time with FO4 building but its been nerfed so hard since then. 
---
A flip / tilt button would be nice along with the option to choose which axis it would flip / tilt.
---
Yes they should improve these things because for many people it's half the game.  I do like that you can put up a camp pretty much anywhere you want on the map, unlike FO4.  Unfortunately packing up and moving is like a disease.   I'll spend an entire day setting up an elaborate base camp, and although I tell myself this is it, I'm off like a hobo two days later ready to start again.  I'm like Johnny Cash in Appalachia...I've been everywhere man!
---
Whenever plasma cores start taking up serious weight in my stash I go find a Gatling Plasma or buy one cheap, run through all the cores, then get rid of the gun. It’s very liberating not having to worry about replacing spent ammo.
---
All RNG. 
---
Relating to the loot ofc.
---
Great idea about the glowing sea, love your concept of something similar
---
I can hop on real quick
---
I would LOVE a vault suit outfit. Not underarmor that gets covered up with bulky, mismatched armor, but just a vault suit. Maybe a variant or two with a couple of pieces of leather armor, similar to some of the promo images for Fallout 4.
---
Nah if a spider appears in my house it's gotta die.
---
Well, time to farm the imposter for the fixer plan
---
Imagine just playing the game with multiple characters contributing towards getting them without having to optimize your build for XP or regretting past decisions that gimped you in the end because you changed your points around a year ago.
---
TSE15r Fixer, nice. no, it's completely random. like mostly every other roll in the game. you just got lucky.
---
I'm not familiar enough with arena (had 3 nukes crash before I was finally able to reach Earle) but there's a mound with some yellow machinery that serves as cover for sneak builds. granted, I don't think you'd be able to take him down with just your hunting rifle.
---
might want to switch to a commando now with that fixer, ha.
---
Having a Deathclaw in Forest basically allows you to have zero defences. And it's pretty cool when you hear the ground shaking and then you see it charge. 😂
---
It would probably get killed pretty fast in any other area tho...
---
Where did you found the Kings? If you remember. 🙄
---
While the build system does in fact have its share of annoying issues, I have the flat land complaint. 
---
The map may not be flat or as you put it " not made with camp in mind", but flat land camps in 76 are gaudy or boring most of the time. 
---
The best camps are built into the landscape, they look like they belong in the setting. Not some building just plopped down on a perfectly flat plot of land.
---
Oh I didn't even think about that pain, I feel for you
---
The trophy case is already an item, but I don't think you can put anything inside of it. So its useless. :(
---
Also yes! Personal vault please! My absolute favorite thing to build in Fo4 is Vault 88.
---
You don't. There are no headlamps for the ultracite or excavator pa
---
I have some ground rules. If they’re just chilling in the corner not bothering anyone I leave em be. If they’re in my room I kill them. If they surprise me by suddenly appearing too close and catching me off-guard I panic and kill them, then feel bad about it. Also black widows and wolf spiders I kill just because they’re assholes and their bites can mess you up.
---
There was a GIANT garden spider that moved into the bushes next to my porch, he was my best buddy that summer. I had zero bug problems like I had earlier in the year and the summer before. I used to have to swat my way through a cloud of mosquitoes when I came home from work, but after he showed up they all disappeared.
---
I’m level 55 and I still can’t get the 2nd perk for gunsmith ??? What gives?
---
That sucks, but same with t-65 too, couldn't find a single one for mine
---
Don't think it exists friend, sorry.
---
Check atom shop deals, do what challenges I can, log off.
---
I believe so. All the new pa's didn't get headlamps for some reason
---
I'm the exact opposite. I spend 99.9% of the game hunting critters, so I look forward to the other stuff. Stomping out fires, feeding Chally, playing music for the party etc.
---
I did. FYI can't get my in game mic to work right. So if I don't talk it's not you, it's me. Well it's bethesda really.
---
have they changed pets so they spawn with your camp now? ages ago it used to be they had to travel all the way from their original spawn point to your camp when you joined a world.
---
what are things to keep in mind when taming stuff? what can kill them?
---
...oh...
---
buying from a player vendor did count when  I did it
---
Nice pics bro, but I got a question. Do u have to be specifically invited to public test servers or something? Idk I just been wondering how everyone talks about having access to them but nobody talks about how to access them.
---
Yea it sucks, maybe in one wasteland it'll be a hidden addition hopefully
---
It'd probably just be easier to accept the fact that you're playing a game with a fairly standard RPG and Survival game system.....
---
Inventory management. It's a pretty easy system to get a handle on. You don't need to keep everything. Done. 
---
Because even if you get a stash increase..... Shortly after you'll want another..... And another....
---
I buy a lot of the skins that come out on the atom shop so I can say with confidence that if the skin changes the appearance of the PA, it can be applied to any PA. If the skin only changes the color and or appearance of an existing PA (examples being northern lights for T-51 and the ones from NW) then they will only work for those. The Red Scare can and will override any PA parts even if they are mix matched.
---
Edit: It was probably confusing the way I worded that but basically if it's a color swap, assume it only works for that armor unless stated otherwise, if it's a model swap, it should work on all of them.
---
Thank you 🥰
---
all good. i never use the in game chat anyway. sorry i had to swap characters for the gat plasma
---
whered ya go? haha
---
Nope. You have to craft a new jetpack with the skin. It's not just applied to na existing jetpack. So you need the jetpack plan for your pa to make it
---
You'll just complain and want it up to 1200 shortly after. 
---
200 additional stash space for hoarders? That's what? A few heavy weapons.
---
Ohhh I thought you left lmao. I'll get back on
---
It would, or I could use a mule for my collections because you know some people want to collect weapon varieties, or...Bethesda can increase an arbitrary stash weight to 1000. Don’t see how that’s an issue
---
My base is on a ledge with no access unless you jump 60 ft down off the cliff ledge above. Never had anything spawn but did have a scorched take pot shots from above (minimal damage). Saved a ton of CAMP space by not needing turrets or any defensive barriers.
---
My favourite is leaving rabbit plushies built up as walls.
---
They are always at camp, usually enjoying a walk around the c.a.m.p tool.
---
If the tool is inside they are at very high risk of dying (or so the internet says), as the camp basically spawns on them.
---
I am not expert enough to give a full guide, but random enemies attacking your camp can hurt them...a lvl 21 deathclaw (can't tame higher apparently) will lose about 5/10% of health while (easily) killing three random lvl 5 liberators.
---
enjoy, happy belated.
---
Happening to me rn
---
I just immediately killed myself with it. Never had one of these. Thank you so much! Never had anyone give me anything this nice in the game before.
---
Why optimize your build for xp when Zenimax sells you scrolls to make the GRIND faster!?
---
Had the same exact issue. Keep at steam and Bethesda equally. Took me a few days to resolve but it eventually does
---
I highly recommend learning some camp glitches to make building easier. Blueprinting objects that won't place correctly, destroying conduits so wires run through walls, etc...
---
ooooh thank you for this, i will proceed to buy the power armor then. i just got a little worried cuz if the red scare is only a skin, it would only apply to "that" type of power armor but i cant find that power armor in the fallout 76 wikia. 
---
it makes sense that it will override the appearance of any power armor.
---
thanks so much for explaining to me :D
---
Is it? I am not deny it, but i can make more chars just for junk stash, etc.
---
I can just for shits and giggles make a lot of chars, just for that purpose, and f1st account. So not only junk is unlimited to the power of unlimited, but regular stashes some what as well, its just PITA to transfer insude account.
---
You have a point tho.
---
get fireproof and that should help a bit.
---
Only the shishkebab works on npcs
---
damn... i thought they will already provide you with the whole thing XD
---
Goddam commies dropping giant nikes on our sacred land!
---
I didn't get my Bloodied build settled until around level 150ish.
---
You're on the right track for Unyielding gear.  For perks, if she's indeed going to go the Stealth Rifleman/Commando route, [a perk setup like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f333fb&amp;d=sg2sf2eh2ce0ir2am2a04l71lt2lu2la2an2ao0a72p02pd2pk2pl2pp2cu0cr0) is what you want to go for.  Mutations, you want
---
* Adrenal Reaction
---
* Eagle Eyes
---
* Bird Bones
---
* Speed Demon
---
* Scaly Skin
---
* Grounded
---
* Herd Mentality
---
* Carnivore or Herbivore
---
You could take Egg Head too if you want the INT boost for more XP, Marsupial if you want the jump height.  In a full set of Scout Armor, my DR is something well up around 450ish for both physical and energy damage resistances, more when in a group due to Strange In Numbers.  If you put a Dense mod on your chestpiece, you could lower Fireproof to Rank 2 or even Rank 1, in order to make room for a QoL perk like Aquaboy/girl and Radicool for more STR (if you were to only have Fireproof at R1 - Dense is 50% already, so that'd be 65% total reduction from fire and explosions).
---
For the Legendary effects themselves, other than Unyielding on all pieces, try for AP Refresh on most of them, with Poison Resistance on at least one.  Last effect is up to personal preference, but I roll with Food/Drink/Chem Carry Weight reduction so I don't have to use Traveling Pharmacy and Thru-Hiker (and thus put those 6 perk points elsewhere).
---
I agree with most things here and I think I said earlier that yes, profit isn't a margin for quality. (But that's kind of beyond the topic of the thread) The one thing I didn't agree with out of this is the mentality that 'If you purchase something, you're telling the people making it that you want more of it' - I hear this parroted a lot and think it's frankly pretty silly.   
---
How can you reasonably criticize something without owning it? Of course, there's a cut off point that every person has to assign themselves, but I've purchased the odd thing from the ATX, some I liked, some I did not - If I did not? I alongside thousands of other purchasers were very, very vocal about our dislike. And as a result? The product was changed. (See Screaming Eagle)
---
Devs listen to voices, Devs understand the basic principle that repeatedly screwing over your clientele will drive them away. We have a direct pipeline to developers in this industry. They hear about things they did well and things they didn't. If they change? People are satisfied. If they don't, they lose business. I sure as heck wasn't going to look at anymore weapon skins after the Eagle blunder.
---
oh so its a specific jetpack? damn i also thought you'll just apply the skin to an existing one, thats kinda sad but still gonna buy it probably
---
Which platform do you play on? 
---
I’m on PS4 and have a bunch of extra plans for PA pieces...you’re welcome to a set to get you started.
---
was afraid of that :(
---
least im not alone, thanks for replying
---
Yeah so if you're using the t60 you need the plan for the t60 jet pack. Then you have to craft a new one. It sucks cuz I've got my jetpack in an arm and you can't do that anymore haha, so I'll be stuck with the standered jetpack unless they change it
---
If they're dropping less is it possible that they could be part of the BoS return and a currency? Is Beth so sinister as to phase them out slowly ahead of time.... 
---
...Illuminati confirmed...
---
Thanks for your input, I figured it was either bugged or limited, oh well, I’ll just use the flamer to melt bad guys.
---
I see, thanks. I should probably look into it, been ages since I tried taming something.
---
one last thing, can players still kill your pets?
---
Happy pie day!!
---
But why friend, I only have a melee
---
As far as I know season1 end is at 10.september
---
When the season changes , does the board change completely?
---
I also RP as a raider. My vendors are jam packed with all kinds of free items, including stuff like 3 star junkies/bloodied/uny/bol. The catch is that my vendors are behind level 0, 1, and 3 locked doors.
---
I thought it would be an intresting way to force wanted status onto people, but either nobody has ever figured out that the vendors are behind those locked doors or nobody wants to be wanted.
---
Yea. New rewards ect ect.
---
She has explosive resistance.  It does absolutely nothing to her.
---
i know its 2 months late but this is exactly what happened to me just now and neither steam nor bethesda will acknowledge
---
I had a level 21 visit my camp and seem really interested in checking it all out. Used my rad shower and bought some shotgun shells from me. 
---
I was cleaning out my stash and noticed I had a lvl 25 2 star submachine gun that I was going to scrip, figure he might get some use out of it. So I ran over and dropped it and 200 rounds of ammo then stood in front of it with the gift emote. 
---
He had his back turned to me though so I pulled out my handmade and shot at the dufflebag a few times, to get his attention.
---
My shooting must have spooked him into thinking I was attacking because he bolted from my camp like a sprinter in the Olympics. Complete with zig zag pattern and occasional jumps.
---
I stood there watching him scurry off, with my pitiful gift sitting unseen on the concrete and wished there was an easier way to go from team only chat to area chat without going to settings.
---
Alright thanks
---
Need to level up? Make a new character and level up one level per day until you are level 5. Or go 2-5 lvl in 30 min for the level up three times weeklie.
---
What platform are you on? I could take a couple of you if you want? I can give you .45 in return i thin i have around 10k and I'm ps4 btw.
---
I remember first time doing leader of the pack, I got the first wolf and some lvl 340-something took the last two and beat the final wolf.
---
And that mole miner is practicing his speech after being rejected from art school :)
---
I usually do them if I am in the area and doesn't cost me too many caps to join, but I like your suggestion. Upvoted.
---
I think Pacifist mode prevents that, or it should... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't think Earle's daughter even mentioned nukes. it was entirely the mc's idea.
---
Hahaha. Sounded like my first time trying to help. I dropped some ammo and shot at the bag/ground and they FT away so I picked it up followed them and did it again and he left the server. I felt bad that I spooked them enough that they left.
---
Haven't tested it in a while, but the flamers power attack used to work with the friendly fire perk. So you have to bash friends with it instead of shooting them
---
I’d honestly just buy stock on some modules. You’ll get plenty of legendsries from meat week
---
I’ll give that a try!  Thank you!
---
If you don’t have time, that’s understandable, but then either leave or try afking in a private server and see where that gets you
---
Don't delete de character. Use it for Flatwoods Responders first two quests and the next 2 days, leveling one level per day. Faster than redoing from the beginning. New shit character every 3 days.
---
You are wise to ask. Bethesda is notoriously vague on details for just about every item in the atom store.
---
I live in Michigan so there aren't many big spiders.  Plus I hate spiders so that's another reason. Can
---
You better wait until you need to retake from enemies. Just one wave and all enemies already there. Harder to bug the spawn point.
---
I believe they mentioned a 2 week break between seasons
---
The whole idea of nuke dropping in general is stupid.  If I could choose what to do, I would destroy all silo sights permanently.
---
Yeah sadly you have to bask npcs with a flamer to get it to work. Which is a huge bummer
---
AFK piano in my case. At least they have music.
---
Yeah!  The perk card even has a picture of a flamer on it lol
---
Then we would have trouble aiming.
---
I don't even care, I'm gonna get me that chicken coop or die trying
---
Are they all online on 1 server at the same time? Not.
---
Stuff your own inventory with unique notes and holotapes and see how fast it works compared to empty. Now multiply that by every player on the server. Getting really unstable there. Now double it to account for increased storage capacity. 
---
Junk is limited to a small selection of items that are then assigned quantities. It's not the same as storing multiple unique items and keeping track of them for each player on the server. Basically, (item)*100 is very different from a 100 unique items. That applies to every unique legendary roll that would be in people's stashes.
---
You might also want to look into [Stimpak Diffusers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stimpak_diffuser).
---
didnt even see that lmao
---
He’s confirmed to come out when ever the brotherhood come here he’s been hiding in a bunker under watoga and still is atleast that’s what I’ve seen but this guy is one of the main reason Maxon knows about the taggerdys thunder failure
---
That's about what I have her set up with so far, just a pain in the ass that she has to move around so many perks
---
Good point. They really should buff the pistols and bows and the tommy guns  by 300% base damage to scale to the perk/effect nerfs they want to implement. Otherwise the weapons should be removed as non-viable.
---
its nice efficient tagging weapon even on huge distances. I like it when need all xp on events.
---
If you are on pc i can show you how to glitch inside a power connector.
---
Magic weapons? Anyone maybe want to highlight me what these are and how they work? Thanks
---
I’m 610 and still get at least one a day. I’m not sure where the wall is but I’ve got friends at 800+ that don’t have an issue.
---
Its after the run mate, its not completely integral to progression or anything, I really doubt they would extend the run just for people who complete it, if they dont make the daily challenges reward atoms afterwards, its a fairly decent idea
---
how would they know their is rewards behind the door?
---
The perk works with the Flamer and Shishkebab for healing other players. If you want to heal NPCs, the Shishkebab still works like you expect it to, whereas the only way to do that with the Flamer is to bash them. Since that is much slower and takes more AP, the Shishkebab is really the only useful weapon to use with that perk.
---
Bethesda is just goofing with these quests and events. They don't even care about common sense anymore, and this is why people keep crying NV whenever Bethesda makes a Fallout game.
---
They’re already punishing us because previously they auto deleted our duplicate perk cards that we now need or trade in for perk coins. They also are punishing us for any perk point moves we made while leveling or trying new builds. I guess what I’m saying is we’re kind of used to it lol
---
People stay away as they see workshops as PvP areas and don't want to risk it.
---
I play on console, so I couldn't possibly do this in twenty minutes due to the loading screens. My record is probably about 40 minutes, with half of that time spent loading.
---
honestly the fashnacht bot has come in clutch for alcohol and prewar food, and gum, and candy.
---
the boss drops loot? when I did it the boss died and just vanished and I did a good amount of damage to it, I got two legendaries how ever
---
well, cancelling and resubbing works, they charged my card this time and it works so thanks for reaching out
---
Why did I read that in a total snob condescending voice lol
---
A technique that reliably works is to start drumming, then open up photo mode, and then rubber band your controller to keep the camera moving.
---
2nd up for the ammo converter. if you haven't gotten it, i'd grab it. Really makes 2mm EC ammo easy to get and is much more effective than making it imo.
---
Make it feel more like Fallout and less like the SIMS
---
Source? I follow the datamining discord and nothing at all has been said about Moreno.
---
What sense does this make? If you aren't interested in those currencies, just don't log on. You're already "forced" to log on to get those currencies anyway! You have to sell stuff, cash in your treasury notes, scrip your legendaries, etc. So why on Earth would you care if there were another way to get some, if you already don't care enough about the game to log on to get them the other way(s)?
---
I have been playing since launch, and before this month I was attacked once at a workshop. This month I'm attacked daily. I want resources but it's becoming difficult, I don't want to pvp in adventure, ever.
---
I would come help others for more resources, some of the events do give resources but not enough of what I really need.
---
Gattling guns are great for trash mobs. But their dps on bosses leaves a lot to be desired. I've got bffr, jffr, vffr, and muffr versions of every ballistic heavy as well as flamers and ult gat lasers. I have done lots of testing haha
---
no actually camp defenses are going to scale down, to the point that a bloatfly can take on 10 missle turrets and pwn em.
---
Thanks for the info, I had the extra points and figured it would be fun to try since I love the flamer anyway, but I guess it’s just to good to be true :)
---
Be careful with DR as it starts having noticeably diminishing returns after around 350. https://imgur.com/a/Q5ntmvE    
---
And more here https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Damage_Reduction_formula
---
I guess Lou wasn't up for the job.
---
go to your map. open challenges. scroll down to world. scroll down to possum. 
---
also the campfire tales can award them but i got 2 out of about 40 events. An apparently the insect parts quest can as well. but i did ab out 30 of those and got none.
---
I could take em off your hands (Xbox 1)
---
I actually think the damage remodel might fix the bug, I’ve also lost a couple thousand rounds to it
---
if you're on xbone i can give you a legendary shishkebab if you want. stars may not be great but whatevs
---
With PA displays I have a filling they might add this soon
---
TBH I'd be ok with the damage nerf if it would fix this annoying piece of crapula
---
It's as if we're not talking about fallout 76 where there are no scrolls and intellect points affect XP gain...
---
Is this using VATS?
---
Thanks for the offer, I believe we’ve traded before, I recognize your name from the trading sub, I’ve actually got a nice junkies one but thank you very much for the kind offer!
---
Because that was his name before he turned.
---
Stings &amp; things and Operation tidy are the easiest way to get them.
---
Yep
---
It could be something different,  but the same thing happens with about 20% of melee attacks. Damage shows but no health loss is ever registered. Also the rubber banding of enemies health is still around and sometimes extremely brutal. I have had time where damage would take the enemy all the way down to next to nothing then jump back up to over half health multiple timeson the same target before being able to finally kill it. Both of these issues have been around since beta and Bethesda does not care about them. Hopefully your issue isn't another new damage bug.
---
Thank you. Im on PS4 so I haven't done the quest yet.
---
You have to complete the Order of the Tadpole questline before you can start earning possum badges. If you have done it, then you can do the 2 repeatables for the Scout leaders and Campfire Tales for a chance at badges, or you can do the possum challenges in your challenges list.
---
Np good luck. It's meat week anyway so try to enjoy they above all else! If you need to store junk or weapons since you don't have the first stash I can help.
---
Thank you. PTS was random invitation only but the last few months it's been open to anyone on PC who has the space to install the game twice on their computer as it runs a completely different version. You can download it via the Bethesda launcher.
---
Theres a little prequest you can do by speaking to a girl named Maggie Williams in Foundation. Once the patch drops for you console players, all will be revealed.
---
Yea, i'm all aware of it. But personally, on PS4, i didn't get alot of toxic encounters on public workshops. But even like it is right now, even if they were pve only, as a veteran, public workshops don't even worth the effort. You don't gain alot from it. Some extra rewards at least would be much appreciated !
---
Should probably re-read your own op then.
---
The unfortunate reality is when it comes to AAA game development, numbers matter more than opinions.  If a game is making money, that's usually a sign the developers are doing something correct as far as revenue is concerned.  When you have something like Fallout 1st where you can pay monthly, or subscribe in advance, it definitely opens a situation where you're indirectly supporting whatever decisions the developers make regardless how you personally feel.  Especially if you pay a potential year in advance.  
---
This would also apply to a season pass for DLC that hasn't even been announced and fully described yet.  You're paying for basically a vague promise that may or may not be what you like, but regardless you're paying for the development and whatever quality (or lack of) it ends up being.  For something like Atoms, it's less money, but the overall message is still clear that at the very least it's something people want more of and like when they buy it.
---
I'm confused, are you asking me how I critique something without owning it as a lead-in to your experience, or are asking a general question how anybody could critique something without owning it? If the former, I guess you can ignore my next paragraph, if the latter, then I'd say "quite easily".  You do your research on that thing, and you can determine through that research its faults and strengths, and how it performs.  
---
It's *very* possible and easy to be critical of something you don't own, admittedly, some people don't do their research before critiquing something, but if you're a customer who prefers to make informed purchases on something like games, we have videos, articles, and a host of other resources including other player experiences to do so.
---
I know Bethesda does listen to things, but I also know that around a year and a half after release, Bethesda has very unusual, if not undesirable ways of prioritizing how they operate.  
---
The thing is though, developers that do listen in a game like this, also are more likely to listen to whoever is paying, or rather, whenever it's cutting into their bottom line.  That you bring up a microtransaction skin kind of proves my point, because I would be very surprised if most microtransaction issues, or Fallout 1st issues weren't rectified more swiftly probably because they know people are paying.  They make note of other smaller issues, but it's clear they're never handled with the same haste.
---
Yeah this bug sucks. I've heard its related to the fact that your stealth damage is not actually being applied. It works fine with manual aim, I just avoid using VATS on boss fights now. I don't know if there is a fix, but would love if there is.
---
That is how ESO works.
---
seriously. I joined during wastelanders and I'm already level 200, already that's way higher than any level I've ever been before in any past Bethesda game like Skyrim or fallout 4 and I play those damn things to utter completion of everything on the map 
---
when I started playing this game it just seemed like the level 200s and 300s I saw I treated it as a respectable achievement but now I just see it's just the ones who HAVE to grind levels for the battle pass, it's made leveling up such a chore and equally unsatisfying, it felt like a special thing before like a real achievement but now it's just like oh great more score
---
they 100% need to rework most of the way that challenge works for season 2, remove dailies completely, make it level up ONCE per weekly
---
plus too this is just almost requiring the whole playerbase to use full unyielding armor with a bloodied build to abuse the 30+ in every stat for intelligence, as if that wasn't already 90% of the builds in the game
---
Forgot to mention. These aren't from the PTS though. The event is out on PC already.
---
Tbh I finished it early. Just got to 100 yesterday. And I didn't pay, just used atoms from rewards along the run to level up whenever I had to skip a couple days. Still finished like 3 weeks early.
---
I love that, I'll randomly get rewards every few days cause someone cleared out the new cop a squatter location that I got that I didn't even know about.
---
Yeah i was running around looking for the boss but couldn't find the body in my first play through yesterday, I then ran as fast as I could, running past all the remaining monsters and if I had half a second left I would have got out.... But I died. So I lost my junk inside and I missed looting the boss.
---
What a total pain in the ass.
---
Find the possum/tadpole challenges in the the world section of challenges. Then start the grind have fun!
---
I'm your mirror opposite. 
---
I tell myself 'this is temporary' every time. 
---
Without fail I'll end up in 'perfect spot' with the 'perfect feel' right off and I'll never move. 
---
I even made an alt with the explicit purpose of just using him as a builder. Building something cool but then moving on to a new project...
---
Nope, the very first project I completed was so 'perfect' I just couldn't bring myself to destroy it.
---
Anyone know what the drop rate is from the dailys/event for badges I am guessing it's fairly low.
---
When released or now if you're PC, the Colossal event is a guaranteed level up pretty much, I am 212 or so and I have jumped a level with each try, always someone popping lunchboxes in the waiting area.
---
To be honest, vanilla wow, which is what I'm most familiar with, wasn't all too friendly to alts either. Sure, mail helped, but no mount or any benefits from having a high level character made it unpleasant to level up. I still did because leveling in vanilla WoW was fun. And even with that in mind, they still added heirlooms and all the other shit to encourage alts. It boggles my mind that any company that decides to release an online RPG doesn't look at what WoW did and what worked for them and what didn't. I could seriously write paragraphs worth of frustration about games being released years later with the same mistakes. Only reason I can thing of is just for the company making it to have some easy fixes lined up to get some praise for listening. Dumbfounding but I see no other reason not to learn from other's past.
---
At least on PC having any other game mode running side by side to it's current one would mean less players per server and longer load times. When I play I see the same faces and names. Other Battle Royale games that's extremely rare.
---
However I agree. I also would love to see other game modes like capture the flag or the likes. I absolutely love NW.
---
You'd think with all the blasting equipment, missile launchers and grenades laying all over the area someone would have a less apocalyptic means of opening or closing a hole in the ground.
---
oh i play on PC i cant play on PS4 anymore since my older sister is always playing T\^T
---
It's a feature.
---
And the quality of those expansions has been going down. I quit with the latest one. There's just no point. I get their vision for it, but it's just not enticing for me when my gear from 4 years ago still tops dps. Why would I bother with anything, especially considering how elitist the end game is.
---
Theres a fairly flat area just behind the red rocket on the edge of flatwoods
---
yeah its very hard to follow, they dont pretty much explain how it works or did i miss a few things? lol
---
Yinz stop been a jagoff and help him kill himself.
---
I'm not trying to compare the two. Only suggest that they look at things that worked there and why they worked before they make changes over here.
---
I’ve got the same issue. Reset 3 times within the last two weeks. I’ve narrowed it down to one of three things. 1. Joining a server without camp placement or 2. Leaving a server while someone is still buying from your vendors. 3. Still don’t have a clue.
---
I think the plan was to have new animations and a normal interface, but they were rushed to get it functional for the season. So tacked on the ugly terminal last minute.
---
You can't blueprint it. I took the one next to that giant red recoket and it just won't let me.
---
You're thinking lacks the absurdity that got the fallout universe into the mess. If you were in charge there'd be no war! If we're honest why not just reprogram motherlode?
---
I know what the op is about. Should probably re-read your comment talking about scrolls and things that don't apply to the game that is being discussed here, not the game it's being compared to as a suggestion. Again, if you got anything more to contribute other than an emoji and some snark, feel free. Otherwise, not much left to discuss for us.
---
My PC is so old that I simply can't aim without VATS, too laggy :-) 
---
Hopefully it will be fixed with the damage balance update or whatnot
---
I’ve been looking for a fix as well. I need to try more power switch variations or just give up because, bethesda...
---
Agreed, but I make The Overseer pay. Every time I have to visit her, I loot everything that's lootable. And I even get a Pumpkin Pie from time to time. While not a treasure trove, The Overseer's house does have a fair amount of scrap, and I just wish that it was possible to play The Overseer's accordion.
---
Congrats on the victory, sounds like it was a fun time!
---
September 22 is another bonus meat week if we complete the Boss challenge.
---
Well it'd be an organic way to introduce legendary power armor. But you wouldn't even have to necessarily use scorched or some other creature type: if you remember the medic armor from 3 it had an ability to administor a lethal injection if the occupant was attempting to desert, it could be a fully conscious npc stuck in there that doesn't want to die. Another plot point is they could finally give us more info on mole miners; I'm reasonably sure I'm not the only one that's noticed a weirdly large number of the ash heap miners drop toys as loot..
---
Yes I am livel 97 and only 2 times I meet griefers
---
Which part is batshit - the part where I mentioned a joke my friend made that I said I didn't agree with, or the part where I said that Bethesda is basically ignoring players?
---
Yes at the Abbie bunker but we don't find her body so maybe She Is still alive
---
Oh I was just thinking about going to harpes ferry and kill all of the enemies pick up the loot and the sell them to the vendor and server hop repeat but selling purified water sounds also nice not sure if I have the plan.
---
Yup. The difference comes out to how the game ends up designed, and how predatory it is
---
The Gauss Shotgun is KING.
---
Don't want to spoil it for you, BUT roll a better gun. And not bloodied or Junkies. And SACTTERSHOT is NOT the perk you looking for :)
---
Maximizing profit with as little effort as possible has always been Bethesda’s way, they sure won’t waste their time testing their broken additions before they implement them into the game
---
Yesterday when I did it, I think I died to some falling debris after he died. Respawned outside to nearly get killed by rads. 
---
Today, I did die again. This time I repawned inside the cave at least. He wasn't dead yet. The run outside was nuts cause I was over loaded with crap. (247 inert flux weighs a fair amount.. didn't realize I had that much on me till after the event.) This time I was looking out for the rumored "loot chest" that I missed out on yesterday. I saw a box towards the end, but I'm still not sure if that was even it. I had about 7 wendigos chewing on my ass so I didn't really have the time to process what was even in it. It was in a little alcove just before the a square room near what I assume is the exit. Not sure I even made it to the exit as I was hit with a loading screen shortly after looting the chest.
---
The hectic run to get out is kinda neat, but I don't like not being able to loot the kills. Or being overloaded and trying to run out.
---
I was going to ask if you know anyone that sells the serums but you’re on pc right?
---
A lot of people abusing the new god mode glitch keep coming to my camp and picking every lock and trying to fight the whole server at my vendor.
---
Yeah, because false advertising is okay.
---
Campfire tales event also have the potential to grant them
---
Halloween candy does have weight, it's just so small the crappy UI doesn't show it, same with Bobby pins. You got to have a lot to notice.
---
I don’t know if I agree with the “our weekly atoms statement.” Honestly, I never did those challenges, because they were just...stupid (IMO obviously). These current challenges may be tedious. They may feel like a second job sometimes, but I’m just glad I no longer have to complete “level while naked” ever again. Besides, that jangles backpack is too dope...an I didn’t pay a dime other than my time😏.
---
Yeah, but my comments don't claim otherwise. I feel like you're presuming my comments are defending the developers or management.  
---
So allow me to be absolutely clear. Inexperience, poor morale, inefficient workflow, zero quality standards, abysmal quality control, and insulting customer relations are ALL BAD.  
---
My intent was to point out where in the chain this process was fucked up, **not** that it **wasn't** fucked up. But in the weight of a "bad dev" vs "management" it's 80/20. Developers that can't quickly and accurately do their work, but aren't replaced, is a failure of management. If the developer isn't inept but instead lack resources (like time) that's management's failure. If both these things are happening and there's no quality control to catch problems due to both factors then that's a failure of management to uphold standards.  
---
As a former management myself, you're responsible for your associate's failures. If the worker isn't up to snuff, YOU are still responsible for hitting quotas and metrics. I hope my stance has been made more clear. It's rotten up and down, but that place clearly needs a better business practices to root out bad management. Once you have better management, you can cull poor developers and institute better practices to retain good ones.
---
8 charisma, there is also an 8 intelligence option that AFAIK just changes his dialogue, rewards seem to be the same.
---
Did not even see him
---
LOL!   While completing it naked, no armor, and using a level 15 pipe weapon, no doubt.  :)
---
Don’t think so
---
:)
---
And it counts as completing an event for the daily and/or weekly challenges
---
I'm level 44 only been playing for a few weeks and so far I'm running a 2* junkies limb damage power fist? 
---
What would be the best perks for it as I already have my chems worked out
---
Yeah I live all over the place (active duty military). Right now I’m in Guam. There’s shitloads of spiders here especially in the more jungle areas on the south of the island, but they mostly stick to the jungle, and aren’t very venomous. The brown tree snake is an invasive species and they’ve killed off a lot of the bird population on the island. So with no natural predator and little competition for bugs to feed on the spider population has gone way up. But the worst you get around the house is a daddy long legs or maybe the occasional huntsman. Huntsman spiders aren’t very venomous but due to their sheer size their bites still have a decent pain factor.
---
User name is the most appropriate I've ever seen.
---
You know, I still haven't done that solo.   Embarrassing to admit, but I get so turned around in those silos.   If it weren't for my partners.....
---
Yes, there's a difference there, and it's a huge one. Traditionally with Bethesda Games Studios games, paying for expansions typically delivered a huge amount of content. It was a good value. But Bethesda doesn't want that anymore. They want to deliver cheap, easy and overpriced. Why spend money on making something like the Shivering Isles or Dragonborn or Nuka World when you can get people to spend money on cosmetics imported from old games and the Creation Club? Seasons is not content and events like the Colossal Problem are just Fallout-themed carnival rides. They aren't quality Fallout experiences.
---
Ran him 12 times in the past two days. Got a unicorn weapon as a drop and all unique drops less the helmet so far. The event itself is fun although nerve wrecking for me(I have this spawn glitch 100% of the time so I can not die at all). Despite people's objection to how the event ends I like that too.
---
Ah, redditors last resort when they have nothing else to say, yet still feel like they have to say something.
---
Finding the signed exit can be tricky, once you find that getting out isnt too bad, done it last three times with time to loot bonus junk chest.
---
Something to do with lemonade I think. I keep meaning to do a shishkebab giveaway as I have about 7 of then but I cannot find time.
---
Numbers and opinions aren't mutually exclusive, the number of people that cry out are usually proportional to the amount of people that purchased. That doesn't and didn't stop outcry from changing things.   
---
Again, I still disagree. Purchasing something does not mean you actively support every vaguely related decision or piece of content and I know for a fact that devs don't look at numbers and say 'Wow, guess they really like the game' - Developers don't think like that, management does. And the devs are going to be the ones cleaning up 76's messes and building new content, the only things of any relevance to the consumer.   
---
Again, developers couldn't care less about money unless they're told to. They get paid a wage and don't have to report numbers to Bethesda. If you were speaking directly to a game director, I would agree. But you're not. Complaints go to the team, not the messenger to Zenimax who counts dollars.   
---
Yes, I would hope that things you paid for would be swiftly rectified. You're actively putting money down on them. Free content \*should\* be secondary to them. And as for the 'Money means I support this' - I some cases, it's true and should be true. For instance, if a particular camp item or outfit sells incredibly well? Obviously the message there would be 'Clearly they like the style of this item, we'll make more' - But to suggest that developers knowingly look at a broken, buggy skin, see it sold and say 'Well gee, guess they like broken, buggy things, let's make more' is mental.
---
The 8 intelligence dialogue choice only is an option if you bring him the photos. You talk him into paying more. When I sell the pictures to the raiders or the settlers and go back to Davenport I only get two dialogue options. Tell him I sold them to someone else or tell him I’ll get back to him which just leaves the quest unfinished until I tell him I sold them to someone else. If you finish the quest by telling him that you sold the pictures he yells at you but you still get xp and 3 treasury notes.
---
A good idea is if your'e near the exit throw up a follow me emote as you would with legendary in the Uranium fever event.
---
Oh yeah, once you find the exit sign it's smooth sailing from there but finding the exit sign itself is difficult. I think they should have a bigger brighter sign or just put a wave marker at the exit.
---
No, she outright tells the player to nuke the mine to dislodge the rocks. And yeah, nuking the entire area to dislodge some rocks is insane.
---
Hey. Do you know the drop rate on these weapons? I have the pickaxe, but no idea if it rare. From what I see on reddit it seems like it will drop regularly.
---
I think the reason they didn't is because the cores can be somewhere between full and empty, so it would be awkward to do.
---
The writing in Fallout series has gone to shit since Fallout 4... So many immersion breaking quests in F4 and absolutely no immersion in F76. I get so sad thinking about what this game could have been... :\[
---
Ahhhh ha
---
when you fast travel to huntersville, turn around and face the floaters. that‘s where the BoS grave is.
---
First of what build are you using, how much damage and, were you alone?
---
Good memory!  Yes it was!
---
Yes this, I don't worry too much about DR beyond 350. Ran at 450+ for ages, but since swapping out my Heavy Combat Armor and dropping down just below 400 I haven't really experienced a noticeable difference.
---
Guess my advice is that once you hit \~350DR don't sacrifice good legendary perks for even higher DR.
---
I want to prepare. What do I need to have for Meat Week?
---
Unless the challenge specially mentions another player, you can make your own group and it counts toward completion of the challenge. The issue I had with events is that they didn't come up all that often, the only two that were somewhat persistent on the map were The Messenger (ugh) and the go kill a bunch of horny Mirelurks event both seem to take forever to complete because the pathing for the robot and horny mirelurks is crap.
---
Yeah I got the log cabin bundle for free like this.
---
I can hardly see anything....
---
You have emergency protocols on?
---
Hey man I hadn't even done one with a group haha. Now at level368 I've still only launched 1
---
I tested both of my builds on assaultron head beam laser and my health was dropping so fast with full health but not with low health builds, I’m wondering if a low health with emergency protocol be more tanky than a full health junkies?
---
Yes I do. I know it reduces 50% damage received but it feels like I’m even more tanky than I’m doing full health
---
Next time I do it I'll take a compass bearing, should help
---
Yup all alone and stealth commando build tyr build video you can find the same build I use
---
And about 1300 -1500 with stealth and buffs
---
I’m sure it’s a bloodied stealth commando and you need to be on the right drugs and stuff be full on food for extra buffs and all that
---
I just wish they reworked gear and perks with all the useless shit that's there into something more streamlined. You, me and a comparatively small handful know and get things like this, but to an average player this is all rocket science. Give us perks that get multiplied by sets or something to guide players into a build, not leave them looking for shit online and ending up with an awfully poor attempt at a bloodied build when you're level 40 and have very little grasp on anything in the game. Fuck, 8 year old me had an easier way navigating WoW gear than I have now in this game. That's just wrong.
---
Wrong sub pal
---
My character is bloodied heavy pa build
---
It's totally unsustainable. Basically you need to keep a character slot free and do it with a new character. The fastest way to do it is to join a friend at a workshop. Then trade with them so you get money to take over the workshop. Doing that should level you up. That's how I used to do it during the Atoms for challenges days when it was a "level up while" challenge. Now I usually just join public teams and fast travel around the map to do it. I like easy.
---
Shiiiiiiiz
---
Can my post still chill on here 😬
---
Im level 230 and struggling a bit now. Its doable but takes more effort than i care baout at this point. Im only 5 squares away form being done. I should probably just make a new character and delete it after
---
What's with all these dark as fuck pictures, do carrots need a sales boost?
---
That task is easy to achieve if the events such as Line in the Sand popping up while you are playing. Sometimes I had to give up the leveling part due to the limited time I could play. But I think it is not hard to finish that task every other day.
---
Rule 10
---
It's honestly super fun! I hope u get to try it siim
---
I cant solo one but gg
---
Ppl actually read the rules 🤦‍♂️
---
The higher you are the harder it gets,  I think its 160xp extra for every lvl,  so roughly 8000xp for lvl50
---
16k for 100 and so on... So might be better to make a new one....
---
High intelligence helps alot then add egg head mutation XD plus team bonus and mutation team bonus.  Then maybe farm the food buffs
---
And a magic gun?
---
30 minutes? When I made my first character I spent almost 2 hours crafting my alter ego's appearance, adjusting the nose to chin ratio, getting the eyes just right. The problem being that a lot of the choices for things like hair styles just look plain ridiculous. I mean does anyone ever actually use The Megaton? or stick a shamrock tattoo on their face? In almost 2 years of playing this game I don't think I've ever seen either in the wild.
---
No? Just keep emergency protocols on your chest. Then if your junkies gets down to 20%hp you will have the same defense as your bloodied
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if he’s from my faction. One of our members loves doing events naked. We’ve given up asking why.
---
Nope b25 fixer
---
Nope you'll be taken down shortly
---
Yup exactly
---
I doubt it
---
Stay and kill adds, I never made it out on one run and it just dropped me outside at the end
---
Yea I’ve always wanted to try solo but I get bored plying alone lol
---
I play melee, non-bloodied, with only martial arts, incisor and bloody mess. I hold my own almost everywhere and I'm hopeless at computer games.
---
Fallout 76 is easy enough that ALL builds are viable. It's just a couple that destroy everything in one hit.
---
I like this. I need to learn this chair sinking kung fu.
---
An addon to hide the secret service jetpack. Check the nexus
---
The only thing I have not seen here so far is specialization is more rewarding.
---
You get exponentially more progress the more of an item you turn in at once. 
---
If you grab one green at a time and turn it in you will get less total progress than collecting 30 and turning them all in at once by about a factor of 2, even if it takes the same amount of time, the same goes for the meat bits. I think you get the most per item turning in stacks of 15+
---
So fighting over one job with others or doing multiple jobs at once is less rewarding than having each person do a single specific thing. The exception is turning the spits/ drums where having more people at once is better.
---
The rep gain from this quest is so little that it's literally not worth the time to do it. I've done it twice and can't be bothered anymore.
---
Probably because of the backlash they got when they introduced ATOM Shop Vault boy standees into the game awhile back. They pulled them in a hot second after the player community complained.
---
eh with a charge of 1-100% you just get a price of say 5 ammopoints for one that is at 1 percent so 50% would be 250 points 100% is 500 points etc.
---
Sad to say, but I don't think it's 2  
---
The first time it happened, I opened up my stash and watched all my inventory get thrown into it.   
---
Second time it happened, I was wondering why my vendors were on but didn't have the Vendor tag on the map. walked through my front door and noticed all display cases were empty.
---
Can I assume full health build has 40% more health than a low health build with emergency protocol? Emergency protocol reduce 50% damage received is like double up the 20% health to 40%, can I conclude it like that?
---
I feel ya I just like doing solo queens and that’s it really alone lol
---
Well, I skimmed it while tired so didn't get the joke, but the idea that this is malice rather than incompetence is still pretty far fetched. They're demonstrably not ignoring players, but theyre not exactly putting a lot of thought into their work either
---
Cannibal oddly still works with Herbivore Mutation. I have Herbvirore and run 2 ranks of Cannibal, 4 or 5 uses and im back to full hunger
---
'Catch the greased up deaf guy' Event.
---
Damn I dont run food buffs, and my BE15r auto  handmade only does like 1500 damage per hit on normal enemies
---
The bots challenge is also instantly easier once you’ve completed mayor for a day in watoga. The only one you’ll be missing is the sentry bot which you’ll find by doing The event Battle Bots in the Ash Heap.
---
Yea I’ll feel you I do the same I’m starting to get into pvp now a bit since I can’t do that new event yet
---
Vampire‘s gatling plasma/(gauss) minigun/gatling laser and suddenly you are the tank. We got all the tools.
---
Yeah I know, that's what i would expect, but based on every fuck up they've made so far it would be way to complex for these monkeys to implement properly.
---
are all the items in atomic shop limited or there others that are permanent?
---
Loot all the screws!
---
Time zones are hard. We'll done op
---
Different time zones my dude. Wait until reset atleast
---
And a new map!  NW needs love all around
---
Crutch
---
Why would you pay people to test things for you when you have players from the community literally offering to do it for free? Hell, this is what public test builds are for these days (and it's not just Bethesda who uses their community to do their QA testing for them, this is quickly becoming an industry standard).
---
What's baffeling is that even with thousands of people playtesting shit for free, they still don't manage to fix anything.
---
Cant you just press "r" and turn autofill off?
---
They day starts at noon ET. Naturally.
---
It just works.
---
Thanks for sharing, well it's still a farming method, so I am not going to downvote you, even tho I don't use glitches. But I feel like right now with Colossal Problem giving you at least 2 3-star legendaries (oftenly even 3 3-star) farming legendaries became so irrelevant. Especially since scrip limit is still 150.
---
What kind of calendar doesn't account for fucking time zones? Come on...
---
I know how time zones work, but apparently Bethesda doesn't.
---
is fixed now, but ty for the offer!
---
What kind of player doesn't understand the daily reset times. Come one.
---
Lvl 640 here, totally agreed. It's a matter of proper high int build and maintaining couple xp buffs (like cranberry relish 25% bonus or well rested one) all the time which is quite easy to achieve.
---
Also, now we have lunchboxes and considering we have them at the pts sold for gold boullion @ 100gb ea, I guess levelling will become even easier with the next patch.
---
I don't even take in consideration that higher level mobs with one wasteland update will also yield much higher xp amount (tested it by myself, was getting about 814xp from a lvl 100 super mutant at pts). Double that if you and 3 of your friends open 1 lunchbox each.
---
Also, if someone does not want to level up, they always can get 500 score via repeatable, 50000xp is not that hard to get.
---
You need about that amount at level 313 to level up. If you're much higher level, it's always easier to just do a repeatable 5 times instead of level up daily challenge.
---
It says the 20th, today is the 20th. It should be double score at reset.
---
You're part of the reason why there's a damage nerf incoming. 
---
I wouldn't be overly proud of this.
---
Bethesda "allows" mods but doesn't support them yet. The text chat mod is on a separate server as it's not connected in any way to bethesda's worlds.
---
I can't believe I have to explain this, seriously.
---
The official calendar... made by Bethesda... shows the event as live when it actually isn't. In what world is this problem caused by me?
---
Id just delete this post tbh.
---
People keep spending money on the game regardless. Do you honestly expect Bethesda to change their ways if this doesn't?
---
If the player base refused to spend money on MTX until Bethesda consistently works on fixing issues first time, with proper testing and all that, you watch how quickly Bethesda changes their behaviour to get that cash.
---
Double Score starts with today's daily challanges. Since the yesterday's ones are still available it means the double score isn't active yet. It will be when the dailies reset. As always...
---
Damn you really like to hear yourself talk huh , definitely worth my time 🤣
---
I offer one removal
---
I am absolutely amazed at the lengths you people go to to defend Bethesda's mistakes.
---
It's a calendar. They know the time and date this shit is supposed to go live. They can program the damn thing to update at the exact time the event goes live. This is not rocket science, okay? Instead they do what they usually do and take the lazy approach, and apparently I'm the crazy one for calling them out on that.
---
This community is amazing. Absolutely amazing.
---
So you miss 500 score every few days... What's the big deal?
---
And to think there are players and teams who launch multiple every day.
---
It's more that you feel the work revolves around you. When it changes for everybody. The game is not going to update at midnight for every time zone. The game always has done stuff for the day at the daily reset. You are just coming across extremely entitled
---
Exchange treasury notes, and chase other players in a clown outfit with the Pint sized mask and a flaming chainsaw.
---
Post your time post PTS nerf :-)
---
Opinions only matter if the bottom line is affected.  Whether that's negative reception that could affect sales, or actual dwindling sales/interest.  But find a big enough name, and you'll find they continually ignore feedback at their own peril and come out fine because the numbers speak more than the opinions provided they're large enough.
---
It's probably not done with malicious intent, but it's very clear that when the developers make something, they probably don't test their own content, or perhaps even play their own game since it's been obvious at times if something is broken right from the get-go, which would have been obvious if the content had been tested more thoroughly, or they played the game themselves.  In that regard, they might in fact, knowingly have to release something untested.
---
They aware through community proxies issues we have, and also whatever earns money.  They coordinate with their upper management and whoever else above them, and will be complicit in whatever they're told is the direction the game should take in order for whatever is determined to be most gainful.  If they communicate well, and deliver high quality content, the relationship to their playerbase should be positive, if they don't, then it's going to be negative.
---
I run 1 endurance, doesn’t seem to slow me down or have any detrimental effects other then not having access to a bunch of quality of life cards
---
PA has a basic dmg reduction by 7% a piece I think, so with all the pieces you get 42% dmg reduction while being full hp. With emergency protocols and low hp, it goes up to 92% (or stops at 90%, I'm not sure about that). So full health, you get 58% of the damage done to you, and low health only 8-10%. That's why it feels more tanky.
---
That sorta defeats the purpose. The people who actually work on and change arent playing it so whats the point.
---
Double score starting soon.
---
Deleting posts is for chumps.
---
But apparently the idea that the official event calendar should run in sync with the actual reset times on the server is the kind of black magic idea that the world is not ready for, so fuck me I guess?
---
Might be using the prison-type door with bars.   You can easily see the vending machines.
---
If it's easier to make a new character every day than just play the characters you actually play... that's a sign of bad design.
---
Too nice in some cases, and that's one of the reasons I got FO1st. Keep in mind this is just my perspective.
---
I like to find and learn the plans, the locations, the levels on my own. I like the struggle because it makes every level feel like an accomplishment. I don't have a mic and I generally keep area chat off so the only way for me to communicate with other players in emotes and rejecting another player's kindness feels just plain rude. While having 20 stimpacks and a cool new level appropriate weapon or armor set just drop in my lap is nice, for me, it feels as if by accepting them I'm cheating myself out of the experience.
---
But, I'll admit to a bit of hypocrisy in that I do salt the low level areas (Flatwoods, Morgantown Airport and Charleston) with small caches of stimpacks, radaway, 200% repaired weapons and armor and food and some plans that I think would be useful to new(er) players.
---
The game definitely lacks ways of playing support, especially for weapons. Medic's is the only prefix for support play and it's absolute garbage. The perks don't help that much if i want to build a support around strength, or play for "actual" buffs. I want to play support for everyone i encounter, not just sharing a limited single card for my team.
---
Thanks for your information!!! But what do you think? Is low health really more tanky than full health?
---
Dude, events always come live at reset on the date Bethesda give. 
---
Reset for me is 5pm....
---
7 hrs 20 mins or so
---
it's amusing you need to nuke it considering there's enough room between the rocks "blocking" the shaft to fit multiple ppl through.
---
Really?! Excellent! =)
---
%% say yes, it is.
---
I feel like I'm seriously living in a different reality than you or something.
---
The calendar says the event is live. Right now.
---
The event is not live. For anyone. It's not timezone dependent. The event goes live for everyone at the same time. So the calendar is wrong. How is this so hard to understand?
---
yeah, it aint that hard as everybody said at the start. i missed 5 full days bc of a short vacation and did 2 or 3 NW dailies total. now im short before 90 and the double score days are ahead, wont be any problems.
---
I just wish they would make the spawn show up where it should.  It gets reallllllllly old running around a like 20 screen radius desperately trying to find the enemies that have apparently taken over the workshop.    
---
Been like this since beta.
---
lmao.
---
I get that, but then why on earth does the calendar say it's live right now, 7 hours before it actually goes live? Why am I the only person having a problem with this?
---
For killing bots, if you want easy bots, do the liberators by Vault 76, the water treatment plant, the ag center and Arktos.
---
Thanks!! I’m struggling to prepare which build is tanky enough to do the colossal problem
---
No, he just really likes that building...
---
In short, some of the legendary effects combined with very fast fire rate cause a weapon to deal much more dmg thankt should.
---
someone make a mod that replaces the nuke launch beep with the team america song, plz
---
I've killed all the bots in Watoga many times (the atom "kill 1K+ bot" challenges), and never triggered this.   I wonder if it's a new change.   It's been a few months since I did it.
---
Is this your first live game? I don't know of any game that makes things live for every time zone. I'm done with this. You are just so far up your own you know what to understand.
---
 I'll leave you with one of my favourite quotes that I feel describes you nicely 
---
“Never play chess with a pigeon.
---
The pigeon just knocks all the pieces over.
---
Then shits all over the board.
---
Then struts around like it won.”
---
Calendars track date, Clocks track time.
---
The Date is correct, so maybe it's just clocks that are hard, for you at least?
---
I wouldn't advise playing Colossal Problem low hp. Especially if the respawn bug happens to you often. Too many poison/damage ofer time zones to risk playing low hp in my opinion.
---
Be sure to be well rested.
---
The leads are weak...
---
5/5
---
Everything except levelling up is fast. I do everything quick, switch to a new low level character and level up
---
"Shortly" 😂  
---
Are we really still pretending we have active mods here?
---
Its not always a player who opened your door. Especially if you have a companion at your camp. But even if you don't traders sometimes stop by your camp and do stuff too.
---
Canned meat stew is from Feed the People event. You get a couple for finishing it
---
Dude have you had a brain injury or something or are you just trolling at this point?
---
Sometimes the animation slow down but she doesn't appear to freeze
---
&gt; I don't know of any game that makes things live for every time zone. 
---
You are missing the point so fucking hard I can't even believe I'm having this argument.
---
The event is not live. Yes? The event won't go live for another 7 hours. Yes? So far we are in agreement.
---
Now pay attention, because this is important.
---
If *I* know the event won't go live for another 7 hours, and *you* know the event doesn't go live for another 7 hours, and *Bethesda* themselves know the event won't go live for another 7 hours...
---
Why the fuck does it say it's live right now? Or are we so far down the Bethesda rabbit hole that we just consider this kind of lazy programming normal now?
---
Ok more than 600 hours into the game i did not know this.
---
Dude must be trolling
---
Shut up you clown
---
she did that? that‘s hilarious.
---
I haven't yet, but I'm about to have a brain aneurysm from the sheer stupidity in this thread.
---
The event isn't live. The official calendar says that it is. The calendar is blatantly wrong. Why doesn't the calendar update to 'live' when the event is actually live? I feel like this is a very valid question, but apparently I've woken up in crazy land today.
---
Either he deleted his post or the mods did. That's pretty funny haha
---
Dude just stop. You're making yourself look really dumb
---
Haha
---
How do you get that?
---
Dudes just an idiot. Don't feed the trolls
---
By all means, explain to me why the calendar says 'live' when the event isn't live. This is like, the simplest of issues that you are just failing to understand...
---
 One thing that I noticed straight off the bat is that quite a few of the Raider faction daily quests take you to workshops. Rocksy's quests usually end up in one of three places Beckley Mine Exhibit, some farm in The Mire whose name I can't recall at the moment, and Berkley Springs West. Wren will often send you to Wade Airport, Grafton Steel Yard and on occasion to Mount Blair.
---
There's no real point to this post, just an observation that it seems as if they're really pushing players to take the workshops.
---
What was it? Custom isn't possible
---
There might be a cliff at 1000 but then its level after that. Or no cliff and just slowly harder to 1000 and then its always the same. Im at 400 and i level up faster then when i was 30 to be honest. Just alot more effective at knowing how valuable intelligence is. I gain xp 110% more for doing stuff without getting lunch boxes involved. Every day can be triple experience if you want.
---
No u
---
Not hard because you have played everyday except for 5, that's part of the issue people were saying, the time commitment, plus they buffed it with extra daily awards...
---
I finished it, but was like having a second job that took an hr or two each day
---
It's ok mate, I've scripped many a god roll armour pieces because I didn't know their worth :-)
---
Were you on the same server?
---
You must be new.
---
We don't do that shit here.
---
Yeah, I was same. I only learned of it a few months ago and thought I'd share :)
---
And turn off the shower
---
Pipe is life.
---
Icons can be in the atomic shop for longer time or be awarded for NW so it could be one if those.
---
Only 5 levels to go for me! Hoping to finish this double score weekend
---
You good sir are a legend 👌
---
&gt; so it might be worth checking out some player vendors to see if they have good items on offer.
---
I 2nd this suggestion. 
---
I lucked into finding a 3 star Handmade at a vendor. My jaw dropped as I saw the prefixes. Exploding rounds, +30 to scorch 90% weight reduction. They only wanted 700 caps for it!
---
In my 300 hours of playing I've never had an explosive weapon drop, nor had I seen a decent legendary handmade (my main weapon) so I was rather excited. 
---
It replaced my regular handmade and boy did it open up a world of possibilities. Made the trip from 25 -50 an absolute breeze!
---
Depending on where her stats currently are, she could transition to a Bloodied Power Armor build if it's a closer goal than going to a Rifleman build.  Would mean switching to Heavy Guns though.  Emergency Protocols for the torso is a flat 50% damage reduction when below 20% health, so it synergizes well with Bloodied.
---

Something didn't load in properly. I've had this happen a few times on PC. Two solutions,  server hop or fast travel away to a new location and walk back.

Jokes on you! I’m in to that!
---
And flush to toilet
---
What buffs do you use?
---
It just works
---
Totally agree. The only thing that helps randoms right now is reviving them and having those specific perks. I dont know anyone who runs those.

Let me guess, but only those dumb enough not to rename the processes?

---
I'm a bounty hunter tell me his name I'll do this for free cause toxic players like that shouldn't pk
---
😂😂😂
---
while at vendors - don't forget to jump in your shielded casual underarmor for extra +3 CHR
---
It’s addicting!! My advice is take your time in the beginning. I miss being a new player; taking it all in.
---
Yes.
---
" Meat Week will now take place from **Thursday, August 20 - 26.** Primal Cuts events will start appearing at 11:00 a.m. ET that day so that you can collect some Prime Meat before the first Meat-Cook event at noon. "
---
Use radshield, it gives more rad resist and they stack, and doesn’t suppress mutations either
---
Sweet didn’t know if they’d delayed this as well
---
Yeah I’ve just been cruising along not to worried about level and what not. I’m just having a blast exploring right now
---
I have 4 vendors. 1 is in the lobby, you can't miss it, the others are off (the light is stupid and immersion breaking). Then you have to explore my huge 3 story warehouse and think a tiny bit.
---
A seedy shack out the back with the windows boarded up. You can jump and look through the little flap window on the side to see inside.
---
I use the security door in the attic, you can see the corner of the vendor. I even have guns hanging on the walls to clue people in.
---
The last one is not obvious, but it is a level 0 lock. The door that hides the biggest hoard.
---
If you check your camp build menu there's a Brahmin Grill skin (not the blue one from atomic shop) for the cooking station and also a Brahmin Stein on floor decor tab, both with lock icon (aka ingame plans) so I'm pretty sure they're going to be part of the new rewards.
---
Huh? How does that help when im getting ganked by enemy team?
---
Pipe is life......
---
You work for BGS, don't you?
---
But ofc.. Makes sense.
---
September 14 will be the last day to rank up, for Season 1 aka Legendary Run unless of course, they extend it. The Season 2 rewards and board have already been posted. Search PTS Season 2 Rewards and you will find it.
---
Oh, thats a good bet. Havent been able to play
---
So is it any meat from anywhere on the map or is it in the event area?
---
Totally intended feature. 0% chance they'd ever leave such a blatant issue if they never intended for it to be used as such. Just like the trial mine! If they didnt want to include such a nice reload buff, they would have bug tested and made sure it didn't.
---
Monster mash is a good source of legendaries.
---
Ah sorry, I misread your comment, thought you just wanted to play solo
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/358248/meat-week-faq-guide-feedback-thread?language%5B%5D=en

You have to wait for them to come back around unfortunately.
---
Cripes, I had a RABBIT open a door in my camp.   I put in the fireplace door; it was shut.  In hops a rabbit and the door opened so it could go through.   As a result, I had to lock the door because there's no point in having the fireplace if it's open and you can't even see the face of the thing.
---
The idea is to surpress mutations. Some mutations increase resistance to chems so they're not as effective. Grape Mentats effectiveness can be halved. So instead of a boost of 5 charisma you'll get 2.5 or less. Rad-X suppresses the mutation so you get the full effect of the chem. Diluted Rad-X removes the suppression. This isn't about rad resistance it's ah out suppressing your mutation so you can get the best price possible. Also effective if you have a charisma speech check with an NPC you want to pass.
---
People are Just getint bored because the lack of content
---
I just want the Fallout 4 vault tec DLC interactable items; some of them are in vaunt 51 already. Like the elliptical bike and the slot machine

---
Better start whipping up some Chally's feed.
---
I've had this issue, it's rather annoying 🙃
---
Thanks for the advice, sorry for my rant.
---
Yeah, I was on a break when the season came out and didn't start until nearly a month in. I'm ahead of him now.
---
I gave up when a wandering trader killed my pet in its first 30 seconds in my camp.
---
I had such trouble understanding if you need both the armor &amp; the gun effect OR even which specific effects you need. Some say 33% and bash damage, some say limb protection armor some say ldwb armor... it feels deliberate.
---

If I had the power to launch nukes in a wasteland I'd jump at any reason to be dropping them. When in Rome as they say.
---
Yeah it’s been leaked, there’s a couple new plans like the grill, dirty chally outfit, and the tenderizer plans
---
Join the world anyway, play for awhile, visit vendors, shoot enemies whatever, then log out to the main menu then log back in to the game. Your CAMP should be right where you left it.
---
I personally used Malwarebytes and haven't found any suspicious activity for FO76 but oddly enough Fall Guys had something detected by Malwarebytes.
---
Link?
---
Don't build in popular places, best advice we can give
---
The game has to load your assets after you connect, so can't check before you get dropped in, if it held you while it hopped you would complain about very long load in times, so you get the option instead
---
Don't forget to pause and breathe..
---
Ah ok, I thought you were talking mainly about after using rad x
---
I haven't had that particular issue, but I did have an issue where the option you needed was on a second screen and it didn't tell you that there was a second screen to go to.
---
Move your camp? Maybe?
---
Erm. The economy is destabilised and has been for months lol.
---
Worst advice ever.
---
Exactly. if one has top reload 27 times is a roll then the game is trying to tell you something..
---
Yes please!
---
Or .. counterpoint - make the warhead sound just before touchdown "Ameeeericaaaaa".... then the explosion and aftershock "Fuck yeaaahh..."
---
Not if you want to load in without getting this, I rarely get it.
---
What? Punctuation my man. If you're asking if you should go bloodied in pvp the answer is no. Go junkies, hit the damage cap but stay at full hp
---
The life is pipe..
---
In other words, don't build in Whitespring or near the Wayward unless you want to play the server hop load in game.
---
Check this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hpgxpu/new_meat_week_rewards/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and click the YouTube link OP commented, you can see the stuff that’s coming
---
Can I get an example
---
Of a wep with the effects? Thanks
---
I tried yesterday.  Was running out of time and the kid just wouldn't get it.   I gave up and logged off.
---
Oh yeah, thanks, I already have a JE laser and I don't really get how I'm more tanky at bloodied. I fought someone when I was maximising dr and er but minimising my damage output and I was hitting 3s on him and I met him again and hit quite high, what gear/build should I follow, ass/sent? van/sent?
---
Junkie's, Instigating, 33% more vats hit chance, 50% more limb damage, 40% more bash damage
---
I’m Level 51, I don’t know if I’m gonna make it. Oof.
---
You know way too much
---
The most important effect of luck is the chance of getting the Perfectly Preserved Pie ... Or atleast the number of tries it takes the claw to really deliver.

Someone probabaly had a magic heavy gun and just melted him.
---
5 minutes? I guess I'll fast to a train station and sell some stimpacks. I wouldn't have any time left after that thanks to the loading times.
---
I dont build either of those places. I still have connection issues every single load.
---
&gt; I don’t know what it was like when it first was released but it’s great now! 
---
It's not that great... It's mediocre at best. After your "honeymoon" is over you will see it yourself.
---
Don't rush with leveling, explore the world and "lore" while it's still enjoyable for you...
---
Yeah, it really is.   I have an anti-armor one that is wonderful for taking out vertibots and level 68 SM's.   A Hunter Prime is amazing with the Queen.
---
maybe but doesnt explain how i wasnt able to loot him or get the xp from the kill seeing i did plenty of damage to be able to
---
That's na Atomic Shop item.
---
Yes! Part of the reason I stopped play NW to begin with was the fact that I just got tired of Flatwoods and even the addition of Morgantown really wasn't enough to draw me back in (aside from Daily Challenges). The maps get old so quickly.
---
Why not both? It'd be awesome actually 😃
---
Yes, if you want a fair amount from the Atomshop you should be buying Atoms also, but it's a racket.
---
I asked my wife for a year's 1st for my birthday. I simply didn't need more clothes or a night out at a fancy restaurant...so like many others 1st folk contribute plenty to the game and I see lots of tents these days.
---
Paying £40 or $50 for enough Atoms to by three bundles and a clothing skin is horseshit. That should be 10 bundles and five skins...no argument. The Atomshop needs bulked up even if it  is just more re-skinned Fallout 4 things we all wanted in the game.
---
The Atomshop is way too highly priced for what you get and the Daily Atom should be back on the menu to bridge the costs !!!
---
damage rework doesn't fix shit.
---
I am not going to spoon feed you all the popular places, those were examples. If you get it and dont like it, you need to move, they arebt going to change it, so you need to change. Stubbornness will not resolve anything here.
---
I've got a two shot and yes, loads of fun.
---

---
It's almost as if you say something and I immediately respond to it and several comments later you develop amnesia as if I already didn't respond to it.
---
I know you said they need to remove limitations.  I illustrated why they don't need to do that.  You're suffering from comprehension problems.
---
Saying they're lazy is an opinion.  This isn't up for debate.  Not producing a game that you personally enjoy or the community enjoys has nothing to do with whether or not someone is lazy.
---
Take you, for example.  You've exerted a lot of energy in this thread to try and have some semblance of a rational opinion and failed miserably.  That doesn't mean you were lazy in your efforts just that you're completely clueless.
---
My last comment was to highlight an instance of you simply not understanding something so basic as the definition of what an opinion is, I.E. understanding the world.
---
It's no different than you saying they should remove limitations because 'it would force them to add content.'
---
This is like taking someone's parachute from them and pushing them out of the plane and saying 'It'll force them to come up with another solution.'
---
You can't strip away the revenue streams of the game and say it's somehow going to greatly benefit the game.
---
You take away the limitations.  You take away the last brass rings for people to come back every day.  You take away the community.  You take away the money.  You take away production.  You take away the future of the game.
---
Also, FO1st is fine the way it is. 
---
If you spend $10 on Atoms, you get 1,000 Atoms.
---
If you spend $13 on FO1st, you get 1,650 Atoms.
---
It's already worth it based purely on Atoms.
---
If they're feeling generous and want to implement more benefits, that's fine.  But they shouldn't do it because they feel pressured by a lot of entitled assholes on the internet who can't do simple math.

Truthfully i would love to have the cut Brotherhood version of attacking Fissure Site Prime. I personally don't like launching nukes, because statistically speaking: Appalachia would be turned into a crater.
---
But than again the canonical way of things: Fissure Site Prime was only nuked once. Well i guess now 2 nukes since nuking that Mine is the only option.
---
Wish we could use Dynamite or C-4 though.

If you noticed a pattern, like get two handguns in a row and you don't want handguns, stop for that day.   Switching servers might work.   But otherwise, you'll continue to draw more handguns than you'd expect.   I know it's supposed to be completely random RNG, but I've seen this pattern way too many times.

That 200 afk atom might get people to go to the atom shop, see something they like and buy atoms to get said item. And that is what beth wants. Since the atom challenges were removed I only go to the atom shop for the weekly free item. In the past I would brose the atom store often, because I had atoms to spend.

Some mutated spiders would be good too! xD Thanks!

Thanks.
---
I wonder if it's someone trying to do an exploit to steal stuff and the game just throws everything into stash as a way to prevent it.
---
You act as if it’s impossible to lvl, which I could understand if you were over lvl 1000 but as you’re only 200 it shouldn’t be that hard
---
I'd say both are good still ...

SBQ is one random 2\* reward, one random drop (up to) 3\* ... plus ultracite plans, more flux, repair kits ...

Big Guy is one (up to) 3\* random drop, one 3\* reward and one of the cursed or cosmetic/camp plans ... less flux, but loads of screws if you have the time to loot wendigos :D Plus the fight with Earle is a lot more fun right now...
---
All your INVENTORY went into stash?   Oh man.   That would take way too long to sort out.  :(
---
Pipe is life
---
Events in workshops aren't public btw, they are just events without the exclamation mark.
---
Wow, this really sucks. I dont get it, these basic camp design items should be up all year.
---
That's what I did too. Although, the weird thing was: I already got to level 2 inside the vault by picking up all the stuff and checking the overseer's terminal. But that level up somehow didn't count. Maybe it's because you're still inside the vault en not yet in the actual world?
---
I didn’t try claiming any workshops in my last play-through of an hour and had no server issues.
---
I don’t know how to do it with my router but I think the PS4 can do it based on some settings
---
Their mothers clearly didn’t raise them right
---
Magic heavy guns tend to outdamage everyone and everyone then gets nothing.
---
Inshort cheating bastards screwed you over
---
While I agree, causing artificial urgency seems the way most companies are doing things these days. I dont think it'll change
---
doesn't happen to me but to some of my friends. They say burst fire can fix it.
---
you can get canned beef stew from Feed The People. back in the early years FTP used to give it to everyone on the sever but apparently it was a glitch? now you've got to do the event to get it.
---
I wish we are on the same platform that would have be cool to experience
---
Thanks! You could solo it pretty easily if you stay in the right place. The Wendigo spawns are a pain in the ass but it's doable for sure. I accidentally killed him too fast yesterday with a 'magic effect' Minigun before any mobs spawned. Luckily the other guy that was with me in the instance got some shots in before it was over! I never wanted to be 'that guy' who kills everything in a few seconds. I think they made him less bullet spongy because the couple times I fought him with others in the PTS it was harder.
---
There's a solo video from SH Games: [https://youtu.be/o70gElbUnxg](https://youtu.be/o70gElbUnxg)
---
You can also use your new character to level up in NW. Just hide in some bush, probably have to survive the first storm and I think you're done.
---
kinda guessed that, cant wait for one wasteland hope it makes it better for me as im only level 95
---
Haha. Well, yeah  that’s true for me too.
---
Also, as the devs of the tool said on that forum, the only people who got recently banned were the team who tested the internal build of the tool that hasn't been released yet. 
---
Seemingly no bans had been issued to people using previous version of that tool (the one that worked prior the latest hotfix), so I guess that's just devs who got caught while testing some stuff with their new build that got them flagged.
---
Also, I know people who used this tool extensively for a long time. No bans whatsoever.
---
Leather coat is a super rare drop from events, think its only mire events but am not sure.
---
The Gauss pistol plan is able to be purchased from regs after completing wasetlanders
---
Please tell.me.your on ps4
---
It's very enjoyable up til around level 30 when you've got most of the map discovered. 
---
Up to that point, every time you set out to do something you are actively exploring the wasteland, getting distracted and looting randomly on your way to the destination. Stopping at a train station out of convenience because you are passing it, not because you are overloaded and heading there specifically. In other words, you are playing the game.
---
Past level 30, we have enough of the map discovered that we can easily just fast travel everywhere. Even if you haven't discovered the exact location you need to go to, chances are you have a location 'within walking distance'. 
---
So the end result is, staring at load screen after load screen. Holding your controller for 30 seconds and then another load screen into the building. 3 minutes of clearing and grabbing your objective and then it's more load screens followed by load screens. 
---
The more you discover, the less you actually 'play'. 
---
We spend a vast amount of time just staring at load screens and waiting. Instead of running around actively playing. 
---
But we're doing this to ourselves. We're choosing convenience over fun, choosing to expedite the gameplay so we can get the reward quicker, and then wondering why we're lamenting the loss of gameplay. 
---
I stopped when I had this realization. Well I stopped when I got overly frustrated after I realized I'd stared at load screens for a total of 35 minutes out of the hour I had to play. Sure I gathered more supplies as a result, but the fun I had doing so was greatly diminished. 
---
Now I'm back to playing like I did at level 15. If I have a mission all the way down in Watoga, and my camp is in Toxic Valley... Well that's going to take me a bit to get to. 
---
I still allow use of 76, my camp and my survival tent (in a permanent location) as a triangle of travel but I'm *only* allowed to fast travel to those 3 locations (unless I'm teamed and running events) and everywhere else... I walk to. 
---
It's returned the fun for me, made it a game again and not a chore. I'm back to being shocked by random encounters, enjoying the scenery and having fun getting sidetracked exploring once more. 
---
I'm level 75.
---
Yeah, thats right.
---
But if didnt play at that period of time (like me) you have to wait for god knows how long. Prettty unfair. I just wanna spend my damn atoms, bethesda, so let me lol
---
How would it get any better? If anything it'll make it worse for you. Since everything will be maxed out for you, while lower levels are able to dish out more damage
---
Not sure if it'll be applying to boss fights, havnt been keeping up with the pts
---
Yeah, did it couple times while cooking.
---
Not really, I was one of those who found out that beth used/uses white and blacklists instead of checking address spaces for write-access.
---
And before you go further, yes, I/we told beth that this is not the way to check for cheats.
---
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!
---
*SWAT!*
---
Uhhhhhng harder, daddy.
---
from what i understand one wastelands gonna balance everyone to do the same damage which would improve it for lower like me
---
It can.  Kinda.   You can also try putting your PS4 in your network’s DMZ.
---
I know the ammo converter is a pita, but with that many rounds, you could use one of the 10x levels, and it would go pretty fast.   Just a thought?
---
If you are on a resource node, you are in a 'popular' spot regardless.
---
Nothing changes for you after 50...
---
Geez, guess I won't be scrapping for Slugger perk cards for the legendary perk cards.   Wow!
---
Which ones?
---
Damm it I missed it I wanted that one got the others hopefully it will come back at Halloween this year. Yeah should have a replace option.
---
No, that's not what it does, it reduces the degree to which buffs stack, but they still stack, a crap build is still a crap build and doesn't gain anything.
---
well if one wasteland is gonna do what its meant to do then everyones gonna be balanced and doing the same damage
---
I've been doing nothing but taking workshops and defending this week, specifically trying to get the large toolbox plan...
---
The sheer overwhelming amount of duplicate plans I've dropped is staggering. I've taken 4 or 5 workshops a day this week, and defending them all multiple times and I've ended up with the exact same park grill plan a total of 16 times!
---
Still no sign of the 1 plan I actually wanted. 
---
I'm starting to hate Sunshine Meadows, but I've got enough sugar bombs to hit score challenges for weeks. ;p
---
7 levels left for me!
---
Was this today on PC? Cause someone in my Earl fight did this or the event went squirly. There was a lot of confused emotes. Then later tonight players all chucked everything we had at him and failed. Most damage was as high as 14 and wendigo spawns up the wazoo. I ended up losing 30 stims and got bounced to 1min respawn. Which is penalising those who go balls to the wall / melee
---
Not how it works...
---
My moneys goes for the last option.
---
Yeah, I was not happy when I discovered it did nothing.
---
Wish I could bring myself to throw them on the ground.  Currently have 450 in my stash lol.
---
Yeah, I’ll try which build is perfect for me when it launches on console. Thanks anyway
---
That's it. That is fuking terrifying. Well done
---
At level 95 you are not considered a low level. You are considered a high level and will be facing enemy's at their max level
---
That's not a feature of One Wasteland.
---
Damage is going to be recalculated: Multipliers are added up instead of multiplied by each other, so there won't be any people doing astronomical damage.
---
But you'll still be able to achieve very high damage through use of things like Bloodied or Junkie's.
---
And "Magic" weapons are glitched due to interactions with Legendary effects and Fire Rate, not damage, so they'll still be able to melt even the biggest boss in seconds.
---
So much weight haha
---
'Close the darn door. We don't live in a barn'.
---
The Vault door opened and closed itself and all interior vault doors are pneumatic, not our fault we weren't prepared for this crazy apocalypse filled with hinged entryways!
---
personally, i wanna know why Davenport still trusts us to do it in the first place
---
I know how you feel. There's still stuff I'm waiting on. Luckily stuff seems to cycle pretty regularly
---
Source for sept 14?
---
Melee weapon.   I have two characters.   On the first one, I tried to stick with guns.   Always an ammo battle.   On the second one, my partner made a bat with heated coils on it, and that thing carried me far.  It was so much easier.   Eventually, the good guns roll in, along with perks like Ammosmith and SuperDuper, which help dramatically with ammo supply....and then I went to guns.

---
Can't you use the Red Mothman Headlamp from the Atom Shop if it ever becomes available?
---
Or am I remembering wrong?
---
Funny enough, it seems the cheaters are some of the most "dedicated" fans. They own multiple accounts, often have fallout 1st on more than one of those accounts, and grind through the main quest, tadpole badges, etc every time one of their characters gets banned or wiped. Makes you question why they cheat instead of actually playing the game
---
Generally, you're not supposed to just google "gamename cheats" and pick the first result because that gets you instantly banned and/or gives you multiple viruses. But for fallout 76, doing that actually worked without any repercussions
---
The horde events also spawn a legendary 👍
---
That pumpkin pie though - insta-death when I ate it. Never again.
---
Not to mention that each vault dweller happens to have a personal semi-sentient giga drill that can surface seemingly anywhere in the wasteland
---
No I got it on xbox with a friend of mine still dont have a fix besides their suggestions above.
---
Pretty sure we're getting meat week today, but I'm pretty sure we're not going to get a colossal problem for a while, it's still broken on PC
---
excuse me for the noob question but,how can I get one?I can craft some vault suit,but they seem to have no special bonuses
---
I mean, if you use the red barn building set technically you do live in a barn
---
Well fingers crossed the update is the only thing pushed back. Feeling abit starved for content at the moment so I'm looking forward to Grahm paying us a visit
---
I've just removed all my doors
---
You need find and learn the plan for the linings. You can look for any plan in the game using this link  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=677033239](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=677033239)
---
I've been playing for a year and some change now, i have a blast every day i play. The world and lore are still rich and i still love levelling up
---
80 gold for Earle, 2x 3 star drops , 2 to 4 flux, unique outfit 
---
40 gold for SBQ , 1 to 5 mostly 1 star drops, 4 to 8 flux, ultracite and prime reciever plans 
---
Earle costs twice as much ammo maybe 3 times , for the easy gold and scrip and screws my ammos on him
---
I love this idea.
---
Trade in some of the bakclog of treasury notes and items for scrip. 
---
Pretty much all I do most of the time anyway.
---
Pretty much all explosive damage gets reduced to 1. The difference with an explosive cryo is it fires like projectiles so you can hit from a distance and still get the freezing effect.
---
Icons do get rotated out. 
---
Also some are NW rewards or 1st membership perks.
---
Just got one plan from the "A Colossal Problem" event.
---
It's not cheating it's a bug Bethesda has known about and refused to fix for 6 months
---
*Looks at Bloodied Gauss minigun .. 
---
So a legit weapon makes me a cheater ok
---
Really thought this would’ve been addressed by now, as the player being actively penalised for buying a jet pack ‘skin’ surely dissuades them from making any more purchases like that in the future.
---
Install "betterinventory" it wont let you drop favorited items.
---
supermutants are the best for xp try to use buffs of xp
---
The novelty will quickly wear off and a week from now everyone will be back to mindlessly nuking the queen.
---
For alcohol there are a bunch of bottles in the wayward.
---
For workshop I recommend the farm by the river on the east side of the map. There are only a few enemies in the house by the workshop bench usually.
---
For screws or springs go to sugar grove. The office you start in has desk fans and clipboards everywhere
---
For bots and events hit vault-Rec agriculture, nobody ever runs the event that spawns there. Farmhands are easy killing
---
Leveling up is probably the one that can cause problems. Especially if you are a higher level. If you really don’t care you can make a new character and level them up and delete them
---
Hack a terminal: vault tec agriculture again. Level zero terminal on the upper floor
---
Its easy if you are bloodied, well rested, cranberry relish, lunchbox, inspirational etc
---
Translation- to make life easier/be achievable in your busy life, play this particular way, with these special stats and farming routes despite having a massive emphasis of “be the character you want to be”  
---
Good luck low int gun slinger
---
I love 76 but they really do need to sort out weapons ability, i want to play with a revolver and feel like i’m actually contributing in a fight. At this point a pistol is just something you can use in low level areas unless you stack mutations and bloodied/sneak in which case refer to translation above.
---
im almost lv300 this new event is helping me to lvl up lol praise these wendigos
---
Nuke silo holotape takes your personal cooldowns
---
Maybe OP needs to sell stuff from their vendors. I do that all the time too, I won't settle for a world without my camp when I need caps.
---
it just works!
---
33 vats hit, bashing,  and  Iimb damage are all bugged effects that start gettjng funky around 200 fire rate.
---
I have one in my vendor right now for 1500 caps [PC]
---
It's eery how often I load into a server and I'm asked if I would like to find another one cos my camp is nuked when I'm right under the Whitespring next to the bunker
---
Another legacy bug from Fallout 4. FO76 caused them to finally fix the lever action rifle reload bug from FO4, but I think if this one hasn’t been addressed by now then it never will be.
---
https://youtu.be/MzlK0OGpIRs
---
Same thing can happen with big Al's tattoo parlor and the burrows as well.  Wild Appalachia locations just randomly do this for some reason.
---
This would be awesome, I'd also love some nukashine xxx strength that makes you forget who you are and let's you redo your special stats
---
But it can know not to try the same world 10 times in a row. This is the OP's point.
---
Err mah gerd......WHY DID I NOT THINK ABOUT DOING THIS!
---
weekly atoms should be back but
---
if you rushed the season before it ended and you have nothing to do is your fault, wait till they it finished
---
That's highly unlikely and/or he is exaggerating to make a point.
---
Just click GO GO GO.
---
Then once you level.  Delete the character.
---
In promotional shots, it showed a power conduit built into one of the protrusions, but that was absent in the final version. Except, apparently if you destroy the bunker with the flame-thrower trap, you can see the conduit in the ‘repair’ image.
---
It could be an 'In joke': Pipe, in French, is slang for a blowjob...
---
Level2 seems to not count. I have skipped the perk cards and emerged, which puts you at lvl2 as you enter Appalachia, but still no SCORE. Level3 seems to be the first one to trigger it. Or maybe the level up triggered during the loading screen. Either way, I found that you have to hit the Wayward for the quickest leveling
---
Same as the hotdog daily at Camden. You can avoid the movement penality by turning your back to the next hotdog you want to eat.
---
Maybe the screenshot makes it darker. And it was at the bottom of a mine.
---
Care to share that gt? I'd love to see this setup! I'm currently trying to rp a raider as well. Gt: That B Word
---
I picked my spot by the wayward and intend to keep it because I like it. The game still doesn't let you blueprint large structures so I don't really want to rebuild from scratch somewhere else.
---
Also, my point wasn't that I couldn't load my camp in a popular spot, I know it's popular, my point was that the game puts me in the EXACT same session instead of a different one. If it was a new world each time and a different camp was in my spot I would understand, however the function doesn't work if it keeps putting me in the same server every time.
---
I'm pc :(
---
Rewards are good at all, but which flight is more fun?
---
Also be careful, you can use wallpapers that you haven't bought. But when it's gone, you can't use them again.
---
I was disappointed yesterday as I wanted to expend my CAMP, but realized that I don't own the dark wood wallpaper that I used on the main structure some weeks ago...
---
You Don't kill much queen or colosus realy? Lol
---
Queen are 4 fluxs
---
Willian 2 fluxs
---
Best ealry on, it does get repetitive and even tedious but all in all its a good game. Its addictive to but you don't need money, so in turn if you have no money you're not going to have to give the local dealer head to play, it's a free high.
---
no. reward us for our main characters.  it easy to respec/rebuild after level 100.
---
different characters must grind their stuff out.
---
How did you know what my alts cards are??
---
I don't believe it was the same server that many times, the game tells played to put their camp down early on, that's where loads put it, also people trying to sell to newbies, you are always going to have issues there.
---
Agree with everything except the final line -   
---
When free atoms were a thing, people weren't paying at all.   
---
It wasn't bridging the gap, it was just getting paid cosmetics for free.   
---
Which was frankly quite silly.
---
Lol I hope to run into some more RPers someone was running a hotel yesterday, which was amazing since I was so far away from my camp and out of food and water. Really enjoying player interaction! 
---
Oh and side note Mr Fuzzy? Isn’t that the responders programmer personal robot? Think read that on a terminal today
---
You’ve just made me realize my collection is unlocked and explains why there’s nothing in it when I check. Smh
---
I wasn't loading in near my camp but where I was spawning I could see someone else's camp. It was there every time.
---
exaggerate much.
---
pfft..
---
i have a theory that they don't work bc the robots would go there to look like if they are mining something lol
---
but yeah I spam the buttons to get that precious lead and some works other don't
---
That’s it. As soon as I log in later, I’m fast traveling to every single players camp. Pick your locks, take your junk, ammo, and water. Open every single door, then bugger off. Rinse and repeat on all five characters....
---
Welcome back, my advice is to head back to the vault and start by talking to the two people up there. That will get you started. 
---
When you find yourself near a train station, read the 3 posters on the wall. 
---
Besides that, spend time exploring. A lot of new locations have been added or altered.
---
For glowing enemies and/or cryptids: Toxic Larry's guarantees 3 glowing Snallygasters
---
We had someone with a magic gun last night, but in fairness they let everyone get their licks in first: down 1/4, magic attack, mutate, down 1/4  then magic finish.
---
Put up a camp next to the cemetery in the Toxic Valley and sell shovels :)
---
True.
---
Then you're the worlds most unlucky person, you see my point about Wayward though...
---
i didn't know the exit and i found myself trapped vs 15 wendigos in some corner of the cave lol I just accepted death and fought all of them till the mine collapsed it was pretty cool tho xd
---
Same reason someone would play FO4 with tgm on, I guess.
---
Silva homestead. Tons of corn and razor grain.
---
If I remember correctly they have actually fixed them in the PTS so magic weapons will be gone next patch.
---
if you are not tanky or bloodied you need to play with the structure of the center and avoid being spit like a non believer. Just bc of the wendigos and look the ground
---
Or combine it with the challenge where you buy 3 times from another player. Pick crops and neighboring flowers. 
---
Just make sure you spend some money. I’m sure that way no one minds.
---
Don't forget the party boy/girl perk to boost that beer. If you have 6+ CHR of course
---
Hm...
---
I suppose it would be better than no mod for the occasional bash. Thanks for the testing!
---
Good luck! I'm finishing up to this week.
---
Sounds like most my nights with an 18 pk and a half ounce of weed lol
---
i got a junkies one and i wanted to play with it just for fun
---
then i reach the workbench and the weapon says 4/30something mods learned and i was LMAO where do i get these? xd
---
And don't forget sleep buff as well
---
Wasteland Rule #1: What happens in the vault, stays in the vault. 
---
No, just kidding - you were able to leave the vault at level 1 quite a while ago by joining someone on the friend list, but not anymore. Today, you always end up with a level 2 char when you step outside.
---
can I pay you in wood,cloth and other mixed junk?
---
Just look for the flashing yellow lights. Those mark the way out
---
The life of Pipe
---
&gt; If you die before Earle, you spawn inside the mine up the shaft. If you die after Earle, you spawn outside the exit.
---
this is a problem bc the game don't consider that you are dead until the timer reach 0... so If you have a respawn timer of 60seconds even if you are just a pile of meat in the ground dead af the games still think you are alive and in 60 sec a lot can happen and he can die if he was low health xd
---
Lets say that he stole 300 rounds,thats 300 caps if i sold them on a vendor, id have to use 20 level 3 locks to for him to have an equal bounty,and then id have to repair those locks.
---
They are lazy
---
Not enough to realize it was a flat number , I thought i was getting 8 from queen sometimes lag possibly on pop up
---
Which dialect?
---
You mean that drill that was able to tunnel into one of the most reinforced structures in the entire world?  Nah, no way that thing can bust open an old mineshaft, that's crazy talk.
---
[you probably would like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBy_VILqVC0)
---
it's like the institute meets the weird shit happening in the vault + mother russia lol
---
I turn all the lights off before I leave then close the doors.
---
I tought I found all of them,I'll have to check
---
Played it a few times now, and I've legit never found the exit. I just wait for the timer to expire, you don't fail or anything so it really doesn't matter.
---
prob someone else on their quest in there.
---
He liked it when you watched him buy stuff.
---
Is Nuka Wild actually in game?
---
Aside from the Nuka Bar having it advertised, I've never seen it in game ever. 
---
Come to think of it, I've never seen Orange either. 
---
I have been encountering Cranberry quite often lately.
---
The best is 15% block on an armor piece makes all your guns magic (shotguns, explosive or two shot weapons near 100 fire rate, all guns near 200 fire rate)
---
The most important tip I can give you, save your lv up points and spend them once you decide what build suits for you!
---
Camp by the wayward then expect to server hop a lot......
---
Sorry buddy, XB1. Unfortunately my xbox has been left in shambles after my failed ttempt to unsolder the broken Out HDMI port and replace it with the In HDMI port.... I haven't been online in ~2 months and wont be online until next gen. lol.
---
If you’re Xbox, what’s your GT?
---
I’ve saw some people say it’s coming out today later
---
Well, it heals you during your "trip". So.
---
Pipe is Life.
---
Oh I love mine too. And it's will keep you so busy.
---
welcome to the 'MUST HAVE MORE CRIMSON FLUX' club
---
New god mode glitch? I haven’t heard of that on console. How is it done?
---
This is the way.
---
What did he say?
---
Even when the Wendigo Colossus *was* out in the wild, it basically just hung out by itself, not bothering anyone, until people showed up to start shooting at it.
---
I'm nearly 100% positive that it tracks the server silos. I've been onto a server with no nukes launched, holotape shows 0m cooldown on all 3 silos and I get to the end only to be told I still have to wait an hour and a half to launch.
---
That's the reason i'm using automatic garage door, sometime is laggy but it works :D
---
My favorite way to appear is out of nowhere because of the stealth suit, and i wear a sheepsquach mascot head at all times... Stare in windows without moving etc..
---
Or i also like stalking low level players while cloaked and randomly shooting enemies theyre fighting or lobbing random grenades (im in pacifist so wont damage them)
---
He was probably just bored and was just trying to make things interesting.
---
Points in Endurance will directly affect the number ofserver disconnects you experience.
---
Higher endurance -= longer stable play sessions.
---
They had a ‘b.e.t.a.’ for the game itself that lasted at least a month and acted on little if any of the feedback from it - look at the memes from launch. Besides, why should players pay for a game and in some cases subscription on top of it only to have to ‘test’ it - we’re talking about a $60 product at launch with $100 annual subscription (for some) to a AAA studio, not some early access dev build from a startup. I for one won’t do unpaid work for a ‘AAA’ dev team on a game which, in its credits screen, already lists more people in QA and testing roles than any other aspect of its development.
---
Id make a new character to see all the changes from start to finish. Its good to have more than one character anyway. Just have two different builds.
---
&gt; Huge chunk beth dickriders out tonight.
---
Lol, imagine being like this. 
---
Move your camp. Or don’t and server hop “27” (bullshit) times. That’s just how the game works, Einstein.
---
I did but still to no avail and I was also in a private game with friends that where doing whatever.
---
It's what happens when you let Ms. Nanny's raise your kids tsk tsk
---
Ok this is all good to know thank you
---
Same. Which actually reminds me of some lyrics from Big D &amp; The Kids Table....something something instead of fiddling with all the locks I'll take the hinges off all of the doors.
---
The most I’ve ever had to hop was twice. And my camp is in a very popular spot with a lead deposit.
---
Imagine being me, thats so hard to do xd. Yall riding that bethesda dick so hard tonight ;) enjoy your life.
---
Meat week is due to start in like 5 hours, I've this feeling they might let that finish before releasing A Colossal problem on console, I really hope thats not the case. Some communication is sorely needed. The fact that so many people didn't even realise it wasn't releasing for console at the same time as PC just goes to show that Bethesda don't do enough to communicate with their playerbase.
---
I've been playing almost daily since beta and I'm not bored of it yet. Just depends on the person.
---
I can't play call of duty every day but I can play fallout 76 every day. Crazy what games keep my interest, fallouts I've always sunk crazy amount of hours in to them and they were single player..
---
I like 76. I'll be sad when it goes offline.
---
You might want to replicate the bounty going away without junk? Never happened to me and i like getting bounty to see who challenges me
---
At least you can report it
---
Roll a fresh character, run to the wayward, complete the hold-up event, that will get you most of the xp for a lvl, go over the road and craft a weapon and an armor. If you need a few more XP, go kill 2-3 things. There you have a level in a bout 10mins, then log out and delete the character.
---
I should probably have made it clear I was mostly being sarcastic. Developers who use their player base as QA testers is ridiculous, obviously.
---
I've tried to avoid fast travelling. But those mountains. Would be nice if they added a grapple or something. Maybe a system like in death stranding where people can leave climbable points for the next player.
---
Sorry I don't get that reference lol, my camp is underground so I don't need the doors anyway
---
I level up quick. Downloaded like the day it came out on game pass (I was on ps4 pro before) and I'm already level 112. Can't get enough of it. Something about the wasteland keeps me occupied.
---
Thank you for the time, I’ve been trying to find out the time it started and wasn’t having much luck. I should’ve guess it be about 6pm for me
---
They do, they're major dupers to. Even the man himself, Todd Howard invented godmode and then removed it. He also does RMT, he swears it's to help with development of the game though. Hes even got a Bloodied Explosive FFR Vats accuracy, less Vats Handmade that he calls Todd mode.
---
ah then i don't know. 
---
Had the issue with a quest in Burrows, and moving to other server it was all fine.
---
Hence my reasoning.
---
I wasted so many on stupid cards I didn't want or need, not realizing I could save them.  Don't ask me how I didn't realize it.   Stupidity, I guess.
---
Yeah as soon as I offloaded my junk the bounty vanished. I added one item of scrap back and nothing.... Then I added about 35 waste acid and then the 20 cap bounty came back.
---
Dumped it again in my stash and the bounty was gone... Picked some junk back up and there's the bounty again.
---
I checked the map each time too and the wanted icon appeared and vanished accordingly.
---
Guess you need to have something the player can loot (as well as the cap reward?)
---
Indeed!
---
My first camp was actually at the base of the ski lift to Top of the World just so other players could have a travel point to the one way up. 
---
My current camp is just a bit to the south west of Top and my tent is parked between Morgantown and the Valley. 
---
So if I have to cross the divide, I can FT to the other side via one of my 3 options. 
---
Marsupial/Jetpack helps with the rest. ;p
---
Flyswatter takes about 5 seconds to complete
---
Just to be annoying, when I drop plasma cores I fire a few pew pews through each one before I drop them.
---
So that when someone needs them and picks them up, they aren't stacked MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
So glad you're enjoying it!   BTW, it is not repetitive by the time you hit level 30.   Maybe by level 300.
---
Same.....
---
Dude beth dickriders out super hard tonight, they probably paid some social media management company for some upvotes/downvotes. I get your issue, but people being deliberately daft and trying to make it seem like this is a YOU problem, when clearly this problem is a lack of ability to program competently. They both a, dont check if its the same server you just loaded into &amp; b, don't check if you can place camp before load in which any competent survival mmo should do.
---
queen is always 4 fluxs
---
1. Spend some of those caps on gold.
---
2. Spend some of those caps on ammo from player vendors.
---
3. Spend some of those caps on ammo from NPC vendors.
---
You have 50k caps, you shouldn't be having an ammo problem...
---
October.... Oh... you didn't mean The Mandalorian? Oops.
---
How do you have 20k more caps than the 30k cap limit?
---
NO! your not allowed to have fun! the funny memes and "bethesda sucks" trains told me so! /s
---
but seriously glad to see more people giving it a try, sure it was a horrible start but its come al ong way same as ESO though it still has a way to go before being great rather than just good
---
I got a bit peeved with people opening my shutters from outside and then jumping inside, thus leaving Both the shutters And door open when they leave! My front door is unlocked so I don't know why they like to come in the back way?
---
Crit damage, how much ammo and aid you find in world boxes, weapon and armor durability, how often super duper procs when crafting ammo and other things...
---
I'll try again tomorrow to confirm this wasn't a one time thing.... Back when I was level 12 and that high level killed me, I knew someone would come for me, so ran around in just my underwear and had nothing else on me (was still wanted) I got two punches on them before I died, lol.
---
Mr Fuzzy is the mascot of the camden park amusement park. There are three repeatable daily quests there. Completing these quests gives Mr Fuzzy tokens and the regular event rewards (sometimes also a legendary). If you save up these tokens you can buy the Mr Fuzzy outfit and head (among others). You can get 9 tokens from those 3 events together and the outfit + head cost 450 tokens. So it is kind of a grind, making the outfits pretty rare.
---
XD on ps4 haven't seen this event yet.  Radiation rumble all we got.. And Westek
---
Without legendary effects my stealth rifleman/commando hybrid does “okay” enough for me to be happy with, even if it takes its time so yours should be fine as well
---
Its in the water ... Its beautifull !!!
---
I kind of hope they can be a bit of a Hammerspace of sorts and hear me out. I can see them likely being whenever you make an enclosed structure with a door or perhaps via a hatch to a "basement" formed from the foundation pieces. That being said, i'd like the ability to make them a bit of a hammerspace. My dream camp involves using the communist fences (unless we get a proper chainlink fence set with doorway piece), the unreleased Ranger Tower atomic shop prefab, and a Quonset Hut building set if it were to be added from Fallout 4 to make an ammo depot camp built into the mountain side. The tower would sit on the corner with the fence enclosing the area. The barracks structure would act like a tunnel entrance to an interior instance, where inside i'd make a tunnel system linking to a store/workshop, barracks, a messhall, a rec center, restrooms, and storage.
---
Aaaahhh okay coolio!
---
hope we are taking some bullets so you can get a more polished version later bro
---
I like instigating with my rifle build. Currently I have a nice instigating fixer and lever, and a two shot explosive and instigating explosive handmades on my previous character waiting for me to level up.
---
Eyyy but the watch has sentimental value that must count for something.
---
nah quite easy actually i can just hold left/right and turn around, PC user on controller here
---
So, Mighty Glacier vs Fragile Speedster vs Glass Cannon?
---
In PVP, there's already a Damage per hit cap (iirc), so maxing Damage is pointless. 
---
Having high HP/DR/ER is probably better than focusing on Damage, but even that caps out, and Stims aren't hard to stock up on.
---
Fire Rate seems to be the best option, Damage per hit is still capped, but Damage Per Second isn't.
---
TL;DR: Fire Rate first, then HP/DR. Damage is an overated stat in PVP.
---
It’s broken either way. The floor makes everything float. Start make your float jokes.
---
We had a reverse case at my buddy's camp. We realized the BoS banner stand could be used for "recreational purposes" so we set up seating around it. About seven poor vault dwellers stumbled upon my character wearing only a sackhood dancing on the banner with my buddies hysterically laughing. Four of them joined in.
---
Cork for the cork gooodddd !!!
---
we just need a new machine for energy ammo xd
---
I imagine turning off lights pisses people off even more.
---
Had no idea you could fast travel lol
---
np
---
good tip: you need to work your way up to a certain 'build', like what weapons (rifle, melee, heavy, shotgun, ...) you will use and what playstyle (stealth or not, vats or not, ... ).  
---
usually new players have no clue what they'll want as their final build (which is normal). This can lead to choosing perk cards when you level up that you will never use in your final build and hence are kind of a lost perk card. To minimize the amount of chosen 'wrong' perks, you can start planning your build here:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I got a lot of inert bombs that could do the trick instead. Hell, give me a suit of excavator armor, we slap a drill onto the hand, and we could Big Daddy the hell out of the rubble.
---
it is a really great, easy going video game.
---
enjoy yourself. don't rush. Spend your legendary scrip on 2 star weapons at the purveyor as you go. There is always more scrip.
---
don't worry about 'builds this and that'.. you will find your groove as you go. at later levels respeccing is not an issue.
---
There is a lot to do besides just chasing levels.
---
Ah okay I was hoping there would be a reset system because I’ve just been picking willie nilly lol....thanks for this!
---
My tip: never ever grind towards something! You'll lose your enyoment. Most people get frustrated because they don't get a god tier weapon, armor or cloths in X amount of tries.
---
I learned it the hard way
---
You failed to protect your C.A.M.P.  What can you personally do better in the future?
---
Unfortunately not exaggerated. I could see someone's camp in the same place every time the world loaded.
---
Unless several players had built the identical camps in the same spot.
---
Only *Crits* and item *Condition*. Doesn't affect anything else that you mentioned unfortunately.
---
A bit after SBQ last night some guy in PA asked me to dance by shooting me in the back.  Already had my JFFR LMG equipped so the answer was swift.  Anyway, he sought revenge and I stuck around to kill another SB.  Eventually saw him again as i was looting and ignored it but once he realized it was me (megaton hair doesn't help) he gat plasma'd me down before before I could react.  2more kills for me, one for him and I ft'd away. At one point he gestured to come to him, noob with a duped plasma thinks he's god, lol.
---
This is such a dumb argument, Bethesda can add an inactivity timer and boom. Nobody will sit in a chair for 8 hours a day over playing a game.
---
the second season (Armor Ace) will come out when the current season ends.
---
the Steel Dawn questline that will introduce the new Brotherhood of Steel isnt coming out until it's done, whenever that is, but they are shooting for a fall release so they have till november unless they delay it.
---
and the Fractured Steel update, which is going to be a Wastelanders-sized update in terms of content, is coming sometime in winter, so December-March, roughly.
---
They're making fast travel to Crater and Foundation free in the upcoming update. If anything use those for fast travel, then teleport over to 76 and then to the Overseer's house at a reduced cost.
---
that would defeat the purpose of all other backpack mods.
---
Something like this happen to me and my group then at end guy drops tons of level 3 weapons. 
---
Me and my friends aren't nubs and are over 100 so it was truly Random and enjoyable.
---
 He did kill us both  about 5 times first. 
---
Wild will west day I guess.
---
Luck affects *Crits* and the *Condition* of items you find. ;)
---
The pond we are talking about isn't a marked one. Its just a cute little unmarked pond. If you type in "fo76 camp locations" to youtube the second video that shows up by a guy called watsonkhd, watch that video, the first location he shows is the pond and he shows exactly on the map where it is.
---
Is the pipe life????
---
It's lazy writing.
---
Event needs a nuke zone, so nuke is required, so an excuse to nuke the place is required.
---
Personally I would have written a story to the affect of a suspected secondary Scorchbeast nest deep down in the mine, and rather than lose people to investigate it should just be nuked to be sure. But then the intel turns out to be wrong and you just nuked a Wendigo Colossus into existence.
---
Seems like a much more thematically appropriate story than using a nuke the clear some debris... like what the fuck.
---
Whenever I see new players I drop them about 15 or so stimpacks each. I get some many from the blood eagles, cultists, and chinese communists.
---
apparently crops you planted in your camp count as "wild". took one pass through my farm and i was halfway done
---
90% weight reduction is great for treasure maps but this is a good tip
---
It’s a bug since Patch 21.
---
There is no scheduled maintenance for today on consoles so I highly doubt it’s coming today.
---
\+15 of agility... wait that's not even a bad idea
---
My record was 4. BE laser rifle pre dupe, 4% health and ass/sent heavy combat armor.
---
Yeah, not gonna happen.
---
at level 225 your character can basically be any build. 
---
Stealth commando would be better
---
90% of the items are broken anyways, no way Bethesda would let you see that
---
Bethesda doesn’t do enough of a lot of things
---
Outside of a hotfix, they just take down individual servers to reset them.
---
I use the stealth suit and a fixer I modified along with the rifle perk cards and I do ok.     For the queen I use my power armor and a heavy weapon though.  
---
I’d like to get a legendary fixer but don’t have one yet.  
---
I like sneaking up on enemies and taking them out as fast as possible.   
---
The only problem is that you have to be careful not to get swarmed in places with lots of high level enemies like Whitesprings.
---
I just pretend it's a camera.
---
I plan on leveling a new character this weekend. Can I do that with Meat Week and still contribute?
---
Exactly
---
sometimes when I'm bored I'll go around and unlock as much stuff as I can find to get my bounty as high as I can before someone kills me. 90 is as high as i've gotten, it gets a lot harder to find the camps once you're wanted
---
Small correction (if i haven't missed something). They have not said the exact date for the season 2 start. All they have said is that it will start on september.
---
I’ll believe it when I see it.
---
I suspect we won’t see it until next Tuesday.
---
Sigh, should have guessed...  I'll await the fix...  thanks.
---
Leader bobbleheads
---
I don’t want to *lose* the option of playing that character if that makes any sense.
---
why not a little fatman on top?   
---
seriously, thats way too overpowered....
---
Yea I agree with you I’m not believing it but still want to have hope
---
Me too...we need at least something.
---
 My Opinion, People said in the colossus you spend more ammunition, false, colosus is easy to kill, but in the queen there may be 8,10,12,14 players, instead in the colossus there may be 5,6,8, for casual players it is more probably  to be found in the queen one or two players who kill the boss for them. 
---
Queen
---
4 fluxs, 
---
repair kit,
---
 large table drop plan, enyway, the most valuable plans like serum recipe, ultracite calibrated shock or emergency protocol  has a ridiculously low rate*📷*
---
2 years killing queen,  for old players the plans dont have any interest 
---
Colosus
---
Is new!!!!!
---
4 New plans, 1 new outfist, and 3 cursed weapons.....yes, the cursed weapons are useless, but are ok for get scripts,  yes, only 8 rewards table is low, I hope they increase with the time.
---
8 treasure notes but only 2 fluxs
---
no repair kits
---
   
---
at the moment, I only do colossus, at least until I have all the plans with my five characters
---
And stay off my lawn!
---
As much as I think cheaters should be banned, I gotta ask, will it just work or they going to ban others by mistake cause you know bethesda.. 
---
On ps4 BTW before I get accused, near the end of the legendary run, just 6 lvls to go... Last thing I need is to be accidentally banned cause system got confused.
---
Yea, just when I wanted to start dabbling in being a vendor too haha
---
I don’t.  I only logon if I have a few hours to spare.
---
Yea burst fire helps
---
I've been having that thought for a minute now. With the reception it got at launch, i doubt they'll do another online fallout for awhile
---
you need a shovel for them? i digged about 200 of them and never carry a shovel...
---
Mine is bugged and after the first time of selling a photo to one side or the other I’ve never gotten this daily ever again. If I go to talk to Davenport it’s just nothing. A few random lines but no quest given.
---
Guess not. They updated it I suppose
---
I’d prefer that they’re not called “veteran levels” though. In my opinion you’re not a vet until you’ve completed the main game and spent 750+ hours here.
---
That's different though, console commands are part of the game (on PC). And you're not going to get your game taken away from you for using that in a single player game. That's a gameplay choice when playing alone, but it's a risk when playing an online game. Hence why I keep telling people to go play fallout 4 if they want to fly around with hacked weapons
---
I would say yes..... But they probably just optimising due to console lagging.  Queen still does it xD
---
If you move your camp while it's still built, you get a blueprint of your previous camp, whether it's actually able to be placed is a different story.
---
You're better off moving though, check the interactive map online and pick a spot with a node you can set and extractor up on.
---
He really shouldn’t have been name Randal.
---
Oh, and it generates free atoms and SCORE points too....
---
why ask a question that the quest will likely answer
---
Nah lol You never used a shovel
---
Iam kinda dissapointed that they removed armor legendary perks, i mean yes it was poorly executed since all ammo types were only for defence purpouses, it still feels they missed the chance for improving the way ppl use characters and determinate its purpous via armor. Iam happy they add something but tbh iam not impressed with legendary PC. The stat PC feels boring, anti rad PC feels.... yea its usefull if u could survive in nuclear zone with it but problem is that i still consider as a non power armor user giving up all my armor just not fair and this PC even wont solve the problem. Iam just not impressed...
---
\+unyielding+1INT +night person + Herd mentality +strange in numbers
---
My build: 8 INT take it or leave it...
---
I'm mostly salty because I had to dissemble one of my favourite camping spots because it would've been nuked every other hour.
---
For someone who has never done meat week why don't you actually try doing meat week. We all have jobs n lives n shit too.
---
Fucks sake.
---
I guess after that Doom Eternal fiasco they are really nervous about anti cheat
---
I got the message recently that my camp couldn’t be placed so I stayed to see what was there.
---
Mole rats. Three mole rats running around.
---
Wizard of Oz my camp on those rats and let’s go. Smush them with my camp and let me play!
---
Want to add that AWOL Armaments is another underrated event over at the RobCo Research Centre!  It can help contribute towards the bots challenge, the events and has good odds of spawning a legendary or two. It's mostly Major Gutsys and Protectrons but then you can just dip into the research centre afterwards to grab an Assaultron kill or the turrets.
---
Thanks!
---
Your fresh character can easily jump between stealth sniper, commando or even bows if you felt like it as they are all perception/luck builds with decent agility.
---
With those 2 character (new one and the high level heavy guns one) you can cover most bases as the high level can swap in any melee cards without moving perks...
---
I used to run around in meat week bloody cook costume and hat with an bloodied swing speed +1str rolling pin and kill peoples brahmin at their camp. That said, i as very drunk.
---
I’ve seen the game murder my friend’s Mirelurk King. He was just pacing around camp, and all of a sudden he was flung straight up into the air by NOTHING and dropped to his death.
---
Meanwhile I’m at level 37, and my SPECIALS are *still* 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 because I don’t want to make any decisions about my build until this nerf comes out.
---
Well, your example is a huge extreme and really doesn't fit. FO1st isn't fine considering they've yet to deliver on promises made. 
---
Half the time I forget because thats kind of what happens with me. Sorry for having terrible memory. And I dont think pressing keys on a phone is exerting a lot of energy, thanks for caring about that though. 
---
I'm critical of the game because they could do so much more with it, but they consistently drop the ball. Wastelands, or whatever it was called, brought some much needed content, but its, obviously, still lacking.
---
I can like the game and still have issues with its flaws.
---
But I never would have guessed I'd be called an entitled asshole for expecting more from a huge company like Bethesda, both in additional content and them keeping on their promises.
---
Wishing pole dancing were a thing in 76.?
---
I'm sure a mini-turret mod could be added to the list. I could walk around like The Predator, particularly useful for auto-harassing the Wendigos as you concentrate on the Collosus.
---
Im a half health junkie stealth sniper and can easily pull more than my fair share of weight in end game situations.
---
You just need to build around what you want, and fyi the damage boosts from stealth are pretty OP and can make any build significantly better
---
You can find both at a bar in Whitesprings run by a robot named Bubbles. She sells all the varieties.
---
But if you get the audio bug, the fucking npcs wont say a word and there will be no subs.
---
On xb1 it occasionally does for me. Sometimes ill FT back to camp and its gold and glorious but the majority of time it just looks like a regular SAR.
---
I'm sorry people are being so rude to you. You're clearly frustrated and I can understand why you would be.
---
I can offer you the only workaround I can think of: Load into the world where your c.a.m.p. cannot be placed, open up your social menu and block a random player for the session, load to main menu and try to connect to a new server. As far as I know, the game will favor a new server that the blocked party is not in. 
---
Again, if I'm totally wrong here, someone let me know!
---
And I bet you anything WoW didn’t fuck up a main quest so badly it’s literally impossible to complete. (Looking at *you*, Ounce of Prevention)
---
Yup
---
I had this exact same issue despite no camp being where mine was. I reconnected about 8 times before I manually quit to the menu instead of pressing find new world. Loading in after that worked fine.
---
Yeah my high level has all the melee and heavy gun perks.
---
You know...
---
I've got screenshots of me and her serving drinks but it never even dawned on me she was a vendor!
---
I guess I was so impressed with finding it and taking pics it just slipped my mind. 
---
It has happened to me once in about 60 hours but it did do this to me about 8 ish times before I had to manually leave the server and then manually find a new world which worked.
---
YOU'RE WEAK
---
The worst about this game are the very disappointing subscribers to this chan. I have never seen before so many entitled crybabies.
---
I like the vomiting on the sleeping person screenshot
---
This! Searching for the last scorched who is hiding in a wall or underground🙈
---
I think your sniper will be fine as long as you spec into stealth/crits
---
I would imagine 5pm uk time when the score resets
---
&gt;GIANT garden spider 
---
Mans gotta eat, he probably committed bug genocide on your property

Sounds like a fart joke to me :-)

" **Meat Week** will now take place from Thursday, August 20 - 26. Primal Cuts events will **start** appearing at 11:00 a.m. ET that day so that you can collect some Prime **Meat** before the first **Meat**\-Cook event at noon. "
---
Source: google search (0,76 seconds) "fallout 76 meat week start time"
---
Yeah, in about 4hrs I guess
---
Well there weren’t enough girls in the Vault you see...
---
Level 84 full-health stealth sniper here, doing ~1000dmg per sneak shot with my perk cards (maxed adrenaline) and can crack off plenty of lever action rounds to loot the sbq no problem.
---
Third place is you're fired
---
I really wish u could pick what Chems u wanted to use in those
---
I'm level 75 stealth suit sniper build after I too screwed up my first character a bit. Also sided with the raiders at first.
---
I have a 3 star combat shotgun, hardened receiver, true long barrel and stinging mag, with increased damage per consecutive hit, extra limb damage and can't recall the third trait, but it takes everything out in no more than three hits up close with all my perks setup for sneak bonuses. (minus scortchbeast and Queen of course) 
---
And my main is a two shot 50 cal sniper rifle with stinging mag, increased crit damage and another trait I can't remember. I have all three rifleman Perk cards maxed and Max vats card as well, so a crit headshot usually shows up with like x2 438 damage numbers on screen or something like that, so it can do massive damage while in sneak.
---
And my in between weapon is a 3 star hardened receiver, stinging mag assault rifle that does 10% extra damage to other players, fills crit bar faster in VATS and again, a third trait I can't recall.... But with the rifleman Perk cards and sneak, it gets the same Perk bonuses as the sniper rifle.
---
All weapons are silenced
---
So long range is the 50 cal sniper and also for head shot crits, combat shotgun for up close or tight quarters and the assault rifle for mid range, clustered enemies, filling crit faster for sniper and for picking away at scortchbeats/Queen while in the air.
---
One shotgun Perk card maxed as well. I thought about shuffling things around to Max another shotgun card but it does enough damage already.
---
Also have some perks for carry weight to balance out the extra weapon (normally I'd just stick with two guns)
---
Also maxed out the Perk with the vault boy in the suit of armour that adds extra protection when not in power armour.... And maxed the usual sneak stuff in Agility like sneak, escape artist, etc.
---
So stealth sniper is certainly still viable, but if you want to fight the scortchbeast Queen and get loot, the sniper rifle alone might not be enough due to slow rebolt/reload.... Unless you land every hit, so have at least a silenced combat shotgun ready for when it lands. Then you just get up in its face and unload for a crap load of damage.
---
I have a single window without a screen and it opens to underneath my porch. I regularly spray it with a Raid barrier to keep the place from becoming Wolf Spiderville. When it doesn't work, those fuckers dart around quickly across my floor making me scream like a girl, and when it does.... well, when I get around to pulling a cradenza I have near the window out to clean under it, I'm usually greeted with 5 to 10 dead wolfspider bodies because they hid under their upon entering my house and died once the Raid God took them.
---
Uhhgggg
---
At the daily reset, of course.
---
Thanks burned out need something to do 😆

Closing someones door is the ultimate sign of respect in fallout.
---
&gt; I'm glad I play normally. I enjoy this game to much to get banned
---
Fun fact, you can get wrongfully (and accidentally) flagged by their system and become a victim of a false positive even if you play normally.
---
To server hop I always quit to menu, guess why I have never seen it.
---
Stealth commando/rifleman are really easy to interchange. Pretty much the same crit and sneak aspects and u just change the 3 rifleman for 3 commando. Done.
---
Don't have doors! Problem solved.
---
Do public events like radiation rumble and line in the sand or scorch queen.  The try is go server hop a lot and you be surprised how much exp u end up getting
---
Shrug emoji
---
It was announced as a 2 week pause between seasons which would be logical as you then have the option to have a full 4 seasons in a year if they continue in the current style after S3.
---
Using social menu often glitches to adding/removing yourself as a friend...
---
But, will it drop for consoles?
---
I don't need it, but I love carrying one around for the satisfying **THUNK**! sound it makes when you smack things in the face
---
This was the case for me last night when I finished my dailies and then someone dropped a nuke in the Bog.  I's kind of sad when you have to ask your wife if you can play for another 15-20 minutes.
---
Yeah and take your time. There’s plenty of end game grinding to do when you’ve finished all the quests and stuff, so don’t feel the need to rush through it
---
Thought that was just foe shotguns, good to know
---
In about a month after they delay it
---
Green thumbs perk give you 2 per pick
---
Thank you very much again Akarnokd :)
---
As for stealth suit you’re better off going with low health blocker/serendipity and full unyielding. You’re practically invisible with 30 agility and stealth perk. I don’t even run the stealth perk and hardly every come out of caution. With the stealth suit, unless your high health, you give up so much I the way of carry weight, accuracy, sneak and exp from intelligence. And as a sneak sniper you’re not being seen so health being low isn’t really a huge worry
---
Thanks for the responses. I think it am gonna try the floater freee grenades until i get a quad
---
I came home the other day and someone had left the door open, letting radtoads into the house. There was gunk all over the furniture and my cat was gone. Please close the doors, folks.
---
This also happens to me :( and that fucking fast travel bug... god that shit makes me wanna uninstall
---
Been making Chally Feed in preparation
---
It’s not always available. If you don’t see it, it’s not available atm
---
this is a clever idea, and less of obnoxious than a atom-stop stand in.
---
No problem, at least that means you know exactly where to find her!
---
My previous camp was next to a random event spot.
---
One day a Sheepsquatch spawned, luckily, I found it first, crippled its limbs and let the rockets do the rest.
---
&gt; Funny enough, it seems the cheaters are some of the most "dedicated" fans.
---
This was true in the last game company I worked at - cheaters tended to be true whales. We were light with the ban hammer because of this although we always fixed exploits as they came up.
---
We actually talked to our players regularly though and they would tell us about the latest cheats. Interestingly, we had a lot of PvP in our games and rival groups would regularly snitch on each other to ensure a level playing field.
---
They haven't removed fridges from the game, just from the atom shop.
---
You'll have to wait until they come back
---
Why not PA skin that gives you a minigun, War Machine skin
---
Giveitesniff
---
I don’t mind this happening every now and then, but I do mind it happening more than twice.
---
Chance is you're gonna be able to find them in every vendor thay has anywhere between 300 and 600 plans.
---
i stopped doing dailies because they felt like a chore.  Now i play the game from now and then and its way more fun
---
It's ridiculous by real world standards, but in Fallout, nukes and radiation are basically the 'magic' of the setting.
---
Why is there so mutation? Radiation*.
---
How do we solve everything? Nukes.
---
*(Yes, and FEV, which is yet more 'wasteland magic'.)
---
They added it when they removed the chance of legendary bots spawning cause we were all farming them, I thought it was pretty funny. 
---
Sometimes they spawn and can end up fighting other stuff so you might miss them but give it a try!
---
I'm always shocked people don't know about the second shovel spawn.
---
That level 12 incident was a couple of months back though. If it's not a bug, perhaps it was done in an update? Either that or maybe it glitched when that player logged off halfway through me lock picking?
---
Thanks for the quick reply. I just came back and I don't really know how a lot of stuff works that well yet.
---
Which economy?
---
Brahmin are just tasty steaks that are yet to have their full potential revealed. Kill em all!
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
I’m with you but not with #2 or #5
---
Sad part about IP bans is most people have a dynamic IP address. If they are in a heavily populated area they might not even notice the IP ban or they can call their ISP and change their set of IP for 'security reasons '
---
I'll have to ask my neighbors if they enjoy the experience.
---
I had no idea. Will have to check this out!
---
Don’t you dare pay that much for a shielded suit. Gougers on here are crazy. 
---
Market value on shielded undersuits is 300-500c. If you are on PC, I’ll make you one for free just because of this clowns audacity.
---
7 things:
---
1) how did you get your tent so high?
---
B) how do other people get up there or is this teammates only?
---
iii) I’ve run out of questions
---
Finally, nice build!!
---
It’s been two days... they said it would be later in the week
---
That really pisses me off. Why can’t they just instantly attack my camp when it loads in? Why can’t they just die from 20 tons of concrete crushing their hideous bodies and annoying cheaty teleport bullshit?
---
No worries. Stuff cycle in and out of the shop pretty regularly.
---
One also spawns on the countertop in the building now.
---
We live in hell

---
yes, this game is still in beta basically
---
Its Crazy I can melt a sb in 2 seconds , put on power armor and then it takes a whole clip to do the same thing with the same gun.
---
In addition to player vendors, a few are from questlines. Do the Van lowe quests and side quests to get a few, get some bug ones from pioneer scout daily quests.
---
You can always check the in-game timer as well
---
Place a large picture frame, and the board on top of that.
---
Stealth wont be a thing in the coming Daily Ops, the enemies will behaving enhanced perception.
---
Yes it’s viable, but you need to obviously adjust your play style and not rush into everything. It’s decent for SBQ, but you will still want a handy melee for when she finally lands. 
---
Haven’t done colosal problem yet, but my guess is it is less viable for that event.
---
Same here. The person gave me a quick warning to fat travel and dump my shit Soni would t lose it, showed up nailed me, then left goody bag. It was a pretty nice experience.
---
The second time I became wanted was also completely accidental. I was wandering around the junk yard and didn't know it was owned, picked the lock on the safe (it didnt warn me about stealing), and instantly got the notification.
---
The dude who killed me, killed me with a flaming chainsaw. It was hilarious to watch in third person.
---
Right on I'll give that a try! Thank you.
---
I don't gettery, is just to put us in the limit of doing this 3 time per server?
---
In a lore perspective, don't make sense.
---
I am more worried about making sure I have the stealth suit for the SBQ / any radiation situation. So I don’t have to rely on a Hazmat suit.
---
I’m really disappointed I missed out on the stealth suit on my main sniper.
---
No. By the way, I left a radfloater in your toilet. Later brah
---
Poisoning the crops and livestock? They livestock glow in the dark and have multiple heads! The tomatoes are covered in tumors!
---
Fly Catcher is even faster - shoot down a vertibird. Takes ca. 3 sec with a 0,50 cal
---
All things considered, it worked for me on xbox. Could you post an answer to let me know?
---
Scorched Earth with XP multipliers
---
I’m not justifying anything. The mood of the sub reflects the state of the game. It’s as simple as that. 
---
Positive experiences are still shared here, and can be highly upvoted. So saying there’s a bandwagon hate brigade who downvote anything of that kind is entirely misleading.
---
Just make a new character and follow the wastelander story.
---
I recommend you plan out your character build first
---
I’d say it’s THE build to play. Get a fixer, basic uny/AP + bloodied build and you are set.
---
Mine can do 1200+ dmg per shot to the queen, while it’s flying. (At night tho)
---
And it’s not spec for max damage possible
---
Hell yeah, and I thanked him for his service
---
events
---
Create a new character, run down to wayward, kill that guy inside, take the quest, go out, hear the overseers tape, go over to a workbench and craft a knife and a leather arm piece. Takes about 10-15 min.
---
Well it kinda depends on what level you are. Higher levels require more XP to level up. I am 280something but with suitable buffs I can get at least one level from the public events radiation rumble or line in the sand.
---
Not sure if it still applies, but I think you must know all previous modifications (treated, resistant, protective) for underarmor before you can get the plans for shielded as a drop.
---
This is part of what I am asking. Is there actually any concrete evidence of this / is an entire portion of the game just removed?
---
Lots of speculation off patch notes but any gameplay and articles with info off the PTR? Genuinely asking.
---
gave up on their writing after the 'ending' to wastelanders. Reading the OG story in 76 gave me hope they'd actually got someone decent in but that seems to be a fluke. 
---
&amp; im not hard to please, Fallout 3 has my favourite story of them all.
---
I mean, it’s not hard for a competent climber to fit through the gaps. Especially if they can jump 40ft at a time because they’re mutated.
---
Depends on your build. I’m a lvl 180 heavy full health with 9 int. slap on canned meat stew, broiled scorch beast brain and a group of 4 building team and I’ll hit a level a day in about 30min without much effort. Plus the odd lunch box (if I’m lucky will help)
---
I agree that it is lazy writing.
---
Probably because the quest engineer for this event is not a writer, and the official writer bethesda for the lore is, I don't know, on the beach.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
New character. Run down to overseer camp. Craft some armor.
---
Thanks for the info.   Nah, I'll pass.   I've done all the "kill robots" challenge except the unarmed one, and I think 14K+ robot deaths (or whatever it was) is probably enough.  :)
---
No idea, I think the two shot explosive does the most, even after furious is at max.
---
First post I’ve downloaded in a long time! Looks like it’s gonna be one of those days.
---
You would think one of the devs could give us a simple answer.
---
Yeah I went a week without it happening to me and now it’s back again.
---
A follow up: is it worth rerolling a level 80 in order to get the stealth suit? Or am I being unreasonable?
---
Is it worth losing out on the time and bullion to get it the hard way now cannot rerolling?
---
I am coming back to the game so these characters have no bullion and no bullion recipes.
---
That’s a hard pass
---
Look for Juicehead in Youtube, he did a full video on the Daily Ops.
---
I just keep 10 honey on me. Part of his reward back is some honey, so later when I have time I just top off (or end up killing some honey beasts)
---
A Rabbit!?
---
LOOK AT THE BONES!! Get the Holy Hand Grenade!
---
Fastest seem new character 
---
For non-new character is doing public event and jumping servers
---
Thank you I will check it out.
---
No
---
For robots, there's usually about 9 Liberators right by the door to 76.  Otherwise, I run over to Watoga.
---
With Monster Mash, just do it once.  I still have over 300 candies in my STASH.  My husband and I did it months ago, each switching off wearing the mask while the other killed the ghouls.
---
I do Biv's quests all the time so I keep a supply of all the different kinds of alcohol so I don't have to run around gathering ingredients and waiting for it to ferment.
---
Whenever there's a challenge involving taking workshops, I always do Billings first since the "find the monsters" spawn area is so tiny (tends to just be the house).  I never take the "important" ones like the Ammo Conversion place up north.  If I see a workshop has been taken, I glance around to see how built up it is -- ignoring if it's just CAMP items and we have a challenge to place CAMP stuff -- and take it if it seems like it was taken and then ignored.  When taking one of these taken workshops, I start the process and then run to the farthest corner of the green box (away from where I know the fast travel spawn area is) and am prepared to run if the owner comes in with a vengeance.  lol
---
Damn, I wish I could meet random people like this...
---
I have most of them...
---
On xbox.
---
Message me when you are on and if I have time I can give you what I have.
---
This guy was a gift from god
---
Multicoloured lights were ATX and released just before the Christmas lights.
---
Or maybe use the drill ride thing from the deep?
---
As of now on the PTS every Daily Op negates stealth. That could certainly change by the time they actually come out. My recommendation is to also have the Commando cards available to swap into for boss fights and things like Daily Ops, along with an auto handmade or Fixer. That will give you a DPS boost for those situations without the need to change your entire build.
---
You're never gonna catch me!
---
Does anyone just leave unlocked resource collectors so others can use them?
---
For example, at my camp I have several water purifiers that are unlocked in case someone wants some. And for a while I had an unlocked steel extractor so people could grab some.
---
This is what I've done!  Unless my main is close to leveling up anyway.  But sometimes I forget that I'm on my low-level and go charging in with her combat knife or am surprised I don't know a plan/recipe I find.  lol  But just follow with the original storyline and your levels climb like they're nothing!
---
He has spares, but generous nonetheless :-)
---
this, and taken 7-8'ish minutes if you perfect it :)
---
Naaa, with then engine the way it is, Denuvo would just make for76 unplayable.
---
I don’t even bother with it for the sbq. However it is a god send at radiation rumble and I’ve not played collosol problem yet but there maybe as well. Which is it under? Settlers or raiders?  I got mine on the quests before the raid
---
Yeah, this is one of the more ridiculous things, loading into the server anyway and seeing there's basically nothing there.  CAMPs should take precedence over trash enemies, pretty much the only things that should block them are another CAMP or a fast travel tent.
---
If they sorted that problem, they could then add a query to the server to compare the user's CAMP center with the current CAMP centers (any tents) and not place the user on a server where there's a conflict, without having to load anything.
---
Yes im still optimize the run. But what kills me are the loading screens haha
---
I was in the first Fasnacht, on my server a went well, fingers crossed today
---
1 endurance and 1 charisma would give you 11 points to play with , quality of life cards are completely unnecessary in this game
---
Use your fallout 1st tent and run line in the sand....
---
damn, didn't even realize this. Ah well at least I can make some nice Rhododendron tea lol.
---
i have the opposite problem.
---
Does anybody know anywhere I can never see these plans again. Besides quitting the game of course.
---
swear these things are everywhere for me. at player vendors, in suitcases at trainstations. Hell often I can't leave my camp without tripping over a bag in my doorway that has some or other mounted plan in it.
---
I think I could change my TSE fixer to auto and be viable. I need the Commando cards but that isn’t a terrible cost.
---
I hope it’s for all who have visited at least once. It needed to be this way since Wastelanders released! I’ve probably wasted at least 2000 caps just traveling back and forth to those places (and I’m not even maxed on reputation with them), I’m sure that number is a lot higher for others.
---
I'm level 331 and I work so you have to be smart.
---
I try to end a day being 3/4 or more towards the next level so the next day is an easy level if I am short on time.  I can easily gain a level in a couple hours if I commit to it.  Not with anything more than 5% well rested and team bonus
---
If Its a work day and cant play very long I'll make a new character and level as fast as I can.  Then I use that new character for a couple days as it's easy to level the first few levels.
---
The nw ones are the time consuming pain in the butt.
---
If it's anything more than build a camp 3 times or take a picture it's a joke.
---
You can do the gain a level with a new character and brush wookie a match or two if you have time
---
I don't trust you, why is your mouth watering, you have napkin around your neck and you're holding a knife and fork....?
---
So what does Meat week mean gameplaywise? I missed it last time.
---
was a short special. prob going to have to wait till next time it's in atom store again.
---
Possibly try to build it in camp menu, then it will take you to an'unlock in store' purchase button.
---
I’ve seen some factions on r/FO76roleplay
---
In my experience this only works out of power armor. My power armor wearing character only runs in a straight line and I cannot turn him. The other three characters that do not wear power armor can steer the fear.
---
Join a crew , our BOS group has at least 6 people who will pop on NW whenever anyone wants to play. I’m sure we are the crews of four you hate lol , join us!
---
It is settlers. You can still get it and side with raiders but you have to do some settlers quests before you pick raiders. I did not, and now I have to grind rep and spend 4000 bullion to get it... :(
---
I’m level 260 and missed one night leveling up just because my game crashed and I didn’t feel like loading in again. I’m not positive but I think after a certain level it doesn’t get harder so higher levels shouldn’t have an issue.
---
Are you using Agent perk ? This perk reduced the Prices for traveling
---
Goddamn graham murdered my sloth the other day. Couldnt even save him from his immortal ass.
---
Has nothing to do with a glitch. People are just completing their daily challenge of buy 3 things from a vendor.
---
Daily challenge.
---
Buy from seller or vendor 3/3
---
We do it fir the daily score "Buy or sell 3 items to another player".
---
You know, I may have been in the Order of Mysteries too long, but this seems suspicious.
---
I looked at the picture before reading and didn’t know what creature this was. I like it
---
3 -4 hours is normal for 'maintenance'
---
Well I've already completed it nearly so I don't focus on it a lot hahaha
---
You can jump and place the tent above the tent. It does interfere with SBQ air traffic control, so don’t be that guy.
---
Most likely people are buying 1 ammo at a time to complete daily challenge for the score xp.
---
I am just curious, what does this tool do? I mean I know the usual cheats with aimbot or wallhacks but that isn't really needed in FO76, so what does it do? Something with the loot?
---
Or if you use a 50 cal sniper and a hardened receiver assault rifle, the same rifleman Perk cards work for both and the assault rifle can fire off rounds pretty quickly..... Which leaves you with more Perk cards/slots for other things and not have to switch around cards when changing weapons. Legendary effects on top also help of course.
---
I do this. Buying bulk stuff doesn't give you 3/3 so you have to buy 2 individual pieces of ammo then whatever for the 3rd for it to count
---
Not necessarily a glitch, but people working on completing the “Buy or Sell Three Items from Player” daily atom challenge. I myself normally do this as well. Buy three rounds, one at a time, then buy the remaining pool if it an ammo I type I use.
---
I just basically stumbled into my bloodied build.  Found a bloodied weapon I wanted to try it out, turned out it was great, then over time I just naturally adapted my build to fit the nerd rage and the low life dodge perk, and the mutation.  Still working on the armor, because I'm lazy, and it already seems good enough heh.
---
I'm of two minds about this, on one hand it would be nice for everyone to have free fast travel there once they have discovered it, you go back and forth alot during the 30+ day rep grind. On the other hand, it would also be a nice incentive for getting to a certain rep level, maybe not max rep though as that may be a bit too much.
---
Wtf taming pets????????
---
The quests cancel out cap spend anyway, but not bad if true.
---
buying 3 things doesn’t work because Bethesda. You have to make 3 individual purchases to make the daily work. Pretty dumb if you ask me.
---
If you are expecting something amazing you will be disappointed
---
Honestly; a mega-event that involved brotherhood troops gathering slowly over a few hours, expedited by players doing a series of side quests or resource donations; culminating in a "siege the fissure-cave" NPC+Player coop event would be baller.
---
Think the March of Liberty Prime in fallout 3, but with tons of players mixed in with several squads of Knights.
---
Similar to; I wish theyd have a coop-PvE "wave defense" mode to queue into like they have nuclear winter; be a replay of the final battles of the brotherhood or firebreathers against the scorched, no win-cons, just slowly scaling rewards the longer you survive.
---
I was wanted yesterday and it keep switching back and forth. Wanted/not wanted. Maybe it was the junk or just a visual glitch????
---
They’re doing it to complete the daily SCORE challenge. Usually “buy or sell 3 items from another player”. You’re probably seeing two transactions for 1 unit each, and a third for the remainder of the ammo you’re selling.
---
Pfft... I can barely place my stupid tent on the ground!!
---
Is there an exact place for this? I have it work for me 50% of the time roughly
---
Haven’t run the event because I’m a console pleb but would swapping medic pumps for jet packs solve the “ everyone keeps dying “ issue, I’m seeing repeatedly for the last few days ? Do we need jet packs in the mine ?
---
Will now open all your doors.
---
Yeah, and we constantly throw nukes at a landscape to kill a stupid bat, I think we cope with doing this
---
Prepare for opportunity 😊
---
It’s fun for a day or 2.
---
Yeah, that was probably me. Sorry.
---
Scorched best area Spawn is around Morgantown airport (in my opinion) 
---
15 creatures can be killed in leader of the pack event (solo killing all wolves)
---
Bots I go for the liberators around vault 76
---
Yes we do.
---
Same here tbh
---
Hopefully junk and not a visual glitch, cuz that would suck thinking you're not wanted and then bam! Yer dead.
---
Almost. Primal Cuts starts one hour earlier.
---
I dont have either but that's a great idea I've got a mission now lol thanks
---
All I expect is a cool community hang out event like the fasnacht. I loved it.
---
Colossal probably wont last long in its current configuration. Its only being run because its new. In a month it will be abandoned and people will go back to doing sbq.
---
I will for sure,  I'm working atm...
---
I've only done the event once, and in power armor, and it seems like I did have some control over which direction I ran.  And then I luckily positioned myself with a railing behind me, somewhere on the middle platform I think, so every time I got feared, I just spun around and ran in place and then turned around and started shooting again when it was over. It was a fun event, but now I'm completely out of ammo!
---
Not just knowing what buffs to stack; but also what areas of the map can get you a quick pike of XP in a minute or two.
---
Quite a few spots where ghouls, or mole miners, or supers, or bots, can all be aggroed in an area instantly, and funneled toward a narrow space.
---
Like their is one area to the northeast(?) Of Welch that you can aggro the whole town at once, after which it's just hold down minigun for a few second, and there ya go, 2 minutes and nearly 1000xp 
---
Or the bottom floor of the FEV room at westtek; can aggro the whole building and have them all dead in seconds, or Huntersville' northern gate.
---
You’re thinking of a different game, maybe NV
---
Please!!!!!!
---
"Useless hot lead"
---
I think you mean *delicious* hot lead.
---
That sounds like a solid plan.
---
You’re lucky getting the reactive plates. I’ve been trying to get the Optimised servos and reactive plates for months of queen drops. So like 2-3 a day for a couple of months now and still not got them..
---
Its called a magazine, not a clip.
---
For the lockpick one, too: spawn under the M in Morgantown. Leave the building it puts you in, you'll see a bank to your right. Go in the front door; in the vault, along the floor, are five safes, any of which might be pickable. If they aren't, leave the bank, turn left, and walk around the corner. You'll see a hole in the wall on your left; go in and up the steps and you'll find a safe in a hallway on the floor that usually can be picked.
---
Maybe they'll do it at the same time they patch the animal spawns for meat week
---
Be happy they are eventually purchasing a bunch! I normally receive notice for 3 x 1 cap purchases without the bunch...
---
Seeing you run around with a ski sword is fucking hilarious, ngl.
---
I'm so sorry, guy. My A.D.D was playing up again. That's Aggressive Douchebag Disorder. Bad times.
---
I'd prefer that the option meant it would keep retrying until a server could be found.  Even landing on different servers it can sometimes take upwards of 5 hops to place my base.
---
Okay so I read through the comments and here is one not mentioned.  One of the semi-regular weeklies - as well as dailies - is “build x in a workshop or camp”. My camp budget is maxed out so no matter what, building in my camp is out. And since grabbing a workshop is almost always either a daily or a weekly, I do this at a workshop. I always pick Billings homestead because it’s easy to clear out, there’s flat land and there’s razor grain if I need to grab crops to replant.
---
So once you have your workshop, start building a structure. The weekly requirement is usually like, build 5 floors or walls (okay done) build 5 stairs or doors (ok done) build 5 containers or shelves (ok done - do this inside the structure) build 20 lights or electrical connectors (ok I use the basic electrical posts and just put them on the wall or floor). Add to this the your normal dailies (build 10? Wall or floor decorations) by building 10 floor mats or stuffed animals or whatever else you want.... build 5 walls (if not already done) ... build 5 roofs ... etc 
---
When you are done, you blueprint that structure. 
---
You only need to actually build this once. 
---
After that? When you take over a workshop, enter build mode, go to blueprints, build this monstrosity and boom, you are done.
---
I thought it was only 2 hours , and you are correct the holotape only shows the world timer not your personal one. We have three guys in our crew running 7 minute silos so we hit C A B in that order server hop and the next guy starts at C , by the time the third man pops his third nuke we server hop and dude 1 is ready to go
---
I don’t do it, but there must be a YouTube video
---
I'm just really excited to cook y.... I mean cook for you!
---
PRAISE
---
Or get the Fasnacht Collectron for your CAMP. I'm swimming in pre-war food of all types, especially the common challenge ones: bubblegum and alcohol.
---
Yeah I'm *totally* going to lay down and fall asleep on something called the Tenderizer table. /s
---
Make a new char pick up card pack inside starting vault boom lvl2...
---
Oh cool...see you there then :-)
---
Nonsense! Can I off you some relaxing tea! It's a real experience booster!
---
As far as I know, it has very wide the functionality from seeing everything (mobs, items, npcs and such, fully customizable) on screen to remote killing stuff, infinite ammo, auto looting, customizable SPECIAL and other stuff
---
I think a great option they could add is "place next time" so I can make do without my base til I need it. And dont end up in the same server for 10 minutes straight
---
This doesn't work unfortunately.
---
Kinda wondering if you were trying to log in while the person who was obstructing your camp was server hopping :(
---
I've also seen this message plenty of times, hit stay, only to find no sign of a camp anywhere near where mine was, back when my camp was could be seen from the spawn at Foundation
---
Is that true?? I always thought your CAMP spot gets deleted if you stay in the world :O I guess only if you choose to place your CAMP somewhere new?
---
Rather use a fixer with commando or a decent handmade tho. A lot more dps for the end game
---
I like to look at your camp.
---
And have been, before my cheating days.
---
Its definitely one of the useless specials. Shame its good so many good perks gated behind it.
---
I find the research centre next to flatwoods good for robots. 3 protectrons a bunch of mr handys and maybe an eyebot or 2. Then up to 76 for the spider bots
---
Definitely 3, took [this](https://imgur.com/a/hWFMvZw) screenshot just now as my missus had just launched a nuke.
---
I’m a mic snob , I walk up and start talking. “Can you hear me “.... “jump if you can hear me” .... “ok give me a minute to drop you some stuff it’s a lot don’t run away “
---
And that should tell you that you're overpricing your ammo. Just stick to 1 cap per, and you, too, will sell the bunch. ;-)
---
I took a fusion core in the water park this morning and then a lower level person in power armor came by and I felt awful.  I dropped about 10 fusion cores between 60-80 percent full and shot them until they picked them up.  I’ll be honest, I did it so I would stop feeling like an ass, it had nothing to do with me being a good person.
---
And turn off my decontamination shower
---
They do play it. They just have very low standards of what constitutes quality.
---
And my axe!
---
Thats what I do whenever I harvest someones crops. It seems fair and polite, ive notoced other players doing this at my own camp with crops too.
---
Yeah it’s 3 for the world, your personal timer that it doesn’t show is only 2 I believe
---
Don't be silly... We just called it that because of the Meat Week theme! Why our head masseur is even named Butcher Pete!
---
Isn't it great?
---
Right as im reading this and logging in... It happens to me.....🤦
---
...I need ~~an adult~~ Grahm!
---
For the building ones, build something that has all objects on it and then blueprint it.
---
I always feel like a hero whenever I cut it off during the event.
---
This is the real answer right here.
---
That’s a really cool idea, but honestly, not knowing that I’d figure the typical response would be assuming that you locked the door because you’re at max caps or don’t understand locked doors.
---
If they are banning now, that means they detected months ago and just sat there collecting account names for a while.
---
I would anticipate plenty of PvP opportunity after each of Grahm's cook outs during meat week
---
Following the event run around doing the pistol finger dance and it's pretty much guaranteed some one will take a shot at you
---
Ahh, I will have to check that, I hope thats the case.
---
But stay with me here...... NUKES!!!
---
I am a bounty taker. IF i see you have a bounty, even if it's 5 caps, I am gonna take you out.
---
My enclave uniform is not just for show. We bring law to the lawless wasteland.
---
At a 8 player full campfire tales event yesterday, A player with 5 cap bounty showed up. I did not hesitate when i saw him. A few in the head did the job
---
Other players looked at me and a few angry/confused emotes. That was all. I could feel the respekt.
---
I needed to apologise today to someone after letting his pet death claw out... Though tbf I was low on life and looking at somewhere to both repair my armour and weapons after a run that had turned into a long hike (I live overweight, its a lifestyle choice, as are my hoarder tendencies). I ran in, repaired and turned around just to see the death claw disappearing out the door....
---
Places camp next to the wayward, the most popular spot for new players in the entire map.
---
Then complains why that spot is occupied on every server.
---
FYI, The game has load the server assets before it can check if you spot is occupied or not.
---
Move your camp to another spot ffs.
---
I have a pretty big house with lots of stuff in it and after moving my camp once it was pretty much all one big blueprint.
---
This is the only one I like because it brings people to my camp and I go see theirs.
---
There's around 3 or 4 shovels in the area including inside the building.
---
I'm on pc.My ign is 1Atlas25,ty
---
Hmmm ... sounds like something a commie would say.
---
Mine is behind Fort Defiance and the frequency of attacks is enough to dent the pocket book
---
Nah it’s definitely different , if I server hop to a clean server with three silos gtg I still end up having to wait on my timer , it’s a hassle
---
You get 2 Veg week
---
Lmao
---
This worked!
---
Same pgriff used to hang at Bolton greens with the rest if the ...er .. crew?
---
The real question is if it’s going to be broken or not.
---
Mid September they have said since the start and they also said the season is 76 days, sep14 is the 76 day.
---
Lol ofcourse it will be broken
---
Basically there's an event every 15 minutes or so to get "Primal Cuts" of meat for the BBQ.  
---
Got to the event, play the oil drum, then kill things until the Primal legendary shows up, which you promptly murder too.  
---
The event rewards give you the meat, between 2-4 units if memory serves.  
---
Every hour Grahm hosts the cookout, where we drop off the meat, collect greens for the salad, clean up Chally's "stinky piles" and give Chally its special feed if you've made/once you have the plans to make some.  
---
People also need to play the drums for ambiance, turn the spit to keep things cooking, and put out brush fires that pop up.  
---
During all of this, a bar at the top is filling. Once it's full we win, but it will decay over time. The drums and the spit reduce the decay and each activity adds to the bar.  
---
Prizes are usually some ammo, some food, I think some caps, a shot at some fancy plans this year, and some part of the Chef's outfit or the Tenderizer.  
---
All and all it's a pretty fun event.
---
All of my ammo is already at 1 cap (.308, .45, .50, plasma, gamma, shotgun ... etc.)
---
Only ammo I have for more than a cap are fusion cores (100% at 80 caps) and plasma cores (100% at 30 caps) and those sell, but the ammo sits
---
I use 5.56 and fusion cells, so those don't hit the vendor
---
Speed run my fav farm loop for leggos.
---
As a FO76 veteran, I'd wager a prediction: if you join a server and find half a dozen (or more) one-player event teams, you'll see all of those guys AFK'ing at the event. I know because I might be one of them while I'm asleep or at work.
---
I use an easy method to stack those tents. Basically, after placing the first one, and jumping to place the second tent, I stand on the suspended tent and stand on the top and as close to the edge as possible. Now you go to place your third tent, and pull it as close to you as possible (on PS4 I think it’s with L or R1). If you’re standing on the back edge, you’ll see that third tent glow green with the stairs underneath you. When you place it, you won’t fall down. Then just rinse and repeat.
---
And yeah, it would only be accessible to myself or teammates. 
---
Un-asked question: how did my ally get up there? I have no idea
---
https://youtu.be/GxWgnoRjZxQ
---
Im hoping free travel starts at Friendly or maybe even Neighbourly and it act as a 'Thank You' for choosing your faction for the vault raid as you pretty much are guaranteed to be there on completion. Of course it would also become available for the other faction later but only after you've done more work to make up for minor betrayal.
---
I like keeping all of my appendages, good sir. No hacking and whacking on me!
---
This is great for people who maxed out rep already and only go to Foundation because their gold machine is outside rather than requiring a second load screen.
---
i mean to him he probably thinks any good junk you have is better than a few extra caps. thank bethesda for that
---
I 'may' have enjoyed a stay at that fine establishment
---
I like to think of nuking the mineshaft as hitting two birds with one stone. You get to summon the colossus while also removing the ruble in front of the entrance.
---
Run Away!!!
---
It's fantastically satisfying! I was however a bit disappointed to learn that it doesn't count as a weapon for the kill scorched with "X" weapon Atom challenge
---
Meat week is a non-political event. Stop on by, I would be delighted to cook with you!
---
There are also Scorched parts in a jar in a hangar at Morgantown airport
---
We live in a world without reprocussion. Bethesda doesn’t *need* your money.
---
Therefore they don’t care.
---
Sorry, poor choice of words, what I meant was, I assumed the timer was 3h, same as the silos, not that they shared a cooldown. but yeah, it does suck having to wait, regardless of what the personal cooldown is. I really hope its only 2 hours though, as that would mean I could space launches out a bit and throw encryptid in somewhere in the middle and possibly have cooldowns coming off at the right time.
---
Yeah, rather crashy recently, needs another patch I guess
---
Opened all the water purifiers at a water farm camp... My bounty was something insane like 175. When someone finally came to kill me I respawned and invited him to enjoy some sweet free water. I like seeing how high my bounty can get before I get killed... For science.
---
I'm on ps4
---
Yeah, sure you completed the run and didn't know about this daily challenge
---
They might as well just wait till next week now.
---
Had the same thing yesterday. 10 or more times. First was like cool people really like my camp spot then I spawnd in to a server with a same camp as one of the first servers and I was like fuck it I’m going home lol
---
I personally guarantee that your turn at the table would be enjoyed!
---
I've been playing since about a week and a half before Wastelanders update came out, back around April I think?
---
Anyways, I played a bit of the game before the settlers and raiders came in, and even with just the NPC Robots, I was enjoying the game. Wastelanders basically doubled the content. Though I never finished the game through before the update, so maybe it was repetitive or short, I dunno.
---
But yes, I've been enjoying it. And although it has stuff you can pay real money with, I at least appreciate that it's all optional as well as the subscription is optional.
---
I prefer to pay for a game once and then just play, NOT pay for a game and then keep paying more every month to keep playing a game I just paid $60 for.... They're out there, they know who they are, MMORGPLGBTQrstuv...... Wxy'zed.
---
Having things optional and cosmetic, rather than being needed to progress or keep playing, makes me more willing to give some extra money for these optional things by choice. 
---
But I digress.
---
Fun game.
---
so I'm not the only one who is having these issues?!
---
If you have a door to keep enemies out use a powered door and put the number on the outside. People can get in but enemies can't. Your door will always be closed 😆
---
No air conditioner is available angry person. Keeping two doors across the house open creates a draft. Up your survival game.
---
The respawn bug on PC has been really noticeable for a lot of my runs... I hope that you guys get it soon but it wouldn't be the worst thing if they find a way to fix it first... Though they probably won't.
---
Yes. This is between two characters which I’ve completed all Wastelanders quests with; also for the traveling back and forth for dailies, and for gold exchange .
---
OMG! That sounds better than Fasnacht, why are we not seeing as much hype about this as we did about Fasnacht?
---
I know free stuff is great and all but lets have a reality check here.
---
The alternative is they stop adding FREE content because you know, it costs money to employ people to make that content.
---
Do you work for free?
---
I dont crash I times in an hour ,but VYad twice in couple hrs yesterday, once during Colossus event. CTD just now loading in to do a trade.
---
The last time they did increased score challenges, it was dailies only. As for when, I would assume at noon EST.
---
I don’t mess with the work benches on public servers anymore. 95% oh the time Ive built up a work bench I get the pvp player that just wants to kill you, and doesn’t want the workbench. Not worth my time
---
This is good. Blueprinting works and now I know.
---
Maybe for getting to neutral status at the least. At most... cooperative status in my opinion.
---
It's that head-caving clank and the sound just carries this "Did he just hit me with a shovel?!" expressiveness to it.
---
Really? Aw, that's a shame.
---
I'm still trying to decide between the Shovel and the Pick Axe as my backup melee weapon. They're both pretty good, and swinging the Shovel with Martial Artist on just a hoot to watch, but the Pick can really make a mess of people.
---
Oh okay. I didn’t wanna complete the weeklies if they in a few hours could have double potential. 
---
But even the paints which are the vanilla recolor aren't just replaceable skins. That should be for sure. I was NOT happy when I recently bought that paint set and had to redo all 4 vending machines.
---
Semantics, but ok
---
Sorry, I stole all your stuff and sold it for chems caps...
---
Turns out she wanted it to scrap for junk
---
Its had a few problems after launching on PC like respawn bug and Earle going through the floors\walls so it wouldnt surprise me if it was pushed back again.
---
When the dailies reset. Always when the dailies reset.
---
This because it would be: login, fast travel somewhere after about three tries, then log out.
---
It's been repeated a fair number of times, so the veterans are probably quietly anticipating stocking up on easy Treasury Notes and mini-hoarde mode events for SCORE xp, but the actual event itself is something we've done before a few times.
---
It's great to see some excitement though, it is the most fun event we've had, in my opinion.
---
Sucks. Sounds like you need a new camp location. Some places are amazing for camps and well allot of other people think that too. I ran into this problem allot to the point i just found another place. Can stumble on some really cool new places if you do this. I mean i loved my waterfall camp but i like my camp being placed way better lol. Feel for you hope it works out for you.
---
Word of warning, after you get the recall card, don't load it into the terminal right away. The fight is hard, and needs multiple 50+
---
You stopped playing a month ago and since then nothing has changed, grind wise. So you’ll probably burn yourself out again
---
This is the way
---
I see a bounty and I don't care how many caps I spend fast traveling.
---
[When you hear the whistle of the cactus man](https://youtu.be/OaKH9bywzgQ) over voice, you'll know I'm on your tail.
---
You probably jinxed us with your foolishness
---
Meh to each their own.
---
I suppose I should clarify that I also don't play bloodied, junkie or any mutations or health/stat degrades from norm. Max health and everything all on weapons, armour and perks for each. Attack from range and kill with one shot before anything peeps, or turn them into mist with point blank combat shot to the head.
---
I can take one level 60+ head on, maybe two in a row, but three or more, I won't stimpack fast enough and have to escape artist or simply die, lol.
---
Never tried the Fixer yet. Had plenty, previous character had the plans. Never had the interest.
---
Meat weeks for everyone but I think its dependent on if Colossal Problem gets launched or not (looking like not).
---
Animals won't load in.
---
Ah so it was more frequent than Fasnacht, which I guess is only a once a year thing?
---
Honestly, I prefer it to Fasnacht. I mean, I like Fasnacht, but chumming around with Grahm during this is pretty fun and the event overall is a blast.
---
I think people are just a little fixated on Earle Williams right now. Enthusiasm'll build over the weekend.
---
This is where I'd love automatic doors ala grocery story style, the powered doors just aren't don't add enough functionality.  It's once in a blue moon someone actually shuts the door at my  base.
---
Word. As some one in that situation i have learned all these tricks. Going to be harder to do some of the dailies when they shaft us with the nerf though.
---
Ha, I just do it for lulz, didn't think people would actually shoot back at you over finger guns.
---
Frigging Americans are crazy.
---
You can only get 150 per day, I do hate all the limits though
---
I recently have had way more crashes. Driver failure from admin reports (nvidia). Disabling fast startup seems to have fixed it.
---
Im going to have to respectfully disagree. New Vegas is the best because it is all about tracking down the idiot that shot you in the head. Then you go and fight a war
---
How can we have any pudding if we don't eat our meat?
---
Level up: Make a new character- choose charisma- get extra supplies from Laney (or whatevs her name is), kill liberators down the hill, go to moonshiners shack and the lumber mill to kill ticks, wixon homestead to kill scorched, head to overseer’s camp and do the miscellaneous tasks- this should level you up but if not head into the Wayward- kill batter and agree to do what Duchess wants (with a charisma of 2+ you can ask for extra supplies) 
---
Eat Pre-War food: Can do perk is a godsend for this one.
---
I don't think people get the sarcasm and the shade i'm throwing on all the "I'm leaving" posts
---
Shrug and go launch a nuke at Earle? Best I've got.  
---
But yeah, the change'll help with regards to things like this. It's kind of a bummer when that happens.
---
Oh didn’t know. Thanks!
---
If only we had access to suits made for excavation...
---
Agreed! It's a great fight! My last run yesterday was just me (lv 205 or so) and my teammate who had just switched to a lv 47 alt. We didn't know it would be just us though. Gotta say I'm glad I have a "magic" minigun. Anyway I run a bloodied build and was dying a lot because I've yet to find a good place to stand where wendigos can't get me. every time I respawned I just saw my friend running and emoting with ALL of the wendigo spawns chasing him. There had to be 25+. I was laughing so hard it was so ridiculous. Definitely a fun addition to the game... Though I can't imagine doing it with just the two of us without that broken magic weapon damage tbh.
---
Ayyy love big d
---
Lol love this community
---
Just making fun of the people announcing that they are leaving
---
When did they say the season was 76 days?
---
All I saw is on the first day of the season they said their first season will run for 10 weeks.
---
Thank you, this is helpful. Though without data scraping it'll never be more then a quess. Still better then nothing tho
---
But you'd have to move your CAMP for that? Unfortunately wouldn't work for the (small percantage of) players like me that have put a butt ton of time into their camp and can't just pick up and go
---
Thanks. Have a good day at work.
---
That's the spirit, lol.... See you out there, maybe. Mooo hooo haw haw haaaa!
---
Haha good idea! 
---
But yeah it just takes out all the fun. 
---
If you could in theory kill her in a few seconds why not do it in a private server? Just curious really.
---
Erm okay? I mean believe what you want I was aware of the challenge just not why people where doing it with ammo
---
hmm... how would I do that, in case it's my problem?
---
Alright [Cameron Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77acOyoT-d8)
---
It is a bios setting.
---
Don't tell me what to do [hoards 90rw shovels]
---
I approve of your lifestyle choices
---
Got to love people's google skills
---
Leather coats are a rare reward from Mire dailies and events.
---
You can check admin logs to see why it crashed
---
why the fuck they call it ops then, it should be called shooting arcade
---
I dont mind at all if it happens once, but when it returns me to the same server 2x+ times in a row that is a problem with an easy solution.
---
Hahaha, hope all the dupers and ammo blueprinters get permabanned. Goodbye!
---
Just remove your door and make a mob barrier. Much less frustrating.
---
That’s not really semantics. Primal cuts is part of meat week.
---
I don't run travel agent and I fast travel to opposite sides of the map all the time. I still have to spend caps at vendors all the time cause I got the limit.
---
Wasn't me, I don't go in houses. I just look in all the windows, steal the potatoes and leave.
---
Dick cheese is what I like
---
Itll just remove your camp and put it back exactly like it was when you find a server where your camp can be placed. It doesn't delete you camp
---
the nerf barely is going to affect those magic/glitch/hack weapon types so you're going to experience 30s kills anyway.
---
I heard that the new balance patch is really going to hurt riflemen
---
oh terrific placement.
---
love it
---
Black widows can kill you, so yeah they gotta go. My neighbor growing up died from a black widow bite. I don't kill every spider I encounter, but anyhing huge or resembling a black widow has to go.
---
Very similar to this one is the Pumpkin House daily. Get 10 pumpkins from behind the house. Done in 60 seconds. Rewards aren't great but it's quick
---
If you are getting a maintenance warning it's just a world closer. Just server hop and you're fine
---
I also heard it is only specific affixes. Either way I enjoy playing it. I have a hammer swinger to fall back on if it is unplayable, but I find that unlikely.
---
Yeah I see what you mean. But these dudes typically run bloodied as well. 
---
If that’s needed just a little for now I’m happy.
---
Nuke the mine to clear the rocks! Just not on Xbox or PS4 tho.
---
It's dumb, but it's new content.  Bet the overseer is just over the moon, seeing as how she ripped us on the first nuke.  Sorta takes away from their own story crafting.  Beyond the explosives, we should just use the big drill and call it a day even.  Using a nuke on a mountain makes no sense.  Either nothing happens, or the hollow mountain collapses, but rubble isn't cleared all the way inside.
---
Speaking of doors. I cant find my red rocked garage door.
---
Lol, this. Cya
---
It's an optional part of it, I'm aware. You do not need to do primal cuts to participate in meat week.
---
Tbh I expect something like this. I heard it's a good afk event. Most people on the drums will be afk. But still no problem. For me it's the mass of people in one area that I like. Some interactions, trades or just hang around a bit instead of running solo though the wasteland.
---
Because of my ADHD I've taken steps to narrow my gaming down to 3 games, 1 xbox, 1 pc, 1 mobile. Rocket League, EVE Online, and Animation Throwdown. These 3 I have played for years and I don't see myself quitting any time soon :) Any other games seem to come and go.
---
Those are yesterday’s dailies. 
---
Also, pretty sure only dailies are being doubled.
---
Thanks, sounds like fun(ish). Maybe I will try it.
---
Makes a lot of sense. I'd imagine it's the "win at all costs" mentality. I wonder if it's the same group who whales hard on P2W mobile games.
---
An optional part is still part. 
---
Does Primal Cuts occur at anytime other than Meat Week?
---
Guess we’ll have to see it for our selves
---
that's not how magic weapons work. bloodied or otherwise, they'll kill the queen in 10 seconds flat regardless.
---
For me its kind of the opposite. I usually just leave all my doors open, then there's the random that shows up and closes them all, WHILE I'm standing there on my own workbench.lol
---
I think it's anything harder hitting, with how damage stacks now its being pulled down farther than most to my understanding. Slow and strong will be hurting for dps (again just my understanding not in the pts)
---
And yeah I'm sure it won't be unplayable, just might not be as viable as you'd like. But l it's easy enough to switch to commando if you wanted, or like you said play your other toon
---
Why tho?
---
They changed that about a year ago
---
Why did you sit for a half hour? If you are spinning that long you should restart. Something is wrong.
---
If you were surprised by the nerfing ... sorry :)  They have been talking about rebalancing the game for quite some time.  Incase you aren't aware, a complete re-balance is still in the schedule.
---
I think it's safe to assume with ANY game:
---
1. Players will find way's to combine and break the game that the designers didn't anticipate
---
2. As these become more widely used and abused, the designers will decide to do something about it.
---
3. Updates will come out balancing things so that way of breaking doesn't work so well anymore.
---
So basically any min-max build you find and like, just assume eventually it'll go away.  And remember: THIS IS A GOOD THING.
---
Min-max breaks games, sorry.  The best games on the planet are those which are extremely well balanced, so it's about skill, not luck and grinding.
---
Magic weapons and damage nerfs are two different issues. Magic weapons are exploiting how the system registers damage, and I've seen no indication if/when this will be fixed.
---
The damage nerf may not affect magic weapons.
---
If that's the case, then good friggin' luck getting 1k dmg on the queen before it continues to get melted.
---
Careful what you wish for.
---
Double bonus if you also have the chew bubblegum quest.
---
Sadly, yeah, I agree - with how often we've said it would work better with a vendor screen, I'd find it difficult to believe that they just.. didn't think of it. Especially since the converter object is two parts - the animated converter itself, and then the standard terminal tacked on next to it (which isn't shown in the preview pictures).
---
My bet is they probably -intended- to use a vendor interface, but changed it at the last minute for behind the scenes technical reasons... like server stability or preventing duping. :(
---
I think im gonna move my camp near that tameable spawn in the corner of the map so if my pet disappears I can just grab a new one asap
---
Bubba?
---
One of the two farms has corn the other has razorgrain.  If the workshop is claimed stay away from the razorgrain if you dont want to engage in pvp.
---
Well, i got some russian Kosmonaut lady in my camp and she often comes into my red rocket home to play my bass - even while i sleep and when the door is closed! Of course she will not close the door behind her.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS6chrslAfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS6chrslAfo)
---
To flex,or to help others get easy kills if they get enough hits in before she falls,and that's nothing anyway I joined the imposter sheep event yesterday and It literally ended a minute after it went live,I've never seen one of them go down so quick
---
West Tek will usually have a 3 star super mutant as well in the back.
---
Yes, today. It starts an hour earlier.
---
Magic weapons, hacked weapons and legacy weapon all still tear arse on the PTS, if anything they will dial the nerf down a touch before release
---
It doesn't delete your c.a.m.p. if you join the world where yours can't be placed. It just doesn't exist on this server until you change servers or choose to relocate.
---
You're being called an entitled asshole because you're acting like an entitled asshole.
---
Telling them to strip away daily limitations has nothing to do with any promises the company has made.
---
It's purely based on your own personal wants rather than what's good for the game so spare me the victimhood mentality.
---
Please educate me, based on principled positions, how my analogy doesn't fit this conversation. 
---
Weird, you said they were lazy.   Weird, you said they made a promise to add more content into the game.  Weird, you followed that up with saying that they added more content into the game with Wastelanders.
---
It's almost as if there's a roadmap that you could look at and see that they have plans to add MORE CONTENT into the game and we could all bypass this shitshow of absolute ignorance on your part to try and mask your entitled complaints with some fake posturing about how you just want what's best for the game and how much better the game could be if only they just listened to you.
---
Also, source me on the FO1st promises that you're specifically talking about because the only things I can find out about this are bug-related issues that are seemingly fixed now as I've not had any issues with my FO1st perks.
---
I don’t understand this. I don’t understand the locked doors at all.
---
We’ve seen these posts from the start and I still don’t understand. To me it’s asinine but hey so is this comment..
---
Bubba’s green brother...
---
Yup. Anyone with a power armor build should be running casual. Anytime you’re out of PA is usually to either buy/sell or craft. Casual gives you +3 int +3 charisma, which is perfect. 
---
All my armor is Unyielding, Ultralight, with 2 Acrobat pieces (I’m used to being in PA yo, I jump off high stuff) and 3 WWR. I think I’ve got 1 charisma piece, and several Int pieces. 
---
I’m at ~38int and 25 charisma when I leave PA, great for crafting and just hitting the charisma cap for vendors so I don’t even need hard bargain.
---
I’m not sure I get what you mean?
---
If magic weapons are nerfed as well it will
---
Become even easier to hit 1k damage before she dies..? What am I missing in your response?
---
New character: choose charisma, talk to laney (or whatever her name is) don’t lie with a charisma of 2 you can ask for extra supplies, kill the liberators down the hill, go to moonshiners shack and lumber mill to kill the ticks, kill scorched at wixon homestead, go to overseer’s camp and the miscellaneous stuff. This should be enough to level you up but if it’s not go to the wayward, kill batter, go through the dialogue with duchess to accept her quest. 
---
If you don’t want to keep the character delete it, then you can redo these steps when challenges reset.
---
magic weapons are bugged weapons. they're not getting nerfed, not exactly. their damage might be nerfed but the end result stays the same: they'll kill the queen in 10 seconds flat.
---
or less.
---
If the overall damage is nerfed how can that not count ALL weapons??
---
Yes
---
Even if they did fix it, youd just find some other way to be aggrieved by other players and come back to reddit to whine about it.
---
It’s early where I live so I figured maybe there wasn’t enough people to have a full enough game, I did end up restarting fallout and it seemed to fix the issue
---
Yeah this is super annoying
---
You know it was a player when every single door is open.
---
because like I just said in my other post, magic weapons are bugged. they don't really care for the weapon's base damage.
---
so while *you're* getting nerfed, and thus it'll be harder for *you* to deal the required 1k damage on the queen, magic weapons stay the same.
---
that's why you're getting downvoted.
---
As well as super mutant parts at The Emmet's Disposal Site.
---
Not at all. P21 tanked my games stability.
---
Even EQ had some shared bank slots for alts.
---
Not gonna happen.    
---
76 is an MMO at its core and it is designed to be a time sink. Lots of time given up for very little reward.
---
Oh yeah I know I've done the event its insanity if there is enough people
---
&gt; Shrug and go launch a nuke at Earle?
---
To be fair, magic weapons melt Earle as well. Been there done that.
---
So how long does the bounty last? I read it carries over to different servers if you switch, but is it still there when you log back in the next day? A week? Forever until someone kills you?
---
What if you're unstoppable and no one can defeat you because you hold up in your camp, picking everyone off and swap servers when a nuke targets? Giving you time to repair stuff before that server sees your 10,000 cap bounty on the map?
---
You'd be like this mythical unicorn appearing on people's maps, and everyone would just be after this legendary event of trying to kill whatever the sweet hell monstrosity this thing is.
---
I got my base along the west river, so there's about a 45 degree angle of where anything can spawn in (I've been here a while and rarely is this spot taken) as the back of the camp is half into the river and that's also the edge of the map. There's only one direction anything can spawn or attack from, and it's in the nuke free zone too. Any player coming for me is at a disadvantage from the moment they arrive.
---
Can't flank and if they kill me through a window, my loots still inside, and they'd need to pick a lot of locks to get to it. Then they're wanted and I spawn back at my base full health and right next to them from the spawn zone, no longer wanted. 
---
Though the caps are a bummer I suppose.
---
Think you wasting points in luck. 5 - 6 max is enough.
---
Only really need Starched genes, class freak and change bloody mess out with opthers situation / weapon dependent.
---
eg i often switch it out with lucky break when using explosive weapons.etc
---
But that's me. some swear by 12 points in luck.
---
Not according to Bethesda. 
---
[Meat Week will now take place from Thursday, August 20 - 26. Primal Cuts events will start appearing at 11:00 a.m. ET that day so that you can collect some Prime Meat before the first Meat-Cook event at noon.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/72tNixuDqBoHEVDsI3Dc29/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-a-colossal-problem-and-meat-week-begin-soon)
---
Meat Week has two events: Primal Cuts and Meat Cook.
---
Meat Week starts when the first Primal Cuts event starts. It ends when the last Meat Cook event ends. 
---
That’s not semantics. It’s literally what Bethesda said.
---
I found that placing the nuke in the area that you have to fight in the nuke zone helps with these buttheads. 
---
I run a damage heavy bloodied and also have magic weapons but I don’t use them/pull that crap on a public server with 10+ people in a queen fight.
---
They have been incorporating features from ESO, Fallout first is an exact replica of the monthly sub ESO has an optional service: infinite craft bad space, in game currency bonus, exclusive free items. It’s so copied, they even give the exact same number of atoms to crowns.
---
Yeah it sucks. The worst thing is you don't get made aware of the cap until you reach it, or in most peoples cases go over it, forever losing caps, bullion or scrip. Its a joke and Bethesda need to do something about it ASAP, people are screaming for these limits to be removed.
---
Ah okay I see now. Finally someone that wants to explain. Idc bout the downvotes lol. That’s just Reddit.
---
Trade other ppl? Fusion core at 100% is a 1000 rounds on the gathling leaser I’m sure some ppl would trade atleast 500 .45 per fusion cores
---
Some do, and we love you for it.
---
I already have my 3* Furious 90RW shovel, though. That baby digs dirt with FURY.
---
Yes, I agree.  Never will be fixed if not yet.  Sucks, they are never on at my CAMP for visitors unless I happen to be there too.
---
Yup, stim packs and rad away as well
---
I use the powered door wired to pressure plates as an air lock into my biodome house.
---
I see you have the Wild Wasteland Perk.
---
This answer is just as bad as my post
---
Cuz it's cheap and you had nothing else they wanted?
---
I put mine on a pressure plate switch. Occasionally sticks, but fennerally keeps it off until needed.
---
That’s not the Neutron Style, friend.
---
After playing Nuclear Winter up to level 50 I had to see if it was true... sure enough brought me straight to one of the best cheater sites guaranteeing you rank 100 in no time lol You can go full out or just a lil cheat like auto aim ...  That's when I stopped playing NW.
---
Not as fun as Fasnacht. But you can earn alot of xp running all the Prime Cuts events in between the cook out. This time even more than before because of public team bonuses.
---
In that case you're just unlucky. I would have bought your stacks; I even buy .44 ammo now, just for the ammo converter. 
---
I don't know why you would downvote my comment, though: in general, even if I was wrong in your special case, what I wrote is the reason for 3-bullet purchases.
---
I don’t know why people say this either. I think they are just to into the role playing aspect and going for realism.  They also probably sit on the toilet for no reason after their character eats.
---
I dont want to have to open my door every time I go into my camp so I don’t even have them.
---
Well that’s a good tip. And thanks for being good sport!
---
I think it 'helps' because most people just say 'F it' if the nuke is covering drop site V9.
---
fighting the queen is already a chore but in the middle of a nuke? nope.
---
Fastest way too rank up is by starting a new character, head north of vault 76 and make it to the fun fair place.
---
A misc quest for finding jangles the moon monkey will appear and its always in the same place.
---
Pick it up and you'll receive 250XP
---
Kill all the scorched at the fun fair place too finish off the remaining XP. There should be about 10-15 scorched. Easy to kill.
---
I do this all the time and it takes 10 minutes.
---
Bethesda is consistent in finding ways to  implement what we ask for and also what we don’t ask for in the most irritating way possible, and that level of achievement is not possible by accident.
---
The only possibility is a team dedicated to this goal (irritating people but not quite enough so they quit playing) with Bethesda. I have names in mind for this team none of which I can post without receiving some sort of comms ban.
---
Libertrons at 76 would be better for robots.
---
Although depending on your build and what weapons you have access to, you can still 1shot daily ops enemies except for the final boss. I forget if I was using a bloodied or an instigating Gauss rifle, but I was able to down pretty much every robot with a charged torso shot from my Gauss rifle (and gained a hefty amount of 2mm in the process). I’m a heavily optimized bloodied stealth VATS rifleman, so my stealth perks were wasted, and I wasn’t running Adrenaline. I’d switch it up to have that next time. And probably prime my rifle; I’d regain much more than I needed from the contextual ammo looting.
---
Really?  Never seen this.
---
Brace yourself for legendaries being melted in 0.0005 sec.
---
Good stuff. I made a friend like that whom I still play with from time to time. Attacked me at my camp, we went back and fourth on a few pvp sets, ended up trading, talking on ps app chat, ended up teaching me a lot of things I didn’t know!
---
Right! Similarly I keep a supply of bug parts so that Stings and Things can be done quickly. Even if it isn’t “active”, talking to Treadly will trigger it so just show up with all five parts, talk to him, give him the parts, get the XP. Head up to collect red rocket cores to deposit. Get XP. Run to pumpkin house. (I grab the pumpkins before I even talk to the robot).  Get XP. Run to Pricketts Fort and then bury the soldier. Get XP. This run usually takes less than 10 minutes and completes 4 dailies netting between 3000-4000 XP depending on your INT and well rested/food bonus. Add in all the kills along the way and you can easily double that.
---
I might need to do that
---
Beckett literally runs all around my camp area and opens every single door.  He even comes and opens the side door on my garage when the huge garage door is open.  I think he might still be doing chems...
---
for scrip items i go by 10 caps per scrip.
---
scrip heavy 1 star items directly.  don't need that heavy nonsense hogging your stash.
---
just keep the items you yourself would think is useful.
---
in +600 hours i gurantee you NOBODY wants a nocturnal 3\* pool cue.  "spits'
---
BUT keep that to scrip tomorrow since it's light.
---
For a while they were actually using it to make legendary items too :P
---
Oh I see. 
---
Been around since fo4. Used to punish players looting legendary robots or surrounding them in battle. And if there is a horde then the robot will kill u without perks.  Kind of like in call of duty when a player drops grenade on death.  Good mechanic in my opinion(except the disappearing act, which is only bad if it truly disappears and doesn’t get thrown across map). u must tune playstyle accordingly, as with all games with challenges.
---
Done this a few times myself. Every time I exceed 500 script, I buy legendary modules now.  The  Purveyor always disappoints and I've actually crafted a few perfect keepers using the modules.
---
There's so many its all a blur lol
---
Drives me crazy.  
---
I've got a camp with a few buildings and one of them is a hotel. It has 4 doors. If I knew which individuals left them over I would spend the next hour just to nuke them.
---
Going through a silo to have someone else drop her in 30 seconds is also a chore. Yeah. Instead of 30 secs it took 3 mins. You sound really good at this game.
---
I just want something better to grind and the better way to grow, not just unlock skuns endlesly. If ut works in other games, cant see the reasson why nit Fallout. The things are sometimes there but just poorly executed.
---
Equip Green Thumb and do it seconds by harvesting at my camp.
---
Oh I know, I just find Earle actually handles them a little better than the Queen does.  
---
Could well be because the Wendigo and his scream force people to stop firing, thereby buggering the "magic" effect.  
---
I'm also just enjoying the Earle fight more right now; it still has the luster on it that the Queen once did.
---
HOW in the holy mothman is that a problem?
---
Some bugs should NEVER be fixed.
---
Pro tip: Stock up on Nuka mines for AFK players.
---
This game has one of the best communities I’ve ever seen. High level players always giving out plans and gear.
---
The problem with the game was never its community. 
---
Well, except for the immature children who can't accept any criticism of something they like and will angrily fight to the death over their claims that crippling bugs are either.
---
1) intentional.
---
2) not real.
---
But thats largely on here. The in-game community was pretty cool.
---
Nobody said that its good designe just that you need only few min a day to complete this chalange
---
With the latest patch, Punk (my current) no longer opens doors. He phases through them. So now I play hide and seek with him when I return quests. I turn off the quest marker because that would be cheating.
---
Helping a buddy, farming plans, trying to show off? Honestly, I don't bother trying to get into the heads of most other 76'ers. It usually doesn't seem worth it.
---
My Bloodied SS one says otherwise.
---
Give it a shot. You're not really down anything for the time expenditure and some of the new rewards look pretty cool.
---
I guess someone should call the ACOA to go and pick him up and find him a new forever home..
---
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  You need a break.
---
Yeah I don't even have doors in my CAMP anymore. I just pretend that I do lol
---
This is why i sell Halloween candy in my vending machine. Its cheap, light and counts as prewar food and candies, depending on the challenge.
---
It was added quite a while ago.  They didnt really give a reason as to why, just that they made a change to legendary robots and they now explode.  Ive always assumed it was to add flavor because iirc at the time farming the neutral robots in Watoga for legendaries was quite popular.  An added surprise if you will.
---
Yeah I was saving for the sale but I have just spent half it
---
Get the holy hand grenade!
---
Wow. Lotta snitches in this thread.
---
if you know the plans, yes. 
---
Welcome to the legendary troll
---
Could’ve used the motherlode or Lou
---
Between my 2 endurance and 12 endurance, the higher endurance toon does get diseases less from food and environment.  From mobs it doesn't matter,  if it has a disease im going to get it. So, outside of health and any perks you want, it doesn't apparently matter. My higher endurance toon doesnt feel much more durable and outside of cannibal at low level and fire resistant or possibly chem resistant, its a pretty neglected stat. Half the abilities are tied to food and drink, so when they make it optional its going to have even less purpose. I guess iron clad isn't bad if you're going for high endurance anyways.  However, the game seems to be trying to pivot to even out the importance of dps and survivability, so imm not trading out any of my endurance points until the damage reduction and daily ops drop into regular play.
---
I know, I'm just saying it doesn't really do anything other than less people showing up. there's nothing stopping someone with a CSS or a PA to melt her just the same.
---
then again, FPS is apparently tied to magic weapons so maybe you're onto something.
---
a silo should also take you 5 minutes or less, minus prep, if you're clipping through doors. I wouldn't really bother with nukes if I had to go through the entire process each time.
---
No doors gang!
---
Cool. ByzantineFalcon is my IGN. I’ll try to hop on shortly.
---
turn your mouse.
---
I have a rad shower and radiation emitters with a a sign that says please turn off (as the rad emitters break). No one ever does.
---
That's why I just have a big hole in the side of my house.
---
You actually don't. only going to make it tougher for new runners.
---
Have taken a few new players through. easier just you and someone who knows whats up. Then you and your bud can drop his nuke.
---
Agreed
---
With an existing character. West tec, burrows, golf club, capital building repeat. Be on a team with inspirational equipped, well rested bonus and cranberry relish with herbivore.
---
They need the Salt from console players to season all the meat.
---
Ya i play on Pc. Join the different discords and ask in their trade chat for cheap serums. Someone messaged me and made them free. But since then I've bought a couple more for 400ish each.
---
The stings and things is good to know, I'll have to add that one to my list. 
---
I also do BIV's quest daily as well. Talk to him, go shoot a ghoul outside and talk to him again. Usually only a couple of minutes with good rewards. People snap up the alcohol plans quick. Plus there's at least three Med-X and whatever's in the mirror in the main room
---
Oh, that makes sense why brotherhood reward is called "A second helping"
---
The stealth suit ish viable for an end game sniper. The agility you gain from unyielding armor provides more stealth
---
It's a crutch no matter what, so if you need it in pve, you're bad at the game as well.
---
I thought it was another tool from the same developer, but yeah, that were quite fun times :D
---
No offence intended buddy, I’m in total agreement with your points :)
---
Settler Wandered makes it her duty to go around my house and open all the doors.  Then she goes out and opens my garden's gate.
---
It has to be done, and by Joves she'll see it done!
---
It just doesn't place it in that world. You don't have to physically replace your camp
---
"Oh, Leslie. Back so soon? Pity."
---
We get it but the hot fix for critter spawns isn’t scheduled until the events over
---
Yeah my wife’s bf hates it when I spend like an hour doing this shit when he and my wife want to watch The Witcher. Thanks man!
---
Go take a workshop. Once done you get the small water purifier plan i believe. Those can be placed on dirt. So no matter where you build your camp you can place them. Then build like 20 lol. Go do stuff in game, come back every 15 or 20 mins and collect water. Then make a trip to trainstations to sell at vendor.
---
Oh wow I see now it says 2 hrs until daily reset. 
---
Imma turd.
---
Just click on the blue icon of the place you want to go... just know that it costs caps depending on how far away you want to jump.
---
Players claiming glitches when there are no glitches..... Going to be a long weekend.
---
I really like this idea. I think I'll try making a vendor like that too.
---
Mine was never deleted in the past. I've play since Beta.. once I went to a different world after hitting ok my camp was where it was supposed to be
---
built in damage reduction in PA
---
he also turns off radios i think.  he's constantly complaining about them
---
by playing the game and crafting ammo.
---
I think it is in walls
---
note, link just takes me to the 'signout' page with infinite load (on any browser)
---
Signs catch it if you place one under it
---
Its viable now but after one apalachia it wont so dot waste perk points on that
---
Yes although it's not really needed for an auto grenade launcher, it really shines on full auto heavies.
---
 Yes although again it's not really needed and may actually make you quite mad.  Explosives can cripple anyway so all it will really do is increase the likelyhood you will cripple yourself if it goes off too close to you.
---
And yes.
---
Ya i would love that also. Maybe like world of warcrafts system. While not as many choices, it lets you save 3 builds then swap between them for different activities.
---
so many decisions reek of 'malicious compliance'
---
What system are you on? I usually stock a few 2* unyeilding pieces.
---
Yeah I love the Biv quests because at this point it’s just “drink x and do a thing”. I pair this with Heart of the Enemy because the door to get to the lab with the centrifuge at VTU is literally right across from Biv’s back door.
---
Bruh. Thats just sad that they are that sensitive. I guess they just can't handle the truth.
---
I believe you lol. Im at about 140 hrs and still have alot to do and learn.
---
Just use a stealth suit.
---
My 2shot explosive FFR shovel says otherwise
---
I think some of it is just available resources, like team size and time.
---
For example: I'm digging the Cursed weapons right now. I wish there was more than the just the three of them (and a heavy gun that wasn't the antithesis of my playstyle) but I'm digging them all the same.
---
They've been there since the first iteration of the Earle, so they were designed as part of the event from jump, which is a good sign.
---
Hopefully in the long run, we'll see more stuff like that and it'll trend upward.
---
It's just going to take time as even content patches like these take months, plus they have the major patches like Wastelanders and evidently Fractured Steel, which are likely pulling most of what they've got available.
---
This isn't meant as an excuse or anything, simply a statement of available facts.
---
I'd love another PA set like the Strangler Heart, and other things similarly worth striving for. Vault 94 was my focus in this game for months, and even in its Daily Ops form, it's really just 94-lite to me.
---
I'm still hoping they'll release proper Vault Raids again, with suitable gear to go along with it, but all I can say really is "Wait and see."
---
Hey you know my girlfriend!!!
---
I understand what your saying and in my experience if I leave V9 or FSD open to fight and someone drops her in 30 sec my next one will go over everything and it won’t happen in that one. 
---
Yes it only takes 5 min to run though a silo but that 5 mins turns into a chore if someone else drops her in 30sec.
---
Will it spoil?
---
Probably two weeks or so. PC has to suffer so we can have fun.  
---
Just dont quote me. I haven't read or seen any post giving a time frame.
---
Ok this feature always works for me tho. Like 95% of the time, everytime.
---
Get off my lawn
---
I'm kinda mad that we can get a harpoon gun in the mining hills of West Virginia, but not a huge drill.
---
Missed opportunity.
---
To give a likely explanation the "buying a bunch" part, when there are several thousand ammo for sale and one buys them most or all of them at once, the owner is very likely to log out immediately (max caps). That means one has to find another vendor to buy 2 more things for the challenge.
---
Useless post lol
---
Somewhere between the twentieth and fortieth time this question gets asked on reddit , expect an overlap of at least ten “ are the servers up yet “ with replies varying from “ ask your mom “ to “ yes “
---
but I love my junkie's + 1 S shovel
---
That would require good writing and effort. To things the 76 team cannot do, or at the very least won't do.
---
Ok, that would make sense, but, Bethesda claimed later this week, which does not seem likely anymore
---
Which face? 😂
---
We didn’t need any help in the end. I’m level 140 bloodied shotgun build so was able to one shot everything, just figured we’d see if anyone wanted to get involved
---
This is true, but when audio has cut out for me, the subs usually still function? Man I wish I had a better solution for ya :)
---
I like it , I’ll give it 4 out of 5 randoms chasing you down just to give the thumbs up emote
---
You’d be surprised how little it takes to get banned from this sub as well.
---
*blank stare*
---
Funny though, how that watch is responsible for Marcellus Wallace going all medieval on a bunch of rednecks.
---
Plus it's only the dailies
---
Hell, its probably just up in the air at this point. Might be one of those cases where, "You'll get it if we fix it" scenarios.
---
if you can join a team that has a camp near the wayward is even fster. 
---
also you dont need to pick up anything inside the vault. it all gets magically added to your inventory when you leave the vault. so run like hell to the exit. 
---
and the first two responders quests are really fast to complete. so save that char. level 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 takes 3-4 minutes
---
I usually delete this char at level 5 after completing ‘second helpings’
---
It should find a server where your CAMP can be placed not 99% put you in and then repeatedly get that message. Considering how advanced we are with programming, computers, etc., this isn't some reality-bending concept.
---
Yeah something like "We had reports of a horde of supplies down in the monongah mine, we sent several teams down and none have reported back. We checked seismic data of the area and suspect another scorchbeast to be nesting down here, we need to destroy it before it becomes a threat." So you drop a nuke on it and then the quest could instruct to "Check the mine to ensure the scorched have been destroyed" and thats when you find Earle.
---
Get a life maybe and you won't care so much about idiotic garbage.
---
Green thumb doesn't actually affect the challenge tho, only the amount you receive.
---
added
---
Yup, but they never acctually fix it, they just try and cover the holes with duct tape and hope that the tape is strong enough
---
Final Gutsy is always a legendary!  Just wish the event happened more frrquently
---
Yes! I even put my benches outside in their own area with my vendors and everything, even a spare bed for people to get a quick XP boost while on the road, and then people come over to my "player home" if you will, rummage through my living room and leave my damn door open. Were you born in a barn?
---
They said later this week on Tuesday. Most are hoping for today idk we will see
---
My solution would be only have certain enemies with the "Piercing Gaze" mutation. Give them a "Sentinel" or "Observer" label. This could add more depth to Daily Ops where the stealth player(s) will have to try to take them out as quickly as possible before their cover is blown or coordinate with their non-stealth teammates to take them out for them. 
---
Anything is better than just giving every single one of them that mutation. Making an entire playstyle absolutely useless in Daily Ops is a horrible design decision.
---
Yeah this needs to happen. This is the sole reason I refuse to buy any Jetpack skins. I do not want to craft a whole new jetpack just to change the look.
---
If I remember right, one of the soldiers during 'Duty calls' (Radcliff?) comments how RobCo deliberately rigged their robots so some of them would blow up randomly when destroyed. One could argue that General Atomics did the same or maybe it was a Vaulttec/Government decision.
---
Does not make it less annoying, but seems to be intentional.
---
If someone came into my house and insulted me I would throw them out too...
---
Usually never is 😔
---
The mods of this forum just removed my post. I give up
---
It is more likely that we get a star field trailer than a small event not getting delayed 2 1/2 months.
---
If you have it in a hallway you need to go through to get to your shops that's understandable. I'm a Bloodied PA build and while radiation scares me as much as the next guy, I need my rads.
---
The only thing better than mole rats is when their collectron didnt de spawn when they left the world and thats what's preventing your house.
---
Damn I am kinda jealous not gonna lie!  I want one!
---
it actually does work but have you considered your camp location is super fucking common
---
Welcome back , everything you own has been duped and shit that was worthless can now be traded for anything you want in the entire game. In our new world the man in the red dress is king!
---
And don’t even try to reason with them about how ridiculous that was. It’s like talking to children.
---
Agreed, But they use only the best of the best tape if there is a bug giving free atoms or score.
---
Oops.
---
Shes rocking an auto grenade launcher and needs the springs to craft more 40mm ammo.
---
I don't see much reason to farm Earlie beyond getting the rewards once. Yes, you can get 8 treasury notes, but you can participate in 4 public events that are much easier and much more reliable. Also I need violet/crimson flux for ultracite ammo for my weapons which aren't exactly available in the mine-nuke region.
---
I used to go in with Power Armor thinking it was the best way until I got a set of Troubleshooter armor. It was a game changer for me and this event.
---
I was playing the other day and I shouted that people kept opening all my doors and leaving them open. My SO was so confused as why I was upset. I was confused that he wasn't! We may be in the wasteland but you don't have to be heathens about it. Every time somebody leaves my door open, a yao guai comes inside and starts wrecking my stuff.
---
[STOP IT](https://youtu.be/9Deg7VrpHbM)
---
Bubba got the Surf, Grahm got the Turf!!
---
Oh, okay. Thank you. I will do that.
---
That definitely explains why that shotgun seems to be much better than the quadruple one, that I wanted so badly and I am now so upset about. ;) It also breaks once per hour.
---
Well done, sir!
---
If you opt to not place your camp it DOES place next time. You can enjoy the world your camp doesn't place at and then leave and come back to a world your camp can exist at and it will be there! Don't hesitate to visit someone cause your camp cant.
---
Well it's like a capture point mission, take point and defend until you take control of that point, stand within the vicinity so you'd capture it faster.
---
If they allow stealth then well you can just stand and wait, what's the fun.
---
Most players think "now that I have access, that door doesn't exist anymore" and go about their business. And because they usually FT to leave the camp, they won't ever notice the door again.
---
Is that a original Bill Crosby sweater you are wearing?
---
I had someone throw a bunch of grenades at me, come close, do a heart emote and then drop a bunch of screws and flux in his death loot bag
---
Later this week, assuming all goes well on pc is how they framed it
---
I've never done this before.    
---
Is it best for a high level or low-level characters? Would it benefit swapping out alts?
---
ah good.
---
1) The mutants is "so-so." Probably scrip.
---
2) Anti-armor can be effective, but it is only 1 star.
---
3) Furious what?
---
4) Suppressors - yeah, most people don't believe it works that well if at all.
---
I currently have a Vampires +LD + Faster Reload &amp; it's god-tier. I'd say save up Legendary Modules and keep trying.
---
It just works!
---
Grass would be a nice game addition. Both kinds.
---
Yes and Yes.  Add this to the laundry list of QoL features/UI updates that this game desperately needs.
---
We had that yesterday when suddendly he was all over the place glitching into the ceiling and ground for no reason. He even tryed to climb up the shaft you jump down when the event starts.
---
They might as well just give it to us since they likely won’t be able to fix a damn thing anyways.
---
I play stealth rifleman currently. In the new event you lose stealth and dont get the bonus attack . I have all the stealth perks and stealth suit on. Normal fights that are non new event are fine though. If you have fixer it might perform better but I dont have that yet.
---
I think the pipe is life.......
---
Alright, thanks a lot! Do you have the bigger ones aswell? Is there a limit in placing the small ones?
---
Are you playing on PC? There is a mod that already gives you totals of each category in your personal inventory, but I don't think it works in your stash. Its definitely something Bethesda should implement for QoL for everyone.
---
Once I found a loot bag next to the grave with the shovel in it and I started to do the same. Just pick and drop the damn shovel for the next dweller. It will be there while you’re still in that world.
---
Switch doors, that was my fix.  I have a split level Camp, living space and basement, and the basement has door access to my water farm pier.  That door has a switch inside and out so it will auto open/close
---
just furious, damage is increased after each consecutive hit on same target.
---
Excuse me what is LD? still not good with legendary abbreviations :p And thank you for reply!
---
Feels unsustainable, yes, but I’m proof you can take a Level 250+ to at least Rank 93 hitting that daily level up. For me, it has meant spending a lot of time in Cranberry. Every nuke dropped on Fissure Prime has been a treasured XP gift.
---
You'll probably want to keep rolling until you get a AA FFR or V FFR with your build.  I would stick with your 1 star AA for the time being, good hunting 👍
---
The damage NERF is actually going to make the gap bigger because "magic" weapons dont rely at all on damage perks or the weapons actual damage.  It's a glitch in the coding.  Meanwhile all legit damage across the board is going to be lower for every spec.  So now the new meta changes from bloodied and junkies to literally everyone running "magic" weapons.  Doesnt that sound like fun?  🤣
---
Really hoping Beth rethinks some of this.
---
Man the Bethesda forums are the most misinformed bunch of morons in the community. Reading them and the shit they let fly vs what they don’t makes me hate the company a little. To be fair I doubt the dev team looks at them but It’s like watching a neighbourhood watch meeting in a retirement community. And I’m not young.
---
it's t51 not t45 but good try
---
I picked a bad week to go vegan in this game...
---
Magazines are for reading
---
Imagine crying like a little bitch boy over internet points. Grow the fuck up
---
It's still a bonus. Sell or make you have more of something for less work.
---
I guess I’ll try to find someone who sells them in discord.
---
Well that same drill....if you played the heist then you know what happened to it
---
Oh okay, thank you! :)
---
I'm reminded of Grifball from Halo
---
Yes. You don't eally spec for magic damage. It happens based off the weapon and 1 armor piece.
---
They probably think you shut them off to ppl because your max caps
---
No harm no foul lol
---
Oooh I get it now. 
---
Thanks for explaining to me! 🙏🏼
---
Yup that sounds like the most fun ever.. 🤣
---
Well my post should have been about that then. I hope they either Remove these weapons or nerf the hell out of them.
---
If it disappears give it a few minutes and it turns into a scrap pile where it died
---
Yeah, I think they could be a bit more creative with it. I love your idea. Or even a temporary aid item or grenades that could disorient them and give you a chance to find some cover could be good. I think we’ll see adjustments to this, it’s been pretty consistent feedback on the PTS forum that just wiping out the build isn’t a great plan.
---
Nope it's a misc item and can't spoil.
---
I love drunk shopping in this game. I once woke up after a drunken night of playing to discover i had almost zero caps but 60 copies of the 'you have been insulted' note in my inventory. It must have made sense to me at the time
---
Welll bois and gals time to grind
---
It’s somewhat of a niche item or an impulse buy, people show up to look through my legendary weapons and armor and pick up 300-1000 rounds  of ammo  while they are there, stock up on legendaries to increase foot traffic, because not everyone uses Gatling lasers and power armor so you want as many people perusing your wares as possible.
---
Awesome
---
You CAN jump up or jetpack up there. You can also access it via the roof, there's a level 3 lock you can pick to get through a hatch next to a trailer/office on the roof
---
I’ve only heard him complain about Rose while camped in the Divide.
---
One of each type, so you can change based on needs at the moment, plus some extras. Good luck!
---
I allways have my door open. But I understand its manners that if the door was closed then close it after you leave
---
dying\*
---
Don’t install doors, you won’t be disappointed
---
if the door is closed when I arrive Ill close it..
---
I always leave it as I found it
---
I'm a bloodied commando/unarmed, and I have a magic minigun that works, 2 magic UGLs that work, and I've tried various magic shotguns that have also worked for me. And I'm obviously not spec'd into any of the above, but the magic still happens.
---
Meat week makes me want to go to a Brazilian steak house.
---
Mmmmm flank steak on a spit
---
I totally get it. I buy those notes too when they're not 30,000 caps.
---
Obligatory: "Pics or it didn't happen"
---
reloading takes longer than killing  :-)
---
You can hook some up to the pressure plate.
---
Here's what I want to know... I have a "noob friendly" camp near vault 76.  I have low level guns with good mods and matching ammo in my vendor (10mm pistol, sniper rifle, pump shotty) for free, with the idea being to help out some newbies.  Yet more often than not, it's a level 200+ at my camp taking all the free shit.  Why???  That's just rude, man.
---
If I'm being completely honest, I doubt I'd be able to wear either without calibrated shocks. Even switching to Excavator I have to switch on traveling pharmacy or I am over encumbered. So I'll probably start on t-65 at least until I can hunt that down for ultracite.
---
Same. I've heard the allies can drop you that but have never seen proof. Or it talked about much haha
---
I couldn't agree more. 'Cheating' in strictly single player games is fine - the only person it affects is you. It may not be how the game is meant to be played, but whatever you find fun is fine (particularly on a subsequent play through).
---
In any type of multiplayer game it's completely different though. Even if you're not pitted directly against other players, your actions have consequences on them, so it's completely different.
---
I do worry a little when I see posts like this though, since depending on the implementation, the finer points may be missed. I seem to recall reading a while back that at one point someone tried to ban any account that was installed in the same machine that had Cheat Engine installed ('installed' specifically, not 'running'). This is a terrible way to do it.
---
Those junk junkies are crazy
---
ooooh, maybe that's what he's complaining about! I only ever catch something about "off the damn radio". that he's complaining about rose makes way more sense then general radios.
---
It's a one in a million kind of thing.  I know of 2 other ppl who have got them from purveyor or thier own rolls .
---
Yeah the ultracite mods are a bitch
---
Gorilla is about 1k standard, I give them away. You’ll be lucky to sell the ice lights to anyone but a newbie.
---
Hmm, Im not sure I have the means to jetpack up there! Im only level 25. So the only ''normal'' way is through the door on the roof which has a level 3 lock?
---
Stabilized is great, but one gun army makes the queen to reset her flight animation preventing her from landing.  Anything with stagger affect makes her reset actually.
---
TE GS? https://imgur.com/gallery/Mopr8pl
---
Why would someone want to pick those locks?
---
All of them have the exploding effect. Equip demolition expert and you’ll see a healthy bump in damage.
---
A player was wanted and arrived to do the Line in the Sand event with me. I thumb-up him and we then proceed to burn some scorched. We went on separate ways after the loot. 
---
You not wanted for me bro. I don’t care for PVP (not in this game at leasts).
---
Can't remember the Q&amp;A video thing, still the 10th is not mid September. Nobody knows exactly, so doing "research" on a theory like this is unimportant to me.
---
If it weren't for the title, this post started out like it was going in a whole different direction! I never get tired of stories like these! Even when people are jerks out in the world, it's nice to find decency and generosity in Appalachia, at least!
---
they should just do away with leveling up and getting gear altogether..
---
you should be able to pick all the stuff you want before you leave the vault
---
If you want less people going into your house or around your scavenger bot and whatnot, make a shed or garage thing and put all your workbenches out there. But more valuable stuff inside the house and lock all the doors. Idk stops npcs and players from going in sort of
---
That's what I thought but I've never seen bullets explode as a a legendary effect on the weapon like this one. Added a picture
---
Correct
---
Rad shower was the only place I put a switch on, because some people run rad builds.
---
ty again.I tried to put low prices for most of the things,and random ones for things I didn't know their value
---
It's not always legendaries, either! Sometimes, you are lucky enough to hear them spinning up after death, so you have JUST enough time to spam loot and run.
---
While I have never grinded queen, I have been playing for a long time and was suprised by how many Ultracite mods I did have.
---
Problem is, I couldnt even find the door on the roof! I did find that trailer/office on the roof you mentioned, it had a level 2 lock. So the other door is somewhere near that trailer?
---
He disappears right away sometimes. Everything purple is the clue. I have even seen Beckett Purple!
---
Redeeming 250 scrip when you're nearly at limit and know it makes no sense either.
---
I would even add that if one day Bethesda decides to implimente an even ( an alarm ) to tell us that:《 A player's workshop is being contested...do you want to give support ? 》,or something like that,I would definitely join it ! The problem with the current system is yes...we are losing stuff in there when a toxic pvp erreur wanna play with us ! But if i can pvp for near no cost, i'd join !
---
If Bethesda really want to know if the community really likes having PvP in public workshops, they should let us talk ! They sould let us give help to the workshops onwers, if needed ! 
---
I'd definitely give it a try !
---
Maybe it’s a change in the description with the update. Bethesda has been known to be tricky like that. Or it’s an exploding explosive which makes just as much sense as the Brotherhood coming all the way from Broken Hills less than 40 years after the war.
---
They did not design a whole new system that logs you out of the current world and finds a new one for you. All that popup does is log you out and immediately log you back in "saving" you a few days button pushes. If the world you just left hasn't filled up since the second ago you left it or a space in an older world hasn't opened up you're going straight back to where you came from.
---
Never pick the option to let the game do it, its too fast. Just log out yourself, wait a few seconds and log back in.
---
Maybe that was it. I was sure it was level 3, but I could be mistaken.
---
Coming in a later patch, they have datamined glass wall and roofs.
---
I would say September 8th could be considered “mid September”. “Mid September” is not a specific date. 
---
I’m not asking for research. I’m asking where they allegedly said 76 days. This is he first I’m hearing of this.
---
I agree, while we may not be getting the atoms we are still getting free cosmetic items from the game board.. i mean most are not good but i like a couple things on there and the bos thing is giving us some cool things. Its not like they abandoned the game.
---
This is why I don't put doors in my camp. The community doesn't deserve nice things. Or doors.
---
With that situation 3+ max levels and a bloodied build with a fixer or handmade it’s not even a bother. Can run whitesprings and kill everything before it knows your there. It’s meta buikd for a reason
---
it's not a raid, 2cent refunded
---
No downvotes from me... not sure why you'd be downvoted? I will upvote you to try and offset it though :-)
---
It's a wasted star unfortunately, they explode anyway, but it is rare
---
at what time does meat week start?
---
Sadly the workaround put in place seems to be FO1st. Only benefit I've seen is an additional Encrypted event without server hopping.
---
This has happened to me as well, but it was Glowing Radstags about five of them. lol
---
But the thing is, I unlocked the door of that trailer and went inside, but that wasnt the upper section inside the plant Im talking about. It was just a trailer of its own. There were no Nuka Cola Quantum in there and you can see from the screenshots that there are some Nuka Cola Quantum there. You also cant see the inside of the plant or the yellow forklift from the trailer. Im completely baffled how to access this particular section lol
---
Weasel is good at making big boom too. She's cleared rocks out of our path. And honestly, any reason to hang out with her more is good.
---
Exactly... People spending more than 3 caps on that daily are mental
---
soon
---
there's a glass wall/roof set as one of the SCORE season 2 rewards.
---
People are completing this event cause there is a lot of people with either magic heavies or outright hacked weapons. Without them, the enormous lag in the cave is making the bulletspongines kinda unbearable.
---
Scorchbeast in the air is gone in 2 seconds. It’s stupidity overpowered
---
regarding all other plans,is 99 caps fine?
---
It’s a metal hatch on the roof on the left side as you walk away from that room.
---
Unless you find something really nice haha. But 99% of the time I just hit the ammo first thing to get it done
---
I'm fine with folks leaving my door and my gate open. I wish they'd stop killing my fucking Brahmin. Last night, an asshole walked in as I walking out and I hear gunshots and see my Brahmin flying over the wall. Why though? I leave everything unlocked. I'm not an asshole.
---
Unless there’s a change. Today at 11 eastern time you can start collecting prime cuts. Grahm’s first cooking event starts at 12
---
Either, it's a very easy event
---
Prime Cuts (side events where you can get cuts of meat to donate for scrip) starts at 10 eastern. Then Meat Week (the actual event, the cookout) kicks off at 11 eastern.
---
The trick is to never move it, and have it really fuckin high up in the mountains, near the Crosshair
---
\+50% Limb Damage
---
It's a buggy effect where you can get massive stacking of damage.
---
I'm ok with them not carrying over, I don't like the coin/card scrap nonsense....nobody does
---
i'm level 181, i used to swear by having my rifleman and shotgun perks maxed out. but as time went on and started seeing what other players are using to maximize their damage output i started to play around a bit with the perk cards. when i am just wondering around i usually use my Super Mutant Fixer or Medics Explosive Handmade
---
now depend on the event i swap between shotgun and heavy guns. i also equipped bloody mess and glow sight. all depends on the events i am doing mainly. i will use bloody mess for everything now (i had my doubts but now i am thankful i have it). glow sight i use when doing radiation rumble, uranium fever and whenever whitesprings gets nuked. now i'm just waiting to test it out on the Colassal Problem event.
---
ACP does not go live today. Not sure where you heard that, but nothing has been announced yet.
---
It’s only really significant for sheepsquach and sbq for the dps. I ran lever action sneak sniper for the first 150 levels and 1 shot everything bar the big stuff I just mentioned. Tried low health for the nerd rage and adrenal buffs and the Uny armour stat buffs and never looked back
---
I kept mine after realising this
---
The Magic still happens, just less magic,  if you spec into it/ use buffs/ nerd rage/use a bloodied magic weapon it makes it even crazier.
---
Maggie gets her fathers pocket watch, I get Maggie's father as my new floor decor. It's a win win.
---
Only the case for some weapons in vats,  not heavies like the mini.  He just needs a magical effect and possibly an accelerated barrel depending on the Minigun.
---
Ohh, no you're looking for black/dark grey HATCH. Like a cellar-type hatch.
---
This happened to me too. I was in a public team with another member who completed the quest and launched the nuke, and it completed for me too.
---
They said later this week, there's still more this week left. Bitch about it when it's next week.
---
If someone in your team drops a nuke and you have not completed the quest it will auto finish.  Bethesda also does not reset quest progress.  Sorry.
---
If you're on a team with someone and they launch a nuke, you will receive credit for the quest. You should have also received the trophy for it.
---
Now turn the picture in to the authorities. He's obviously a communist.
---
Thanks, that's interesting. Do the bullets change as it happens with other Energy weapons? Also I'd compare it with another Gauss Shotgun to see if it's actually stronger.
---
Even if it isn't, there's no doubt that Collectors on the trading sub could give you a lot for that.
---
Yes! I know it's the apocalypse - but were you raised in a barn?
---
I thought it was delayed from Tuesday to today? Well I'll be doggone!
---
Mod support for console when? 
---
Jk but yeah a great QoL feature
---
Stand Still Laddie!
---
Lest the fat and psychopathic ghouls thrash you within inches of your life....
---
No, you're thinking of Meat Week
---
Problem solved.  It was the cycling light.
---
At first I thought it was cool to lock the most "advanced" mod plans behind scorchbeast fights, but then I looked at the odds and was frustrated.
---
Sucks I can't trade it tho. My Bloodied is doing 1000 more damage. But I'm still gonna test it out and see how it fares
---
Leveled an alt to 50....read perk leveling not shared = back to mule role
---
Yeah less than 1% is super gross. I bought all my mods have had 1 emergency protocols drop for me in the hundreds of Queen fights I've done
---
if you knew, what did your post add then? It would not resolve workshop disputes regardless.
---
BLOAT FLIES!!!!!!!
---
I did that once, and only once. I played for a few hours.  When I went to a different world where my camp could be placed, all items had been unassigned from my vending machines and display shelves.   So I had inadvertently scrapped all my robot models for screws.  ☹
---
I don’t see the problem with a decimal. Just make the ammo point value a float variable and you’re good.
---
Right, how could I forget that. Bullion stuff isn't tradeable.
---
It's most likely because I haven't actually used any Wastelander gear outside of the Stealth Suit lol
---
Amen.
---
Usually between 1130 and 12 us east time. Sometimes later
---
To be fair, they said they plan to release the hotfix later in the week and I would’ve suspected Thursday.
---
Pipe is LIFE!
---
I would prefer it be restricted to those with maxed out reputation to give more value to completing those grinds.
---
Never met him... Here, have some tea ;-)
---
No need to close the red rocket garage door when it does it itself
---
Not to mention there is an active drill in the mine that will kill you if you get to close.
---
They should really just add a search function to find only servers where your camp is available. This technology isn’t hard to implement and has existed for decades. 
---
The only problem (and I believe this is what Bethesda has said before) is that search times would dramatically increase, to which I say joining the same server over and over again is NOT faster
---
Right, but that was just a guess.
---
Damn I hope so. I have a tenderiser in the stash of both my characters, taking up what 20masses. I keep it because I don't know if I would get it again, now I can just craft one if feel like using it.
---
Well dont I look like a fool. Lol. Thanks for the info though.
---
Was brought up several times on the PTS forums. They must not have liked it
---
FYI you can still do the quest. Once you have your keycard just go down to a silo. You will then get steps on what you need to do to launch a nuke.
---
But I can only play 2 minutes every week!
---
That attitude of most companies providing micro transactions is 'the less they give you for free, the more you'll buy'.
---
I couldn't say how often that was true, but certainly from my perspective, I consider microtransations as voluntary donations. The happier I am with the product or company, the more I buy. Unfortunately this means the my purchases tend to go down when companies get more greedy or manipulative.
---
I bet the overseer wouldn't mind remodeling her place.
---
Thanks for the info. I dont pay attention to much news around the game.
---
Youre right, I found it. I didnt even notice it! But yeah, the lock is indeed level 3, so I  guess Ill just have to wait. Thanks for the answer
---
I will literally close doors at camps I haven't even gone inside. I feel this.
---
Leather coat is a 0.02% drop from Mire and Free States dailies and events. You either need to grind your ass off in the Mire for a month plus (how I got the Traveling Leather Coat) or visit the trade sub and find someone luckier willing to trade (how I got the regular Leather Coat).
---
Found it, thanks!
---
4-5 from a quest line.  
---
1 from scorched earth
---
1 from an atom shop bundle
---
the remainder were from xmas presents.
---
some people have them in vendors.
---
I use mine to smack fireflies to piss the Mothman off 😂😂
---
I thought I saw it some where. This is from the forum: 
---
"We're wrapping up maintenance now, and preparing to bring Fallout 76 back online for PC. Thanks for your patience during downtime, and again we are planning to release this update for console players as soon as possible in the coming days. 
---
If you haven't already, you can check out the notes for today's hotfix here on Fallout.com. 
---
Thanks!"
---
I figured this meant Thursday (today).
---
Thanks for explaining!
---
I would love the idea, but similar to climbing ladders, I just don't think the creation engine is built for it. They just released a bunker after all, and it's still above ground. There are some places where you can build without necessarily glitching, you just have to place foundations carefully.
---
Lore is fluid after the timelines been split.
---
Easiest thing for me....Exit is to the right of the big drill in the wall...
---
You would think it would be BOS instead of communist.  Bring the initiate paint job back that’s no longer available.
---
No problem - just to give you an example. I can use my Gauss Mini on the Encryptid (Imitation Sheepsquatch) and kill her in less than 30 seconds.
---
I think most everyone did as well.
---
I have a number of them.  PSN Aj ninetyeight, in game aj-98.
---
Or just have the BOS bunker have a stairs down option like walls have doors and windows
---
I only keep three endurance for fireproof, but I may take the legendary perk for it, just so I can get a couple quality of life perks. I was thinking the nuka cola one so I can chug a quantum to fuel up the Dodgy perk with 10 more uses and run around being nearly invulnerable for like 30 seconds.
---
Originally I heard they were going to be account wide, now they are going to be character specific? That's stupid.
---
The Whitesprings Service door is haunted... Maybe, just maybe the same ghost is at your camp.
---
There are more of those. At least one that you can use at chinese base for travelling.
---
I want auto-closing doors!!!
---
its a public event, you shouldnt lose anything when you die, even if you get burried in there, you respawn at the entrance with your junk on you and right after that the event finishes and you get your rewards
---
That is literally the only reason I keep my main house area door locked. Well, that and the fact that if I'm in bed and AFK, I'm less likely to die in my sleep thanks to some random spawn attack since I decided to move camp to the bog area. Poor Beckett keeps questioning my home spot choices.
---
So you do need the armour piece as well? I was reading up on it but it was mostly discussions like this one and it seemed as if it was one or the other, but you’re confirming you need to armour as well?
---
Might not be able to make those checks until after you're already in the server.
---
Technology might be more advanced but that doesn't mean that the game is utilizing that technology.
---
you can check how it looks here https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa
---
They're already planning on making underground camps. That's what the "CAMP Shelters" flagged for the winter update refers to.  
---
It's how they plan on expanding a bunch of camp budget issues, by giving us all an instanced fallout shelter to build in.  
---
The specifics of it, however, have yet to be made clear.
---
Right, but unless they provide an actual date, it's just a guess. Wednesday or Friday were just as likely.
---
I don't want them to bring it back only because i have it and it's a legacy...but if i didn't have it i would want them to bring it back too..xD
---
I have a camp with like thirty doors. It's a maze you have to get through to get to the vending machines. Every time somebody buys something I am like "better go home and close all ghe doors"
---
The cook off is easy and can be done at any level 
---
The primal cuts are about killing creatures and you can go to several places on the map to choose what level you want to do
---
A more interesting story would have been to make Earle invincible. Meaning we would eventually defeat and subdue him where he would just pass out long enough for us to then collect his treasure/loot. The timer then becomes his wake up time during which time we loot as much possible before escaping. Once he awakens he'll trap us and kill us all with his mighty scream of revenge.  A mighty scream where he shouts "Maggie!!!!!" in a big monster voice.
---
It's the legendary telling you where he **was**, in case you couldn't find him.
---
/s
---
Allies, there's a set one in creater and foundation. As well as 2 with story lines. And a rare one you can find wandering around. Google fallout76 allies for more info
---
She was probably one of if not my favorite characters from Wastelanders.

I don't understand why they gave us Dynomite? I haven't seen anyone use it? It would have made since we have to use it to clear Boulders.
---
1... 2... 5!
---
I’m surprised they aren’t already a thing. Would be a great addition. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if they appear some where down the line as Bethesda have been releasing quite a few prefabs over the last few months.
---
Nice thanks for the info! I luckily have one of those magic LMGs. Definitely after that reclaimed gas masks whenever it comes out in console
---
well assaultron's weak spot is limbs so if you have LD effect it's even more powerful, I see. Nice, I'll look for it then :p
---
can it also use the diffuser one? and what's priority of use if you carry multiple types of stimpak?
---
Yeah, it's brutal, especially considering I normally level once a *week*. I've had to lean into some unhealthy habits to try and keep pace for three levels a week, let alone seven. 
---
It's absolutely killing me and I hope they pull back on this in the future. It's utterly unsustainable.
---
Idk.  I want the event too but I’ve heard multiple reports it causes the whole server to lag when everyone’s fighting Earle,  even people way across the map.  It stops when Earle Dies.  Between fast travel bugs and server disconnects I’d rather not add more crippling lag to the mix.  I can wait.
---
Those are allies.  There are currently 5 of them.  You can randomly meet them in the wild but both factions have one in their camps and 2 are quests that should be already on your map.  The faction ones are the easiest to get.  The raider punk is located in the tunnels beneath Crater and the settler forager can be found below foundation wandering around on the bridges in the cavern portion.  You just talk to them and through a few dialogue choices you ask them to "move in".  They then give you a camp item to put down in your camp that summons them.  Currently you can collect all 5 and they aren't customizable in appearance with clothes/armor but you can only have one active at a time.  Hope that helps.
---
Actually, the Encryptid doesn't have a weak spot...it's just pure damage sponge.
---
I get that.  I have all the others and have had people tell me they’ll paint it for me for free I just need to get stash space to build the T-60 to have it painted the initiate. But I would rather know the plan. But nope. Got on game too late.
---
I landed an Instigating on my 5th roll. It's not popular but I've always been partial to that effect, and I was thrilled to get it on the Gauss Shotgun. It did not disappoint.
---
Close my fucking *fireplace.*
---
Gating it behind Rep seems counter-intuitive to the point of having it exist at all.
---
Oh I thought it was the same any other assaultron, just more powerful xD okay, thanks.
---
You gotta be super sexy to get people to hang out in your camp
---
Very nice casual PC crew here. Feel free to join and hit us up in game.

Hey, I don't know if you're still looking for friends but I'm available! Ign is same and I think I'll be able to play around 4pm PST, I'm est tho

I lived in the Philippines,at Clark AFB,back in the mid 80s. We were there 3.5 years,my dad was active duty back then. I couldn't believe the amount of spiders,giant flying cockroaches,snakes,there were.There was a playground connecting the high school I went to and the middle school. It would regularly get shut down,because of cobras being seen there. One day I was walking across our yard,about to walk under our tree,when the sun glinted off something about a foot in front of my face. I stopped quick,and it was a really large green spider(3-4 inches across) in a web right in front of my face. It blended in perfectly with its surroundings. If the sun hadn't reflected off it,I would have walked into it face first. I can't give a better description than green,because I ran off screaming like the teenage girl I was,lol.
---
I now live in Arizona,the home of more types of rattlesnakes than I care to think about,Black Widows,Desert Recluses,Scorpions,Mountain Lions,Coyotes etc,and off course the scorching blast furnace of heat we call summer. Really makes me wonder about my life choices sometimes.
---
Nope. You only need 1 of the weapon modifiers or the armor piece.
---
I launch 3-6 nukes a day , nothing is stopping you from gong thru the process to see how it works. I’d definitely find a nuke runner to show you and then show you the fast way after. After you run a 7 minute nuke run you feel like a total badass
---
TS has highest damage number (non bloodied/junky), Instigating is good except for mobs (splash damage), AA is ok.
---
I have TS, AA, Quad, Instigating, Bloodied and Junkies.
---
For one shotting big enemies TS all day (as long as VATS/magic is used)
---
Quad for clearing out West Tek and Whitespring, still one shots those suckers and 32 shots without reload.
---
They all suck against Earle though...
---
Shit, that’s me not getting any then😂
---
This is why I have a box of half walls so my companion cant actually leave, being under the map she struggles to get back some times
---
r/unexpectedmontypython
---
Sorry you Uggo.
---
I've been waiting for content long enough. I feel like in a private sever half the problems wouldn't be just that. I can solo the guy if need be, but I'm tired of waiting tbh
---
You met a duper. They do this often not to be generous but to get so many copies out there that they are harder to get caught.
---
Fantastic Idea. Seriously...
---
Fast travel bug comes before anything else though.  I’ve got my doctorate in hitting start and selecting my location over a dozen times.
---
Kings are the only thing in the game that I have to worry about if I don't put them down instantly.
---
I have  assassins, berserkers, and instigating 3\* shovels, two with the 90% reduction. I took them off my wall of shame to save camp space, so far I've had 15 shovels on this one character so there's never a problem with carrying my own shovel to this event. 
---
I rarely go a week without picking up at least a couple more - though last night mama murgh gave me two 3\* switchblades with 90% reduction...so, maybe hope.
---
Lol. Dies in 2 seconds why u get your build sorted out
---
No problem
---
Oh sweet. My suggestions still stand I suppose on how it could work.
---
Did you see the rusted key in there also? That is your first clue. Gotta figure out where that goes. 
---
...it is still useless, but the ammo does exist.
---
Fr? Do you think imma get banned for having the weapon
---
Second? There is like 5 I know of all right there.
---
It uses alien blaster rounds, you can get 3 from a bunker so they’re pretty useless. But you can get the plans to change it to a fusion cell weapon, overall this gun is very much useless you’d probably do more damage overall with a spiked baseball bat
---
Mirelurk king is easily top 3 roughest enemies to fight. SB are kinda of weak sauce there not even top 5 sadly. I remember when I used to be scared of SB, now its like a flying snack with good food buffs.
---
Its the 3rd or 4th hole in the wall from the left. Should have a crispy scorched kneeling. Put the stairs of the tent right through him. All the scorched should spawn in a tight group next to the signal generator. 
---
Or so I've heard.
---
Pretty useless. You can get the ammo from some mine I think. Or find a plan to make it use fusion cells, and do less damage. You can get a legendary one from finishing the astronaut lady's quest line
---
No shovel needed for those.
---
Also if he was a duper wouldn’t he of taken the caps I offered?
---
When Wastelanders first came out the Gauss Shotgun was crazy powerful.  Especially the bloodied was wrecking everything.  I believe the range was nerfed down to normal, thus taking away its King status.  That said, the explosive damage that goes with it makes it the best shotgun in the game.  In Vats, with the right modifiers, it will one shot most enemies....at least in range.  
---
I have an Instigating Gauss shotgun that’s pretty good, but then I don’t spec my characters for shotguns.  Just to weird of a niche for me.
---
Can confirm! Some kind stranger gave me a bag of decent weapons when I first came out of the vault...! Was half expecting to be shot at tbh
---
Hey, me and my 3 star shovel have done things!
---
i've been looking for ways to boost my charisma and I overlooked this! thank you
---
The place where you found the blaster has a key which opens a door in the house of horrors east from the red rocket truck stop.
---
Yep happens to me at least 2 to 3 times a day.
---
Totally useless gun. It’s very buggy with the way the rounds blast thru targets before registering hits. Don’t even think about using VATS with it. The rounds are farmable but you’ll need TNT dome 2 access.
---
No I doubt it. its not a hacked weapon which would get you banned, its just a copy of an existing one. I wouldnt worry about it.
---
Damn
---
I was lucky and one dropped the second time I did it. Gave it to my girlfriend but haven't had any others drop despite us doing it about twenty more times. :)
---
And yet, there was that point where everyone was swimming in jetpacks. And making the limb plans drop is just such a waste considering you learn the set for free.
---
He killed my Bear before the first meat week. Apparently meat is meat.
---
I guess Bethesda also felt that mini-nukes were not up to the task of clearing some rocks. 
---
The worst part is that it removes a few nice camp locations from general use. No one wants to be constantly hopping servers or having their camp destroyed constantly.
---
Yes! I did that already. Thanks for clarifying
---
Join a very active pc group in the Enclave discord, https://discord.gg/7g5mGjz
---
Jetpacks are a common plan drop haha. Yeah the set plans are very stupid
---
Three sir!
---
Personally, I recommend field testing AA and Furious to see which is the better fit for you, and scrip the others. Keep rolling, tho. Vampires is a very good effect for tank builds, as already discussed. If you hit on a Zealots, that can be good to prime for SBQ fights.
---
I feel that,  the content is MIA.  Yeah it wouldn’t matter so much in a private world,  idk though I prefer public worlds for most things.
---
The tiny screen combined with the fact that Sell x1 is right below Buy x100 is a FUCKING NIGHTMARE. Imagine trying to sell 3 missiles and using all your points to buy 300. 
---
If I do, which would be easy because I can't read the tiny interface, I'm submitting a support ticket for my points back.
---
This is exactly why I have a BSS90 shovel.
---
It’s one or the other. You do not need a magical weapon effect and a separate armor effect.
---
Please fix this I’ve lost hundreds of hours over this right now and I’m waiting for the fix
---
One helpful tip that I (level 192) just learned is if you lose a legendary body, you can use your camera (if you’ve complete that quest) to help you locate where the meat pile might be hiding.
---
Yeah iv lot a few pets like that... Luckily my deathclaw has stayed with me for a few months now without issue
---
There are also some places that have static NPC spawns that you can camp at. I had one place that spawned two regularly so along with my ally the place was pretty bustling.
---
Not everything works that way.  I had a Bloodied LD Minigun and it didn’t need an accelerated barrel or the armor... it just clapped checks.
---
The vanilla story wasn't bad by any stretch. There was something really eerie/horrifying about coming out into a wasteland where every single person is dead. Like a zombie apocalypse movie where every single group of survivors *lost.* As much as I like Wastelanders (which does make the game feel more Fallout-y), and bugs aside, I sometimes miss the feeling I had when playing the game right after it released.
---
Good luck on that building envelope.  That would be one leaky roof and no warranty!
---
finally, my survival tent can be moved to somewhere else now.
---
Well as far as the ladder part goes, you could just click it and be teleported up with a short loading screen or something. But apparently they are going to be adding instanced underground camps eventually (which I didnt know at the time of writing this post)  I guess we'll see how it turns out though.
---
I main gauss shotgun, the vats is still glitched and 1 shots everything. Like 9/10 times I fire in vats the shot has no spread and works like a lazer beam
---
That assumes that the dev team has the ability to make changes to the data types used. They may very well not have that ability, and it may be too risky to make such a change this Far in as it would introduce a ton of chances for bugs in the new ammo system. And that’s assuming they could even make the change. Remember this team is using an engine they got directly from the larger Bethesda studio, and that studio would have made the deliberate choice to program the vendor interface that way. 
---
And even if they could make such a change, floats are larger than integer values. That’s a lot more data to transfer over the servers when you start sending all vendor data. If they could contain the changes to only the ammo point interface it might work, but ammo objects are not necessarily different than any other and changes would likely need to apply to all items
---
There is a Respec system but it requires you to spend a level up point to move SPECIAL points around. After level 50.
---
Its the price of vanity unfortunately 😔
---
Ammo has always been a heavily duped games item. Can’t imagine that it wasn’t forefront of their minds when implementing the converter.
---
No! my BSS90 shovel will feel so lonely if I do that =/
---
The game is a mess because they keep releasing content too soon and without enough testing, so no, take your time. I’d rather they worked on fixing bugs then adding new ones.
---
I am so frustrated by locations that have a shower running all the time, especially the ones where all the vendor machines are on the other side. I lost my mutations twice because of this. I was pretty happy when I finally got starched genes.
---
I kill all black widows at my house with a blow torch just to be safe. This did lead to me nearly burning down my garage but luckily I had a hose nearby and no major damage was done. Worth it for the peace of mind though.
---
I think you are correct. The only difference I would suggest would be to block the player who's camp is where yours is. That way, if you server hop for whatever reason, the risk is a little less.
---
I wasn't aware of that either. I've looked into the datamined stuff but didn't see anything about instances underground camps. I'll believe it when I see it, and if they do make it happen, then I'll definitely be a happy camper.
---
I'm saving that 250 Scrip from the legendary run, until the Purveyor super sale.. use up all my scrip and then claim it
---
Also makes that very satisfying thump noise..
---
Which is why I'm in two minds about it, I don't think it should be given away for free,  but it needs to be fairly easily accessible by everyone, but if not gating it behind rep, then what perhaps finishing or reaching a certain part of the main quest?
---
Check out Angry Turtle's video. It really does an amazing job explaining this.
---
Yeah you and me both, but one of the other people who commented u/Tenebrate talked about it.
---
I have the same gun and it doesn't clap clap...not on the queen anyway. I don't kbow what i'm doing wrong,I tried with and without all the perks I could use. Only thing I didn't try are ultra5mm.
---
Very good tip!
---
Sigh...
---
Meat Week starts today at 10 eastern. A Colossal Problem has not been added for consoles yet.
---
Meat week in about 10 mins
---
Most perks I run are for carry weight.
---
Pretty useless gun. If you see anyone using one to great effect on the PC platform it’s because they are a dirty dirty cheater and have a hacked version.
---
No news on Colossal problem for console
---
I feel this deep, deep in my bones...
---
weren t they aiming to release it today? the least they can do is providing us an ETA because it can come today aswell as in a month
---
I don't know if it was a weird one time thing, but I got a nice legendary RR rifle the other day and realized I didn't know many mods for it. So I popped Super Duper on and built maybe 20 and scrapped them. Wound up over encumbered from thousands of spikes that came from nowhere when the guns were scrapped. Minimum level guns are cheap to build and there's a magazine that gives -50% cost.
---
I mean that’s just Metal Gear Solid, right?
---
No, not everyone has great uny stuff, that’s why i still use PA
---
I read the comment. Definitely would be interesting, but I'm curious how large they plan on making them in order to improve the camp budget. Maybe it'll help cut down on displays and decor overeating into the budget.
---
What event? Where is this?
---
Oh so it’s an hourly thing?
---
You can’t have FFR and Explosive on the same weapon! You must have meant Faster Reload.
---
When did you start the season? I started about 2 weeks ago and im only on 33
---
It’s a fucking joke. People are still experiencing this issue and they don’t seem to even be trying to fix it.
---
I honestly thought it had something to do with legendary and how often they would spawn.
---
good call
---
I take it this is frequently asked question?
---
I met the raider punk at Flatwoods... 🤔
---
Nice.I wish I knew how to get it.
---
I use it for stabilzed. As a heavy gunner I find it very helpful, the aa it gives is a ruffly 25% damage boost and the accuracy buff is nice as well
---
Yep. I got two raiders that hang out and complain about lack of loot. Occasionally they murder some low lvl player that comes to my camp.
---
Hopefully. I would imagine, at most, it would be another camp and a hlaf of space extra than what we have now. I think even that is pushing it though.
---
What's wrong with the USPS?
---
&lt;fallout76 went from a fun sandbox shooter to"
---
I'm gonna stop you right there
---
On my lower level character I use canned meat stew and when people use the tent glitch, just chuck some mines down and then you get a hit and they all get mowed down and you get easy exp
---
Yeah it's hourly and primal cuts is every 15 minutes
---
unless you're sneaking, PA is generally better due to its inherent damage reduction. yeah, regular armor gets sentinel and serendipity and people love to boast about how tanky bloodied builds are, but that's not really the case.
---
I always do that one. 120 caps, plenty of steel and screws, 15 bullets or less, and 3 minutes of work!
---
The 42% damage reduction aint to shabby either
---
Thanks! You guys are way more helpful than google
---
Lol. That’s awesome.
---
The only case I remember hearing about this happening was the guy would had over 900hrs and to much ammo. Other than that I haven't heard of anyone getting banned that wasn't cheating.
---
Once you meet the ally and agree for them to stay with you. In the camp menu, you will find your ally under allies, place the item for the ally, and they appear. I didn't know that lol I was waiting and wondering why my ally didn't come to my place? then I found out the Allies tab in the camp menu.
---
It's certainly a possibility. They might also just try to adapt the Vault 88 formula from the "Vault-Tec Workshop" expansion from 4; underground area that's largely preset, but we can dig through sections for resources until the whole map is revealed and build through there.  
---
Again, the most information we have on it is from the QuakeCon interview and that just boils down "We're working on it, it's how we're going to address budgets in the long run."
---
probably gonna start at the daily auto-completion
---
It's quite fun,but the prime cuts events get repetitive really fast.
---
Also I see you often in NW lately.
---
If they release both events for console, Bethesda was full of shit regarding the delay of meat week to allow people to have some time with A Colossal Problem.
---
yes.
---
Just take the junkyard or whatever, and wait two minutes to defend it. Can't find an event? Make your own!
---
Also the farmhand event takes like two minutes to do, the robots are full of lead and steel, and if you take an extra minute to clean out the ag center, there's loads of pencils, desk fans, and clipboards inside.
---
For scorched, i like the airport. 
---
I second leader of the pack for legendaries.
---
This is a great idea. Could be a cool boss fight aswell.
---
Don't you dare blame Meat Week. Chally has feelings, you know.
---
Oops! I checked and don’t see anything so I figured a post would be fine
---
They said "around" 10 weeks, not 10 weeks exactly. Mid September is not the 8th bud no matter what calendar you use. Either way I really don't care, I will be done by September 1st and if not i'll buy my way to the end, but I'm pretty sure I won't need it.
---
That would be pretty cool, but I mean at this point, I would be fine with anything.
---
I have ultracite PA that I love for harder fights. I haven’t spent much time on my non, but am safe without in many situations. 
---
🤷🏼‍♀️ I’ll continue to use both.
---
Poison resistance armor helps immensely against mirelurks. Just one piece greatly improves survivability.
---
Honestly, I'd be happy with a sort-by-weight that used the weight of the stack instead of individual stack items.
---
Right? Pretty sure lots of folks have 11 points in luck, distributed like this.
---
There's an interview from QuakeCon this year where they talk, very briefly, about it.  
---
Managed to track down a link, so give it a gander.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbSVGM65dY&amp;list=PLb28WddE5bfStbMUhtH6sSwJ7HJR0mrHE&amp;index=6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbSVGM65dY&amp;list=PLb28WddE5bfStbMUhtH6sSwJ7HJR0mrHE&amp;index=6)
---
This is why I love Meat Week more than Fasnacht Day. Contributions matter.
---
Working on my first build now. TIL
---
I was kinda running with the thought all the cards I needed would be available at level 50. Ouch.
---
Luckily I’m only at 25 now, so it probably won’t be awful to fix it
---
I will be doing my part by AFK'ing the shit out of either one of those spits or drums while working from home. It ain't much, but it's something.
---
To properly min/max a heavy gunner build you need PA.
---
A post is fine he’s being a whiney kid LMFAO. 1) if it’s so annoying dont comment? Common sense. 2) YOU DONT HAVE TO ANSWER there’s thousands of us😂 people just want to be dicks online
---
Will do, thanks for that!
---
its very easy to play in PA..
---
PA is not under powered.. PA perfectly fills the slot between regular armor and legendary armor..
---
its got good DR, you can dance around in nuke zones, survive jumping off the tallest objects in the game and if your STR is under 11 it will raise your carry weight.. all before you mod a single piece
---
PA is good stuff and is perfect in its role...
---
Yup.  At crater is just his guaranteed spawn but you can meet any of the 3 generic companions in the wild too. 🙂
---
I dig it.
---
I use a Berserkers FFR and do roughly 1600 with half health with Adrenal Reaction and before Adrenaline even kicks in. After a few kills the damage gets up pretty high. But the reload bug is super annoying and I kill myself with this weapon a lot
---
I wasn’t offended by their sigh, more confused. Either way it’s Reddit and I don’t take it seriously
---
Lmfao whoever said PA is underpowered compared to Armor is dumb. Use emergency protocols on a bloodied PA character &amp; you won’t know what dying is
---
I agree.
---
This.
---
Yeah I wasn’t saying you were I’m just tired of the attitudes on this sub. If the question is repetitive dont answer. There’s thousands that will without being a douche about it🤷🏽‍♂️ just in my opinion
---
Its a daily.  Buried with honor.
---
Go see the curator at Ft picket, find the remains, take them to Phillipi cemetery, bury them.
---
For the people in the back:  if you are just going to afk this event, afk on the meat spits and the center or stage right drum.
---
Stage left drum is mine!
---
Well. People kept complaining there should be more boss battles initiated by a nuke.  You got it now.  I played it last night, had a great time.  With my Gauss shotgunner, I mostly did crowd control on the Wendigos and between then crippling the heads. I got the plushy plan so was otherwise happy with the results.
---
I am a Junkies full health build. Reduces incoming damage by almost half.  Build in Rad resistance.  Stabilized for heavy guns.  I use Excavator for extra carry weight. I uses dodgy with Kinetic dynamo and action boy.  Takes a lot for me to die.  Like a lot.
---
I think there should be lots of underground cave systems in the ash heap were we discover our new insect overlords.
---
Same here... Can play with my wife...Sitting next to me.....
---
Fair enough
---
What does this have to do with the writing?
---
I run excavator with calibrated shocks for a heavy gunner build. I don't need to worry about weight reduction for my heavy weapons since that's an extra 200 lbs carry weight
---
No problem.
---
The entire interview is actually pretty good, and speaks well to state of things.
---
Life is pipe.
---
Yep just started on my server too!
---
It aint much, but its honest work.
---
What build you aiming at?
---
I'm intrigued to see how it works out, but if I don't get some Vault-Tec themed building supplies I'm going to be disappointed.
---
It'ld be really weird to have a Red Rocket/Slocum's Joe combo beneath the Cranberry Bog. My drivethru business would be terrible!
---
So not an event?
---
use electrical door and triggering pressure plates on both sides, works like automatic doors at most grocery stores...i had the same issue but that's how i solved it, no ai enemies make it inside anymore
---
The same as all automatic stim abilities in the game: whatever heals the least, first.  Healing salve, diluted Stimpaks, Stimpaks, super Stimpaks.
---
I don't know, I would have gone with the following quest line for the nuke:
---
Ward - 'Someone has stolen my coffee mug. I need you to nuke the person responsible since simply killing them will not be enough! I don't even care about the mug since I found it in the trash somewhere but it is the PRINCIPLE that matters.'
---
I'm a full health PA user and the 42% damage ignore combined with a medic torso on the Excavator PA is quite enough for 99% of the encounters, including the SBQ. The 1% is the Encryptid, poisonous Mirelurks or particularly aggressive Assaultrons. For the robots, I have a full set of Troubleshooter's (75% ignore). I find it generally not worth carrying 4-5 sets of versus armor just because I meet a Super Mutant or Scorched. Also there is no versus against humans, mole miners or wendigos (sentinel is not that good in my experience).
---
I run with 70lbs on my character and 400 in my stash , weight management is a huge issue most people in this game never seem to conquer. You gotta stop caring about items and embrace the fun, those plans that didn’t sell last week they aren’t gonna sell this week my friend
---
Nice idea but how do you define a griefer? And what fool proof plan to know who they are?
---
Some people define griefers by people attacking them at workshops, and you know workshops are pvp zones
---
Yeah, the problem I always get good effects with 1 star xD But I narrowed my choice to AA and furious. Thanks a lot!
---
I accidentally took some junk out of a dresser (or toolbox, or some other container) at a workshop that was claimed and got a wanted status.  It's not like it was in a locked container and was just in a normal container that appears in all of the locations in the game.  Within about 3 minutes some level 200+ player fast traveled to me and lit me up.  
---
If I knew I could get a 3\* legendary for picking a 0 level lock, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
---
And it looks cool! I have X-01 with a red headlamp so when my pipboy light is on my eyes glow red.
---
PC or console?
---
The system is a mess and there is sustained bitching on the PTS board, so go there and complain as well.
---
It seems so simply to make it a diablo 3 paragon type system, where you level your account.  Why this perk coin mess has been latched onto by someone in power is beyond me.  It’s asinine and punishes long term players or people that have altered their build, you know, the kind of people you are trying to reward with this system.
---
It could be like one of those Taco Bell and Pizza Hut combo buildings split down the middle.  Wouldn't be too terrible.
---
I mounted mine on a display board.
---
They failed to find the balance between the hard core daily players, the working parents, and the weekend warriors.   The better solution, instead of daily and weekly challenges, would be weeklies consisting of the dailies with slightly higher requirements but all doable over a weekend session and "legendary run" challenges replacing the weeklies which would award a large score total but also require the work to be put in.  ie, Instead of collect 5 of "X" from scrapping for 1000 score, collect 50 for 10000.    Instead of a weekly of level up 3 times for 1500 score it would be 30 times for 35000 or something to that extent.   Obviously the weekly list would include enough to make sure if you put a decent amount of work in you'll finish the run.  Same goes for the "Legendary Run" ones.   
---
You shouldn't be penalized for not being able to play an hour every single day.
---
The daily grinders would have no problem getting the run done.
---
The 9-5ers/parents wouldn't have to worry about missing a day here and there and still should be able to finish the run.
---
The weekend warriors have time to bang out their stuff as well and should be able to complete most if not all of the run.
---
When I tried this the other day, you still only get credit for picking one plant.
---
Those will come with the update, when it is released for consoles, per Bethesda.
---
It *should* be on console but I’m not 100% sure as I’m on PC
---
yeah i wish they would overhaul it to just make a new instance/world instead of having to load a another world to check if someone is there.
---
Well somebody's got to cook and provide the beats. Thank you for the effort.
---
No you have to buy the Gatling plasma plan &amp; make them &amp; scrap
---
On PC, he has. For consoles, you have to wait a few days until we, PC people test the Colossal event and the patch.
---
Its started now! Just got my first 8 primal cuts!
---
They said they would fix it this week but they didnt of course.  you have two options. You can either server hop to get it done. It may take one two or Twenty times. Or complete it on someone's private server. It's a glitch where if someone did it recently on the public server it just won't happen again until everything on the server resets which is I don't know when.
---
Why do you have to delete and reinstall?
---
“Should” is a pretty loaded word these days 😅 we’ll see!
---
[basically this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4b2699&amp;d=sd2so2sp2st1sb0su2pc2pe0ic4ih0c70es2e00en1eh2at1as2au0a72eg1&amp;w=lt2le2ld2)
---
I got some feedback about the perks I chose here, and I’ll be swapping some out.
---
My end-game goal for this account is to use junkie’s shotguns with VATS and power armor.
---
It seems like an easyish play style (I’m trash at FPS. Can’t stand CoD, battle royales, etc) that will be up-close and exciting to play.
---
In other fallouts, my go-to is usually sniping and stealth-focused, so I wanted to try something else.
---
I’m also working on a plan to do a randomly-generated SPECIAL build on another account later. I’ve about figured out how to generate the stats to keep them from always being close to 8-8-8-8-8-8-8
---
It explains why people need to throw atomic bombs to move a few boulders?
---
Honesty..... I only go to that area for rad roaches back in the day, and if I'm there may as well do the mission... Could never find the bloody shovel xD
---
But at max reps we really have 0 incentive to travel there unless you want an extra loading screen just to make it cheaper to travel across the map.
---
Had a dream last night of me getting a Bloodied Swing speed +1 strength bear arm. I was sooo excited.
---
Untill i saw it was level 20
---
There are people devoted to the cult of the meta. I give those folks a friendly PA wave when I see them on SBQ battlefield, and I’m pretty sure I’ve stimpaked more than a few of their glass cannon disciples during the fights.
---
PC:  the PTS+
---
what outfit is that?
---
Ah alright. Thanks for your help. I don’t think I wanna pay all that money for the plan then spend all that junk, so I’ll probably just keep buying them in singles until I get those last two mods.
---
Every so often I'll run into a mod for sale, sometimes even at player vendors or get one rewarded as a repeatable quest loot pool drop,the rifled barrel is the thing I see most commonly. I too only have the beam splitter unlocked to my knowledge, and my plasma has been my main for over a year now
---
I don't believe I said I wouldn't try it. Just that I wouldn't have a lot of time to get all the rewards because of work. Sorry that offends your fragile state of being but some people gotta do what they gotta do.
---
Old thread but i'll add: Ran into a group of level 1 invincible attack dogs just outside the Vault-tec Agricultural research center (west of flatwood) they chased me onto a truck, used about 5 stimpaks, eventually killed one. (TL;DR It just works)
---
Update: Switched to spiked baseball bat, managed to kill all of them.
---
Correction: In June 30 and July 2 communications they said season 1 is 10 weeks. [See link and quote above. ](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/id5dew/_/g27jg5o/?context=1)
---
In the announcements about seasons in general, they said they run for around 10 weeks.
---
Again, still waiting for where you claim they said they are 76 days...
---
You’re so cool
---
I think you give it to Grahm during Meat Week and he gives you scrip
---
Is it when your in the screen where it says press a button to log in then it crashes after the box appears in the top right after you pressed a button?
---
everyone in it looks the same to me.. 
---
its always the same handful of skins running around
---
I think they need to give a bit longer on the escape time after the Colossus goes down.  I only got out with like 10 seconds to spare, almost didn't have time to get the chest at the end.
---
Just did it on ps4 so I reckon it’s across all platforms
---
Turn it in at Grahms cookout for scrip
---
I’m curious as to what you mean by griefing. With pacifist on,I’m not sure how anyone in the game is getting killed via non-consensual pvp (ala Workshops) unless it’s due to a bug. Bugs are a separate issue and several were patched recently.
---
Ok , where can i find him ?
---
alright, thanks for your help. I’ll keep that in mind.
---
That's kind of what is now, it's just going to be a challenge to get people dropping by if they have to climb through a hatch to get there.
---
Hard to "Drive in, Fly out" which so much dirt in the way.
---
Granted, I say that knowing full well half my garage is hanging over a bog, but I have yet to see a building inspector to call me out on that!
---
BIG BRAIN MOVE: only have tents in your camp. No doors to open or close.
---
Yep. And the worst part is that the best tamed pets die the easiest, dogs, cats, chickens.  
---
They did update things about tames a few times, such as other players ability to kill them, but they still almost never last more than a few days. I wish they would just make them essential like allies, or not involved in combat at all. It really is a.shame based on how hard the right tame can be to find, and how needlessly feel-bad it is when they die.
---
Jokes on you I ain’t got no toilet, Beckett and I just shit off the side of the cliff #savagedividegang
---
Sometimes it is not your camp. It is your survival tent that cannot be place, but the window says camp. I have done this and said stay on this world and camp is still there.... Not sure if Bethesda is aware of it, but it has been going on for some time now and sure does need fixed.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
You can't. I have that and it is not equippable to my PA for one reason or another, whether thats because it doesn't work for ultracite or that it needs the full skin to be equipped.
---
I had this problem. The only way it fixed was to delete the game and saved game files and re download it
---
A file got corrupted. 
---
You still keep your characters since their stored on the server except your photos you’ve taken in the photo gallery but it should still be in photo capture on PS4.
---
There are donation barrels that you drop it in during the Meat Week event (event must be active for them to count). There is a limit of 5 per event I believe. You are rewarded scrip. 
---
The meat also expires rather fast, so be advised you cannot hoard it.
---
The problem is that, if they want to release it on console, they have to get through Microsoft and Sony first, which is NOT fun to do and expensive. I can kind of see their point in releasing it first on PC and then on a later date, polished on console. I wish they would do this every time from now on, instead of delaying it for EVERYONE for two weeks.
---
I've never not been able to use the shovel that's like 2 feet from the grave. It's always there.
---
Just attempted primal cuts and as soon as it started the server went bananas and I get DCd at the end.
---
At least Bethesda is consistent with their incompetence.
---
How many times does this guy have to be buried??
---
Give it time
---
You will see him when the cookout starts
---
Who's been here longer the Chinese or BoS. I'm gonna cast my cards and say the Chinese. Knowing them they'll sneak their way in anywhere (Justifying lore btw)
---
I'll have to look into it, does it actually work reasonably?
---
You need to be ahead of Zorb or else atoms. Im on 62 and feel your pain. You should be on 82-85ish currently to finish.
---
Every hour, on the hour, there will be an event called Graham’s cookout (near vault 76 iirc). Join that event and while you’re there give him the meat
---
Wow, i might just delete it and leave it I have honestly had enough of this crap
---
Will a legendary be awarded at the end like in fasnacht?
---
The downvotes astroturfing. Someone downvoting EVERYTHING with the smallest hint of negative toward beth. 
---
Totally feel dicked they decided to exclusive release for PC. Garbage they didn't give it to us too. No mention till the day before again. Just garbage really.
---
Everything else looked fine overall.
---
I had trouble with this quest a few weeks ago before I knew there was a bigger bug with it.  I eventually got it working once I logged back in with the character the next day.  I did play with a different character between then, so I'm not sure if that was part of it fixing itself.
---
It’s a very rare problem but ya it sucks.
---
Just had the same with the fog crawlers in the bog.
---
Ok , is it easy to miss? Or i donate while prime cut event is active ?
---
Dunno, just used one in a camp I visited yesterday.
---
If i remember right, yes at full bar. But they could have changed it like with fasnacht
---
We all blue screen here , join us
---
I always think the Fog Crawlers are Ant Lion Queens at first glance. They look very similar.
---
Ok , thank you very much
---
This would be awesome, but if folks could see it in action they would realize it's probably broken before buying it. Can't have that.
---
To be fair, CAMP stuff has tended to be less broken, but with about 6 places on the entire world map they can be placed.
---
*Eh* **'hyep**
---
Can confirm this did work for me.
---
I love people running towards robots and then dieing from their explosions :&lt;)
---
I wish the door worked like that whitespring golf club where it opens automatically, hey wait I think Bethesda will now sell an automatic door for 500 atoms.. done!
---
Yeah the spawn points seem a lot more spread out this year
---
People on /r/fo76 are weird and extremely selective in their narrative. We have experienced hundreds of situations involving poor game management, broken game design, flawed codes, bugs, messy game mechanics and extremely questionable practice from Bethesda...
---
However, when it comes to ban, for some reason people struggle to believe (or even assume) that false positives can happen and instead prefer to argue thate every ban in history of FO76 was justified... In one of the most broken MMO out there. Even if arguing in this direction means grouping real victim in the lot. People would rather shame potential true victim of Bethesda's flawed practice than open up to the idea that yes, Bethesda can screw up even there.
---
Like how does that even make sense?
---
For what it's worth, [I was unfairly banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/) back in April of this year, a false positive. Woke up one morning to a mail stating I was flagged for the use of third party devices to dupe, which I've never done, I'm a clean player. Then one week later, I was told they had strong evidences (that they never shared) and my ban was now permanent... Only to stealthly unban me three days later.
---
I was never told what happened, how it happened nor apologized to. My own personal researches lead me to realize that picking up any duped item *can* flag you and all the mails I received were automated/generic. So I may have unknowingly picked up *something duped* in *one random loot bag* at some point. 
---
&gt;  I haven't heard of anyone getting banned that wasn't cheating.
---
The reason why eople don't talk about it openly on reddit is because the minute someone try to plead his case, he/she's instantly shamed, accused of being a liar, a cheater and so on. There is no way for anyone to prove their innocence unless they record 100% of their playtime. Also, most of them probably don't bother talking about it and argue with customer support instead.
---
Bottom line is, false positives are not a myth.
---
hallelujah
---
It depends how close it is really. When Meat Week first happened my long time CAMP was like DIRECTLY beneath it and I didn't have to move. The sales from my vendor that week though $$$
---
It just works, it just works, it just works.
---
Sorry I couldn't resist lol 😎
---
If they do it for every blue screen I can understand the frustration lol , my crew just does the “ dammit I blue screened “ chant and we all laugh while they jump back in
---
Primal Cuts is when you kill animals for meat (every 15 minutes). At the top of every hour is the Meat Week event, which is a cookout. The barrels are in the center of the cookout. The meat can only be donated during the actual cookout event (when the timer/status bar are active).
---
Are you talking about the one that for instance if I choose to FT to whitesprings and I land at say V-9, ot the one where I FT to my desktop
---
There used to be Survival mode in which you could PVP without restrictions, Bethesda got rid of it. "Griefers" as you call them are just playing the game. Use pacifist mode if you dont want to fight.
---
"I don’t make the final few survivors hunt me if I think they’re grouped. I’ll stand up and wave them over so everyone can save a bit of time."
---
Same. If I get down to a team of 4 and me left I always take off all my armor (and outfits) and drop all my weapons before sneaking out for a naked wave hello. Occasionally one of them will give me a proper warriors death by fistfighting me to the end. Lol. 
---
Congrats on the win. I've only got 2 wins on my way to rank 47 so far, 1 solo bush wookie and 1 in the first week when I was trying to give it a fair chance as a battle royale before realizing it is actually hide and seek instead.
---
awww shit ITS MEAT TIME!
---
Whenever I get a blue screen, I just restart the game.
---
Coz it looks cool and I wanna look like a transformer !! /s
---
WOOT WOOT!!!!
---
Well, from the screenshots it’s the exact same spot. I’ll know for sure tomorrow
---
If I don’t have to move it, imma gonna have to put the cool stuff on my vendors ;)
---
I want to plop down something as big as the pumpkin house or that garage near Riverside Manor.
---
I want mega structures. Don't mind if they take up 50% budget because that's usually how I split it between building/decorating anyway.
---
Same!  Just going to rotate through characters while I work. :)
---
Haven't seen this bug, what is it?
---
Gimli ffs, not now!
---
Always see it at Encryptid. 2-3 people always run towards the sheepsquatch. I don't even use a headset but still shout at the TV "don't go near it!" Haha
---
I just hit lvl 98 on the board yesterday.  If I can go from lvl 500 to 501 that day, I will.  If not, I don’t.  Clearly there’s enough excess points from the 10k challenge to make up the difference.
---
saw the Brotherhood tag and my brain just connect your faction to it, so i just imagine a BoS knight who's too cool for power armor.
---
just check the existing threads
---
On console it’s - 
---
Open map &gt; find destination &gt; click fast travel free//pay caps &gt; map closes and you don’t move. 
---
Repeat &gt; repeat &gt; repeat &gt; repeat &gt; scream at Tv &gt; repeat &gt; repeat.
---
I've never had this issue. Not saying it doesn't happen just that I haven't had this problem. And my camp is by Whitespring too. Only a handful of times have I had the "C.A.M.P cannot be placed" message and it put me right into a world that it could place it.
---
For DAILIES only. Some people mistakenly think weeklies also get doubled. Dailies only.
---
😭
---
So I just press options and delete it and then reinstall it?
---
Maybe he invented Psycho Jet
---
Thats funny because there were posts all over reddit for a while of people bejng falsly banned. Not all of them could havw been fake.
---
Yeah problem is...allies. Allies LOVE to act like they were born in a barn.  Need one of the mod devices from fallout 4 that auto-closes your doors after x amount of seconds of being open.
---
If you could build your camp there, you should be fine.  
---
Normally you wouldn't be able to build in a zone that was flagged for something else; that was how some of the Wastelander changes became apparent before it went live as people were given notices that their camp was now in a no-build zone. Given Meat Week's happened before, that zone should be flagged for a while now.  
---
Either way, I'm intrigued to hear how it turns out.
---
You sure you was not in a group before the message, that's 1 reason wich i know it Will make you go looping around to the same world no matter how many Times you click yes for searching a different world!
---
I think he’s runs his power armour in commando so he can hop out for a spot of naked punching. It’s an...interesting sight to see.
---
Mmmmmmmmmm, meat...
---
Good info. My first thought as I read this was "glad i haven't completed the new weeklies"
---
I hear this all the time, but I've never found a single shovel in that area.
---
Edit: granted, I haven't done the event since the last patch, so I don't know if that's changed anything
---
Honestly it ain’t much work
---
Edited post so it's at the top, forgot to mention that. Thank you
---
I’ll let you know tomorrow :)
---
I use fusion &amp; plasma cores all the times its my build and I generally buy them all from people from 5-162caps a piece haha I spend probably 30k caps a week doing this
---
It's amazing how they keep adding things that deter players from actually playing the game
---
That does suck. If you get some time, see you at Graham’s barbecue
---
Its not just about false positive bans either. If it becomes clear you dont actually play the game the gates are shut to discussion and it doesnt matter what you say they dont care you are wrong and the game is just fine haters gonna hate.
---
But if you can make them think you suffer through all the bullshit too then they will admit how bad the game is.
---
Yes after that you delete delete it’s saved files. Don’t redownload it right after. 
---
To be even more on the safe side you can reorganize the database on your system before the install if you have not done that in a long time.
---
Generally you do that once every 6 months to a year on ps4 systems.
---
Someone reported that they had to do this but it only a single post about this.
---
But I didn’t have to.
---
It would appear that you live in a world without spellcheck.
---
That's some advanced learning a.i. but unfortunately they have been studying the bush wookie strategy from NW. Just stay still and stay alive.
---
Page file.
---
Have you reduced it at all? FO76 simply cannot operate without the page file. Larger the better it seems.
---
I don’t ever pick up armor most of the time. It’s usually stands out too much for me.
---
Yeah same with honey beasts near top of the world.
---
Just so what everyone else does and use that as an opportunity to dupe. Unless they fixed that exploit. I dunno. Only time that has happened to me was when I placed my camp on Creek by the junkyard outside vault 76. I didn't even know of that exploit at the time, and so early in the game I had nothing worth duplicating. I always try to place my camp in obscured places.
---
On console it’s -
---
Open map &gt; find destination &gt; click fast travel free//pay caps &gt; map closes and you don’t move.
---
Repeat &gt; repeat &gt; repeat &gt; repeat &gt; scream at Tv &gt; repeat &gt; repeat and finally you travel to destination.
---
You have this in GTA Online, its called Bad sport lobbies, if you start blowing everything up and killing everyone you end up in one of those lobbies for a few days...then you go back to normal servers again. If you keep griefing you keep going to those bad lobbies for a longer and longer time.
---
Its not perfect but it kinda works, i guess Bethesda could do something like that in fallout aswell.
---
Edit: I like the Pacifist option better btw.
---
My main is an herbivore. But I am happy to have another fun community event that's fun
---
its only the greatest seasonal event of all.. thats what it is!
---
Think no nut November in reverse
---
I'll be there once it re sets haha. Just don't have the time I use to so need to time my level ups well lol
---
See you there I'll be the dude in the responders fireman outfit and makeshift rhonie helm roasting things with a flamer (might also be in my hell fire pa lol)
---
I do the same, I log off before I’m about to level up and save it for the next day, your not alone 😂
---
oh damn. yeah i can see how that would be frustrating.
---
It involves a lot of jerking off?
---
If only nebs knew about that event, maybe 1 of 100 doing it, almost never seen low lvl there. I usually fully mod and give those gear-weapons to fresh players
---
Have you tried rebuilding the database? Instead of repeatedly uninstalling the game
---
is that a thing? who AFK's primal cuts?
---
Shit did I screw it up? I just deleted it and reinstalled it
---
I normally do that with my alt, since I don't care for his play style much. But when I'm close on my main I like to save it haha. Save me a bit of time later, video game time is scares with a 6 month old lol
---
all nut August
---
I have no clue what that even is.
---
Are you sure you can't trade it? Could it be bugged since it was a drop?
---
Is it cool if I take your water?
---
As someone who views humans as prey anyway, the opportunity to hunt them is always rewarding.  It's just a shame Cannibal only works on NPCs.
---
Cool high IQ rick &amp; morty quote, you seem to be in a rush to get your servers bricked.
---
Walk ten feet and travel again , I’d personally prefer they fix real issues like blue screening so bad it’s becoming its own meme
---
I mostly had it happen when I was farming Watoga for legendaries, which was a while ago. I'd kill pretty much every bot in town, then run from tube to tube to spawn more. The death squad had a pretty good chance of a legendary too, so I looked forward to that part.
---
Now I want to try it again, to make sure it still happens.
---
Same!
---
To be fair, have you played Fallout3 or Fallout4? This game takes place before them. It's obvious from those two that rebuilding anything pretty much failed. Nuking the mine is just us helping set up the next games.
---
I was thinking about doing that also - however, do you still get scrip by doing that? I was under the impression that I would need to first collect primal meats before doing the cook out.
---
First time doing meat week.
---
Well it may work it’s different from system to system. If it takes you like a couple of days to install it like me then delete and cancel it and do what I recommended.
---
I like the left drum too.
---
Everyone gets f’ed
---
I just got lvl 100 last night. :/ Wondering what to do now.
---
This is ok I guess. Outside buying ammo, or the occasional rare plan I haven't collected yet, it's becoming more difficult to spend my caps now. The last couple months I been hovering at or close to my cap limit. Once I bought several of the better serum recipes that everyone wants, then selling off my junk in bulk to vendors, I have found it more difficult to spend caps than to earn them.
---
Doesnt appear to be working properly on PC
---
I'd love to charge into a nest full of murderous giant mutated bugs starship troopers style.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCpN2xTMJiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCpN2xTMJiA)
---
Nah, scrip is from doing the Primal Cuts events. I'll be AFK'ing for event rewards and XP. Fingers crossed that the event drops legendaries.
---
A leak from the nearby power plant as an option also.  Maybe they've been shunting wastewater into the mine and you have to drain off the water and seal up the inflow.
---
Or you know, like Lode Baring...just press a button.
---
Now you just have the event pop like Radiation Rumble instead of requiring a silo run.
---
Same reason why shovels are my favorite weapons in farcry 5
---
Hi! It does look like we've had a blip with our social services/friends list, but it isn't related to Meat Week. We're working to correct the issue now, and it should be resolved shortly. 
---
Thanks for the reports, all.
---
It’s fun! Every run so far went off without a hitch and the arena is full of little traps and hazards to keep you on your toes as opposed to SBQ where everyone camps on fences.
---
Did it with a heavy, pistol build and (I shit you not) archer so far and haven’t died or failed the event once yet. None of them were bloodied though.
---
Seen a lot of those going down in there though. The hazards are hella dangerous.
---
Going to be honest, they might as well just make it free to fast travel at this point. We use it that much, and aside from the Ash Heap and the Divide, pretty much everywhere will be cheap to go to.
---
Its expensive to buy the plan with gold bullion and you have to have high enough rep. I think it would take about a month of grinding the dailies to get your rep up, depending on what level it is. The bullion can be gotten in a few weeks if you have the rep (you only need the suit - the helmet functions like a gas mask but doesn't affect the stealth capability). On the other hand, a full set of unyielding and max Agility will give you just as good sneak capability (but no rad defense).
---
How the hell is the radiation emitted supposed to work? I built one because I’m bloodied but it .. breaks itself. And only sometimes do I get the option to turn it off.

A house prefab would be great... BUT they couldn't even get the audio for a bunker door correct or the floor for that matter.
---
So my faith in a decent bigger prefab is a whopping 0.
---
as awesome as it would be
---
Pray for hattermans forgiveness and blessings, his lamp leads us in his light we shine
---
That would drive me nuts. :/ a friend of mine always overencumbers himself and it's painful to wait for him to schlep from the mines to the station after looting mole miners.
---
Having serious FOMO right now 😫😫
---
I shoot my feet. Usually works.
---
I'm not trying to show off, it's not hard to get under the map. Just explaining why
---
Meat Week, farm random encounters, Collosal Problem, farm cobalt flux around nuked Mononga, use the magazine finding perk to complete a magazine collection.
---
Also build a special room for the planetarium. It looks awesome in a small room at night with no windows and the star wallpaper.
---
Enjoy the First month. That's all i'm gonna say
---
Remove any source of health regeneration from your character (armor/mutation/food/chems/whatever) and enjoy *Fast Travel without bugs™*
---
Need some Nuka mines? I have plenty.
---
I tried yesterday and didn’t get anywhere. Went to sleep and tried again today, still no dice.
---
Ok after some digging I finally found where I had seen it, the AMA bethesda did a few months ago, and I may have interpreted it wrong but only 2 things were mentioned about them, 1 said the slots would carry , and the other said "they" would carry over.  
---
&gt;[–]jrg993Bethesda - Dev 557 points 3 months ago 
---
&gt;This summer we’re adding legendary perks into the game. These perks are highly powerful and coveted, and players will unlock new slots to fit them in starting at level 50. You can also scrap all of your extra cards to ranks these perks up, and, when you roll alt characters these slots will be unlocked on them as well.  
---
This comment above sort of implies we get a perk every time we unlock a slot and only levelling them will cost points
---
&gt;[–]jrg993Bethesda - Dev 219 points 3 months ago 
---
&gt;Respecing has been talked about at length and we hope to tackle this in the coming months. **We are adding in Legendary Perks this summer, which transfer across characters** in order to encourage folks to try different builds.

"To sustain yourself and to better your life is a noble, productive, and god blessed goal."
---
lol ok. I'm sure it's very noble and 'god blessed' to hock overpriced garbage for a living. You keep clinging to that idea.
---
So that's what it was?  I was looking through my dailies the other day and saw that I had eaten 1 of 5 pre-war food.  Had no idea what I ate to get that and now after reading this, I realized it was the canned dog food.  Thanks.
---
I missed my window last night on my low level alt. Had a sliver left until level up, but my dang teammate completed a quest and then I was over (didn't even realize I got XP for that, I did see the caps before but never noticed the xp). I was so mad I ran 2 more events to get back close to the next level and then almost overshot it again when clearing mobs so I could fast travel home. Such an odd thing to need to plan around. Lol
---
Griefer = any asshole that follows you from server to server trying to start pvp screaming about how much he hates food builds into his mic

I don't have this problem anymore after I made my boat out in the mire. Can't open doors if there aren't any 😎

I can imagine lol

Mad respect for any wookie that comes out of hiding at the end.   Saves everyone time and frustration.
---
When did you build your camp? The meat week event has been a no build area for at least a few months--maybe since last year.
---
How about the opposite, if it‘s restricted to players which haven’t maxed out reputation. After you reached max. reputation the free travel point will be removed.
---
I may not have been on this subreddit at that time.
---
Chinese stealth armor easy
---
Make 5.56 in the constructor and convert it to 2mm.
---
Is it possible to solo? I'm in my private world with a few workshops going and rather not lose all that work.
---
Or, you can join that world, explore what someone else has done with that space, load up on supplies from their vendor, maybe leave some goodies behind, and then sign out and hop to another server
---
Very first round in the Ash Heap had two people AFK haha I was shocked
---
Came to say this. It will likely help.
---
I've blue screened maybe once in the last month.
---
I support the use of Bushwookie but only when we use it , it’s our word
---
I woke up  with no desire to even bother with the game because Bethesda keeps rehashing old events  like meat week and Fastnacht, endlessly repacking the Scorched Santa event,   and delaying the  hell out of new content.
---
Definitely not in a group. I've played solo since about 2 months from launch and never respond to group/team invites.
---
For me it is delayed
---
Not on 1st so this wasn't it unfortunately.
---
I don't know about the magic shovel, but I do want a weight reduction shovel if you are on XBox.  I'm missing it from my collection.
---
I can trade you an Assassin's shovel for it.
---
If you are going to AFK the primal cuts part you better at least build a camp there that provides some strategic advantage to the active players, even if it is to just throw some turrets to aggro the spawns.
---
Meat week. Every hour on the hour. Plus primal cuts every 15 minutes. Get board of that then go event hop
---
Same thing here
---
You can also log out. LG back in, and Davenport parts you for delivering the goods. I double dip all the time this way.
---
I have two ps4s with one account, will deleting it on one wipe the data on the other?
---
If I'm buying ammo, I'll buy it in three separate transactions, but i will still end up buying more than three rounds.  It just seems like the right thing to do.
---
Sounds like you are just salty. Just block them and move on
---
I’m only a part time Wookie, I move around too much. I probably move at least 15 times over course of a match, not just when I’m outside next ring.
---
Yawn!!!
---
The characters? No.
---
If you don’t have your account linked up to Beth net then idk.
---
Ah ok. I guess I am safe then. This might also explain why some friends weren’t able to build close by
---
I’m on PS4 rn with no isssues, is your internet bugging out?
---
SB kings need to make an appearance, way more violent smaller and faster with crazy poison/rad attacks. Like a 10% chance you get one with every queen and have to kill them both
---
True...but the bos can easily team up with the ss or trade with them or something....and we will get a BOS update... while the only thing we have about the Chinese is the liberators and the deep...
---
Ant Queen as final boss
---
Yes you can, it’s not very hard, it’s just enemies after enemies. It may take some time, but it is soloable
---
I've found a couple... I got excited thinking they had a use too! But sadly I think it's just weirdly specifically named junk.
---
I will just push those far enough out of the area not to receive awards. :D
---
Stabilized helps with auto grenadier accuracy a good deal.  With one gun army, I don't think it's necessary because that weapon staggers and wrecks limbs anyway
---
Is the meat supposed to say primal or not?
---
Good, at least if one screws up I’ll have the other thanks
---
Passed 2 failed one despite killing the lot
---
If they on the drums no pushing for you
---
Of fucking course it does, did we expect better?
---
Mine keeps disconnecting me also
---
So basicly bring survival aka PVP servers back
---
I’m not sure how they work?
---
Tygart Water Treatment, too.
---
"But I think the fact that they're allowed to even announce all this new shit down the theorhetical pipeline is a good sign."
---
Normally I would agree, but as I've already pointed out, last year's roadmap was a near disaster and this year isn't shaping up to be any better. So I don't think that shows anything other than a willingness to overestimate their own abilities and/or mislead their playerbase into a false sense of security. 
---
It really doesn't suggest to me that they're getting any more support from Zenimax, or that that support-- if it exists-- is going to lead to anything good for this game.
---
I don't care about any arguments of whether they put more or less effort into MTX. What I care about is their unwillingness to add interesting new rewards as in-game earnables (especially for camp stuff), while pushing weekly MTX at us. It's pretty clear that these two strategies are linked. 
---
MTX = less baseline content in this case, not more. And that is a very bad thing for this game because it's been struggling to achieve anything like triple-A quality for two years now. 
---
So yea, cosmetic assets are easier to make. The problem is that the vast majority made are for the cash shop or rehashed limited time events, which leads to a boring experience once you've seen the now sparse base in-game offerings, and it means jumping on the 'let's see what costs money this Tuesday' train, where that's the draw of the week, and not the actual game itself. 
---
I was OK with the situation for the first year, but when I saw how badly they continue to drag ass on this, as well as the relentless monetization over the last year (subs, season pass) and the continued poor quality updates, it became obvious to me that this really is a GaaS model that will continue to swirl down the toilet. No developer/publisher should be OK with increasing monetization for a game with as many problems as this one has had, especially since it's a major, beloved IP.
---
So it seems we agree that the game hasn't been doing well, but not that MTX is part of the problem.
---
OMG I didn’t realise it wasn’t just the caps either, team xp is something else I’m going to have to factor in, if that happened to me I’d be mortified lol
---
Lol. It's all about advertising. If you show what the people want, they will come.
---
It’s the gragnak outfit from the atom shop
---
Ya I have 2 PS4 as well. When this happened awhile ago I played on the other while it was downloading.
---
I meant the actual cookout.
---
I know - at least I’d get to decide if the broken-ness was a tolerable quirk or a deal breaker.  And populate the pre-fabs with the usual crafting stations to show how they fit.
---
Not Shocked pikachu face
---
How about a feral ghoul in PA? That would be even better then a scorched, and even creepier.
---
Yes, I mentioned that.
---
I doubt very much lore from 76 is ever going to appear or be referenced in future games. They have not written 76 in a way to be conducive to that. They have written it so that it is closer to equally likely for Appalachia to be a glowing sea region after all the nukes or a thriving society because of the factions, dwellers, and currency 
---
Also, Bethesda just want you to spend as much of your life grinding this game as possible. The silo run is one of the dullest and most time consuming grinds. So they had to make it take an extra step. Like everything else.
---
i swear by my power armor in many situations. always use it in nuke zones and higher level events. the only drawback with mine is that due to my build my armor is all deep pocketed, and once i hop into my excavator armor (calibrated shocks and torso) i loose about 10 lbs carrying capacity but its all good cause it gets through fights like a champ
---
Wait they stack? How many? I have so many i stopped trying to collect the Blooms.
---
Same here, European server.
---
Killed everything, even the last "boss", failed.
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek , I know you guys have loads on your plate, but the event should run smoothly, no?
---
That’s a new one. Will try!
---
Rads out AFK's with environmental damage.
---
We unfriended you for being enclave 🤗
---
Do you have a private world you can join?
---
Supposed to award Primal Cuts on event finishing. But it fails every time.
---
Same
---
Yes, you have to actually do shit
---
Look who doesn't want to gather materials and craft their own chems.
---
I have mostly mediums. A couple large and a couple small. Not sure if there is a limit other than your build budget. Building something in a camp takes away from the budget. Once its used up cant have anything else. Decorations, house, even crops take from the budget..
---
Outside Flatwood on Pc failed as we didnt kill the last wave. Despite there being nothing else to kill. Killed the legendary and then nothing
---
No rate, because the meat has a defined decay timer that can't be stopped by refrigerating. iirc the timer is set to somewhere around 60 minutes.
---
Literally tried this and every other troubleshooting “solution” half a dozen times. The only thing that actually fixes it is deleting and reinstalling.
---
Strong feelings, who are you then BoS? The railroad? Or a....synth
---
Why not with 5? Who in their mind gonna enjoy talking to Ward on all 5 characters
---
Finished fine for me on Xbox right as it first dropped at 4pm. 4 waves, Alpha Sheepsquatch and ended up with 4 prime cuts.
---
Ah, yeah, it's totally fucked then, even when completed got nothing
---
not out yet.
---
Lol of course fireworks have been pulled. Thanks for the work!
---
Chally moo moo is friend. Friend no starve while I here. Chally get ALL the food!
---
Bushwookies 4 life!
---
not cool.
---
I don’t have that luxury, apparently. When it happens on mine, it will keep happening until i delete and reinstall. That is the only thing that seems to fix it.
---
There’s no much unnecessary negativity here. I did do shit. Everyone I was with was doing shit. The event just failed for no reason, as it is for many other people. Thank you for your wholesome input though 🙏🏻
---
Is better and faster close the game
---
The BoS is getting their update. Keep check on the updates scheduled please so you know that it is coming. Besides BoS already gets enough love as is with all their uniforms and armor give other factions some love. Btw the Secret Service has no need for the BoS due to the fact the BoS has no gold and that the Secret Service priority is the defence of the gold.
---
You're right but was it Earle Williams? Or some other giant wendigo.... :-P
---
Haha ghillie suit to brrrrr
---
I swear that’s on the road map
---
Don't they just respawn inside the event area?
---
People have been asking for them since a little after launch. Only way to do it is mods right now.
---
True but it would be a smart move to implement it.
---
The GOP is sabotaging the only profitable Federal system so it can be privatized and "saved".
---
Nope, just public
---
I'm having the same problem.
---
I’m not shitting on anybody who struggles with caps in any way whatsoever because everybody uses them for different things but I feel I spend them quite generously and I’ve never struggled to stay above 20k sense the first time I got above it.
---
I have such a heard time placing prefabs (specifically the red rocket garage) - I can't get far enough away from it to actually see where I'm placing it, and then it doesn't seem to want to place in all sorts of spots it looks like it should. I dunno, maybe I'm doing it wrong.
---
I have finished 3 of them successfully so it is definitely possible
---
Noon for east coast right? 11am for central time?
---
I'm going to have to keep an eye on it as I don't recall it before. It just happened last night so I haven't followed up yet. My alts only level 28 (with full Unyielding) so it doesn't take much xp to move the needle. Could have been something else odd to like my Ally killing something too. I just know if pissed me off since my level 240 main is 95% away from the next level and I hate losing that easy one I wanted to save. Lol.
---
Yeah I really wish that Bethesda would make it a feature.
---
👍🏻 thanks
---
The only reason I lock doors is to keep out critters.
---
Keep your doors locked and and close them yourself after you use them. Or just don’t have any doors for your main house. The only real use for them is to keep our players anyways. I don’t think you hide inside from enemy NPCs
---
Join a nuclear winter match, but hit ESC before it puts you in a team. Then try to find another world again. Usually works for me.
---
The dailys will be reset in like 10min from now
---
I have connected to a switch ( four total emiters ) it blasts me with 120 rads a pop. So I flip it on and off right away take one blast and use the rad barrel for the last bit. 
---
This is only when it works right (80% of the time) other times it just breaks in the loudest fashion possible or doesn't emit radiation. It's definitely not perfect, but what is in this hot mess.
---
It updates in 10 mins.
---
XB1 On private server, got to final boss died several times but eventually had to hard reset since I was stuck dead and pressing A did nothing.  First meet week and didn’t think wud even be live yet so was very unprepared.  Was great up to that point but definitely want to do on public server later after work...
---
Damn, I usually go to my private when stuff starts acting buggy
---
You can move things around and get new cards. I have a bastardized heavy build as I have 7 points in rifles and still have no problems at all with anything
---
Really it comes down to having good guns. I use 50 cals (x3 with bear arms), a handmade as a side and a magic shotgun for up close 
---
I currently have over 80 unclaimed levels at level 170 so you have plenty of room for swapping about
---
It’s not even the normal reset time yet.
---
Yes in the Savage divide. Then tried one in the cranberry bogs that failed because once again all the high level layers spent more time fucking around because they think everyone else is going to do it all.
---
Better than a floater gnasher.  Yeeeowch!
---
Reset has not occurred yet
---
Yes, at reset of dailies so you should t accidentally miss it
---
Why are you talking about decay times when he asked about scrip
---
Nice list! Yeah I have like over 300 Halloween Candy on me for this very reason lol
---
I feel like once you’re max level you don’t have much reason to go back there, aside from the good machines.
---
I was in the savage divide with 4-5 other players who were all contributing and then the event just randomly failed 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Especially if you turn off the lights by destroying their fusion generator.
---
You can respec specials.
---
So basically Fasnacht critter spawn problem all over again?
---
If you are only level 50 then I would stick with the one you have. I would use the Nukes and Dragons build planner to find something think will work. Do you know what weapon/s you want to use?
---
There's six automatic turrets on the roof of my house.  You can leave my door open if you want.
---
I will lead mobs up the hill between events to kill what I can not.
---
Why did you get downvoted for that? I guess common sense gets downvoted here now.
---
Haven’t seen the quest giver yet, but is it possible she’s a descendant of Kim Jong Un?
---
If you get the 1400 a day. It's very easy to stay ahead.
---
Selling Weapons purified water and glowing meat steaks are the easiest for me to gather and sell each day. Takes me like 10 min to get the stuff and sell it.
---
whoops
---
Hmm. I used to find one on the grave right next to it every time I did the quest
---
Wait the fireplace reward is a door??
---
Primal cuts is fucked, stalls then fails for no reason, even completing doesnt give cuts in some events lol
---
Let my explanation marinate for a bit, you'll get it.
---
thankfully 500 gold will get you the plans for legs *and* arms
---
Considering you have to use more durability as well as not having as many people to deal damage, hell yes I am for this.
---
I just hope they add huge spiders... And if they add queen ants, imagine how big and powerful that spider would need to be
---
I would kill for account wide progress especially raiders!
---
Primal cuts is glitched, fails randomly or doesnt reward when completed
---
Because it reputation it something that has to be earned 
---
No other mmorpg allows that.. what they should do add more way to earn them , not make them account wide
---
Caps worthless when youve tor 102838101838 presents.
---
People fear me.
---
No tents here, just hangs then fails, if completed no rewards anyway
---
Yeah but their selfish! So how very dare you!
---
Those don't work on PC anymore.
---
Nice!! I just started playing last month and it took me a while to get used to people shooting at me to get my attention, haha.  One guy shot at me the other day because I was taking too long to read a terminal he wanted to access. 🤣   I dumped a whole bunch of stuff on a level 9 tonight, some first aid and junk and some fun clothing, because I noticed he was at my vendor buying all my junk.  So I was like, dude, have some free stuff!  And other players have done the same for me.  It's great to see everyone having fun and helping each other out! 👍🏼
---

---
I don't know much about junkie builds, but I think you just need a X amount of chems to be addicted. No need for spending points in chem perks(could be wrong).
---
As a new player it probably looks like playing solo make more sense, but since there are public teams it's better going for team. You can still play 'solo' in a team but get benefits from the team, like shared perks, fast travel points and in events you can loot the enemies your teammates killed.  I recommend it(former lone wanderer).
---
V.A.T.S critical shots sound amazing right? But sadly it's not that good.  The 50% extra damage will be calculated from the base damage your weapon do.  So maybe about 50 extra damage. 
---
The only thing for what v.a.t.s critical are good right know are 100% hit chance. When you use concentrated fire you can aim at the head(double damage!).
---
And you may invest in a shotgun that has the second legendary the explosive effect. As a new player you can get sometimes from player vending cheap one. But their primary legendary will be something like hunter or zealot, so not really interested for most players. 
---
I think shotgun are fun weapon, you can hit with it multiply enemies. The strongest point about them you can cripple the lags from enemies very easily. Seeing a crippled deathclaw on the ground is just joy. 
---
I hope I could help you, I wanted you giving a better idea how some mechanics are working so you're not disappointed later. 
---
But remember whatever someone says it could be totally wrong, maybe you create a build that is even better then the meta! But people are restricted in their thinking and believe there is nothing better then the meta. 
---
Spoiler: there are better things ;))
---
And I'm glad I found my special build that nobody has and is extremely strong! 
---
So basically do what you like!
---
here we go again
---
Still could probably sell that to a collector or something. Legendary bear arms are rare, and that’s still a god roll
---
It's not failing for me, because I did something
---
M’kay thanks bud
---
Thus should have been in the game on day one.   Why wouldn’t a game so heavy on inventory management not have a system in place to, well, manage it all?   Baffling.
---
Yeah stabilized and protocols are pretty powerful. It’s an obvious difference, even with a full unyielding sent set you can tank far more damage in PA. The poison resist legendary perk will be sweet.
---
This is great news
---
Nope.  It’s a daily.  
---
I generally do it whenever I go to Crater.  Doesn’t take long.  XP and a few caps.  I forget what the other rewards are.
---
Theres a few critters to kill at the cemetery, so more XP, as well as a variety loot at both the Fort and the cemetery.
---
I think it would be appropriate for people who have achieved max rep with them.  But not before that.
---
This happened to ms a lot building on common locations like Lead deposits near the center of the map. Plan an obscure location, now I never deal with this problem.
---
Those turds left the tenderizer weapon in the drop pool to dilute the odds at the highly preferable plan for it? That's kind of annoying. Looks like I may need to AFK this one to get at least 44 runs in to have decent odds at that stupid 2.27% drop chance.
---
nope. will be coming when they release the hotfix update.
---
If you’re charging more than 1 cap per bullet, I’m leaving aaaaalllllll your doors open and I’m eating your cow.
---
working as intended
---
Just tried to complete one on PC with 4-5 other players who were all actively contributing... the last wave never spawned and the event failed.
---
It might be because of where some fallout first people are putting their tents effecting the spawn locations.
---
That’s exactly what happened to me
---
It shouldn’t cost to travel. I get cap sinks but this does nothing to make the game fun and if a mechanic doesn’t make the game fun it shouldn’t be used
---
Obviously it isn't across the board.
---
Now I'm kinda mad. I'm mad I didn't think of this before now
---
I don’t cheat, but it’s not difficult to understand why they do. It’s the same principle as somebody finding a couple hundreds on the ground of an empty street. You shouldn’t do it, but in the short term you can see the clear benefit and don’t expect any consequences. I can’t hate most of them for doing wha the majority would do, but a very small minority takes it way too far and makes 2 million gifts hoping to get away with it
---
What do you mean "keep check on the updates"?...i literally said that we will get a bos update...i know it's coming...and you never know...the BOS might need some gold from the ss...both the ss and the bos are from the us military...so the might know each other
---
*insert Todd quote here*
---
Don’t kid yourself lol
---
yes
---
I did 4 successfully and then did 1 alone and everything spawned but it wouldn’t complete
---
Yes!   It's fantastic.  :)   But you have to lock it if you want it to stay shut.
---
Sorry, what's BE90?
---
Is Primal Cut supposed to happen every 5-10 minutes? Because that's what it's doing on my server.
---
Exactly: run in, kill Mad dog, done. Easy-peasy.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Bass-playing Russian cosmonaut lady, huh? Not gonna lie, if I were you, I'd ask her for a date.
---
I don’t even care if ACP is broken to start, I just want something to do. The delays without communication or updates are maddening. This damn event is already 2 months late.
---
It’s on the roadmap. 
---
I cant wait for it lol.
---
Max rep level, sure you don't go there as often, but there are several other reputations that it could unlock at, like neighbourly or something. You still have a fairly long grind after that and a free fast travel point will also be used to travel elsewhere, so regardless of whether or not someone has a reason to go to crater or foundation, they would probably still use the free fast travel to get down to watoga cheaper or up to toxic valley etc.
---
It’s a rumor. One of many. The only one that makes the most sense is staggering perks. It stops whatever action it was doing, possibly resetting the landing cycle
---
LOLOL!   Yeah, I should NOT be so nonchalant about a door-opening rabbit.
---
To be fair, they literally did exactly what we asked for in terms of an end game event.  I can’t count how many times I’ve seen threads that say , and I paraphrase, “ how about a new end game boss if we could nuke this place PLzzzz!!!”
---
Is it ridiculous and overkill in terms of role play and story?  Absolutely.  Does it make sense from an end game perspective?  I think so.
---
Bethesda just needs to set the modders loose on this game and let them fix all the issues like that request, we’ve been asking since release and all they do is fuck shit up more whenever they try anything. Let the community that loves this game fix it not some dude in a cubicle who drives home at night excited to play FIFA
---
XB1 :)
---
are you on pc?
---
On the PTS?
---
Yeah, but I don’t want to invest in the commando tree for my BE50 handmade only to discover using an FE90 GP would be more effective.
---
Yeah
---
I don't do doors either.
---
Bethsheda doesn’t actually care about our opinions u/bospaladin77 they just want the green from the update hype. they don’t listen and nothing gets fixed. I left the game when I asked someone on the ama about fixing stability and adding a 1911 9mm pistol and they said “next question please” the next person commented about any other board games and they answered everything. if you want a game to ruin your children’s life and ability to socialize with other kids get them fo76 because nothing says bad parents like “I got my son/ daughter fo76 for Xmas/bday.”  One of my neighbors is dealing with the los of their 9 year old daughter because of this train wreck of a game she was bullied until she eventually killed herself. This game needs to go ASAP or petitions need to be signed to make them fix it.
---
I just scrolled a little through this sub. Seems like this is a problem for many players....
---
No, live
---
I mean yeah, you’d still have those daily quests, but I’m sure the majority, myself included, would be so tired of doing those dailies for rep at that point that they’d just do public events that often give you 2-4 instead of 3
---
Pray for hattermans forgiveness and all will be well
---
I always thought they were lobsters
---
you have to donate it during the Meat Week event (the actual cookout event has to be active).
---
Not really, I have a crossbow I made (lvl 45, I believe) and a silenced combat rifle (level 20 or 30, that someone gave me). I was thinking about a mini gun or gat laser. I've never used heavy guns in a FO game really. But seeing all these ppl in power armor and big guns looks really fun, haha.
---
 I havent even looked into different types of  legendary equipment. I just have legendaries equipped that I found or ppl game me.
---
I just saw it in two different spots over the last half hour.
---
I would like to see some more thrown together shacks, kind of like the ones you see in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.  
---
Also one of my favorite things to use to make a shack, even though it was part of a mod, was using one of the Diamond City buildings.  It was the one that was very open.  Maybe Bethesda could give us something similar?
---
one of her holotapes spawns after nuking a place that is NOT prime.
---
Ive found all of them and the quest is still active for me as well.  Xbox1.
---
You can google the locations.  i believe its 17 holotapes.
---
What is the location of this event?
---
Finally, someone with the guts to move their camp!
---
Thank you for the tag! We will investigate these reports.
---
Republican Party has been trying to kill/hobble USPS for a long time for a ton of political/financial reasons. Now, with COVID in an election year, a lot of states want to do mail in ballots. USPS was due for massive cutbacks this year because Republicans control the White House/executive branch (they are now delaying further cuts until after the election due to accusations of trying to rig the election, see below). USPS is headed by a Trump loyalist that proposed the cuts and started removing mail collection boxes, particularly in black neighborhoods. They also basically said that if states do vote by mail the USPS can't guarantee adequate delivery capacity. Trying to scare states into not doing vote by mail or making it so that come November we have a mess that calls the results into question or delays them, giving Trump a window to contest the results by screaming about fraud, etc (no evidence, zero expert support for the idea that vote by mail causes fraud). 
---
Here's the kicker. Democrats tend to do better when there is higher turnout. Having vote by mail would make it easier for everyone to vote, driving up turnout. It also makes it more possible for people more likely to vote for Biden to vote (low wage workers, the most vulnerable elderly, minorities etc). So what basically became apparent was that the Trump admin was trying to intentionally hobble the USPS to affect the outcome of the presidential race. 
---
So some folks (like OP) have tried thinking of ways to fix this by helping the USPS. It isn't about sticking it to Trump, it's about making sure we can have a fair election without having to go to petri dish polling places and catch COVID. 
---
SOURCE: I don't feel like linking news articles, not hard to find. Also, I'm a dissertation away from a doctorate in Political Science. And no, I didn't even pretend to be impartial on this because it's pretty obvious what's happening. The admin isn't even trying to hide it.
---
The bear arm?  Project paradise,  gotta keep all animals alive as far as I understand.  That's how I got my first bear arm.  To get legendary drops I believe you need the PLAN which is also obtained through P.P.
---
I mean, it does say "Try to find a new world." Doesn't say anything about succeeding.
---
The funniest thing to me is those Brotherhood nerds are walking across the full expanse of the country only to settle into a location that's within spitting distance of a mine that's going to get nuked every hour every day.
---
Strange! It has worked for 2 years straight and now its bugged. Surprisingly not surprised
---
Last time I accidentally 60 dollars’ worth of hot sauce from some dudes IRL company. Package arrived a few days later and it took me half a day to figure out where it came from. Haven’t drank since.
---
I think it has to do with fps or something odd. Sometimes mine melts (stalkers/limb/rw mini w/o accel barrel full health). Sometimes It melts, then stops, then melts again. Sometimes it stays less magic. I like it without the accel barrel, get more distance and still get the bonus.
---
On Earl, I melted him from under his base shooting up once. His foot is no joke, stepped on me at half health and I went strait to respawn. Always over encumbered so ended up sat in the cave like a luffagus. The only time I've died at the event.
---
Anymore I cripple him with tormentor/grenadier and stay away from his feet, do the mini because it saves ammo either way. If there's a king dingaling, it saves the 5mm. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Re2nDtZiOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Re2nDtZiOI)

 &gt; Thank you for the tag! We will investigate these reports.
---
It's not a stupid question, it's never stupid to ask a question. Those that don't ask questions remain unenlightened. Those that call a question dumb are only showing their level of intelligence and education. Their lack of understanding makes them dumb and ignorant.
---
Heavy gunner and melee benefit from high strength.  Rifles benefit from high perception.
---
if you normally play solo, loner wanderer
---
Must have perks: starched genes, class freak.
---
Better farming flux and plants : GreenThumb
---
higher damage against glowing enemies : glowsight
---
Marsupial and speed demon mutations are pretty much givens for any build.  Consider healing factor and adrenal reaction.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Dr. Zorba hahahahaha
---
Does the exp increase with each lvl ?!? I tho it was capped
---
Edit: I used to make a new character for this daily but now for me it seem faster to me to server hop and do line in the sand/ radiation rumble /scorched queen
---
The game is so much more enjoyable when youre new. I still have fun with it now but its a different kind of fun
---
That's good to know. Yeah I have a semi stealth rifle user with a lot of survival perk cards (less hungry/thirsty and weight reduction).
---
Yeah the downvotes are real,  the man has every right to be mad and impatient.  This is the second delay and Bethesda has had a very bad history with things like this.  I’m alright waiting like I’m sure some others are but I understand his frustration and I know he is definitely not alone in his sentiment.  Downvote this,  you’d only be downvoting facts.
---
Sorry I thought you meant that you thought there would eventually be a BoS update. On the other hand the Secret Service doesn't hand out gold. they give it out for hard work or helping them. The chances of the BoS and Secret Service knowing each other is around 1% these are 2 different factions with different goals from a crossed the country. They do not know each other. Besides BoS is bringing their own new armor.
---
Prefabs are tough because they are going to show them somewhere perfectly flat that doesn't indicate how impossible they are to place most of the time.
---
That is great news.
---
No they have to press A button to respawn and if they don’t before the events over they don’t get the reward
---
Ahh makes sense about the VATS. Maybe they’ll buff it one day.  At least shotguns are easy to use without it
---
I’ll see what adjustments make sense then! The plan was to fill out the build, but make changes as I figure out what I like and dislike. 
---
From the perspective of a new player (I played in beta, but gave up with rampant bugs and DCS), that’s a drawback for me. It’s so hard to plan long-term when I barely have any idea of what the late game will be like. But I also have to, otherwise I’ll end up super inefficient. 
---
I’m not even trying to min/max here. I just want to end up with a useable character! 
---
Once I figure out the mechanics of perk cards, I’ll add those to my randomizer I’m making. I think I’ll enjoy the challenge of adapting my play style as that build progresses.
---
The levels were fairly easy to figure out - I bias each Special level to levels already obtained. That way, you’re almost guaranteed to end up with 1 or 2 maxed by 50. 
---
The cards will be tougher to distribute in a way that feels random, but doesn’t pile you with useless perks.
---
LOL!
---
Most of the people that actually grief others don't want people that can fight back as targets. I personally enjoy chasing griefers off servers but they aren't all that common on PC anymore. Also what people consider griefing varies quite a bit.
---
I know u didnt give me the answer i was looking for but u gave me a better view for myself thank you my fellow redditor i hope u have a good day
---
Whaaaaat?!?!
---
Mine never got deleted per say but it ended up saved as a blueprint that I couldn’t set down in the original spot
---
Occasional one works ok, but that's 1 out of 5 for me
---
Yeah I’m trying to server hop to find a successful event but they have all failed.
---
You'll only lose your original CAMP location if you place your CAMP in a new location in the new world.
---
I played wow for 15 years, i know what that means. Rep gains in fo76 created in a lazy and shit way, 3 dailys for tiny rep gain, just encouraging you to log every day, another mobile crap from bethesda, with other daily limits like caps or scrip. Its not an accomplishment , its a crap with shitty timegates. Same with recipes, not being account wide
---
Same on mine
---
Seemed different to me too
---
I thought I read that somebody had mentioned not as of yet. it's supposed to be coming with some sort of a hot fix whenever.
---
I primed mine, all heavy gunner perks, bloody mess, nerd rage, tenderizer 1, psychobuff or psychotats, and emergeny protocoled Power Armor is all I ever needed.  You just have to keep shooting at the same limb.  Full effect is best demonstrated on the head.
---
I had round about 10 people there running around. Event failed. Event started again and failed instand again. I love Bethesda. I really love them.
---
Mine failed
---
I hope my shitty graphic helps: [https://i.imgur.com/owuXI0p.png](https://i.imgur.com/owuXI0p.png)   
---
Is that value on your machine notably low?  
---
I would also perhaps suggest upping it to a larger value than "system managed" would normally assign. My 76 *never* crashed since I applied that change. (I know, could be coincidence, but still)
---
to be fair, the week just started, and a lot of us are at work.
---
Actrully it was from the atlas donation thing so it’s not specifically for making up to those people affected.
---
No event for me either.  I don't even know where to look
---
I liked the old voice better then the new one
---
wahhhhhhh
---
I have marsupial mutation w/ starch genes and class freak. That was one of the only things I planned on after I got the mutation randomly, twice, l at a very low level and was bummed when I cured it each time. And I have a maxed lone wanderer but I do join public groups mostly so it doesn't get used much, but I'll be doing story stuff solo so it'll be good then.
---
I'm on a good server here had it done in just over a minute if on xbox feel free to join
---
Thx m8 its apreciated
---
  With the right group, you can probably gain a level every time you do RR.  Build team with everyone bound gives 4x bonus.  Prior to going in, everyone open a lunchbox.  Optionally, consume brain fungus soup and/or cranberry relish.  You end up with a 100% XP bonus.  At 229, gained a full level and 1/2 of another at the last RR we did.
---
Yeah. It can happen every 15 minutes in each of the map zones so it's less than 15 if you go between zones.
---
I mean, by the time I loaded outside the mine, the power armored player group who were chatting when I first lined up for the event had completed the event and fast traveled out. I didn't even CTD, just died and reloaded, about 5 seconds.
---
I want something like this to turn off my rad shower.
---
Yep all mine already complete besides scrap armor and survive nw for 15
---
Near vault 76
---
Dangit!! I love meat week and been looking forward to it. Hope Beth does something to make it right
---
Still broken. This still helped! Legenda
---
Yeah I am not even gonna bother with this broken event..
---
Full server turned up on mine
---
oh ok never mind. thought it was out on xbox
---
You didn't get a Public Event notice?
---
Im in the same boat. The past few days ive been about to level up and stop playing its annoying. I sat out a queen fight for this very reason the other night.
---
Good times. It was like this last time though. Eventually people catch on.
---
Never
---
What’s your gamer tag?
---
That would be asking far too much
---
Just failed the bbq for some reason
---
Nothing  event failed
---
So you know the deal 
---
Wow didn’t make rep account wide so why should Bethesda?
---
I think it be better if they add more daily quest to earn rep. If it was up to me it be 5 daily quest per rep , and reward rep on daily ops too
---
Why would they start now?
---
Jep, I was 1 min late and it failed 10 sec after I joined. Just quit out of the Game. Better luck next hour;)
---
Not sure why he was getting downvoted, people are looking at this in the wrong light.
---
I have hundreds of hours in NV on console.  Finally got a decent computer, so I bought it on Steam.  First thing I did was download all the mods I wanted because I had already played it.   Never even opened it unmodded on pc.   And when I game I like goes on sale, I go ahead and buy it on PC because well it is cheap.  I do the same with those.  Try it out on console (Gamepass helps), then do what i want on PC.  I know I'm nowhere near a majority, but there are definitely other fringe players like me that play on both systems.  Whether it is because your friends play on console and not PC, because you're rig blew out and need to save for a replacement, etc... there are a number of reasons.  
---
  Although now I've upgraded to a halfway decent computer, once I get a monitor not too sure I will be doing this in the future.
---
Have it. Didn't help xD. My own fault, don't get me wrong, I should have looked, but I made a silly assumption encouraged by what most games do, and figured I would comment here to forewarn others of the same.
---
Lowlifescarab86 but I'm showing offline give me yours I'll invite you in
---
Ballistic Bock overdrive psychotats and bobble head small guns
---
Some guns are less consistent, and it is tied to FPS.  My B LD Minigun worked constantly for me at like 30-40 FPS where I sit at normally.  The B 33 One I have is inconsistent,  some servers it shreks,  other times it feels like I’m using a one star bloodied mini.  IDK
---
I’m getting this problem too, it seems to happen on PC (Xbox) game pass and not via the Bethesda launcher.
---
God you live a sad existence if you care that much.
---
True..but I'm just saying the possibilities cause i really want a BOS mod or paint for the ss xD...even if it's an atomic shop item...i want to have my jetpack but i also want to role play as a BOS member... :/... unless if the BOS will bring a new type of armor that also has a jetpack
---
I understand but the whole server was at each Primal cuts event leading up to it
---
balancedflame79
---
The cookout itself is by Vault 76.   The hunts for primal meats are all over the place.
---
Some people never played minecraft and it shows
---
There is a max of 8 people that can be there before there is a second instance made i think. So if there were 8 people already you get put in a new/second group/instance
---
You can add me on pc. IGN Curie-X81
---
Will be on later today
---
imagine using bitch boy unironically like and internet tough guy
---
Happened yesterday And today to me. 6/9 completed yesterday and 7/9 completed today. Extremely discouraging.
---
Everybody hopped off before the score reset and missed the first meat week.
---
Thanks i never done this event before
---
...There's a .308 reciever for the LMG...? Not dissing, but what's the point when you get .50 reciever by default? .50 rounds are more powerful and easier to come by via the Ammosmith and Super Duper perks?
---
They are......someday
---
At the center of the cookout area there is a grill.  You can add meat to it once the event timer starts.  You get scrip for each piece you add at the end of the event unless it fails.  
---
Slap meat on the grill right away and then start doing the event
---
Bloodied, Explosive, 90% reduced weight.  Basically, a near impossible god roll.
---
then WTF
---
They Reset but only three unchecked ones shoed up for me.
---
I've seen enemies wander pretty far away. I've heard survival tents may be messing up spawns.
---
It is essentially being killed by Trump's newly-appointed head. It's causing many problems, including:

I did one at 11 and another 11:30.   Both were fine.    
---
I hate inconsistency.
---
God you live a sad existence if you care enough to reply.
---
Are you in the enclave?
---
It's so annoying when people leave the rad shower on aswell
---
aaaaand its bugged!
---
So they did Reset but only 2 show up on one account and three on the other platform.
---
Gf and have gotten booted several times in a row from server disconnects. Five for her. Six for me. So much for meat week..
---
Yeah, it does. I finished it on private server, no issue.
---
I do recall it happening atleast ones. To be fair i might have been dreaming
---
Sure. But it'll brake in following patch.
---
I gave it time and only three reset.
---
Please &amp; Thank you.
---
While you are at it, the cookout should also start on the hour, every hour, yet it doesn't :/
---
I ate today, so there must be no more global
---
hunger.
---
Gotcha. 
---
I missed Meat Week last year so I thought the Primal Cuts event was bigger than it actually is. Makes sense that it happens so often.
---
PA has a lot of utility and hidden attributes that people don't often realize. It's also more durable than regular armor. If you aren't sneaking or using a vats build then PA is pretty good.
---
Literally a bunch of people use the same build as me i just got lucky with her landing and used chems so stop  crying  about your food build
---
I'm wondering if the event is "broken," or if people don't realize what they're supposed to be doing. 
---
50/50 shot, these days.
---
.308 hits harder than .50 on the LMG??? That may be the case but realistically that sounds entirely wrong.
---
Oh wait I'm dumb, I got the LMG and the MG mixed up into the same gun. 🤦‍♂️
---
They should really just put a static asset of a shovel stuck into the dirt pile that you just click on. Having to find and equip one is a little tedious.
---
And for the second day in a row the dailies auto complete and give me no score.
---
I just make a new character for the leveling. By the time I get to the wayward I already finish the weekly level up challenge
---
I think reset occured but only three showed up and two on PS4
---
Tenderizer plan, had to server hop to find a good cookout.
---
Exactly! Lol!
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Just wait until you hit stash limit, it'll become significantly less fun.
---
Thank you. Looking at your build I can see how I am squishier than you are. I am missing some of the perks (blocker in a standout example), and I am certain my DR is lower than yours, as I was late to the Bloody party and my gear is much more modest. That said, I can also see you've got the commando/VATS variant of bloody, which is so far as I have heard possibly the only bloody build that is not hot garbage. I'm going to go tinker later and see if commando works better at stopping them before they murder me.
---
Yah tried that out last night, great advice!  Saved me a load of time
---
Was there a fallout first tent there?
---
Good thing I'm on PS4 and they still do.
---
That's not what kept it from putting your camp there. I had my camp on a fixed enemy spawn for over a year and there were 6 scorched in my camp every time I'd log in.
---
Camps have a no build area around them that's about three times larger than the build area. If your camp overlaps another camp's no build circle then it won't allow it to place.
---
There was just probably a very small camp placed somewhere you didn't notice. Maybe someone dropped their camp without building anything yet.
---
Also tents used to be able to block camp spots, not sure if they still can.
---
Reset happen for me just like it always does at 1200 est. No auto completes no issue
---
Yeah I hope they give away his apparel. It would be great to Role play.
---
They most likely will have access to jetpacks due to the fact of the fan base. (No offense for what I'm about to say) But the BoS is such and over done concept I hope they honestly don't play such a big role in the future.
---
Well, of course you're not the only one, no idea why you'd think that. 
---
For some of us, the game works properly and is a lot of fun to play. For others, their game doesn't work for whatever reason. Obviously most people prefer to come on here and complain, so the opinions are going to be a little skewed.
---
Mine too, almost missed putting the meat in as I was smoking when it started. Took a hole 7 minutes to finish.
---
Sure, ign is same
---
No I just have a bloodied insta sledge that oneshots everything aside bosses.
---
The event will keep popping up, not the end of the world. Pretty good xp and drops. You can't just sit on your butt. Have to move around an kill the mobs on mini map.
---
Bloody chefs outfit.
---
Edit, went to look at plans, got a beer stein display and meat week beer stein
---
Game devs deal w/ one of the most difficult coding; maybe they just lack talent.
---
PTS helps, but when a new patch actually goes live to the thousands of online players, this just creates new bugs. Luckily, they have been quick to hotfix them e.g. colossal problem fast travel to event bug where it disconnects you was fixed immediately after being reported
---
Probably because a kids camp was there it just happened to me
---
Happened to me. All were completed except 3.
---
I was
---
Poison damage is no joke.
---
Are they auto completed or just not reset?
---
Lmao 😄
---
I hope they will have jetpacks...also i don't like what you're saying but I'm not triggered..xD
---
I was considering melee, but melee is absolutely trash for PvP. So I’ll make a melee character too. What’s better in your opinion - unarmed or two handed?
---
Also please turn off my rad shower.
---
Yeah I think the drop rate was datamined to be 5% or something, still unlucky to not get it after so many tries though. Hope your luck improves!
---

---
This is what he is talking about.  Does a great job of explaining it.
---
Who isn't nowadays?
---
A loud of rubbish that doesn't make sense in my opinion, from what I gathered it's to do with the latency of the server, if the latency isn't great(tiny not of lag) it looks like the enemies health goes down quicker, but hey that's my IMO.
---
I understand I wish their role would be like the Mojave one so new factions get a chance at the spotlight.
---
Their camp, their rules. You're entitled to nothing
---
Check out angry turtle’s latest video on his sneak build that just melted colossus
---
Been checking for update every half hour on my PS4. Just come on Bethesda? Not even a release date or time, on top of the endless delays there's been for this event over the past how many months.  It almost assures me I won't be missing much as a veteran player who will be quitting when patch 22 releases.
---
Today was the first day for the double rewards.... it was also the first day 9 out of 10 dailies auto-completed for me (and my roommate)
---
Bethesda Giveth, Bethesda Taketh Away
---
Oh okay thanks. 
---
Sounds like something I wouldn’t like to use lol. 
---
But thanks anyways!
---
People lock doors?
---
In the pot at the meat event
---
What does the backpack look like?
---
Ah okay. Roger that. Thanks!
---
In the big Super Mutant cooking pot near the roasting Yao Guai, or at least this is how it was last year
---
all but 7 for me, the perk couns are the really inly glaribg issue
---
Stay out of my fridge
---
Thanks a lot for the link and help!
---
3 sets of 5, so max 15 primal cuts = 15 scrip per cookout
---
Haha Nice!
---
Look up angry turtle magic weapons on YouTube.  He gives a great explanation and even provides testing to demonstrate.
---
Secret Service would be connected to the Enclave. BoS would probably just want to steal the gold and tech from them.
---
All the time
---
Thanks for resolving this. My friends are ‘Offline’ when playing via the PC (Xbox game pass), but not when starting via Bethesda Launcher.
---
On the Yao guia roast
---
Not read the plan yet waiting tonsee how rare some of these drops are
---
It’s not working
---
Sounds like something I wouldn’t like to use either lol. 
---
But thanks! At least now I know what it is people are referring to
---
Lol legend post
---
This. No point in being in a rush to leave for some ores near the exit. Usually the wendigos keep spawning for sweet exp
---
They best be gettin them stitches
---
Yeah that you have to be Lucky more people join. I think you got unlucky and people didnt:(
---
If you dont have at least 1 workbench and stash outside im entitled to go "wow what an asshole"
---
Yea I was looking for a post about if the meat week was glitched because i did the event like 7 times and have not got anything but meat.
---
Thanks imma go do that!
---
I don't think so... they're both from the us military
---
Oi.  I really wanted to get this but I think I’ll wait for the BoS Bunker from Season 2.
---
So...does nuking camps because you don't like the decor fall under gweefing then? Or is that okay? ;-)
---
Someone used one at the SBQ and we killed it before it could even mutate
---
Most of them look like yesterdays Except for Nuclear Winter. Yesterday's was Pick a Lock(1/1) todays is Survive for Minutes (15/15)
---
 haven't played nuclear winter yet.
---
Has nothing to do with server lag. Its a glitched gun, that for whatever reason, allows you to have unlimited range with a shotgun, or triple damage on an explosive weapon, or a stack of perks just right that changed the damage of any gun outside of its intended nerf.
---
It caps at level 1000.
---
Aww :( alright. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Place on top of a framed picture does work.  Thanks
---
I can’t interact with it
---
Yeah, some form of addiction where they have to be at the top or nothing.
---
Yeah i understand that
---
TL;DR SJW troll post.
---
I buy them. When I kill a player I leave one in their loot bag.
---
I just encountered that. That’s why I got curious of what the hell was going on. 
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
You clearly dont read what i say, and why i said it, there should be no timegating on rep at all, or very small of it
---
I think there are a lot of people from WV who would not agree with your characterization of them. 
---
Also this is a fictional version of the state. Different universe. Different politics.
---
Look up photo glitch on YouTube. Locked doors will never be a problem untill instance interior bases.
---
No problem. Not 100% sure to be honest tho, but that is what I read on other posts
---
There was no other camp or survival tent anywhere around. It’s a flat area you can see a good distance. It was just the mole rats.
---
What lvl are you and how much exp it takes
---
This is why my camp is themed after a small shop.  I dont mind if my doors are left open, and as an added bonus, all my benches are outside.
---
is the event active
---
Photo mode glitch is your friend. I always leave something so they know they're not safe
---
I have a dense torso mod, no sweat
---
There's been plenty of tactical outfits added
---
I just learned about these last night because apparently I have one, and have been using it for a while! 
---
It’s a 3* pump shotty w/bashing, and apparently that combo lets me 1-3-shot high level glowing ghouls. I didn’t get why, but didn’t want to jinx it with asking hahaha
---
I ended up with two explosive shotguns yesterday, and couldn’t figure out why, with higher dmg, they weren’t coming close to my first. So finally asked. Magic was the answer.
---
And yes, I’m sure many have been turned in for scrip before now by those of us who had no clue 🤷🏼‍♀️ You’re not alone there!
---
Sounds like something Beth wouldn’t approve of at all. Imma stay clear of that path lol. 
---
But thanks for the info!
---
Did you collect the last holotape from that robot down @ the entrance of vault 76? It took me a while to find that one out.
---
Time gated grind and rep being account wide is 2 different things
---
First time I've got the bug was today, and my partner did too. Ridiculous.
---
PA is not underpowered, it's misunderstood how to be used effectively.
---
Heavy gun + PA + Bloodied + Emergency Protocols + Stabilized + Heavy Gunner Perks + Bloodied perks = everything dies (except for you).  Once Legendary Perks plugs the poison DOT, I will fear nothing in the wasteland.
---
I am on PC so I can't really help. I have gotten several gatling plasmas from scorchbeasts during the queen fight but they aren't all that common. If you do end up buying the plan make sure you craft the lowest level, use super duper and scrapper.
---
I literally just came on to ask this question lol.
---
K.  You pretty much have to determine what weapons class you want to run and move your perks around/gain mutations to suit.  
---
Stabilized3 will benefit your heavy guns (AGI, I think)
---
Motion assist servos on your PA torso gives +2 STR.
---
Be aware some mutations will negatively affect certain weapons.  
---
Ex:  grounded negatively affects energy weapons, electrically charged boosts them, but can draw you into PvP if you dont have pacifist on,  twisted muscles boosts melee damage but decreases ballistics accuracy, et al.  class freak goes a long way in offsetting the negatives
---
  I started as a melee/sniper, so invested heavily in STR and PER.  Still run mainly melee, but switch to heavies for certain critters.  
---
High PER give me the option to snipe if I need/want - very useful for defending workshops from outside the PvP zone.  
---
Downside is with most of my perks in 2 columns, I’m short on luck (4) and charisma (3).
---
Also they each are at 500 S.C.O.R.E. instead of 250.
---
Oh see this was why I was asking. 
---
I probably wouldn’t even notice I had them either(if I do) lol.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
lol glad i’m not the only one
---
Are you saying your friends are gweefer assholes? Because that's the only way someone is going to follow you from server to server. You can always block people.
---
The event has to be active. Every hour on the hour
---
Did you play during the reset? If so you got hit by the auto complete bug truck. Make sure next time to stay at the main menu while the dailys reset that will save you for the bug.
---
To be fair my camp has no vending machines so nobody should be at my camp but me. There for only I need access to my benches
---
Yeah same for me
---
Seems like a massive overreaction, but if that's how you roll, cool.
---
... what? how does that make anyone harder to get caught? just speaking from experience here, some people are simply generous and your assumption is very wrong and doesn‘t make much sense.
---
I wonder if maybe the server didn't remove the reservation from a previous camp that left the server.   I've tried building in some locations before and found a no build circle that had no camp in it anymore, just drop bags from whoever was there.
---
I have seen posts for it being every 15 mins but don't know if that is true.
---
jesus i dont even those this shits probably gonna get postponed like fasnacht did like 3/4 of everyone ive taked to had it fail immediately after starting
---
Meat week being glitched is all anyone is posting about right now. Try sorting the sub by "new" if you haven't already. It is actually pretty useful.
---
Yes, it's still a thing. Never stopped.
---
Do we even need prime meat? Can’t we just play the drums and turn the spits and still get to the max rewards?
---
Kill enemy's, get meat, go to cookout every hour near vault 76, profit.
---
that would be pretty interesting
---
Its rewarded upon completion, if the event doesnt random fail as it seems to do
---
thanks for the fast reply!
---
Yes it's still there, not fixed.
---
Wow....and dude, the lore is Vault 76 was built in West Virginia.
---
Shovels are underrated. I miss the ones in far cry 5 which you could throw and blow up planes with
---
It’s has never been fully fixed.  That fix is kinda like the deep pocketed SS plans being put on the game:  it didn’t actually happen.
---
Best advice is still to not be logged in 15 mins on either side of the reset, and if you played NW to end your session, login with that character to adventure before the reset.
---
Hey are you Big Hacker on discord?
---
What level are you in the run?
---
Id be happy if mini nukes were half that effective in 76
---
&gt;Anyone else think it would be cool?
---
Bethesda does, because they are adding it [Winter 2020](https://fallout.bethesda.net/de/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons).
---
I'm having the same issue. Can't even join friends directly.
---
I got nothing just meat.
---
They changed his voice awhile back
---
thanks!
---
that happened to me my first time i did it
---
Oh mines has fixed itself
---
Some opinions should just be kept to ourselves.im just a small minded tx boy that doesn't like politics in my video games.
---
Are you doing the meat week event or just primal cuts events
---
Bonus Challenge Week: From August 26 – 31, we’re adding a few Daily and Weekly Challenges to your usual lineup, which means even more opportunities to rake in extra S.C.O.R.E. each day.
---
Nice.
---
See now that I watched the video i just found out I’ve been running with a magic weapon for all this time. Who could’ve known man 😂
---
What system?
---
And you know this isnt real. Or based on our America. Don't play it if you dont want to.
---
Actually, I was speaking about the hotfix which was delivered to PC's on Tuesday, which turned on "A Colossal Problem" &amp; added the desperately needed Deep Pocket mods for SS Armor.
---
Regarding PTS participation, token camp item is OK for some. Free Atoms would be better. If you're serious about wanting more play testers, that's the way to do it.
---
Ps4, I don't know how
---
When i had all my doors locked was because i didnt want folks coming there. Folks leave doors open all the time.
---
Throwing away XP, but OK then. And they’ll probably be on Reddit later today moaning about how hard it is to level up for daily SCORE.
---
By default my was just south of 5 GB
---
I have increased this by 10x
---
Edit: putting my 4TB of storage to work
---
Nope. Had the same issue on two different consoles. Literally every single other game i play has zero or minimal issues, both online and offline.
---
So, AFKers: drumm or spin the meats, please!
---
If you reached a level higher than 50 you probably have enough caps that it is no big deal, but to be honest, I always fast travel over vault 76, my camp or camps of people I am in a team with to save some caps... It's just annoying and does not make too much sense.
---
I guess that it was meant to force beginners to explore Appalachia because it would be too expensive to use fast travel all the time.
---
During the first Meat Week you placed it directly on the cookfires, did this change in subsequent releases?  I'm seeing barrel donations or turn into Graham, where does the meat go? (Phrasing...)
---
I was surprised it failed to be honest. There were only about 4 of us, but I've seen i completed with that many before. 
---
Oh well, I just swap servers and try again.
---
This is funny. I get upset about the same thing lol xDhate finding dead radstag all over the floor when I get back lol. I make a habit of closing peoples doors when I leave. I was thinking of doing the automatic pressure plate door things so it will always be closed unless you’re standing on the button.
---
Can you save the radkelp, fragrant venison, etc for the next event? Might be worth doing the event solo, gathering as much of the stuff as you can for all three critters, then next time people actually come to participate dumping it all at once for a chance at maximum rewards.
---
I don’t way past  50 I spend my caps on things I need or want lol
---
Well the next legendary run is military stuff but idk if anything fits the tacticool build. There are some combos now with the insurgent gear, scout outfit and armor and first gives you the bog outfit which pairs well with a treasure hunter hat for that COD look also the ranger helmet works with exposed armor.
---
what is the diffrence? I forgot about meat week last year
---
Alright! Thanks for your help.
---
Yep, a massive bug too. They're too incompetent to figure out the problem
---
I lock my doors but not to spite people, it's only just to stop enemies from walking in and attacking my generator and rad shower. Otherwise I'd leave it open for people to check out and use my benches etc. 
---
Not that it always works anyway as occasionally they just appear inside despite my camp not being on a spawn point.
---
Oh I'm aware, I'm just making a point that they are trying to get more people to get involved. Yet they won't activate the PTS for consoles, which per their own admission is the biggest population for the game
---
I’ve never seen so many people actually just afk lol
---
I've tried but it doesn't work. Somehow this one got bugged and lost its quest item flag.
---
Same here. 7/9
---
You have to collect prime meat from primal cut events then take it to the meat week event on the hour near vault 76
---
AH! Okay, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for your clarification.
---
I’ll second this- my husband and I have not encountered most of the problems others users have, and we’re on for at least a quick run almost daily. 
---
That said, I sympathize heavily for others who want a good experience and don’t get it because of these problems...of course that wouldn’t be fun for any gamer to deal with. 
---
This is the only PS4 game I own (husband made me go buy my own console when it was released just so I could play hahaha)...before this was NES, GC, and my trusty Master System (if you don’t know what that gem is, look it up)...games aren’t really my thing and haven’t been for about 15 years, but FO76 has been a great experience for me personally so far- sorry you (op) and others aren’t having the same fun.
---
Yeah theybseem to not be able to fix the auto complete bug happened to me first time today for the double score
---
Its random when they spawn. There are farming routes on YouTube to kinda guide you. Some events are guaranteed to have legendary mobs like the leader of the pack.
---
you the man, thank you!
---
Log out before the reset then log back in to avoid this issue
---
It's a very annoying bug, the dailies auto completed before you could finish them, giving you no SCORE for today
---
Are they not updating, or are they updating but being auto-completed?
---
Contact support then.
---
I'm only going off what limited info you gave and what i know as someone who works with electronics.
---
Seems a fairly unique to you problem.
---
Same thing in the Savage Divide. Events failing left and right because spawns are too slow and too far away.
---
For killing glowing enemies or cryptids, Hemlock Holes usually has a bunch of glowing radroaches and guaranteed spawns for 2 snallygasters and 1 grafton monster.
---
The sheer number of radroaches around makes it pretty good for "kill creatures", and you can grab the workshop while you are there, defending it to get an event completion.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ONfnoj0Ui3AmUEwBF0wFp/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-activities-in-appalachia
---
Yeah it is very annoying if it was one 1 day i wouldnt mind it that bad but if this continues im gonna be a little frustrated bc those 2 days are kinda crucial at this point
---
You should have joined a friend in another world. After it does it to me I join a friend and idk seems to put me in a different server list or something. We have to assume its putting us in servers meant for a local area( like state or time zone) to keep latency down.
---
Will do thanks!
---
good to know.I'll spend some time reorganising the vendor
---
As stated in the document if you afk be less of a derp and get on a spit or drum. This event you can actually help by afking. I be doing the same with two accts simultaneously; one afk one playing.
---
Yeah, from what I have seen, gaming communities are generally opposed to intrusive anti-cheat that scans your entire computer or anything running outside of the game. It's one thing if you have cheat engine open and connected to the game, another if you have python open for a work project
---
I have them in hopes that Gramps will go deal with the problem And, I won't be annoyed by pesky bullets. He usually fails just like the turrets though. I still hope one day he won't
---
They are updating being auto-completed. Only 2 daily’s i can do the nw and 1 random
---
Damn. That is unfortunate. It probably lost quest flag when somebody forgot to deposit it and either completed or failed the mission. I've gotten the ingredients for the canned stew event at mama dolce's left in my inventory a few times this way.
---
You are in fact entitles to nothing. You arent special and they dont owe you anything.
---
Thanks im going to try this tomorrow!
---
It's so lazy of a plot I literally cannot make myself go thru a silo to even do it.
---
Yeah i know its a real bummer :/
---
oh ok
---
I would just bank up perk points and try out different weapons. Heavy weapons are fun but like anything automatic you will have to farm ammo. Gatling laser and plasmas are popular because cores are easy enough to get. Do events and if you get a weapon try it for a bit.
---
True, but at least I’ll be able to walk through it a get a feel for the size... I manage pretty well with my greenhouse dome. Maybe the thickness of the foundation helps
---
oh really? I didn't know they fixed it so i can do 2 sided walls again?
---
The camper is my go-to prefab.
---
The difference remains unchanged, it's the buffs from perk cards etc that are effected
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcq6o/meat\_week\_2020\_reward\_list\_datamined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcq6o/meat_week_2020_reward_list_datamined/) 
---
Next time use search option
---
u/valseek u/ladydevann just to be sure....
---
Agreed to that.
---
only if we have a mini-nuke ... oh wait..
---
That thing gave me nightmares, but I’d love to fight another one
---
"I was just waiting in-game for the daily SCORE challenges to refresh."
---
That's the most likely cause of this bug.
---
I'd guess Furious, but Bloodied or Junkies will still be better than both
---
Sharp pickaxe is where it's at. Looks better than fire axe
---
Would go well with the idea I had for a new event.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcmnq/new\_event\_proposal\_operation\_pest\_control/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcmnq/new_event_proposal_operation_pest_control/)
---
If you are on pc, yes. If you are on console it will come whenever the push the hot fix, hopefully in the next couple days.
---
I demand windows I can jump through. It's how I try to enter most places anyways.
---
All damaged is getting nerfed across the board. Bloodied and Junkies will *still* out-damage Two Shot, Furious, Anti-Armor, etc.
---
We talking about current state of the game, with current rep grind im not gonna bother with rep on 4 more characters, because its unfun, tedious and not a content at all. Sadly, they not gonna change it with all that mobile game mentality. You said you earn rep, while we are not, its boring 3 dailys all over again, its not some kind of skill or accomplishment, you could farm dungeons in wow for rep, for example, actual content. Peace 😉
---
Because monay (read in Tim curry voice)
---
Patch notes said they issued a fix that solved most cases, but not all.
---
It would definitely be a nice addition. I've always thought the main Whitesprings Resort area was very underutilized as a hub. Maybe they could put some of it there.
---
How are you failing? Even if they spawn far away the amount of time they give you is more then enough to run toward them and kill them all. 
---
I soloed
---
bog area just fine. Savage divide usually has tons of players.
---
I remembered when I first started playing and I did the running test for the fire breathers. Some naked dude approached me to see what I was doing and saw I was doing the test. He proceeded to race me and absolutely left me in the dust. He convinced me for a while that wearing no armor meant I was going to be faster
---
It's how 76ers do. We have an even less healthy relationship with nuclear weapons than the church of atom.
---
Hopefully it's a max rep reward. It's a nice gesture if you grinded through those dailies so much, but it's not necessary to remove even more cap sinks from the game for everybody. Especially since all those duped gifts and pails are still untouched...
---
Only took 5 months to make such a small quality of life change we've asked for on a bi-weekly basis...
---
I  wouldn't take 76's quests seriously  
---
They are just there to provide an excuse for online events mostly
---
They are using mobile game and fortnite tactics
---
Master system. Nice
---
I wish they'd add text chat to the PTS. Would give them a chance to see how players like it and shit.
---
I had to look up the term “afk”.... now I get it.  I would never go afk during fo76 at all LOL
---
The more you know 💫
---
Denial of what?
---
We also failed ours in cranberry bog due to the same issue.
---
My friend stacks enough to be running round a nuke zone with no rad protection
---
Not really. I’ve found quite a bunch of posts on various forums of people with the same problem going back to at least 12 months ago. I did contact support after I exhausted every other troubleshooting option.This was the “fix” that they gave me.
---
All drops have a 9% chance to drop. It's no more rare than the Chally outfit, or the Bloody Chef hat from last year - it's all in the same drop pool. It will be extremely common, not like the Croc backpack.
---
Brotherhood collectron station sounds interesting.
---
There's no .50 receiver on the LMG. It's either. 308 or ultracite .308.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Light_machine_gun_(Fallout_76)
---
Do you have a picture of the backpack?
---
Most of the good skins come from NW, which most of the playerbase seems to avoid.
---
You get the Prime Meat as the even completion reward. REMEMBER to turn it in at the Meat Cook (the yao guai on a spit near the middle fire)! You get 5 scrip for the 5 meat it allows you to turn in at a time!
---
The tutorial tricked me into thinking perk card loadouts were a thing
---
Making it account wide isn’t the solution and it be a very lazy thing to do.. instead they should rework the rep system and make it more Engaging because they are adding lots of more rep as the game get older
---
If there was word about it, that's where it would have been.
---
Ouch... you hurted the "special snowflake's" feeling it seems...
---
It's a pretty easy source of treasury notes, especially when your server is dry on events. Even more so if they don't fix that silly bug where the settlers daily autocompletes and doesn't remove anything from your inventory
---
I killed every creature and still event fails. Has anyone got this error too?
---
Oh lordy....it begins. Hey at least critters are spawning.... Heh.
---
I know. But I have a Furious and a Two shot. Also, damage calculation is different post nerf so furious should be affected more harshly than two shot.
---
Just want to know if someone has tested this yet.
---
After 2 repeats I close the game, no more patience for Beth BS
---
Also [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcumc/psa\_your\_tents\_at\_primal\_cuts\_are\_affecting\_where/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcumc/psa_your_tents_at_primal_cuts_are_affecting_where/)
---
There's already a couple dupes people are just hiding em from the public for now
---
Ya I get annoyed when people complains that why did they nerf everything by a lot but not lower it a little bit...
---
I face palm at these comments and posts.
---
Me too, ticket submitted
---
Again I probably wasn't on this subreddit when all those false bans happened.
---
Just had that happen in Cranberry Bog, too, on PS4.
---
are you logged in when it changes? i log out and wait til 25 after then login.. no problems since
---
Radscorpion emperor seems fun. Would there even be a point to it burrowing? Seems like it wouldn't matter if a giant scorpion emerged. Or maybe they could do it like the dark souls 2 najka fight where the burrowing IS the threat
---
It’s just what it sounds like I assure you...
---
 I only met two as well. A level 300 and his friend who destroyed my camp and my friend’s camp. Other than that one experience it’s been all nice players though.
---
Oh no, I drop all known plans to new players. I just a junk hoarder and have a decent amount of aid items and fusion cores.
---
Its fun till you're god tier and run out of things to do.
---
Primal Cuts is every 15 mins, upon completion you get Prime Meat in various amounts depending on where you did it) At the top of every hour Meet Week begins. Take the Prime Meat you have earned so far and turn it in at the spit with the yao guai on it. You get 1 scrip for each Prime Meat you turn in!
---
I also get this but, my wife doesn't.  I think it's a graphic rendering problem. I have a 1080 ti she has a 960.
---
They should probably implement a feature to transfer items between characters that's not essentially an exploit first.
---
I like this. Commenting to see conversation on my break.
---
yea it would be perfect
---
PHRASING
---
With Wastelanders. Old voice actor was Ray Chase; new voice actor is Dave Fennoy.
---
How do you know it is? There was a camp and a few tents at the event I did and completed pretty quick.
---
Same here, you're not alone.
---
Pts players get a camp item?
---
It's inexcusable that the bug still exists, but it's also not that hard to prevent. Don't check the atom shop/legendary run board before joining an adventure mode server, wait a minute or two after loading in before checking either of those things, don't start off a fresh session with NW
---
Are I guessing or do you actually have any proof at all
---
Even 5 minutes is safe, if you log in to Adventure mode first (and you do not enter to NW, Atom Shop, Run table first).
---
Mine hasn't been working right for at least the past 5 months
---
If you can't nuke the mine yourself yet, this event probably isn't for you. It's not like the SBQ or encryptid where if you're not really contributing it doesn't matter. Sadly, I myself, even though I have a fairly high-level character that pulls through all the other events just fine, probably won't do it because I don't have a build or the weapons to contribute on this one. I'd hate the event to fail because I can't pull my weight.
---
Luckily, this isn't a limited-time event and you'll get there soon.
---
I have the issue too Not only is my friends list broken, but everyone is named “player.” I can’t join another person and they can’t accept my invite.
---
&gt; How is this game so fucked up all the time? 
---
It begins with B and ends with an A
---
Have a guess.
---
I have random settlers and traders at my location as well.  They just show up
---
Seems like the same people that got hit that one Tuesday and missed out on all the weekly challenges. I wonder what it is that we have in common that’s making us victims of this bug? I’m rank 91 too, hmm
---
I have an issue similar to this... 3 in 4 spawns will force me to choose another server, and of the times I just gone ahead without my camp building, 1 in 3 spawns will be because of someone else's camp, the other 2 spawns will be for no reason, it has even allowed me to place my camp on the same spot without cost, I just wasn't allowed to spawn my camp there.  
---
There maybe a fleeting reason why my camp slot was unavailable during those times, but its is strange I have issues every-time I log into the game.  My camp is up from the Wayward across from Slocom Joes, it is popular around that area but not in my specific placement area.
---
You said what I was going for, but better thank you. Yeah that’s what I want it wouldn’t be too bad. I’d be easy for the whole community.
---
I moved my shower into a locked room because I'm bloodied and didn't want to lose rads every time I walked into my house because people don't bloody turn it off
---
I have a couple of these but I never really use them or my furious. I use my quad pump being it’s magic and wrecks stuff.
---
I was super curious, so I might as well share my results, yeah?
---
Find a window or two, if you get the bench prompt through the window press it, you spawn inside, leave them some spoiled meat as thanks
---
There's entire discord groups and Facebook pages dedicated to just exploiting the game in every way they can after they realized I was reporting the stuff they were doing I got banned from it all
---
Oh yeah, that's what I'm rocking right now.
---
Kind of wish the Cursed stuff had a fancy skin, but overall, I'm happy with its ability to butcher things.
---
I have failed two out of five events so far. Once in the Mire, once in Toxic Valley.
---
I didn’t miss out on all the weekly challenges from Tuesday, just the destroy robots one.
---
Plus my friends list won’t load and primal cuts in the mire keeps failing after we kill the last primal creature.
---
Make a new level 1 character and use throwing knives and sneak to push into the high level areas of the map quicker than you would normally be able to. Scrap all the weapons you find into steel and convert to knives. The level ups flow like water.
---
You're late.
---
Same here, had 3 or 4 mins on timer and event failed...
---
Yea I noticed the fast game. A few quick tags are enough. Just need the XP
---
Yeah that’s what I said
---
I had to relocated my C.A.M.P. because of this.
---
I know, last we heard about it they said “later in the week” I figured this would’ve been the time to say when in the week that would be. Has me worried it’ll be delayed further
---
Nice try Todd.
---
I don't think Mr T has anything to do with it... nor any of the A team come to that.
---
I own it, and it converts...well it takes your ammo and gives you points for it..then you can spend your points in it for the ammo you actually want.  It doesn't just spit out ammo for free.
---
Lol no the rad kelp. I know how to get the bear arm.
---
Come across this three times in a row - we kill everything at the last phase, then watch and wait as the timer slowly makes its way to zero.
---
Ps4 if that makes a difference
---
It would be the closest they'd ever come to paying us for play testing, which is, you know, something people are often paid for. This community has gone above and beyond in doing bethesda's job for them many times, so it wouldn't be uncalled for to give a reward like atoms to the people who continue to do that
---
I mean... that's your decision. It's still pretty much the same game, just with human NPC's and more stuff to do and grind for. Sometimes there is lag. Sometimes not. Just boot it back up if you already own it and decide for yourself
---
Same here. Thought it was a problem on my end. I play on PC btw
---
Time for a Mystery Men playthrough. You have Mr. Furious and the Shoveler in one character!
---
I guess I'm not convinced those tactics translate well to such a different product such as this. Fortunately this Atomic shop stuff is optional to the game. I've seen mobile games where you couldn't even continue playing without continually paying.
---
Mine isn't. XB1. Restarted 4 times.
---
I like my PA char (no mutations, no bloodied and no chems). I have 2× Calibrated Shocks and Motion Assisted Servos on my T60 (along with BoS Knight CPT paint). Of course, I wanted this char to be built like a BoS Knight or even Paladin (missing the Paladin paint plans).
---
I do have 2 other Char's that will not be using PA. The first is a Bow/ Crossbow user (for now) that uses chems and alcohol (my attempt at playing a raider).
---
The second is gonna be a BoS/ Responders combat medic using pistols (again, no chems, alcohol or mutations)
---
Most likely reason is a wayward critter that has no marker. Like a mole rat. Fan out from the drum to draw its attention.
---
They still get rewards even dead
---
One of my engineering professors had a version of this. "There are no stupid questions, only stupid people who don't ask questions".
---
That's irrelevant. You don't need to be present on this subreddit to come to the conclusion that a studio as flawed as Bethesda can goof with automated bans. It's just common sense. Anything automated is bound to include false positives. No system is perfect. 
---
Either way, you refuted my initial point by implying you never saw a clean player being banned as if my argument was discutable, and now you admit you only have a limited perspective...  Bit of a backward approach to the subject, don't you think?
---
Well, a half-decent player with bloodied and unyielding doesn't really know what dying is either
---
Had this happen 3 times in a row now - very disappointing
---
I had another post I was commenting about in this thread... need to pay closer attention.
---
Do you think it’s worth restarting my character with all the new additions that have come in? I was nearly done with the story, but I have no clue if the Wastelanders update added onto the story or something, and again my current build is completely foreign to me now
---
Same here on PS4
---
Yea mine is far away from me so when I'm afk I don't get cooked. I know this problem well.
---
If they really wanted "as many players as possible" to provide feedback, they would make PTS available for console players as well. Plus I want that camp item.
---
PC is bugged as well
---
It’s in testing right now so there’s no way to be sure what the finished product will be. They could break ghoul slayers weapons and make them magic on accident lol 😂
---
Obviously I'll be on a drum. Ran the event already both weeks last year and maybe about 25% of the runs I just drummed since my kids got in the way of doing much more.
---
yeah if yoku are gonna use vats look into the magic shotguns.  otherwise its okay.
---
worried why? it's a permanent feature in the game. enjoy meat week, ACP will be here at some point and then you can play that.
---
Eh, there’s quite a few things in this game that do considerably more damage then they probably should &amp; then there’s the stimpak’s not working the first time &amp; blah blah so not really but okay lol
---
Will do. I think I saw it today and favorited it, but have not watched yet.
---
It managed to fix itself about 30mins after the launch, thankfully it’s up and running
---
not really, but whatever
---
Just had it happen on PS4 too. Took down the last beasts and it still failed
---
 Thanks for all the feedback! I really appreciate it. I even have had someone offer to help level my new alt. Very grateful.
---
Is that why I keep getting prime cuts spawning at my camp? It's been trashed twice now :(
---
Lol that's my kind of raider
---
However Radkelp is one of the ingredients needed during PP .  To spawn the animals.
---
That'd require logic and actual server work which Bethesda is averse towards.
---
My post literally says “I saw some patch notes that it was supposed to be fixed”.
---
Yeah, same. Mole rats and Scorpions need to be removed from the event list.
---
Another well tested event...
---
Exactly what iam talking about. Unique rewards from dungeons or raids should be absolute norma and it is sort of there but again ,,poorly executed” the rewards are stupid like legendary shovel or its not interesting. People wanna see new stuff not reskined or old stuff with some cursed bullcrap.
---
Mirelurk kings are ridiculous. I was trying out a  junkie's plasma crossbow today, ~600 damage sneak criticals on the normal glowing mirelurks killed them in one hit. A 1200 damage headshot on a glowing mirelurk king didn't even take off a third of his health. Thankfully my thorn armor kept me hidden while I blasted away at him, but it took way too many bolts to take him down. Pretty sure the nearby queen was easier to kill and she detected me
---
For at least a quarter of the legendary run so far I've been logged in at 9:00 PST (when the challenges reset) and this is the first time my dailies got bugged so that doesn't really matter.  
---
When I lost 5,000 points to weekly challenge auto completes, I was not logged in for hours before or after the reset.
---
The cookout is always at the top of the hour, on the hour. Equip good with salt perk. 
---
Problem solved.
---
If your build is so fragile you can’t move a few points, I don’t know what what to tell you.
---
lol yeah log out when it refreshs. Dont even look at your game.   Shoot I give myself a 45 min on each side of my refresh time.
---
to paraphrase a quote from one of my favorite movies:
---
"how did you know where and when to eat, if it wasn't in the manual?"
---
"I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time."
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
That really goes without saying, yet you said it anyway.
---
I personally wouldn't start over. Instead, just jump back in and begin the Wastelanders content. At a certain point, you have to be around level 20 to continue that additional content, so just use your existing toon. Once you finish wastelanders, there's a grind for gold bullion that can take months to get everything you want, and it's best to grind all that out with a higher level character.
---
But starting fresh can be fun too. I played wastelanders with my existing character but am starting over with a new one now to start with all the stuff I unlocked in the legendary run. And just to go through the story all over again. So really theres no wrong way to dive back in
---
What? You don’t like (Clean) Suit Recolor No. 1001?
---
neither has mine
---
I have all my doors locked, but I have workbenches and a storage outside so anyone can do ever uh thing they need without having to come into my house, also my vendors are outside.
---
Because it’s been delayed 2 times prior to this week, 3 times for consoles, and I wanna take a shot at it. The raid bosses are my favorite content in the game. I love meat week don’t get me wrong, I’m just dying to have a go at ACP. Not mad about it, but I just want some info or an update on progress towards a console release
---
Meat week Grahm always had the wrong voice...
---
I didn't need you pointing out how you misunderstood the patch notes a second time. The first time was enough.
---

---
Why use a switch for your rad shower when you can use pressure plate?
---
I hate it. I get stuck so many times every playsession. I try walking some, going from 3rd person to first person. Shooting stuff, going in building then out. All to fast travel. Drives me nuts.
---
seems like the bug hit hard today.  Many posts on this
---
I can confirm being logged in does not trigger it. ANYTHING can trigger it. I was logged in today through reset just fine with no autocompleted. But last 2 days Both were autocompleted even though I logged on after reset. The bug hits people on RNG basis. Some never get it. Some have it every day for weeks 🤷‍♂️
---
When there's info, they'll provide us with it.
---
Mine isn’t. PC.
---
Primal cuts in the savage divide spawned enemies in the ground so it was impossible to complete and cranberry bog timed out I guess. Plus the frame rates were rough
---
In my first one, we failed because the final wave never spawned though time was left, but the next three on the same server all completed successfully without any problems.
---
It’s not solved. The point is the game explains nothing, and why wouldn’t Grahm just always be there? The point of my post is how poorly implemented and explained significant events are, thanks for not reading.
---
What is the camp item?
---
Fair point.
---
First time this happens to me. All were auto completed except 2. So there is no fix to this, at all? I was in the game when the challenges switched and I didnt receive any new ones. Then they appeared, completed. This game just keeps fucking you over, time and time again...
---
why are people assuming this was fixed?!? there are at least 10 posts DAILY about this.
---
Instigating is a magic effect, so this shotgun is good in VATS.
---
Oh ok, not last Tuesday though but like a few weeks ago, a lot of people fell victim to this bug on a teusday where they dropped a bunch of 1000-1500 point challenges that a lot of us missed out on. Quite the set back
---
These are public events. When you click on them, they explain what to do. 
---
Grahm is always there. You just can’t donate meat outside of the event. 
---
It’s a pretty simple event. I understand you are new. Once you play it a couple times you’ll get the hang of it and be a pro. It’s a week long event and coming back in September. 
---
Take a deep breath. Equip the perk. Have some fun.
---
Same exact ones for me! So annoying! WHY do this to us?!
---
Heh,[ here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/) I posted this right after you did!
---
It does, as I am now the proud owner of a Furious Pitchfork.
---
Pretty much this. There’s a slight learning curve, but Grahm will have the event humming soon enough.
---
I just put my camp in a location that no one would think to have it.
---
its been a thing months.  Honestly I use mine only if the SBQ time gets below 10 minutes.  But there are a couple gactors that wont let it trigger like low FPS and slow server response time.
---
ha.  You are funny
---
Because it's combined with my rad shower and radiation emitters, if they both turn on it's counter productive.
---
Lol. That’s not what they said
---
I got sick of this happening so I leave the doors off now lol
---
Yeah, a shared stash across characters would be so so convenient, especially if it let you share the bullion plans. No way in hell any sane person would rep grind more than once or twice.
---
FINALLY, someone with the quads to squat mid-air!
---
Plan for the meat tenderizer. Will it be possible to pull legendaries, when you have the plan?
---
A small wall „flag” similar to the one you get from VTU Nuclear Winter Challanges
---
It seems like way more people got the auto complete bug today than normal.
---
Thanks. I missed it last year. I was running around trying to figure out shit and just beat on the barrels hoping I was helping, lol
---
This... 😭 I feel your pain man so annoying
---
Seems futile, but what the hey  :)
---
So u don’t actually have any proof of an ongoing dupe then. Can’t see that there is as the only thing left to dupe is armour and that’s just not being sold at all
---
No. Yes. No.
---
Thank you great help this
---
Teel peopplle on mic to pack up their Tents.  Seems to be screwing with spawns
---
I get that it drops a few bullet points like all events do, but it doesn’t explain the gameplay loop well. There’s no connection point linking prime cut events to a once an hour turn in timer. One can eventually figure it out, but the game does as little as possible to help them. Thankfully, the community is so strong to make up for it, but Beth shouldn’t keep using that as a crutch.
---
if you have it you can also add feed to challys trough
---
If on PC I recommend better inventory mod. Makes life so much better.
---
I mean.....
---
Play NW anytime and you're doomed to this bug happening at some point - just stop playing NW!  Just get your score from other means.
---
I just did my first meat week event ever and got the bloody chef outfit lol
---
Wow, god roll indeed. Thanks for replying!
---
Thanks, is there a planned release date for “A colossal problem” or legendary perks?
---
If placed near or on the spawn points it glitches out enemy spawns
---
Not understanding this randomizer, but if you've fun go for it.
---
You should check definitely Mutations. I don't no high level player with atleast one mutation
---
&gt;We now have a chance to get the Meat Tenderizer plan. Learning this plan will allow it to drop legendary from the Purveyor, her mystery picks, and random legendary enemies. The weapon itself is still in the drop list as well.
---
Yes!! Everything helps at the Meat Cook!
---
Lol. I’ve never participated but after the last one and Bethesda fully endorsing it by letting them all back with their accounts fully intact I doubt they will even bother to patch the next one. Just seems pointless
---
It's a separate download on the bethesda launcher. Was an over 100gb download for me.
---
Nope, should be for everyone.
---
Apparently it added nothing. Why are you so worried about it? I believe I misread the post originally or meant to comment on another comment. 
---
Does it make you feel better about yourselves to be assholes? 
---
What has your post added, man? Unless it was your intention to show the sub that you're a doucheknob?
---
Yes! Thank you! I completely missed that!
---
That's why I can't get primal cuts lol
---
So where is graham anyways? Lol can’t find it on the map
---
Huh, sounds cool if it can be replicated. That's a lot of screws to use crafting though
---
Super helpful, thank you. I mentioned this in a reply to someone else, but thankfully the 76 community is so strong, that really improves the experience, however Beth should not be using that as a crutch.
---
No. No.
---
Wow, so topical. You that hard up for upvotes or something?
---
I just got my Assassin's Bat. I'm going to use it to bonk Grahm over the head if he doesn't drop something a little more ballistic next time.
---
Yes brother Maynard bring us thy holy hand grenade of Antioch!
---
This game is overly annoying did my second colossal problem a few mins ago and 6 ppl showed up 3 off us got put in one instance and the others in another and the 2 with me got kicked out and it was just me trying to kill it no luck.
---
I have had that happen once before. It's really annoying 😒
---
All these things are poor due to server systeam instead of instancing system like in wow or teso, would be nice if everything would be shared cross server instanced it would end with camp problem and with many other things too.
---
Thank you! Been playing off and on since Beta, and had missed this event in the past.
---
Yeah it’s bugged for everyone I’m assuming
---
Everything might work fine for them on their dev rigs and real private servers.
---
And this is why some bugs don't get fixed.  Instead of people actually submitting tickets most just run to reddit to bitch.
---
Too soon for the you are a cliche internet millennial comments  but good to know im not "entitled" to my own opinions on things.
---
Meat Week has started today but no idea when colossal problem starts.
---
Eight Ball says "not likely".
---
[like this](https://i.imgur.com/LOyEGAC.jpg)
---
I'm pretty sure they announced a release date for legendary perks to be included with patch 22, I may be wrong though.
---
I really hope they actually release it this time.  There is an inside the vault from last year where they said perk loadouts would come in early 2020 but here we are still asking for it.
---
I love this I got a bloody chef outfit chalky moomoo outfit and a chally grill plan
---
Ok thanks. They said near the end of the week so we only have Friday,Saturday and Sunday. Let's see if it gets delayed again!
---
AH! Excellent question, he is to the South West of vault 76! I will add this too!
---
Welcome! Hope you have fun!
---
Ya just had it happen very buggy !
---
I am extremely curious how people are losing score. I haven’t lost any so far and at this point I just want to know what causes it??
---
I have a full set of unyielding armor, and if i dare to enter a PA, i get a loss of 15 points  in all my S.P.E.C.I.A.L except Endurance.  Unyielding is just too good.
---
Just nope. No spiders please. Especially mutated ones. The world is scary enough lol.
---
It'd be much easier to watch a video on it it'll tell you what all to do during the cookout that'll be better for you to see all the task to do.
---
Yup! would like to know what i'm doing also
---
Played it twice so far on Xbox and things went just fine.
---
It seems to be working after the cookout event now wonder if it resets after that one
---
I was there =0
---
first one went fine and then the next 2 failed. It's proper balls!
---

---
Gotcha, just read the itv. Thanks for the info!
---
My pleasure! And I agree...
---
Wow what a coincidence to see you here haha.
---
I assumed but it's always nice to know I'm not just dumb or losing my mind 🤪
---
Haven't had it bug out on me yet. Had two fail because time ran out, but it wasn't because the beasts didn't show up, just because the events had been started late or something, it was usually on the ones I would join after finishing another primal cuts elsewhere.
---
My house doesn't even have a radio in it and yeah he complains about "that robot on the radio" constantly.  Beckett is just the worst house guest, lol.
---
Yeah.
---
My friends join my party in lobby, then I load into private server. It shows them not in my team once in game, and then they are kicked.
---
I submitted a ticket. They gave me a super technical list of stuff to do, which is BS and risky. Apparently its being looked into, but we know how that goes.
---
Just saw it on facebook no mention of colossal problem for co soles
---
Great, so we can rack up 2-300 notes we’ll never be able to spend for the next few months??
---
Tbh I’ll still do the events...just like Fasnacht
---
I would guess it collects energy weapons and energy ammo?
---
Yeah i'm on a 2060 super, it's strange it only happens in random places, might just be a quirk of the engine.
---
🐙 Thanks!
---
I just came to say the same thing. Saw a thread before about it.
---
Ok. So answer the question. When they reset. We’re u logged in. The fact u have been before and they didn’t auto complete is irrelevant. It doesn’t happen all the time. Just some of the time.  And it seems to be if your logged in at the reset. So. Yes or no. We’re u logged in at the reset?
---
Today is Aug 20th and I'm still getting the challenge autocomplete bug. It has now happened several times and I'm pretty sure it's because I was logged in during the reset moment.
---
It was working fine on the server I was on, had 3 people on the spits at the last event, bugged server perhaps? Seen people complaining about primal cuts being bugged too and that was also fine on the server I played on, successfully completed 2 of the cookouts before logging for the night. This was on PC.
---
Have u been logged in when it resets. Seems it may be that. Never had it....touches wood.....and never been logged in at reset as I’m usually at work
---
&gt; Stay near the barrel used to start the event. The beasts will come to you.
---
I am already seeing a bug where this is not always the case. I have had Primal Cut events in Cranberry Bog and Savage Divide today already spawn primal creatures very far away and if we hadn't gone hunting for them, the event would have failed.
---
Sometimes you do have to run after them.
---
Guys don’t listen to him. If the primal beasts aren’t coming to you, go out to the quest markers. If you wait too long the event will fail and you’ll get nothing
---
Yeah this one is harder to double up unless different groups are triggering the various locations.
---
Just create a new toon. Takes 5mins to get a level.
---
Going to the bathroom so sorry if I afk for a minute.
---
You’re like Santa Claus if he were a dick
---
Once upon a time they were worth 30k
---
I just used Nukes and Dragons to rebalance my build so that I can run around speedy like using AP refresh armor, and an unarmed weapon, for Primal Cuts and the cookout but also jump into Power Armor and use heavy weapons for ACP and the SBQ fight, without having to swap out perk cards.
---
Many players try to do Primal Cuts in Power Armor and just stay near the starting area while I'm running around like a mad man trying to take out the shy critters who don't seem to want to come out and play. The thing is, if someone doesn't doesn't go to them, chances are you are going to run out of time and fail.
---
I really enjoy, and actually prefer, doing the primal cut events solo. The somewhat tricky part is that stealth is broken during the event so unless you can one or two shot the Alpha miniboss using melee, I choose to use a heavy weapon to take them out in just a few seconds.
---
What's the date?
---
Okay I will make that change! Thank you!
---
Faschnat flash backs.
---
Can someone dupe the ever living fuck out of the croc backpack plan so I might be able to get one without having to trade a fkn legacy, which I don't even have, for it please k thx
---
On Xbox, had 2 so far succeed without issue. Hopefully it is just lag causing an issue and it wont last too long.
---
*sigh*
---
Dear rainbow3nigma
---
NO!!
---
Regards 
---
Bethesda
---
Like the idiots that do this really care. LoL. They are cool and fallout warriors LMAO. When in reality they don’t know their head from a hole in the ground and have the IQ if a tic-tac.
---
Oh man. Do NOT play Grounded.
---
Oh it’s massively duped. It’s just people are still paying stupid amounts for it. There’s actual posts that state they have 10 or posts where there’s 6 karma statements for 6 separate sales.
---
I was living (level 30-50) on the golf course next to the little creek by the putting green, so I could farm water with 6 pumps. I had a 70% success rate of it being available. 
---
I recently moved to a location with an independent "acid mine" in another river, I suspect I am going to have a bad time finding an available server...
---
I can't image what the high lvl ppl go thru since the dangerous/great resource spots must be super popular...
---
Server stopped responding as it said final prime was approaching and disconnected me. Next server, mission fails right after it says approaching. 0 for 2 for me.
---
Sort of what I do having kids too. The drum and spits are sort of the unsung heros of the game. Keeps the bar from going backwards as others clean and do the chores. Fun event but scary when I see a lot of ppl standing around with open spits out drums.
---
What happened to the forest camo outfit
---
1:1 max 15 per event.
---
I guess. I think it’s pretty simple honestly. 
---
I do agree with your mention of atlas though as that doesn’t have any indication something special is going on there. Even a special map marker would do
---
I'm level 91 of the legendary run and this is the second time I've hit the bug.  The first time I was logged out, the second time I was logged in.  If you're collecting stats, put me down for one of each -- and this time was the logged in time.
---
I removed the ammo converter because the fix was more confusing and time consuming than it is worth dealing with
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Reddit exists for us to bitch not our fault they give us so much to bitch about. I can only imagine the number of tickets they get in a day and this particular issue like many are old and still dont get fixed. The whole run is based on dailies and it was broke long ago and they still haven't corrected it. Its the main part of the whole thing. Neither option seems to help in getting real issues resolved unfortunately.
---
How often does meat week go off? Is it every hour like fasnacht?
---
Double score just started and 6 of my dailies just auto completed. So long 3000k SCORE!
---
Logged out right before or logged in right after the first time? Or off for half hour either side?
---
ACP should be soon.  Seems like they pushed it off again due to bugs.  Legendary perks got pushed to patch 22 in September
---
As many as you can. You can turn in Prime Meat in chunks of 5 as many times as you are able at the meat cook! Hold on to any extra and add to it with more Primal Cut events.
---
Your contributions are really just to get you scrip
---
Ye on the hour
---
It collects technical plans, then refuses to give them to you.
---
Yeah. Can't see my friends list. Can't join through xbox, get message saying "friends list couldn't be verified"
---
It is out when the patch comes out. They never said that was today, just that they hope it is later in the week depending on how things go on PC.
---
It seems they left some features in.
---
Nope - they haven't bothered to let us know when the hotfix will be dropped for consoles.
---
Unless there's so few servers you can't find another this seems odd.
---
Same here.
---
Sounds like something Beth have not fixed for ages.
---
😆 keep going on, this is amusing
---
Or I have 10 meetings to be on today and barely have enough time to man the drums during work hours?
---
Next patch is set for September. I don't think I've seen an exact date.
---
That happened to my friend the Tuesday just gone.
---
At my camp, my house is locked, that's my own private slice of the wasteland. All my workbenches are outside in my prefab RR garage which is unlocked, feel free to use them. But if my shop is closed, don't be a dick and glitch your way into my house and start buying stuff.
---
Alas, yes lol
---
2x0=0
---
Did you check the timer? One of the events I was at, the timer ran out and it failed and literally everyone at the event started doing the confused emote, I was wondering if they didn't notice the timer or if the timer was showing the wrong time for them or something.
---
Ive read the feedback and bug reporting on the PTS forums. It’s stuff like, I don’t like the artwork for the new season. So I won’t be playing it! 
---
Seriously there’s more talk of “bugs” and “feedback” here then on the PRS forums.
---
They need better testers. Not crybabies who are only interested in sneak peeks at the new content.
---
People will really bitch about anything.
---
agreed. people downvoting common sense is making me chuckle.
---
I open all the doors in every camp I visit because I find it absurd that you give a shit.
---
I normally come back dead
---
No sever issues for me on pc so far, but I am having issues with my friends list. None are showing other then ‘RECENT’
---
Me either.
---
Is there much point doing primal cuts other than the max of 15 scrip?
---
I would love that. I hate that I can only use one type of weapon  because without the 9 perk cards I only tickle enemies
---
Whait, you guys got doors?
---
Have you tried to submit a ticket for F76?  Go ahead, try.  The support system is frustratingly weird to navigate.  There actually is no "bug report" option!  
---
Maybe, before you start spewing about people and their shortcomings, you might consider we aren't all doofuses.
---
My friends list on XB1 won't work it gives a big error when I enter the social menu
---
Some people are jerks
---
Yes YES YYYYEEEEEESSSSSSS
---
Ah that’s unfortunate man, I’m on PS4 and it fixed itself quite quickly
---
Everything helps at the Meat Cook. Some people can't help but AFK for any number of reasons, so this is a good option.
---
why would you think that? there was no announcement saying that.
---
You can complete the event even if no one is on drums or spits. All that does is help keep the bar from decreasing. If you gather up a bunch of meat to turn in and then turn it all in right before the event ends (like about the 15 second mark), the meter will shoot up from 0% to 100% all in one go.
---
Who’s downvoting you?
---
It seems to me that you get the points even though it looks like you've already completed the challenges. So keep track of which you've done already I guess?
---
I don't get people that get mad when you try use their vendors
---
/u/ladydevann
---
Yes, failing a otherwise easy event because three people showed up and two of them are playing the drums is totally not something worth bitching about.
---
Most people are jerks.
---
I saw on this reddit that pc players got it etc etc
---
People are gonna AFK this event, just like Fasnacht. There's no reason not to if they're busy, working, at school, eating, or sleeping. Even if 6/8 events fail, they're still getting rewards for the other 2 that passed which is better than 0. To get heated over this is just pissing in the wind, it's going to be happening all week. Just concentrate on the tasks that require you to be present so everyone wins.
---
I built an outdoor workshop with the vending machines so players can stay out of my house
---
After handing in 3x5 prime cuts, you get meat sweats which does not allow you to hand anymore in, am guessing OP is asking if he can only do the 15 pieces and therefore should refrigerate the spares he has, or will the meat sweats disappear so OP can hand in more meat during the same event?  
---
Well OP probably isn't asking, but I am.
---
I don’t see a problem here. It’s a very important support role.
---
Probably haven’t. It’s been a weird couple months at the office so I can’t say I haven’t played during work hours before haha. Does seem like more people bring it up close to daily/weekly server reset
---
Old Ironsides would approve
---
They're all jerks.
---
👍
---
If only a prompt in-game mentioned it...
---
When Super Mutants walk in and track in mud and shit and piss all over my wallpaper and furniture I care
---
Daily Ops will have some as rewards. [See JuiceHead’s latest vid](https://youtu.be/7pHEme4vgck?t=6m35s).
---
We're looking into these reports, thank you!
---
Just had this happen again. I'm about done with this nonsense already. Thought the lunch break would be fun... whoops
---
Yeah. I think leaving it’s half hour before and after seems to be almost no posts where as the half hour or so after reset it’s just post after post.
---
It seems like such an easy fix and those worlds could just be filtered out but i guess not. Cant tell you how many events ive missed out on because of this.
---
Half life 3 is more likely then beth putting something out on time bug free.
---
Crap now the Forest one is bugging out!
---
Do you still get wanted for picking locks?
---
Thanks for the tag, we're looking into this.

---
 &gt; We're looking into these reports, thank you!
---
Edit: Nope. I accidentally completed one of my weekly challenges
---
On Tuesdays the weekly challenges reset.  The daily challenges reset at 9:00 AM PST. 
---
 What happens is, you go to the list of challenges for the first time (that day or week) and some of the challenges are already marked as being completed.
---
But you didn't do them and you didn't get the SCORE reward you would have received if you had.  That is the "auto complete" bug.  
---
No one knows why it happens, so all sorts of voodoo suggestions have been made (don't be logged in at the reset, don't play NW first, don't be named Todd, etc, etc, etc)
---
Bugged all over
---
I've done shittier things out of boredom... we're all jerks
---
Ya it’s a shame about the stealth.
---
This was a huge source of player feedback when Wastelanders dropped, we're happy to bring that to you all.
---
So it seems to be random, the Forest location bugged out but then the Ash Heao one worked (after four attempts).

This exactly lol. Is there any point in getting more than 15. I mean script sure, but im more interested in the event rewards
---
my camp had a hard time loading in today. Like whole walls and sections were missing
---
Yup. And I found out the weapon I’ve been using all along is a magic weapon. Oh well
---
They’re still participating and actually doing something to help so yes go on the drums. It’s better than just standing there and getting in the way.
---
Did you deposit it in the trunk? Were enough people on drums and the spit?
---
Nope. Unless you've been there, there's no need for a FT point anyway, and why should any old stranger get to travel there free?
---
Friends list is fine for me. I’m on PS4
---
My girlfriend kept getting kicked from my party, it said I was kicking her, but I wasn't.
---
Sorry, but you didn't get enough Atoms a month...and that was completing ALL of them...to buy one bundle or a quality big skin in that month and the way the Shop works you could miss loads.
---
Like I say, even with First or buying a chunk from the online stores, the Challenges always made it affordable. They need Atom Challenges back or even double what's within the seasons. The game is a far more interesting when players can look the part and make more than just a wooden hut...
---
I’m in your group lol
---
Can confirm. She does the same thing to me. Even the garden gate which is nowhere near the damn house.
---
I fucking hate that shit
---
I added an [image](https://i.imgur.com/AJ3M3nR.jpg) a that shows how I have it set up if that helps.
---
Oh, I didn't know that. If only we have button or logic gates in FO76.
---
&gt; Starting now, players who log into the PTS and spend time play testing upcoming features will receive a new PTS Pennant reward for their C.A.M.P.s in the live game
---
We don't know the reward, do we?
---
thats the sad part. The lack of oversight to miss this is astounding
---
Yes!! WTF
---
Same thing on XB1. Can’t even go into the social section of the game in the menu without it freezing and having to restart the game.
---
Mines telling me it can't sync every time I open it
---
Easy there cowboy, it's already broken enough. Don't temp them to complicate it.
---
Seems to be random. I've had three in the Ash Heap, one in the Mire, and one in the Forest bug out on me. But I've also completed at least one in each area as well.
---
Nuka mines.
---
I agree to an extent. but as right now im low on acid to craft more gunpowder, this is a good backup. 15 minutes hammering away on railspikes got me enough 5mm to keep my minigun spinning for a lil bit
---
Same to me but luckily if I replace the Camp in the same Place You don't Need to rebuild It
---
thanks for the suggestion. I use the cranberry relish, beef stew and sleep often to get the well rested bonus. It still takes me several hours to level up which doesn't leave me time for anything else.
---
*PA glitch has entered the chat*
---
So, if the plan for the tenderizer drops, does that mean it's possible to get a legendary one from mama murmurgh?
---
Edit: never mind, reading is fundamental kids. Lol.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure someone will be here to say "we're looking into the issue" and then never comment on it again.
---
Too bad your answer didn't fit the question.
---
I remember Fasnach had to be delayed because of bugginess too. It's not like they haven't had weeks to prepare and RUN BOTH EVENTS BEFORE.
---
I'd put your head through the fucking door you whiney little cunt. This post is pointless and attention seeking.
---
Honestly the only downside to me is the most baffling. I'm always over encumbered using it. Regular armor destroys it in that respect with all the weight reduction perks. That's the only fix I think it needs.
---
plus it would allow more of a focus on explorations events d gameplay again. I love survival elements as much as the next bear grylls, but damn they really make you work to keep your bullet supply stocked
---
[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/) ya go!
---
Why can't I spell anything today?
---
One failed just now, just before Prime Queen spawned in the Mire, 10 secs before she spawned it failed lol
---
Has the reward pool changed for Meat Week at all?
---
Was just online there and tried to do it solo twice.  I found there was not enough time to kill all the creature waves before the boss came out.  The creatures were so spread out I spent most of the time running over to them because they didn't approach.
---
Is it intended to be this way?  Do you have to keep banging that drum like in Violent Night to get them to approach?
---
Edit:  Just saw the note about tents!  There was a tent parked there, but no players, so maybe that's why they creatures didn't come anywhere near.  Had to search for them all which killed the timer pretty fast.
---
Will try that.
---
mole rats
---
Look 4 bear on the spit. Depot there. Sometimes ya gotta wait Cuz ppl added already
---
I'll keep it company for you!
---
Take a screenshot of the map before you pick your first lock.
---
&gt; Chally the Moo-Moo Outfit	
---
&gt; Chally the Moo-Moo Mask	
---
&gt; Plan: Chally the Moo-Moo Backpack
---
Well I guess I'm farming this. Is it similar to the one in the Atom shop?
---
[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher too(
---
My bad...I muddied the LMG and the .50 MG together into the same thing. 🤦‍♂️
---
Hope so, would be nice at least. Need to get that meat!!
---
Unarmed doesn't do any damage, you do 8000 with two handed which oneshots any PvP character.
---
Chinese stealth suit + 1 shot build works great.
---
Secondly, no one PvPs in this game lol.
---
There are several new rewards like The Tenderizer plan, beer steins and stuff. I know there are several posts on Reddit with the datamined stuff!
---
I used them all up on one of my characters before I realized what they were capable of doing and was looking forward to getting some from Meat Week. I guess I can’t do that anymore. Now I have to wait for the next season to score some more.
---
I gave her a Mr. Handy body and she was pretty pissy at first but then thanked me and said I did my best. That is about it, there is no other impact on the game. Too bad you can't swap it out like the Mechanist quests in FO4.
---
Ah. Thank you. I didn’t realise that.
---
Thank You!
---
Ran into this too.
---
Did you read it...
---
I know mate.I played this gane more than I want to admit. That item vanishes when the event ends tho. I don't know how to keep it.
---
Happened last year as well.
---
The event pops south west of Vault 76! [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/)
---
I had friends?
---
You turned off player names in settings
---
*You know what I meant...*
---
Unarmed melee or 2H melee. And actually, while I’ve been levelling up all I’ve had is PvP encounters for workshops etc. And don’t forget the damage cap either - it’s all about DPS, not DPH.
---
Welcome!
---
Yeah that would be pretty sick. Have it scroll across the top of the screen when the alert happens/bomb drops
---
Glitching a tent up to 500' in the air isn't a build.
---
Complete freestates misions Abbys bunkier etc
---
Ohh smh
---
Not sure if you have tried this or want to bag it but the toxic goo from westek is how I tend to manage mine when playing bloodied. 125 rads per dose.
---
Was at an event like this earlier. The timer only ran out because nothing happened after we killed the final wave (not sure if we were in the same one just the other side of the coin lol)
---
That's why I like the cursed shovel atm.. Good for events like at the lighthouse, whacking bugs with a satisfying THUNK indeed :)
---
Feel better now?
---
Please just give me a heads up next time, or even just a finger, a thumb up hurts.
---
Same problem on Bethesda net launcher(
---
Oh do tell
---
Carry a Gama gun. Shoot your feet. Free rads.
---
Been trying to find someone selling this too. Good find
---
I only have thumbs :( and wouldn't wanna give head either 😂😂
---
That gas mask outfit looks sick that's the sorta tacticool gear I'm talking about 😁
---
Grahm is pretty easy to find now since it’s meat week.
---
I figured the opportunity for cave dungeons is why Bethesda chose WV for 76’s location. They’ve been saying they’re limited as to what they can add to the current map, so I hope they lean into this.
---
I use a gamma gun with deep dish to manage rads, just shoot at your feet.  In my opinion the gamma gun is the way to go.  I haven’t tried rad emitter but in the dozen or so times I’ve found grahm he has had the plan once
---
There is a way to get all 3 out consistently, its not well known though.
---
Cant deposit it and only the radkelp is displayable tho
---
This may be a dumbass question, but does anyone know where we deliver the primal cuts when we’ve obtained them?
---
Not sure if you've heard but Grahm is going to be pretty easy to find this week.
---
Miniguns with the accelerated barrel and either the Instigating, Junkie's, or Stalker's prefix have a hidden (unintended) furious effect that is seemingly uncapped. There are other examples but I'll refer you to Angry Turtle's videos.
---
It is also what caused me to unintentionally kill Earl in about 10 seconds from first shot to dead, skipping his mutation healing phase. I say unintentionally because what I though was my best magic weapon was taking longer than expected to kill Earl. I then tried another weapon that had been collecting dust and was surprised and what happened next.
---
im fine with 1 bullet giving 0 points. Is that really an issue?
---
Well... maybe for the weekly challenge?
---
get a reduced weight assaultron head, shoot at your feet and you are good
---
Yes. and it's bugged. only 2 out of 7 have succeeded despite killing all of the things.
---
Oh really? Does he still follow the same routes?
---
I dunno if Grahm leaves his cookout spot, but its meat week so you should be able to find him easily and get the plan. I like having one setup, it takes longer than toxic goo  but its good if you don't have anything else to irradiate you quickly. I'm also not a 24/7 bloodied player, I sometimes switch perks and play full hp junkies, so i don't wanna have to fill my stash up with stuff just to irradiate me. Take your armour off and it starts ticking for 30 rads over 5 seconds or something, it takes me about half a dozen doses to get down to 20% hp.
---
This actually happened to me for the first time today. It autocompleted all of my dailies and I wasn’t even logged in. Good thing I wasn’t planning to complete the battle pass anyway, I guess?
---
The top of every hour he will be southwest of vault 76. Just look for the crowd of people on your map.
---
Yes, PC players got it. With a patch. As consoles get the patch too, with the Colossal event, the deep pocket mod will be land too.
---
Yep. Hit me for the first time today.
---
This is an excellent build. I have a character with that build and love it. Tanky, high damage with explosive weapons. Kinetic dynamo and action boy allow me to vats mobs with a the gatling gun. If it's too busy, break out the je50 or lmg and destroy. I do wish the faster guns weren't magic though.
---
So does this pop up on the map for me to travel to, or? Lol this event is highly confusing. Two of the primal cuts have already failed too
---
No. Nobody cares about an issue until it affects them. I'm pissed that this is the sentiment for 90% of the people in this game.
---
The same problem, I have this happen after the first passage Event with Graham(  Launched Scan and Repair (Hope this helps)
---
I am as well and thank you for explaining how the event works but thats not really helpful becuase at the end of the event I get no prime meat at all, not sure if this is happening tot he OP as well but I dont get any for completion
---
Leave the event as it's in progress...
---
Not sure why you would think that.
---
They would have been saved locally on your xbox, I think they're gone
---
The feed option is not the bathtube, but the pile of grey grain.
---
Deal. I just want one thing in return. Don’t ever close my door. I want to run into my house not stop and open my door. Never close my door.
---
&gt; The Game has become to grindy for a solo 2-3 hours a day player  
---
According to this sub, solo players don't matter because how dare you not want to play on a team! This sub is so full of selfish fucks lol.
---
But yeah, it's pretty buggy, maybe once mods come along they'll fix it.
---
Of course they are. They just don’t instantly turn into a meat pile. It’s after some time.
---
Perfect! I'm glad it worked. You are welcome:)
---
&gt;  while you made damage buffs additive, swing speed buffs are still multiplicative
---
You are on the PTS, right?
---
oh. i thought it was going to be on the actual bodies, like how the critter chunks are on the corpses. thank you for the response!
---
It’s so bad. At this point I’m literally not even excited for new stuff now. It never works right, I don’t get my hopes up anymore. I enjoy the game but I’m not looking forward to anything anymore I’ll just keep playing and doing the things in game that I enjoy, I will no longer care about anything bethesda releases until they prove they care too
---
I would prefer if we just got to log in each day to obtain a rank. I'd rather play the way I want, and not be forced to do challenges every day.
---
I can always tell when someone has been in my camp...every door in the place wide ass open !
---
(Edit) thank you so much
---
Yeah more and more people saying that. Thinking it could be the stupid molerats or radscorpions getting stuck. Thankfully I haven't had any fail due to bugs yet.
---
The other guy told me where it is, go to vault 76 and talk to the robot at the bottom of the stairs, and ask about the overseer
---
equipping Can do! and looting whitespring trashcans i think is faster than monster mash for pre war food.
---
Or just make it so camps can be placed closer together. I’m tired of staying on a world to find out their camp is way out of the boundary of mine
---
You’re not wrong.  If you’ve been maxing or near maxing score every day you should be nearly done now if you are also actively playing much at all.  I’ve lost about 4000 to autocomplete bug and I’ll still make the finish line by the weekend, plenty of time to spare.
---
I do suspect all the bonus score will be toned down in season 2, however.  There frankly has been a lot of “extra” score this season.
---
Lol, never thought about that, now I feel bad for dropping all my gamma ammo.
---
Mine just started working. I've successfully joined one of my friends after about an hour.
---
My camp is set up in such a way that I have a store front with my vending machines behind windows, and garage doors (RIP double wall trick) which I use like shutters. They're all wired to the same switch so when the shutters are down, vending machines are off, camp doesn't show on the map and my shop is closed. I only have them off if I'm at/near max caps. Also the only door leading to my vendors is a powered keypad door.
---
If you are on ps4 i think ive learned rad barrel plan, i can build one at your camp?
---
You can get a rad barrel from radiation rumble and use that to give yourself rads on a smaller scale...that’s what I do
---
And still no text chat on that roadmap. How does a MMO in 2018/2020 not have damn text chat, even older mmos have it.
---
The damage cap is only on lots of projectiles, melee doesn't get restricted.
---
You can hit 21K damage and 1shot scorch beasts with a crit.
---
If there is a cap, I've never it when running 2H.
---
I've also one shot players plenty of times, just gotta buff yourself to crazy levels and power attack.
---
They are locally saved and do not sync to any could save of F76
---
Sorry, but they're gone
---
Nice! Do you make non-legendary versions with the plan or legendary versions (with legendary modules)?
---
destroy the whole camp next time
---
When the weeklies auto-completed, I was off for three hours before, and two and a half hours after.  (I had insomnia, woke up and played 4AM-6AM, then didn't get back on until 11:30 AM)
---
On many other days, I would be on from 8:00 AM until 8:30 AM while eating breakfast, with no problems encountered.  Sometimes I would be on during the reset, and never had a problem.
---
Sounds like BGS took inspiration from project Plowshare, in which the US government tested nuclear weapons for peacefully construction purposes.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Plowshare
---
I just had 3 fail in a row. 
---
1 just didn't complete and 2 didn't have the final wave
---
cowards
---
Creep
---
Yep looks like it I got the outfit just need the mask
---
I’m pretty sure it does, I know from when I had a 30k damage per hit build and it took three hits to put a guy down.
---
It may have been the wrong voice but I still liked it.
---
I wish I had just one of those machines,still need to up my raider rep
---
What sort of Gauss Shotgun are you using?
---
Ack yep thanks!
---
Once Graham's event starts near 76 you can put them on his pot for more points
---
Just failed two in a row for what? It’s just killing waves of mobs?
---
One of the best additions to the game ever. Big fan.
---
Yes it will pop as a World Event just south west of 76!
---
Alright, I just witnessed a bost disappear and its contents got scattered on the floor, there were some bullets some meat and some acid acraps(it was a yao guai) also there were some hides on the floor, happened to 4 or 5 bodies as far as I can tell
---
Your not forced to do anything at all. You choose to do the ranks. You could also buy ranks. But no ones forcing you to do anything. Think about what your proposing. Getting a rank just for logging in. First that’s not worth any prizes other than maybe 100caps. Second of all games should present some challenge. Free prizes and a season pass should be some sort of challenge.
---
OP is clearly Todd Howard.
---
Eh, for how little I already play the game now, I'd rather play the "stable" (hah) version that works as I expect. I don't have time to test Bethesda's wacky ideas.
---
Unfortunately don't have a heavy explosive to deal a quick destructive blow. Had to be sneaky and use my golf club, justice served since the camp was at whitesprings IMO.
---
So only a few players are allowed inside ACP for that instance, any extra players get put into their own lobby. Unfortunately it seems like the game saw you as the only outlier or +1 so it threw you in its own session.
---
Might be some legendary effects completely negate 1 shots, not sure
---
Glad I'm done. Every daily just auto completed on a double score day
---
Am I the only one not really bothered by this?
---
Weekly challenge, or possibly just douchery.
---
damn lol my tse minigun levels shit in under a second
---
Not sure on the timer, i joined in the middle.
---
It’s been about 50% failure rate for me. Seems that the last prime beast fails to spawn and then the timer elapses.
---
Sometimes random enemies will not turn into meat piles, specially if you have the work bloody mess. Instead they will just drop the guns, ammo, junk, or meat. Depending on the enemy. Happens to me when I kill super mutants.  After I kill them they just turn into laser rifles and ammo
---
Cool story but you cant destroy camp items unless you are in active pvp with the owner
---
You could try figuring it out on your own?
---
Yes I’m with you my brethren.
---
I think there is a limit of 10 players, so the slowest to join get screwed.
---
She is american - i fixed it :) I ask her out later - she offer a very long mission set.
---
We are aware of this issue and are working to resolve this today.
---
And I would bet a dollar that they consider this a "just live with it" problem, since the Legendary run ends in 12 days.  Unless it becomes an issue with a majority of players, they aren't going to commit developer time and effort to something that will go away on it's own.
---
The mascot outfit and headpiece seem to be somewhat common, tons of people have them.
---
I feel your pain!
---
That's very unfortunate..
---
They need to stop releasing things and just fix things. That’s what anthem is doing
---
Why didn’t you go and kill the creature If you saw him lead it away?
---
Yeah I failed the last one even though there was still time and everything was dead
---
I think op is referring to the glitched ammo factory machines. 
---
I went to Tyler County Dirt Track and found rows of those machines
---
Have a fantastic day :D
---
That's it, just killing waves, the mobs dont spawn in time, it stalls sometimes, the event fails just before the last mob spawns sometimes.
---
Is it possibly due to the Fallout 1st survival tents or people's camps?
---
It's 8 I believe
---

---
 &gt; We are aware of this issue and are working to resolve this today.
---
Yup live and nearly impossible with the server lag, frame rate issues and bugged primal cuts. Let alone folks not knowing what they should do at grahms cookout. Ugh
---
Not a camp item, its the munitions factory ammo collector.
---
Use the terminal to change it.
---
Does the time it takes my inventory or the vendor screen to load count?
---
I’ll probably try for 1 minute to even interact with the vendor instead of pulling out my axe on him and then the next 30 seconds wondering how that bug even came into existence. After that I’ll sell those 50 shrooms and brain fungus I picked up yesterday for the weekly challenge before they spoil. If I have time I’ll get my 3 scrips from another legendary pipe.
---
Ah yeah, stocking up on the Red Fireworks mines might just pay off.
---
Ahh I'm still learning this game and all its abbreviations and glitches,cheers for clueing me in!
---
No, often no camp or tent anywhere near, the Mire seems worst for failing.
---
Those will go nicely with the 628 notes I already have waiting to be turned in.
---
Could have been trying to get the 'Kill 20 players' trophy/achievement. But honestly a workshop that is built up costs like 70+ caps and killing the workshop owner only nets 50 caps with potentially more caps if they had junk on them, though they usually shouldn't if they know better. So it's really not even worth it to kill people over a workshop, since it comes off as a net deficit. The only other answer you're going to get is that he was being a tool and wanted to kill someone because he was bored.
---
Ahh, must have been someone shooting them with the bloody mess perk, I was already envisioning the problems people were gonna be having at line in the sand, thank you for clarifying
---
I don’t have any doors because it slows down movement in the camp and takes up useful space.
---
I stand corrected.
---
I can imagine. Should be called the shredder.
---
Think with moleminers being a type of npc, like with madam mumbles, we would get an underground update. Where we find moleminer city. Ants would be a great enemy to fight espically fire ants from FO3
---
Patch 21 seems to have made this soo much worse!
---
Also - please don't boot us to the main menu first. Just drop us straight into the loading screen to cut down on the time.
---
I have been. There’s no option to change it. It constantly says he’s already out looking
---
eso champion points being account wide is always the most friendly thing ive seen in mmos honestly. Also kinda funny cause the lego perks kinda reminded me of the champ stuff
---
I’m definitely going to pay more attention the next time a teammate completes a quest, I’m too easily distracted by caps suddenly popping up so il just have to focus later tonight lol
---
Yes but it will be a atomic shop item only .
---
There are three nuclear silos in Appalachia my guy
---
Okay, and at a set time? I just want to turn in the meat for scrip
---
This should be resolved a little later today, they are working on this right now.
---
I think I would prefer some message to notify me that there were too many players in the event rather than throwing me in a separate instance.
---
It is the ammo collector from the munitions factory duplicated on his camp.
---
Ah. I see. Unfortunately, I do not own a pc. Hey that rhymes.

---
 &gt; This should be resolved a little later today, they are working on this right now.
---
With the fletcher mod you get crazy high damage
---
So these take damage without PvP because they are not legit camp items? I have not tried but am curious
---
Not got around to completing the quest line since I'm concentrating on the score grind
---
I know Overwatch has a PTS. What do they give their players, I’ve never did PTS and Overwatch is the first time I heard of the term PTS so I’m genuinely curious. The only thing I can think of is loot boxes (like atoms it’ll be them “paying” for PTS) or unique PTS only skins (which is like the unique CAMP items I think)
---
Yes, basically it treats every shot in VATS as a critical shot so all pellets hit one spot.
---
I don’t like the idea of atoms being used for in-game mechanics
---
Yes i know but when placed in camp is covered by all yhe same rules as other camp items
---
Fast? Travel bug! Fast travel? Bug! Fast? Travel? Bug! Fast Travel Bug? Fast Travel Bug!
---
Fast.
---
Travel.
---
Bug.
---
Literally lol 
---
Im still learning stuff about this game too, I didn't know there was a glitch to get those machines in your camp until I saw it anyway! &amp; no problem!!
---
Here's the thing though. PvP is like asking someone out on a date, you don't know if they want to PvP or not until you try. You're also going in blind not knowing your opponent so you're going to use your initial advantage. I've gotten into a lot of fun PvP fights contesting workshops from others. Some people like it.
---
Losing a few caps and maybe some junk is a risk you take when you take a workshop. But, that's it. Don't seek revenge and move on. 
---
How many times has it actually happened to you? I take a lot of workshops hoping someone will contest, but I've only had two takers.
---
There’s got to be a coming dominator here because I’ve never gotten the bug and now I’m scared it’s coming lol
---
True...unless you try to fight Earl.
---
Hey, my museum is all built (I might make it bigger in the future as I gather more stuff) if you want join me/ I join you to get the masks for my displays.
---
A L L    C A P S angry man!
---
That’s what I’ve heard, unfortunately I’m on Xbox so who knows when I’ll actually be able to experience it😂
---
The other day it hit me.  People say that the devs, etc. don't play their own game, but it's clear at least some of them do.
---
What I can believe is that they haven't, at least recently, played anyone else's online game.  I play ESO as well, and yeah, Fallout 76 could stand to steal quite a few things.
---
People just like more story and quests, its basically getting dlc like you get in the sp stuff at this point but pricier nowadays cause its the age we are in now.
---
I hear you, I also have 600 unused treasury notes. There might be a lot of new players who aren’t in the same situation as us....
---
Awesome. Thank you. Made it there.
---
Yeah I just got one on the first event, didn't know that a month ago lol
---
Anyone ever have it where it says it's taking u to a new world but keeps u in the same one ,but u can't press ESC or anything to stop it so u have to force close it ,and then u think ok now that I forced closed and back at main menu it should take me to a new world but in fact it doesn't it brings u back to the same gawd dam one ,and the only way to actually get into a new world to play is by joining a friends world.  Shitty thing is this has happened to me when none of my friends are online to join there game so I'm not able to play at all until someone comes online lol annoying as fuk
---
My hero for posting this!
---
That's all he does. Ever. Bitches out people with legitimate complaints and redirects blame to the victim.
---
Very smooth.
---
I was kinda hoping the Meat Tenderizer plan would allow us to craft legendary versions.  This is a bit of a bummer... considering how rare Fixers drop from the world/ purveyor.
---
yep. every hour, on the hour.
---
Can confirm on PS4. Exact same issues and even when I ran it the second time and ran them down asap. The event still timed out after killing the prime beast
---
Oh sorry I misread your comment, yes we were actively in pvp due an explosive round touching each other toes whilst grinding the golf club. Unintentional at the beginning but seeing his ammo collectors made it intentional in the end haha.
---
Of course, you're right. It is a good opportunity for them.
---
Even with a set of ass/sent (which he obviously wasn’t wearing, this dude was using a hazmat suit), not every piece is gonna have every effect proc. Each piece only has a 56% chance for both effects to go off on the same hit, and when they do it’s a 23% decrease. But let’s give the guy the benefit of the doubt and say all his pieces went sentinel procs and two pieces also flipped assassins (which isn’t statistically likely) to stop 91% of all incoming damage. If I’m dealing my 30k damage a hit on this guy, and 91% of that is stopped, that’s still 2,700. There’s no build in the game that can take 2,700 damage straight up like that.
---
I agree with this! Or at least let the challenge be a large weekly one, as having to micro-manage time means all I do each day is the dailies before I have to head off, and it has been over a month since I've actually been able to properly quest and do my own thing!
---
If you bothered to use the search bar, you'd know that the answer is no
---
And no there isnt a release date either
---
Yes, but at least the damage to other player's experience is minimal, unless if you're rude and 1shot everything before anyone else can tag them.
---
No you still have to be active in pvp.
---
And just how did you initiate PvP with them to be able to damage their camp?
---
it's a limited time item, it'll come back at some point and be available for a short time and then leave again.
---
Seems like an unnecessary QoL
---
What? Are people really strapped for caps? Can't handle another loading screen?
---
Might as well make Atlas a free travel point too while we're at it.
---
I’m sorry, I’m on mobile and wasn’t aware there was a search bar. I’ll delete the post.
---
If you hold out you should get the new Brotherhood one for free in a couple weeks.
---
Oh I see, thank you
---
Yep, be there or be square
---
I was probably about a week ahead of schedule and then I left town for a few days and came back to my power being out for another half a week. I'm at rank 88 so still hoping to finish it without paying. 
---
The original layout and timing was pretty tight with little margin for error. The added extra challenges and double score days had made it feel much more forgiving. Now I can skip NW if I prefer not to do those harder ones. Kind of curious to see if they continue next season or if they try to get more people to pay going forward.
---
As others mentioned you were probably the latest to join and thus were put in another instance. I understand why it's done and yet I don't.. The enemy seems harder than SBQ due to no bonus damage, at least for me it is and limiting players by the group of 8 will often leave those 1-2 extra people aside and ofc cause the event to fail with no chance to success like in OP's situation.
---
I never said I was destructive just shutting off every single light to conserve power.
---
I did not see the time... I didn't even know that meat week was out until an hour ago lol,i thought people ha donly started talking about it.
---
Only bad wannabes
---
they're not. 
---
just a heads up, that's the sort of information that would be released on the game's website, as well as on this subreddit. would be pretty much impossible to miss.
---
Just did the cook out event for the first time and we failed it within like 3 minutes.  I was with a rather large group of people who were all high level so I am not sure what we did wrong.  lol.  I went around picking up trash and poop, and then hit the spits all the while watching that bar slowly drop.
---
Exactly. I spend over 5 minutes trying to join 6 different worlds just to give up and play without my CAMP. I have a fixed CAMP
---
Just you wait, season 2 will have 16 times the challenge!
---
Normally on the same side but its optional and has no ingame reward. I'm all for it if they added a cap counterpart.
---
On XB, any time you clear your reserve space for 76, the in-game pics are irretrievably gone.
---
Good lord, thanks! That sounds brutal...
---
I finished yesterday and I already miss it today. It doesn't help that the challenge completion notifications still pop up to remind us that we are earning worthless SCORE. They should stop the notifications or give us some way to convert the extra SCORE into something else.
---
I would hope it brings maybe fusion cells and maybe laser guns, something bos related to differentiate from the other ones
---
Don't know how to link a comment but I pointed this out in an earlier comment. Had an unintentional  tussle that lead to an intentional one.
---
If you actually use it, you'll see that a motherlode transports you through it. You can also go to those locations to get a ride back to The Deep. A motherlode will pop up for you to enter.
---
Your most welcome
---
Yeah, because the rating drops over time, even while you do stuff. You need large donations to push past the steady decline.
---
What are the chances for the unique weapons?
---
And 16 times the amount of auto completed challenges? 💪🏻
---
I've found the traveling merchant asleep in my bed.
---
Yeah, it might not be players.
---
(I always try to be mindful of closing doors, myself).
---
yes the bashing effect makes it magic
---
I don't even bother relaying anymore as I have nothing left to spend caps on, and the loading screens are too damn long.  This is the same reason people don't like using interior cell player homes in FO4 and older games.
---
lol, so many haters.
---
Ok.i usually jump on around 8pm tx time but if I can get on before I'll message you
---
Drinking dirty water is the easiest way. It's easy to collect, and is everywhere on the map.
---
Drink it until you see/hear nerd rage proc at 20% health.
---
That might be a could explain action! Just had it happen again. So far out of 4 attempts, 2 failed at the timer due to no creatures spawning, 1 server disconnect and one that completed upon my joining. It’s been quite a ride.
---
The harpoon gun is fun also.  I put frechette barrel on it and 1 shot everything in vats.  Good times cheap ammo
---
sounds good

---
of course! it was posted yesterday and then again today.
---
You won’t melt the queen with a magic shotgun , but you should easily reach the damage threshold for loot.
---
I'm so overweight it hurts, so when fight queen etc, I swap all weight reduction perks out for damage ones and you can literally stand im front of Queen in power armour and just unload with out dying. Only time I use it.
---
Instigating is also a magic effect.
---
Yeah I'm at the meat cook out now and it seems every one here is illiterate and/or five. Its like encrypted all over again, only with the EASIEST event
---
Yours probably placed the CAMP because there probably wasn't anyone around to trigger the enemy spawn so the game behaved as if they weren't there. It pkaces your CAMP before you (learned that the hard way) so it would pkace your CAMP, you would spawn in, trigger the enemy spawn and they would spawn in the CAMP
---
Every hour top of the hour! 1, 2, 3 etc
---
I've been through this with a friend.  If they want drugs and alcohol,  there's no stopping them.  They have to want to help themselves
---
Seems like a lot of effort to harass people not doing anything to you..
---
Thank you so much
---
I started in the beginning of the season, but it looked like he was alreay at the top of the first curve and heading down when I was still at the beginning.
---
Yeah i am unsure what's happening, had a Meat Cook fail myself....
---
Maybe automatically find a session my camp will pop in by default. Then if I decide to roll the dice and join a friend, that's on me.
---
Awesome!
---
We're leaving that for season 3; after we've conducted enough research on how far we can push our player base.
---
Why though?
---
Yes, you will get a notification and the World Event Icon pop up just south west of Vault 76!
---
The values for more than 1 Bullet may be multiplicative. So if selling 1 is worth 0, 0 x 200 is still 0, and then selling 200 bullets may not be worth anything either.
---
This is a lot of assumption, but given that caps, legendary scrip, and gold all work in whole values it’s entirely possible that the vendor interface was tried and can’t work since it can’t handle these issues with decimals. 
---
To get a bit more technical, the “base case” needs to work just as well as any other case because their system likely depends on the smallest values. You can select 0 and 1 of an item to sell. Let’s say the vendor takes the value of an item and multiplies it by the number of the item you select. 0 items will always sell for 0 caps since any value x 0 is 0. But 1 needs to work, and 1 x a value in the original example will give .8, And 2 will give 1.6. 3 will give 2.4, 4 will give 3.2, and 5 will give 4 points, and 6 would give 4.8 points. This is where it gets really weird. If you are always truncating (cutting off) the decimal, those prices become 1 bullet for 0 points, 2 bullets for 1, 3 for 2, 4 for 3, 5 for 4 and then 6 for 4 again. The values for 5 and 6 bullets (4 points and 4.8 points respectively) would end up the same. I would call up to the first least whole number multiple the base case here, and 5 is then the lowest we can allow to sell without problems.
---
You’d end up with weird quirks of the system, so the lowest increment we can use is the least whole number multiple of the values (5 in this case for .50) any other number of bullets sold results in loss/gain of value that shouldn’t happen. Expanding/ changing the store to handle those issues may fall outside what this dev team has access to in the engine, or outside the scope of what they can do for a seasonal item
---
Mine is Instigating, but I might keep crafting some until I get a Furious.
---
Thats pretty good...we now have 4 possibly 5 if you have fo1st free travel spots and its nice to have them in the north south and west of the map and almost in the middle of the zones aswell. Have a feeling there will be a lot more bog CAMPS being built
---
All I see are failures everywhere, no one goes to prime cuts and when they do they fail often.  Have yet to find a Meat Week that wasn't about to fail or already failed.
---
Sure thing
---
They take like 20 minutes if you don’t know what you’re doing, 5 if you do. I’d recommend doing it.
---
Found this on a search, just to clarify that I have a 33% VATS Gatling laser with no FFR (ROF is 18x) and it still kicks the bug.
---
I have like 5 legendary shovels lol.
---
I’ve never gotten anything from public test servers. The payment has always been experience and knowledge the rest of the players don’t have
---
OK take it back thought I would get a cute cow its a barrel XD
---
Ran into a vending machine with a stack of 50.
---
Is there somewhere that explains what you’re supposed to do at grahms meat cook off? I logged in, went straight to it and had no idea what I was supposed to be doing
---
Yeah no idea what's going on, I'm hoping as folks get home from work and more people jump on that things will improve.
---
[Great Video about the Cookout from last Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kfEji_i7NY)
---
Also Tip on the Greens, its best to have one person collect all or most of them and turn them in all at once. You get more progress that way.
---
FOR THE LAST TIME, YOU'RE NOT GETTING MY SHOVEL!
---
This market manipulation crap goes too far. I already told you that not even the entire collective inventory of your duping discord is enough for my level 25 nocturnal swing speed weight reduced shovel. Enough already!
---
Ooooh nicee ill have to try that.   I let most of my food and flux spoil since for now im just trying to get a decent amount of the other mats to stabalize i think inert flux gives 30 rads same as spoiled foods
---
Nah complete bullshit the atoms were way better
---
Every shotgun is magic as long as you are wearing a piece of armor with the "reduces damage while blocking" legendary.
---
One on character I use a quad, vats critical +50%, 25% less vats cost double barrel.
---
Even a low end vanilla shotgun will be magic, but the more damage the gun can do normally, the more it will do when magic.
---
aww damn i see, okay thanks!
---
Have instigating exploding bullets and some useless perk... vats one shot many enemys.
---
Normal scorchbeast and atleast 1 star legendary scorchbeast in few shots
---
Honestly we were just screwing around and half of us were drunk.
---
Anti armor isn't a damage buff, it's an enemy resistance debuff, so it isn't affected at all. I played around a bit with anti armor on my heavy guns character and it seems to still do about +30% more damage to everything, in a multiplicative sense.
---
So at first pass anti armor looks to be relatively better compared to most legendary effects.
---
Time for an intervention and a support group for the robot I reckon
---
I don't have a picture, but in case you aren't aware it's just a giant wooden keg/barrel (Not a cute cow plushie backpack that I assumed!)
---
Using pressure plates here :-)
---
...do you have seasoning, at least?
---
from the posts on this subreddit, there are a lot of people who are new the event. maybe we should give the newbies a chance to figure out what's going on.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Someone posted that not long ago. It’s pretty easy.
---
well just like encrypted i can solo meat week as well so i couldn't care less what everyone else is doing.
---
If you see quest markers in the distance, don't wait for the beasts to come to you, you'll run out of time while they're stuck out there.
---
Of all the things on the subreddit this!
---
vats is wonky with it.
---
Smacking the molerats...
---
Hopefully that’s it all fixed man!
---
Why?
---
No. You don’t need the mask. The mask is only cosmetic.
---
I am about the same either 89 or 90 and about 6 days ahead.  So with the double and weeklies I should be good.  I never did any NW, but only missed 2 days of dailies.
---
I would be excited for something as simple as another tab in stash called “shared”. It has to go into your stash first and then marked. This could prevent it from being in the world to be available for any kind of duplication exploit. Almost like marking favorite, but marking for shared.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Have the radiation barrels at my camp, for the bloodied players visiting.
---
There's no set bonuses on armor except for Solar and Thorn. There's a legendary perk coming that will change that but it's not available atm. And no I don't believe the Scout Mask would effect it as it doesn't add any damage resistance.
---
How do you solo meat week?
---
We saw similar complaints when it first came out last year. After the first day everybody figures it out.
---
Wait a minute so you have 2 shotgun* characters?
---
I am against Making crafting account wide..  they should just let bound items transfer between characters but not the crafting part
---
true, was the same thing last time and after 2-3 days nearly every meatweek event i attended succeeded
---
How does one sit around at encrypted? I stop moving that sheep is on me in a heartbeat
---
Completely agree it’s one of the reasons I was hesitant to buy the game, I haaaaate games that support micro transactions. Good to see that it’s cosmetic stuff atleast
---
I like my story better 😉
---
Have you calculated how many atoms you've gained through the entire run? It's not half-bad! And keeps things interesting at the very least, though I'd like less of a micro-management daily grind, and more so at your own pace weeklies/monthlies.
---
Talking about the pylons
---
I didn’t think you could pvp below level 5.
---
First vats shot basically always misses, even at 95%.
---
Sometimes they won't reload and/or you will have to switch weapon from pipboy after you equip it.
---
So, basically, they are ridden with bugs at the moment. 😐
---
And the messed up part is that it makes it difficult for someone to catch up if they constantly get it. Then at that point are forced to pay to catch up (assuming they want to finish at all costs). They also have the audacity to not reimburse and release a new season with the same exact problem.
---
That really a shady thing to do
---
1. It's not as big as it was. The Residential section is completely blocked off, as is much of the second floor of Engineering and the generator rooms.  
---
The pumps and pump control rooms are completely removed for some reason, not even a sign to indicate where they were.  
---
The map's also been heavily moved around, to the point it's slightly disorienting if you've memorized the old one.  
---
Oddly the collapsed section of the GECK chamber seems to have been expanded.  
---
2. The same ones from last time, though again, with Residential blocked, I haven't found replacements for the terminal data from in there.  
---
3. That's really up to you, but I've certainly been enjoying them. They're kind of Vault 94-lite. Not as mechanics focused, but it's still more important to worry about the clock than the enemies.  
---
That said, with an efficient gun, it could turn into a good means of farming ammo. With my .50 Cal, for example, I'm actually turning a mild profit when I come out there.
---
I know that sometimes an enemy will spawn away from where creatures normally spawn. Happen in Heart of the Swamp usually a mirelurk would spaw up the hill like 20m from the edge of the cliff behind some trees and no one moves to get it usually.
---
Or give us console players the chance I play hours a day I would gladly test the game to make it better for everyone.
---
easy you grab all the greens and collect meat while you put out fires and clean up  it's not super tough
---
edit: the drums and spits are not necessary to finish they do help but can't do that when you solo
---
So are there any new rewards?
---
You can't solo when other kill and take the meat from critters and don't know what to do with it lol
---
Ahhh gotcha. To be honest if I’m on my full health char I prefer them to just let me take all 3 so we can keep her visible rather than constantly having people downed.
---
Very entertaining write up 👏
---
Should you choose to, look up recommended builds and gear to be able to take them out in one hit or in ~1 second of firing. This is possible without sneaking even.
---
Bloodied is still the best for raw damage, but Anti-Armor ends up being pretty decent because a lot of the higher-level enemies are, predictably, using higher DR/ER which is countered by AA.  I'd say if you aren't doing Bloodied or Junkies, AA is a good third option.
---
Timers too short,spawns take too long to load,  spawn area too large, and waves don't coalesce and stay out the edges.
---
As for the cookout the decay is absurd, I have seen 4 people constantly active and it still fell.
---
What does the meat tenderizer do?
---
Nice! Speaking of quest items, am I still able to keep the flower centerpiece from Distinguished Guests? I've been wanting one for my display case and I'm not sure how to get one if I even can
---
I could...but I can also realize that it’s a poorly implemented experience...and this isn’t Myst.
---
Didn't read it yet because I don't know if I read it if it will drop or not again
---
Big deal: if you see someone just turning the spits or playing music, they ARE contributing constantly, don't bug them. They may even be helping while AFK.
---
Yes!!! A way to get a legendary Tenderizer. They listened.
---
Stop making sense.
---
Same as fasnacht. On the hour
---
You're a good man. But the point is that not one person should have to activate all pylons thats why it's called a public event.
---
I was in the Cranberry Bog and it prevented the final spawn. Boom. Failed
---
The event rewards are each like 9% chance this time (for 100% successful event) not super rare like previous events have been so it should be pretty easy to get everything.
---
What?!
---
See, I actually like the Cursed stuff, I'd just like to see it expanded and maybe "grandfathered" as it were.
---
Add similar things to the Queen's drop list, for example. Maybe a "prototype" series of heavy guns and rifles, themed off the Brotherhood. Improved damage, improved rate of fire, faster durability loss, maybe they come with a Prime Receiver already installed and then three specific legendary effects.
---
The Cursed weapons show an idea that can really be built upon.
---
nobody will sit there while the nuke drops on their camps :(
---
Is ur name after dino trucks lol just wondering
---
The elm trees
---
Question about treasury notes, how far into the wastelanders questline do you need to be in order to start getting them?
---
your backlog of prime meat doesn't have anything to do with what other people are doing.
---
"There not forcing you to..." isn't a related argument. Nobody is literally saying they're taking control of players, they're saying a structure was developed that only pays out under contrived circumstances that requires an investment of time playing outside of individual agency/interest.
---
The point is product engagement, not dictating play. Active &amp; frequent engagement should be rewarded moreso than adherence to publisher-specified play.
---
I have two characters. 
---
A Full heath Sent/AssJunkie Commando Tank and a Bloodied PA Melee/Big Guns. 
---
I rarely die as it is but the PA character just laughs at all incoming damage bar Poison in PvE. PA with its normal Damage reduction + Lone Wanderer + Emergency Protocols + Richocher and Blocker makes you insanely tanky, with Dodgy adding even more to it. 
---
PVP wise, PA will always be lacking until it gets reworked or some legendary effects. You can cheese some great Jetpack+Stealthboy+Quants and just fly around with a legacy though and do fine for just murdering people.
---
No, because I've had my main account logged in and that character nearby watching my alt account's camp spawn in before. The enemies start fighting the turrets before the turrets are even visible.
---
I've also had my one account standing in the camp spot and had the other account's camp spawn in around me.
---
In the hundreds of times I've brought my alt onto my private server I've only ever gotten the can't place message once and it was because I put my tent there and forgot to move it before logging the other account on.
---
Potential legendary at the end
---
[Here's the latest on it that I saw.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/icwzdg/werent_legendary_perks_shared_across_characters) looks like they changed their position before
---
I know that but I can’t hand it in if the event isn’t on
---
Well, you've seen it in action lol :-)
---
I do what I want. Deal
---
Same. But then it’s my first one and I was the only one there so who knows if I fucked it up.
---
Take Rad-X then fast travel. It just works. Seriously it does work.
---
Probably to get people to stop doing nothing but non stop SBQ
---
I was a little bummed too but it looks good with the bloody chefs outfit n hat then add a bloody chefs rolling pin im loving it
---
Because it represents an unfair advantage and probably breaks Bethesdas Ts and Cs.
---
Text chat is very difficult to add to the game
---
Definitely this best way, rare stuff should be locked behind events you can grind indefinitely not just get lucky
---
It's just a unique two handed melee weapon
---
Spoken like a true enclave. Lol.
---
I'd take 20 spoiled meat over  a stack of chef hats anyway.
---
Okay I see what you mean now. Did one cook out. But a lot of the primal cuts are failing. Tons of people at each one, but the final wave isn’t finishing or the enemies aren’t showing up
---
yeah, I know how Meat Week works.
---
I may be in the minority but I actually appreciate the toughness of the event. RUN!
---
Sitting on around 1200, working my way for the final 2 pieces of T65 pa..
---
Already bought leg upgrades i needed.
---
So this event will be very usefull
---
Turn it in right away instead of waiting for the event to fail?
---
I really like the design of the Sharp Pickaxe but its default skin is pretty ugly. Thankfully the Atom Shop Skins for it are great.
---
It’s been two hours I still don’t understand and judging by your downvotes I’m assuming I’m not the only one
---
This seems to be the issue. I've had to walk 50 meters out to kill stuck spawned enemies to progress the waves
---
Thanks so much, I just tried to jump in and the was confused
---
At least some asshole can't run in with a hacked weapon and instakill the event after I spent 2k on a recall card and took all the pylons.
---
Meat.
---
Then more meat.
---
Then even more meat.
---
Now, you should be good.
---
Bloodied, 33% vats hit chance (magic effect) and +250 dr on reloading
---
That’s a good start , fallout first is incredible for junk storage alone I don’t think I could live without it these days
---
Doesn't that sort of thing usually release on Tuesdays?
---
Well now I'm opening all the doors I find in any camp I find  for the slim chance of you being the victim of my door openings
---
It would make people completely change tactics
---
Yep had one fail again!
---
Hehe it is a bit manic the first time but once you know what you’re doing it easy.
---
Never mind, thought the meat tenderizer was different from the tenderizer plan
---
What are fireworks good for?
---
Sweet Roll, Formula P or Grape Mentats, Alcohol, Hard Bargain. Also you can share Magnetic Personality on a team for up to +2 Charisma per teammate excluding yourself.
---
On Ps4 - issues with Social list also.
---
No disconnects - but it does act up. 
---
Quite often we fail the event as either the boss doesn't show up, or does but the kill doesn't register.
---
Excellent!!
---
Sorry I wouldn’t know. I’ve been a little out of the loop
---
I love my Refrigerator Backpack mod, my perishables last for weeks.
---
The problem is by the time I get there it has failed
---
Cannot upvote enough, had too many games where it leaves me in the same world during server hopping. This game is awesome and has so much potential but not without its issues.
---
The toughness is fine. I can completely tank enemy hits and revive my teammates to give them that sweet shared Revenant 2\*. The problem is that the stagger is just annoying and doesn't really do anything else besides annoy.
---
That's a reward coming with Project Bravo :)
---
I carried a crap one that had 90WR on it before but then someone dropped a Cursed one in front of the Scrip machine, glad to have one i can actually use for Melee now.
---
Yep learning that the hard way....
---
This is intentional. Every wave you will be detected. My guess it’s too stop people from one-two hitting everything.
---
Yeah I was just curious of mainly the damage output. If bloodied is only doing 20-30 more damage per shoot than AA, I’d personally rather run high health and be tanky instead of running less than 20% health.
---
Also, slow firing weapons are supposedly going to be effected quite a bit by the upcoming nerf people are talking about in the PTS.
---
Never had this on pc, lvl 96 just today, im not online during reset and thats all. Mule account is 70
---
Think he mean that people see his vendors on map but ive you would travel to his camp you wont see Them out in the open.
---
Ive had that a few Times Buth then i would glitch trough the Doors untill i found Them.
---
But encouraging alts would make them more money. I don't want to buy anything from the atomic shop now because my main character's camp is perfect and almost at full budget. For example, I only bought the RR Garage because I made a 2nd character and wanted a prefab instead of building a place just to save time. Would've never bought it otherwise.
---
You commandeered his native lands, and built your collecters on the graves of his ancestors!
---
Next time, you should be more understanding of his history and culture.
---
Thanks for all the info and putting up with me lol think I’m finally understanding it all
---
Nothing happened to it, it's still scheduled to be an upcoming reward as always.
---
To be fair, I've played other games that literally tell you what to do on screen as it's happening and people still fail event miserably.
---
Get there quicker then! It's every hour. Be ready.
---
And also how are people failing this have managed 3/3 no problem.
---
I...never said they weren't? That is part of "what to do" part...
---
Oh really? I was so certain that they showed it as a reward from fortifying atlas. 
---
Oh well thanks
---
If it won't complete then hop servers. It's probably an older server and is now over loaded. I just hopped and mines working fine now
---
I did it y-day on a alt
---
Which are the "hardest" regions of the map? To maximize the amount of meat I can get.
---
I hear that.
---
But having no instructions at all doesn't help either.
---
They cut weapon reload time in half. Equip a weapon, unequip/reequip fireworks, and presto: your gun now reloads twice as fast! It's fixed on the PTS though, so this won't last long.
---
I love my Chally The Moo Moo mask
---
yes, I am.
---
Blocking doesn’t work the way people think it does , porkchop and Safire followed me for days and they weren’t my friends,  blocked them server hopped reported them nothing actually works if griefers wanna hunt you down they can it’s ridiculous bethesda even pretends blocking works , you have to report harassment to Sony if you wanna get people to leave you alone
---
If it fails you didn’t kill them all. Sometimes they get stuck down cliffs or in the trees and you have to go find them
---
I think that's what they did with the beret and the banner pole. Hopefully it will be available next week :)
---
Oh okay cool cool. 
---
I was just certain that they showed it as a reward from fortifying atlas. 
---
Happy to help! Last year I was clueless and had a lot of help so, this is my chance to help out too!
---
I'm that guy with the Gatling laser so I'm sure that it looks like a rave when I'm repeatedly getting staggered and i just keep my finger on the trigger
---
Does it do 20% more damage than a gauss shotgun without the exploding effect?
---
People need to also start listening to Grahm. He is literally telling you what to do. 
---
It’s not just idle banter.
---
Yea. Maybe they could have u battle a hive in the forest region as a mini boss fight for newer players? Not a bad idea
---
Dammit, I love this glitch with the Tesla Rifle. The mag empties so fast, and reloads so slow without it.
---
Bethesda still don't understand how demoralizing it is not having the final reward shared among all participants.
---
Either that or they are just stubbornly sticking to their script despite everything to the contrary.
---
Yeah, the outfit, collectron, purveyor sale and second meat weak are all coming later.  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ONfnoj0Ui3AmUEwBF0wFp/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-activities-in-appalachia](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ONfnoj0Ui3AmUEwBF0wFp/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-activities-in-appalachia)
---
Awesome. 
---
I panicked a little cause i know they were set on a timer for us to collect in the store lol. Thanks!
---
Edit.
---
I would assume you just bank them until you complete the Wastelanders questline (entering Vault 79)!
---
weeklies don't get doubled. only dailies.
---
You don't get double score on the weeklies, only the dailies
---
*reloads rifle* STAGGER *reloads rifle again* STAGGER *reloads rifle again again* STAGGER :3
---
yes, that's correct. the event isn't over.
---
Weeklies aren’t affect by the double score, it’s only the dailies that are.
---
Haha I don't blame ya, it's definitely something you don't want to miss
---
If you pick the locks on something, you get a bounty and are open to PvP.
---
Hey to be fair maybe a radroach left the door open. Honestly one of things I loved about Outer Worlds is animals can’t open doors.
---
Is there a certain quest line you have to have done before you can start it?
---
Molerats and radscorpions also seem to get stuck underground sometimes or travel far away to “hide”. Like in Heart or the Swamp if everyone is in the cliff some enemies will book it and hide behind the trees.
---
Ooooh so fortifying atlas has more stages??
---
The gauss shotgun is so powerful that it's effective in the hands of any character.
---
There is a bug with them that makes you reload super fast.
---
So he's turned into Bender for Futurama lol.
---
lol, yeah, good point...I just assumed it was working as intended, I didn't know it was doing like a super-crit everytime
---
A pennant is like a flag thingy.
---
I gave up bc no work to damn much and didn’t have time
---
It just started working after about an hour. Friends list is there and I've joined someone.
---
Yeah I've got an instigating combat shotgun and it's fucking ridiculous. One-shot almost everything in VATS
---
Exactly haha. 
---
Free collectron. Yes please XD
---
People are still asking if Meat Week is active. I doubt instructions would help much.
---
I'm sure I could talk Butcher Pete into applying our Spice Rub :-)
---
Thanks a lot, I can't understand why they removed residential section, I think there was some terminal there! Pump section I don't care, not interesting. Well I hope there will be more lore, I just  pick a holotape
---
Alas blocking players doesn't stop the game from matching you with their server!
---
Cranberry Relish and Brain Fungus Soup make herbivore so worth it... especially with the upcoming changes to stacking damage buffs
---
Not a bug, it's a feature!
---
Search this sub for a calculator on the run, it’s a github thing.  You can fill in relevant info and see if you are going to make it, plus there is a bonus week added and double score weekend right now.  I think you may be close but for the love of the mothman, save your atoms for the very end to buy levels!  Each level costs 25 more than the last!
---
Agreed, ‘‘tis is my first meat week and I have no idea what’s going on. I’ve failed 3 out of 5 Primal Cuts. I tried watching videos but they weren’t very helpful...
---
***Event Full! Do you wish to try for a new instance?***
---
sometimes people drop it where the dirt you use to fill the grave spawns and the next guy is unable to pick it up.
---
This affects no in game mechanics, it just adds a text message
---
I said in another thread that regular explosives need to be used more. My proposal, all fissures need a mission to kill all scorchbeasts and to close the hole with regular explosives. This is temporary of course and they open again. SBQ event needs the same thing . After killing the queen, fissure prime needs to be closed with regular explosives. Great way to use nades, mini nukes, missioes etc.
---
Oooh so fortifying atlas has more stages?
---
I think I have totally misunderstood the event then!
---
Oh yeah, I forget consoles have their own thing on top of the friends list in game. That's not okay.
---
It could be worse. Those star citizen backers became delusional at this point.
---
The one in the shop is clean. This one is dirty from what i have heard.
---
That would be helpful therefore it has not been implemented 😁
---
I've had them spawn far with no tents in the area
---
The stagger is a pain in the ass, but the Wendigo screams are *way* too frequent because of the number of spawns. It's hell to listen to.
---
you have 2X dailies the next 4 days, as well as bonus challenges next week. 
---
You should be able to make it if you're doing all your challenges daily.
---
Finally a real krogan!
---
That would be perfect!
---
Lmao why are so many of you players so toxic bout this? Just close the fuckin door. You do it every time you leave your house.
---
yep, 4 stages in part 1, 4 stages in part 2.
---
I don't think I've ever laughed this hard but I completely agree 🤣🤣
---
Whatever. Every damn Prime Cuts I go to there's some asshole with an OP gun melting the legendaries before anyone else has a chance to shoot. If they want to do all the work they can do all the fucking work.
---
I could care less about them in workshops but I'd like it patched. Joining private teams is pretty iffy now because of it.
---
Oh, TIL, didn't know that word. Will probably be a recolor of the vault-tec university one from NW reward event last year.
---
No one is talking about player experience and damage done in vats. You argument was vats doesn't belong in pvp because it's an aimbot. Mine is that if you think that you, should be against it in pve because mobs are way to easy to kill in this game and an aimbot is an aimbot.
---
Yes and sometimes cleaning the piles of poo and bones makes no ding or advancement.
---
Probably network lag like so much in this game.
---
5 times failed so far.
---
Twice it started again when it failed and immediately failed again. The fuck is this shit?
---
How are we supposed to supply prime meat?
---
I am level 382 now, when I hit level 300 I decided to just play the game since I had bought all the new armor and weapons that came with Wastelanders.   As far as the Legendary Run I just get what I can on double weekends.  With that I am three spots ahead of Capt Cosmos and will most likely finish this season with no problem after this double.
---
Where do you have your camp? It might just be a very popular spot and it actually is changing the server. It's either find a less popular spot or stay and deal with it. Not trying to be rude, it's just how it is.
---
You suck and your mom is a whore, that's why.
---
Seriously, yeah some people just like to sow chaos and misfortune.  Stow your junk often, or do what I do and creep around the wasteland in stealth mode with invisibility armor.
---
Make a honey beast queen and an underground hive
---
How does one get one to stay in your inventory.  I want one in my camp display .
---
I leveled up until i could start Wastelanders , then started focusing on the Settler quests . Was not so bad even though im no fan of replaying story quests
---
there's no air conditioning, he's probably just trying to get a crossbreeze going
---
What bugs me is that it happens to some people a lot, and some (like myself) have only had it one time, or even none.
---
When does season 1 end? Some sites say Mid-September but I cant find an exact date.
---
Maggie, that selfish elvil bitch!
---
Stop being a pickeled bitch
---
Is it out on Xbox?
---
XP per level does not increase after the soft cap.
---
Odds are any on screen instruction they would try and insert would pop up five minutes after the event completes
---
If we are in public groups and other group members are detected by enemies, stealthed group members will also be detected.
---
Same here, its like a safety blanket you can't totally give up.
---
Thanks. Didnt wanna waste the gold on it, if it did nothing for my sponge effect!!!
---
Nothing with the Raiders. She's not part of their storyline, so she's still out there.
---
Stabilized, and also because I like the feel of power armor. Even though it’s inferior to the Secret Service armor I have. 
---
You still see lots of PA in big events because PA is much easier to access than a top tier set of legendary armor. You don’t need to worry about good RNG, just get a set/build one. And you’re good to go. Fusion Cores are almost impossible to run out on. 
---
PA does have the downside of requiring more perk investment. Where as normal armor can be the opposite and allow you to free up perks. Say a full set of weight reduction armor would allow you to carry dozens of all weapon types without speccing into those perks.
---
As someone who did for the first time it just seems like a wave event with nothing else to do. I don’t see no cow.
---
This is good for returning players, like me, stop saying about your 500 notes ppl
---
I think I might of missed my atoms this month too. Is there anyway to check?
---
Literally nothing. It does not play into the Raider quest at all.
---
It's the last thing you unlock in the wastelanders storyline.
---
No sorry...
---
You didn't 😢
---
That gets a down vote.  Can you mail me one?
---
So I would still be able to use her to fast travel as I currently can?
---
It is a Power Armor Glitch. It does nothing for them. The game can visually glitch sometimes.
---
I have one character that I purposely get a wanted level by various means. Then I just go walking the old highways to see who can kill me. The reactions I get when they see a crazed Secret Service armored killer. Priceless.
---
Damnit I want to be the good guy but keeping motherlode is tempting
---
It’s failed for me three times in a row.  Looks like Fallout 1st tents are breaking the event.
---
I've honestly never tried since I finished the storyline.
---
Baahahah!
---
I see now.. thanks man!
---
Full Unyielding, Carnivore Mutation, Broiled Scorchbeast Brain, Berry Mentats, and last Radiation Rumble.
---
It's best to try and all join at the same time. I had two friends get stuck in one by themselves. We were actually able to fast travel to them and join their instance. Managed to finish it right before running out of time but I didn't get the event rewards.
---
I couldn't find the collection for the critter meat, where is that?
---
You don’t receive them until you complete the quest lines
---
They have said many times they don't currently know how to fix it. It sucks, trust me i know. Maybe one day they'll learn how to fix the issues in the game they developed.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but are you in Power Armor when trying to access the spits?
---
that's food build - damn
---
Are they killing her pretty fast?  The dmg you need to do is 1000 to be able to get rewards for event and loot from her
---
I am on xbox and getting disconnected like crazy. I tried contacting customer support and it was no help. Did you try resetting the connection how about switching from wired to wireless...it was a joke talking to them.
---
It's about to get nerfed to hell, sadly.

---
 &gt; Thank you for telling me. I'll raise this as well.
---
Thanks for the clarification :)
---
Well if your on xbox maybe swing by all I sell is junk.😁
---
What exactly is your 1400 caps in 10 minutes route? 
---
because that amount of caps takes me a lot longer to make and I do not enjoy spending my time focusing on getting caps
---
Jumkies- sounds like doge 😂
---
I’m seeing a bigger issue with the primal cuts failing half the time. Final wave doesn’t seem to be finishing, or they don’t even show up
---
No, just nothing happens, no prompts or anything
---
That would be because you did Primal Cuts, not the main Cookout Event.
---
September 8th is the expected end-date. There is no officially announced end-date. 
---
The Run was described as being a 10 week long event, which would have it ending on September 8th.
---
It's been broken for me since February, NGL.
---
It was fixed within about 30-45 min👍
---
Actually, if you go to the Deep, you can still access the Motherlode for free fast travel.
---
Reduced weight gamma gun works quite well and is also handy for PvP.
---
Do you have to be level 50 to start Wastelanders?
---
Breach and clear event still happens regardless of the choice.
---
Mantis shrimps
---
No.
---
I've heard it's been rough on PC too
---
You get exactly 0 notes rewarded during events until you complete a portion of wastelanders. OP wants to know what quest you complete to unlock note drops.
---
Same here. I'm mad when there isn't one. I'm like damnit! Usually is but still.
---
I switched from bloodied to junkies like 200 levels ago and I don't miss it at all. Fucking love junkies (pa heavy gunner)
---
Don't listen to hard to people talking about the nerf. Everything is getting nerfed junkies will still be second best
---
Oooooh.
---
I have a couple of those on someone IIRC. 
---
Never thought about trying to display it!
---
You complete the event and ONLY get Treasury Notes? No ammo, flux, etc.? That seems very strange.
---
Might be FO1st tent related
---
No, of you can save them do that. I played last year with out the refrigerator back pack mod and most of what I couldn't donate would spoil before the next one. May be different now, spoilage wise but the rewards are meaningless after your 15 meat donation. Just try to keep things going for 100 percent completion, that ups the drop chance for stuff.
---
I keep getting booted each time I join one. Happened twice.
---
Is it placing it in a different stat?  Running a new-sh character - leveled, chose a rifle perk card and it raised charisma?  WTF? Realized I have 5 Char and one char card.  ticket submitted.
---
West Tek, Huntersville, general steak house. End In Harpers just in case your a little short
---
Unfortunate
---
No :)
---
If that's the location with an old metro cart, that was probably me :D
---
I'll give it a go, thanks
---
If you're going to humblebrag, please tell us your level/weapon/build.
---
Anybody able to help me out with a private server ? PSN: DkYungBreezyXx_ appreciate any help I can get !
---
I had one fail randomly, time ran out while nothing spawned. So something is occasionally out of whack.
---
The loot dropped is usually random and doesn't match what they are carrying. Cultists as a whole seem to drop the least of any mob I've encountered lately.
---
Either the bug is fixed, or they wont be in season 2, imo.  It makes the dragon useable
---
I like that approach! And how you brought the emitter and shower together, both switched. Thanks for sharing.
---
Where do you turn in the meat?
---
I haven't done many of those yet but the few I've done have been ok. I've heard there are issues however.
---
I havnt had one fail yet
---
I'm not humble bragging, not even actually bragging. Glad you completely missed the point of my post. 🙄
---
I got so close to finishing the run without it ever happening to me, but of course I got nailed on square 96. Still finished Tuesday, though.
---
It’s cause that’s a “magic” weapon
---
And then I heard the thump, thump, thump of a mirelurk hatchling at my feet as I fought the SBQ.
---
Hi there - can you set this up so we can make a copy?  I like to be able to track what I've gotten and what's still left to go!
---
It absolutely is a related argument. I was replying directly to the comment. I didn’t choose to use that word he did. And getting rewards for logging in isn’t active and frequent engagement. Just like camping in NW isn’t active and frequent engagement. 
---
But if you actually would have thought about it rather than try to sound intelligent, you might have realized that having to log in daily for challenges IS active. And spending time completing the varied challenges IS engagement. Your defending him, but he’s complaining about the level of engagement. He literally endorses logging in to get a level. 
---
So please in the future if your worried so much about related arguments stay on point.
---
If you’re deep enough into resources, you can just take another serum to get the negative effect suppression. I do it with Empath in PvP all the time.
---
If uranium fever is up I just do it instead. Walk my encumbered butt to white spring station
---
It has indeed
---
I just had it fail on me after clearing the final wave, this is ridiculous. You'd think there wouldn't be this many issues with an event they've had in the game *three times now*
---
I'd settle for Neighborly as a compromise. Late enough that you have to work for it but early enough that you can still benefit from it in the long run.
---
Yeah, I've run into bugs in the dark at my house, too. I wasted an entire LMG drum mag of .308 the last time. I always put my gun away, now.
---
Oh and I missed. I had to pull out my shock baton to kill it (which I carry as pest control for weak enemies as not to waste ammo).
---
Did it release for console?
---
Yep. You'll see primal cuts event pop up at a few different areas for different levels. Then the meat week event is hourly I believe that pops up close to vault 76.
---
On xbox as well.
---
What will? Junkies or "magic" effect?
---
Hi mate I got a private world add me at stormer133 on ps4 I'll help u out to morrow at like 10 am England time
---
Tip: Turn in the Plants and Critter Guts in large batches rather than small batches at a time.
---
yes. and in true bethesda style it's bugged. more than half the prime cuts fail despite everything being killed. i expect it'll get extended.
---
Yea exactly, and that’s farther than I’ve been able to get. For me it just fails immediately after the 4th wave creatures spawn.
---
Did you do Fasnacht? It's timed like that.
---
It's not "safe". The one time it hit me, I didn't log in until 2 hours after the reset and was slammed with 6/9 dailies complete. No one is safe.
---
Same here, I’ve only finished it once then we beat the big primal and it says “Finish Last Wave” and no more animals show up and we fail. No CAMPS or tents in the area. I’m getting super frustrated.
---
Happened to me on xbox about 3 times now.
---
This is a way that actually seems possable
---
Only one time she was killed fast, I was there for the beginning of all 3 so pretty sure I contributed my fair amount of damage which is why it's weird &amp; aggravating. :)
---
I didn't get my atoms either. I'm warning everyone to stay away from it all. This game is the worst good game ever. For Honor is 4 years old and that's getting more love from ubisoft than bethesda is giving their 2 year old game. It's a crying shame for consumers everywhere.
---
Boo I got really excited because that was what I was hoping for! Thanks for letting me know.
---
Ugh, that's so stupid. I wish I was surprised, but that's Bethesda for ya 🙄
---
So weird. It can’t be totally random and there’s a large amount of messages right after reset and very few after an hour or so till the next day.
---
If you don’t want fallout to be full of crybabies, why are you acting like one
---
Turned out it was cause I was level 50 but yea that did happen to me a few times prior to 50
---
Yeah! I hat that change. So immersion breaking. Don't know how people couldn't find him when there was a quest marker. All they needed to do was to fix some bugs.
---
"I just soloed a primal cuts (one with the sheepsquatch, wasn't hard"
---
that wasn't bragging?
---
very strange indeed....get no flux or anything, just a legendary weapon and treasury notes
---
What about the Overseer's home and eventually ATLAS?
---
Oh that? It will be fixed soon, they already patched it on PTS
---
Look at that tiny cute mattress... ok no
---
Yeah someone already said it’s fixed in the PTS, shame. I’ve seen that ground pounder works with black powder rifles, not sure about the dragon. That could have been fixed from the last time I’ve seen it, though.
---
No, you wet sock, it wasn't. I threw that out there to hopefully avoid dickheads like you commenting on my post to try and say it's "not hard" to solo primal cuts. And yet, I get an asshole commenting anyways, completely missing the point of my post. 🙄
---
Are you kidding? I could do that with a tato and you’re trying to demand weapon and build? I’m guessing you haven’t spent much time in 76, because even my 9 charisma Berserker build kills Sheepsquatch in seconds. 
---
Killa... imagine being Bethesda and botching an event you’ve run in the game twice before.
---
Supposedly no.  Speed demon is max speed though some say squad maneuvers stack with it (I’m not convinced)
---
Actually I don't think it should have been in the game at all.
---
&gt;Just because it was in the game from the start doesn't make it a good choice.
---
I thought this maybe hinted at that. If it must be in the game, then being restricted to PvE is more tolerable.
---
I'm on Xbox and I havnt got flux or repair kits for past few weeks.
---
Thank you for clearing that up
---
I roll with several junkie's builds and they are fantastic.  I am currently a junkie commando but  I have a shot gun and archer build as well.  Welcome to the club!
---
Hopefully the colossal problem event delays don’t  become a trend with the future BOS dlc. I won’t be able to go on YouTube without spoilers being a console player. Console players matter you know Bethesda!
---
I might be a ble to spare a a few wepons and gear
---
Thank you for telling me. I'll raise this as well.
---
That's a shame. "Endgame Grind" sounds just as dumb as "Surprise Mechanics" to me
---
I gave up on this.
---
On PS4—I’ve done about 12 primal cuts and maybe successfully completed 4 or 5? We kill the last wave but the clock just keeps counting down and we fail. And now Mothman didn’t show up after Path to Enlightenment. Hmm hmm HMMMM
---
Do people even get banned for owning hacked weapons? I still see M2s and Handmades with the laser splitter constantly during colossal problem. With the occasional explosive plasma rifle.
---
Nah, because I'd rather have the atoms.
---
r/unexpectedcuckold
---
It was a thing since fallout 4, while ago lol
---
People like junk with minimal effort so they raid workshops and usually target low levels. Only time I scrap or destroy stuff is if people act like a jackass. I've had people throw all sorts of slurs and other stupid insults on a few occasions. That said I rarely attack anyone under level 100 because I would rather have a good fight. Workshops are about the only place people can initiate PvP without others shooting back, so they usually go for players there. If people are a good sport and fight back I usually drop stims or ammo that is more valuable than whatever I lost. I usually leave their junk as well unless they are doing something particularly stupid.
---
PS4 here
---
Cranberry Bog hardest, Forest easiest
---
I don't know, but here are some thoughts. 
---
Speed Demon allows you to move at the max speed the game will allow (ref: AngryTurtle). Sleek increases movement speed while sneaking. So as long as you don't expect to be able to move faster than the max speed (as when running with Speed Demon) then there seems no reason why there shouldn't be an increase to sneak speed.
---
Yea just like ^ said ... take your time ! Exploitation is the key and doing missions a lot , but you will get to a point to where you gotta choose sides I.e. Raiders / Settlers ... but that’s a ways into the game but keep it in mind as you go alone so you don’t go to far with one faction and then miss missions with the other ya dig ?
---
Bethesda should do what they did with the Scorchbeast Queen.  Several times I have died only to spawn near the fight without having to choose. This just seems a bit sloppy but that is Bethesda for you.
---
Beater
---
*TELL ME ABOUT IT WE'VE DONE THIS EVENT TWICE BEFORE WHAT IS THE DEAL*
---
I have completed the event a few time and got no flux.  On two runs I had that happen but still got loot from the queen on one I had something similar to you happen
---
Mine happens every time in Poseidon.
---
Welcome, excuse the colourful language :-)
---
So why not have a mechanism so that the date doesn't have to be a blind date?
---
I propose a mechanism that can remove the blind to date effect for those who don't like it. Under my terms the person who evaluated you and "started the fight" Is someone you can evaluate in turn before deciding to engage. Both people have a means of giving affirmative consent.
---
And look at the guy who talks about deliberately grieving people here in this thread elsewhere.
---
To continue your date analogy, when somebody 10 times your level comes by it's more like date r@@@@... It's kind of statutory to have someone at level 500 take out your level 70 from behind while you're in the stash box menu.
---
Hhhm that’s something to think about.
---
1,500 every 3 months. You'd get somewhere around 6k every 3 months. Pretty bad, especially considering:
---
&gt; If you don't want to spend money in the Atomic Shop for cosmetic stuff, you don't have to. We give you a shitload of Atoms just for playing the game.
---

---
I'm just disappointed that we've received exactly ZERO updates on when us Console folks will get the hotfix.
---
At this point, I'm betting it won't be until next Tuesday - at the standard time.
---
Always worse during events I find, especially in popular areas.
---
OFFS, Beth.  At least create a warning that you have a different skill selected than the card.  I never knew this was even possible.
---
That’d be greatly appreciated friend
---
Dont forget to stock scrip on characters before purveyor sale tho, 50%
---
One time I came across a camp who locked their vendor behind a skill 3 lock door. Wasted 3 bobby pins, took the wanted only to find that they were selling like 50 fasnacht masks. What a waste
---
Went back recently by accident at a place you can travel to with Motherlode, while encumbered and on foot. Was surprised it digged up from ground so I took a ride back to that commie lair ( as I thought offloading crap in Whitespring should be fastest ). As it breaks in quest with Settlers, I wasnt aware it's still there in the world.
---
I'm done with faction quests for long time now, and am an ally with both factions, just to clarify.
---
I think if they allowed this, it would be a Fallout 1st feature. I doubt Bethesda would even create a multi character stash, we can just hope.
---
He's been there every time I run into the area, constantly. Been using that to server hop, hoping to finally get the mirror ball
---
PTS doesn't allow for actually claiming the rewards.  Can't be tested with the way the PTS is currently set up.
---
Can’t help but wonder how many people on here who read threads and complain about not getting this and that from FO1st will read all these threads and actually do something about the problems they are causing. Somehow I doubt much will give a Pooh about everyone else. 
---
And before you whine about being a FO1st hater, I have FO1st, but have the decency and respect for all players not to muck up events and so forth.
---
No tents the 3 times it failed. I could be blind but you'd think how they throw the animals all across that area you'd see a tent. If that's the true cause..
---
That weapon is bugged, does ~4x the damage intended.  So...might be fixed and then you will not feel so OP.
---
Then again, it's been bugged forever and Beth has not fixed it so who knows?  Enjoy, I suppose
---
Nah, just you. No one else posting about it.
---
Not sure a 50 cal can get the magic effect.
---
That was never a meat week reward. It's a rare drop from normal forest events.
---
Its find I'll be on at 10 am English time so sorry if your American but if be happy to spare some gear still
---
I don't remember that but I will concede it's been forever since I played 4.   I dont recall them exploding at launch of 76 either though.  Pretty sure it was readded after in this game. 🤷‍♂️
---
Antiarmor, higher enemies got dr/er buff, it was not nerfed at all
---
There needs to a fast travel market at the cook out. For when the event marker isn’t on the map.  I know it’s not super far from 76, but there should be a closer icon. Maybe I’ll move my tent from the Walmart parking lot of the Asylum.
---
“buT I caN’t dO iT so yOu MusT bE fLeXinG”
---
first day playing it.
---
so it's not just me.... i was making sure it wasn't just me having the issue
---
ACTIVATE THE PYLONS!
---
Happens in this game as well lol.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. I just see junkies and limb damage and immediately go to “magic”
---
Who  cares? Ammo is ammo and you don't have to pvp anyways? Or is it unfair on private servers as well since your such a vigilante 🤣🤣
---
I have 2 of 3 doors locked for this reason. I don’t mind of people want to look around or use stuff, but they always leave the damn thing open &gt;:( 
---
I close doors at other people’s camps, minus the garage door anyway. I feel like it’s simple etiquette haha.
---
Lmfao right 😂
---
congrats on the well-earned internet points.
---
This was a reward for this season, they said they were planning to make it allowed for the fixer as well
---
Been sorting by new and havnt seen any posts about it. Seen quite a few about them not completing.
---
I try not to post stuff that's been posted to death, sorry if I've missed something.
---
99 bugs on the 99 bugs in all, take one down pass it around 2,592 bugs on the wall.
---
In what state is that one? Geez, forgot it even exists.
---
Upvote for post and an extra for the username
---
And congrats on being a pointless troll!!!
---
Your supposed to shout "Get of my lawn, you pesky kids" that rewards you 2 extra treasury notes.
---
Hey you get rewards for doing nothing if you're there.
---
Has the grill master outfit been pulled and added to the atomic shop? Pretty sure I got 1 last year
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to get you so worked up that you couldn't construct a sensible reply! It's absolutely within your rights to ignore the difference between credit for player-driven engagement and publisher-dictated gameplay just because the example was a bit lacking.
---
And your personal attacks are just desperate; stay on point.
---
Then don’t play the game. Wtf just stand around like a turd on a log? You are what is wrong with this game.
---
Yes it has
---
I played since beta times (was stupid enough to preorder for full price lol), it was there, watoga was one of the best farming places for legendary mobs
---
Yeah it sucks
---
that's what you took from my post? whoosh...
---
That's a shame, man. Hope the arrival of BOS and new added stuff will bring something you'll enjoy...
---
I use it when going to somewhere like the queen or white springs as I like the 100# extra carry weight. Other then that I am the friendly teddy bear running around Appalachia.
---
it wasn't hard, but that's not the point.
---
I agree it probably won’t be until Tuesday.
---
You just met dogmeat. Best partner in the game
---
Well weeve known the spawns for about a year now so thats your fault
---
I recommended someone spend their scrip to clear some space for what they'll earn from MW, and got downvoted for it.
---
Yeah just went back threw all the posts from the time primal cuts started, there was 1 other post that was slightly similar.
---
No thats how the event uas always worked
---
How dare I be a new player. You're right, shame on me
---
nope not just you.
---
Got a picture of this?
---
And 2nd hardest? In case cranberry bog isnt on.
---
Maybe I'm just looking at it with Rose tinged glasses haha. I remember it being more like waves of hoards down in the bog. Not a few rounds with 3 fog crawlers lol
---
*If* that’s true, then you need to look up Bloodied and Junkies builds. Doesn’t really matter with One Wasteland coming soon though. I don’t recommend that kind of build for a new player in the mean time.
---
Hard to imagine getting to mid-200 and never actually using any of the good weapons.
---
Would like to know your thoughts on legacies once you can get your hands on one.
---
Obviously this is a very complicated subject. I’ll leave it to experts like you.
---
Idk doesn’t make sense to me personally 
---
I wouldn’t make 2 character with the same build
---
I did see the daily "claim workshop" SCORE challenge, but the Tyler Fairground and the Junkyard were unclaimed, so if I needed a workshop, I'd take one of those.  There was also a lifetime challenge of kill or be killed by another player, but that's just a one time thing, right?
---
Also, I fail at PvP.  As in even with pacifism set to off, I cannot deal any damage to other players, ever.  I can see the damage numbers pop up with my weapon, but they are all zero.  Yes, a very high lvl player might have some super awesome armor, fine.  But that level 18 that followed me around for almost an hour shooting me?  He was in his underwear for crying out loud!  And I could not deal any damage to him.  Then he went to my CAMP and started shooting my turrets and vending machines.  He did damage to them, but my turrets did not shoot back, and I still could not deal damage to him.  Finally blocked him for session.
---
The one with the green bandana on top of the rocks?
---
I've been to a ton of camps up there.  Assuming people camped up there to adopt him.  Theres a cat spawn in the ash heap just north of Welch where you can camp too.
---
In the tent next to the real fire you can use to actually cook, next to the box for the veggies
---
I could definitely see this in Forest/Mire, but the Ash Heap has great visibility and we made a HUGE circuit.
---
I'll head UP the cliffs next time if it seems to be bugging out.
---
If modders can do it (which they have) then it’s possible.
---
Or just participate in good faith, ffs.
---
Neighborly wouldn't be too bad, but it's already too easy for new players to travel anywhere on the map with CAMPS and Events.  You should have to earn some stuff.
---
Having this issue and the BBQ event not triggering on PC
---
the fix comes with the same update that activates A Colossal Problem and includes several other fixes. it was released on PC this past Tuesday and is coming soon for consoles.
---
Sure do. I was trying to add it but I am not really on social media so I don’t see where to add a photo. I can add a link but I don’t really have anything to link it to since it is on my phone
---
Seems pretty common then, thought my gfx card was melting down haha
---
I'd love things like camp plans to be shared, I've got all my faschnat stuff on one character, and all my meat week stuff on another.
---
I was. I was speaking to another individual. You took it in another direction too. Move on buddy. There’s plenty of posters go for it.
---
I wish 🤣
---
Nah, you were rude and now I've uninstalled the game. thanks.
---
It does
---
😭😢😂
---
This one only has a collar
---
It de-incentivises playing the game when you are at max carry weight and when 1 stars drop on things like a fat man lmao
---
Wait does this mean we can just server hop to finally get the mirror ball plan?!
---
Well fucking said.
---
Yes, but many people unfamiliar think it's a one and done thing. You get a constant contribution as you do the action, some people make angry emotes at spits or drums and act as if we're not constantly providing contribution.
---
I want a 90% reduced weight shovel so I can dig up the stupid tree growing in the middle of my camp.
---
Just got this lol was hoping it was a big cow on back awww damn lmao
---
Maybe not crazy but I've been waiting for so long. Very relieved
---
Sorry to impose on your "private conversation" in this public forum, how trying that must have been.
---
I'm not going to close your door.
---
You're just repeating yourself without backing up your argument. Vats is an aimbot that has legendary perks, perk cards and builds created for it and you probably whore it out in pve and somehow it's somehow bad to have it in pvp because it's an aimbot that would uses legendary perks, cards and player builds. Bethedsa even give us the option to not use it in Nuclear Winter.
---
To be fair, USPS has been losing money for years, even before the new appointee the  USPS said it couldn't handle the degree of mail in ballot for this election. They operate on a loss and even Amazon uses a loophole to dump money losing routes on the USPS. Given the historical context, there is a reason why the past 8 years services like Amazon, FedEx and DHL are preferred. What I don't understand is why anyone would jump through hoops now considering not much was mentioned 3 years ago or even 5 years before that. As far as the delays currently, you can very obviously attribute that to the pandemic as well as the ineptitude of the post office can be attributed to not its overall system but to postal workers who are also inept.
---
Got a b2525 on xbox
---
[Okay Cameron Mitchell](https://youtu.be/77acOyoT-d8)
---
Welp, looks like meat weeks getting postponed
---
To stuff all your guns guts and gunk!
---
I can definitely agree with you that you are trying. Have a good one. In the future I’ll try to reddit the way you want me too.
---
Did some research and there was a point where they "fixed" them to explode after a delay instead of instantly.  This is what I was thinking of.  My bad.
---
i think we shuold be able to transfer them if both characters know the plan
---
If that's your take away, you wasted a lot of time replying with anything.
---
The barrels in my camps backyard its wonderful. Especially when it pissed some guy off so much that he decided to nuke my camp after the event glitched on us...
---
System is helpful. Also wrong sub, see rule 10
---
Maybe split down the middle, and gate it behind Friendly (3000 rep)? That would restrict it to either the mission before Vault 79 (I think Buried Treasure for the Raiders), or slightly before that if dailies have been done a lot before that second to last quest.
---
This way it's not a free-for-all-users, but any player that has at least done a decent portion of the faction quests has it unlocked before they start the grind.
---
Yeah it's actually 9% for all cosmetic items as far as the info goes I've seen. Only the tenderizer mods have a 2% drop rate.
---
After siding with the raider or?
---
Done so many events so far and we complete all of them. You might just be in a bad server.
---
You could just speed run through the wastelander quests and get 1k bullion every couple hours... Hell no
---
I'd argue for Friendly status being the unlock. Requires a majority of the questline to be finished, but is certainly unlocked by the end of the questline and before the grind.
---
Were you expecting Bethesda to know where your camp was?
---
Deleting a couple cosmetic items and add some extra turrets. You’ll get some easy meat week rewards!
---
I guessed this a month ago lol. Had no idea the drop rates at the time
---
My speculation is they extend the time. One because of auto complete and two they’ll probably push back patch 22 due to issues.
---
If on the bridge walking towards Delano Grange walk all the way back to where the tunnel should begin except it is boarded off. If you look to the right of the tunnel there is a pathway. Follow that pathway all the way up the cliff side and search the edge of the cliff and you will find two skeletons, the dog bowl, the cooking pot, a rope presumably a leash and finally the tiny dog
---
Charitable donations for new players.  I’m constantly dropping legendaries to passers by due to my lack of space.
---
Then why haven’t they done it yet 
---
Too difficult to add to game lol
---
I wish it would equip in a display case.
---
Yeah I was like, what’s the point? If it’s really of concern put a lock on it.
---
I know, just wanted to let you and other people know since it was one of the first results to show up on google when you're looking for the drop rates
---
I was WONDERING why that kept happening...
---
Bruh. If it's a trash legendary and you have script fodder in your stash than pawn it off on some low level or put it in a suitcase at whitesprings station. Theres literally no point in hanging onto trash one stars when script fodder is easy to get
---
Just like fasnacht. I hate this incompetent company so fucking much...
---
Either way.
---
Now all i can picture is starship troopers meets fallout.
---
I love having my custom built house, but I agree, there are plenty of times I want to move my camp, and I essentially have to rebuild large portions of my house cuz they dont all save to the blueprint, or don't work with the terrain I'm moving to.
---
I've resorted to literally just saving a blueprint of my shack that I turned into a tiny makeshift house and using that half the time which is honestly very cozy and cute lol
---
but not for those who have not done the vault yet, correct?
---
If enough people show, they should regularly, it’ll be a breeze.  If you get tired of competing with the try hards just hang until the last wave.  I’ve seen 2 3* legendaries show up a few times at the end (depending on where the even happens) so try to get a tag in.  Sadly it like everything else and everyone is busy proving how small their dick is so good luck.
---
Great time to start. Just started Meat Week, in the middle of another community event, you can get a taste of the new Seasons feature before the new one starts in September, and a ton of new content coming this fall and winter.
---
9.09% for the outfits and backpack, 2.27% for the tenderizer, flamer, shishkebab, meat cleaver, and tenderizer mod plans, if I'm correct
---
You're on PC, right?
---
what damage does it do compared to the normal shovels?
---
To oversimplify it a bit, ballistic guns and energy guns are not the same, and whereas explosive bullets work for ballistic, is messed up that aspect of energy, turns them into ballistic, and all around screws up the code.
---
There was a post awhile back explaining in more detail, but even modders have issues fixing this in FO4 as I recall.  It’s something deep in the code they can’t easily fix, hence the fact that legacies are... legacy.
---
Wish us consul peasants had the colossal problem to do :/
---
Bought it this morning on PC so now, or really soon if you are on console probably.
---
I just started last week and I’m loving it!
---
The game was stale with content but with meat week it's making the game fun again
---
Haha, well it sucks it still glitches out, but i'm glad that this now nearly 3 month old post is still doing some good.
---
Depending on the area ive had it go both ways. I did one in the forest and ash heap, and they mobbed me.  The couple in the cranberry bog I almost ran out of time since I had to go chase them down.
---
Thanks for this i just want the backpack and the grill. Already have clean chally outfit and mask and got the dirty version
---
Man I’m luck as fuck I log off at 11:49am, back on at 12:30  and I never had this glitch I’m almost rank 100 
---
I don’t understand how people keep getting caught up
---
Brain Fungus Soup!
---
What system do you play on?  I haven’t seen issues yet so I’m hoping they’re not on PS4 or I’ve just been lucky.
---
It depends what you are looking for. Do you like other fallout games? Why/why not?
---
I never bought it because of the initial bad reviews but when it was on sale I snapped it up. 
---
I started playing 2 months ago and haven’t stopped since. I’ve already put 300+ hours into the game. 
---
So I’ve already got my money’s worth and they’ve definitely had lots of mine since I love buying new things to put in my CAMP lol
---
I enjoy doing the public events and exploring, looting and scrapping so there’s lots of locations to do that :)
---
Yesterday during my only ever attempt at soloing the queen, server not responding - dead - respawn glitch - reload - queen full hp.... rinse and repeat 4 times and i finally said fuck it and logged off for the night
---
Add double daily points also this weekend.
---
Same. At 90 now and havnt toughen it
---
Username checks out
---
Already made it to top three Google search result. Nice work
---
Rebuilding this game is hard work but i agree the people are so soulless that they might as well just be a tree. Super mutants have more dialogue than random npcs
---
Watch them take the idea of a shared stash and make it Fallout 1st reward.
---
Dose the outfit look like the one in the atom shop?
---
Thanks for sharing. Not what I expected. I guess if you have full outfit it makes sense.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
I was briefly using SH Games cheese method of standing where you initially enter and killed Earl. I was a split second late on running out of the rubble death zone but I was able to loot the body and instantly died. I got the normal rewards except no cursed weapon and obviously I couldn't loot the chest at the end.
---
I think so yes but it's the "dirty" version.
---
Excellent suggestion!
---
Hm have only been doing the bog and mire since I like the xp. Tha ks for the input!
---
Yay!
---
that's fucking horriable
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
That’s bullshit that they add a new rewards (PTS pennant), and them literally make it impossible to get unless you go and spend several thousand dollars on a PC for a small chance of getting into the PTS. Them accessing the new content early is reward enough. I hate when they make something unobtainable like that. The farthest they should go is a BETA reward
---
I think it did, but can't really remember.  It's okay; you know now.
---
Get yourself a Tesla rifle. See's them and most other pests off pretty quickly.
---
Been playing for a month now. Also avoided it even though I love fallout. Having a blast . I'm 140 hrs in and no stopping in sight. There are alot of bugs. But I still enjoy my playtime . Its mainly personal goals driving me. Making the builds I want,  money daily, and getting to high level.
---
😂 How dare them! They should design the game and events around ME!!! 🤡
---
There are primal cuts events every 15 minutes across the map. The main cookout with rewards is every hour, top of the hour.
---
🤣👍🤜💪
---
I've been waiting for SOOOO long and I'm so glad😁
---
I had not yet seen anyone do that. In that context, yes, people on spits and drums are absolutely helping!
---
You're welcome.   It's a lot of fun.   Kinda an intense week, depending on which area of the map you choose to do your Primal Cut Events.   There's a big difference between the monsters in the Forest and those in the Mire.
---
1.2k hours in and still enjoy the game a lot. Now is a good time to start, 6 months ago would have been even better in my opinion!
---
Just posted the same! I was so hyped and then so let down!
---
Also how many hours have you played and whether or not you’ve been here since beta
---
got pesky moles burrowing around? then do i have the solution for you. walk backwards. those pesky moles are no match for walking backwards and they will appear in-front of you like there is no issue. easy pickings
---
I thought so too! I thought Chally the moomoo’s cute little heads will be popping out of a backpack like the croc one.
---
Wrong sub my dude
---
Unless this is brand new news, there are no legendary currently
---
😂 A for Effort, Bethesda! 🙌
---
same
---
Daily Ops sounds right up your alley.
---
Explosive energy weapons are bugged so their explosive element does not get the modifier (see nerf) that regular ballistic weapons got a year and a half ago.  So the explosive part is doing a lot more damage on the gatling plasma on top of firing faster aka more rounds are hitting you.
---
I don't think I can wear it, looks crazy as a bloodied chef for the event! If I get the cow I'll re-visit!
---
It’s a weird visual bug with power armor
---
Is that a recipe reward?
---
Oh darn
---
here are the stufff you can get from the event  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eO6GDNSlQYbnFZcyBVSP02RtSwygKcEQFH\_NQi\_chos/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eO6GDNSlQYbnFZcyBVSP02RtSwygKcEQFH_NQi_chos/edit#gid=0)
---
nuke them from orbit, exterminatus style.
---
No you will not get banned. No need to even think it was duped. Enjoy your new rifle.
---
I just have healing hands on. Yes I'm bloodied build and yes I know I'm curing others if rads.
---
&gt;“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs.
---
&gt;"Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don't have enough Atoms, they can, but it's not, 'I'm now better playing against other players because I spent money.' It's not pay-to-win. And it's not loot crates."
---
&gt;"forever' “I’m not being ironic. Like, forever”
---
Lol yeah pretty much. But it also seems to be a big IF, if the legendary boss even shows up. Had two or three of these fail where there wasn’t a final boss/wave
---
Honestly, with the exception of unique stuff like the circus cage, prefabs are pretty useless. Instead of selling the red rocket garage, they should’ve sold the unique wall, floor, doors, etc
---
We havent unlocked it yet... that’s from the second half (bravo)
---
Shared "Bank".  Other MMOs already do this or did this years ago (Everquest II for example), there's no reason not to implement this in FO76.  Unless of course Bethesda is just lazy.
---
Executioner's cryolator (1 star, of course) for me. Ugh.
---
Idk if the amount of prime meat donated ads to any bonuses. 
---
I say this because. last year I never contributed more than the minimum and I got the tenderizer. 
---
However I just contributed 10 and I got the Chally mascot mask. 
---
Also remember you can cook and donate Chally's special feed. I'm not sure what it gives you but Grahm swears it's real and is not Chally's stinky piles.
---
Hmm, need to hear from bethesda again i think
---
Yes, you're probably right about there being more flat areas, (I'm only a level 15, I don't even have the entire map marked lol). My main gripe is really just how terrible they made it and how nerfed it is, like even in nuclear winter, it's unusable.
---
Never seen a bloied fixer before, is it new?
---
Sorry, I do not know the answer to your question since I’ve already raided the vault.
---
Brain Fungus is my go to as well and good ole Corn Soup still packs a punch for ingredient cost.
---
Geez, what variability!   I had two in the forest, one in the SD, and another in the Mire.   All were successful.
---
Still glitched....   ridiculous.
---
It's the shopping cart directly across from the central area. Between Chally and drums.
---
Yes! I loved the FO4 building (with mods!) as it heavily improved the experience, with tilting, no collision, and remove anything. I can see how this isn't workable on servers or an MO, but it makes it so much more enjoyable to be able to put something in the ground, or tilt it.
---
It's part of a quest which isn't finished yet. I expect that the dialogue is current filler, but will be modded later.
---
havent tried so far but from all ive read it seems that the primal cut events are bugged and fail for no reason 😬
---
It's just because they want people to use voice chat... you saw how reluctant they were in adding PTT.
---
A lot of people (myself included) thought this, though the name does make it sound like that's what it is. I hope they see these comments and make it a thing for next meat week!
---
We should be able to add springs to a door's hinges to make it auto close
---
Why not! It replaced Destiny and Division for me. Love the setting and it's actually got some decent RPG aspects unlike those other games. I'd say if you like previous Fallouts it's got to be worth a shot. They've made the new player experience much better and folks are keen to help around here, though it's best experienced for yourself until you hit level 50 I'd say.
---
If you're not sure what to do, drum or turn a spit. SUPER helpful that way.
---
Camps in the mountains are certainly fun but not for my type of building, as in the mountains I like having it like wilderness, with just a few tents. It's basically impossible to have a tent in the mountains (or the highest area I can go in the mountains, as a low level) without it floating.
---
Lvl 20
---
Yes, but I thought it went live for consoles too?
---
can't believe I forgot that
---
A Colossal Problem hasn't
---
I hate it when i find a new world and placed in one only to be dropped somewhere other than my camp.
---
All I am getting is damn meat cleaver plans every time.
---
Did you seriously bully a 13 year old over a video game? Jesus.
---
Thank god they have high drop chances
---
no
---
It was the same shit with eso console port , only voice chat for years til they finally added it 
---
But Bethesda isn’t zenimax
---
The Mire I would think.
---
Nothing but one stars for both the event reward and the spawn legendaries so far for me, but at least that means I can scrip them all without hitting the limit.
---
Backpack caught me off guard. It's a big barrel not a cutesy backpack! But it's a must have to complete the look!
---
Probably yes for very high stealth melee damage but other than that it's very convenient and reliable. My go-to test for slow firing ranged weapons is if I can kill the behemoth in one shot.
---
For stealth commando, it shouldn't take too many rounds but I certainly should not have to reload.
---
For heavy weapons, anything more than 40 rounds is  not putting out enough damage (for me anyway).
---
Me: Hey VATS let's take out that level 76 Yao Guai charging straight at us
---
VATS: Oh look, a Mole Rat
---
Me: For the love of God, VATS, it's almost on us, we're bloodied! It will kill us in one swipe!
---
VATS: Oh look, a Mole Rat.
---
My mangled corpse: ......
---
VATS: Such a cute little Mole Rat
---
I held off too. Just stared at the beginning of July. If you liked the other FO games, you'll like this I promise.
---
You could always look to do a trade with someone!
---
Maybe you might if you got banned from doing this. And let's say you do on a private server, your still able to take the items onto a normal server and sell for caps in your camp. I'm just seeing it through Beth's eyes TBF.
---
And ammo... Oh god, all that ammo. Once I get all the rewards the event can go to hell.
---
Yes I was.
---
That’s the wonderful thing about the PTS, it’s voluntary!  OP can play and test and you don’t have to.
---
Judging by a lot of the posts on this sub, there's definitely a pole or stick situation going on.
---
My thoughts precisely unfortunately.
---
Yeah I just found out that the event has more stages. I thought we were done lol. 
---
Thanks tho!
---
I carry a nocturnal 90% reduced weight shovel, if only it had 'faster digging shallow graves' it would be perfect
---
not sure if it's a reward but you can buy the recipe from Grahm for around 90 caps
---
Should have been 30. Apologies.
---
Yes! Excellent suggestion!
---
Make a new character and level them. They are a little annoying for me at lvl 235 ish but about 2-3 hours of play does it
---
It's...a PTS, chances are they are for upcoming content.
---
To me it says legendaries are so damn common they are hardly “legendary”
---
Gave me a Chuckle.
---
I agree. Everyone complains all the time.
---
Meanwhile I just want immersive straps for a bagpack
---
I just switched servers because people were either doing nothing or starting the events way too soon, on the new server people seemed to have no brain also so I checked the name of people and it turned out bethesda put me on the server from before. But thankfully on a different server is everything much better
---
I got the message my camp couldn't be placed. So I joined a new world and my camp disappeared and I had to re-place and re-build it
---
2-3 hours seems a bit excessive, don't you think?
---
Big pharma?
---
I’m up on toxic valley. He complains that “he will never get customers out here” and “once you get used to the smell of cake frosting and battery acid, it’s not so bad”
---
I'm not seeing it in the store -- where are you looking?
---
Wait wasnt this yesterday?
---
Find a gamma gun wraps and shoot yourself on the legs. Or find an assaultron head weapon and shoot one bullet. For me it gives me +30 rads every time I shoot one fusion fell. 
---
Or go and collect toxic water and drink that.
---
I have mine ductaped to my outfit
---
True. But I also agree the 100 rank rewards should show dedication to the game and be a slight bit of status.
---
If I did a new character it would be about 20 mins on the low end
---
Ahahahahaha, you guys got trolled by Bethesda, hahahahaha
---
I wasn't sure if Beth could trace ammo from using duplicate ammo machines.
---
The daily offers part
---
Oh and also, if place your vendor machines inside in the cluster fuck, wannabe feng shui maze you call a camp, I’m also not closing your doors. You already wasted my time. You close them.
---
the thing that breaks your immersion in this game is backpackstraps!? not the nuclear fauna and its crazy wildlife? deathclaws, mothmans, snalkygasters, giant honeybees, mirelurks and scorchbeasts.. backpackstraps.. fml
---
No. It's today. It should be on the free and daily offers part?
---
Fashionable raider outfit has a sleeping roll and a strap for it so it makes the backpack sit on top. Looks best with SS and jet pack
---
For me it's the Grognak outfit... could it be different on PS/Xbox??
---
No, but I find it is one of the events which spawns the most frequently.
---
Slutronaut The Headache Queen probably left it open.
---
Yeah, but   
---
1. I like the mystery of a blind date  
---
2. This is the wasteland, it shouldn't be safe   
---
3. I'm looking at it from the other side  
---
4. and, most importantly, no, it's *nothing* like that. This is a video game.
---
WAIT I think I logged on really close to reset so...
---
From the first Meat Week it was happening, it's gotten better, but we're also in a new run with some new players, so just trying to make it clear to not bother the drummers/turners.
---
do you perhaps find it to be a challenge to level up?
---
I like to craft cool weapons for low level players. Love making fixers as I was given one at level 20ish and it saved my ass so many times!
---
Yep, my fastest TTK of Earl is 10 seconds. That is with a 'magic' weapon. If I had to do the fight without a magic weapon I would probably use a Vampire's faster firerate Gatling Laser or Gatling Plasma. Or I might use my recently acquired Junkie's Explosive Gatling Plasma (not a magic weapon, just legacy).
---
Its always in rotation and not season if that's a what you mean, but you still have to wait for the event to activate
---
Lock your door but put window nearby and put workbenches/chair/bed/etc on both sides (inside and outside) so players will use them to teleport, either to inside or outside.
---
Gotta build your camp somewhere that’s not so high traffic. It sucks when you find a nice spot, but if want to not have to worry about it it’s just want you have to do.
---
It’s a little strange. My experience today has been that the Ash Heap final boss is consistently a legendary sheepsquatch. Cranberry bog is a non-legendary mutant behemoth and the forest is a plain old deathclaw. Haven’t tried the mire yet.
---
Ok thank you i had no idea what was going on, im only level 46 and just got the game like 4 days ago
---
thanks
---
Commy spy outfit has the white straps make look like bag straps.
---
Nooooooooo.... lol... That would explain it!
---
thanks man
---
What, were you raised in a post apocalyptic barn or something
---
I bought it yesterday for 250atoms today there's nothing for me
---
I like it because it allows people join the event, team up, move perk cards around, take photos, etc.
---
I feel so dumb hahah
---
He lost his hand squeezer exerciser thing in the nuclear war.
---
He's got to get his hard squeezing in somewhere other than his Mr. Sausage.
---
They just don't care enough to fix it.
---
Me and another person figured it out. I was playing like minutes before reset so it would've been yesterday's offer🤦‍♂️
---
Ive always noticed the cats despawn when people csmp near them in the lake bed and by that one bilboard by whitesprings. Do the ones in the ash heap stay?
---
No they can't
---
Don't worry it was a beautiful dream for a moment for so many of us :)
---
I prefer the raider outfit personally, it’s dope
---
Really? Because it just popped up for me. Not top of the hour. Ps4.
---
I found several times that unless I fast travel to the event  sometimes I’m not in the event.  I see other people’s name bieng white not yellow like when you’re in a team event. I have fought the queen and noticed I didn’t have scorch earth timer on screen so I click on the event on map to join it    You will still get something’s from Queen body but no flux
---
Wait! I found a way to make it work in my favour! Are you now about to patch it?
---
New here sorry for the dumb question, there’s a limit on converting legendaries to script? I know I read there’s a 1k overall cap but, daily limit?
---
Yes! This! I'm fine with every other challange but this one is so boring. I dont level up quickly with my normal gameplay so I just end up running West Tek a couple times or start a new charecter, which is a bigger waste of time. It feels cheap too, like they just couldn't think of another challenge so they threw this one in every day.
---
All i remeber is doing the yao-gu, honeybeast, and hermit crab one alot and having to run up the hill to get the enemies unstuck
---
It's more of a nuisance than a challenge
---
Once I watched how some low level scorched was slowly destroying the fusion generator. No regrets.
---
I don't even see it in my CAMP menu anymore.
---
Primal Cuts? or the Meat Week cookout? the Cuts happen every 15 minutes, but they are an optional side event. The Cookout happens at the top of the hour and is the main event.
---
I never had a problem with leveling up (@ lvl 262), and I just finished the LR today.  I guess you could do the new character thing.
---
Ohhh, my bad. First time doing this event.
---
I would totally agree if all effects were on the same level. But, theres nothing legendary about  getting bashing damage and movement speed while aiming (magic weapons excluded).
---
Don't know why you even need your tent when you can fast travel to the event for free lol.
---
It doesn’t happen often but it’s def creepy
---
I think you should make the very best most lethal PvP player u can. And the run about desperately trying to grief people like myself who have pacifist on and just laugh at you.
---
It takes ten minutes to do this challenge.  Make new character, walk to the Wayward.  Make a weapon and any clothing piece.  Enter wayward and spam the talk button until  it's over.  Delete that character when your done so that you can do it again the next time.
---
And it's as simple as that.
---
It's nice to see these, could help save a life!
---
That's way better than what I expected it to be.
---
Yessir.  Hes an intentional named single spawn not a generic random critter spawn. Murgle is his name iirc.
---
I've leveled up every day of the event (currently at 262), and that admittedly was a bit of a hassle on some days. I'll end up finishing this run with about 10 days to spare, so now that I know there's a bit of a cushion, I won't push it as much in season 2.
---
Same here! And Cranberry Relish, although not as easy to make. I find the Fridges very handy indeed, and Turbo-Ferts!
---
Ehh, sometimes I see that the house owners themselves left their doors open because once in a while when I am closing them, lock appears.
---
This is one event I don't get too pissed at if people afk as long as they are on drums or spit. You can complete it with just one good person gathering and several folks on the passive stations.
---
Nice. Good to know. I guess maybe next week (I’m console)
---
They're not rare that's for sure.
---
You do you.
---
I have the log cabin and red rocket garage as my prefabs. 
---
If they could make the cabin a bit bigger that would be great.
---
Started a month of so ago after tearing through FO4 and 76 def fucks hard, go for it
---
It’s not for griefing, dumbass. I like PvP. That doesn’t mean I’m a griefer.
---
My issue with it is keeps getting harder the more you play while the other challenges stay the same
---
When I solo a primal cuts it freezes at the end of the third wave. Doesn't happen any other time when I'm with other people at the event. I'm getting really tired of not even being able to even alt+f4 because even that doesn't work.
---
lmao, they are lvl 100 on pts.
---
lvl 100 molerats. it can kill a fucking radscorpion.
---
And the circle of another pointless post comes circling back to me *sigh*.
---
Will admit I have had the have since beta and launch but I didn't play the previous meat week event so I have no clue what I'm supposed to do. By the time I travelled to my first one people were rushing through it and i didn't get a chance to get any idea of what to do.
---
Don’t listen to him. If you know good farming locations and use food buffs you can lvl up in 25 minutes or so at 320.
---
I just got on and I’ve leveled twice so far in 2 hours just standing around doing primal cuts meat week and a little farming.
---
It’s not that bad for normal players. But for those lvl 500+ guys ya it’s pretty bad. Idm this challenge since it rewards twice the amount of score then the others.
---
Yeah... I don't think it has happened to me at all. I've "auto-completed" a few things, especially when the season first started, but I don't think I've ever not gotten score for them... might help that I'm on the west coast and never start playing before 9am.
---
Lol. And you call others snowflakes 😂😂😂
---
Besides, I asked which would be better. The GP or the handmade?
---
I hate this glitch too. I generally just move to a different locations. When I go to do cop a squatter I always get the bug trying to leave. If my friends weren’t so dependent on my shared card, I’d probably follow suit...
---
More like Barelly the Barrel lol.
---
I miss calculating how many atoms I'd need to get to buy the new items in the shop. I definitely wouldn't mind dropping a five or ten to help out with that either. Now? No.
---
100% the Tesla or gamma gun
---
Technically the whole nuclear fauna and flora is immersive in the world of fallout. Not floaty bagpacks
---
How do you get Beckett? As far as I can tell I never got the prompt for him to show up at my camp
---
Wait.
---
Why cake frosting?
---
^ Found the not-Irish guy
---
The only real clue is my vendor contents shown on the map, it doesn't match up with what is at the obvious one. I figured people playing a 15+ game can extrapolate that info and answer a simple puzzle.
---
Well, I TRIED to use explosive bait to break into and destroy a base full of hidden ammo refineries lagging the fuck out of a server. (I saw them when the base was loading in, inside a conspicuously large rectangular base). Unfortunately, the bait just did not want to go off. Even tried calling in an orbital bombardment for no effect.
---
Was I doing something wrong?
---
They can't trace ammo or mass pickups. I just max budgeted my camp until they fix it. I don't want one taking up space and looking like shit.
---
With the right setup and on a team the risk team reward is quite good. I just join the event when it pops up. I get at least 500 caps, lots of screws and acid, a guaranteed random 3* weapon, the chance at a rare drop (the helmet), and a lot of fun usually. A well prepped team will easily take it down in 5 minutes or less, maybe more if people's builds are not optimized.
---
I can't even stay in server it's just keep crashing
---
kill animals and deposit the meat in the cooler. collect greens and deposit them. put out fires. clean up poop. spin the meat racks. play the drums.
---
loads of stuff to do. as long as you're doing something, it counts towards the progress.
---
part of the fun (for me) is how chaotic it is. takes a few tries to pick up the system, but once you've got it, it becomes automatic.
---
I never understood that saying. Most barns I’ve been in have big barn doors, that are quite often closed.
---
Same as here, I'm online now
---
Much appreciated man, I'm excited for it too! I just hope it isnt all so broken we can't enjoy it.
---
Ah sweet thank you! I did kill a few but couldn't figure out where to put the meat, I just played the drum the whole time lol
---
Nope, not as far as I can tell. I had about 800, and still have around that after my renewal came through. If you have 1600 more atoms than you should then it's worked, I suppose.
---
We all gave him social anxiety and he probably has nightmares about stolen bone saws
---
Effects are - Executioners / 40% swing speed / 90% weight but the Cursed prefix also increases damage and attack speed but reduces durability. Most times im pulling out a melee is low level mobs where the damage is fine or i need to finish off an enemy and dont want to wait for my guns to reload so the Executioners is great for that.
---
Stealth bloodied commando would be ‘the best’, but it will suffer in the upcoming daily ops if you care about such a thing. Can kill earl in a few seconds tho
---
sometimes you just gotta ask... when will you learn? you know the bug is there, you know they haven't found a fix for it yet... you not only continue to be online during the reset, but you come to reddit to complain about it. 
---
you have your own ways to work around the issue. use them. at this point you only have yourself to blame, we don't want to hear about it
---
A lot of times it can let mole rats or scorched in to wreak havoc. It’s annoying to come back to your camp and find half of your stuff destroyed because one mole rat was having a time for a couple hours. 
---
I mean, I don’t *really* care, but it is mildly inconvenient and frustrating for like, a couple seconds.
---
I figured it out quite quickly but the first minutes I was really confused
---
I love this post. I used to have an Ammo Factory because I got sick of making 5mm rounds for my Gatling Gun.
---
Ha Ha Ha... thanks! I needed that! 🤣
---
will give pay 5000 caps
---
What...uh...happens when you turn both on?
---
Divide by zero?
---
I pick the locks and loot every. Single. One.  I'm not petty, just an ammo collector.
---
Before nuclear war, the United States economy was in shambles and there was scarcity of nearly every commodity, straps not excluded.  Luckily a genius scientist was able to create special clips to be easily attached to your clothing and your backpacks simply attach to these clips.  Such was life before the bombs.
---
My mini gun with shredder says otherwise!
---
Would make a hilarious comic strip.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Yes I was left no choice but to beat  a colonel Gutsy to death with on once when I  ran out of ammo. Fun that was not.
---
Ah, hopefully that's what it is. But one wasteland is a september update, it's almost september. I think we should be testing their quests by now.
---
My rule of thumb is have my benches and vendors exposed  in such a way that doors do not have to be opened. If they like what they see they are invited to explore the rest or the house is mostly just eye candy.
---
It got released for PC 2 days ago, and has been very buggy.
---
They couldnt even do it with creation club content. Bethesda cant bother putting money into testing things. Doesnt matter how well it sold. The money they put into making it is enough and anymore money spent is just out of the question.
---
At least we’ll have different bugs to suffer with when Bethesda fixes it for us!
---
What armor are you wearing? That kinda looks like the clipping I get when I wear a mask during monster mash. End up having 2 masks equipped at once and have to manually unequip the other one.
---
Its hilarious that some are so angry about it they feel the need to change my unlocked and free-ammo-to-everyone machines from 556 to .38 or gamma rounds or whatever 'junk' ammo. Like really? That is so petty and an extremely minor annoyance if that.  
---
Its not a big deal and if you hate the game so much, be angry at Bethesda for not fixing this trash fire game already or you know what, get with the program and let the rest of us squeeze as much fun out of this game as we can.
---
With how everything been going on. I agree!
---
Im gonna sniff your moms panties out of spite
---
Have done about 20 events, and probably a third of them failed in the last wave.
---
I've noticed a LOT of survival tents around, maybe messing with spawns?
---
u/ladydevann are the devs aware of the issues with Primal Cuts failing?
---
So I’m confused about the whole event lol
---
Breath Frank.. breath.. the general rule is: it gets released when its ready.. its better to just not gets your hopes up, more then often its a let down
---
How much would it endanger a player to just turn off the sound (or turn it really low)?   Like, for example, are there soft footsteps you need to hear, or is everything insanely over the top and you really don't need sound?   I can't stand annoying audio.
---
You can't convince players this way, man. Same way my friend can't convince people to stop using teslas at Rad Rumble because they're killing our framerate and making the game turn into a pixelated slideshow. Last guy my buddy got into an argument with that about used the 'Works on my machine' of fallacies. It's really up to Bethesda to make it so players cannot do this and troll events.
---
The gamma gun is useless against people in power armor. And Tesla rifles feel like cheating. And I don’t have either anyway. I only got the two weapons o mentioned
---
I miss some of the teddy bear locations. Wastelanders evicted most of them.
---
I dont see why there hate about this, Ammo is not exactly giving other people a disadvantage,  me and my friend go round camps picking locking them and looting them cause we need ammo.
---
I hope they wait until they get the bugs fixed before they release it to console. If there isn't anything with the update that is nuclear winter related I doubt I'll even update it when it comes out because I'm sure it will add some other kind of bug to nuclear winter like wastelanders did
---
It's not supposed to be a backpack OF Chally, it's the kind of backpack you'd expect to see strapped TO Chally.
---
Ok. Gl.
---
Man I dont need to be crying this early in the day
---
It one of the easiest ones to do. Create new character, run to waywards, do dialogue, run to overseers camp and craft one piece of armor. Ding! Done in 7-8 minutes.
---
I did a bunch of number crunching and posted this proposal to the PTS forum:
---
Players get one coin per level beginning with level 50.
---
Rank 2 of a card costs 25 coins.  
---
Rank 3 costs 40 coins.  
---
Rank 4 costs 65 coins.  
---
(note: these values hew very close to the cost of current ranking, but are simpler)
---
This would decouple legendary cards from regular cards and allow someone at level 830 or higher to have six rank 4 cards.
---
The devs could even adjust this to target a roughly level 1000 player just hitting six rank 4 cards by adjusting the 25, 40, and 65 values, hopefully keeping them rounded to the nearest 5, like using 30, 50, and 80 or something.
---
I'm sorry :( hopefully something gives and this gets addressed.
---
Emergency Protocols. Because my luck is horrible, I wouldn't trust the **Serendipity.**
---
\+ Stabilized, fall dmg, high rad protection
---
&gt; Ammo is not exactly giving other people a disadvantage,
---
I love how some people bring this up as a argument, like, you don't have to pvp with them, and most events people are already *melting* the SBQ anyways so what's a few more rounds going to hurt
---
[Biggie Smalls is behind this?!](https://youtu.be/phaJXp_zMYM)
---
Way to be a boyscout Klark...
---
While I can't say I'm 100% satisfied, I appreciate it. 
---
The rewards definitely felt like Wastelanders leftovers and a few space items for good measure, bc it IS Captain Cosmos themed... Armor Ace looks better on the rewards vs theme front. I skipped a bunch of level up and NW challenges, even a couple during double score, and still hit 89 yesterday. 
---
However, I miss the atoms. No Chicken Coop could ever make up for the loss in atoms.
---
Managed to get into one now hopeful stay in meat week
---
For real, ngl it freaked me out a bit
---
I know - manners, eh?
---
Still feels like a tall task to get 6 cards, I'd be fine with those numbers if the cards were stronger, but most of us are gonna grab ammo fac, one other card, then four specials. Doesn't feel right for how okay the cards are
---
I know for a fact that it’s players in my camp. There is only one door and it’s not even accessible to NPC’s
---
It’s the bathroom. People open it sometimes use the Decon shower and leave the door open and the shower running.
---
Good luck! Use staples, duct tape, whatever you need to keep yourself there! :)
---
I meant that play testing games is an inter-department job. Players who go on public test servers aren't always paid, but will usually receive either unique rewards or some kind of in-game exp. I don't play overwatch, but from what I could find, they also don't give anything for testing
---
Great game, always a good time to start.
---
Did you try turning it off and back on again?
---
I would vomit all over the place then. I think
---
People will always complain about something in this game. Like it was so hard to find him or god forbid you had to wait a few minutes while he woke up. Glory be.
---
150 scrip per day
---
Fusion core out, then back in and still not working /s
---
A grenade or an explosive projectile should knock the bag out of the spit. That worked for me at other things but I don't know if it would work during an event to be honest.
---
No it's not! It is still shit!
---
Woah that sucks! I’m sorry that happened to you. I hate it when I just have to refill my vending machines if I store them. That was a painful lesson.
---
Is the suit in good repair? Also getting out of the suit signing out and signing back in may work.
---
Yeah I agree. It should be them (the department) testing it first to see it all works how they think it should. Then released on a PTS so that players can work with it since there are so many players you’re bound to hit most combos that may or may not break it. Like a department member may not think to put a terminal on a sloped ground with X,Y,Z things to make an underground clipped camp but a player would. Basically just have the player base try to exploit it and you’ll see where the flaws are.
---
Yes, the limitations is a want, I can admit that. Roadmaps are great, but I'm also wary of what its actually going to be like, again they dropped the ball hard many times already.
---
Its not weird of me to mention the fact that they made promises and didn't deliver. And of course I'll mention Wastelanders, it was decent and would be disingenuous to not mention it. And don't act like you wouldn't bring that up as a gotcha about content.
---
Source? Well you can Google it, or even find Reddit posts about it. But here's one. https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/fallout-76-subscribers-disappointed-with-fallout-1st/z21de8
---
And the things I'm saying are what many echo. Read what fans have complained about. Just look at the state of the game. In the end, I want whats best for it. Maybe giving it to a team that actually knows what they're doing would be best. Was literally made by their newest studio with the least experience. 
---
Again, can do without the insults. Pretty sure can have a conversation without them.
---
thats for fallout 77 "the underworld" ,where a vault has traveled through an accident to the center of the earth...
---
I haven't had it happen in the Ash Heap, so maye you can try it out there
---
So why did they say at the end of the week and Lie even more
---
No not from what I've seen on streams I've seen a guy stream 10 of these events straight and no hiccups at all. This is bologna loads of fun.
---
Just drop another item (aid, ammo) nearby - the game usually merges your loot bags if they are close enough together.
---
Oh my, now you are in Necrophiliac territory. Good luck with that and bon appetite, I am sure those maggots will be a welcome change in taste for you.
---
Every part above 100%
---
I played the OPS in the PTS. Stealth is \*largly\* negated. They basically have such a large detection radius that unless you're at very long range the shit will detect you automatically. That is specific to OPS.
---
I have a legacy TSE scattered laser rifle and lit the bag up in frustration, it refused to move. We went under the platform to try and loot it, glitching up through the floor with our guns a bit, still nothing. I tried dropping more loot near the bag, hoping it would glom them together and move the stuck loot, but it just dropped a second bag. I think that junk's just gone.
---
It's always a good idea to be careful with ones junk around giant fires and spinning meat spits. You can always try to drop another bag nearby and see if the old bag moves to the new drop spot.
---
Stashing junk, whether AFK or not, seems like a no-brainer to me.
---
If you wear the outfit and mask you essentially become Chally the cow, which is why it has a little mattress to protect your back and the container for your stuff. 
---
Just like the Brahmin wear a mattress on their back and the containers on top.
---
Aren't bloodbugs the mosquitos of the wasteland lol?
---
Tried that, no dice, unfortunately.
---
Joke was on him then.  I had a few bones I  just looted from super mutants. 
---
I'm in the 130's for level, but this guy was over 250.  So I don't think I  should have looked like an easy target?  I think he must have had some kind of instigating assassin weapon in order to one shot me.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick when I ask this but  are you sure it's the excavator PA? I went farming in my ultra site suit one time and couldn't figure out what was going on at first.
---
I can understand the frustration from people who have a lot of stockpiled already but yeah, this is good news for me. Gonna squirrel away as many of em as I can.
---
As a member I take it upon myself to launch the mighty Enclave's arsenal of ballistic nuclear missiles at every opportunity onto the brotherhood when they try to enter our lands.
---
Very Accurate Targeting System
---
It’s the torso that gives the bonus. Are you sure you have the right torso on the frame?
---
Tried that, didn't work, unfortunately.
---
Are there “legendary” perks that help stealth work in OPS? I don’t know much about either system.
---
!ORBITAL STRIKE!!!
---
You didn't have a golf club. Lol.
---
Yes...annoying
---
No...dont take em out of game...makes it fun
---
Any threat to us shall bring upon nuclear annihilation
---
GET THE FUCK OUT MY HOUSE I’M PLAYING FALLOUT 76
---
In the couple I've done today there has been problem that seems to be similar to the issue with It's a Trap where if you kill the creature too far from the event site it doesn't advance/finish the event.
---
Yeah, somehow there is now radiation that even the CSS can not absorb. It's about 0.01/second.
---
But that's not all, if you stand longer than 30mins there the movement keys are disabled (on PC). I guess Beth doesn't want AFKler to help with the event.
---
This is why i’m looking forward to Fallout Shelters. Considering they’re about the size of a survival tent there shouldn’t be too much blocking it
---
Had this issue yesterday, still waiting for the reinstall to complete...
---
Just curious and not home to check - Does it say anywhere what that bonus is? I have only used the PA twice and couldn't tell if I was getting more than normal.
---
And if you don't stash it, you become a no-junker.
---
Make its stinger fire plasma bolts and it's basically the giant roboscorpion MKII with the legendary bloatflies attack!
---
From what I've heard: It'll have something to do with Steel Dawn/the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Darn. Did you try switching to 3rd person view and spinning around really slowly near it. I feel like that trick has worked all the way back to Morrowind times for things that fall in just the wrong spot.
---
Game states Arms but it's the Torso which grants 4x more Ore when mining!
---
Bro. I would love that to happen to me.
---
4x more Ore!
---
If you mine an ore outside of the armor you’ll get 2 and can harvest the node twice maybe. In the suit you get four and can harvest it anywhere from 2 to maybe 5 times. you easily double your haul of lead ore.
---
Embarrassing question, but how do you place locks on doors, mineral extractors, etc?
---
What about the people posting on here having lots of trouble with it?
---
I’m not frustrated. I’m going to be squirreling them away too. I just wish we could sell the treasury notes in our vending machines. If my math is right,  1 treasury note = 200 caps .
---
Lucky.
---
Ash heap is the same.
---
Not all mobs come to the drum and if go hunting them, they run away. If you kill them outside the event zone, the event fails. Yet there is no way to get them back into the zone :/
---
I have seen it fail with no tents up.
---
Dude I have, my camp been nuked twice, once because I was getting good amount of legendaries at the whitesprings during nuking and the second time was during a SBQ event. I wasn't about to leave when someone was about to nuke the resort for the enemies are better, and my scrap box got more than enough junk to quickly repair the camp while I'm loading my vendors with my plunder. 
---
My camp is complex build, has super fair vendor, was on the cliff edge near the resort but far enough to where you can only nuke it with the resort if you wanted to, but some players did.
---
No, I and neither do those blue Pulaski radiation protective chambers.
---
But I have no Mooore inventory space
---
Maybe many are lost as I am (my 1st Meat Week).  I turned in some meat and then didn't know what to do.  
---
I only did it once so far, but I'm sure I'll catch on after a few plays.
---
At this point, the Colossal Problem can pound sand...I've been waiting for the Deep Pocket Mods for the SS Armor, since Patch 21 when they lied to us &amp; said it was included.
---
Why are you server hopping Meat Week? The events happen simultaneously I though.
---
Velcro
---
never happened to me at all last year. hoping it goes OK this year.
---
I'll trust me I'm just as annoyed I run Secret Service armour as well and can use the extra carry weight. More lies on lies on lies... starting to see a pattern here with this company very disappointed
---
It's still in Beta.
---
It might fit with my drunk toon. Kinda looks like a beer barrel
---
How am I supposed to eat?
---
I think after this newer update its better now, enjoy the game 💪🏻
---
Nice, thanks for the info
---
Oh man, me and a few others were doing all sorts of dances to try and get it. Hopping in and out of power armor near it, switching in and out of 3rd person, nothing. I don't think I lost anything more than a few scraps because I'm usually religious about stashing junk, but this afternoon I just fired the game up and headed right to the event without checking first. And the game just crashed and I need to reconnect so that junk is gone.
---
Hes done you 2 favours there you owe him big
---
He means the broad damage nerf (to everything, not just junkies). The magic effect bug is supposedly untouched but they could sneak in a fix so who knows
---
I'm interested in how to speed run wastlanders in 2 hours.
---
It’s the tents. Tents seem like they cover 3x the amount of space as a camp takes. It’s bullshit. Tents should be moved automatically if a camp is coming in the world. I hate tents.
---
I seem to be in a particularly salty mood today...I can't even get excited about Meat Week, because none of the rewards are particularly appealing.
---
Been happening with 40mm for me, logged in to 346 40mm. Only had 50+ before log off.
---
Theyre not lieing... its actual work developing a mmo, shit breaks and considering the stability of 76 as a whole.. it breaks often. Why it happens though is a better question. With the gaming industry being in the billions tier and Bethesda being s multi million dollar company you would think 76 would run alot smoother.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks for clarification.
---
Agreed! People that are on drums and the spits ARE contributing to the completion of the event. Both of those are part of your objectives, so someone AFKing drums and spit are best. (eta I read it kinda wrong)
---
But.  Isnt the queens blast an explosive energy weapon?
---
A while ago I saw a guy going around Morgantown playing the Old Orc eho wants to die in combat with a great warrior encounter dialogue from Skyrim and PVPing people who accepted. Played the dialogue really loud tho was deafining.
---
too many people assume this is like Fasnacht, as far as AFK goes, it sounds like.
---
Feel you. 
---
if you have to go afk, Go play the drums or turn some meat. This way its a win win
---
This is a problem I would like to have.
---
yes. I think it's 15 per cookout. can't remember from last year.
---
I did four successful ones today.   For whatever it's worth, there were no tents at them.
---
I'll buy them if you're on Xbox
---
And the cookout is every hour?
---
Hail to the PC players, please get our game fixed for us.
---
A couple hours isn’t strictly two. But I beat wastelanders in an afternoon. If I ran full speed past everything that was optional and used glitches and everything I’d beat it in maybe less than two
---
Happened to me as well
---
Hey i have a request an any one gift me fallout 76 i really wanna try it . I mean it would really mean alot ik that alot (most) say its bad ,but i really dont care i just wanna try it out thx.
---
Banning the drum and/or turning the meat is one of the easiest things to do... Come in, drop off some prime meat, clean up some messes and wait a few minutes at the drum etc. Easy caps... Did the event successfully twice today...
---
The running on a decade-old engine that they have perfected pretty damn good with a few hiccups here and there. If anyone can do it they can do it let's stop with this delay to get people on the server so they make more money or whatever the case is... if it puts their stock higher who knows I don't know how that end of the business works but I do know that being lied to as a gamer isn't a good feeling. I've been looking forward to this since the announcement of it. Don't even get me going on the scorchbeast queen not being able to be crippled driving me bananas since the beginning of wastelanders. I want to see some changes and I want to see them soon with this company or they'll be losing me as a customer. 100% I give you my word they will be
---
BAAAA
---
The sheepsquatch! I should have known
---
I've made my camp in a super remote area and haven't seen another player come by since I built it, that seems to work well. I only get the occasional molerat or lone super mutant coming close, but my turrets take them out easily.
---
Also, level 1 lock on my private residence doors just in case. ;)
---
Ive heard it collects scrap, ammo and the odd weapon.
---
Holy shit haha. I can only imagine the confusion at first of why you weighed that much all of a sudden!
---
I'm not the right person to help with your build but I'm sure if you shared what your perk cards are, that would be useful info for whoever might be able to help.
---
I’m camped at the lead and junk resource nodes up by Crater. Sometimes I have to server hop 3 or 4 times, but surprisingly I get it first try most times.
---
I have a fence around my porch players have to hop over and then leave my door open because I gave up fighting these players.
---
I feel like there is only 10 servers going at a time lol. I hear ya pal about the camp drop. If it asks if you want to find another server it needs to put you in a server where it will be placed, if it can’t, don’t ask us if we want to switch
---
For the first time “it’s not a bug it’s a feature” fits really well lol
---
pretty sure thats near the bounty (west of lucky hole mine) . i think it's slightly north east of it. i could be completely wrong.
---
There were once 3 fireflies on mine😀
---
Same, can someone kindly explain please
---
The only time it hit me, I was online during reset time. It is known, if you are online, there is a great chance that you get the bug. Also, if you log into NW before Adventure mode, you most likely get the bug. If you log into the Atom Shop before Adventure mode, you get the bug. If you log into the Legendary Run before Adventure mode, you get the bug. Also, there is a low chance to get the bug anytime, but if you are online at server time, the chance is greater.
---
This is what I thought too! Can someone deny or confirm instead of Downvoting?
---
I will wipe out the entire brotherhood myself for grahm and chally if need be! They wont expect the person in T-60 elder power armor to be a traitor hahaha.
---
No. There is a legendary perk to give you some bonus damage on a target after the initial stealth hit, but that's meaningless when you cant strealth
---
I understand one or two times that it’s finding a world, but more than 3 times is crap.
---
I would take afk on drums or spit over what is happening in everyone I go to. One success for in 5 hours, had ones with 10 + people fail, insanely frustrating.
---
It's probably like fasnacht where if you get it done quick you can find another server doing it slow and get rewards from both.
---
Is the Tenderizer a Fixer style weapon that has like inherent bonuses unique to the weapon or is it just a Super Sledge skin more or less
---
No, Fastnach plans are dropped after you used them.
---
It’s 40 minutes until the next event and I am already beating the drums. I’m helping out as much as I can based on my AFK status.
---
I was born in a trailer park... same difference...
---
Damn, that sucks. I've had only one failure and that was in the bog
---
The only ones that wont drop again are the beer stein plans
---
Proof; Ive had 2 brahmin grills drop in a row
---
In Juiceheads latest video he talks about how they’re part of a quest in Steel Dawn that hasn’t been finished yet. There’ll be more to it later
---
where do I go to start the event
---
Anti-cheating, but you took the ammo?
---
The plans for fasnacht did not stop dropping once learned. I doubt they do for this event either.
---
My only issue with the inflation argument is, there isn't really an economy to begin with.
---
So just play the PTS?...
---
Yes and imo too, it's 15
---
I wasnt saying Dont do the Drums/Meat Spinning things. My post was about how people afk at the event and do nothing. 
---
People who afk while doing drums or meat spinning are very much welcome. 👍👍👍
---
God I hope you're right
---
To avoid loading in to the same world again, I quit to menu, then open up atom shop before trying again.  It always gives me a new world.
---
That's extremely unfortunate...
---
Yeah... only Chally doesn't have a barrell on her back, which is a bit of a let down!
---
So leave them in suitcases for other players.
---
Haha, love that link
---
It's a big old barrel!
---
Yes. I complete it super fast so I can server hop and get into another one
---
While I was still playing I made an automatic door for that reason. Defaults shut, opens on timer with pressure plates on inside and outside to open it.
---
No worries...
---
It's not a bug it's a feature
---
what platform? just did a couple cuts and a cookout no problem on PC
---
Just the steins were like that
---
Bethesda likes throwing things at people who dont need this junk
---
Like you guessed it's supposed to go along with the Chally outfit.  You don't see Chally strolling around with a smaller cuter Chally strapped to her back now do you?
---
That sucks, I was really hoping this released with no issues, especially since it has already been released twice, I'm still gonna try I want the backpack.
---
Yes, then dropped it in a pond.
---
That is true. Forgot about that one.
---
It’s still active at the same time on all servers right?
---
I just had this happen to me. Although when I joined there was 1 other guy there waiting. I went afk waiting for the timer to tick down; when I got back, the room was empty, so I dropped down. No one inside. Guess the other dude left and no one else joined. 
---
I’m a bloodied HW/Explo/PA build with high end weapons and a lot of ammo, so I figured I’d try soloing it. 
---
After repeatedly dying to getting feared into environmental hazards, and his health resetting since there was no one else there, I decided to use my Vampire Gatling laser that I had. I was only carrying 4 fusion cores, but at 1000 rds a pop I thought I had a chance.
---
I melted him. Turns out I hadn’t really paid attention to the other stars on the gun (it’s a 3star.). 
---
33% VATS accuracy And 1 perception.
---
Yah, for those of you who keep up on this kind of thing, ~200 fire rate and 33% VATS makes for a magic weapon. And a Gatling laser has 182 fire rate by default, which is enough to go “magic”. 
---
Good times.
---
You need people turning the spots and banging the drums to keep the bar from going down too fast.
---
That's a good shout actually, but how to stop being booted for inactivity?
---
It really sucks when events fail with like 10+ people doing stuff :(
---
That’s the opposite of a problem.
---
yes but its ends at different times based on when you fulfill the requirements/ time runs out
---
Oh like that. I see what you mean now. 
---
Good tip!
---
only way to be sure
---
It is NOT the Handmade. You will get rekt if you're playing bloodied since VATS crits ignore all your armor. And even if you're sneaking, one stagger is enough to kill you. A proper power armor pvp build with a stealth boy or stim pump is devastating with an explosive heavy weapon.
---
Edit: Nuka Cola is your best friend
---
I definitely will be as soon as I get home 😆
---
*Plan: Beer Steins Display Case* and *Plan: Meat Week Souvenir Beer Stein* will stop dropping after learning (also they are not tradable), all other plans keep dropping. Same thing basicly as with Fasnacht rewards. Stein ones in there also stopped dropping after learning.
---
[Meat Week 2020 Event Rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eO6GDNSlQYbnFZcyBVSP02RtSwygKcEQFH_NQi_chos/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABdDE7hK4*WKNf9w8WP9xi95VqNI8FEQ)
---
Some times you can click on destination, cancel, click destination again and then fast travel works.
---
If you select target in vats then  deselect and select again then it works fine.  Pain in the bum but there it is.
---
True... but I also don't see her strolling around with a barrel! It'd be better if it was a mini-trunk like she has. The mattress is nice touch though...
---
This sub seriously needs a rule against low effort posts.
---
You would like to know Gun Fu's location
---
People also might be trying to scoop up rare plans from Grahm while he's easy to find.
---
I never really thought it needed buffs I just wish they would put the headlamps on all pa and add carry weight mods for the arms to help with carry weight  legendaries and backpack mods. I.e. separate mods for chems, weapons, or ammo reduction % etc. To pick the specific one you want or split it between the two arms
---
 I'd be completely happy with it then.
---
No tents anywhere to be seen, event fails because some spawns don't show up at all.
---
Whatever, don’t like it don’t read it and stop wasting both of our time
---
That’s because they rolled out a fix really quickly last time. But I’ve also had creatures run outside the event area as well as another Redditter today...
---
And here I thought me getting that shit three times in a row was ridiculous. You have the patience of a saint.
---
Wait for the event to start, beyond the 1:30 starting count down. Once the event starts, go over to the big pot on the fire. There will be a prompt to drop primal meat in in increments of 5.
---
Yup. Got the radiation emitter and clock so far.
---
Shh! You'll ruin my sales at my vendor.
---
World of Shovels!
---
I take it your gun dont have sights attached!?
---
Has worked last 3 events, just FYI, must have been only couple early events.
---
If its the ash heap I had the same issue. Apparently things are wandering away in that area, which I've seen. I had to go chasing down a cave cricket. I don't think all the underground mobs are helping either.
---
I use it to reduce the radiation damage I get, and I use my excavator armor if I get overencumbered.
---
Probably not enough players to have multiple worlds.
---
Jeeze man just ruin it for us all lol
---
You can't access the Atom Shop or craft any Atom Shop skins in the PTS, including stuff from the season rewards or Nuclear Winter.
---
Congrats, but you're going to miss grinding out the new meat week and colossal problem rewards. Preston Garvey says there's always another grind that needs your help.
---
He's trying to tell you something
---
Yeah it was in the ash heap, that would explain it then. I had thought about that, but there weren't any markers on the map, so I didn't go looking unfortunately
---
It can also be used similarly to “few”, but in smaller amounts, such as 2-4. And I’m not talking about the rep. He said that we should share bullion/rewards with every character. That means that if you make a side account, complete the main quest in a couple hours and get 1000 bullion, buy bullion and turn in treasure notes for an extra 500, delete that account, repeat, it would be exploitable in an afternoon. In an afternoon you’d make about what others make in a week now
---
dibs on your stash
---
Oh.. that’s lame... don’t they want us to text anything everything so there’s no problems?
---
I've personally been a volunteer/listener for the Samaritans and will vouch for them! Their method of listening is a very underrated form of counselling.
---
They're not a religious organisation either in case anyone is apprehensive about that stuff.
---
I have the same problem with getting all the sugar bombs that I want for Brain Bombs so I tend to use the soup as much as possible.
---
Just had it happen on PS4. Also, for me at least, performance is horrible. During those events I’m being killed by mobs that aren’t visible, seeing players with just heads, etc.
---
This was my first time doing it.    
---
I got the plans for the Meat Cleaver, Meat Week Stein, and display on the first go.    
---
There is an easy guide to it. You go to Prime Cuts as much as possible which does net a lot of mats and meat. You are awarded the Prime Meat as long as those events don't fail. I dumped 5 into the fire and went on to "Bang My Drum" for over a minute till it ended.
---
Ok I got it last year during meat week but I was a fresh character and doing a bunch of forest events. Thank you
---
Nah. If I consider spending caps in your camp I'll do WTF I want with your doors /raiderlife
---
Haven’t heard that name in a long time...
---
Yesterday was noticably bad for me on Xbox. I have a great Internet connection, so that's not the issue. I normally never get DC'ed.
---
That and the big ole “Legendary Boatfly” from New Vegas. 
---
When it kills people they have a boatfly spawn from their corpse like the boatfly syringer Lol
---
idk what you play on, but when your in your build screen, switch to modify, and it will be (on console) if I'm remembering correctly Left trigger, either way when you switch to modify, and scroll over the extractor or door, on the left hand side at the bottom it will have lock and which button to press
---
Not the stein plans, after you learned them they stopped dropping. Same thing with this event.
---
Unfortunately I have no idea what caused it. My camp didn't blueprint either for some reason so I'm having to rebuild. I did sulk for a few days and stop playing lol I remember back at launch I used to lose my camp every time I logged in so silver lining and all that lol
---
&gt;Also, there is a low chance to get the bug anytime
---
In other words,  "no one is safe"
---
Ooh yeah, forgot about the rad emitter. Got that one too.
---
Ha giving graham your meat
---
I can dig this!
---
Also is it me or ir nobody playing the event and or is this everyone's first rodeo?
---
This gets posted about once every 6 months.
---
The only problem I have with fast travel is sometimes it crashes my game
---
Yeah, Nuka Cola Quantums can restore 600 HP over 8 seconds, and they stack.
---
Wait people actually buy them? I always see them for sale but never got the point since the insult bot seeks to spawn once ot twice a day for me.
---
Xbox one, should have noted that.
---
I thought it was just me. Happened in three out of four attempts.  In one of them everyone else apparently had the same experience due to all the question mark and angry emotes thrown up afterward.
---
Bug travel fast ?
---
Wasted time is clicking on a thread expecting to see what someone is actually complaining about and realizing they couldn't even be assed to write anything beyond the title.
---
The secret of the Wasteland is to put a rubber band around your controller so it doesn’t go inactive. I use third person view and rubber band the right joystick so the view spins around very slowly. I got all of the rare mask rewards from the Fasnacht parade doing this before I went to bed at night during that event, plus one god role 3* bloody weapon...
---
First time for me as well.
---
What level are you?
---
Then ill sniff any females panties you have family relations with
---
Hmm I think last year the more was a non legendary hermit crab? I do remember going to the ash heap a lot sheepsqautch
---
It's not difficult if one modder did it my guy
---
Because It my playstyle 
---
Im also sneak melee build too
---
Me too. I had 13 maybe 15 40mm, logged in and had about 160 40mm 😅
---
Where is graham
---
You can see when there’s something written beyond the title from the main page mate 👍🏻
---
Also it doesn’t need any expansion, anything added to the game is broken, use your brain and read the sub and you’d know that meat week came out today and if you’d played when this was posted you’d also know that primal cuts kept failing
---
Thanks a bunch! ❤️
---
I have had something similar i broke down and got the monthly pass for 1st and had the same issue but in a private world
---
Wait.. People are actually counting the caps they spend fast travelling? I only log in to do my daily/weekly SCORE everyday (including the level up.. So I guess I am playing quite a bit) and I'm almost always 25k-30k caps. I keep having to shut down my vendors due to the caps cap. This is including spending 6k a week on bullion from Smiley.
---
It's maaaaaaaaagic
---
Going to give it a go! It's a no-lose situation anyway!
---
mire is a lvl 100 mirelurk queen
---
This is as much everybody else’s sub as it is yours and people are allowed to post what they like, if you don’t live it move on, so get off your high horse
---
98 atm it’s still a fairly low level character. I haven’t been playing for very long.
---
Originally I was being sarcastic but nobody seem to pick up on it lol 
---
Text chat would take this game to the next lvl.. I can already see all the trading going down 
---
Text chat
---
He's responding to your unnecessarily added comment:
---
" And no, I will not go and play Nuclear Winter for you snowflakes who want me to keep PvP out of adventure mode. "
---
I'd say you're the dumbass if you can't see that correlation.....snowflake. You add in a smart assed statement like that, that wasn't needed for your post, and then get mad when someone is a smart ass back to you.
---
And this is the reason I have not learned the beer stein yet. So far today, I received four of them. I’ll sell them in my vending machine at a later date.
---
My guess is that a lot of new players have arrived to the game. So yeah for many it’s probably the first time with the event. Which is super cool! Just trying to help us all 🙏🏼
---
Thank you for telling me what an "old ironside" is! had no idea what it was
---
Bagpack?
---
Meat Week stein plans are not tradeable.
---
adios
---
If you'd put even fraction of the effort into this thread as you've put into getting salty about someone pointing out how much of an attempt at a lazy karma farm it was there wouldn't have been a problem.
---
If only it was .308 round
---
Don't judge how much whiskey I need
---
Happens to me all the time. It's lazy coding.
---
I believe they did with this event (2% chance or so)
---
It's called the tenderizer and you can get it
---
The tenderizer
---
First you have to get him drunk and relaxed
---
That’s dirty...
---
I couldn’t give two monkeys about karma, so why don’t you get over the 0.2 seconds you ‘wasted’ clicking on a link and move on, don’t like the post, great, move on 
---
And again call me lazy sure but if you spent 0.01seconds on this sub you’d know what I was talking about 🤣
---
Only way to one shot people anymore is if they are running bloodied. It's pretty easy to drop other players. I've had a few people I tried to help get some experience and they are always surprised at how fast they can down someone with a decent weapon and build. 130 is still low enough that people might come after you. 250+ usually means the person has had plenty of time to get the gear and fine tune their build for PvP. Best advice if you want to take workshops is stay crouched and immediately stash your junk. I usually only take workshops in hopes of finding someone that will fight me anymore. Fusion cores are about the only thing you can't farm elsewhere.
---
Just so happens it is a possible reward in this event. The weapon itself (named Tenderizer) can drop, as can plan for it and different mods.
---
Just account wide plans and recipes for fucks sake.
---
Didn’t realise you were the Reddit police 🤣🤣🤣
---
There is a lockpicking challenge.
---
Got any legendary weapons?
---
How often dows the event take place? Every hour like Faschnact?
---
Unfortunately with game development, shit happens. Especially with bugs. Not lying if something unexpectedly shows up in the event that would be detrimental to the build, which I'm sure you'd complain about if it just shipped with the bugs.
---
Saying that a delay is lying is akin to telling your child you're going out for ice cream today, but something unexpected crops up and you cant do it.  Delays happen in games, it's the nature of the beast; which is something you need to grasp, apparently.
---
Someone says level 7 before, it’s somewhere in that range
---
We had a primal event fail on ps4 when we killed everything.....
---
I got that in the first event I did. I just assumed we all got it
---
Finally someone understands placing 60 pipe rifles on your vendor to attract customers makes the said camp a nuke target.
---
You just need a friend to hold onto it for you and stay in the server.
---
I was just happy they got the rewards. We all usually farm that or the Scorched Earth so there will be plenty more.
---
Did you look under outfits?
---
Yes. Daily Scrip limit needs to go. So does daily bullion limit.
---
He's the Isabelle of the wasteland.
---
Did he really delete his entire account over this?
---
I missed last meat week so just turning spit for now till I watch some YouTube videos on what to do.
---
Look in the tabs sometimes things get crowded to over there
---
Yeah OPEN to PvP if the owner has pacifist on, nothing happened to the person with the camp.
---
Do any players sell that plan? I vendor hop constantly, and I swear it's the hardest plan to find in vendors. Still haven't found one yet.
---
I'm finding the area the enemies spawn in is massive especially the cranberry bog. Also can we please just for meat week increase the scrip limit im already overweight and it's first day.
---
You have to remember though, that this brotherhood is different from the brotherhood in 4. I forgot which it was but I’m pretty sure in either fallout tactics or fallout brotherhood of steel has a ghoul in the brotherhood.
---
Why is joining teams "iffy"
---
This here is the correct answer. Take off the piece or pieces of armor that you have with this perk and it will act more like a normal shotgun.
---
You expect 'Thesda to be able to track where each individual BULLET comes from........
---
really?
---
 A whole new world  
---
A new fantastic point of view  
---
No one to tell us, "No"  
---
Or where to go  
---
Or say we're only dreaming  
---
A whole new world  
---
A dazzling place I never knew  
---
But when I'm way up here  
---
It's crystal clear  
---
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
---
Putting that mod on it turns it into a 'magic' shotgun, so that's why it destroys everything.
---
Okay so disable that character from coming onto public servers. They can disable NW for modded characters so just do that for Adventure mode. Plus you get them to pay for Fallout 1st so its a win-win
---
I thoroughly enjoyed the building of Fallout 4 and spent just as much time if not more building as I did everything else. 
---
For me, the fun, freedom for creativity, and stress-relieving aspects of building has been replaced with frustration and resentment due to the overly stringent rules and restrictions, which I suppose are meant to more closely resemble reality, but its done in a way that unwarranted, actually diminishes immersion, and does naught by take away from an amazing system that didn’t need fixing. 
---
I have built my c.a.m.p up for my basic needs and that’s all I really care to do, and I know I’m very far from the only one.
---
Udderly horrible
---
I dont see it on the Specials tab or under Outfits.
---
I think they forgot to add it.  They either need to add it or fix their webpage.
---
Unlikely you’ll find someone not looking for you to buy it off them especially since most people probably just bought digital copies on pc, but Bethesda has free play weekends and pretty big deals on the game often. You should be able to get a copy for $20 or less if you wait or do some browsing
---
Does it need max rep?
---
Same, I love 76 but I’m getting real tired of it. Nothing to do in the game except wait for new shit and it all gets delayed
---
There were no tents present when it failed for me in the ash heap. We had just completed the final wave too.
---
And everyone bluescreens.
---
It was recent.
---
the crocolossus backpack is still my favourite, the crocodile is still the cutest thing in the game
---
Thank you so much, but it’s for all players or it’s only for Max Reputations players?!
---
I was going to edit my post about this after I read you wrote the steins couldn’t be traded. I fast traveled back to my camp to see for myself. You are correct the beer stein plans cannot be sold in a vending machine. Thank you for clarifying. I might as well learn the plan right now then.
---
Not tradeable or sellable.
---
At best, you can see how many times you've done the event
---
Wish I would've seen this before getting it. A guy was offering 10k gifts for it.
---
Thx for taking time to read tho.Btw u dont get it i dont have credit card u know i am still student and u know parents and stuff but thx for takin time to read anyway..
---
Of course
---
Yup it’s really painful if you low level players..
---
Just southwest of Vault 76 for Meat Week
---
Also good for acid if you do the savage divide or toxic valley event,  good fiber optics for the cranberry one, and gold in the savage divide one.
---
Fast travelbto your camp and it should work from there
---
From what I’ve seen from PTS gameplay the damage nerf is extremely exaggerated. It’s interesting because I’m on the other side of the spectrum where I think one wasteland is exactly what the game needs.
---
Lmfao I must be the only one who gets pissed when I return and my door is closed. Can I ask out of curiosity why it should be closed after leaving?
---
Do you have future tek skin on you camp?
---
That was my spot too for well over a year haha. The sales during Meat Week were out of control.
---
It's not a player thing ,it's a spite thing cause I'm a cunt and I don't even play this game i just saw it on the front page so I had to comment on it lol
---
Also bold of you to assume a goblins house has a door
---
Game pass for pc is your best option
---
I like it too, but we cannot change the colour of the lamp bulb.
---
As I like the Tactical Red light I am sticking with a Mining Helmet.
---
But what about when the door is already open when you get there? 😩
---
&gt; bad server.
---
You get these sometimes. Had two Fasnachts fail in a row, it was then I decided it was time to server hop.
---
I LOVE the first one, in the Vault Suit. It's 100% going in my loading screen gallery!
---
I have neon letters on the wall directly in front of the entrance saying shut the fucking door. And it works 90% of the time.
---
My armour is clipping through the same way, scout armour.
---
Do I have an alt account that posted this? I’m in the same bot, I get on, do nothing for like 30 minutes, then get off. Not sure what to do.
---
Oh no, I don't expect anything. Hence why I wasn't sure. But it is still potentially breaking Beth's terms.
---
Bud, it takes .000001 seconds to realize that the post consisted of just the title, without even clicking on it. GTFO with your absurdity.
---
I'm a lone wolf, baby.
---
I've heard it takes supplies from other collectron's.It also has a self destruct remote button that allows you to create a mini nuke explosion wherever the collectron is. It summons a baby scorchbeast princess. You have to repair it, but it's cool.
---
Play a new game. Fallout wasnt intended to play constantly like fortnite or games like destiny. I dont care what the devs add for daily grind. The quickest way to burn out from whag i consider the best franchise in gaming history is add daily grinds and pretend its a service title.
---
Fallout isnt a service. Its a game best played until finished then move on... or replay as a new character.
---
But again i dont care what the devs try to add to make it a daily grind service title. Its just not that and youre feeling the burn out of grasping for content.
---
Move on. Come back when there is new content.
---
Tbh all I've been doing since I've been back is unlocking ranks on the battlepass or whatever it's called lmao, I watch videos about all this different content and I'm just like "where is it?"
---
Like I said, they do have free weekends! Should just be a temp download that doesn’t require any sort of purchase or commitment.  Not sure when that next event will happen though
---
Some think it's tents but it's not. I've had them spawn far without tents.
---
Thanks! My sneak perk cards likely saved me here haha
---
Good idea. But wouldn't you rather not have the character disabled in the first place? Plus wouldn't it be on the psn account and not the individual character they disable?
---
I keep getting angry emotes at me. I cant use one arm due to an injury so I can't really play. I've been afk at the event for a bit.  Like, I'm helping x.x
---
I just did the break into vault 79, so now I can get gold slips, but I got on the game during Covid, life went back to normal so I just don’t have the free time to play anymore.
---
I'd love if the cores were tradable for ammo points at the converter...
---
Geez, think it wouldn’t be that difficult to just hide the armors for a costume. Seems like that should just be standard line of code when making a new outfit.
---
I feel that too.
---
I hope this gets some traction. It probably wont cause its kind of a rant but everything you said should be heard. The all to common bugs need to be a priority.
---
Totally agree im at max weight already and it's only just started.
---
Yes. It's been a pain doing that every single day.  Yesterday was the first day I did not level either character.  I did something else rather than commit to soley playing to level up.
---
"Get fucked, nerd."  
---
\- Bethesda, probably.
---
Same for me. I was'nt even that exited about wastelanders because i knew that big of a change would be so broken. I was wrong that time but i am proven right so often that it doesnt matter how well things work on the PTS an what not! Something Will break when it goes live
---
The area is quite large, but you can easily track the targets by the quest markers. Several of us are going out of our way to venture a long way out to make sure the last wave isn't out there, and just not showing up
---
Still trying for domestic kitchen tables plan on PS4
---
On drums you don't get an afk boot...
---
Shit my bad
---
It is happening quite often on Xbox. We have even had the cooking event decide to fail with 4min remaining. No reason, just fail.
---
Even easier if you join a build team right when you get outta the vault
---
I’ve failed twice already because no one knows what to do and they just stand there instead of doing anything...it’s painful. 😭
---
One idea could be allowing it to only be free for the side who you did the vault raid with. Giving more value and consequences to picking one over the other.
---
Or could tie it into the decision on what you do with the gold.
---
\-Keep it all for yourself and you lose it till reaching max rep,
---
\-If you give to one over the other its free for the one only till u max your rep with the other.
---
\-Split it between the 2 and their both like 3\\4s cheaper till hitting max rep.
---
Having it for free only at max rep still has value in that many will still go there for the daily quests to farm for scrip. That and they will be adding more content down the road, I'd like to think that they will flesh out the 2 factions a bit more over time.
---
The new boss quest line is already an example of them expanding on things if only a tad.
---
At the very least it should be gated to the point where said faction is no longer kill on sight against you, well I guess that would only apply to the raiders, cant recall the last time a Settler tried to kill me.
---
Just keep doing that what you do buddy!
---
At least it contributes to the event and is a whole lot better than those just standing around doing nothing. Hope your arm gets well soon!
---
Love the camper and whatever else I build I always include it.
---
The ones where I saw it happen, no one had tents or CAMPs nearby.
---
This is like, eeeearly Brotherhood though.  As far as has been mentioned in the game, they are just based around finding and guarding advanced technology.  Paladin Rahmani even says they're coming to bring aid to Appalachia, so they're still trying to be the good guys.  OG Elder Maxson is a swell guy it seems.
---
This could also be BS and they're gonna go exterminatus on West Virginia.  Either way...
---
AD VICTORIAM
---
My favs are marsupial and speed demon.  Jump real high and run real fast.  Use caution.  May result in copious amounts of falling deaths.
---
Gamepass on PC is like 4 bucks, your best option here.
---
If it makes you feel any better. It hit me last time. Now I don't log on between 11am and 1pm ET and avoid NW like the plague until I complete all the dailies.
---
The head engineer/the actual Overseer had information on his terminal. It wasn't a big deal, mostly just "I need to fix this and that" really, but it was something.
---
Pump Control intrigued me because there's a ton of emergency codes in there that I never got to look at. It'd be interesting to see just what Vault-Tec thought might go wrong.
---
I haven't noticed "more" per se, just that a bunch of things that used to have functions, like trying to initiate the GECK containment system, no inform you they're locked out for some reason.
---
Part of me is hoping the locked out sections'll be used for more difficult content at a later date, but it's an irrational hope.
---
I really wish there was some better way to approach this than ranting, but when official bethesda channels refuse all form of player feedback and what does get through goes unheard, there really is little more to do than shout to the sky until somebody picks up on it. You're completely right.
---
People have been complaining about it for over a year since they first stabilized it as a daily challenge, which means they will keep it in and pretend there's no issue
---
Not that I know of..
---
Pretty much all of them, except vegan for sure *bleh*. Marsupial and healing factor have been the most helpful for me. I hate watching my stimpaks, especially if it’s just a high dmg boss who can hurt me a lot but can’t kill me. It’s fun to just assassin’s jump them off a cliff, use VATS to lock on and prevent fall damage, then just start swinging. Walk away from those fights without a scratch.
---
Add Bird Bones to reduce the risk?
---
WhaaAAAaaAAhhAAT?!?
---
Your reward is forfeit!
---
I have 20k caps on my character. Some caps on another character and flux and weapons.
---
Crashing even on PC.
---
OOOOF I’m screwed
---
About the toxicity or the goblin door? 🤔
---
I could’ve sworn plasma and fusion cores were in the first iteration, but unfortunately not now. Really wish so though. Use’em to 5%-10% and then dump’em for full points
---
You don't need it, if you cripple his legs he'll stay in one place.
---
Fallout 1st only...
---
The day I buy ammo from npc vendors is the day I shoot myself they are so expensive.
---
Both. You’d be amazed how many cunts are commenting on this post being toxic af. I mistook you for one. My bad.
---
It’s like this for most armors. The entire costume is clipping with a lot of things sadly
---
Cause its cool looking and is an iconic part of Fallout. I dont even really love the mech suit gameplay introduced in FO4 that we have in FO76, but I played FO3 cause of the awesome PA helmet on the cover when I was in middle school. The other armor I loved is the Ranger Armor but I would like it as an armor not a costume and also feel gross wearing it as an advertisement for FO1st given how shitty Bethesda has become in the last decade but I digress. I probably wouldn't use it if it wasn't viable but seeing as its perfectly practical to play the game with I love using it and looking like a big bad robot man.
---
I'd rather have a BoS themed survival tent. But what do you mean by camp? Camp module skin? Camp items?
---
Good idea! 
---
This is also a tip for those who doesn’t quite get the event yet. 
---
And I’ll give you. I was really confused the first time also!
---
I've wished for a fallout online game since Fallout 3 so when I heard of Fallout 76 I was so excited.   
---
It has the potential to be the best game I've ever played so the frustration is real. I feel your pain.
---
PC is broken as well. Bog, Mire and Ash Heap all failed back to back.
---
Same, it’s hard to even wear PA because of the speed
---
Don't play this game but toxic players in any game are annoying, may your doors ever be closed my friend
---
Will give it a go thanks!
---
You are now my hero . Please post your photo to replace mothman. You are Greatness.
---
Screw the ant we need the all mighty cazador!
---
Nice try
---
If I were on a server where too many people were AFK, I'd hop.   There's no reason for it.   I love finding a group of people who will do Prime Cuts in the more difficult areas of the map.
---
You can't shoot yourself. You have no ammo.
---
Bethesda don't care about details, nothing will get done about this.
---
If you're gonna run herbivore, I highly recommend getting the Communist collectron thats in sale. That things my best friend, he always got the soups ready.
---
I just did my first one ever and it's really not obvious what I'm supposed to be doing.  This post helped a lot, so I knew to put out fires and stuff, but I was still just sort of standing there half the time.  :|   At least we succeeded (though I have little idea why/how)!
---
That’s kinda ridiculous, does a max Star legendary give like 50scripts?
---
Nah, lose too much strength
---
If you have the health regen mutation or any perk or item that causes health regen, remove it. That worked for me.
---
The first one looks so epic! Such a nice shot!
---
Isn't it only -1 with Class Freak?
---
Are they going to move my level 500 character and all his gear to the PC? And my other four character's above level 50?? If they can do that I will switch in a heartbeat
---
Yeah, that would be great.  I wish.
---
Check featured, then free and special offers. I saw it today. Also under outfits category.
---
Good idea, i'm gonna rename all my Nocturnal drops as Bloodied, put them in my vendor at a very good (but not too good) price and watch the suckers roll in, buying their trash weapon without double checking the description xD
---
I guess well have to wait to vendor shovels and pickaxes
---
which Chally are you looking at? He does have a barrel along with some other flotsam
---
They should have added markers for the idiots. Like, seriously, I've had a couple of events fail because people
---
a) trade with Grahm DURING the fucking event
---
b) stand there doing fuck all
---
c) kill the critters and collect the greens but don't turn them in
---
d) run up to you and hit you because you're on the drums or turning the spits
---
Like, seriously, I don't recall there being that many dumbasses last year.
---
This is pretty much Encryptid in hourly event form...
---
Probably, but I need that +1 for punchin stuff
---
Official post: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-on-hotfix-timing-for-consoles?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
Yep.  It's just a dirty version of the atom shop one.
---
I can see a few rare occasions, but I agree, and I get frustrated when this occurs over and over again.
---
\- they know where everyone's camp is, it is stored in a database. All they need to do is modify the FindAServer function to exclude the last one (or few) servers you said no to and to do a spatial query to see if any overlap between your camp and the players on the server camps. It is not like this is a query that is constantly done. It is hopefully done once a play session.
---
Why give a release date if you're going to keep postponing? It is terrible it's not good business. It's like you bringing your car to the mechanic and him telling you he's going to install new tires and it will be ready at 2 p.m. for pick up you call him at 2 p.m. and he says for you to come at 4 p.m. for pick up. You call him at 4 p.m. he says that nothing has arrived that it will be here in the morning you call him in the morning and he says that it will be ready after lunch you call him after lunch and he says that it will be ready at 5 PM. If you had a mechanic like this I guarantee you this will be the first and last time you ever use this mechanic. Why should it be any different than anything else in life think about it. They have professionals that work for them figure it out instead of coming up with stupid stuff for the atom shop. And nerfing damage build and coming up with great ideas like this why not finish what they are ready have obligations to. Makes no sense at all and I don't like the way this is going.. I'm going to seriously consider when it comes time to renew my yearly subscription to fallout first because of this. And don't get me going on the scorchbeast queen not being able to be crippled. That's a whole other rant.
---
Dont touch my brahmin
---
It pretty cool, development at slow pace but has some neat visuals
---
Once the event starts all the containers and some pots will be interactable, you can put meat 5 per stack. I kinda gave up on it because my prime meat spoils before it even starts, so I just do other chores and get the rewards.
---
Aside from this, I'd appreciate if people lower their weapons and refrain from hopping around like a kangaroo (please).
---
Actually, you can keep the pogo stick. But it just isn't polite, let alone safe, running around aiming your gatling laser at my furniture!
---
Which is exactly why this will never happen. OP didn’t think this through.
---
That was basically the first thing I thought when I read the title.
---
It’s bad enough that I’ve almost bought a Bloodied weapon before realizing it was level 10... *okay, fine, I bought a Bloodied weapon before I realized it was level 10.*
---
Henlo!
---
Yeah, no joke. It's no wonder everything gets dumbed down.
---
You know, the fireflies and little insects are NPCs and count as Hostile NPCs. Which is stupid but I think this is the culprit to some Fast Travel Problems.
---
Hire someone? I'd offer to hop on and hold it for you if I was at home. No lone wanderers in Wastelanders! Good luck!
---
Because sometimes shit happens? You can set a release date and find something that will completely ruin the experience. Translating games from PC to Consoles is not a 1:1 experience. These are things that happen to game development. You are applying ideology and rational from other business types which dont work when applied to gaming. Game development is not an exact science in terms of releasing content. COVID isn't helping right now either in that regard.
---
  If it upsets you that much, vote with your wallet and leave, well continue playing and having fun.
---
Yeah, and that's absolutely fair and a lot of what this general nerf was meant to accomplish.  Bloodied is still king, but it's no longer such a runaway success that you'd feel like you're screwing yourself by not doing it.
---
It is not on any tab for me.  I am a FO1st member.  I am not talking the individual costume which I do see. I want the bundle of them all as advertised.
---
I want to collect as many as possible, for no good reason at all.
---
I am in FO1st.
---
What? I’m already an alcoholic 🤣🤣🤣
---
One thing to keep in mind about toxic goo, it doesn't work if you have Aquaboy/girl equipped or if a teammate is sharing that perk.
---
Basic question- am I running Green Thumb and Butchers Bounty or whatever they're called if we are talking plants and corpses?
---
It's the NW kill x critters or revive x playes that sucks the most. Anyway, for leveling up if you're high level, just create a building team and hike intelligence, and do some guided meditation when it pops up.
---
Oh okay.I already have the bundle so I can't really help then. I could swear I saw it in special offers tab, but I guess I saw the costume.
---
Here’s what I have on my main:
---
- Bird Bones
---
- Carnivore
---
- Eagle Eyes
---
- Egg Head
---
- Grounded
---
- Healing Factor
---
- Herd Mentality
---
- Marsupial
---
- Scaly Skin
---
- Speed Demon
---
Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of **23** extra stat points. 
---
Other Effects: +50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, +20 pounds carry weight, x2Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons. 
---
**Class Freak 3** means I get all those benefits for a trade off of: -12 HP, -12 AP, 13% less effectiveness from Chems &amp; Stims, -12% Energy Damage, and no benefits from plant-based foods.   The last two are irrelevant for me, since I don’t use energy weapons except very rarely. 
---
That’s an exceptional trade-off.
---
Very true. I love my pink sprinkles donut skin because almost no one else wears it.
---
So it might take a week, maybe even more.. cant wait that long? Well im sure your leaving will strike a significant blow to Bethesda and thenl gaming industry as a whole. I shall tell your tale when you leave sir. The Ballad of Frank, The frustrated gamer.
---
P what?
---
While it sucks that it's been delayed, again, you're honestly not missing much.
---
I’ve failed every attempt so far because no one helps or knows what to do so they just sit there hoping to be carried the whole event..why does no one try to understand mechanics or just look it up beforehand? 😭
---
I recently switched to bloodied/unyielding which helps a bit with this. But otherwise I agree.
---
Pretty annoying.  I’m not even sure the rewards are even worth the effort, I just may forgo the remainder.
---
Take Herd Mentality to get +2 to all your stats. Gets rid of the Strength Penalty and there’s no downside.
---
The vegetarian mutation is pretty good for non-melee builds. Corn soup gives AP refresh and brain fungus soup boosts INT for more XP; both of these foods require little effort to create. There is also cranberry relish for XP bonus, which can be replaced by cranberry cobbler for lazy people like myself.
---
I also run healing factor, but I’m not impressed by it because it doesn’t work during combat.
---
The textures are really low quality imo. I took a pic of the arm because it was clipping through the Pip-Boy and I could count the pixels on the thing.
---
I experience it all the time with my automatic hand-made. Sometimes I can cancel the reload and shoot the last few shots but most of the time it reloads when I have about 7 rounds left.
---
Orange or Spearmint?
---
I died from the Mirelurk Queen over and over as the game soft locked on the respawn screen while it kept killing me. Had to Alt+F4.
---
Stand outside and don't fast travel, should still get rewards, just wait a minute
---
Empath for damage reduction.
---
This is what I do if I'm ready to log off and my main hasn't leveled up.
---
PC
---
You forgot the Harpoon Gun. Executioners FFR. Totally worth it. -\_-
---
Apparently there are multiple Motherlodes, although the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining this. That's why there's still a Motherlode at Breach and Clear, and in The Deep, even after being 'destroyed'.
---
This is a very disappointing start to the event. I'm done for today, and hopefully Bethesda hears there's an issue and address it, or what ever the issue is just fixes itself (try turning it off and on LoL)
---
Yessir totally
---
SO dissapointing, I wanted basically the head of the chally outfit on the back.
---
With the luck I had during faschnacht I hope to god I get some of these plans
---
im at the water south of pleasant valley where a prime cuts is and i went from 4k to 30k in less than an hour.
---
Judging by your post history, my family does not have anything to offer that could get you off.
---
I've just seen the other post and it's quite odd, since I was wearing the Secret Service armor and didn't see that one clipping through the outfit.
---
Someone chopping onions in here
---
Did anyone figure this out? Sitting here looking at keycard, just grays out everytime I try to pick it up.
---
[Don’t put your survival tent hundreds of feet in the air above the pond either!](https://youtu.be/zXzSBrWEH1c)
---
Noooo man, people are already taking advantage of fancy names in crappy stuff to get free caps. I bought a recipe today that I hadn't to disvover that It wasn't a recipe, just a note called "recipe". 1000c T_T
---
Haha I bought some, time to shoot myself.
---
Here is a test,  while mutated equip and then unequip the Fixer while sneaking. Is there a noticeable change?
---
I'm aware, it was just a commentary about the system being poorly conceived.
---
Yet they didn't use the actual model of the things strapped on the back of every Pack Brahmin in the game... just why
---
The harpoon gun is fun
---
No, it would encourage cheating and scamming.
---
Are there any you would say you would absolutely avoid?
---
1000 rounds for gatling laser with the maxed out fusion core duration perk yes.
---
Primal Cuts just fails over and over again so how are we supposed to do meat week? I’ve had it stall out more times than I’ve actually had it work correctly
---
Happened to me in savage divide today, but it was during reset time, so maybe that's why. Also it failed in toxic valley because stupid radtoads were stuck in textures and for some reason running too far away from the event..
---
No skins for pip boy????
---
Lol clearly not enough
---
Correct, you have to finish the heist quest and have access to vault 79 before you start getting notes.
---
The first one is lit
---
It’s not true that there is no benefit. There are three people not trying to kill you. They may even eliminate other players and boost your standings.
---
It’s a dick move though: You shouldn’t do it. It ruins the match for your “team”.
---
I’ve passed 7-8 primal cuts events usually they just spawn a mile away so check map, but even then I can’t pass a single cookout event because no one understands how to do anything and they aren’t bothered to look it up or even try to figure it out. What’s the point of collecting meat if you can’t even pass the event it’s intended for. 😪
---
Correct you need to finish the wastelanders questline in order to get treasury notes from events
---
Anyone here remember the Bloodworms in Fallout 4? Yea those buggers were pretty annoying/deadly. Heres 2 hoping they someday make a return to the game.
---
Yeah it's a nightmare with my Ultracite Gatling Laser. If I don't cancel the reload, I end up with a bunch of quarter-full fusion cores by the end of any event.
---
Nice one xD
---
Ah sorry, I meant to say there are only alterante texture paints for it, not full model swaps like the Fallout 4 or 3 Pip-Boys. Not really sure how to clarify.
---
there ya go, Frank
---
Sure, I’ll love seeing all the “&lt;Offensive slur&gt; Basher”
---
Paging u/ladydevann again .)
---
Contrary to the website "Unstoppables! Outfit Bundle (Fallout 1st) 1,440 720 (50% Off!) August 18 August 25" is not available for F1st...
---
PTS has a player shortage for a number of reasons. First, it's limited to PC players only. I do understand why though. They can and have released multiple PTS patches in a short period of time, which is something just not feasible on consoles. Blame Sony and Microsoft policies for this. Second, some fundamental parts of the game are missing. S.C.O.R.E rewards and Atomic shop items are not available, so there is no way to verify they look &amp; work correctly. Next, the main game is so grindy nowadays that people either don't want to or cannot spend the time testing. Server stability is also a big issue sometimes. I have friends that have given up on PTS because the couple of times they tried, the game/server crashed a lot. Lastly is feedback as the author mentioned. I've submitted bug reports for PTS and the main game, and it's like they disappear in to a black hole, so why even bother.
---
Why would you put someone else’s photo in your loading screens? Just use your own. The photos don’t mean anything if you don’t actually remember being there and having fun, that’s the whole point of the photos as loading screens system
---
Well, what are you waiting for? Start placing stuff!
---
In addition to not screwing over 3 other people, I like soloing to see how high I can get my team placement. Usually top 3 from being a bush wookie.
---
i had to scrap the stuff and rebuild
---
Sometimes I just give up and walk.
---
I took down my door for this reason. Quick Ingress, Quick Egress!
---
I will not abide by your grass-munching ways. It’s also just much easier to spam click mob meat when collecting loot. Don’t want to bother with a farm or clicking around for veggies when I get ample food by just playing.
---
It’s more made for builds that can finish a fight quickly or get into stealth easily. Considering the negative impact is pretty small when you’re gaining that last ho back through saved stimpaks I find it much more useful. The game’s much more enjoyable for me when I don’t have to heal after every encounter
---
False ill fuck anything with a pulse
---
I've done the following at different times:  
---
\--placed a lower level lock, then replaced with the level 3 lock I wanted  
---
\--stored the item and then put it back up again  
---
\--delete item, recreate and put lock on it
---
How did you get a jet pack without power armor
---
Omg yes! I hate when they leave the door open like they havent been taught home training!😂😂
---
Half the reason consoles don't get a PTS is because they can't push patches;  on PC you can watch whenever you want, but for consoles they need to be scheduled and paid for because of service from Microsoft and Sony.
---
Also on PC- had the same issue in the Toxic Valley. It’s been extremely hit or miss
---
Perfect, thanks for this!
---
Only what happened with fasnacht wasn’t game breaking. It just delayed it a day.
---
You need to meet Naked Todd.
---
Naked Todd is born every day and he runs out of Vault 76 like a deranged Clark Kent with his tighty whities, brill creamed hair and highly concealing glasses.
---
He runs past the abandoned homestead, beats down a farmer, take his gun, then goes and heckles Duchess for a good time.
---
He then vanishes. Only to return anew the next day, running out nakie ready to rumble.
---
(I.e new toon, duchess quest/intro, and put a CAMP down... &lt;15mins TOPS)
---
well out of the first 12 i only managed to do 3 as the other 9 failed despite everything being dead. And others had the same problem.
---
Again... just really.
---
This is something I didn’t know about that. I am never not learning something new when it comes to this game and all of it’s interactions.
---
Pub g has one on Xbox there has to be a better way so every update needs to be paid for that just stupid.
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I've only missed two days since the season started due to traveling, and I've never had even a single challenge autocomplete.
---
I've seen the suggestions on how to avoid it within this thread and now I'm even more stumped. On many occasions I've booted into NW first, opened the Legendary Run board, or looked through the Atom Shop before booting into Adventure mode. The only thing I haven't done is be logged in during the time the challenges update.
---
If you sneak, then use photomode you're still registered in the sneak position when using the poses.
---
Anything BOS themed with the survival tent function
---
Putting my money on Grahm. Have you seen him in a fight?
---
You mean tent?
---
Secret service armor. Chest mod, runs on ap not cores
---
I've gotten crafty with different hiding spots over time. Sometimes I pick up quick kits to be a bit more cheeky. But strangely I find myself doing better solo from time to time when I just don't wanna sit there. Probably not having to disappoint the rest of my team soothes the nerves lmao
---
Thanks.  I didn t realize you could just drop a username like that to get someones attention.
---
Learn something new everyday.
---
Nerf to everything never ends in anything else then disaster dont lie to yourself one appalachia may end up being the end of this game
---
IT CAME BACK! YAY!
---
I had a friend open the door for me..
---
Weirdly, I have no issues on PC.
---
You can attach a Jetpack to the Secret Service Torso. You can buy both the Plans from Regs.
---
drum?
---
Empath unless you have 2-3 other teammates you know will use it to with you. The downside is steep
---
Where do you get the secret service armor
---
And when you’re using civilised weapons you lose out. So you have to retaliate in kind or you can’t get anything.
---
I rolled back my Nvidia drivers (the most recent and the one prior have been duds) and my crashes went away and my frame rates improved. (No random slowdowns.)
---
?
---
lately I've become a water wookie. giving the right storm movement, you can get pretty far in the match from staying put.
---
I have been trying for four days now. Cannot progress any further and I’ve just been grinding random enemies but I can’t find any other kind of quests. Basically stuck. I’ve tried every fix suggested but nothing has worked at all.
---
Vault 79 after you finish Wastelanders quests
---
I’m... slightly confused. What would be dead at meat week save critters?
---
What is a reg
---
What Rafa343x said :P
---
Bethesda just need to remove this part of the quest altogether until they have a *well tested* fix for it
---
Finish the wastlanders storyline, collect gold bullion, buy plans from the ss guy, buy legendary modules, craft ss gear. Not so much....
---
He's the guy in Vault 79 that you can trade with. (Gold Bullions).How far in are you?
---
I can safely assure you I am not helping my 2 afk teammates by unknowingly running into an entire team of 4 or more commonly walking in the middle of an entire shootout.
---
I see where you are coming from of course.
---
Yes. https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
I dunno, it's flattering someone wants to use my photos :P
---
Thanks :)
---
Yes, but no guarantees
---
I prefer glue, but I guess everyone uses what they like xD
---
I'd say it was worth the risk X)
---
Agreed. It’s so frustrating too because it’s such an easy task, just click the button, but I can’t do it and I’m just locked completely.
---
Prime cuts
---
I do have my own photos in it, but they are mostly about my past camps and little else, I'm not too good with this whole business and rather than watching the same 20 or so photos every time I fast travel, I like filling the gallery wth artworks and beautiful photos from the community. I sometimes make custom frames for photos that fit a specific theme, and this one looks just like a promotional pic for the event, so it goes really well with all my other event themed loading screens.
---
Life went back to normal...? Where are you lol
---
And as a result we now can’t access content we paid for.
---
A water wookie? What gives it that distinction? 
---
I guess by the logic I am assuming I would be an urban/camp wookie.
---
I’ve actually set up a purposely made system for this. When my vendors go live the same circuit opens up the doors I allow the general public in through. The doors to my personal floors are physically locked with a key, except for the entrance from the shop up to the living areas. 
---
Takes some fiddling as the conduits are useless at transcending floors but it works well.
---
It's a unique 2H melee weapon with three unique mods. It's not truly significant on it's own, but it is very big and loud. Up until this year, it made a great wall hanging. I'm very stoked for legendary effects as of this year though.
---
That's a fire hazard my friend, it's worse than smoking in bed....
---
I am far enoguh to get gold bullion but i havent't played a lot since i played at launch i was there when nothing was in the game so when i completed the main quests so i stopped playing and now i finally came back
---
Its a start! The more you do it the more you will see what else you can do!
---
I had them both on and neither applied.
---
Imagine if they did! Then we'd have some immersive nuclear bunkers camps everywhere xD
---
It's bugged, there's ways to get it to work. This answer is a good start https://nerdburglars.net/question/required-blood-sample-is-not-loaded-in-the-centrifuge-quest-bug/
---
I tested both the firewoks that i got from last year meat week and the legendary run, and only the legendary run ones work. They are different.
---
Your awesome. Thank you!
---
Has that been confirmed to work on yourself?
---
Power armor only.
---
Oh. Well... that sucks. Probably a respawning bug.
---
I guess I did speak too soon.
---
Yea bringing aid...i believe it....unless they had already mugged and raided every settlement before the sierra bravos sent them to their maker.   The brotherhood have  abused our great lands before we will not fall for the propaganda.  I cannt wait to start collecting holo tags of fallen knights.
---
Thank you mate
---
Probably anywhere but the US... ;)
---
I think one of the waves creatures spawns insanely far away, so you can't ever kill it.
---
Also had one fail and afterwards I saw some blood eagles were fighting a prime fog crawler about 300m from the event, that's why that one failed.
---
Yeah. You get the 25% dr and you can reduce the 33% damage increase below 25%.
---
I’m not even grinding it once.
---
Ironically the us, but I went back to working 40 hours a week, not 10 like I did for a few months. Let’s say normalish
---
They’re greedy but they’re not quite EA. Yet.
---
I posted about it and ladydevann replied, so they know.
---
I suuuuck at NW, but I enjoy it from time to time. I’ve started going in solo simply out of fear of disappointing my team  😂😂
---
[those of us who have already maxed reputation and completed the grind](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aab8a0699616ac94346c05f667b40844e46322f/0_123_5616_3432/master/5616.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a476da702aff265ce6f586be1412b1e1)
---
Or greedy.
---
Approaching robot, have a none modified camera.  I had a modified one and the event wasn't triggering, crafted another base camera and the event showed up when close to the house.
---
This event is trash from what I’m seeing so idc is ever comes. Perk Loadouts and One App is all I’m interested in
---
I dont see it either and im FO1st on xbox one
---
**Chameleon**, since you can only use particular armors with it, and the effect is essentially the same with certain legendary armor effects or even the Chinese Stealth Suit. 
---
**Plague Walker**, since you have to intentionally have disease for it to work, and the negative effects of disease are more annoying than the Poison Aura is helpful. 
---
The rest all have some benefits that can be useful. It’s really just those two I say to *hide from and avoid like the plague*.
---
There is no defending this.  I love 76 and fallout.  But you were so wrong Peter Hinesight. 
---
One can argue a live service needs a revenue stream.  But surely they projected that it isn't sustainable offering free stuff all the time.
---
Yep, made tormentor my friend again.
---
Just don't buy Starfield or the next Elder Scrolls until/unless 76 is given the attention it deserves.  If they can't prove themselves on this one, the next titles will be just as bad.
---
Come now! They’re greedy but they’re not EA. Yet.
---
Stacks with speed demon and faster reload speeds
---
Interesting. I’ll have to consider adding that.
---
Yea I've seen that. I have some other weapons that have "magic" effects but I dont see the crazy damage they are claiming to have
---
This is what I do when I just want to get into NW to place camps xD
---
Damn..i hope it gets fixed soon
---
I do too, dont worry you are not alone. The only reasons I'm in teams is cause frankly I'm kinda bored of silence and kinda wanna help people. Practice communication in a time where talking to people other than my family is rare.
---
SS Mods...that’s literally all I wanted.
---
Those are the toxic little kids who think its funny to ruin the game for everyone else and its just sad. Wasting resources for what, a sad little joke? Idk shit like this passes me off!
---
Nah rarely ever happens. It's a complete waste of a nuke if they do that. Most people you encounter in this game are good people. Safe travels!
---
Fuck this event, tried 3 times now and for some reason after wave 2 it says event failed. Fuck it
---
I've only seen a nuke used almost exclusively in two places. One spawns a boss the other is for collecting crafting materials. The odds of you or your camp getting hit are almost zero.
---
The fact you mentioned anus in holding it up says a LOT about you. 😆
---
What are you selling? I've heard some people will do this if they don't like your vendor prices.
---
Same with  Ultracite Gatling plasma. I'm so sick of switching in the middle of a tough fight, but I'd rather do that than throw away expensive cores.
---
prime cuts events. which gives prime meats. part of meat week
---
Precisely, you don't even need to stay you just join place a camp and leave. Though I just place a bunch of walls and wait to see who bothers breaking down the barriers.
---
Oh hehe. :) Well solo would be fair if everyone were solo. But i have been ganked by enemy teams so many times because random teammates rarely want to work as a team.
---
There are 2 locations that are usually nuked. One is in a place called whitesprings which is usually popular for camp building but people nuke it because it is a good xp farm after you nuke it. The second place is for a boss fight and is out of the way from camp building. Some people get salty and will try to nuke your base if you smack them in pvp though. Thing is you can check where a nuke is going to land before it hits and just leave servers if it’s going to hit your base. You have about 30 seconds after the warning that a nuke has been launched. Not really an issue I’d say.
---
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Also it was declared non-canon by Bethesda.
---
No, but you always get a warning giving you 2 minutes before the bomb hits and you can see on the map where it's going to hit. Worst case scenario, just log out.
---
That only leaves the survival tent unless they do something like add those items to the BOS bunker graphic and use it in place of that graphic.
---
I'm a bit tired of the tent to be honest.
---
I don't understand what backup you need against the use of something that's literally cheating. Aimbot/VATS is bad in multiplayer games, especially PvP, because it autolocks on to the enemy. In PvP it's unfair in every aspect. Might as well play the game with a macro or cheat program.
---
&gt;Bethedsa even give us the option to not use it in Nuclear Winter.
---
It's great that they recognized that it wouldn't be suitable for a PvP mode. 
---
VATS is a feature that made total sense in a top down RPG, but it's not something that's good for online shooters.
---
&gt;You're just repeating yourself 
---
Because it doesn't seem like you read. Exhibit A:
---
&gt;You: you probably whore it out in pve 
---
&gt;Me earlier: I don't
---
I'm seeing a lot of varying difficulty in the prime hunts even though every event marker I see reads "easy". Solo'd my first one and it was like a bunch of lv10 wolves or something pretty trivial, jumped into the next one without my PA on and got fucken wrecked by two lv80 yao gui. I think the one near vault 76 is the easy one, the ones up by Crater and down by the earth mover and legendary exchange are intermediate, and the one in the hills east of whitesprings is the bears one. There's more than the 4 I've played thus far I know just wanted to give people a heads-up the listed difficulty doesn't mean anything.
---
Well in all honesty sometimes I forget to put it off and the team finder turns on every time you switch game modes. I'll stay with my team till the end tho.
---
It's a great promo pic
---
I just got Herbivore yesterday.    
---
It's much easier to fill the food meter anytime. Corn soup is what I've been using forever with Super Duper maxed out. With Green Thumb you get 2x plants and Woodchucker gives a lot of wood. All you need is a few minutes and you can have a lot of it
---
please no
---
You need good perks for your guns. If your combat rifle is automatic you should stick to it and get commando perks. It's better to have 3 level 1 commando cards that 1 level 3.
---
There are other perks that can increase your damage like adrenaline, gun fu and bloody mess.
---
Of course you need a better gun. For a beginner an instigating combat rifle, fixer or handmade rifle would be a golden catch.
---
Edit: spelling
---
I mean the functions of the tent yes but hopefully using a different art asset.  Like all the functions of the tent but in the BOS bunker?
---
Even though I may be in the minority, I’d even take a communist theme survival tent
---
Just a psa: if you know the event is going to fail; Bail and find a new world. It generally takes longer to finish the event than to fail it. If you’re fast enough you can find another world with an event going far better. I’ve saved it a few times doing that today.
---
It seems the timer isn’t long enough. I played a couple and we were like 3/4 of the way through the final wave and ran out of time. It easily could’ve been completed, but oh well, Todd logic 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh trust me, I'm not getting at people for making mistakes. Was just frustrated and wanted to genuinely tell people the button was there while being snarky about it to blow off some steam.
---
Same. I also need the next patch for the ultra light weight mods 😂
---
I have first and it's not in my shop either
---
Ah, just like the vault raids were a permanent feature...
---
I'd be more into the Communist group if it was the Russians running the show but I know that isnt how the Fallout story goes.
---
There's a section of the map (the starting area) that is un-nukable. So if you *really* wanted to make sure that this never happens to you, then you can just build your base there.  
---
It's a decently picturesque area, and the enemy mobs are all super low level.
---
I know, I'm just saying that they can forget too. And sometimes something irl happens and people need to afk. I know you mean people who do that on purpose, but not everyone's who's afk is doing it on purpose :)
---
Weapon:
---
1 star - 5
---
2 srar - 15

3 star - 40

Armor:

1 star - 3

3 star - 24

Iirc
---
It takes 2 minutes for the nuke to hit your camp plenty of time for you to switch servers.
---
I sell ammo for 1 cap each and then chems for 2 and 3 caps each. All my plans are also 10 caps each. That’s all I sell. So I’m just confused as to why my camp😅
---
Wait til you hit level 500 and need to level up every day...I felt like a true Junkie with the amount of XP and Intelligence buffs I was running.
---
It would be really cool if we could paint and name a weapon, lock it, so that it can never be repainted or renamed, then sell it getting by the usual lock on atomic shop skins.
---
Only time anyone wastes a nuke on a specific target like that is because the target did something, did you run an event and one shot all the legendaries are you selling the sequin red dresses for 25k toilet paper for 30k or perfectly preserved pies for 20k , take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself why someone would waste a nuke on you and try to fix it. I can’t be sympathetic because I don’t know why you got nuked , for all we know you have some racist shit in neon letters across the entrance to your camp
---
Yea I agree, but the red army stuff in this game is pretty cool imo
---
You failing to take into account players like me. Who only do nw for the score. Then once that’s done. Leave
---
Now if only the Primal Cut events weren't broken 75% of the time.
---
We’ve all done that. Usually with armour
---
Unless the empath mutation was changed recently, there is no downside so long as you are on a team because you count as your own teammate. With Class Freak, you get damage reduction from your own mutation.
---

Lol nothing says "stay the fuck away" better than a cazador! My favorite enemy in all of fall out.. when you seen these you immediately knew shit was about to go down. We need monsters to strike fear in us again.. and a cazador can do the job just fine!
---
Bored
---
Perfect let me guess another delay right?
---
It happened to most of us. Bought a god roll weapon for something like 4k only to realise it was 40 lvls. Ofc 10 lvls difference isn't that much and in theory you can still use it, but it still sucks.
---
I was away from my game for a couple minutes during that time. That’s why I didn’t switch servers.
---
I did the cookout for the first ime ever today. Out of 5 Primal Cut missions, 2 glitched out and 'failed' despite plenty of time left. I had enough meat to slap on the grill and then banged a drum for over a minute.    
---
I got 3 plans: Meat Cleaver, Meat Weak Stein, and the display from just that one time.
---
Give me more stash space and I'll think about it.
---
They really should rename them to "Nuisances" since most of them are not challenging.
---
Place a different lv lock on them , if it was at three go to two or zero
---
Ask first if he’s okay with taking your meat.
---
Same here. I’m honestly pissed. Every single little thing in my camp is destroyed ugh :/ you step away for 3 minutes and someone nukes your camp
---
I love the game, but the state of the game, and the people defending this, is awful. God I want them to just spend 8 weeks pumping out QA patches.
---
“Mosquito protection on a budget”
---
Yeah exactly. It will become even worse if they do that. Hope it won't happen while I'm still playing this game (I will stop someday, right?).
---
Two times died during single event and respawned in the cave
---
Then, when wc was killed died one more time and respawned outside, so I couldn't get rewards from the chest
---
That explains why your mom’s breath smelled so nice...
---
I would avoid unstable isotope. Most enemies are rad resistant and this mutation will cause 10 damage to you when it triggers.
---
I've found several issues in both events
---
Yeah I feel your pain, have been solo in the final 10 too many times where my team have all wiped out. Once you realise its a squad or 2 you have no chance really
---
I think you'll be surprised by The community. Most People would rather do all they can to help you during your early levels than do anything to harm you. Plus it can be expensive or time consuming to launch nukes, so People really dont want to waste nukes. Just dont place your camp in whitesprings, by fissure site prime or by the mine where the soon to be release event "a colossal problem" and you're fine.
---
Yea I really start to wonder if maybe mine is really the only world and there are only 20 players in the world.. Have to wonder..
---
Yeah seeing how they handled fallout 76 and the creation club crushed my hopes, and I'm a long time ES fan. I have a very bad feeling that they'll likely stick tons of gameplay stuff behind the creation club and make the game really shallow. It'll probably be like skyrim with less RPG elements. I hope I'm wrong, I really want to be wrong. I want more RPG, the daggerfall RPG system, but I know it's not going to happen.
---
The same way you can’t tell people not to kill all 40 Scorched before they’ve even landed meaning the low levels can’t throw in a Molotov to get their tags in.
---
Yes that a good trade 
---
I normally carry 25-50 on me at a time and it last me a few days
---
Mutations completely depend on builds , my stealth rifleman uses like 3 my melee fist fighter had a bunch. Marsupial and speed demon are definitely the top two tho , you really can’t go wrong with them
---
Cyberpunk is around the corner mate
---
The TP roll has to face out not against the wall. Savages.
---
Oh bethesda...
---
Maybe if I stop wasting money on FO76 I will afford it xD Thanks for reminding me, almost forgot about it
---
well if you drop it in a your bag it actually disappears instead or dropping in the world lol i know it's a pain but if we all do it we can have great meat week!
---
Or Bethesda can fix it and it stops being an issue.
---
Please don't blame players for a Bethesda problem.
---
Avoid flatulency at all cost
---
Not everyone uses the newer reddit layout on pc or is on mobile, jackass.
---
when did i blame them this is a joke lol
---
If you're having fun, it's not a bad idea.
---
if you're getting spotted then you're doing something wrong.
---
the SS is generally bad for sneaking purposes as it lacks shadowed and muffled mods.
---
I took a little walk round the outside of the map today. It was refreshing, knowing almost nobody else has ever been there before.
---
Truly unique.  So much potential.  If they can't support it properly, maybe they should sell it to another company who will.
---
This; it's ideal for heavy gunners, and the gatling gun is probably the most resource-efficient ranged weapon in the game.
---
That's not why I went PA, though. I went PA because it's cool as hell. I'm trying to channel my inner Astartes in Appalachia.
---
What's there to fix? Creatures in the event have quest markers on hud, just need to pay attention
---
You can do it!
---
Because of this I put the jail doors on all my areas and locked them. The workshop and vendor area is open without any doors. But this way People can see my stuff but not leave my doors open.
---
😥
---
If you're having fun, then you're doing it right.
---
Of all the creatures in the game I hate these little ugly   rats the most. Fucking hate them, especially when they spawn inside my camp out of nowhere and start destroying stuff from inside the textures. I spent so much time building it and not gonna move it because of some fat hairless dirt sausages.. Annoying during the event too, they're just everywhere.
---
you're right I was looking at her (not he surely!?) from the other side!
---
My guy...if that's the problem then they spawn OUT of the event...we can see a marker... we're not stupid...the problem is that since they spawn out of the event, they don't have a marker...
---
Secret service is great. Stealth suit is a glorified hazmat, don’t get me wrong, still useful but very expensive to buy.
---
wish me luck!
---
Actually that's exactly who I am taking into account. 
---
You can get the score without joining a team.
---
I don't get the "magic" hype either. Even the evidence shown in youtube videos is self-defeating. It just isn't that big a difference. Love to know how people are melting SBQ though, haven't seen any video explanation of that
---
I run a CSS in a silo and am never above "Caution". They can't kill you if they can't detect you. I recommend the CSS, but I am biased in that I don't have a set of SS. I don't notice a lot of a difference when my DR is higher or I'm in a CSS, but it might be playstyles too.
---
Yep but so much easier to drop right next to a teammate for extra security.
---
I've seen no issues with both events on PS4
---
Cool idea. I'd be happy just to have the vanilla game working as advertised.
---
I've found some really strange constructions, but not yours.   I usually just leave weird comments in neon letters.
---
Well by the sounds of it you are putting in more effort than who I'm angry at.
---
Gourd and corn soup, pumpkin is okay too. I also like sweet tato stew but it needs sugar.
---
Maybe. I’ve actually won a match with a high level. I just basically acted as bait and drew the player into the open and the high level killed. Revived me. Repeat. Worked well lol.
---
Beth is against that.
---
This time around you take rad-damage, no matter your resistance, if you go afk on the spits.
---
I dont even care anymore if its delayed on consoles again i totally lost my interest in the event and the short quest.When i first heard about it i was jumping out of my chair and now i dont even care anymore tbh.
---
There is a mod for that, one that is so popular bethesda is gonna copy their homework. [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/5fegxS7x33B7Tjb01IJU8L/f9fbc727ec2a7116626541fd9f7429b4/Fallout76\_Year2\_Winter.jpg?q=70&amp;&amp;&amp;fm=webp](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/5fegxS7x33B7Tjb01IJU8L/f9fbc727ec2a7116626541fd9f7429b4/Fallout76_Year2_Winter.jpg?q=70&amp;&amp;&amp;fm=webp)
---
You could’ve gotten the CSS for free...
---
I thought I was going crazy. Things keep disappearing on me. I lost my modded T-60 chest armor and thought maybe I'd accidentally scraped it somehow but I had no idea how.  
---
Then I lost a Gatling Plasma... I reported it going missing and they just responded with "we can't replace your weapon".  Whatever, it was easy enough to replace. But now I'm wondering what's the next thing to go all the time.
---
I just lost Glowing Resin in the middle of trying to make some vodka... had it... then I didn't.  At least this time I had video and I was able to go back and see I didn't do anything to lose it.  I'm not asking for replacement but I'm really nervous I'm going to lose something I don't want to lose. 
---
Please fix this!
---
I just recently got back into 76, so I don’t know what CSS is, please help me know what you mean.
---
That's not only effort but a concrete strategy. Yeah the people I'm talking about is people who just join a team and stay still. You probably did more for that high level player that most other people would.
---
So you're saying it's not that big of a benefit so we should gate it with a gigantic grind???
---
So, we need to find a way to team up with other AFKers...
---
Classic Bethesda, I honestly have no idea where they would be if they didn’t have the moding community doing their job for them.
---
I haven't gotten repair kits from SBQ event in a few months now.
---
Chinese Stealth Suit, sorry!

And here's the fucking problem, there's at least three or four fast travel bugs of varying annoyance and severity.  When people make generic complaints that doesn't fucking help.  If you're going to report or even just whine about a bug you at least have to give people a fucking clue as to what you're talking about.
---
Or just stand in the dumpster .)
---
Nah, we had no tents at Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog. Those things are spawning way outside the normal radius compared to Forest/The Mire/Toxic Valley
---
Making thing go boom = fun
---
Right. Thats what I'm trying to figure out. I melted a 2* SB with a bloodied minigun &gt; 200 fr with "magic" effects and thought i finally had something special. Got to the SQB... nope.
---
Buy nothing but legendary modules with your script. Use CSS while you're trying to roll the best sneak SS.
---
No it’s okay, I have it and my Stealth is max. I did the settlers story due to that and I don’t really like the raiders.
---
Don't be afk?
---
This should be first thing it checks when joining a server.
---
The tenderizer plans and mods for it seem to be the rare rewards.
---
Nah,i rarely see a nuke being dropped on someone's camp.But there are a few locations where you shouldn't build near.first one is whitesprings because people tend to nuke it for exp,second one is the fissure site at the right corner of the map because there is a endgame boss there and the third one is monongah mine because there is a endgame boss there too with the latest patch.
---
Hope this helped you.
---
If you combine it with the outfit then it makes perfect sense xD I also didn't expect this, but I still want it. looks weird, I like weird.
---
It’s on the roadmap for winter this year
---
Yeah, earn it. It's not difficult, it gives something to strive for.  You won't die without it, it's just a nice perk of having WORKED for it.
---
Yes I don't see the point of the PTS if they just push shit code to production anyway.  Waste of everyone's time.
---
&gt;So ask please clean up after yourselves for all our sakes lets keep Appalachia green!
---
...because if you don't, you're the one creating the game lag.
---
You appeal to players to not lag the game &amp; not appeal to Bethesda to improve server optimisation or item clean up.
---
So yeah, you're blaming the players for the lag.
---
Oh it'll be stylish as hell, but don't expect it to help you kill things faster. All the explode-on-death perks are the worst of the bunch.
---
I thought it was because we killed the boss before all the other ones but im guessing thats not the case ...
---
At this point I think they are trying to kill off the game.
---
I’m confused with what you are trying to say. Drumming is useful
---
Im afk with 2 accounts on drums usually on the same server, that being said, when I do have time to sit down and participate, I don't ever see anyone not doing anything. People either do the spit, drums, or whatever else. This is Xbox though.
---
It was for 3 minutes? I bet you’ve stepped away from your game at some point for 5 minutes or less. We’ve all done it :/ doesn’t make it ok to nuke someone’s camp. Plus, someone I lived with needed help with someone that was kinda important. Pretty sure we’ve all done that too while we were playing a game.
---
That’s good to know though road maps seem to not be very reliable. At least it’s presumably on the way.
---
When Grahm’s meat cook starts on the hour, go do the event. Donate the meat to the grill, 5 at a time.
---
Why tf are people plopping down tents right next to the event? Or is it being ridiculous and a tent 500 feet away is throwing off the spawns?
---
There's nothing wrong with having overpriced things in vendors.
---
At the new event “grahms cookout” you turn it into scrip at the fire pit. 
---
Be careful tho. They spoil pretty fast!
---
Honestly I don't think anyone ever complained about it, maybe like a few people. I have a feeling they changed it for the sake of changing it, like "hey look, we'll make a change (that nobody really asked for) to make it look like we care (we don't)!".
---
No, I haven't.  If I need to step away, I just go to the main menu.
---
It’s for the meat weak event that procs at the top of the hour.  When the event starts, you’ll see graham by the bbq pit - that’s where you turn in your prime meat.
---
The event is just southwest of vault 76.
---
I've noticed that but when I pay attention to see it happen it does run down to zero before reloading, but shows a weird number until the reload is completed.
---
Well someone just nuked primal cuts event. Ffs 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
I think if I get to a level where it's annoying to level up everyday, I'll introduce the world to Naked Tara.
---
Or just look at the time every now and then?
---
During the main event (the one thats by vault 76 once a hour) Turn them into the big BBQ in the center. You get script and points towards the event.
---
Imagine him destroying the army of PA and ripping the elders head off and declaring a new trade federation. The stuff of dreams
---
Where is the BBQ pit? I didnt see the cookout pop up at beginning of last hour. May have missed it
---
Check the ATX datamine.  There's one in the files.
---
My only gripe with the CSS is that I can't wear an outfit over it ...
---
I run both a Bloodied Commando and a Junkies Commando with it and adore it. If I'm just scavenging, I'll wear just whatever armour I've got, and then hop into the suit when I wanna sneak around. A full set of weightless on my Junkies keeps stash space pretty open.
---
So as someone with a solo 6 second queen kill, the effect can become very very very pronounced when the servers are under a specific amount of duress.
---
As a junkie heavy build, most all of my weapons are magic plain and simple.  Sometimes the effect is just a bit more damage per burst on top of whatever I'm already doing, sometimes I melt the queen in 6 seconds with a point blank AA Bashing 90 gauss minigun barrage.
---
Basically theres a lot of uncertainty at play and it's better to say that they have the potential to melt, but dont do so all the time.  I have never killed the queen faster than that one time, and never have since despite trying to do so again.
---
And kill all the spawned enemies before you do.
---
In the center of the event.
---
Awesome crib bud!
---
I'm mystified as well.  Was going to mail them a copy of Quality Assurance for Dummies, but I think it's a management problem.  They aren't interested in allocating the resources this truly unique game deserves.
---
That works too but I don’t pay attention to the time while I’m playing
---
If I recall correctly, they were making increasingly higher demands because the Scorched were only growing stronger and stronger.
---
Well as someone with a BFFR fixer and BE gat plasma, I have to say I’m excited that enemies will die in 0.5 seconds as opposed to 0.05 second
---
Looks like a great horror movie villain
---
They are saving the best for last.
---
Same, happened to me a few times already. It seems like it's a bug with the spawns; on one occasion, I noticed an invisible, unkillable prime enemy, but it wasn't marked with a quest marker or on the compass and I only found it because I just so happened to aim in its direction.
---
You misunderstand me. Where in Appalachia is the !symbol for this event?
---
Yes. He fought my camp. Then he went hostile to me as well, and he was still invincible the bastard, or I’d have had to have melted him.
---
Ok tinkerbell how about if you don’t know or experience this then move along sweetie. 
---
Your virtual armchair bs is not required here.
---
omg you do these on a low level character you spin up for this purpose, not on your main.
---
1k caps
---
I usually sell them for about 400 caps each
---
Oh my god what a hero, you're so cool.
---
This virtue signaling BS is so weird. No one cares.
---
To me it feels like an under armor, and you should wear some armor with it other than the helmet.
---
Its not out yet but they made a post about 2 hours ago saying it will be live on consoles next week...
---
They delayed it again..
---
My bet is that they will release it next year anyone wanna bet?
---
It’s the cooking spit with the Yao gaui on it. And a big super mutant cooking pot beside that spit too. Those are the two spots you can turn the prime meat in and get the meat sweats!
---
Sugar bombs RAD are the hardest to farm! 
---
Especially how many you need to make brain bombs
---
But they are worth it
---
Just southwest of vault 76 - where you begin the game.  It will be the usual public event symbol.
---
Where did you get that?
---
Meat week? You don’t want a tenderizer plan or cow grill?
---
I understand it's a glitch, but I am really loving it with my TS lever action. The loading animation is pretty enjoyable. :D
---
ok
---
Has anyone datamined the chance the event has of automatically failing yet?
---
I have both (full unyielding SS) and would strongly recommend the CSS first.   It's a gamechanger.
---
Yah, I had seen that with the only issue being his stats were showing a 25% dmg increase when it is actually 33% in-game. Not sure if it was that way before public teams or not tho. You’ll need at least 1 teammate with empath to get the same results as far as I’m aware. So he may be at a disadvantage if he’s playing with fandoms on a public team.
---
Why thank you, not very "Raidery" mind :-)
---
What’s that from??
---
But we need to drop spoiled meat at peoples vendors with ridiculous prices...
---
Private teams, not public teams, because in private teams they can spam those in your camp as well and you can't get rid of them without replacing your camp
---
having the same issue. did you by any chance find a solution? this is so frustraing
---
I haven’t either in PC. We’re in the minority, I guess.
---
I had this happen in the Savage Divide but then had a normal completion in the Bog — seems like it’s random? I did hop servers after the failed one so maybe that helps?
---
nm
---
Colossal Problem reward
---
Did it just fine this afternoon. They all will work as I have done all of them. However sometimes I can’t find the strangling mobs and the timer runs out. The mobs can spawn away from the meat lure and not move towards you. Get proactive and hunt them down.
---
Honestly at that point they might be better off just scrapping fast travel costs all together
---
You will definitely not be banned. 
---
But to be sure don’t hang around with “exploiters”. 
---
I would leave the server if I was you... but maybe that’s just me. 
---
I do everything not to get involved in such things.
---
People in public teams cannot place things at your camp.
---
Just did it a few minutes ago. I dont think the failing is location specific
---
Patch 22 fixes it
---
All but 1 primal meat event has had issues with mobs not showing up no matter how far we search, so no meat to give.
---
Also failed a meat week event randomly for no reason.
---
I also do this!
---
all of them can be broken.
---
Haha I think I may just do that!
---
Mmm is it really that simple?
---
Hmm I just did it twice without any problems. 
---
Tbh I think this can happen at all events... 
---
seems like people are having mixed experiences
---
I sure miss being able to cripple the antennas and watching them attack each other with fire...
---
Power Armor doesn’t work for bloodied builds, hence people whining that it’s garbage. You’ll find that Power Armor is actually very useful, if not necessary, for casual builds to be effective in dangerous areas. I’m a bit above level 200 and I would never walk into a SBQ fight without my T51-b on.
---
It seems to fix after rejoining server.
---
Looks dope!!!
---
Some of the mobs are spawning hella far from the center.
---
I've only been getting the head to that
---
Sorry forgot to mention I was playing with a steam friend as he gifted me the game for my birthday
---
You need to own the normal one also
---
That sounds fun
---
I'm dreading the changes too.
---
Go event hop or farm primal cuts for scrip. Or go make a new character and go through the story again
---
The normal jetpack plan or the normal Captain Cosmos jetpack plan?
---
Every IRL hour or ingame hour?
---
If someone did place this at your camp, make sure they dont place anymore. The ammo factory will take up your camp budget and cant be removed. Even when you move your camp the ammo factory will be permanently taking up your camp budget. 
---
But no, you wont be banned
---
The Fasnact collectron spits out one or two every hour. He also finds enough other prewar food and booze that you don't even really need a farm (as long as you don't mind being an alcoholic).
---
Do you know the base version of the Jetpack you are trying to craft?
---
For example, you can't put the Dark Matter Jetpack on T-65 Armor if you don't know how to make a normal T-65 Jetpack.
---
Plus Bethesda has admitted that the area around Vault 76 and Flatwoods runs smoother by design, far less framerate problems
---
You have 40 scrip slowly rotting in your inventory. Turn it in at the grills in the center.
---
Keep your doors open so we can monitor you.
---
That’s where I was Pie-nabbed :(
---
no you're saying im blaming the players of course it's bethesdas fault im simply making a suggestion to help the predicament we find ourselves in because of their incompetence if you wnna take it the wrong way that's on you
---
I wouldnt buy them for more than 50-100 each tbh, but you might get someone to buy for more if theyre unaware that fasnacht will happen again next year.
---
It's not a soup, but raw melons give you something like 25% food and 20% water. Just eat a few any time you're at camp, no cooking required.
---
No, I mean you used the wrong spelling.
---
Bingo
---
Yeah probably
---
South West of Vault 76 and North West of Moonshiners shack.
---
A lot of people are putting tents in the middle of the event, or close to it. Why, I don’t know.
---
No, but you'd think they'd be able to do a search of particular CAMP objects that have been created in all the worlds and then ban players with it, or remove it from CAMPs at least.
---
So they stole more and more....while weakening possible allies.......got it....
---
LOL Got 'em!!
---
F raidery, home needs to feel home and you caught that feeling 🤙
---
This has been patched in the PTS from what I’ve heard so it’s likely they’ll be useless after patch 22
---
Thx!
---
He only placed the one.
---
Sweet!
---
Didn't it just happen to them on one of their game play videos? You'd think the embarrassment of that would be enough to push it to the top of the list.
---
Meat cook is on the hour every hour.
---
yea I had a guy buy a jester mask off me for 10k even though I told him fashnact will happen next year.
---
I always close the door, even if the camp owner is inside and was the person who left the door open
---
Ah yes.... “someone” ;)
---
You know how we know you’re lying? You can’t build on a public teammate’s camp
---
Probably to stand on so they can't get hit, which throws enemy AI and spawns off like the SBQ, ugh.
---
lol, nice one.
---
I'm about to get rid of the old man now at my camp if he keeps opening every door and leaving it open.
---
It did yeah while they was live streaming “A Colossal Problem”
---
It’s honestly ridiculous at this point. We are nearly at the end of this event. An event that becomes progressively harder so that when you lose out on SCORE points it just puts you at a huge disadvantage. Even trying to max out XP by using Inspirational perk x3, cranberry relish, moth man event, resting at CAMP it still takes hours to make headway in the repeatable. I really wanted to finish this on my own and not buy ranks. Now I don’t know if that will be possible. I’m level 81 now. Just really demotivating, since we all know Bethesda won’t be doing any kind of changes or refunding anything for those hit by the autocomplete bug.
---
Especially if bloodied
---
Always chase them down. I rolled with a group for a few hours, two man teams running in each direction, then holding down the legendary if it appesrs for thr other teams to arrive. 
---
New experience from public teams when we werent even all on the same team. Just seemed like everyone was working together and helping all.
---
I didnt know the different variations of the collectron s give different things till it was too late, so I'll have to wait till it comes back into the atom shop-if it does hopefully
---
Always have been
---
It appears as though you live in a fragile state.
---
Reading comprehension, try it.
---
Not all of them do. That’s the problem. You need to be proactive and kill everything that moves in the area.
---
Given that the head of the Expedition Force believes in helping people before her own oath as a BoS member, i'd assume we could at least show her the good that is in Grahm's big mutated heart. Plus if anything I could see Grahm being like how Curie was in Fallout 4, i.e. allowing the BoS to study them (without any form of dissection that is).
---
The Brotherhood were the front line of defence against the scorched, which were primarily based in the Bog. If anyone caused the downfall of Appalachia it was the Raiders. They killed the dude who had crucial information about the Scorched en route to the Free States, then destroyed Charleston which put an immense strain on the Responders’ resources - far more than the Brotherhood ever did. And where were the technologically superior Enclave while all this was happening?
---
I got the stealth suit and the Perk card with the vault boy in the suit of armour maxed out for better damage resistance when not in PA. Works well. At level 75, I can take head on maybe two or three level 60+ enemies, but most times I don't need to with my Max sneak card stacks.
---
Other than myself launching nukes at my buddies’ camps for fun, I’ve only seen it done one other time.
---
Thanks for the info all!
---
I hide underwater
---
Cool.  You were on a private team then.  Be careful of who you team up with privately as they can do shit like this to you.
---
Nice of him to gift you the game for your birthday but dick move installing the ammo factory.
---
I agree- I've had it fail in several different locations- no consistency to it.
---
Do you take part in all the public events that pop up? I bounce between doing those and scrap runs and building, it’s always fun to tear down your camp and start again
---
Hate to break it to you but radtoads can open doors. Pretty sure all monsters can. Wolves and rats do it at my camp all the time.
---
Lmao no. When that huge weapon dupe came out a few months ago, lots of people who had gotten suspended/banned got their accounts back shortly after appealing it. My boyfriend transferred dozens of legacy weapons onto my characters to hold and I have never been banned/suspended and the weapons are still there. I’ve never experienced or heard of Bethesda banning people for association.
---
I nuked the spot 3 times last night and on the last one only 3 others showed up and by the time we finally killed the WC it was super graphic laggy from all of the normal wendigo's, I like the running screaming emote it forces you to do!
---
Sorry to tell you this but they delayed it on consoles again.about 2 hours ago they made a post saying how to need additional time to release it so they will release it next week..but with bethesda we all know next week means next month..Its stupid how they made me lose all my interest in the event and i haven't even played it once.
---
So first time I got to do event being last year I was taking my break. So I go up near raiders camp and first event goes perfect second the last boss never showed even tho I’m pretty sure it was another level 32 ghoul like first event and I killed it but still time ran out and event failed
---
You unlock atoms as you go, using the gameboard.
---
You can also delete it but it will take away one percent of your camp budget until there is a work around to get rid of it for good.   One factory won't lag the server on its own.
---
Did it come as a reward for completing the event, or is it looted off earle at the end?
---
Meanwhile I came across a guy with about 40 of them who had "Free Ammo" signs up. He gave a bunch of new players ammo, aid, and legendaries. Even dropped me a lot of 5.56 which I used to help some new players take down their first SBQ after clearing the silo for them. I'm not going to fault a guy who uses a bug to benefit the community.
---
Yup, door knobs are tricky, don't have that kind of time to invest. Wasteland is a busy, hectic place.
---
Irl
---
Personally I like this one much more than "placing 5 wooden foundations" or "eat a gum"
---
At least motivates me to explore , go on hunt, farm some mats, do events.
---
It's literally not a problem at all for me, I just do my stuff and level happens. 168 ATM
---
Join event team, drink up cranberry relish and gourd soup and voila. 1,1k exp per event
---
There are programs you can run on your pc to induce lag in the game and help magic weapons.
---
In this event all hell breaks loose, so I lower my audio. In the normal overworld however, you can pick up footsteps and quiet enemy conversations, really funny ones.
---
Thats what he is saying. If you are going to go grab a smoke after dropping your meat, get in the drums first then take off. It helps a little.
---
Thats silly, rats can totally open doors, pretty sure all the monsters can. Creatures open the door at my camp all the time. Doors are pretty much pointless. Apparently the only use for doors is for people to complain no one closes them.
---
At least they fixed the bug where workshop icons sometimes wouldn't show up after changing worlds.
---
Awarded for completing, Earle just has junk and a normal legendary on him.
---
They should do it with every major faction settlement
---
Alright sweet. The same goes for the cursed weps and such too, right? I’m on console so I haven’t gotten to play but I’m an outfit/unique weapon collector looking forward to our release - I’ve heard there’s sometimes issues looting his body
---
Should’ve gotten for free. I made sure I switched points around just to get and I’m glad being it cost 4500 bullion
---
You will timeout on a spit or drum
---
They made a post about 2 hours ago saying it will be live on consoles next week...
---
"They call me Tato Salad."
---
It’s all bullshit. It will take away your budget until you move your camp around. All exploits can get you banned but it’s highly unlikely considering they can’t even ban burners properly. Just make sure nobody sees them and you are good
---
I’ve had 2 different servers have 2-4 afk doing nothing for the duration. It’s just so easy to afk while being productive, like you said.
---
Also XB.
---
I absolutely love the idea, also adding a mechanic to her attacks where she is pretty much swimming in honey, making movement difficult for everyone around her would be a great thing
---
Thats actually not cool. At the fastnacht event was no way to help while afking.
---
If you join an event you should help out. Meat week is the ONLY one where its ok as long as you play drums or turn the meat
---
You can also just find a T-51 Torso to keep around and swap it out, before you go crazy and actually buy the X-01 jetpack, which is what I tried when I put Dark Matter on my Excavator. 
---
The thing is comically enormous, maybe check it out with a different torso before buying the plans.
---
Exactly. You could afk all day on the drums and spits and still be contributing instead of being idle and hiding out.
---
since my last post Ive done 2bogs, an ash heap and 2 toxic valley no problems..
---
the only one that failed was the ash heap and the timer ran out before we could kill the legendary sheepsquach..
---
seems like a case by case deal.. I havent had any problems so far
---
Try the insurgent outfit. That also go together well.
---
Not being pushed around by dress up tin cans that cannt even figure out how to tactically retreat to higher ground.  Why did the responders feel they could push around the raiders but not the BOS.....both needed the resources.  The dam was a crime of passion not of cold hearted thuggery.  The BOS would be happy to use up every tin of dog food and every scrap of lead and until every survivor was dead.  All in the name of saving humanity from its self and it technology.
---
Well....until you die of dehydration and hunger at least. Especially in front of the spit. That shit is hot!
---
It's under the yellow lamp, on lighting tab.
---
What would say to someone placing fixers and shielded vault suits for sale?
---
Each lvl costing more is so dumb
---
Your post says it was some level 200 on a building team
---
i have em in my vendor for 76 caps.. never sold one
---
Yes, you either get awarded a cursed weapon, plushy, head ornament thing, rug  plan or mask. His body can disappear but it's not the end of the world.
---
Marsupial is the one I couldn’t live without, but you must have Starched Genes first!  Class Freak is also a plus.
---
it hasn't been for a while in my experience
---
I was sort of annoyed when I saw two people camped out on the pits today for over an hour, but since they contribute I guess it doesn't bother me anymore. Not gonna lie though, I might be dropping a nuke on them if I could.
---
I tried this in my private server and the controller turns off.
---
How do I prevent this?
---
I had no idea aqua boy was a NW perk! Where do you to to hide the longest? Or do you just travel by water the entire time?
---
3 less people to kill Bush Wookie/Scuba Steve
---
Better if you kill their brahman and leave that meat by the vendor!
---
If that's true then it is very likely you can nuke ANYWHERE after the first one to trigger. Even your camp! Joking. Hope your right, I love 2fers.
---
Just... look at the effects?
---
I was able to see the offer yesterday. Not sure if it’s still there today
---
That sounds like a lot of effort that quite frankly I'm not willing to give.  Its not important enough to me.
---
Actually I think if enough people do the drums and pits it can stall the meter, preventing it from dropping at all. At least that’s what I remember from last years meat week. 
---
I’m not 100% sure tho.
---
Credit where it’s due, the Brotherhood refused to use the nukes. If they had used the nukes then maybe it wouldn’t be as bad. Or if the Brotherhood was such a big problem, why didn’t the Enclave wipe them out? You were superior in every way except numbers after all...
---
It’s working?!
---
Since the stealth suit works by creating a stealth field along its surface, it wouldn’t do much for you if you were wearing clothing on top of it. 
---
Think of the classic Invisible Man. By wearing a trance coat, hat, sunglasses and bandages, you could see him. Same concept here, essentially.
---
This is my experience as well with my handmade and fixer.
---
Fair enough.  I just love the idea of seeing damage figures of 7000+ for a minigun.  I don't do it, just have seen videos and such.
---
Yep, then I told his dad what he did, his dad is a gamer and they live down the street from my house. He was pissed at his son and now the son is still grounded. Don't fuck with another man's game.
---
It doesn’t sell from them anymore. It drops from events. 
---
I think I have a link to a resource that can help. Be right back.
---
[Here it is. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview)

Savage Divide events, it looks like.

The new miners mask has a built in helmet and the light works.

If that’s the case after x period of time, depositing junk ahead of time would solve that issue if someone’s worried about losing junk after the event.
---
Would love more headlight options. I use head pieces I dont like, just because it replaces the pip light
---
Stealth is broke as fuck
---
Its not like the game tells you or anything.  The only direction is "help Graham"
---
Ghoulish 3 perk ya noob.
---
Just tp to your camp
---
I solve this problem by just having my camp sit in a field.

I can’t help but nitpick natural history elements in film and games; a decade of work in life sciences and ecology and equal amount of time researching the interactions of the biotic and abiotic factors in wetlands and disturbed systems - including training and work in watershed monitoring and assessment - has lead to me really appreciating when fiction gets things less wrong or accidentally right. Can’t yell and scream about how bad things are in fiction - most is horribly wrong, but it’s a fantasy so you’ve gotta roll with it. But you can nitpick when things are attempted to be done right or, as in the case with Fallout, be pleasantly surprised to the point of headcanoning the disparate elements when things are accidentally done right! Lack of snow, persistent mine fires, and relative drought through the FO76 map fall into that category. Unrealistic elements like Ultracite and flora flux can be handwaved for the sake of story and fictitious world when kept consistent... and that has interesting repercussions. Like an enormous amount of highly radioactive liquid that seems to be draining from an upland region into two aquifers. If plugged into real world conditions, the fissures present some potentials for game or story expansion I’m not sure the devs or content creators know or care about enough to utilize. Believe it or not, it sets the stage for kind of plugging a bit of a real-world disconnect with Fallout 3.

Nuking places to hells low or high poses extreme problems in the short term and low level but very persistent issues in the long term, but life bounces back astoundingly well. Overarching climatic shifts pose far more of a problem in the aftermath of widespread destruction than the initial blows. Even relatively small wildfires can shift a hot summer into autumn-like conditions across a decently large area. The lower-yield, dirtier bombs of the Fallout universe compared to our own are potentially more devastating in the long run than the massive thermonuclear devices we were testing towards the end of the arms race, if deployed in high quantities. Way more fallout, to begin with. This has implications for radioactive ash on and in the soil, affecting people, but also impacts how the world climates will shift. After two decades, most atmospheric dust will have settled and - depending on region - much of the destroyed areas will experience regrowth of plants, even after sun starvation of a prolonged nuclear winter. With larger nukes, the after-effects of a nuclear winter would be very different than with the smaller ones in The FO universe. Ash has real consequences in terms of global temperatures and weather patterns, as it affects albedo. A high-yield nuclear war could lead to a new ice age, but in FO it is unlikely that any ice caps remain. Fires followed by an ashen nuclear winter leading to drought exacerbated by global shifts following ice cap melting would leave most of the east coast of America a dust bowl. Appalachia would be spared much of this, but would certainly see lower precipitation.

Enter Ultracite.

Given the underground nuking in the Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog areas and the phosphate fans in the Toxic Valley, the Ohio River basin - if not much of the Mississippi - is in serious trouble. If the raiders blew Grafton Dam instead of Summerville, it would have likely done far more long-term damage. IRL West Virginia is drained by two watersheds: the Ohio River Basin, which stretches all the way to Jamestown, New York, and the Potomac River Basin. The game map seems to alter this a little, seemingly putting Watoga and the Cranberry Glades farther east, out of the New River drainage, implying a different watershed leading into Virginia. Either way, subsurface irradiation through conversion of mineral veins to Ultracite while cracking bedrock, coupled with the upland radioactive waste disposal site leads to radioactive seepage. The lower Ohio River Basin would turn into a dead zone and (per FO universe consistency) mutant factory. The eastern side of the Appalachian mountains, meanwhile, will get a much longer term and much more intense, slow release of potently radioactive subsurface water and seeping radioactive waste. Normally the heavier elements will drop out and become part of the hydric soils in bogs, seeps, and ponds along the way. Add in the persistent drought conditions, and they won’t really move far at all past the localized wetland features, but that means the bulk of the water leading to the Potomac will be far more radioactive than fallout from the bombs would account for, for a much longer time. I mentioned that the glowing sea in FO4 makes some sense because of the power plant and weapons storage there; the Capital Wasteland’s lack of leafy greenery and increase in persistent green of everything else makes more sense with the alteration of the map of WV and the introduction of Ultracite as something being created, exploited, and disposed of in Appalachia.
---
So... Content Creator team and Devs (once done with bug fixes)... can we get some crazy monster catfish invading up the Potomac? Now that’s an enemy I can head canon justification for healing factor and bullet sponginess ;)
---
It's far more fun when it just happens and you like....oh....that's a thing that happened.
---
Its looses its charm when it's the only thing that happens.  And will make it all the more shocking if they fix it.  I try not to build around a bug in games like this.
---
I was assuming both would be visible, like the effects in smaller font below the custom name, but hey -- lack of communication on my part.
---
Uranium fever 0.25% to drop from event
---
That’s your opinion, thanks for it.
---
I agree.  It may be fun to kill the sbq in 3 shots from a minigun the first few times, but eventually...  what I really want is just new content.
---
 Today I joined the game and the same thing happened. Mysteriously they are all complete. This is not a bug, it is a pretext to buy Atoms to progress in the battle pass :)
---
I’m not quite sure. Todd says it just works.
---
lol I got the plans for the stealth suit and never made it.  Full health Junkies PA baby!   I kick in the door and yell "Daddy's home!" BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT  (my .50 cal)
---
There is time to jump in PA if you whip it straight out, or before you actually leave, or nuke with the very edge and then you run out without being radded to death...
---
I was overencumbered :(
---
Thanks! Got it!
---
You shouldn’t have to have a lvl 3 perk card just to exit an event without dying ya noob.
---
When I actually had luck with pets, before Wastelanders, I’d find them at the scene locations.
---
You can respec your character, it just takes time.
---
Enclave were Sitting in there bunkers making scorchbeasts
---
Do you get the event completion? Because part of the event is to escape the cave....
---
Get your tongue out of Bethesda’s arsehole. You’re honestly pathetic. If he wants to risk getting punished, that’s on him. You have no right to do anything to his camp.
---
Disgruntled pie thieves man. All because the Purveyor steals from you doesn't mean you steal from others!
---
That's unfortunate
---
That all depends - how hot is this 'honeybeast queen'?
---
Plus there’s a whole program for Testing Games on Xbox One named Xbox Insider r/xboxinsiders they can add PTS their like PUBG PTS &amp; Minecraft idk why they don’t want to do it , hopefully u/ladydevann &amp; u/valseek can respond
---
I didn’t think Ghoulish stopped you taking Rad damage?
---
Equip CSA before stepping out of the mine. Easy.
---
You haven’t been able to sell it for like a year.
---
Data miners dont have it on the rewards list but its really cheap from Graham and you can eat it after the event as a consumable, so worth purchasing imo
---
Yes, you do.  You don't even need to escape the cave.  If you're in the cave at the end of the timer, it just puts you at the external entrance.
---
Increase overseer rank in NW is harder i'd say. Unless you're creating new characters for that one too
---
I don’t think the Enclave made the Scorched. They set up the Liberator factory in Appalachia to trick the DEFCON system into thinking there was an active invasion on US soil, therefore permanently setting it to DEFCON 1 though.
---
I thought it killed you but I’m on console so I wouldn’t actually know😂 good to know though👍🏽
---
Sell it cooked
---
I think your thinking of Nuclear Winter
---
Really?! When did that change?
---
I fucking love this
---
*in sarcastic nerdy voice*
---
But don't you know we need something more that doesn't make us work towards it
---
I am afk-ing my first round of meat week while I put my kids down to bed.
---
That’s... not meat week. That’s primal cuts. All you’re missing out on is a few scrip, that’s not game breaking. At fasnacht you literally couldn’t complete the event and get any of the rewards
---
This is a non issue and really shouldn’t be a complaint compared to the litany of other problems that require more immediate attention from the devs.
---
Yeah it was a tight squeeze to get out of the mine in time so I didn’t have enough time. I also got delayed by a few secs because I was searching for my Chinese stealth suit that I hadn’t unlocked on that character yet, so I wasted time looking for what wasn’t there. 
---
And yeah, if someone else nukes the area they’re more than likely a peanut that Nukes with Monongah Mine right in the centre.
---
You mean like fighting the queen or fighting the random spawn collussus or like in radiation rumble or like in uranium fever. Don't forget about when your in Poseidon power plant. Yea we don't enter rad zones often do we.
---
I mean, it would be nice, it's just not super necessary.
---
I got that backpack too lol  
---
Atleast, i got the rarest hat from Colossal Problem
---
Finally, someone with the finally to finally!
---
Sure they did 😜
---
Cue mad world
---
Sure but standing there hoping someone else will do it for you isn’t exactly helping, if they would explore the area just a little bit I’m sure they’d notice the interact-able objects like bushfires and cooking spits. You could also look up a quick guide if you aren’t sure but failing every hour because no one tries is kinda frustrating.
---
Really? For me it’s quite the opposite, I’m also on Xbox and higher level players give me stimpacks and ammo all the time
---
Yeah, just stay inside and loot everything you can, get teleported to the entrance for a split second and then teleport home.
---
You need to clean the rotting leftovers before turning in anything. They negatively impact the bar per second (I think, data miners list of rewards has exact numbers at bottom) and challey's poop does the same thing
---
I do this, but using the rug glitch with the power connectors, all connected to a single switch. Works like a charm.
---
Very, very unfortunate.
---
He literally talked about helmets and specifically a miners one, so relevant....
---
Just another post wanting respect to be a thing which means another shot for me to drink
---
And it's an easy fix too, just let backpacks stay equipped in PA. No need for extra model or whatever.
---
You must have had some pretty awful luck. By most accords, high level players in my experience tend to be awful nice to lowbies. I'm new to the game, and I keep getting showered with plans and ammo by random passerby high level players. I'm sorry to say that I think you've been running into the fairly low amount unfriendly players. Saying that, I dont know if the Xbox community is as im PC
---
I did just encounter a problem, meat week didn’t start
---
Don’t listen to these people in the comments telling you how to prevent it, because there’s isn’t a way. It’s random. I sometimes am logged out during reset, sometimes logged in, sometimes even on the challenges screen, and have never had it happen. If you listen and do stupid stuff you’ll just be wasting your time for no reason and disappointed when it still happens
---
It don't. It heals you stupidly fast. You should just fast travel out to literally any where on the map.
---
God damn Beckett acts like he owns the place.  He hasn’t closed a door once since he moved in.
---
That's why you have the option of it doing all that or not.
---
by the same logic all of the survivors have spent 25 years in a vault being indoctrinated and learning to work together
---
So yeah if you both leave PVP on you get the blind date mechanic.
---
If you both turn PVP off you get a cooperative game.
---
If you turn PVP off and someone else contests your possession of a workshop you get the tinder type behavior where you can decide whether or not you get to run before you get sucker punched.
---
Everybody gets the game they want just not with necessarily every possible other player.
---
and if I had the choice really there would be non-PVP and PVP servers like other games do.
---
If I were given God like powers to rearrange the game I know a lot of simple changes I would make that would require minimal touching of the code.
---
I usually do, much to my dislike, but this particular character I hadn’t unlocked it yet so I 
---
a) wasted time looking for it in my inventory
---
b) had to settle for my Excavator PA and the animation was too long (bloodied build)
---
I never kill anyone unless they’re wanted. Then your level doesn’t matter.
---
Never seen or been harassed by anybody in hundreds of hours.
---
Well we have a whackadoodle leader who is letting every Tom Dick and Harry come into the parlor for refreshments and snack cakes.  And some ass hat packed our orbital satellite with TV dinners and expired currency. We have plenty of issues.....but we also don't pretend to be heros.
---
What do you mean ‘harassed’?  How are they harassing you?
---
I usually see the opposite, with higher level players dropping stuff for new players.
---
You do queens inside the nuke zone?😂😂 yeah we’re scrubs aren’t we.
---
&gt; Because part of the event is to escape the cave....
---
lol, I've never successfully escaped the mine. Can't find the exit half the time, and the rest of the time I die and it auto-ejects me anyway.  
---
Still get the event completion rewards though.
---
Really? I got a Bloodied more power and sold it for 1,500.
---
What are they doing to harass you?
---
Sweet, great to know👍🏽
---
To make sure you saw the answer down a bit- you have to finish the full questline (excluding dailies and rep) to start getting them
---
But at the end you get 500 atoms and the game bord for your base, etc
---
The last step says escape the cave though right? That’s what I meant👍🏽 &amp; yeah I heard the exit signs were a big complaint on the PTS. Good to know i dont have to exit though i want those screws😂
---
It's not about greed, it's about will. If they don't want to make it, they won't and we can't do much about it. But if they want to make money, they could add this as a Fallout 1st reward. They'd get trashed on for it but people would still pay for the subscription.
---
I dont know why people dont do something, sorry you had to deal with that. Rn I just got back to check on my characters and im in a server with every afkable object in use lol. The events must be completing super fast.
---
Mean how?
---
That’s 40 scrip right there.
---
you say bug, i say feature.
---
People don't need to nuke dead center on the mine.  Just nuke south to barely catch the mine but also get mononga and the mansion, wind up with a ton of stabilizers and flux.
---
If you do it right you only need to run a short distance when you exit the mine to get out of the rads .
---
When you fast travel there for the event,it drops you by glassed caverns and your ass the has to hoof it to the bunker to fight there noob. Play it more and you would see.
---
The rad damage is what killed me, as I was a bloodied build I didn’t have much health to begin with and the animation getting into PA took too long. 
---
So yeah Ghoulish wouldn’t work for me. 
---
And I was overencumbered so I couldn’t fast travel.
---
If I have to choose between the Brooltherhood and Graham and Chally, I choose Grahm and Chally.
---
Quest items dont get affected by perk cards. This includes super duper and the two you mentioned (and to clarify I mean items listed under crafting as quest item or that have a diamond beside when in an inventory)
---
I have to disagree - The Enclave only allowed capable Vault Dwellers into the parlour, and then used them to regain their foothold in Appalachia.
---
If you’re looking for a good spot to sever hop go to the Cranberry Glade. The random spawn point is right and in the parking lot. Super easy just need luck.
---
The only situation I’ve ever had another player try to harass me is pvp’ers wanting to force a fight for workshops. Sorry to hear you’ve had such hard luck with stronger players :(
---
That doesn’t mean that it’s worth that, that means that your ignorance gave that guy a deal of a lifetime
---
My last Prime cuts I was knee deep in radscorpion eggs.
---
You know...this basic model could work for a lot of things.  Mirelurk Queens are already a thing...maybe a Mirelurk Empress?  Someone earlier mentioned an Ant Queen event.  
---
Essentially it could work for nearly anything...a Mole Monarch, GigaSloth, etc.
---
For the most part I've been doing a lot of events. I might try to build a new camp that could be something fun
---
It seems like it goes off of lowest players level. I'm 300+ and if I solo it ive been getting level 75 and 100 enemies but if a level 30 (give or take) is there they spawn at 20 - 35
---
I disagree non of my toons are capable vault dwellers.
---
I had that happen once but today I was just gankt by 3 players leveled at around 300,200,100. I was just minding my own business with my friend and they claimed both our workshops and killed us over and over again... I know it’s not like against the rules to do what they did but it was still annoying... they invites us to a party and basically told us we chose to go into pvp when you claim a workshop he said workshops are only for raiders so it was my fault I died. I got mad and swore at him and now he said he’s going to report me for swearing so I’m just really stressed... it’s just frustrating to be level 15 and get attacked by a group of level 100+ people.
---
Ok so the more I read your comments, the more I learn you’re a bit of a spastic. 
---
If the people in the server are as idiotic as you, then yes you probably do get dumped in around Glassed Caverns, but fast traveling to V9 like 99.9% of the player base is a much better idea, unless someone with the intelligence of a pineapple nukes V9 as well.
---
Right ive found a couple of legendaries in my last one
---
Here is the map with random encounters and tameable pet spawns:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C68OO5Kygp8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C68OO5Kygp8)
---
This is all you need to know about taming:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pHUDVD-MSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pHUDVD-MSM)
---
But can be obtained for free so that's not really an issue?
---
Actually no, because fire rate is under 200
---
Lol legendaries just lying on the ground what is this Fasnacht?
---
This is how it should be.
---
Think about it this way - they think the more work people have to do, the more time they have to spend on 76. If it’s time gated they can force them to spread their time over days. Every time they log in, they immediately get directed to the Atom Shop, and the more time they spend there the more likely they are to spend atoms.
---
That’s their line of logic. Not mine.
---
Agreed but the game should tell you instead of leaving you to figure it out
---
I guess there will always a few bad apples, maybe just change the server?
---
I don't get why the tents are there.  You get a free fast travel to the tent anyway which is less likely to glitch on you.  I have had events not trigger by just walking into them, requiring a fast travel directly to the event hexagon.  
---
Though while we are complaining about Primal Cuts.  Can I just say the number of mole rats is too damned high!  A stealther can't catch a break.  I can't compete with psychic subterranean rodents with tremorsense that tells everything else where I am.
---
They must be at least half competent if they can even access the bunker in the first place.
---
As usual, there are triple-digit Veterans just AFKing in chairs or standing around.
---
Grafton lake
---
Interesting thanks, I'll check it out.
---
My fault, I didn't realize that
---
Oh, they did. Perhaps not intentionally cause they were working on the mutagen serums, but they made the original Scorchbeasts. I can't remember exactly how the holotape went, but when Eckhart found out about them, he just made sure to keep them off base and not let the rest of the Enclave know about it.
---
I REALLY wish that was my experience.
---
If it wasn't for the insult bot my.first toon would have never got by that deathclaw.
---
One unforeseen advantage of building an over-budget camp is that such an exploit by that one guy is not possible(same guy one-shotting legendaries in events, 30 second killing the queen, starting encryptid early, duping, destroying camps with explosive bait - I would name him but you know, witch-hunting).
---
It can stall the meter if enough people do it, so ots much more helpful than afk people at fasnacht.
---
Also vault 76 and surrounding area is a no nuke zone, so you cant nuke this event
---
Things are starting to make me wonder how much of the 2020 roadmap isn’t gonna be released until 2021
---
Yes it should.  I like the head lamps over the pip boy glow
---
Well, it is what it is, so I suppose you'll just have to find a way to adapt.
---
Avoid workshops if you dont want to pvp. Im level 170 and dont do pvp or workshops. I promise they would have done the same if you were my level.
---
Np, I want as many successful runs as possible! :)
---
Can you remember where to find this tape?
---
11/10
---
Yeah we did that
---
This is like when I was a kid and I thought I would have to watch out for lava and quicksand when I got older....
---
So that's what you call farting in bed...
---
Honey, that wasn't a fart...I'm just trying out my jetpack...
---
Yea I have to deal with the same shit. The secret service armor buys some time &amp; eating rad away like a Fat boy eats cake is my usual solution. Jumping in a stealth suite is the fastest answer I would say.
---
Welcome to being late to the party.
---
I suggest the current behavior is a bug other people say it's the only way they get to grief people and they don't want to lose it.
---
And none of us get to control what Bethesda does anyway.
---
It's not like I expected everybody to riot or something...
---
Not an unusual sight... I’ll give you that. 
---
I’m starting to think that maybe some of those players just have the game open in the background while either working or doing other things.
---
How else should we get resources??
---
The problem here isn't the rad zone, that only makes sense since the mine is nuked. It's the stupid system of dropping your junk on death.
---
The red dots ( scene)
---
Shhh
---
Exactly. You used a distraction, which indicates ingenuity, then you had to figure out the code to get hold of the man’s key.
---
See with the community coming up with great idea's like this, im surprised Beth hasn't "borrowed" them.
---
For PS4 users: I got it working by doing the following:
---
1) instert blood sample;
---
2) read all the other info on the terminal;
---
3) analyze blood sample;
---
4) put the T-fuse in place. 
---
Took me a whole day but eventually I completed the quest. GL!
---
That is exactly what I’m doing. GT Omnytrix, please don’t kill me.
---
Ngl I don't really see the connection with what we were talking about.
---
 I refuse to waste caps on fast travel. We're not all under lvl 100 like you.
---
They’ll probably become more valuable over the year
---
Youre joking right? My scrap box is full of resources without going into work shops, and that has little to do with level. 
---
Steel/plastic: hit the mutants for their weapons
---
Acid/fiber/adhesive: anally gaster and fog crawlers
---
Lead/gold/copper: hit the mines, this gets easier with the excavator PA at lvl 25.
---
Greed. What do you do to acquire atoms? Grind your ass off or buy them with real money.
---
Going to upvote this soley because it's good advice. This would probably be a high rated comment and not in the negatives if you'd have just been nice about how you said it.
---
You'll get way more just through looting and scrapping locations you come across. Workshops haven't been worth the effort since like a month after launch, when they got nerfed hard.
---
I literally have my camps within 3 cap fast travel of Foundation for this exact reason and I cannot remember the last time I went to Crater, lol
---
Oh that seems entirely possible.  They're probably just searching for the nuke event, and then confirming the radiated area on the mine area to spawn the event.  They aren't checking to see whether the nuke that was dropped actually hit the mine.  An existing radiated area would spawn more events once more nukes were dropped, regardless of **where** they were dropped.
---
This is gonna require further testing.
---
I’ve had it tell me that shit, I chose to stay and 5-6 min after I start waking around, my camp appeared on the map....wtf
---
I was saving up for bloody mess but this may have just convinced me, thanks for the tip!
---
Your friend gifts you the game then lies about going to your camp to show some weapon....then he drops an ammo factory....some "friend"
---
Let’s go PVP right now!! I don’t take kindly to nuke threats from 13 year olds. haha Joking. 2fers ftw. Let me know if this works for you.
---
Possible to implement for other companies. We‘re talking about Bethesda here
---
Wear the stealth suit under your PA, anytime you get out you'll have 1000 rad protection and that stealth option. Thats what i do
---
More people need to see this and understand how to not be a cunt
---
Level up 3 times is already a weekly challenge. Do some research before you make a post about something you don’t understand
---
I’m not joking I’m just genuinely new to the game and didn’t know..
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try.
---
That's an really touching example of random wholesomness. Whoever you are, owner of this camp, thank you.
---
I remember when passive mode wasn’t a thing. You could just smash the door down
---
There's not enough people on on my server to justify afking during the night wish there was.
---
shits so dumb, you shouldn’t be able to place tents in combat imo
---
Or take out doors in general 🤷‍♂️
---
True, if they had any other game engine the game wouldn't have half the problems it does
---
You have to go save him from the raiders.
---
I completely agree with you, which makes me confused by wearing a backpack or seperate head piece
---
The workshops are mainly for pvp, not materials. All materials you need you can get without them. If you go the pvp route eventually, good luck andyoull find you arent taking workshops for the little scraps of material they generate. 
---
I can run cranberry bog for half an hour and get more acid fiber optic and ballistic fiber than anything the workshops could wish to produce in an entire day of holding them. Honestly, without 1st, you wont be able to hold onto much of it anyway.
---
Main menu, photo gallery option.
---
Delete the ones you dont want.
---
I hated that my load screens were black bear lodge, crop fields, etc.
---
my experience has generally been good.. havent seen one base on a spawn point for p-cuts yet and the only cookout Ive failed so far only 1 other person besides myself showed up
---
Really wish they would allow the modders that fixed their previous games, fixing Fo76 for them.
---
Okay now I know what you mean. Imma go to sleep because I have to read 10 times the same line to understand. Have a good day/night.
---
(Btw nice username)
---
Yeah, it’s 0029 for me XD
---
Lmao 🤣 finally someone with the guts to tell it the way it is! 
---
I have been having the same issue aswell, since launch! Lol. It is an absolute joy to say the least, and people wonder why I'm always bitching about things in game, it the smallest things that get under my skin, and I wouldn't probably care so much, if there was a consistency with the bugs 🐛 being fixed in this game. But it seems like two steps 🚶‍♂️ forward 10 steps back 😕 every time they say something has been fixed, and this definitely one of the most popular 🤔 ones. 
---
On a  better note I promise to never reference finally someone with the guts to ...... anymore because personally I think it is so over referenced at this point, and in addition to that some new dialog would be great. 
---
I do wish you, and everyone all the best 👍
---
I think we’re fighting some different queens brother I’ve never once been put at the glass cavern when going to the event😂
---
I'm sure lots of people are still trying to figure out exactly what to do. This is my first meat week and it took me a few to get the hang of it. It hasn't been a full day, give people time.
---
As for the rest, iagree.
---
Hey mods are on there way, on one platform you have the option to (enable mods) though it doesn't seem to do anything, might be a little teaser...
---
It’s a janky explanation. Maybe a certain amount of the surface area of the CSS needs to be open to create the field effect.
---
I've got a set of the basic masks and an old man winter mask just sat in my stash and I dunno what to do with them
---
Why is this called Meat Week = Failure when it's just 90% complaining about people 1 shotting a legendary which has absolutely nothing to do with a successful Meat Week event?
---
I've done a bunch of meat week and not a single one has failed. I also never had a single Fasnacht fail either.
---
It's close enough. Besides, you can increase the firerate with mods.
---
Edit: No mods, but magic triggers ~200.
---
Just one more hour here
---
Its spelt Fatsnatch.
---
Haven’t had luck in weeks in the Cranberry Glade (literally hours of server hopping). 
---
But that’s where I found my Mirelurk Hunter.
---
noobs will learn by the end of it..
---
If there arent people getting ready for the cookout 5 mins early.. I legit consider server hopping...
---
Nice, I truly appreciate it when I see people in game (and even more in real life) trying to help out others, no questions asked.  Some of the reactions when someone asks for some materials, like just enough to craft something and I give them a whole lot.  A lot of folks just leave stuff lying on the ground when I say no charge today.
---
I mean since I’m new to the game I didn’t know how else to get a decent amount of items and so when I learned about the workshops I thought that would be good to use. Basically my friend and I used two workbenches not knowing they were used for pvp and a group of high levels took his workshop and kept killing him and then they went to my workshop since I was in a team with him and took mine.. I’m not mad they took it I’m just mad about how they went about it he got into a call with us and yelled at us for not knowing it was for pvp. He was calling us names and such. It was just not a fun experience because I’m new and didn’t know....
---
I had to look it up, its in the genetics lab on one of the terminals. [Here is a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7w334/massive_spoiler_real_source_of_the_scorched_beast/) from last year talking about it.
---
Ironically I’ve failed 6 Prime Cuts events because dwellers won’t waste their precious ammo on the objectives or do minimum damage just to tag a mob... 308 lvl in stealth up at his tent unable to kill a Radscorpion? C’mon &gt;:c
---
been thinking about hopping back on for this event. are the awards worth it?
---
"22 a day" is a reference to Veteran suicide in the United States, although I'm sure that's extended to Veterans of other nations. 
---
Camps like these really hit home, it's very nice to see!
---
I’ll have to listen to that one again...
---
It's ok as long as NW wasn't the last mode you played before server reset
---
I end up at the dam fissure or at the caverns. Not only at the caverns but down in the dam hole so the best option is to fast travel again to the d9 bunker.
---
Do the red fireworks still work? Had a bunch I kept in my stash from last years event
---
I got attacked last night twice at the Hemlock Holes workshop by different high level players. Both happened when I was defending the workshop against a wave of mirelurk attacks. The first time I was hit from the back and killed pretty quickly by just one player. The second time this group of two or three players showed up and were helping me defend the workshop against another (Event) mirelurk attack. I have done the same for other players myself.  Yet something clicked in me head and I sprinted to my stash box and began stowing the most valued junk items when suddenly one of the players in this group took me out. This group did not take my drop loot bag, but the first player did. I should have learned my lesson when I lost all my junk loot in the Lode Bearing quest, etc.  Meaning if you do not want to lose your hard earned junk, then protect it.  Both attacks were by surprise. Also, they we more than twice my level and they had superior weapons. I do not mind the PVP aspect but should it not be a more level playing field? You get a warning when you claim a workshop that a PVP may happen, but I thought I would get some kind of notice of a challenge. Perhaps I missed something? It probably would not have mattered much though as one player was at level 200 and probably using a PVP Bloodied build.  I now strive to keep as much of my junk in my stash box as I can.  Oh, I have never been attacked before and I have been playing about 10 weeks or so.  It can happen to anyone at any workshop me thinks. Take care.
---
Not at all. Easy peasy.
---
Adrenal reaction. And yes you can stack adrenal reaction and nerd rage and a bloodied weapon
---
Hadn’t seen that specific video yet but it’s got some good info ✌️
---
That’s... not meat week related, but that may be the mole rats that constantly show up to distract you from the prime creatures, which is how the creatures know how to reach you.
---
You’re probably thinking of adrenal reaction. It works alongside bloodied so they stack
---
Also wanna know this
---
I always travel to drop site v9 maybe that’s why I never had it happen, I never go to the event directly
---
Wait so meat week is live? I thought it was next month?
---
They also spawn underground sometimes, rendering the event uncompletable.
---
Because the brotherhood is settling at atlas observatory what if we had to use the weather machine to freeze them out
---
Actually - that's a solid plan.
---
Yeah they do. Ive seen plenty of threads of people complaining about it. The ones you still see just havent been caught and reported yet as it requires a player report to catch them. Bethesda cant find them on their own. Its kind of pathetic.
---
Yeah I had to move Beckett to the other side of my camp, because fucker kept opening my secret nuka cola door.
---
That’s great. As it should be!
---
How do you prepare? Missed it last year.
---
Just need a script machine now. Couple more months from now and we should have it.
---
Well done. For Chally!
---
I just leave my xbox on over night and let my guy craft throwing knifes. I don’t use super duper so i can craft the max amount till i hit weight limit. I’m using a full uny/wwr armor set for this. Each knife gives 2exp. You can  scrap all knifes at once. Make sure to equip Scraper perk and use a Guns and Bullets 5 magazine so you won’t loose any steel. I get 100 score points in 26 minutes this way.
---
That's one. So basically if it did 50 damage those would make what 150?  I apologize in advance, I suck at math
---
I try to keep my survival tent there later in the evening to avoid the headache. This game hates me.
---
Now people get a free fast travel to my camp!
---
Not everyone wants everything that's offered for the week, I'll maybe take one or two things that interest me, or a bundle. Bundles usually stick around for 2-3 weeks. Typically costing something like 1000-1600 atoms. If you did all your daily and weekly challenges, you could make about 570 atoms a week. Meaning if you really managed your time you could even get a 1600 atom bundle on the last day of the third week if you grinded.
---
Many, many personalities in the 76 community have gone on record saying they used to only buy ATX content with free challenge atoms and never spent a dime. It's why there's so much of an uproar in threads like these, people don't want to have to pay.  
---
Keep in mind that is further supplemented by the lifetime challenges as well.
---
Man I miss having 1st😂 that damn tent is the single most useful item in the entire game in my opinion
---
Umm... so where is your "suugestion" to Bethesda about fixing these issues? No where, right? You just went straight to the players.
---
Next time, rather than turn to the players for a problem they didn't cause nor is it really there place to fix but you address the issue with both the ones that caused the issue and the only ones who can properly fix it - Bethesda.
---
Just a suggestion.
---
That's why I stuck space race in her own little bunker
---
Aside from afking the actual event placing your camp near the prime events to me doesn't make any difference. Yeah they're getting the meat and notes but there's a time gate on the notes and the meat spoils so I don't care that people are doing this. One shotting the legendaries in general is a dick move but almost every legendary in the prime cut events are only one star so again doesn't make much difference to me I don't need any one star legendaries especially if it's armor 3 scrip isn't even worth the stash space.
---
how the hell does that make sense, put it into realistic terms, if one person learns the plans to something, how in the actual fuck will a completely different person know it
---
When wooks emote to me I usually just let them win if we're the final two.
---
Did it work? I use T-51
---
So the goal of the prime events is to kill everything to get the meat at the end. Doesnt matter who's doing it, all are rewarded.  The real issue is no one doing anything at the cook out. If you wanna kill legendaries, go farm them outside of the event.
---
I am on PS4.  I gave up on colossal problem a long time ago.  If  someone nukes the mine and I get an event notice  saying that Colossal Problem is starting, that is when I will think about it.  Until then I just operate on the assumption that it's never coming out.  That's my mindset for all announced content from here on out.
---
The only thing I care about is having shared plans across all characters. Or a different respect system.
---
Awesome thanks
---
My gawd mention free fast travel for all and watch the fists fly ...grow up ppl if its free for one should be free for all no matter what rep. You have!
---
yea like bethesda only listens to me. you obviously have some issues take them out on someone else im done with this weird conversation
---
If you're on ps4, ill trade you that old man winter for some 556 ammo
---
I to have suffered this annoying shyte. Happens to me often in NW, less often in adventure.
---
Yeah it does all I’m asking for a share box for all characters or at least allow me to transfer wastelander gun between characters
---
Has been like that for a long long time. I send in feedback about it.
---
Yeah that's what I ended up doing but just found it odd
---
Where is grahm?
---
Same happened to me. I was waiting for the Meat Week event and stayed online as quests reset. I usually log off just to be safe.
---
a good way to prepare is pre-making chally's feed, showing up on time or even a bit early, and if you plan on idling idle on the drums or the meat cookers
---
Although it would be cool, a quick search said that honey bees will instead prioritize on keeping the queen alive by keeping her warm and staying in the hive.
---
Dropping it by any static creature spawn to farm them is broken LOL and the never ending junk space.
---
Sometimes the primal cuts enemies spawn underground, which makes it uncompletable!
---
great now you and your complainer gang are gonna downvote the hell out of me
---
Honestly, I didn’t expect this to work but IT DID! Thanks!!
---
Yep! Very cool!
---
Even if it's the tents I would more argue that either the waves one too many or the timer is just stupidly small for the event
---
I didn’t go because I had no meat!  How can I cook if I have no meat!  (Apologies to Pink Floyd)
---
That would make sense
---
Maybe people getting overencumbered with all that meat / 1\* legendaries from the meat week events and needing to drop loot? I've been dropping a few 1\* legendaries at player camps since the event started :)
---
Not as certain as op, but seems a likely culprit for spawn shenanigans in this returning event.
---
Doors are 1 flamingo each. I don’t believe in doors.
---
He keeps going on about how all these new people make him nervous, all the while HE is the new guy and we've been here a year? ;)
---
You only need to kill the ones that are marked to progress to next level.
---
Interesting. Might have to give this a shot.
---
Nah xbox. And what do we look like baggage handlers? No. Fuck no lol.
---
Magic weapons are *that* good? You sure they weren’t just hacked? I have a magic shotgun that one-shots most enemies but def not earl or even scorchbeast
---
How get both
---
Then have fun with the pettiness I guess..
---
... and turning off all your lights.
---
&gt;I dont even care anymore if its delayed on consoles again i totally lost my interest in the event
---
You aren't the only one.  This is a side effect of Bethesda hyping stuff up too far in advance and continually failing to deliver on time.
---
After a while it just gets exhausting and you don't care anymore.
---
All locations do this. It's a broken game through and through.
---
Good advice for those not taking heed for what can happen. Not my cup of tea to attack players much lower than me for the purpose of taking their loot though. Oh well, that is why Baskin-Robbins has 32 flavors.  Not everyone likes vanilla. Thanks.
---
Unlooted meat piles despawn, they leave lovely little piles of graphically represented objects. I think it's a bug, but I love it.
---
Wiped out the waves solo. Killed queen with 2 minutes left...still failed
---
Usually I can run riding shotgun without getting detected, i ran it inbetween prime cuts and was just always in danger, I have a 18 agility, all sneak perks, as well as the chinese stealth suit. Not sure what happened but it's worse today
---
Deep pocketed/pocketed and +STR armor dont work in PA. This isn't FO4 with PA super carry weight.
---
No tents
---
Travel fast bug!
---
A dirty version comes from the event.
---
Hell yeah that Starched Genes is what you're looking for
---
I just want to hang out with it
---
oh wow never thought of this thank you
---
I didn’t know we couldn’t(mainly an ESO player) and made levelled sets of everything for my second char to take out of my stash. The disappointment...
---
At 1st I was putting the Vault Celebration poster where me player faced when he laid down in bed. But it didn't have the right feel. Eventually I put the words "It will be ok". Lest till I needed the limited camp budget...
---
I have 1 character under level 100 (he’s lvl 50) and I started him last weekend. Even on him I don’t have any issue with fast traveling for caps. It’s really not that huge of an issue.
---
It’s unbearably long.
---
Was someone on the drum the whole time? Our first event failed because someone wasn't on the drum bringing the creatures in. Every time since then someone has been on the drum and continually playing and we haven't failed.
---
I don’t get it either. Kill the prime beasties!  Easy as they come. Stand there and wait for them to come to you. But the events still failed because people where running off in all directions, or the beastie spawned in somebodies locked shed or garage and no one can get to it. 
---
I didn’t say Faustnach was a failure. Other than some dicks who threw out explosive bait at the end so all the robots got killed.
---
Likely, for a week
---
Yeah, but you can’t loot Earle or the Wendigo spawns. At least you get flux and all that though
---
People of all levels do it. I was doing Uranium Fever and someone around level 75 was spraying down a legendary with his shotgun. Luckily, I got there before he did and tagged it already.
---
It’s a shame they didn’t bother with it and instead gave it to one of their subsidiaries to deal with, but of course, Zenimax Online probably didn’t want it since they are working on TESO.
---
Guys I have a ton of noob questions lol. I wasnt here last year. Where is grahm? What do I do? Is it on console yet? How do I get stuff for him? What rewards are available? Lol
---
Always do. If you can't play the game then don't play the game. Free up the server for people that can and do.
---
The clue is in the name guys.
---
Might be a new bug, it wasn't just me who reported it.
---
No clue - I've seen people saying that Earle's DR doesnt properly load in for a few seconds so high damage weapons (magic/bloodied) can get a quick one-tap in. Also heard people saying magic weapons can just do that or perhaps im confusing them with hacked ones
---
But ultimately regardless of cause, its ridiculous that if somebody one-shots the boss, nobody gets any loot despite all signing up for an instanced event.
---
Mmmmm dirty
---
Nuka-grape (unless it changed in the last year) will remove rads without losing your mutations if you don't yet have starched genes
---
Idk if this has been tested but Prime Cuts may be failing if people aren't playing the drum the entire time.
---
Our first time someone stopped playing the drum and no creature came. The last 3 times we've done Prime Cuts someone was always on the drum and it showed up every time.
---
All my ground-floor doors get level 0 locks for this reason.  Pack of dogs runs by? Door opens for them.  Rabbit? Yep. Radstag? yep. 
---
It's just safer for everyone to have a level 0 lock on there.
---
What I've taken to doing is building a main house and a guest house, so the main house has locks on it but the guest house doesn't.
---
Its Great to have someone on both positions no matter if you’re afk or not. 
---
I even think if you have enough people doing those 2 things you can prevent the meter from dropping in general. At least that’s what I remember from last years cookout. Not 100% sure tho. 
---
But NP!
---
Even though it still contributes.
---
Err...you mean the shits playing like assholes....or me?  Either way, you get an upvote!
---
Prime cuts don't add to event meter. I have no idea if the secretly influence drop rates. Chally feed does fill the event bar, and makes piles to clean up, which fills the aforementioned bar👍🏻
---
I'm going to be honest, I've never heard of this "Slug Buster", but I apparently also ticked off Ra-Ra when I was doing that quest, because she was not very happy with me when the quest concluded. 
---
The only thing that I can think of that may have upset her is when I told her that maybe she shouldn't have activated an entire room full of killer robots, because, I don't know, that may have been a bit dangerous. I even gave her food after that!
---
But NOOOOO, apparently she just has really high standards for what she considers to be "kind".
---
So, yeah, Ra-Ra's reactions to you can be kind of weird with that quest (although it probably is a glitch, based on the fact that you said you got different reactions with the same dialogue options. That quest isn't exactly the least buggy one in the game, either).
---
mind blown
---
I think the title at least not saying "Face to Faces" was a missed opportunity haha.
---
In my runs today it seems like it’s a 50/50 shot no matter where you are.
---
The problem with them fixing the fast travel bug 🐛 is it will introduce a carrot 🥕 in your ass. Just saying this has been off and on for the last 22 months. Thats right we are close to two months away from the start of year 3 and nothing is fixed? What the fuck is the problem 😐 with that.  
---
I am still driving 🚗 around Whitesprings 🙃 in a broken down golf ⛳   kart 🚗 😳  
---
God don't bother trying to fix anything because the game might just fix it self.
---
They aren’t in bags.  They’re individual items.  I just picked up a legendary leg armor.  I think u/dockuwan’s explanation is the correct one.
---
&gt; I also never had a single Fasnacht fail either.
---
I had Fasnacht fail 3 different ways.
---
* A stray molotov from a super mutant hits all 4 bots and burns them to death.
---
* Bots are all killed by the wolves and stingwings at the end, while everyone rushes the sloth and ignores the actual objective.
---
* Griefers using explosive bait on the bots, or blowing up the car on the corner right when the bots walk past it.
---
Did people also play the drums and turn the spits? You have to do all the things
---
Not our fault that they have a shitty code. This has been out for quite some time now, there was even a Score glitch related to the ammo factory out there which they patched right after it came out. If they wanted to patch this, they would’ve done it already.
---
Also backpack
---
That is a real cunt move. AFK or not.
---
The shits playing like assholes ofc! Ahaha it’s always so annoying when you me trying to do your 3 legendary daily and one guy just one shots all the legendaries that spawn
---
The main studio, Bethesda, isn’t the one working on it. They don’t care about 76. The company working on it is one of their subsidiaries. Of course they’re going to put some amount of effort in Elder Scrolls since it’s not online.
---
u/ShouldHavePulledOut- kind of nailed it already.
---
If your regular apparel items have features that improve your carry weight, they will be negated when you enter power armor. 
---
The only time that I actually gain carry weight at this point is if I'm using Excavator.
---
I suspect there is an enemy who is stuck far away and is not pathing into the area where you guys are. 
---
I found by doing a big circular circuit around the area I find the stupid last enemy and the event completes fine.
---
Very sorry but I don't get it??? Is it like a hotline you can call or something?? It so than that is a great thing to make people aware of!
---
We are not even getting the last wave a majority of the time.
---
Nuke Mines don’t work anymore anyway, so I’ll AFK just for you in my turretless camp. In bed, sleeping so you can’t push me out. And before you say IlL jUsT lUrE cReAtUrEs To YoU, good luck getting them past my creature proof stairs.
---
Just saw another post saying that sometimes when you kill something it just explodes directly into the items, reliant on bloodymess.
---
It gets dirty after I give graham my meat
---
I gotcha. Build a camp with walls the prevent the beasties from following the normal pathways so they get lost or stuck in the woods or go of to attack some frick’n blood eagles somewhere. Camps can really fuck things up.
---
And if the event fails, no one gets prime cuts or gold.
---
As if 200+ more carry weight isn't a ton.
---
💙💙
---
This is how they could fix it, always add markers to every event animal so you can see them on the map.
---
Either that or make them always charge into the event area the players are guarding.
---
Ok thanks, funny enough I actually said it was hilarious that she activated the robots because I thought that was the most "kind" response.
---
Although possible, I doubt that since it’s not an online game plus I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the game was linear because of the new style they were transferring to, moving away from the old art style.
---
Agreed, though I believe you lose points if the spits are left to sit for too long.
---
Not a bug. A new FEATURE! Just ask Bethesda.
---
If you mean properly shoot off, I’d say yes.
---
U on xbox?
---
Approximately 7 days.. not sure tho.
---
I agree, but ‘turn the pits’ sounds like one has a diarrhea problem.
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up with new mutations. they're all 250 each in my vendor
---
Also gave me a great idea for a bloater type of feral ghoul
---
I’ll be happy to answer. 
---
-Grahm is just a little south of vault 76. (Normally without the event he’s a traveling vendor)
---
-The event is once every hour
---
-you can kill critters for intestines or collect certain plants and dump them in the boxes near the shopping carts. Turn the pits or play the drums. You can also buy a recipe from grahm that makes you craft food for grahms cow when the event starts. 
---
-as for rewards you can get cool stuff like new unique outfits, Weapons and more (I suggest you search: meat week rewards in google to see them all, it will probably link you to a recent post made by someone on this sub that has datamined them all)
---
Hope this helps!!
---
Good luck!
---
According to his level he‘s probably one of those gamepassers. Those bugs and glitches make the game fun for us OG‘s again.
---
I just hate wasting 1k a day in caps on hopping around.
---
Doesn't contribute. Just keeps the event bar from deteriorating.  Contribution moves the bar forward. If everyone is working at the main parts you don't have to worry about deterioration at all. I've ran every Meat Week without playing the drums or turning the spit like a freeloader.
---
The workshops warn you about PvP before you claim one. You don’t need to take them to get resources. 
---
Check [this resource](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) to learn better places to farm for every resource.
---
Stay out of PvP areas and I guarantee you the experiences will get better. 
---
From what you said, you and your friend kept ‘Seeking Revenge’. Unless you’re prepared for a PvP battle, don’t do that.
---
I’m not in it for the legendary rolling pins and pool cues. I want the prime cuts and script and such. But sadly, I admit, if I don’t have the cuts I’m not inclined to do the cook out. Mostly because I’m pissed. Not a cool move on my part.
---
Im so sad it isn’t the mini-Chally plush I was expecting to have strapped to me....
---
I just got the plan this from my first ever cookout.
---
But I already have Crocollosus, and Crocollosus will never leave me . . well maybe for a short while when I unlock Jangles-Bag, but I'll never use this.
---
Wondering if anybody has any idea of a fair price I should put it in my vendor for? I'm not very savvy when it comes to pricing, I generally put most things at about 10% of the suggested price.
---
I'm on PS4 if that matters at all.
---
Okay thank you I guess I didn’t read that then 😂
---
Interesting. I've seen a few lose items on the ground since Wastelanders, never figured if it was a bug or a new feature :)
---
Correct but I use the excavator power armor mainly which is supposed to increase total carry weight. It was working fine a couple weeks ago but now seems to not work.
---
Aren't the private test servers open to everyone on PC now? Also, while I play FO76 on XBox, the laptop I have didn't cost thousands of dollars and would still run 76 just fine, so saying you need to spend thousands on a PC to play 76 is an enormous exaggeration.
---
He’s probably using glitches without even realising it. When he gets to the point he can trade, if he didn’t roll a good weapon himself, it’s almost guaranteed duped. If he gets his hands on a legacy it *is* guaranteed duped. If he’s got fireworks favourited and equipped he’s using an exploit right there.
---
Grahm is just pacing about. He does have plenty of informative dialogue regarding the event and it’s objectives and sells one plan to craft Chally’s feed, which can be turned in the increase meter.
---
Turning spits, playing music, killing critters and turning in their chunks, turning in prime meat, turning in greens, scooping Chally dung, extinguishing fires and cleaning up rotten food all boosts the bar. Obtain the max rank, and the event ends.
---
Except for prime meat and chally feed, Everything is there with Grahm. Rewards can be found elsewhere, and it should be on console.
---
When I made the post, that character was level 25 so naturally it had very low durability. That character is now level 40 and has a better version and now I barely have to repair it. So no mutations or anything.
---
He just learned about the 7 years war. Give him a break, things aren’t always what they say.
---
