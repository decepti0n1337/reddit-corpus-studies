I've looked at all the challenge sections and there's nothing there I've gotten the last two rewards but I don't see any challenge progress for today's challenge
---
---
---
Just wait til‚Äô you hear about this thing called the atom shop.
---
i must say you probably got too much radiation your brains if you dont see what mistake you made
---
There‚Äôs usually one in the lodge building overlooking the train station. The one that has 3 can chains hanging outside the front door. If you go in there and up the stairs there‚Äôs a luggage trolley (I think) with a case on it. A ushanka spawns on that.
---
Ah ok. I was told they were in the atom shop but gone after a week. Hopefully I can find them now. Thanks!
---
"I understood that reference."
---
Those were the days!!
---
The unyeilding armor is the god roll.  Powered and Sentinel effects are the most sought after unyeilding perks.  
---

---
If you use unyeilding,  you would be crazy to get rid of that peice.  
---
If you want to get rid of it and are on XBox, I will buy it from you.
---
I can fit it for mats if you wish
---
Thank you for being specific üëå
---
Checked the calculator vs the game on multiple occasions. Also checked the Github repo for it and it was last updated Oct 15th. So, not that outdated.
---
But in an effort to be thorough, I will double check it when I get on later.
---
Next time let me know and you can join my private world and do it there..
---
Wow dude, Absolutely beautiful!
---
That would be nice üëçüèª
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been up there, so I hope I‚Äôm remembering it correctly. Let me know if you find it as described.
---
they tried to fix it, but broke everything else when they did, so they rolled back the fix.  
---
Its still not fixed.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen mods in awhile a good 2 months or so with modus been looking for SA mods.
---
Donation box at camps would be cool but it would have to show player levels, and no way to see if just a new chat or a genuine new player good idea tho
---
I will, checking now.
---
Yup, basically FFR is going to give you +25% to your damage output. For Explosive to beat that, you have to have at least Demo 2 (+30% to the Explosive +20% = +26%). Meaning that a base of 100 w/ Explosive makes it 120, so that extra 6 points from Demo 2 is actually only a +5% increase. I think for 2 perk points Bloody Mess is better (+10%). While I‚Äôm not sure if it affects both the base damage and the explosive damage, even if it only affects base that‚Äôs 5 points that isn‚Äôt affected by Explosive Resistance. 
---
And then consider Bloody Mess 3 vs Demo Expert 3; in that case, BM3 is either adding 15 or 18 points and Demo 3 is only adding 8, I think?
---
Gotta check that math in a moment.
---
lol, chill out my bro, just having fun :P  plenty of presents to go around even if you get a couple of yoinked out of your santatron :)
---
&gt;m, door at the front if you like and keypad door at the back to access your loot.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;For me he just stands in the doorway talking, but still collects items/presents. I prefer this because I like him as a decoration to my camp, so he's always in his little spot saying his Christmas lines.  
---
&gt;The collectron station should block people being able to get access into the room and your keypad door at the back will allow you access when needed, and stop others.
---
I can confirm he will collect in a 1x1 room with no door.
---
Damn!!! That looks awesome üòé üëèüèº üëèüèº 
---
Wish I had 1/10 of that kind of base building skill ... can‚Äôt even get Santa into a Radtoad ... lol
---
Great job
---
The what now glitch?
---
I had 5 I think, hemlock, monoghah, red rocket, munitions, and lakeside.  Going for 8 to 1p tomorrow üëç
---
31st
---
I have like 2 dozens of psychobuff and oddly no one is buying
---
Yeah, lets me build up a little ammo, then I can add this to glass caverns run.
---
Well if I ever see it.  It'll get sold so long as i'm not broke
---
I buy grape mentats anytime I see them among a few others
---
I sell most common chems and meds for 6-10 caps. Sometimes you will find a buyer for more but buyers are infrequent. Even at low prices they tend to stick for about a dozen customets before they sell.
---
Hopefully you saved the photo for memory!
---
He gave you a holiday gift!
---
Trade the first one away for something you need, it's a god roll.
---
Sell the latter for a higher price and enjoy your profit.
---
Oh man, i hope this isn't the case! It was broken when i got it through trade, i thought might have something to do with it?
---
heh heh tit
---
I hate these posts. This type of balancing is the only challenge this game has left. Especially since it makes logical sense that if your build is good for PvE, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for it to be good at PvP.
---
I hope so. Thanks.
---
Don't you know anything? This is the Fallout 76 community......
---
Bethesda could have a bake sale in their head office and the community would call it a scam because they sold Peanut Butter chocolate chip cookies, when they were clearly chocolate chunk.
---
I set my chems to 20c and they fly like hotcakes.
---
Holy fuck, 6,000 caps is 120 lost duels.
---
It should just go back to being a legendary I'd take that over explosive any day
---
Nope. They designed this to prevent dupers, and didn't take into account hoarders, so just don't delete important shit.
---
Needs weapon mods besides sight, needs faster reload animation, needs fan the hammer, AP and damage buff, as well as the ability to convert it to different ammo types (.45 and .38) to stop it from competing with the other 2 revolvers for the same ammo pool.
---
Put a lock on my bedroom (just in case an enemy breaks into my CAMP) so can go AFK and the XP booster at the same time - but not for hours, mins at the most..
---
My intention was to let new players know this, not know it all's who already have this knowledge.
---
Damn. I have 96k pounds of shit.
---
You're also potentially getting a 40 scrip discount on legendary weapons no?
---
Thanks, I actually have the plans but it‚Äôs WAY easier to just buy the mod.
---
Thanks for the offer but I'm on PC. The video helped a lot!
---
I buy psycho and boffout in bulk when I find it cheap.  like 10c a pop or less.  Reason being these are the components to psychobuff.
---
Me too on the SA mods.
---
Did it used to snow more?
---
Wow. That‚Äôs a lot.
---
Haven't played in 2 months... I'm getting no audio (I get audio on all other games and apps)... I updated Bethesda launcher, scan and repair did not work, before I uninstall and reinstall, any body else have this problem?
---
Depends? Firstly anything that uses a different ammo type.
---
If ADS another Semi-Auto Rifle - Lever Action, Handmade, Fixer.
---
If Sneak/Crit/VATS build, literally any ranged weapon that can be modified for VATS that you want to use.
---
Why integrating NPCs into the existing story and having an entirely new piece of story content are mutually exclusive options is beyond me. 
---
They said whole new main quest line. Integrating some NPCs into a modified original main story to maintain consistency for new characters and the evolution of the Wasteland doesn't prohibit there also being a new main quest line....
---
ITS A BASE DUMBASS
---
The city where legendary vendor is, has higher levels
---
There used to be a guaranteed one over by the vendor in Harper's Ferry.
---
Ya I buy anything with pockets when I am building up a new character. Lot of low levels lately on ps4, I have been tempted to act as a mysterious stranger and stalk them with my sniper rifle popping off the head of any monster they struggle with.
---
Both of those are great items.  The VE lever is solid though really higher rof weapons are best for vampires in general.  
---
Still though you'd pretty much never use stims if you already have a sniper build with that lever.  The explosive effect doubles up the vampires healing and thus you can heal quite a bit of health very quickly.  That said it's best on a full health build which I guess you don't use based on your post.  
---
As everyone else has already state that powered unyielding sentinel is god tier and you are nuts to sell it for anything other than 10k+ if not much more or better yet, trade it for something that perfectly suits your needs.
---
I'm doing a pharmacy type theme and so far I just price everything half of the 'suggested retail'.
---
Think you use to be able to use a vending machine to transfer between players. Heard they patched that though.
---
They did do GB furniture...
---
I think you're making assumptions about some NPCs being integrated into the original story (necessary to create continuity in an evolving wasteland)...
---
And those NPCs and integration BEING the new content/questline.
---
That isn't even the point at all. 
---
It doesn't make logical sense for the game to potentially force players to screw over their adventure mode character for a really good character in a side mode.
---
You're acting like Nuclear Winter is a mode full of content and it makes total sense for one mode to potentially screw over the other
---
Yes! I forgot that one üëç
---
I'd probably like nuclear winter if they didn't gimp everything for it.
---
It should've been a straight foot on ground experience no cards no mutations no nukes.
---
Or at least a separate version of it like that
---
It seems they are able to restore a character if you lose everything, but it may be from a save file that is several weeks old, meaning you lose all that progress.
---
How am I a dumbass, I am just reporting a bug.
---
Stopped playing awhile back, what do the gifts give you?
---
Ok? I wasn't talking down to you about anything, simply furthering the knowledge you gave.
---
really it's just scorchbeasts and SBQ that have massive explosive resist.
---
Fort venture
---
That is a great deal of fertilizer....oh wait...
---
Ok now I feel like I‚Äôm being screwed with. It won‚Äôt let me delete friends...im even on the website. I remove them, it says they‚Äôre removed, but the friend count doesn‚Äôt go down and they‚Äôre still on my friends list despite allowing me to request them as a friend. Did I die and this is hell?
---
Yes, it is. They mentioned awhile back that they extended it due to the holidays.
---
I personally don't find crit bonuses that useful for 2 handed because vats is spastic with melee. You're better off getting bonus to power attacks because that's a separate key press and with that you can take massive chunks out of high hp enemies.
---
...proof/link?
---
Not sure, you'd have to try it. It probably depends on whether you hit first or they do.
---
Makes sense to me, I know I was going, "man, it would be nice to not feel resentful that I'm not getting as much of this decent as I want due to the holidays..."
---
Good job, Bethesda!
---
OK so i just tested it (hadn't seen the challenge), first game i had 599xp and had both the first and second xmas challenge completed so no it doesn't reset between challenges. if you begin when the last one is out it will count towards all of them simustaneously
---
We have one.  Its that dead responder near the vault.  Put noob stuff on that corpse all the time.
---
Did you challenge the workshop? It sounds like it was already his by the time you got back - if that is the case you will not be able to do damage to him until you re-challenge the workshop
---
No the solution is simple. Hang out at a fissure. Every time you mine a piece a ultracite there will be a spawn. Mine one piece at a time, kill the wave, mine another. Obviously there will also be scorchbeasts but they might be legendary too. If you want high level go southwest.
---
Yeah, you can do that with any item in C.A.M.P. It's not a bug, it's just a feature in the game. Pretty useful when you low on supplies. Especially helpful for the low levels but could also help the high levels.
---
Sure thing man. Back before they patched Adrenal reaction, pre-patch 1.0.6, you could hit 150% dmg when under 20% without Nerd Rage or Bloody Mess. But since 1.0.6 it was nerfed down to 40% dmg at 20% health and at 10% health or less its 50% more dmg.
---

I feel like you're trying to force this idea of new content being tacked on and being jarring for existing players.
---
Just because a new player can meet some NPCs by following the original storyline doesn't mean long term characters won't be able to discover those NPCs in a non-organic way, via different/new quests having nothing to do with the original....
---
While new players may meet an NPC who returned to Appalachia, and now helps out new comers to the wasteland
---
Existing players could meet those very same NPCs through the opposite lens. The NPCs are the new comers to Appalachia, met through following new content not accessible in the early game. They could even seek out players at a certain point in a new quest line. 
---
Your assumption is "These NPCs are in a starter area and change how new players will experience the original story. To experience any new content they are involved with, it's going to be jarring and out of place because I'm well past that point in the game."
---
While there are numerous ways around that. 
---
Not to mention the fact that you could meet 42 other NPCs involved in post original story content and these NPCs you're worried about are intertwined in that as well.
---
How do you get those legendary things ?
---
Im still waiting on the damn tiled floor to come back, its so pretty and i didnt get it when it was out originally
---
I wouldn't down vote for someone else having an opinion. 
---
But it doesn't mean that opinion isn't short sighted and focused more on being disappointed than the 9847 other options you can't consider because they don't involve you being disappointed.
---
You are giving me the kind of technical info only Reddit has. So, a vampire explosive would benefit from the explosion.
---
You and me both man!! Take this gift. Hopefully it will provide some happiness.

I sell all plans for 1 cap. Gets them out of my inventory fast and rewards a buyer who does not have the plan or feels they can flip it.
---
I have sold a copy small letters for one cap, it is common if you do workshops on private world.
---
What are graps going for? I got super stoned last night maxing my stash at 1am with legendarys and just made a shit load of graps im thinking about 60 plus?
---
The assumption that the only was to meet/interact with these specific NPCs is through the lens/context of a new character. 
---
Existing characters could meet them in a plethora of ways in different contexts. On day one a new player may be be greeted by them and the player is considered a new comer to the wasteland. 
---
While existing characters could meet them via 93746 other possible options, and in the context that the player is not the new comer, but the NPC. 
---
And context new players would eventually see as they progress and finish the original story.
---
I just shaved mine off because I was tired of kids trying to crawl in my lap and the ensuing misunderstandings
---
I thought it was a great price, really. The explosive effect alone would mean 100-1500, I guess.
---
Are they going to address what‚Äôs been happening or nah?
---
Since most of Wastelanders seems instanced I'm probably gonna keep doing what I do in sandbox mode, just blowing up stuff and mowing down enemies with my built up toons. Appalachia is a playground, and I don't want to be invested in something that has less impact on the world than my fist and bullets.
---
What are the benefits behind Marine Armor? I trust Combat Armour way too much. My rifleman is kind of a "forest loner" and he wears a full set of trapper armor because of radiation and that.
---
Drop em. I have a random odds and ends vendor where i put plans, excess ore, bobbles, magazines, etc. If it does not go I drop it, if it is worth something to someone I drop it near other players at a train station.
---
That‚Äôs weird
---
And I was just letting you know that I already understood that. This post was not made to help out vets that already know the nuances of the game.
---
Thanks for the help ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I had it on my vending machine for exactly 10000 caps. Some honest guy came to me saying that he could pay with 10000 5.56 ammo, but I wanted money for paper, you know. Gotta cach'em all.
---
Thank you! I get paid next friday and rn am completely broke but I wanna buy some of the atomic shop items but by the time I get paid the stuff I want will be gone
---
You just listed my favorite things to do! Lol I also love being to play with my husband!  Stay filthy!!
---
No joke. I remember people saying stuff like ‚Äúwow emptied all my scrap and freed 300lbs.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt believe it until I broke and subscribed for a month. Stash weight went from ~600lbs down to *150lbs*
---
The dailies give them and so do the campfire tales events. Its like a 20 pct chance I think
---
The bug parts at Dolly sods, and the toxic cleanup at kiddy kroner both give out badges sometimes. You can do both everyday and don't have to wait for them to start.
---
Stimpaks seem to draw customers, my fast travel traffic is higher when I have stimpaks to sell even a small quantity. 
---
A lot will shop near their camps so place a shop where you see other camps like flatwoods and whitesprings.
---
assault rifle plan not on this list
---
The perk is always very helpful regardless of the stats it does, at least to me. I use the explosive gatling gun and with it equipped I always do massive damage. It even hurts the scorchbeast queen, just not very rapidly. My anti-tank grenades (MIRV Grenades) hurt sheepsquach by a huge chunk of his health with only 1 grenade of it. I dont care that the stat says it doesn't do much. It really does. I always have the perk on at all times since I basically only use explosive weapons/grenades a lot. If you're the same, I definitely suggest you having a maxed out demolition perk equipped. Itll come in help big time.
---
Blocker and dodgy for bloodied guy, too. Be sure and get a couple pieces of armor with poison resistance and stay away from the high capacity backpack, you'll have a bitch of a time with rads, 60 carry weight isnt worth it imho. I think INT is too high, as others said, you dont need Demo expert so high. You could put some of those INT points into END and use cannibal + lead belly or even Fireproof. I don't use Dense torso mod, I use Pneumatic, so Fireproof is great. I'd ditch the electrically charged/unstable isotope mutations, they're lame. Maybe pick up Egg Head if you do drop INT, its a good 12-15% XP bonus. Bird Bones is good too, you're using Class Freak so it's not huge STR hits you're taking. Plus you'll have Unyielding gear to give hella stats. Sorry for the smashed together comments, at work.. time to go home!
---
Stick em on the ceiling
---
Got a month instead of buying atoms.
---
It's worth it.  Private servers make workshops usable.
---
Make all the bullets and fusion cores you want.
---
No more junk management just pop your tent and unload the junk.  Plus put it on opposite of map from camp and fast travel from one or other to where you need to go for less caps.
---
Put on as many weight perks as posible. If I take off batteries included and through hiker I can't pick up anything, because of my weight.
---
You have way better rifles than me, but the point is the same. You don't need melee unless your rifles are too much similar.
---
Your post is pretty misleading since it‚Äôs talking about the lights yet the lights in the picture are obtainable ingame without the atom shop...
---
Any daily quest could drop them?
---
I just leave my Santatron unlocked. Feel free to take whatever you need.
---
I think there is a reason to still have it over 100. If you have the perk to max it to 300% then why not? I do that to all my weapons &amp; armour because it last a whole lot longer. Well, depending on which weapon you use and or how much you get damaged of course. Like The Dragon will definitely decrease its CND rapidly regardless what percent it is, that's why I got rid of it. But regular weapons like revolvers, smg, assault ect. Will last a lot longer with or without explosive rounds.
---
I understand that. Just trying to keep it simple to one item that was available for free in the atomic shop.
---
I would love that one!
---
This looks fabulous! Very creative. Now when I look back at my crib, it looks so dull and boring
---
I have been faaaaar more successful with Line in the Sand. I am getting 4-8 gifts each time I join. Plus, lots of ammo and exp.
---
I don't find them often but here's how I price chems and booze go to a vendor put on hard bargain check how much the vendor will buy it for sell one see how much it costs to buy one sell them for somewhere between those prices
---
Just contact support, why would you be okay with just losing everything and starting over when you can get it restored bud
---
I know the feeling.  Wishing you well.
---
You generally need to hang them off a ceiling or some other object.
---
I'd be willing to buy them for 60 because I use them for the plans I need to buy pa mostly
---
Turns out the big tree on the right and the rainbow lights are gone already.
---
Absolutely and vampires is popular with a fair amount of people, good buy.
---
Have you tried the perk loadout manager on [Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)? It requires SFE to save and load in game but it's the best option since launch.
---
It's meant to be a grind. I only just got all the possible plans/outfits for the Pioneer Scouts and I do the dailies, well, daily. It takes a long time to stack badges since the drop rate is so low. Make sure you check the requirements for all the badges and see which ones are even doable for you and do those first since they guarantee a badge. Then just keep grinding those dailies. 
---
Just to let you know, I often find Legendary creatures while grinding Stings N Things, and between the stingwing location and the tick location is a random encounter spawn that is pretty interesting.  Sometimes is a dead trick-or-treater, sometimes it's a sheepsquatch. Good luck.
---
Well still, it's pretty simple as the santatron. The only glitch I have with placing it down is it keeps saying its floating on a lot of areas when it's not. Pretty frustrating.
---
I'm confused. You're not listing anything that wasn't already in the game from the start...
---
I have a level 5 Sledge Hammer (dirty grey suit, shades, blond hair, revolver, gunslinger) waiting for Wastelanders. I feel it might be interesting (unique, new for those of us who have more than 1300 hours in) to play the game with a guy like that. I will fast-travel to Vault 76 and start fresh.
---
They said this would be something coming in 2020.
---
It was part of a bundle last year, but doesn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôre getting it this year
---
Submerged train yard out in the cranberry bog. It'll have high level scorched or super mutants
---
If you plan and budget, I don't think you're Bethesda's target audience. I'm pretty sure impulse buyers are more profitable.
---
No the ever upwards ones. Delivering bug parts and the toxic clean up
---
What platform?
---
I envy you. Would love to share it with my wife, but truth is... we have two small children and we tag-team the shit out of the situation. 
---
Enjoy it for all of us.
---
Overseers' CAMP box. I put stuff in there
---
I would love to use that but I'm on PS4 unfortunately
---
I imagine the game will do its best, which is: you jump servers and it's all cool. Like Whitespring bots.
---
Nice one, that would be a very requested feature from me. Would definitely make messing with load outs more fun
---
Works like a charm, once you figure out how to get it to work, which can take a bit of reading between the lines.
---
You forgot the biggest reason they aren't doing it. Time spent not making MTX.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about a second character creation just for Wastelanders just due to the fact that there adding npcs right outside vault 76 and going through the journey again with human npcs around should make for a more exciting experience.
---
I‚Äôve been begging for this for months. Scrolling through all these superfluous perk cards is a nuisance.
---
I must have done Campfire Tales 100 times, only got 2 badges, so...
---
I use an instigating grognak's axe or instigating super sledge. I use Martial Artist and a couple other perk cards to help out. Pop some psychobuff or fury and a melee bobblehead and it kills most stuff with a single hit, so I don't really worry much about the DPS.
---
Well, that would have been important information to add on to your post. Regardless, you're SOL until the big B implements a loadout system. They say they're working on one, but don't get you hopes up.
---
I've seen/been in a few brawls around Whitespring Station. Literally just hang out and start throwing PvP emotes, you can get a fight pretty reliably.
---
As others have said, ammo factory or Poseidon workshops are also good. Taking either is basically the universal sign for "I'm down for a fight." Ammo factory is definitely more fun to fight in.
---
Marine Armour is a Trapper Armour with better DR/ER iirc.
---
I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen anything posted about baiting people with the gifts and hiding nearby yet.
---
Find any Instigating + faster swing weapon and that's it. To be honest, weight reduction is a bliss (I have an instigating faster swing reduced weight multipurpose axe which does it all)
---
I'm pretty sure you have to be the one to swipe the keycard and put in the code for it to count unless that changed at some point. But you can -- and should -- definitely tag along with a more experienced friend your first time.
---
i kept it and also got the paint and the like armored ranger armor thing with the shoulder pads too when it came out... cancelled and can still make the armor after it was cancelled
---
Oh shit. Time to collect Marine Armor. Something to do, I guess.
---
I prefer the fishing gaff pole hook with the 4 prongs but wish we could add üî• or electricity to it for my fun to be great.
---
Scout Armor mods are at the military wing terminals. If you're an Enclave General, they're available.
---
Now I‚Äôm worried that many of the new Wastelanders missions will be low-mid level missions with easy enemies and quests in the forest...they HAVE to let us at least make private servers completely level up to the player soon if they do this. I‚Äôm level 175, I don‚Äôt want to be running around the forest doing new missions but fighting level 5 scorched...
---
When was the last time you did it? There was a bug where the dailies weren't dropping badges, but they actually patched that a few months back, so now they all drop at about 20%. 
---
But I get it, RNG is a fickle bitch.
---
Fallout first resets for that week for day one buyers. I‚Äôve been speculating the bundles were going to come out then so you can only afford one.
---
Glassed Cavern. Ya, it's near a fissure site, but it's indoors and super manageable. Also, Freddys House of Horrors sometimes spawns Scorched that are high level.
---
Umm everywhere near site prime üòÇ
---
And the antique shop sometimes spawns Scortched.
---
üòÇ
---
I like power attack for the instigating weapons, but I understand the idea behind swing speed for when you get swarmed, but I sneak and dont get swarmed to often if I can oneshot things
---
The baseball bat is really fun to use and one of the stronger types of two handed. Instigating or vampires with faster swing speed or power attack are great rolls. It also feels like to me it slightly swings better then other weapons and swinging from the side felt like it made the hit box better, not sure if either is true but that‚Äôs how it felt. You can also get outfits with it baseball costume or greaser outfit and put a chain mod on it to play as the dude from walking dead üòÇ
---
I buy chems that are 30 caps or less. In particular, Daddy-o and formula p, I use for my junkies build and they are kind of hard to get. Psycho and buffout I get too So can make fury and mentats are always helpful.
---
For you to crit you need to head shot. Melee does not let you choose specific limbs so that doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Run through and clear all enemies first. Then backtrack hitting the veins one at a time. I think they only spawn if no other enemies near.  I did it today got 11 small and 6 regular in about an hour. Plus legendaries.
---
Yea had the same deal, just gotta get rid of stuff before you starve to death and loose all your junk (if you die you will loose a bunch of junk if you have more then can fit in a bag
---
I'd wear that.
---
I think I csn explain that. Datamining showed that chameleon armor does thos:
---
"Chameleon Armor:

ChameleonEffectArmorMod "Stealth Field" [MGEF:000976E0]
---
x20"
---
And it was datamined that "Harder to detect" armor does this:
---
"Harder to Detect Legendary 3rd effect:
---
Mod Detection Movement x .95
---
Mod Detection Sneak Skll + 15"
---
For comparison, Sneak perk cards do this:
---
"
---
Sneak Perk Cards:
---
Lvl 1:
---
Mod Detection Movement x .76
---
Mod Detection Sneak Skll + 25
---
Lvl 2:
---
Mod Detection Movement x .62
---
Mod Detection Sneak Skll + 50
---
Lvl 3:
---
Mod Detection Movement x .50
---
Mod Detection Sneak Skll + 75
---
¬†
---
Then some people jumped to a conclusion that Stealth Foeld does not apply to NPC detection and started spreadind their opinion as "datamined fact" whereas datamining only showed that Chameleon armor works in a different way than "Harder to detect " armor/Sneak perk skill.
---
I've been experiencing stuttering too, lately.
---
Why is it unfortunate? What exactly is in a locked box that you'd want?
---
Fallout 1, released in 1997, had a fully functional trade menu. You could take as many items as you wanted from your partner's inventory, offer up whatever you wanted from yours, and you saw the relative values. Since the game was only on PC, you could even type out a specific amount instead of messing around with a scroll line/arrows
---
The FOnline games (FREE multiplayer mods for fallout 2, made on a modified engine by fans, idk exact date but I played one of these servers in like 2009) had an amazing barter system. It allowed any two players to engage in trade (both need to accept, you can choose whether or not your partner sees what's in your inventory). Both of you offer as many items as you want. If your partner left their inventory as open, you could drag items from their inventory to request them. The trade will not happen unless both players confirm all of the items in there. Any change in either player's offerings will unconfirm the trade.
---
Then fallout 76, in 2019, has a messy system where you scroll through potentially hundreds of items searching for something specific, can only sell it for caps, and has constant issues around lag/interface that might make you accidentally sell the wrong item or for the wrong amount. This is fine
---
Never had a problem with crashing with this game or any other using wifi. It's also not a viable option in my house.
---
Go to crash history and take a pic of the list.
---
The only "Bethesda pls" I'm currently comfortable with
---
Is a +50 or +250?
---
Only the 250 is broken. You may already know that but you didn‚Äôt mention it in your post.

Give us everything. Why Not? They DGAF about lore. For Atoms Sake, they dont care about anything. my support tickets been pending for 8 days. I ask Bethesda Support twitter and it's the same canned response..  8 days in a Row..
---
I seem to get it much worse when I try to melee. I've just been avoiding melee, because my game freezes or drops to 1 fps anytime I swing a weapon
---
It happens routinely with me, but I can't pinpoint any rhyme or reason at this point.
---
They already are exploiting pretty much anything you can do with the in-game console perfectly fine. You seen the BoS airships being spawned in? Or preston garvey? Or the 5* legendaries? People getting massive stacks of those fallout 1st loot boxes with 100+ v94 steel?
---
Besides, letting people exploit things to figure out how is LITERALLY THE POINT OF A TEST SERVER
---
hahaha
---
Thanks, funny enough I was there today and some dude was just shooting, I ran up to him, he gave me an emote, I gave him one, and we started pvping lmao. We teamed up afterwards and took down some teams
---
One.  Yes Froglegs does help with mines and grenades( as long as they don't have the grenadier perk). A sprint jump can get you out of most explosives unless your crazy unlucky with the grenades bounce trajectory.  If you refuse to acknowledge that then you're just lying.  
---
Second.  I am the Chem fiend [murder hobo](https://streamable.com/tulug) with a polehook. Obviously you can see why( or maybe you can't?) froglegs is a huge problem for Melee builds.  Considering its quite literally impossible to have a functioning Melee Build and froglegs at the same time. (run for your knife and marathoner are absolute requirements because Running attacks are Melees bread and butter)
---
Thirdly. I never said I was losing to people because of froglegs. You put those words in my mouth. My exact words were "Froglegs is a get out of jail free card." Which it entirely is. It's a solution to many problems. Which is precisely why the vast majority of people agree they are a crutch and it's unfortunate it's absolutely meta. 
---
Sad your ego needs to try and flex itself in defense of froglegs.
---
Would be an insta buy off atom shop.  I‚Äôm always amazed at how little weapon customization they‚Äôve added when that is one of the more prominent ways to differentiate ourselves.
---
I set up a few workshops with santatrons in a private server and got 2 gifts in 3 hours. I went to public server and picked one lock and got 7. Yea it‚Äôs worth it
---
I don‚Äôt think lots of people are reporting not being able to play the game for more than a minute at a time.
---
is there a pic or video of an explosive alien blaster? i need to see this, it's been a passion of mine to see that piece of garbage actually get fixed and become viable
---
Yes, it's frustrating as hell, and I've debated installing either the balloons or NukaGirl replacer mod just because of this.
---
Oh I saw that it was in one of the data mined pictures so I was jw :(
---
We SEE her??
---
How did you get that much stuff? And what does it primarily consist of? I can potentially imagine that without any weight perks, but if you mean 96k WITH weight perks, I legit don't know how I could do that without obsessively picking up every item I see for months on end
---
I don‚Äôt see a need for changing the main quest, seems more like a reboot than an expansion. It bothers me that new players won‚Äôt be able to experience the original story. It‚Äôs like an alternate timeline where the original is erased.
---
Same
---
It‚Äôs necessary to have an a human NPC teach you about how the camp system works? Really?
---
I mean, at this point the regular bethesda servers are just one big modded lobby. It's like MW2. The playground bullies took over and there's nowhere safe left to go
---
Also I JUST found out today that the pipboy doesn't show your badges correctly so you have to check them at the vendor. Ended up I had 12 saved.
---
The placement exploit
---
I don't at all.
---
5.56 is used as currency, it sells at 1:1. I know it's an extra step, but within an hour of posting on the trading sub you'd have 10k caps for 10k 5.56, as opposed to the 9000 caps you'd get for selling it out of your vendor.
---
I‚Äôm entitled to my own opinion. I don‚Äôt know why you feel like trying to prove my opinion wrong. I am upset that people will no longer be able to experience the story as it was originally written. It feels like we are losing something. This isn‚Äôt the direction I wanted the expansion to go.
---
I wanna wield an oversized anchor
---
...Too far?
---
It has to be more than that,  I can carry 1721 in Excavator before I crawl instead of run, plus the 800 on stash...
---
There was a patch the unequipped all PA parts from their frames.  which greatly increased weight.  Try reassembling any PAs you had
---
Im the only grinch on my private server... perhaps more of a scrooge?
---
Good point. Taxes.
---
I fit the bill up until the outcast paint. Can‚Äôt seem to stay interested in NW lol
---
yeah i dont know what the fuck happened. She and I were on a team, the guy killed me with a sneak attack, when she went to attack, after he killed her, she dropped 6000 caps. It was not a good night, i was pissed off.
---
Lewis burg and big bend tunnel. Lewisburg has a chance to spawn different stuff but big bend is right there and always has scorched.
---
Lvl 3 boxes can be a source of good plans.
---
As others said, 20% normally and 32% with max demolition expert. HOWEVER, there are two exceptions - explosive energy weapons with splitters deal full damage per projectile and fire many projectiles at once, so the damage adds way the fuck up. IIRC there was some debate about whether or not demolition expert even affects explosive energy weapons though, not sure if that ever got resolved. The other exception is an explosive dragon, although those don't exist in the purveyor pool and the regular drop pool was matched with it, so I think those are gone from regular drops. An explosive dragon still gains +20% per projectile, not total, so it's +80% explosive damage normally and +100% with a two shot explosive. Then it's +128% normally with demo expert and +160% two shot with demo expert.
---
Yeah, this happened to me.  Reassembling fixed the issue
---
Can it also have the same stats as the sbq?
---
They would have had to purposely code a level lock into the drop table formulas. 
---
And it wasn't the plans that were level locked, it was the drop rates, which wouldn't apply to the holiday tables.
---
If you‚Äôre hostile, yes. They can possibly see your red arrow above your noggin and your dot on the compass. If neutral, if they happen to put their crosshairs on you, they can see your health bar, and even interact with you if they come up to you.
---
Be cool if you could pick the "canvas" when your turned it in for like an easy, hard, very hard. Lot of cool stuff you could do. I don't think this is really on their radar but if it is, neat way to do it imo.
---
Ah, I see what you meant now. I thought you meant something else by "the way it stacks damage". 
---
Anyway, I have good news for you...  They reverted that nerf back to the original values in Patch 7.  [Here's a link to the patch notes.](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4rzMQ3PdnK5hOjt1fc9VAV/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-13-2019)
---
Side note: The pre-nerf list you sent is missing +50% at &lt;20% health. That's +63% with Strange in Numbers. [\(Proof\)](https://i.imgur.com/3KkBPEm.png)

You can't die from lack of food/water...

100% Yes.  This isn‚Äôt WOW.  I don‚Äôt want 5-10 Alts to play.  Just let me do everything with one character.

Hi! Thanks a lot for your tests! If you want a short link to the datamined info here it is (in case you haven't seen it already):

Isn't the coat and well helmet the best part of that outfit?

Found a. Inch of e star ones in helvet

ia on my level 5 toon
---
The steam version would still be through Bethesda, just integrated with the Steam platform for the friends list and stuff.
---
Sounds like Karen
---
Yeah if you wanna look jive as fuck
---
If they're being removed (or limited time) it clearly states "4 days only" right on top of the item.
---
I agree, it does suck (especially when you're an adult &amp; don't play all the time). I missed out on the Nuka cola cooler, but now when I want something I just buy it.
---
Guessing that's what they're banking on.
---
Did you ever find it? Mine is missing
---
Uninstall and reinstall, sounds like a file was corrupted during the update.
---
Bethesda made the santa bot have better odds

Might come out Tuesday

Platform?

PS4.
---
I would but I run xb1

Thank you!!!! üòä

Oh... Well... Thanks Bethesda
---
It's one of those cheap tactics companies use to artificially inflate and extend their games viability. Welcome to gaming 2019.
---
A lil' glitchy :p Technically it's a camera glitch you're right :P But the game allows you to do worse than that. You cannot exploit it to take advantage on other players but it's nice for exploration.
---
1. you cannot be attacked by other players untill you are level 5. at level 5 go to map and set pacifist to on. that will prevent you from accidently attacking other players. teammates will get you killed people on your friendlist will get you killed. I am not saying never team and never friend anyone, just be selective. dont just add randos. 
---
2. throwing knifes and board are the best two things for any lowbie in the forest just starting out. with throwing knifes you can rule the forest. it will take a minute to figure out how to use them but stick with it and once mastered you will be able to easily advance to level 15 or higher. once you leave the forest you should start looking at your other weapon systems and going to what you prefer. 
---
3. have fun in appallachia
---
Yeah I agree. ;P
---
Yeah I agree
---
There are chaps?!
---
This changes everything!
---
Wwwhhaat?
---
You‚Äôre getting presents every time? I‚Äôve literally never gotten a gift in my Santatron, only the standard junk the regular collectron collects
---
My question is how many Atoms it‚Äôs gonna cost.
---
So, I‚Äôm not 100% sure in that first one. I believe if a level 3 player becomes Wanted, they can be attacked. Not sure though. May have to test that.
---
That's pretty impressive. I'm still after those jumpsuits.
---
whyte s link is an excellent guide for junkies. extremely powerful build. personally I like vampirie build I am currently using for less inventory micromanagement and overall lazier playstyle but I do miss being able to just melt sb and queens. ultracite junki laser gat was stupidly strong. I was accused of hacking many times lol. I only left it for vampiric because for the entire rest of the game I felt like I was extremely overkill. I may go back to it for awhile just for the deeps.
---
I did uninstall and reinstalled it, that made it stable enough for me to play long enough to find out exactly what was causing the crash. I can repair, scarp, etc, but crafting crashes my game.
---
For example is it better to buy the three star weapon for 100 script or the armor for 60 script
---
hmm interesting.
---
I'm level 115 and was able to get the plasma grenade plan. I probably opened at least 50 gifts before I got it though.
---
Good point. I dig it!
---
And people wonder why servers crash and act unstable
---
Ah, only those who are either absolutely horrible at NW or those who are on PC and have had to deal with countless hackers would say something like that
---
Make a NW specific character, there's nothing stopping you.
---
Using SPECIAL limits the number of dmg perk someone can run, it's a good thing.
---
I do wish we had a power armor gauntlet.
---
What do you think will be removed and why?
---
Good evening and happy Thursday! (pst) üòÇ
---
Someone stole from my Santatron as well. The noobs can keep the couple of small gifts they get from picking the lock because it's more rewarding to watch a third of the server descend upon the dude with the bounty.
---
I‚Äôve had a very lonely, solo blast since Beta...made a few friends that I kept at an arms length because, well...wasteland. That being said, I‚Äôm mentally ready to open my heart and my workshop to the NPC‚Äôs
---
Not entirely true.
---
Trolls don‚Äôt listen to reason and think everyone that comes after them are the real trolls. It‚Äôs sad that people like this feed off stuff like that.
---
It is discharging.  Ib be fine with ONLY being able to use it in PA and it weighing 20lbs lol
---
Wait...does Santratron only drop gifts if you have the tree? I haven‚Äôt seen mine bring anything but scrap lol
---
The 3rd perk on a legendary weapon is typically useless...I always read the general rule is 2* weapons and 3* armor
---
Grind, don‚Äôt give up, play every event you can (level permitting)
---
Okidokie.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm on the OP‚Äôs side...I‚Äôve never cared for kicking long coats while I run in 3rd person
---
It was updated yesterday. Make sure you check now
---
He can sell the important stuff to a robot vendor and have a friend buy it back.
---
Seems like 50% of the scorched have been immortal, headless and frozen since the holiday event started last week. I saw 5 just inside Morgantown airport...to bad we don‚Äôt earn XP from individual damage rather than kills lol
---
The coat and helmet are cool but I think it would be different and unique to have a variation without the coat.
---
The cap is 1500 over your normal carry. If your normal carry is 300 then you need to hit 1800 to max out.
---
Bah, I can't get the door to face the right way. My alternative is just to box him in, then manually move a wall out of the way in build mode to access the stash.
---
I think you had a seizure.
---
Ahh, gotcha! Thanks for the heads-up!
---
as a level 115 console player, constantly having to switch perks in and out is painful...we definitely need this ASAP. I would pay real money to have a cash out/trade in option on owned perks too.
---
* 1) I've only learned mods from scrapping.  
---
* 1A)  No magazine size that I've seen or learned.  But there are Quad Legendary Teslas.
---
* 2) Those traits being Legendaries, you cannot 'convert' any existing weapons to those, you have to find one.  They do exist though.
---
Throat Slicer from Nuka World...for the love of Atom, please
---
There is something stopping me, I dont want to first of all level up an entirely new character and then re earn my 35 levels in nuclear winter.
---
So yes, there is Infact something stopping me and many others. 
---
Also I never said they should just not use special but it should be 100% seperate from adventure mode.
---
I'll try doing these.
---
I've done em before not to bad to complete.
---
Or they could implement it as a feature without requiring players to pay for it
---
Calm down...we have scorched walking around in Santa outfits FFS, it‚Äôs Christmas....who cares
---
Wait, i thought it was a seperate mode?
---
That's a joke that it uses your main characters special stats....
---
So half assed
---
As a TSE rifle build, I buy any and every explosive bobble head and ballistic bock I can find
---
I own a vampire Tesla so yes they exist
---
Did you seek revenge when you died? If you respawned normally then you wouldn't be able to do damage to him until he shot back
---
Agreed, the lever is arguably the best gun in the game overall but if you don‚Äôt have a rifleman explosive build...sell that thing for bank and buy something you can use. The marine armor is kind of a god roll, same thing.
---
Try a plasma rifle with a flamer barrel. It counts as a semi-automatic rifle in terms of perks that effect it but it‚Äôs fully automatic and a highly effective close range weapon.
---
Me: Let's see what this vendor has in its invent-
---
*Game crashes*
---
Calm down...it was a figure of speech, I‚Äôm just saying that something like that is that valuable to me at this point in my wasteland career
---
I understand.  Here's my situation.  I was member of a BOS outfit. I roamed the map in my BOS T60 power armor with Elder paint that I had endlessly grinned for.  But something happened that really burned me with that group.  Months prior, I didn't give a damn about he outcast paint either. But after this falling out, suddenly I had to have the outcast paint and nothing could stop me from getting it.  It had a deep symbolic significance to me. So there it is.
---
Bah Humbug
---
Wanted to buy reindeer ears. Apparently they're only available for one week during the Christmas event, instead of during the entire Christmas event. Guess I'm keeping my money :|
---
I‚Äôm with you, I don‚Äôt even bother equipping lock pick or hacker
---
In your case, then, I get it. I mean, I‚Äôm all for joining my man, I just don‚Äôt have the outcast paint. If you‚Äôd still wanna have me, my DMs are open.
---
We can all agree 76 is kind of it‚Äôs own pocket universe, I‚Äôm all for it...bring on the VIM Atom Cats power armor skins
---
It's common knowledge actually, that many of the old server issues were due to the MASSIVELY duped inventories of dupers, and mules. The main issue we have now is all the firsters with infinite scrap storage. That is guaranteed to cause latency issues that will only worsen down the road. The solution was this weight cap, that ended up fucking over people like OP that obsessively hoard loot, or other goods. It didn't work then, and it won't work now, unless you take into account that people like OP are now potentially forced to sub to keep said hoard of loot, then Bugthesda will only see it as a win.
---
It's 20% from the first point and 10% from each point after. 
---
The explosive legendary major does 20% bonus damage
---
20% x 20% = 4%
---
20% x 10% = 2%
---
Demolition expert adds 4% damage with the first point and 2% with each additional point
---
I thought they gave each faction vendor all their faction plans a long time ago...are certain ones still randomly populated?
---
No. Only diseases.
---
Pick up console, do 360, throw it at tv,?????, Profit
---
The Santatron seems to produce better in the workshops for me than the one in my camp
---
I got my first gift this afternoon, no tree.
---
It does not max out. I have multiple screenshots in my post history proving that it continues to add damage all the way down to 5% health.
---
Rad Snow, BOOM!
---
Well you sound interesting. I'm considering maybe another rank for power armor builds who don't have outcast paint. I sent you a DM. Let's talk.
---
Agreed, most hordes aren‚Äôt an issue for my explosive rifleman build with any of my 3 semi auto TSE but after the original nerfpocalypse, any Scorchbeast, legendary or normal will soak up 100 5.56 to the face at minimum before going down...it‚Äôs not even worth fighting them solo anymore. I used to melt the bastards.
---
Ok great lol I considered the tree but it just doesn‚Äôt flow with the 365 Halloween Mothman Camp...I wouldn‚Äôt have even applied the Santatron skin without the gift bonus
---
Then don't. Stop playing NW, there's nothing stopping you.
---
You‚Äôre having fun...and ruining some poor noobs wasteland Christmas... dick move, grinch lol
---
It's way less than that. The explosive legendary effect adds 20% damage and the first point of demo expert is 20% of that and the rest are only 10%.
---
20% of 20% is 4%. The first point of demo expert gives 4% more damage. That's it. The rest of the points give 2%  each for a total of 12% bonus damage.
---
On the one hand, I'm annoyed that players have to resort to this level of rigamarole because it doesn't 'just work'. On the other hand, I see this sort of stuff and applaud the intelligence and creativity of the builder. Well done!
---
Nope this is the winter NW gifts stacked on the atomic shop Christmas trees.
---
Went for a present üéÅ avalanche üèÇ
---
Imagine still not knowing the glitch.
---
It is a better game when you do that, because some weapons (explosive) fall apart really fast. It's not fun to spend an hour scavenging for the materials to repair the weapons you use for scavenging the resources to repair the weapons... Etc.
---
Other than rarely needing to repair your weapon and wasting more junk? That perk maxed out saves a TON of resources for people (like myself) using fragile guns like the lever rifle...I used to waste atoms on repair kits weekly, I haven‚Äôt bought one in months after applying that perk
---
That's not how you do the glitch.
---
nah under a minute mostly at peak you'll get in instantly
---
That's now how do the glitch either.
---
I dig the Festivus...I really should play NW more often lol
---
That's not how you do the glitch, there's an even more efficient way.
---
Frog legs is BS in close quarters, although the good thing is once you learn which players run frog legs, it's much easier to track them because they almost ALL jump when they take damage (from a distance anyways, its still hard to do it very close).  I wouldn't be sad if it went away, though.  I don't run frog legs personally and win plenty of matches, so it is by no means required.
---
That's not the best way to do the glitch, chief.
---
Honestly, maxed weaponsmith perk is a must for anybody using a fragile gun like the Fixer or in my case, the Lever rifle. I used to burn through atoms and resources using Repair kits...even with the Lever which is one of the fastest breaking guns in the game, I haven‚Äôt had to buy repair kits in a couple months
---
Go on
---
Should this be a PSA?
---
I thank you for you being a true hero and standing up for people who couldn't, are you a big fan of the brotherhood by any chance?
---
Very cool, but you forgot to mention that Arktos originally made the fungus, which was later taken by the Enclave and tested on the bats to make scorchbeasts. It wasnt an Enclave creation.
---
I'm adding stuff to my camp and I check the map for a second. I see a level 22 coming close so I go outside and hang out. He or she comes in sneak mode and goes directly for the Santatron computer. It's inside a room and you walk through a unlocked door to get to it, a separate building.
---
I turned pacifist off (felt liberating) and went to town on the little fella. He or she freaked and ran into the water trying to get away. I'm a bloodied build fully loaded going rage on them. The little guy died in the water.
---
Santatron is locked now. So lock your Santatrons and check your map while your gone. I couldn't believe it..
---
My rifleman carried an instigating machete, but never got to use it. In fact, a fixer modded to fire .38 would be better. 
---
Nowadays, my rifleman carries his bloodied lever action and an instigating combat rifle. So I sell everything which isn't .45.
---
Then come claim my bounty :)
---
Aside from a melee build, I‚Äôve noticed All Rise is pretty in line with most other 2 handed heavies as far as damage goes. I own quite a few melee perk cards that I usually don‚Äôt equip...the All Rise was the only melee I carried from the time I got it until a couple weeks ago when I finally just cashed it in for scrip. That being said, with only one or two melee strength perks equipped, a 2* Instigating Fire Axe is doing more damage per second than the All Rise did for me previously.
---
Which one?
---
Glassed Cavern, chief!
---
3. Automatic is a mod so most likely you will have to convert a semi-auto, not sure if autos drop.
---
Lmao Anyone that says that with a ‚Äú :) ‚Äú after it is a bloodied one shorter in PVP...I‚Äôd rather just leave you a wrapped box of coal and make you live with your shame
---
100% Bruhthesda fan
---
More likely many of the rarer plans become common and a new batch of rare items are introduced
---
Maybe plans, recipes, creatures. Maybe some sections of the map will not be accessible anymore and other named locations will replace them. 
---
The game barely can carry its own weight as it is. Imagine it being 40 percent bigger. It scares the shit out of me.

---
3rd one is typically useless but the ceiling is higher. 3* is the only way you can get RW90, -35%Vats Cost or 15% faster reload which makes a gun go from great to outsranding
---
Ohhh so you just mean for stability reasons...I haven‚Äôt had a lot of trouble lately but I can see your point, the past wounds are still kinda fresh lol
---
Does it matter if you have it set to scrap or junk?
---
nope, pc, sorry though my chem supply is pretty solid atm
---
Ok, strong argument
---
Nope killed several tonight.
---
I own an anti-armor faster fire and a furious faster fire. They can be modded to suit your build. Don't use them because I hate the noise when full auto.
---
So many questions now.
---
If the wastelanders are instanced, if Im in a party and someone enters one, do I get portaled across West Virginia into that instance?
---
If the wastelanders are instanced, if I enter one, does my C.A.M.P. go away? Can someone take that spot so when I exit, I have to find a new server?
---
If the wastelanders are instanced, will it 'server hop' you upon exiting the instance?
---
And last but not least: If the wastelanders are instanced, will there now be EVEN LESS THAN THREE PEOPLE ON ANY GIVEN SERVER?
---
You are correct on that but after thousands of 3rd perk bashing burns, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to waste the extra 40 scrip per purchase
---
By glitch I mean a glitch in your favor.
---
Not sure to be honest. I just switch it over from Camp build to the Santatron and drop. Than he's on his merry way üòÖ
---
but his wording is poor and probably needs the work.
---
Yeahnot great with the keyboards, found a bunch of 3 stars in helvetia on my level 5 guy, been finding a shit ton.
---
I used to pick most 3 rank locks, just for the chance at plans and tech data.  I‚Äôm hardly doing that anymore.
---
I found Todd's reddit account.
---
Scrap box has become life...
---
which means its only about 1 more delay a way from being a Christmas 2020 release.
---
God help us if a huge bug is found that week.
---
Actually, make that any week, but you get the joke.
---
I got 2 large gifts and 3 small gifts in my junk box this morning!
---
I think they're not gonna be as in depth as people are anticipating or hoping for, it's Bethesda just don't go In to it with high expectations.
---
It's Christmas. You are welcome. It makes sense to be generous and leave it unlocked! Last thing I feel like doing is going Scrooge on some free items which exist only in a videogame. 
---
Check the vending machines while you are visiting and have some free whiskey from the punchbowl too.
---
I don't run it as well, but I definitely would smile more if they removed it. It's annoying as a sniper or gunner to be calculating everything the player is doing, and then all of a sudden they get a sharp jump upwards into the air before realizing "Oh right, Frog Legs" and gotta recalculate once more.
---
ALL I ASK IS THE ABILITY TO RE-ACQUIRE MISTRESS OF MYSTERY GEAR.
---
Sorry for the caps - it's not shouting, more like crying in agony.
---
Lost my sword early on when there was a server crash, and you can't make new ones. If you lose it, it's gone forever.
---
So the moral of the story is...if you‚Äôve got $12 you‚Äôve 30 days to hoard, pillage and plunder as much junk as you can without losing your marriage or job lmao then you‚Äôve at least got a couple cool skins you get to keep even after cancelling and a huge stash of resources to fall back on
---
If we could apply a dye to the Santa beard, I‚Äôd buy it in a second...
---
Please and Thank you
---
Well, BGS have said in the past that their monetisation changes have been due to community demand. I'd suggest using, different figures of speech
---
I haven't used my power armor in six months, maybe. When you play long enough and try perks you realise you can do better with regular armor and good legendary effects. My trapper, in fact, has like 200 rad resistance before meds.
---
I need those plans, do you remember which specific plan gives you the keypad lock?
---
I see this post is a few weeks old and you might have found a solution but what we do is whoever isn‚Äôt able to get in needs to fast travel outside of the vault and 90% of the time the door is open for them when they enter again. Otherwise everyone will go outside and we migrate hosts and that also works sometimes
---
Turrets. Rocket kind. Lots of them.
---
Some perks are so good, it pays to have dif. Sets.
---
Powered doors. 1 of the whitespring vendors will have it
---
You on PS4?
---
Just go into #fallout76 it's mostly people posting screenshots and enjoying the game
---
Great job! I gave up on reading the terminal articles a long time ago so this helped quite a bit
---
Be aware that 'very requested feature' makes Bethesda droll while thinking about how to monetize it.
---
Id be shocked if it isn't a Fallout 1st Exclusive feature.
---
People who lock it are the same who lock their purifiers. God forbid someone could take some of their neverending free items.
---
only a fool would buy guns/armor for this or any game with real money. the 1 and only legacy i have was given to me by some guy who felt bad after looking at my weapons during a trade because i had some really shit weapons
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot more griefer souchebags since the Halloween event ended...I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre just bored, waiting on Wastelanders, blah blah blah. If you‚Äôre bored, go play another game till February, quit being assholes out of boredom. I ran into one at a random camp near WS station a couple weeks ago that was using people‚Äôs electrically charged mutation to instigate an unwanted PVP, he two shot me twice with what I‚Äôm assuming is an obvious bloody build before I realized how he was even touching me. After 20 solid minutes of 5 of us following him and Robot Dance Trolling him he gave us a thumbs down and the poor lad server jumped.
---
How did you post an image?
---
Just create a new character. Or buy the items. I have like 7 voices of set.
---
Ah thanks. I am pretty new to twitter, forgot about hashtags lol.
---
Nah, I enjoy my Fallout 1st...if that‚Äôs the only way we get it, I guess I‚Äôm just the synth they‚Äôre looking for, don‚Äôt even care
---
Awesome, good idea, thanks
---
Id pay for a sword, but that's easier said than done.
---
I want a perk card scrip system...for other perk cards
---
I have four character with four builds. I haven't got legacy weapons, but tons of godrolls. 
---
Technically speaking, Unstoppable Monster, vampire faster swing +1 combat knife, bloodied faster fire reduced weight lever action, bloodied explosive reduced weight 50 Cal... And many more.
---
I‚Äôm an explosive rifleman build and I carry (TSE) Handmade and back it up with a Lever Action as my heavy hitter...not much I struggle with
---
If you get the tesla plans you can craft it and scrap it to get mods. That's what I did to get the auto receiver.
---
X Box.
---
I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs running something like unyielding sentinel armor or something high end like that...
---
There is no NCR armor in Fallout 76. That's Charleston Police Department armor.
---
I ran into a similar situation with a stealthed mirelurk.  I figured it was just a bugged spawn.
---
Any scout mask is crazy rare now, I‚Äôve had the urban forever and I had to drop like 7k for my forest scout a month ago
---
Or...orrrrrr....a very small Throat Slicer that does more damage than my TSE handmade lol
---
I can‚Äôt find mine either
---
Sorry, off the subject question but if you Lee your fusion generator in a separate walled off room, how do you connect power to your vendors?
---
I hope so, it'd be sweet
---
Or anyone who has played anything better or just doesn‚Äôt like garbage.
---
You connect the power thru a windowed wall and then change it to just a wall.
---
What you just described has become my normal activity basically since the Halloween event, buying, selling and trading is all I do anymore...but it‚Äôs still fun and useful knowing that I‚Äôm improving my stats and stockpiling resources and supplies in anticipation of Wastelanders.
---
No, what I said was correct.
---
Nobody cares if you think its bad if you can't provide a single reason as to why it is.
---
Actually got 4 small gifts from it in one hour today. It's random as far as I can tell.
---
My heart brakes for you on that, that hurts just as bad every time it happens. My sincere condolences.
---
If they want caps to have value, they need something that players will buy for caps to remove them from the game. Right now, you can get 1400 from the vendors every day, but there's nothing to do with them except trade them with other players. This means the supply of caps is always increasing. The Christmas wrapping paper is doing more for inflation than anything they've ever done. 
---
Maybe sell hideously expensive legendary modules to tweak 1 and 2 star gear to 3 stars. You can tune the prices via the weekly updates to hold the supply of caps steady. Something like this.
---
Many rare plans most of the taxadermy you can see in the build menu. For instance, pretty easy to get the plasma grenade plans
---
I think that should be a feature but can‚Äôt you just snap a photo with your phone of everything in your photo gallery? I do it all the time.
---
Or when the map tells you they have 250 plans and you spend 28 caps to get there only to find out they have 25 of 10 plans...
---
Jelly
---
And what is the deal with Vertibird food?!
---
No. It's not. The new player just will have a few NPC.
---
Have you even tried other games? What on Earth ever led you to expect NW to be good?
---
With my camp being fairly close to Vault 76 at Marigold, I always keep low level handmades and fixers in my machines for no more than 500 caps and they sell regularly...I foresee that being a pretty solid income after Christmas leading into Wastelanders
---
They are collecting all Technical Data im sure Plans and Schematics are a part of their archives. Could have you do "research" into the archives and discover a random plan or you could select a specific plan you wanted and you would have to devote a certain amount of server time to "research" it. Make the requirements high and it would equal out being able to choose a plan.
---
Be upset is not a opinion.
---
It does come with the beard.
---
Thank you!!! I‚Äôm buying it now.
---
Decent legendary armor and rad shield should be enough if you‚Äôre perked right
---
No problem :)
---
Honestly, everyone bitches about Bethesda but their support isn‚Äôt awful, the live chat is really helpful and I‚Äôve always had my issues taken care of quickly, even refunds on atoms and such
---
Yeah, once you find one, you can follow their likes. There's a pretty active community of fallout 76 players on there.
---
I encountered hostile bots last time I was in Watoga, but it was probably just payback for doing the bulk of my "kill robots with...." Possum badge activities there recently.... üòÅ
---
I just started a few days ago and unlike other online RPG's I've noticed high levels are nice to low levels and don't grief them like in GTA Online. One guy sold me a bunch of materials at a quarter of the value. and high levels just drop loot for me tbh I've gotten so much free stuff I haven't needed to grind all that much.
---
Yes, Ive played Fortnite, PUBG, COD Blackout, Apex Legends, Battlefield V, Vigor and Minecraft Hunger Games if you wanna count that.
---
Fortnite...well is Fortnite, PUBG is meh, Blackout is PUBG but slightly better, Apex Legends is really good, Battlefield V's is not bad but gives no incentive to play more, Vigor is pretty good but starts feeling like a mobile game where you are only coming back for daily rewards and Minecraft Hunger games is alright i guess but really no reason to play unless if that is 100% your jam.
---
I enjoy NW because although janky it has two fun maps, I enjoy the building, I enjoy how wacky and outlandish it is. Yes it has a major problem aka the one I made the post about and frog legs, which frog legs doesn't bother me too much as I'm quite good at aiming and whatnot but I definitely understand the issue there. But NW has a fun set of weapons and the rewards are worthwhile for those that play adventure mode and even the story behind NW is surprisingly really good and intricate. Its a shame you have to get to level 100 to experience it all without YouTube but its still really good.
---
NW has proper potential, it's Fallout. Who doesn't love Fallout? Its a Battle Royale in my second favourite game franchise. I could be a little biased but I have a blast playing it because I just absolutely decimate every player/squad I come across until I'm in the later circles, then I usually get clapped. I love how you earn XP for Adventure mode, not super useful to people with near perfect builds but perfect for those who are leveling up and need a break from PVE. 
---
A part of what makes NW good is because its apart of another game. You level up in NW and get some really nice cosmetics and workshop pieces.
---
They really missed an opportunity for a limited Cryptid holiday quest hunting Krampus...couldn‚Äôt be too hard to re-skin a Sheepsquatch
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but I also really miss 4 shotting a SB with my TSE‚Äôs pre-nerf lol
---
Just give us Armor stands from FO4 already....we all want to fed our wardrobes
---
Bold prediction: I'll be surprised if it comes before June.
---
I always assumed we would be able to host a game from our own machines.
---
I‚Äôve been turning it lately about 2 dozen each day. I just hop servers and it registers every time I log back in. My other guy has to find one in the world before it activates.
---
I wouldn't get my hopes for anything more than a minor update.
---
I want that beard but the ability to dye it...our beard selection blows
---
Awe sorry I‚Äôm on PC x
---
Whaaaat? Really? How have I not heard this till now...
---
Your complaining rivals that of a middle aged white women at target
---
Wow. They got no life
---
I have only ever been able to deposit one per event trigger,  which,  to me anyway,  seems be the acquisition of the first new set of Technical Data in a given session. 
---
I once spent a bunch of time running back and forth between the Whitespring bunker and the dropbox because I had found several in quick succession (I only picked up the first one and left the others where they were), and it triggered every time I picked up a new one if I had deposited the previous one.  Another time, in a similar situation,  I tried to nab them all to make just one run to the dropbox,  but it acted like I only had one, despite having 6 of them.  The next time I logged in and found a new one, though, it triggered the event again.
---
Those hack and lockpicking cards should be passives.  Not taking space in the special tree.
---
TSE Lever from the first Hermit Crab I ever encountered...pre-nerf it would melt anything in the game
---
Most people don't even know that you can lock the Santatron.
---
ps4? if so yea I've seen him pretty cool guy
---
Strange had a similar thing happen but with a scorched and in reverse. A scorched just popped up outta thin air in front of me wearing a Mrs. Claus outfit once it started moving the costume disappeared and it attacked me bare handed while nude.
---
Nice job
---
Should I type up a well thought out reply on why Fallout isn't Fallout, or should I add to the already burning fire? Wait, mod support hasn't been mentioned yet. That's a highly requested feature. Private Servers should allow mods, but the ATX Shop, and abusing mental illnesses is more important than customer satisfaction. I have Buyer's Remorse from 76 due to how it's being handled. Please, don't tempt me.
---
Conduits, my man.
---
Bah
---
PC
---
Yea I feel like I get it pretty good at this point! Lol
---
I think that is because this is a RPG. All people saying RPG is all about NPC or story... No. RPG is too about stats and perks. That's the difference between this and others battle royale games. You can't have different games with exactly the same mechanics, it makes no sense.
---
And to top it off the fungus wasn't specifically used on the ultracite mutated bats, they just happened to in the place where the Enclave tested their bio-weapons. When Eckhart saw the potential of them he had the locked away in an old AMS mining facility, Glassed Caverns. In an effort to raise the def-con and get control of the nukes he released not only the scorchbeast but the mutants at west-tek and the liberators at Mama Dolces.  
---
Eckhart was a mad man.
---
Yeah the queen claw looks very ‚ÄúGhoul‚Äù üòâ
---
Sulpher fountain?
---
I think the rules depend slightly on your situation. If you haven‚Äôt already got a decent weapon a 2*star one will work fine. Increases your chances of getting a good combo on a fixer, sledge, pistol whatever. 
---
Once you have some decent stuff, thenstart going 3 star to improve, either through luck or trades.
---
Never heard that before.  I'd ask a crafter... maybe just pay one to do the mod for you?  Might be cheaper?
---
Under the gazebo nearest the tennis courts in Whitrsprings golf course.

I saw a Blade of Bastet for sale yesterday in someone's vendor for 700 caps.  Sometimes, if you post here you can find someone who wants to get rid of the stash space, and isn't using the MoM gear.
---
Perks
---
I guess I can do that. Is there a way to make sure the person doesn‚Äôt steal my armpit pieces?
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say this guy probably got this via Non-legit means but if it is real holy shit that‚Äôs a 24/7 grind and good on him!.
---
The real issue here is frog legs. Should just be mutation or taken out. It‚Äôs just too good of a mobility buff that only specific builds benefit.
---
I'm starting to get afraid of pressing any button.
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
You mean there‚Äôs Fallout 1st and there‚Äôll be Fallout 1st Exclusive?
---
Fucking Raiders.  Happy Holidays.  Leave the noobs alone though.
---
Also stash all addictol so you don't accidentally use it and save it because you'll need to reset you addictions if you accidentally get addicted to something that messes up your build.
---
 LOL. Just join the Enclave and get the plans for free.
---
I found one attacking the santatron at my camp!
---
In the past I'd agree with you without any doubt, but since we had a couple of double XP events running for a while... I don't know, but for me looks "possible" to get all that experience legitimately
---
This is the real problem, half the adventure mode players use bloodied melee so when you realise that melee in NW is basically useless you are stuck with 
---
1: the base damage of all weapons (because melee builds usually have only 3 perception )
---
2: destroying your one swing Scorchedbeast build just to have a chanse to win 
---
PS: the reason I'm not ranting about fog legs because I have 9 agility for adrenaline and action boy.
---
Yup!
---
The problem here is you wanna be "optimized". That's not the goal. You can have fun and "win" in both modes with a original build. But no... You need use you meta build, farming without having fun and use the exact same build that everyone in NW.
---
Screw those guys. Diseased deep mirelurk kings can cloak. I've seen it a few times now. Like the ultimate worst.
---
Where do you get them?
---
The guys obviously going for the explore Appalachia  7600 hours challenge.
---
Coming to an atom shop near you 2020....Legendary Scrip Kits lol I‚Äôd buy them tbh sorry everybody, you‚Äôre welcome Bethesda
---
Dual wielding would be awesome
---
Don't you know, were all invited to beta test it!
---
What an honor!
---
Confirmed for eventually
---
I mean I have a level 70, a 268 and a 15.  I took a break February until mid-June.  I never used an exploit and I have not really focused on Hardcore XP grinding.   I can believe someone legit being there if they put a lot of their free time into it.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs not even aggravating, that‚Äôs impressive...I‚Äôd probably stand up and clap at that server crash
---
The closest thing you can do is get the aluminum trees an craft the green one with ornaments on it. I don't think Bethesda will ever give us the good one that's in the survival tent.
---
Holy shit. Thanks for this. Gonna do this while at work. Wow
---
Don't! That plan is worth so much it's nuts! Also I snagged one finally.
---
The Bomber Jacket...I just wish we could change or find different ranks
---
That's what i'm afraid for :P
---
That also happened to me on two separate occasions this evening.
---
Very much agree, I‚Äôve got WAY more than my money‚Äôs worth since Beta and that includes suffering through the the dark ages
---
I think thats a great idea! If Wastelanders is the ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù like its hyped up to be, having YouTubers like Many A True Nerd and JuiceHead play the DLC beforehand and talk about the experience could definitely bring some new players and old ones back to the game!
---
From what I can remember F4 did very well and they can let us host our own servers, from our own machines. Many game lets you host. So fix the game good, sale goes up and let us host, cost goes down.
---

This mod is quite old but maybe it still works.
---
Is the recipe RNG or can I do something specific to earn it?
---
That sounds like a good strategy! Here, take my upvote ;)
---
My biggest wish
---
Man that bug may have been the single thing that saved the game in the first couple months lol
---
They mean it's gonna be available to 1st subscribers only like other QoL things (scrapbox, tent), I guess.
---
Wish this was a feature. Even if we had to save/copy a .ini file somewhere else or something for safe keeping.
---
Agreed...I think I had PTSD after that patch and the TSE Nerfpocalypse patch
---
I have the plan for it, but you need the blade to craft it ü§îü§îü§î
---
its slowly unlocking. Each day at 7pm et. 
---
So, there should be 3 unlocked so far
---
Not the dress/female version. Only the "Mr. Claus" suit version.
---
If you will use psycho/psychobuff before fights, those are great drugs to get addicted to. Otherwise, DON'T USE THEM. Their withdrawal sucks, you get -str for buffout and I think -str and -10dr for psycho. X-cell is also a bad one, you lose I think 1 in all special. Alcohol is one you definitely should consider, since it comes up so often in challenges and you can just chug it for thirst
---
The fun part about a junkie's build is once you're addicted to something you can use it as much as you want with no worries
---
Oh ok i forgot about that. Yea they should have like skill slots where you can have up to ig four specials. Like a quick select system. Now i will say this because if i dont they may add something like this to the atomic shop. If they were to make this feature then they should implement it in base game without any purchases and you unlock this feature at level 50. Just saying.
---
You use a person with high karma to make it safer
---
Back in my day a TSE Gauss Rifle did 1400 damage and a single Bobby pin weighed as much as a Nuka Cola
---
Ok thank you. I guess I‚Äôll give it a later. It just kicked me off the server for maintenance.
---
Wait, does the queen claw not drop?
---
A terminal in the bunker. Now a Calibrated Shocks plan from them is 5460 with 3 Good Deal.
---
No üòî
---
You said for free. I know the plan is in the bunker. That‚Äôs the one I was talking about. For me it‚Äôs was in the mid to high 6000 range of caps. Maybe if I gighten my charisma it will be in the 5,000s
---
Maybe it‚Äôs been a hellishly shitty year for the guy, and 76 is the only thing that keeps him grounded. Or he‚Äôs hacking. It‚Äôs PC so that‚Äôs probably the case.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll be in the big Wastelanders update. They‚Äôve said they delayed the release to add a bunch of requested improvements, I‚Äôm betting loadouts are one of them
---
He chose revenge and he must be a bloodied build with an insanely powerful bloodied handmade...I refuse to fight back, just sit there and let them waste their time and ammo...they‚Äôll get bored and leave, then follow them around the map and spam Mothman/Robot dance them till they server hop. That‚Äôs my go-to at least lol

Weird, thought I deleted that reply

Be a lad and just put them in a vendor machine for free
---
Hey man I own a faction what do you need?
---
Basically all we need is AP and it will work like a rifle. I'd say they will have to rebalance all the guns in game, if they want to make things more balanced.
---
Pistols: AP, Higher damage, lower range, lowest AP cost in VATS
---
Single Shot only rifles: Higher Damage, lower ap cost in VATS, higher fire rate.
---
Commando-able rifles: proper magazines
---
Heavy Weapons: Increase ammo crafting cost for .50 bullets
---
Explosives: Increase initial falloff range for AOE damage, much higher damage, lower damage to weapons
---
Shotguns: Slightly higher range with a much higher initial fallout range. AP for shotguns other than combat shotguns.
---
Being a solo player, my charisma is spec‚Äôd at 3 lmao so I‚Äôll be taking all the drugs
---
Are you sure. I pretty certain it was datamined as a reward
---
Fuck them.

I‚Äôm glad people like it now. It used not be this way with cosmetics. There were a couple of skin bundles that were limited time tied to the games anniversary and people were livid
---
Graham should 100% be walking around in a Santa suit with Chally in reindeer antlers
---
Yes and no. Seems to be feast or famine. One run today at Camden yielded like 4-5 (it was unbelievable). Lots of other runs only 1 or none.
---
Honestly, whoever is incharge of creative decisions of the atomic shop, like what will be made and the sold. Needs to be fired.
---
Give me the ingame asset of the Christmas tree you find at whitespring/morgantown/Charleston capital building for like 150-200 atoms and I promise you would sell SO much more than those shitty, overpriced, unnecessarily bundled (multiple colours and designs. Who cares. I just need 1 and I don't want it to look like trash), ugly Aluminium Trees
---
Please allow it to sync with Bnet character challenges!

It was so stressful and confusing when I went to it early level that I have yet to return to it even though I‚Äôm Lvl 115 lol

I'm opening 1000 Large Handcrafted Gifts tomorrow so I guess I'll see then.
---
I love that he said **you're** the rude one! I mean, c'mon.
---
For those of us that are sitting on stacks of tech data, is there a way to sell it?  In the past, I would hand one at a time to a person so they could turn them in.  But I heard something changed.
---
Thanks for reminding me that it‚Äôs another scorched nest to farm!
---
Yes, they will have to rebalance a lot of the other weapons (ESPECIALLY EXPLOSIVES), but this is a topic mainly about gunslingers and their problems. We can do another thread on each weapon tier and how they can fix it. 
---
Also, No, they don't need lower range. Jesus, no one on here ever looked at a revolver and said to themselves "You know what this needs? LOWER RANGE".
---
Have you played Encryptid? Lol I‚Äôm pretty OP and I get owned constantly during that event...I mean, I agree that the game overall should be more difficult but my Lord, they were cruel making that event
---
Do you mean that once you build your own Workshop you can kill your own santatron and the gifts are in a loot?
---
Sounds like you need to join the Bush Wookies. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
also kinda sounds like that guy might be a cheater
---
Bush Wookies?
---
If you are changing only pistols, yes not lower range, but an overall balance for all weapons needs it. It is because the overall balance is supposed to give each weapon their characteristics instead of merely buffing them.
---
My TSE handmade breaks really slow at 200% repair, even my TSE lever which is fragile as shit breaks pretty slow with the max gunsmith repair
---
Oh my god. I am so stupid. I read that message out of context. And no , three pieces is a good start!! You can get all uny cav to make a nice set and make you stronger! My apologies
---
I have always played a full health build, the idea of being one shot by 75% of the map at any given time stresses me out way to much...and I‚Äôve been running explosive rifle build since before the TSE nerf. I agree it‚Äôs still viable. No, it‚Äôs not nearly as OP as it once was but I don‚Äôt struggle much on anything, other than SB‚Äôs sponging the hell out of explosion damage
---
No, that seems to be it. Sort of disappointed I can't get the tree in the 1st tent as a camp item, for real. 
---
That said, I had fun decorating the giant tree. It's in my front yard.   [https://i.imgur.com/4NV0Wjh.png](https://i.imgur.com/4NV0Wjh.png)
---
People that hide in bushes the whole match
---
I was just saying I haven't, because that's the thing most people don't really crash too often or at all
---
More like Bethesda please don't forget to put your shitty game on Steam and get overwhelmingly bad response.
---
I mean no offense but that sounds really not fun.
---
Wear camo and hide in a bush. I make it to 2nd most of the time, and often only get spotted in the final circle. I'm on satellite so I can't really kill anyone unless they're super not paying attention, as my latency is enough so I can shoot someone 3-4 times and it doesn't even register until the 5th hit.
---
Probably used the "prison trap" XP exploit that was in early game.
---
Actually it's quite fun if your team talks, and it gives high exp because you'd live longer by avoiding fights. 
---
You might also get a thrilling fight in the very small circle if you live till the end.
---
Play the smart if you cannot beat your enemies.
---
Correct. Technically it is CPD Ranger Armor.
---
I'm glad you asked, I want that beard, too!
---
True that, I‚Äôm level 115 with 3* BOS combat armor...went to a camp that was built above and into that tunnel, then got swarmed by a few ghouls and got wasted quick inside that little space
---
What build is optimal for bush wookies? I don‚Äôt have any friends I can play with on PS4 so communicating is out of the picture. Most of the players who are using mics are high level players and go off and do their own thing.
---
They should call it bitch legs instead.  Fight me on the ground like where you ought to be.
---
Sometimes when it bugs out you have to drop the data and find new data. You can only do one, and it triggers when you pick up a new one, so even if you have a bunch they're pretty much worthless.
---
Never liked frog legs. If you don‚Äôt have it your pretty much guaranteed to get your ass whooped by a whole squad running frog legs.
---
I burned through 10 minutes and probably over 100 5.56 killing one from on top of WS station storage shed...got it down to one last shot and some random player comes in with their damn Plasma Gatling and vaporized the F‚Äôn thing. Glad I had my mic turned off lol. I then wasted another 10 minutes looking for the tiny green pile only to find it on the far side of the station roof, nowhere near where it was flying when he vaporized it
---
Yea pretty much.  I refuse to put it on makes it more challenging.  Almost to 100 anyway so wont be doing nw after that.  Just want the unlocks.
---
Fallout 4 has mostly positive reviews. IMO Fallout 76 is better than 4 and should become much better than 4 in Wastelanders.
---
Responders are 100% more charming and worthy than the Minutemen...everyone loves Freestates (who are pretty awesome, I‚Äôll admit) but I really think the Responders are in my top 3 factions in all of Fallout now
---
Micro transactions were to be only aesthetic, remember?
---
Now everything that should be part of the game will be part of the subscription... cause thats not a microtransaction... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My GT is DRSTEVENSTRANGE , if you want to add me, feel free...I‚Äôll always have some free stimpacks, water and food for you if you need it. My camp is above Pt Pleasant (Marigold Pavilion) so you can easily handle the terrain.
---
Fallout 76 being better than 4 is the biggest joke I have seen around here lmao.
---
Fallout 76 might get bad reviews on Steam not because it's that bad, it's fine, but there a lot of haters and the game doesn't live up to a 3A title standard currently.
---
I want to have fun on nuclear winter, I really do but frog legs destroys the balance as if you don‚Äôt have 9 agility or whatever your screwed. You either camp which is not fun or get screwed over and die. Seriously the amount of times I‚Äôve been screwed over by players with frog legs has to number in the hundreds. Some of the most useless perk cards are the CQC ones like melee and shotguns because how the hell are you supposed to shoot or get close enough to someone constantly spamming jump and jumping 10 feet in the air while ass blasting you with bullets?
---
Any build can do lmao.
---
Maybe Pharma Farma so you get more stims to live through situations
---
A basic hunting rifle, perked early and modded as you can will get you through level 20...It got me through a lot lol
---
Okay thanks fir the advice
---
Only 1500 atoms per speech check
---
I've never heard of a chameleon super mutant, but who knows, could be a bug. 
---
Occasionally the robots will spawn agro, normally after killing a bunch of regular ones. I don't know what the requirement there is, though.
---
I do everything but beg newbies to take my gifts I drop every time I see one...they always just run the opposite direction
---
They really need to give more than a 20atom reward for that
---
I attempt it but they always haul ass in the opposite direction lol
---
Fallout 76 is mainly about exploration, especially early on. Yeah, the main quest is there, but honestly once it sends you out of the forest you should probably back burner it and try to explore the entire forest region. The MQ is going to send you to higher level areas, and you'll get trounced if you're not familiar with game mechanics. 
---
I second the event thing. If there's an event in the forest, do it. Also right now the Christmas even is on, so hit the airport a lot and get as many scorched as you can, as they can be legendary and have Gifts for the holiday. It's one of the best times of year for lower levels to more easily get legendary weapons and armor. And even if it's stuff you don't want you can scrip them at the machine at train stations. 
---
What do you mean by new mechanics? You've got an hour in and you're already looking for new mechanics? :p
---
I doubt that works on PS4, but thanks
---
I can agree it's nice being able to have free stuff
---
People have been begging for this for over a year.
---
At least make them weightless until theres a better system. I have about 300 lbs of plans in my stash.
---
I've found like 20 in the last half hour.
---
That icon is probably a realistic portrait of the guy ü§î
---
Can i only get the beard not the outfit? I‚Äôd love to sport a beard on a pirate costume.
---
I have a life outside of this game. I.e. wife and kids...when I find the time to play games I enjoy playing the game rather than fiddling with Menus...as someone with 100s of hours between MHW and Warframe..I just expected loadouts as standard in this type of game..
---
I could have Frog Legs. I just don't like them. I feel too vulnerable floating up there and everyone knowing where I'm landing.
---
Well that‚Äôs where you went wrong! You expected something out of this game! Everyone knows you shouldn‚Äôt do that!
---
(Also, you kinda just proved my point more but let‚Äôs just sweep that under the rug, okay?)
---
Suppressor mod on Voice of Seth would be great and lore friendly.
---
Yup, the trophy picture for the quest "Personal Matters" shows how she looks, and with that image it is easy to pick her out from the small group of people at the Vault 76 inauguration, and again later in the intro.
---
That's the truth. I have one character that's bloody melee in full zealots gear with harder to detect while sneaking. I  am literally immortal in any scorched zone, running around with 9% health and instant killing anything within reach.
---
The ItV said some of those newcomers weren't all friendly. Be careful
---
With my pistol alt hitting level 85 last night, I humbly disagree. I wanted something new to try and expected garbage, so was pleasantly surprised. They are not top tier, but not everthing needs to be. Damage is fine for most purposes, and decent legendary effects are cheap to buy as no one wants them. I carry a mix of AA and instigating .44 revolvers.
---
I'd guess Responders, but I anything that rocks your boat.
---
Sounds good. Follow follow follow
---
Hacking and modding that alters game mechanics will absolutely result in ban.
---
76 is generally a good experience if you have friends, it's even better on survival servers, sadly the game mode is gone due to drop in player numbers, partly due to not having a way to band unknown people together in game.
---
Private servers is kinda empty to me as those hold waay less people.
---
I don't agree with your logic but I commend your ability to admit your character faults lol that's the "1st" step ;)
---
The plans exist. I know this because, for reasons I won‚Äôt disclose, I combed through pretty much every ID in the game within the past week. Other interesting ones are the laser musket plan and Formula Q.
---
The problem for mutation is that you cannot reliably get them in NW.
---
I'd say make every mutation into perks instead.
---
I wanted to troll and say 'like your fianc√©' but I guess that's too much lmao.
---
Grats on the big heist though, welcome to Payday: Fallout.
---
Home defense trap glitch in the early days probably. Gain xp as fast as you can press a single button.
---
I know this isn‚Äôt gonna happen but I wish it would be another world and we could either create a new room there or transfer an existing one from the legacy world to it. In that way we could always play as we want and as the game was designed in the first place and when we beat the SBQ we could decide to move on.
---
Well that's why I just sell all my plans for 10 caps each. Only hard to get ones like the jetpack I price 930. I moved my camp near one of the most common airports new players usually go to (forget the name of it) and I'd start seeing people buying a ton of my plans lmao. It also holds up a ton of space too so some easy caps &amp; free up space.
---
Someone must have tried to PvP a Strangler Heart. Lol.
---
And why would you do that when it's super unreliable and mediocre and might get you killed.
---
That makes sense, it's not a good system but it does make sense within the context
---
Because Chameleon has won me many a fights.
---
Why do you need that when there are bushes.
---
Because Chameleon has won me more fights than bushes.
---
Just remember with Pharma Farmer you need to actively press a button to search for extra chems while having the container window open.
---
Bonus: Petrified corpses in NW gives you aid items and even quick drop turrents sometimes.
---
Bonus 2: Pop drugs like candy.
---
So wouldn't it be better if it's a perk?
---
A few pieces of armor with poison resist works fine
---
WickedChickedy has a lot of good tadpole and possum guide videoe on youtube üëç
---
\&gt;  Bigger map but empty.
---
Playing since BETA but still not fully explored even the Forest. So the words about empty map looks like nonsense for me. (Playing not every day but nevertheless.)
---
\&gt;  More locations but less story behind them.
---
I have quite the opposite feelings. E. g. in Flatwoods you have a holotape with story details in almost every house. Every location I visited had some interesting things to explore.
---
\&gt;  Building is not better or even worse 
---
In Fallout 4 building is restricted only to settlements. 
---
\&gt;  I have no idea what combat improvement have you seen 
---
These things e. g.: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2CBMPyHAJtkxECtTS9rtBr/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-upcoming-combat-improvements](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2CBMPyHAJtkxECtTS9rtBr/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-upcoming-combat-improvements)
---
\&gt;  Perk system is worse because QOL and crafting perks are not constant 
---
It's sad that game still don't have perk loadouts. But I don't think that crafting perks should be constant.
---
\&gt;  Complex crafting is just a mod away in Fallout 4 
---
Mods are often mess up the game lore so I usually not use them. Except bug fixes or interface mods.
---
Not really raiders if it is unlocked, the grinches that pick the locks, they are the raiders.
---
&gt; It's also not a viable option in my house.
---
Ethernet over power cabling?
---
(HomePlug).
---
Nope. Then more people would have it and it would become overused, just like the froglegs, which I think should NOT be a perk.
---
Or shut your vendors off so noone can see your camp and ft to it.
---
Record the data?
---
I love the beard, and the antlers. 
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/qEaLf8n.png](https://i.imgur.com/qEaLf8n.png)
---
Yeah it's a good workaround for an awful perk model.
---
Hmm, I've never got many blue screens constantly. But it definitely does lag a ton when I'm crafting stuff like food or ammo. I wonder if reducing stuff of copies of no weight like you said would resolve that issue. I do crash a lot but not as often like you described. Can you tell me if this helps reduce crafting lag?
---
Thank.
---
Thanks.
---
Prob won't read that much for a while, you got me. Gg
---
That's the bear arm. You can get plans from Project Paradise for it.
---
Yeah I had this on pc which I‚Äôm quite new to. Don‚Äôt have a great deal of decent legendaries at level 54 so I had no chance. 
---
Same thing happening except the guy was lock picking every resource gatherer. 
---
Now I have a bunch of large purifiers in my camp and easily collect enough in a play session to max out 1400 at the vendor meaning all my junk is either sold to players if worth something or scrapped for plans. This play session they weren‚Äôt refilling which I put down to a bug.
---
Every time I came back it was empty and I noticed my santa was too. Found a wanted guy by my camp looting the pier next door thought nothing of it (the one with the magazine spawn). Started crafting and every now and again I check my map in case the visitor is low level as I always give them a levelled 50 cal brotherhood recon and a set of leather or combat armour depending on level. 
---
Saw the same guy again and he‚Äôs going from water purifier to purifier and wanted. 
---
So I pulled out my two shot ultracite Gatling, next to no damage and he practically one shots me with what looks like a TSE harpoon. Then I respawned at camp and he one shots me again and again. 
---
Long story short someone visited my vendor and annihilated him DRESSED LIKE SANTA Thanks high level Santa dude hope you enjoyed the 10 free full fusion cores and massive bunch of soup I was selling and decided you could have them  all üòäüëåüèª
---
Was just gonna sat stims, auto stim and born survivor work fine even in Pvp.
---
I haven't encountered the bug really but if you'd just search around, apparently some people got a bug that causes Rosie to ignore them, so they are kinda stuck.
---
its not gonna happen that u get free Steam key if you own bethesda version..  
---
.. account migration gonna happen.  
---
..but ur not gonna get Steam key for free. U have to re-purchase and then link your account (same bethesda launcher still gonna open).
---
I think I'd rather have like 3 load out options.
---
I'd have 2 dedicated to builds
---
Maybe one pvp one pve PA or no PA
---
Then the 3rd I'd make for crafting, farming, and hacking/ lockpicking
---
But you get it, there could be many different options with this method
---
This method is basically what Warframe has
---
What's the point of the perk card system if you can swap them out instantly at any time? If you can have any perk you want at a moment notice then they may as well drop the entire pretense of character builds and just let you equip unlimited perks. The perk card system only has meaning if a perk loadout requires some sort of commitment. At the very least, you should only be able to change perks at your base. Something that negates a fundamental game mechanic is an exploit at best and straight up cheating at worst.
---
Without doing anything of the sort and without focusing of lvling - besides the first two month 'rush' - I have the following:
---
1 * 336
---
1 * 263
---
1 * 257
---
1 * 203
---
1 * 91
---
3 * 53
---
6 * 32
---
I can totally see that person reaching lvl 1000+ if he had slight more focus on lvling - grinding nuke zones for instance - and as opposed to myself focused on a single char rather than spreading 'sideways'.
---
Rather than doubt his means I praise his dedication. I don't think I would have made it this far if I had dedicated myself to a single character/account.
---
Despite having 1st I really hope they don‚Äôt put this or similar features behind a paywall. It would be a dick move 
---
I‚Äôll be honest the survival tent is hugely pay to win if I‚Äôm being realistic as it is
---
how would the tent be pay to win tho out of curiosity?
---
You have to hit level 50 to be able to move special points, not 70.
---
When you hit level 50 you can swap SPECIAL points to another section like Perception or Strength for example. Though I would add up what perks you want first, and then choose what SPECIAL points to transfer them into. 
---
https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/SPECIAL_Perk_Cards 
---
- here's a site with every perk in each SPECIAL category. Take a look &amp; wish you luck! 
---
(Scroll down to about half way to get to the s.p.e.c.i.a.l links to browse).
---
Here you have a matrix of perks by level, that you can print.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk-matrix/
---
Then you can circle your way down with a pencil.
---
Unfortunately there is no way to take into account the cards you get in packs so you will have to adapt a bit along the way.
---
Hearing this was enough to put a big smile on my face
---
I am using a bloodied build myself and unless I lag I'd always be in time to administer a stim, or if I need it, a super stim.
---
You'd only die if you are careless, and what's the fun in always knowing you will not lose when everything in the game except Raids don't really post a challenge.
---
There, you are just being selfish.
---
I seriously doubt making it 100 atoms would cause this obviously making it like 1000 atoms is out of the question serious goal or not u get more atoms for the robot challenges
---
Well thanks for remind me to check if mine is locked and guess what? it wasn't .. well .. great.. and i was wondering why i see no gifts in there.
---
Oh definitely. I'd love the whole load out idea. But if this never came to Fallout 76 that would be my second choice I'd want.  (I wish in warframe you could pick warframe loadouts too..)
---
For instance :
---
- level 2 : Action boy.
---
- level 3 : Scrounger
---
- level 4 : Lone Wanderer
---
- level 5 : Picklock
---
- level 6 : Nothing interesting for my build... pick a second level of Action Boy.
---
- ...etc
---
I hear you l but it's bad game design..to say they intended to make it this way and then defend it doesn't change the fact that me at level whatever hundred I am now..shouldn't need to go into my menu to switch a perk card around with another one, to then go back to game unlock the lvl 2 box..get that miniscule loot and then go back in my menu to re equip my previous perk..then go back to game to continue playing...that's bad design..it needs a change..
---
I found several posts, all being more than more than 9 months old and one guy who mistook the "Gain Rose's trust" quest for the one he needed to to do, when what the quest really tells yo to do is to finish her other quests first. So... a bug that was fixed a long, long time ago.
---
You can pick Warframe load outs tho .. you have 3 of them..
---
Yes but since you can do only one move at each level it takes some levels to get things right.
---
You can spawn anywhere repeatedly for free. Move it for free, there‚Äôs unlimited junk storage in it, your entire stash wherever you go a bed and instrument.
---
It‚Äôs spawn capabilities make you the most annoying griefer in the world As I found out recently as the guy kept spawning over and over in his tent outside my camp. Ended up logging into private world to get away from him as Bethesda kept putting me back in the same server!
---
It‚Äôs not just the scrap box either, go into a private world do powering up Poseidon and take the yard with no risks and farm an unlimited amount of fusion cores, this gets you to max caps pretty quick and your guaranteed to always have an hour to complete whereas in public worlds I always seem to get there with 6mins to spare. 
---
Maybe pay to win isn‚Äôt the right word but the QOL of first is immense. I justify it but using my immense stash capability for crafting brotherhood recons and full armour sets for under 50‚Äôs
---
I rent
---
I definitely recall seeing some more recent comments, not 9 months ago anyway lmao.
---
One time i had a guy come to my door trying to sell me steaks out the back of his truck i gave him a funny look he got mad and left kinda reminds me of this story
---
Must been a new thing recently? I know there are weapon loadouts. I havent been on warframe in a few months.
---
And there we are. We leave the actual arguments and go to *Argumentum Ad Hominem*. 
---
Bye!
---
Don't get too excited. Its very likely to be riddled with bugs, broken questlines and other nonsense
---
And there we are, someone gets called out and gets shamed and leaves.
---
Danggg that's some interesting points you're making here. I might actually try one month of 1st just to get that place and load up on cores while I simultaneously take the ammo facility .. honestly in public I don't even claim workshops anymore..I get too griefd by other players
---
Not for every1 some people like myself tend to keep op weapons in any game sometimes to kill stuff thats just getting in ur way when ur tryin to do somethin
---
This is why I reluctantly did it because of griefers
---
And it annoys me that the only way I can escape this is by paying for it üôÑ
---
But I‚Äôm too invested in the game now to scrap all my achievements üòÇüòÇ how sad that sounds upsets me.
---
for 150 - 200 it would not sell shit, you know why? You can make 150 atoms in 2 days if you want... that being said they wont sell a single one... 500 atoms is another story... good luck making a bit more then that everyweek, thats why you dont see alot below 500...
---
I use full health and cannot outstim a king with a vampire weapon somethins not right about that
---
As far as I remember you can have 3 Warframe load outs as well as 3 mod load outs on your frame and each piece of equipment.. trying to think if your weapons change when you change Warframe load out or is that only appearance..? I haven't played for a few months either...
---
Yes, I eat Bufftats like crazy when running heavy gunner PA.
---
If you do Poseidon yard, take the lead and the fusion nodes, hemlock for the x3 acid nodes, billings for the copper, the scrap yard for the black titanium and take the aluminium in the Poseidon yard also, then move to ammo factory and steel yard for the lead in the corner your laughing. 
---
Also if you take sunshine meadows after Poseidon power up the food factory for free and get non radiated sugar bombs for the AP benefits and free food. 
---
I basically levelled 20 levels in a flash doing this during double xp to get to 50 and basically be in the money for a long time yet
---
Hahaha trust me I feel you. I am really contemplating closing my Minecraft realm to reallocate those funds to this just so I don't have anyone trying to kill me and take all I have worked for...I think I would actually enjoy taking workshops again..
---
I realised I hadn‚Äôt used Netflix 4K for months so trashed that üòÇ
---
Nice one, That's a great strat! Definitely tempted to do that for a month and see how it goes. What happens to the stuff in your scrapbox when the one month runs up tho? Will I lose it?
---
Lots of people are reporting very frequent crashes. How frequent varies between person to person, but it‚Äôs a fact that crashes are happening very often now.
---
No it stays in there but you can‚Äôt add to it so it may be worth doing it loading it up for a month and using it. 
---
Plus the ranger helmet looks good on camp combat armour üòÖ
---
We're the testers.
---
That's not how you tell people they are doing something. You tell them how to improve.  This is how you do it.
---
As long as players cant kill the companions like they can with the cows in your camp.
---
If you do win the lottery, buy Bethesda Austin pls xD
---
Is this on pc? Because I've never encountered this bug even once.
---
That's cool, so theoretically I can get it for a month..grind everything I need and then when the month runs up..I'll have a bunch of resources I can live off of..I'll still be able to take anything I put in the unlimited box out, I just won't be able to add anything else in...am I understanding correctly?
---
I've posted this on the trade sub last week, put your name and platform on the list!
---
This has happened to me, but only when joining another player.
---
Private w friends is great, its popular to hate but honestly its a really good game.. the map is llllloaded with neat things
---
I bought everything I own off e-bay.
---
I agree. I like verticality of maps like morgantown but totally don't like to fight bunnies,even if i can hop myself.
---
Sorry that I don't want it to be public?
---
&gt;Forest
---
Just look up any fully unlocked map, and you will see the Forest is rather empty when compared to other parts. They made the map empty so it could hold players' camps, but definitely not an improvement if you get to have more fun locations.
---
&gt;Holotapes
---
That's because there is no fucking npc, they can only use holotapes, if that's gone there will be no story. Besides of compensating the lack of npcs there isn't more story.
---
&gt;Building
---
Oh yeah and enjoy a smaller building area, camp budget, and more other limitations. Definitely a huge tradeoff for that little bit of freedom.
---
&gt;Perks
---
Switching perk cards for crafting/barter/QOL is a constant thing that players would be doing, it is such a redundancy that affects gameplay and it can be avoided entirely, but they went with it. Bad design.
---
&gt;Crafting 
---
What I am saying is that does not make a big difference in terms of overall game quality. More food item buffs are nice though.
---
&gt;Combat Tweaks
---
Ah so these minor tweaks, and I thought it's something as revolutionary as that from Fallout NV to Fallout 4. 
---
One big melee bug just fucks it all up. I mean how could these make up for not properly registering damage? If they fix the melee bug then yes there could be minor improvements overall.
---
&gt;Overall
---
You can say 76 is a better game with all the minor improvements added up and all else equal to 4 but the major flaws in 76 makes the overall experience worse.
---
Did you even read what I wrote? Scroll up to my initial comment.
---
There were no NPCs a year ago. Everyone was dead. If suddenly a new player leaves the vault and sees NPCs while following the main story that is not consistent with the original narrative. How can you tell me that‚Äôs not the case?
---
[this is the fallout 76 website](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)
---
I think this would work with a slower swing speed but with a knock back effect that would counter it.
---
Weapon Bobbles are worth 200 caps?
---
Other stuff like Lockpicking are boarderline worthless. 
---
Some junk is valuable. Lead, Ballistic Fiber. 
---
Ultracite, May become valuable for the next 1-2 months then back to less so. Nuclear material? Not sure it ever was.
---
Not a Supermutant. It's a Nightkin.
---
How the hell would mods even work on a multiplayer game, private servers kinda defeat the purpose of what this game is, it‚Äôs not mental illness abuse it‚Äôs basic business strats either grind in game or grind in real life for the OPTIONAL cosmetics. Buyers remorse is for home owners not videos games. Stick to fo4 and wait for fo5 Karen 76 is too much for you.
---
I'd prefer a mirelurk queen scythe or a nuka fist myself
---
How much does Ballistic Fiber usually go for? And why is Ultracite maybe going to be valuable for the next 1 to 2 months?
---
Yeah, it's that when you first go to fallout.com and then hit fallout 76, for whatever reason the link always works on reddit but not my browser
---
Sometimes I get fucked by a king when I lag, but otherwise it's really fine. 
---
Idk what's the problem, maybe due to damage mitigation effects. I usually run PA with emergency protocol when fighting the SBQ, which is usually the only time I encounter a king, I also have dodgy but I really don't know does that help.
---
Or maybe I usually kill everything before they reach me or have a chance to attack me.
---
I just went to it in my mobile browser (safari)
---
Yes. And all that adventure happens in about a day only. You're reading all wrong. You just need imagination. It's incredible the amount of people who don't understand that.
---
I charge rock bottom for every thing. at end game you will find you generate far more items than you can hold and vendor. even charging rock bottom I still have to throw many valuables away. all plans maps and explosives are gifts to customers who visit my shop. 
---
vendor 1 is legendary weapons and armor. I sell them at whatever they show up as when I put them on the vendor. 
---
I have my end game weapon so scrip is not a concern. if scrip was a concern I would use vendor 1 to sell my plans and tmaps and just scrip all my stuff. 
---
Vendor 2 is food and chems. I sell them mostly to help customers and only get a little profit. all chems and food are 5 per except for super stims which go for 10 per. 
---
Vendor three is all mutation serums. I sell them for 399 and they are my primary money maker. I keep at least 1 or 2 of each type on there and I only keep serums on it so its easier to know what I need to make. I make many extra serums and sell those on my alts to npc vendors daily. I get vendor cap max on every character in under 30 minutes at this point. 
---
Vendor 4 is my ammo vendor - all ammos sells at 1 per. I throw away all explosives. they dont move fast enough and are heavy. when I get an abundance of lead I use it to make 5.56 the current flavor of the month is commando builds with handmades so 5.56 sells out as fast as I can make it second and third most ammo types seem to be .308 and .45
---
I use fusion cores for myself and dont sell them as a rule but I sell plasma cores for 25c per full core. I dont make them and sell the ones I loot. I currently have 60 total. 
---
my vendor may go a day or two without selling a thing then one guy will come and buy a lot. those plasma cores for example. whoever shows up and needs cores will just buy all of them most likely. 
---
magazines and bobbleheads i sell at 5 per now as well thats far below market value but space is my issue far more than caps i need that stuff gone as soon as I post it.
---
Same lol, once you understand how things work, Bloodied builds are still meta imo.
---
I use duckduckgo. Also doesn't work in chrome either
---
1. Acid, Steel, Lead - People allways wants this. So this is great for 1 for 1 if you have plenty of it.
---
-
---
2. A Legacy weapon is a legacy weapon wether it has good effects or not. The least those go is for 15k caps, so evaluate your weapons and price accordanly.
---
3. 5.56 - This is your second cureency, allways stock up on it. Most of the time high end deals go for max caps + 30k 5.56.
---
4. People are always looking for Fixers and Bear Arms, both the plans and the legendary 'versions of these weapons, regardless of their effects. You'll allways fetch a nice price, so keep that in mind.
---
5. Lastly aid items arent rlly popular unless you sell them in a huge bundle. People are hard pressed for caps as it is, so the deal needs to be worth it.
---
Thanks for this info. I really appreciate it.
---
The vendor only lasts while you're in game, right? So, if I want to sell something, I need to be online to do it, right? And, of course, hope someone joins my server also.
---
BF is just in demand. I never sell it or look for it, just hope round the Player vendors and take a guesstimate. 
---
Ref -Ultracite. With the current event on the Plane for Ultracite Gatling Lasers (A Very good NRG Hvy weapon)  are becoming notably more common (Was a very rare drop from Census Violence) and crafting/scraping mundane UGL‚Äôs is the only way to get 11 of the 14 mods. Most UGL‚Äôs in game drop as legendaries so cant be scrapped for mods. 
---
Each UGL takes 18 Ultracite to craft. And while you can get ore from Fissure sites it‚Äôs a craft rate of 5/2
---
Then why respond other to say "I know something you don't know". Seems like a bit of a dick move
---
Maybe so they don't do that think that it'll work, chief.
---
that's what I was thinking about
---

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis.

I've received 4 large, 2 medium and 2 small just yesterday. I did get the large gifts when i was sleeping.  Just laid down in game and went doing other stuff came back 10 min later and found a large. Did this again later and got another large in the same session. Still no Plasma plan though...did get a laser gun plan but that was it other than the million mounted heads and Nukashine.
---
Mirelurk queen scythe would be awesome! Gives me that RS Nox Scythe vibe.
---
Question about FO 1st..does it still have an AFK time? Or can you just stay logged in indefinitely
---
I have almost 2k Ultracite scrap, so I'll try to sell that. Thanks!
---
I have a lot of Double weapons. I guess I can try to sell those, thanks!
---
Double can make decent caps, but it depends on the weapon. I'd post a listing with the market listing them all and see if you get bites. Just put your want as cap offers, trade offers, whatever. The scrap boxes have made junk less valuable, but ballistic fiber and springs and sometimes screws move for me. I sell bobbleheads for 25, which is way undervalue, but they move fast. I'll buy the explosive ones, and buyers seem to really like the big guns and melee ones. Outfits run the spectrum from worthless to very valuable, so that all depends on rarity.
---
I seriously dont know if you are trolling or not, but even if you are, they will take it seriously, so stop right there, criminal scum!
---
Or even better, make a macro that spams the button 1000x a second while you're out running around with friends.
---
You have violated the law!!
---
Yes I‚Äôm serious, every time my fallout 1st subscription gets renewed, I touch my self inappropriately.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
You just need to buy my 4 dozen Single-action revolver ivory grip plans and everything will work great for you.
---
Why were you downvoted? Upvoted because you're right- **You cannot die from lack of Food/Water** but your health gets very very low.
---
Well apart from supposedly changing from urban to forest you can't 
---
BUT according to a datamine source there are some skins to change the scout armor planned in a future release
---
They could do it in just one of the cleaner parts, say toxic valley. Then if you move your CAMP there you get to have some snow on the ground outside.
---
correct. I have noticed I tend to get the bulk of my sales in the first 15 minutes of arriving at a server. If I am light in inventory and need to fill up my vendors I will launch all three nukes on the same server and kill the queen 3 times, perhaps even farm for specific holes in my inventory. 
---
if I am heavy and need to sell I will just show up start a nuke card drone mission, maybe take a power plant and earn some ammo. just basically keep busy for about 30 minutes then I will server hop. 
---
if I am sort of moderately stocked I will kill a queen and server hop etc. 
---
basically how much room I have dictates my pace if I stayed full tilt boogy queen farm I would not be able to store all the legendaries and i would get very bored with the game. so when I get full I chill with the queen and go do other stuff for fun. 
---
so yeah in summary the more fresh servers you go to the faster you will sell. it takes people a few minutes to start showing up but after 15 or so minutes you are most likely not going to make many sales on that server.
---
Fear Of Missing Out
---
I never though to check the weightless items, but now you mention it I'm sure I'll have a lot of things too.  
---
I was crashing constantly last night so when I tried to do inventory management I found I had eleven glitched fusion cores - they didn't take up any weight in the stashbox - so when I dumped those I was able to access a workbench to modify items, but still crashed when I tried to create something.
---
If you can get anyone to do the mission
---
My personal record is killing a lvl 1051...  
---
 https://imgur.com/0oauNSQ
---
And while you are at it add a poison resistance 'lining' to the PA arms.
---
No one in their right minds would do PA unarmed, that way we can put something useful on that 'spot' rather than leaving it blank or 'glitching' a jetpack there.
---
malborn speaks the truth here I agree with him. 
---
\#5 on selling stims and super stims I price them at 5 for reg and diluted stims and 10 for super stims. they sell out pretty fast. disease cures dissappear as quick as i post them but I generally use those instead of sell them. I dont craft them so its rare i find a bunch extra to sell.
---
As all my five characters are over level 100 I will have to play with those.
---
I've one in my vendor, along with the other Mistress of Mystery items.  if I ever get past the Blue Screens you're welcome to it.
---
Doesn't need any modifications, it's just a (pair) of things you plug into powersockets.  All UL certified safe.
---
In xbox one i bought the cement tire pack but no jagged cement tire wall
---
Pls help
---
Dude, it's going to happen. For your own sake, try not to get too hyped.
---
I sell base stims for 22 and diluted for 10 - I frequently get cleared out of Base but diluted never moves (Past week is a bit slow but bethesda has managed to make an actual caps sink for once, so not un-surpsing)
---
Disease Cures I craft and sell for 12 a piece, they frequently sell (I only put 10 in at a time)
---
Im on pc. Sorry for late reply.
---
my diluted moves at 5 per, usually by sub 30 players  buying every aid they can get their mitts on :)
---
Holy shit man on all of that. Bad ass house too!
---
Np hit me up if you change your mind üëç Think I saw another post if someone selling X01 mods on here if u search
---
Ahahah!
---
It happened to me last night sitting in a bar. I don't think the game likes having to teleport you whilst sat.
---
nope stick with it. pistols can rock . you just have to find that thing you are missing in the occasion. ie  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI) &lt;--as an example
---
dont like steath commando you can go junkie, unyielding, you can be tankie or you can be glass canony. single shot rifle or commando, big iron or laser pistol. 
---
pistols more than any other weapon have one hell of a wall around level 40. if you can hold out till you get that build just right and or that just right pistol they are worth it. 
---
i am going to make the assaultron head work one of these days. I have failed so far but I beleive its possible.
---
Bug or Feature?
---
Unfortunate but also hilarious, have fun in hell lol üòÇ
---
You should be a journalist or write news papers.
---
Imagine posting this anywhere else but this sub.
---
Indeed. I've read that there isn't much of a boost in AP refresh from Lone Wanderer and Action Girl. They don't stack well, like a 1% boost. 
---
I'm testing it this weekend if I can free some scrip off my commando dude. Santa sure rains down the scrip.
---
Either they have an ungodly amount of time in the game or they have used an exploit. Either way is lame.
---
Rudolph the Glowing Radstag
---
Has a very shiny nose
---
And if you ever saw it
---
You'd find it irradiates!
---
All of the bluish Vault Dwellers
---
Used to jump and shoot at him
---
They'd never let poor Rudolph
---
Live through night and see the day
---
Yeah that looks like the perfect place for me. I wouldn't mind the scorched. Can they kill the scavenger bots?Yeah I haven't got the red rocket bundle but your right that would be a great place for it. 
---
Yeah that will be cool being able to incorporate some of the existing structures. Thanks for your help.
---
Yeah I have had a look around Flatwoods before but couldn't find a place for my camp (on a different character), I guess I just need to find the certain places where I can build.
---
Mr Fuzzy is your friend
---
Mr Fuzzy wants to play
---
Lol
---
Yeah what it's literally the same as any other pc game with mouse.
---
This is right. Stand your ground and shoot any trespasser.
---
Lmao I‚Äôm just saying they could easily make the Legendarys and implement the red glowing light that the Officers have onto the rad stage lmao
---
Then my math was right. 
---
Demo 3 would be adding +8%, like I said. 
---
(4+2+2)
---
Members of the Fallout 76 community are going Grinch-hunting in-game for fuckery this weekend.
---
XB1 love launching nukes. Went to swipe the keycard and got cut off a few days ago. Log back on to a missing keycard lol üòÜ not one of my happiest moments..
---
What‚Äôs so good about the plasma grenade plans?
---
They fixed it you should get me every hour now.
---
Just nuke them lmao
---
You cannot have the same experience of leaving the vault and having no other humans alive around and trying to find out what happened to them. There are going to be two people at the vault entrance. Immediately you have a different experience and it fundamentally changes the story. 
---
You may not see it as a problem, but it doesn‚Äôt make me wrong for staying the main story is not being preserved in its original state. This isnt about the game being open world. This is a change to the underlying narrative. 
---
This isn‚Äôt the direction I wanted them to go. I wanted to see humans come back after we destroyed the SBQ, continuing the narrative. It‚Äôs sad to me that new players will not be able to have the same experience as existing players.
---
What are they putting in the coffee at Red Rocket?
---
100% RNG
---
I have a dumb question for you when you say enclosure do you mean three standard walls a locked door &amp; a roof or something else? I want to build one for my Father Christmas too.
---
Had someone at my camp last night try to pick the locks on mine. Did an enclosure around 3 sides and the roof, the concrete tires and hay bales make good obstacles around the terminal and loot box. I like seeing Santa walk around.
---
I always find a camp of a level 20-50 person. Drop in give them a wave then drop all my plans and ammo I can‚Äôt be bothered to sell
---
Lock those santatron containers! *Evil laugh*
---
Amazing they worked Everytime. Exactly how you and your teacher wanted them to and you never encountered a problem! SRCSM
---
What no PC?
---
Fine. Time to mod in Preston, Pepper and The Perdwen for some holiday pizzazz.
---
I think it's to give the game a soft re-launch of sorts when Wastelanders comes out in hopes for better reception.
---
As for the crafting and scrapping lag it only happens to me in public worlds, private it works smoothly
---
I have one character, he has my face.
---
I went for PA+2H+heavy weapons at first
---
Then I added unarmed weapons and a BE combat shotgun to my arsenal
---
Then I added B25 Handmade and B1025 .44 to my arsenal
---
Now I am a ranger capable of all guns and melee.
---
Get that jazz singer who sings in that club in Goodneighbor.
---
Yeah and that is where the fun begins with figuring that out. I might have an idea. Testing will be needed and time.
---
I caved in and just got it myself. It‚Äôs become a requirement in this mode.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking joke when you‚Äôre shooting at someone and then they can just launch themselves in the air and rein down a bunch of shit on you.
---
You don‚Äôt need to screw over anything for a good NW build, my shitty rifleman build I made to be slightly optimized is fully ready for an NW build. If you need help, go to nukes and dragons, they added a build for your perk layout so you don‚Äôt have to earn cards to know what you need.
---
I'm on Xbox and the highest I've seen is 920. Ive been on and off since a month after release and I'm only 131. At over 1050, sweet lord talk about grinding
---
The Enclave thinks you should make more of these because they are cool
---
Did you check your RAM?
---
Oooh, that'd be interesting to see! :o
---
Rudolph's nose - it glows in the fucking dark!
---
we really need more weapons from animals in this game. Make Weapons special!
---
The Enclave thinks hw would make a fine addition to our ranks
---
Seen one on PS4 a few weeks ago. They killed the queen in record time. I put on my power armor and fast traveled to the Queen only to get the message that the quest was over.
---
Yeah!  Screw consoles! We‚Äôll have our own Christmas with hookers and gambling.
---
The Enclave will recruit these new settlers. And the Enclave thinks this is a great idea
---
With plans I generally looked around the vault for lobbies and pop in, run up, wave them over, and drop the plans, a few stimpaks, a gun, and ammo.
---
I tried both and prefer .50 Cal for it's ammo efficiency - almost 4 times bigger ammo capacity make it comparable in dps despite lower firerate. Not to mention the amount of ultracite ammo crafted for each gun and more badass look ;)))
---
If you buy up every leader and intelligence bobblehead you can in advance, grind for Sugar Bombs to craft Brain Bombs and starlight berries to craft Berry Mentats, keep yourself stocked with Cranberry Relishes, and have a full set of Unyielding armor (for the intelligence boost), it is possible to jump 100+ levels on a double XP weekend if you spend a decent amount of time on all 4 days of the weekend and run the right route.
---
I know this because I went from 198 to 301 this past weekend.
---
So if this player said they got there legit, I'd believe it.
---
My main character (lvl 336) is a Heavy Weapons PA-build. I play him as a scavenger who runs a small mining and trading settlement south of Whitesprings. I do very little roleplay in this game, but when I do play him as an elderly man, slightly paranoid who is a hoarder by heart. All the loot. Made his camp look very simple and worn down, but functional. Dresses in different raider-like wearables, but currently the caravan outfit is my new love, along with the santa beard, shaved head and raider metal eyepatch.
---
I do my alts on different accounts to make trading between them easier.
---
My first alt (lvl 86) is on my wife's account. It is a stealth-sniper build with focus on hard hitting ranged weapons. I often use her to help newbies by sneaking around the Forest and helping them finish of "hard" opponents and leave small gifts on the road. She has her camp close to my main's, making them part of the same settlement. Dresses in the travelling leather coat, green hood, glasses and mistress of mystery veil.
---
My second alt (lvl 83) is on my girlfriends account. Tried a bloodied build here. Mainly melee (have 3 Unstoppable Monster Legendaries on her), but with some automatics rifles as backup. Play her as a bit of a crazy lady who could not handle the devastation of the wasteland and lost it a bit. She runs a gasstation south of Summersville. Dresses in winterjacket and jeans with glasses.
---
They're like really low level Scorched.  Level 6 I believe?  Armed with shotguns primarily.  They spawn near the garage entrance door, and over by the gas pumps.  So given time, they can destroy stuff, but with turrets, they will usually die before they can get hits in.  Even if so, repairing the SantaTron/Collectron is pretty cheap if they do.
---
When I had a camp there, all I needed was one elevated turret stand outside, and one turret setup inside the garage, and it covered the basic spawn points.
---
That can‚Äôt be true. Bethesda is technically incapable of handling the duping problem since there‚Äôs no unique ID for each legendary item. The system doesn‚Äôt check players‚Äô inventory against a central database so they essentially can never tell what‚Äôs duped.
---
id love to see this as an Enclave event, Modus deploys an impossible to repair emitter that lures in as many creatures as it can. when the emitter is broken the event ends and the reward is based on how many vermin are destroyed
---
I learned exactly how much I can carry when fooling around with a full set of weapon weight reduction gear. with an inventory full of heavy weapons, I can go from 250 weight to 2000 just by taking off the one perk and taking off all the gear. it was very handy for a certain trick that doesn't work anymore
---
The .50 Cal will be cheaper to resupply ammo through crafting.
---
Diablo 2 has a gold currency as we'll. The reason gold wasn't used as a trading medium in d2 was because you drop 100% of the gold you are carrying on death.  On top of the fact that gold did have value on d2 people used to buy a full stash of gold for a HR to gamble for rare jewelry and circlets.
---
I write it before and repeat here - there is easy trick for that and all you need is a friend (or someone who will want to help you).
---
1. Fast Travel to Mosstown and go towards Crashed Plane - there is 100% Mega Sloth spawn
---
2. Join the team with someone, shot the enemy once not to kill it and fast travel to any location in Cranberry while your team-mate waiting for your signal.
---
3. when your're in CB say (voice chat) or he has to see your dot on map and he kills the sloth. Since you marked the monster you'll get challenge done. 
---
4. Server hop to change roles or fast travel to Treetops, also in Mire (there you can have either Mega Sloth or Snallygasters)
---
It works with every challenge "Kill .... in ....", i.e Radscorpions in Savage Divide or Cave Crickett in Uncany Caverns, but that one with sloth is the easiest due to how slow the monster is.
---
**Gasp!!!**  
---
*"What have you done to Al!"*
---
Tagging u/RedPhantom20
---
ah.  It was getting some WR armor and adding deep pockets that allowed me to occasionally get out of my Excavator.  
---
Now if I could just get the DR a bit higher.... I'd be good to go.
---
Thank you for your correction!
---
for example, thats a good idea.
---
I'll make sure to be certain with my facts next time!
---
Thanks!
---
Yea sure but a fully protected Bloodied can also get much higher damage buff so why not just run bloodied instead. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄòOh carp all my armors are broken at the same time I better pull out my Berserkers bazooka to take advantage of it‚Äô, that just doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
yeah but i did hear the music for like a sec when i loaded back in scared the s\*\*\* out of me
---
In my experience ammo will never sell if you‚Äôre charging more than 0 caps unless it‚Äôs 5.56 or .50 or plasma cells. Those will sell at 1cpr but not any higher so they‚Äôre not worth it honestly. I will never make ammo to sell it again.
---
Xbox
---
ok babe but before you bust a nut thinking you know shit, all they'd have to change is the scorched texture overlay that gets applied to objects in NW üòâ
---
It's pretty surreal to see a good community in a game now days, especially after all the bad things i heard about FO76 and the community. I was expecting it to be, well, the typical experience but people has been surprizingly civil and even nice. It's something I miss from the ye'ole golden days I remmeber as people being generaly nicer.
---
The ammount of nice replies to this post, about leaving gifts and items to help people made me feel nice vibes which I needed. Been a rough holiday this year for me since I have no family after losing my mom last month and just seeing good will in a online game of all things went a long way to brighten my mood. 
---
Dropped off plans at the morgan towne station and chased down a player and gave them 40 diluted radaways since i had all manners of hell with rads when I started out. Still nervous about joining random teams especialy with no mic but I'm finding my self loving the game more and more.
---
I get hungry and thirsty way more frequent now than before patch. Wastelander MREs coming to the atom shop in 3...2...1...
---
That's a neat trick, will need to try that!
---
Yes, brothers! 
---
Tonight we sing!
---
Sure, but we got a Guerilla one, even though I have yet to kill one in Appalachia.
---
report him and move on.simple as that
---
One handed weapons are faster while two handed hit harder and do more damage.
---
50 cal will have better sustained DPS than the LMG due to the larger magazine size and less need to frequently reload.
---
No you did a great job! I'm obsessed with the lore and stories of Fallout, you ever need help with anything hit me up!
---
They already do that.
---
Thank you I will!
---
You stay away from my friend you monster!  :p
---
I was actually kind of wondering the same thing...
---
It is an extremely rare drop now. Some swear you could only get it from Enclave events while others report it as a world drop. At launch it was common and easy to get from events but then the drop chance got hit. I've seen offers of 12k for either mask.
---
It kinda sucks that we‚Äôll never see the prydwyn again because there was the option to destroy it in 4.
---
Very nice. I too couldn‚Äôt get any lights on it.
---
How is it selfish if no one has it? If no one has it as a perk, they can risk getting through radiation so that way players have a much fairer chance to get the marsupial mutation and not get screwed over by players who have it already as a perk. Its essentially high risk high reward, as yes you can get other mutations that you may or may not want but you may also get Marsupial. Imagine if chameleon was a perk available to everyone? The game would have a crap ton of campers just sitting and waiting. Whole squads would just sit and gun down any people that pass by. Players with frog legs already do that, and its not fair that the game is essentially needing you to either get frog legs in your deck or get fucked.
---
Isn't there only one perk card that increases unarmed damage (iron fist), while three for 1 hand (gladiator) or 2 hand (slugger)? So depending how much strength you have, you could reach higher damage with 1 or 2 hand. Of course, all depending on what weapon you have.
---
Totally worked for me and by that I mean I went somewhere but the song never stopped. It was one hell of a hangover!
---
It just depends on what you get. In previous 3D Fallouts the range of the melee weapon was pretty significant in its use. In 76 you are within punching range nine times out of ten. If you get say a Bloodied Swing Speed +1 Strength Sheepsquatch Staff and you can fully mod it it out paces say a Executioner's Death Tambo.
---
There's plenty that are RNG Legendaries...  Are you asking about guaranteed drops from quests?
---
If so, I'd say the best would be either the Blade of Bastet from running the Order of Mysteries quest (*can be recrafted to level, as long as you keep the original*) or The Gutter from running the Barrows Quest the first time (*do it at level 50+ so the blade is level 50*).
---
The Blade of Bastet at base, has 50% armor penetration.  If you wear the entire MoM regalia, you get 100% armor penetration with it.  The Gutter is equivalent to a 2* Legendary, with an enhanced damage and vampiric regen set of traits.
---
In PvP you will not be harmed unless you attack back.
---
Thanks mate.
---
The LMG, while the better one, is just two difficult to keep up with it's ammo demand. Even when crafting Ultracite 308 you don't get much in comparison to Ultracite 50. I've been hoarding 308 on all 5 characters just so I could use an LMG freely.
---
I‚Äôm not crying you are
---
depends on the scenario.  Unarmed against a single enemy, or unarmed against a group of melee enemies is one thing.  
---
Unarmed against a group of things with automatic weapons is something else.
---
However, the simple answer for my build is Faster weapon speed.  
---
Some fast 1H low damage weapons can do more damage in the same time frame than a slow 2H weapon with high damage.
---
e.g.  Without performance enhancing foods, chems, etc, (and with standard swing, not a power attack) my (fast) switchblade is rated at about 80 dmg.  My (slow) supersledge is rated at 180.   However, the switchblade hits 3x in the time it takes the sledge to hit 1x.  
---
3 x 80 = 240
---
1 x 180 = 180.
---
switchblade does more damage in the same time frame.  
---
I cannot go unarmed against a group of supermutants with automatic weapons.   My non-pa armor does not have the DR - so when armed with ... say a DCG or meathook, I may be able to 1 hit a L48 SM or 2 hit a L68 SM, but when the 2nd+ SMs in the group start shooting at me with assault rifles, I cannot get to mutant 2 and 3 before the bullets kill me.  
---
In (excavator, usually) PA with my switchblade, I can take them all out.
---

Mention that the enclave released the plague to try and get into a defcon 1 event
---
maybe bring in their severed head (or ear) as the "proof of death" legendary named human like enemies (random names) will spawn and they are said bounties. can even link back to player bounties, if someone takes your ear you lose 5 Perception and have to claim your ear from the Marshal to have it re-attached, and repay the "Bounty Fee"
---
The lobber tesla is only available as non legendary and not available as a mod. The rest of the mods work on any tesla.

Probably not the best gun to invest in. It is broken and commonly glitches bad guys into invincibility. The only way to fix is to log out.

Alright cool. I have a TSE single action revolver if youre interested so just hmu. My GT is "A Headless Guy"
---
I‚Äôd like a live mole miner attached to a pole, he can use his gauntlet or grenade launcher whichever he likes at the time of the fight. This Poleminer must come with extra bashing and 90% WR so it should weigh only 80 lbs.
---
Back in the day I used the get alot of them in the enclave events
---
I‚Äôm gonna try it, fuzzy travel?
---
They should of shown it in the pics. The only saw people have it so I thought, wtf!? Either way, Now you know and knowing is half the battle.
---
Fisto has entered the chat.
---
If they have marsupial they can jump over the walls.
---
IMHO, several.  
---
My goto for almost 100 levels has been a vampire switchblade (modded for serrated blade).  Backup is The Gutter (modded to add electrical damage).
---
Others I have used as primary weapons : Vampire machete, Blade of Bastet, AA spiked ski sword, black diamond.
---
Out of PA: any of the above, plus Death tambo, deathclaw gauntlet, meathook, MM gauntlet (extra hooks/claws as appropriate) , spiked knuckles
---
Yes
---
But I don't think it tells you who took it.
---
Yes if he take all - you'll get something like "your loot bag have been claimed by someone" or similar. If he take only some items you won't get info.
---
And to prevent question - after SBQ fight when you'll get fluxes and you die right after you'll loose all fluxes - it's a bug, no one stole it from you...

Thanks everyone for the responses!

Non-disclosure agreement. Basically anyone participating can't divulge information about the test (such as making a video featuring all the bugs) until an agreed upon time.
---
What? You actually got a quest reward from a present? 
---
That doesn‚Äôt seem right.
---
I posted a link to the image and the rest was the result of of magic
---
I‚Äôd love to have a mounted Robobrain‚Äôs brain
---
"I want to get off Mr Fuzzys wild ride"
---
Well that's a group event. I think we need those too, but yeah, thats pretty tough solo.
---
I've been told that there is no stupid question so that being said, if I have the armor already can I use ultracite mods straight out of my mod inventory to upgrade the heart strangler armor and if so would I need the vault 94 steel for upgrading mods? thanks.. There is so much to learn,
---
Do the maths: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Make sure for enemy type you select the queen.
---
It doesn't tell you who took it. It just says something along the lines of "someone has picked up your dropped loot"
---
If you take or add anything to another players death bag, they recieve a notification saying another player has taken their loot.
---
I think it would be really fun idea. I especially like the idea of having to take it to the police stations. It would also work with the penitentiary. They could fall under escapees.
---
A few tweaks I'd like to add; make it repairable for 20-30 seconds, if not repaired by then, failure.
---
This will make the annoying tunnel visions frenemies have a bit more bearable.
---
Seriously their tunnel vision is so bad they're sometimes marked as friendly.
---
Thanks
---
I've got a Stealth Sniper main that's switching to a Melee build, a VTU frat dude for RP, and a BoS Recon Scout for RP.
---
Ok later.
---
My Santatron has a perfect explanation on why this isn't possible.
---
You want to be able to one shot the mobs.  I can one shot any 3 star mob with an instigating grognards axe (or super sledge) using a power attack. (Except scortched beasts) If I had better armor I could do the same one handed or unarmed but don't quite have the strength for it.  
---
Junkies are also amazing and get too the same point . 
---
Really what ever is fun for you do that.
---
Santatron delivers now, a lot. I'm just hoping to find that sweet looking moth man statue plan from him now. You can also build him at workshops. If you are on a private server that would end up being a lot of presents
---
I‚Äôve seen a lvl 1700, I can post a ss tomorrow if anyone‚Äôs interested but yeah 1700 is by far the highest I‚Äôve seen
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Ah yes, you are doing gods work!
---
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good fight!
---
There's also a spawn point just down the road from Watoga station that has a chance to spawn a megasloth
---
I see your 2 cents and raise you mine. Wouldn't call it FOMO but rather the will to maximize my margins within my time constraints ;)
---
Dont you loose the workshop if not defending it? Im too lazy to do that lol
---
I still go old school with my unwanted plans, recipes, and ammo and drop them in blue suitcases outside train stations.  I figure somebody out there, especially a lowbie, might want them.  Charleston Station is my drop of choice since it is a pretty convenient location for people who are new to the game.
---
I really like that you used the icicle lights!
---
Because the reason he doesn't want frog legs is the reason he doesn't want other mutations to be perks, which is granting everyone the ese of access to said ability.
---
But he is ok when he is the only few receiving the perk.
---
BSS Deathtambo or Mole Miner Gauntlet or my personal faves.
---
LET ME IN, LET ME IINNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!
---
Doesnt nodes disappear when you farm them though?
---
It's also a good point, thanks.
---
Sadly this my request is not upvoted a lot :) So probably Bethesda will conclude that Steam achievements are not important for community.
---
I built him a 1 block foundation with 3 walls a doorway in front of his opening and a roof. He seems to get in and out just fine. And so far none has been able to get in.
---
I‚Äôm amazed no one has publicly broken their NDA yet ;)
---
JONK is my boi. Created from a joke in a Minecraft Let's Play he has become my new main and my favorite Fallout character I've ever made. 
---
An educated but timid man who's psyche shattered at the state of a post apocalyptic world. His long locks that were the envy of his female Vault inhabitants was crudely cut with a dull blade he found near Sutton. (This was around Faschnat so some of his fellow Dwellers noted the change). Due to his large nature (max fat) bats were a common use for him in the early days out of the vault. It was when he caved in the hear of a Scorch that he fell to his knees and wept. He fumbled his hands on the ground for anything to wipe away the blood and tears that blinded him. A crude sack was all he found but it was used nonetheless. That's when it began. (Weird that the sack is such a rare item. I've only ever found two in my 600 hours. Finding clothing is what made JONK to what it became.)
---
Once his eyes were cleared a sense of calm overtook him. The sack he held had two eye holes cut out of it. Old blood was still caked on it but was now mixed with knew. For whatever reason he put the sack on and from that moment on he was no longer a man. Just... something not right. 
---
Where once there was fear in facing the hordes of terrors of the waste there was now only reckless abandon. Safety was of no concern as IT charged head first into his foes and whether with bat or blade or even bare hands bludgeon and tear enemies apart. For awhile JONK settled in the forest but due to lack of water and food set up C.A.M.P. in the now dried up dambed of Charleston. From the scrap of ships it built itself water purifiers and hunted in the region. It found a still wearable setup of fishing attire and donned that, but never removed the mask. The mask was part of it. (Started getting serial killer and Dead by Daylight vibes at this point) All that was there were crops to sell, a pot to cook, and a torn mattress to sleep on. He hauled a heavy oak desk from the ruins of its beloved city and slammed it down facing east. 
---
There it sat long days and nights just staring at the Super Mutants preparing their meals and killing its fellow dwellers. After a fortnight he leapt over the desk, through the crops, and past the crudely placed barricades now riddled with bullet holes and charged headfirst into gunfire into a group of mutants. When all was said and done its arms were shattered from the blows it gave to the mutants and one lay dying before it, missing both legs having been blown off from grenades. A hunger, a deep hunger overtook it and with fingers like daggers plunged straight into the screaming mutants stomache. The muscles were strong but it had become stronger and organs started to show. That was when it feasted and the mutant crushed it's own head with its hands to stop the pain. 
---
I should probably stop. XD JONK was my fourth character I created but became my highest level and most played character. Everything is specific in how I approach things because this character is molded to be something I normal don't play as.
---
All of my characters have the same like build because I just do whatever is comfortable for me. So they're all a bloody build but have different weapons.  But they all have their own personalities. My current girls are 
---
\-Bandito - who's a bit rough around the edges and likes to keep to herself. She's got a bilt of a raider/cultist tendency and keeps out of the way. It's just her and her Deathclaw against the world as far as she's concerned. She's a fan of the cultist apparel but spends most of her time as a land pirate. She is a ghoul in my head. She carries a deathclaw gauntlet or a meat hook depending on the day. She's shit for aim so she carries a handmade for the ol spray and pray. 
---
\-Untoten  - she's a bit stand-offish and skeptical of people but very loyal once she gets to know them and is always willing to help anyway she can. She's got a soft spot for all critters except insects and she only fears feral ghouls. She's more of a sneaky type and prefers her lever action to take shots from rooftops, she keeps a bowie knife for close encounters. 
---
\-Sonni - this girl is fresh out of the vault and is currently waiting for wastelanders. She's got a little camp down by the overseer's where she does some trading. I have a feeling she's going to be good friends with Mort.
---
sadly that may make it too easy, just have someone sitting there to repair it.. unless it operates on a continuous timer. example timer is 1 min until mission failure, you repair it with 27 seconds to spare, next time it breaks it only gets 27 seconds
---
Can you be more specific, please? 
---
I've actually been trying to find a Mega Sloth to tame, since the game kept killing mine when I loaded into my camp... I used to get them easily at the Cranberry Glade, but haven't found one there in 2 months, server hopping for hours at a time.
---
12k eh? I bought a forest mask for 21k, before you could change their paint to either color.
---
I learned this on piano and played it in the mall
---
Unarmed blows 2h out of the water in dps because it has 2 mutations it benefits from and a faster base attack speed.
---
Good point, forgot about mutations!
---
this is really cool!   Can you add a link to the stream page / where to donate?
---
So...what?  They embrace them?
---
&gt; Campfire takes daily quest at camp Adam but I just server hopped 20+ times and it's not spawning
---
They made this a public event, which means it is no longer triggered by time of day and proximity.  Now you just have to watch for it to spawn.
---
&gt; I saw someone saying other quests also give them but don't know for sure if that's true.
---
Stings and Things at Dolly Sods and Operation Tidy at Kiddie Corner Cabins are the only other two that have a chance at awarding badges.  Since they are dailies, you can only do them once per day.
---
&gt; The world quests seem like a hassle for 1 badge and aren't some supposed to be bugged and you cant finish?
---
I believe most of the initial bugs have been patched, though I have heard players say that sometimes powering up a plant doesn't show as complete for the electrician badge.  
---
Personally, I thought the world quests were fun.  Yes, some of them took longer to complete than others but I suppose I am a patient man. If there are any particular world quests you'd like tips on completing, just let me know.
---
I found 3 last night at the cranberry glade trying to tame a deathclaw. I would keep hopping there. I don't know if the one down the road from the Watoga station is tameable - in any case there's normally other mobs there - it's down the road across the train tracks from the little tower. Sorry I am awful at directions
---
You'd love to mount a robobrain's brain.
---
you need addictions to chems and booze (5 at most)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs the only killable Flatwoods Monster. Everything else teleports away.
---
I did that. This forum helped me alot yesterday figuring that out but feel like I am not doing that much dmg.
---
oh I didn't realise they could go through walls, cool! thx
---
thx, I'm going to build mine now :)
---
Fantastic
---
Okay thanks! Guess I just have really bad luck.
---
12k Gawd Damn, might have to grind now to try to get one for selling it, sounds like the Plasma Grenade  Plans. I guess my Easter Head wear will suffice for now.
---
IRL they actually have to get over a spiked wrought iron fence and then past two 80lb shepherds and then a second fence to get to mine.  I wish my door was as difficult to get to in-game but i don't have the camp budget to match. (And can't tame pets yet)
---
That's not what I meant but good to know.
---
Why are you speaking for the enclave? You are not the great MODUS
---
To be fair - I hopped for about 4 hours last night before I got a deathclaw so - it just takes too much time :( I hope you can find a sloth soon
---
I use whatever melee weapon is fun at the time. Quite fond of my combat daggers for that rogue feel and I have a simple chain wrapped bat that does most of the grunt work.  But when I really want to get serious about melee it's always with a fist weapon.  Nothing compares to fist weapon damage since it double dips mutations.  Got a pair of mole miner gauntlets I like to flip flop through, one bloodied the other vampires, and just shred everything in sight.
---
Tldr: You can use whatever because funsies but in the end no, nothing compares to a fist weapon.
---
Good luck. Make sure you set your Santa on the foundation first. Then build around him otherwise you get the object is blocked error. Once you've got the walls and doorway around him, you can move the unit left or right and front to back to center it in the doorway. Happy trails!
---
Seriously? 
---
The loot was only J&amp;K block, 10mm round and some other junk
---
I use third party site and upload the link due to the refresh. You could try that.
---
Lol that‚Äôs great, I had invisible mole rats once so I ran to my camp which was luckily nearby so my turrets would kill them
---
When you switch from bloodied you'll see significantly lower damage due to two reasons:
---
\- max damage bonus for junkies is 50% with 5 addictions while for bloodied is 90% while below certain threshold (don't remember the exact amount, 19% I think).
---
\- when you're junkies and full health you also loose two significant damage multipliers - Adrenal reaction mutation and Nerd rage perk.
---
So the total damage output seems much lower than bloodied.
---
&gt;!If you go in photo mode and move the camera close to the helmet of the Flatwoods Monster you will see that it is in fact an very small alien (about two feet tall) in a kind of flying power armor.
---
Its arm length only reach the elbow of the suit and he is standing on a small platform inside the lower part of the suit.
---
If you do him some light damage he will teleport away. If you do a good amount of damage on the first shot it will engage combat.
---
Note that it can mentally take control of nearby mobs to attack you. The controlled mob will have a pink aura.!&lt;
---
This is really sweet of you guys to do.
---
Those are Unarmed.
---
I approve this message :)
---
Yeah he took control of wolfs they had pink to start with then it turned purple. I just thought it was a perk, until I heard jets and I saw him attacking me. So I just opened fire. Didn‚Äôt know what it was until now
---
They're also one-handed
---
Hi :)
---
A guy posted a screen shot of getting 3 jumpsuits and both masks from completing the messenger event. He did say it took him quite a few though.
---
I fucking loved the displacer glove, would like to see that again
---
I've been pulling this on my friends for a while!!! They found hoping in power armor helps or getting back on the offending ride will stop the loop of music mayhem!
---
IMO, there isn't.  Unarmed benefits from that whole extra mutation, Talons, devoted exclusively to it.  Plus, one of the key aspects of 2h weapons that fell by the wayside in 76 is crowd control.  In 4, you could hit multiple enemies in one swing.  76 has a limit of one target per swing, which completely neuters 2h melee.
---
The only character I really play is Scout Master Beastie, wearing full possum scout regalia.  He always wears a gas mask because his face is horribly disfigured from his first encounter with a snallygaster's acid attack.  He was a Pioneer Scout when he was a kid and he has latched onto rebuilding the Scouts because the values they instilled in him are the only things that make sense any more. He's built Camp Wendigo (a mini-scout camp) up in the hills behind the munitions factory and as a recruiting technique will often drop off goody bags to low levels that include a Bowie knife with Pioneer Scout paint, Healing Salve, Purified water, some food, and a random page from the scout manual.
---
I give away extra plans all the time, and have never locked my lead, my water, my house, or my bot. The wasteland is a harsh place, gotta help out our fellow dwellers when we can.
---
It can't be bought from MODUS and it doesn't drop from Enclave events, because this would make too much sense, apparently. It's a super rare drop (0.01% chance) from events in the Savage Divide, i.e. Messenger, Violent Night, Meditation, Uranium Fever, etc.
---
Yes, any of them. Just answering.
---
the gatling laser is classified as a big gun, since it is bloodied you want a big guns bloodied build setup, either in Power armor (for stabilized) or not (for legendary armor)
---
Actually i just check. There were zero presenrs from many players
---
 The gift option was not evem available till the patch. Ide estimate almost zero presents were given
---
You're right, I think only the Dragon and Ripper were removed from the normal legendary lists. Black powder rifles and pistols no longer drop with the Quad effect.
---
These are the legendary drop lists:  https://imgur.com/a/d5AXerq
---
Hmm..makes sense. Feels like a big trade off.
---
BOOO HOOOOO! They‚Äôre selling for 10,000 caps at the few camps I‚Äôve seen the plans for. I‚Äôve got 15  high quality I‚Äôve either crafted or received form drops and am waiting like a little kid until Christmas to open them. Good for you, selling things at a very reasonable rate &lt;3
---
I had a roommate that would buy from one of those guys. I have to admit, the pre-made burger patties and the bacon-wrapped filet mignon he had were actually pretty good you just had to buy in bulk and since they were feeding a family of five it worked out for them. Didn't change my opinion of people who come up to my door unsolicited though.
---
Frog Legs is mandatory, and automatic weapons are extremely prevalent and effective. I think you might just have to use the meta honestly.
---
Mass Effect. Warframe. Halo ODST.
---
Jesus...
---
I love seeing these kinds of posts!   Good on you!
---
I'll try and find a Steam link for you.
---
True. I do the same for most resources (water purifiers, etc), but an unlocked Santatron is exceptionally generous!!
---
I'm still trying to kill a megasloth in the bog
---
Too big for me, I'll stay with bloodied
---
How can you not be happy with a Charlie Brown Christmas tree
---
Nah, man.  That *is* a feature. üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm leaning more towards power armour tbh bc I‚Äôm gonna be somewhat roleplaying as a brotherhood member
---
The only reason I said that is because I got an instigating black powder pistol the other day that I've been laughingly carrying around dinging scorched with for the challenge, lol.
---
Thanks for the list. It's nice to get a better idea of what's available even if I'm only going to get Broadsider's and Fat Man's 95% of the time.
---
I really like the idea, it‚Äôs just too small. I don‚Äôt mean that in the sense that there isn‚Äôt a lot on it, it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs barely noticeable if you put it outside.
---
Because he didn't get the reference
---
I was excited for this but rhymes died for it to exist.
---
Thank you so much.
---
It's kind of weird that it was left out.
---
I've found that it works alright under Chrome or the built-in Samsung Browser on my mobile devices.  It's terrible on Firefox.
---
Next week Atom Shop?
---
Why is this upvoted
---
You are kicked for idling and idling is a massive issue either way. The amount of people idling in this game is huge.
---
And it is a goal, it is listed In Challenges.
---
It's not like it'd affect community interaction? People who don't wish to communicate won't communicate. Nothing will change and people will get kicked for idling
---
Know your place commoner. I am none other than the General of the United States Military. I am in charge of the Enclave and therefore speak for it.
---
Oooohhhhhhh
---
Damn son
---
And that kids is why you don‚Äôt drink Nukashine!
---
I sometimes feel bad about hiding on s private server ...but then I realize it's so drama free and the people who play with me are unlikely to cause mischief.
---
Dont you see the flair next to my name. That is proof of my affiliation with the Enclave
---
I wasnt aware that the enclave leader had ties with santatron.
---
Slocum's Joe*
---
Of course. Santatron has a special protocol built inside of him. He is spying on the wastelanders and feeding us information about the survivors
---
The Drill took like 40 minutes it was so bad but back then I didn't really notice but looking back god it's horrible
---
I've done 12 at once while leveling my new character, and was only limited because I was lower level and didn't want to venture too far east.
---
What I do is just go into the build menu and switch a wall to a door when I want to loot the box and then change it right back. So no one but me can get to him
---
You won't get this plan. 2k caps bet.
---
Ouch!  Enjoy the holiday though!
---
Please tell me that you also sang the song too.
---
mine are unlocked but I'm on a private server generally with a santatron at each workshop while I'm off farming .  :)
---
Pretty sure they weren‚Äôt trying to weaponize them? Thought I read a terminal somewhere the leader of the enclave was trying to raise the DEFCON level for some reason by unleashing the scorchbeasts, but idk I might be wrong
---
Yea feel like I should have
---
Dupe the items that were spawned.
---
Quick question: What's your build in Adventure mode?
---
I have a commando build and a strength build, and they are both viable builds in Nuclear Winter, although the commando build is definitely the better option. My only gripe is that the perk cards aren't shared across all the characters on an account. When I started my strength build character I had to start unlocking all of the perk cards again after already unlocking them all with my previous character, but I used the overseer tickets wisely and only purchased perk cards that would benefit a heavy gunner build.
---
A duper for sure
---
Well you could just pick it up and then dump it at overseer's or something like that. That way you can still be polite and then continue going around doing the struggle.
---
Damn dude...it's a friggin' *video game*.  I understand you're upset, but it's not worth letting it impact you to the point that you're making threats of physical violence against the developers.  In this "dangerous and uncertain world" (to use your phrase) all that will accomplish is to get you investigated as a potential active shooter or domestic terrorist.
---
It's a lot of fun surprisingly. You watch other players fight it out and run circles around you, then you shoot them in the back of the head when they're not looking. You can see when they open their Pip Boy. Just jump out, shoot them, scream "Bush wookie" and go back to hiding.
---
the scrap box changed the game for me , now I  grab everything not nailed down as opposed to running past everything . it's a good feeling as I hated leaving things behind
---
I run bloodied unarmed and have a bloodied gatling plasma as a big fight gun (SBQ)...You can switch out a few cards in strength and use PA to fight the SBQ...It works really well...The switch for me is removing the unarmed cards and put in all of the Heavy Gunner cards and 1 each of bear arms, lock and load and bullet shield...I only run three in INT (nerd rage) but take it out and put in Stabillized (a must for heavy guns)....Just running around with that big gun all day doesn't work for me....LOL
---
Thank You :)
---
Funny, I had one in my camp last night too.  I was AFKing, but glanced at the screen at one point and noticed that my turrets had a pink glow.  Took me a minute to realize what was going on.
---
He can effect not only mobs, but mechanical things as well.  I've even seen videos of the scorchbeast queen under his control (I've personally seen regular scorchbeasts with the pink glow).  
---
It doesn't seem to have any significant effect other than who the controlled things target their attacks on.  COntrolled mobs won't attack it, and I've seen them stop attacking each other to focus on another target (usually me).
---
I got lucky during a nuke
---
Because you can't by default. Try attaching something to the tree trunk and then if the lights snap onto it, you're all set :)
---
I don't know, I'm 99% sure I'm right but, I'm always open to corrections.
---
Power User (Fusion Cores), Stabilised (As a PA User), Big Guns. Full charge
---
(overly) Hi INT will be useful for when you get round to craft Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
I just kind of do a sneaky rifle type of build. I try to be constantly moving from place to place unless you can secure a good roof top - there's one that accessible from the ground in morgantown but it's overlooked by the monorail. But sneaking around and only taking fights you know you can handle is a good way to make it to the end.

---
best i could come up with
---
My main is a builder, a trader, a heavy weapon and melee specialist, and a recovering shotgunner. I took weeks to overhaul him instead of starting a new character, and I rebuilt him to be versatile and a Jack of all trades. He's also the team player of my chars. He has a "town" camp build by Charleston fire department. 
---
Secondary character is a pistoleer medic. I was going to make him my raid guy but it turns I hate the raids He's also a brewer and a cook with a bar and doctors office near Flatwoods. I recently constructed an armory at his camp to store and display extraneous gear, so my main is free to farm and construct business. 
---
Third character is a sneak rifleman but I use her pretty much exclusively for NW. She doesn't really have a camp. Nobody knows where she spends her time between rounds.
---
I did but had to stop when the kids arrived
---
Just depends on how much you want to avoid dying.  Also, the barrier to entry is lower for junkie's, you don't need a set of specialized armor and perks.  But yes, the tradeoff is lower damage.
---
If you are doing PA, make sure you put an emergency protocol chest. It gives you some good buffs at low health. Use blocker, stabilized, one gun army, demolition expert, serendipity, bloody mess, and as many heavy Gunner perks as you can fit.
---
I removed a whole wall of my camp to be more inviting, but the satatron stays locked!
---
‚ÄúYou have became the very thing you swore to destroy‚Äù
---
No, they're not.  Go try assigning Iron Fist.  The damage doesn't change.  This has been a weirdly persistent rumor.  The Meat Hook is the only melee weapon that benefits from both.
---
yes, the blue holiday suit was offered last year. its not in the atom store right now (yet??) nor is the mrs clause suit, the elf costume or the reindeer for the yard decor from last year. i know more than a few people upset as they wanted to purchase some of those (myself included).
---
It would probably be easier to answer if you posted your current attributes and perks, it is easy to do that with the help of [this site](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks).
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt understand why it can‚Äôt be a mutation. Why should everyone have access to something so overpowered? If its a mutation, not everyone is guaranteed it. Thats the point. High level players would have to actually try for some of the match and if they get lucky can get the marsupial mutation. Frog legs is annoying as hell and if you don‚Äôt have enough agility points then you can‚Äôt even have it equipped.
---
Talk about duping
---
Power user perk is a must. 1000 shots per core.
---
The trashcan works just as well. Just print it out and put it in there. I have tickets from over a month ago that are unanswered and all follow-up tickets get closed as duplicates.
---
They are also wielded with one hand* OP didn't say anything about perks.
---
All of the armor peice plans
---
I started a new shotgun build over the double xp weekend. 
---
I have gun runner, and frog legs both equipped. With a combat shotgun, I consistently win 1v1's vs auto builds, and with the speed boost, I can flank while my teammates engage. 
---
Extremely satisfying to wipe a team with a shotgun, for some reason.
---
My current build:
---
Master Shotgunner
---
Skeet shooter
---
Commando / demo expert
---
Tenderizer
---
Gun runner
---
Frog legs
---
Pharma / bloody mess
---
Don't limit yourself by trying to shoehorn NW perks into you ADV build. Make a NW character, the rewards are account based.
---
Sucks being in the wastelands, you need to adapt if you want to survive.  That means planning for all contingencies!
---
(get a crappy shotgun (or a non-crappy one) and put on the enforcer perk when you go SB hunting)
---
Donner and Blitzen, same Radstag :p
---
Rose's quest item, the bait-trap you make with meat and landmines, apparently brings the SBQ down for landing.  Some folks I know have been stocking up on them for just that purpose.
---
Username checks out.
---
They said that you can continue from where you left off
---
I just want the loot table to distribute more evenly.  Duplicate plans are fine and will go in my vendor but the same 3 mounts drop over and over on 75 percent of the gifts I've opened.  Think I'm sitting on 15 ticks, 13 mongrels and 10 deer heads.  It's getting old quickly.
---
I'll take the opposite. Go for the lmg. It's fire rate gives it an insane dps.
---
(If only for 5 seconds until you reload)
---
The 50 cal might do more damage over the course of a minute or two but nothing can outclass the lmg in the first ten seconds.
---
Plasma grenade.  If you‚Äôre on PC, I might have a spare frog head plan to trade if you‚Äôve got the plasma grenade plan.  Have to double check, though.
---
Duping has nothing to do with what level you are.
---
Do you even understand what a duper is?
---
Someone who uses a glitch or a hack to duplicate weapons or armor, which gives you 0XP.
---
It was most likely from the XP glitch that was around when the game 1st came out.
---
Clever
---
Every time you craft anything you gain a little experience and if you are crafting a little of something a lot you gain a lot of experience
---
I'm a ranged build myself, so I haven't tried it.  But I'd be worried it would aggro every glowing thing in the area right to me.  I suppose, that's kind of what a melee character would desire though...
---
Most dupes werent from crafting though.  The used to be able to drop a bag of weapons or armor on the ground and cause the server to crash. When they logged back in they had the stuff in their inventory and the stuff in the bag.
---
 There was also a dupe from the White Springs vendor where you could sell an item to the vendor and all your friends could re buy the item back which in turn duplicated that item.
---
It always really bothered me that there wasn't a suppressor for the smg, but there was one for the combat shotgun AND pump shotgun. I feel like suppressed SMGs were a pretty ubiquitous thing for a while, and would have been an obvious choice. Especially since the long barrels LOOK like they would be suppressed.
---
Just because you're too gullible to understand how Bethesda are robbing you, doesn't mean the rest of us are
---
The fact you could even write all this is staggering. You really are deep into denial territory with this paragraph of nonsense
---
When a flaming sword looks terrifying but it's damage is ass.
---
sounds like you fast traveled to hell
---
I still remember when I first met Grahm. I got scared by a loud voice calling for trade as I ran into Charleston for the first time. And there he was - this big green friendly mutant and his moo moo. I followed him around for at least an hour since I had no caps to speak of to buy anything from him.
---
Do this outside of Fallout 76 and you will get 25k minimum.  
---
Very awesome event though great job!
---
Most likely he got that high from the trap XP glitch that used to be in the game.
---
I‚Äôm a melee as well but I keep a handmade with me for flying creatures and mobs. Should always have a backup
---
If you're sitting on hundreds of flourescent flux + loads of steel and lead, go for LMG... Because you'll be basically spending one flux every 15 seconds or so.
---
You can be killed if you're on a team that becomes hostile to other players - happened to me when I was vending on a level 2 mule and some friends got into PVP.
---
Super Mutants used to give insane xp too. Every West tek trip would get about 1 level. A tse shotgun would take out full groups of lv 68 mutants too lol.
---
You just started. You don't have to worry about mechanics. Just explore the forest and have fun.
---
Knowing that most quest rewards are leveled, i think it's better to complete quests after reaching level 50.
---
Aye I'm hanging onto all of mine in case they ever do it, people will sh*t bricks over those things if they ever do.
---
Lmg/ mg42, for people who complain about ammo its not called hitlers buzzsaw for nothing
---
If you're on PS4, then it could have been me (nick: icbrkr).  That's my standard price and oops.. I didn't lock my Santatron.
---
Then there was the veritbot xp farm. You could spawn in vertibots as fast as you could kill them for a couple hundred xp per kill. Most decent builds could take them down instantly.
---
Drop santatrons at workshops too you'll be swimming in gifts
---
That damage is about correct , my Fixer does 140 , try a Railway if you want higher output
---
That's the point. It's supposed to be a reference to Charlie Brown.
---
Vendor bots at train stations
---
Serendipity doesn't proc while in power armor.
---
Ok thanks
---
For real. I'd be silently setting the world on fire with my Perfect Storm. üòã
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, but thanks anyway! I‚Äôm not sure if the sheet that included the drop rate chance for everything is 100% accurate, but if it is, I believe weapon plans have a higher chance of dropping in small gift boxes. I could have misread it, though! The large gift boxes are better for mounted plans, but if you‚Äôre crafting/buying gift wrap and hoping to get a weapon plan small gift boxes may be the best way to go!!
---
It's weird.  I accidentally sold 17 Technical Data to a vendobot without realizing the "Forbidden Knowledge" quest was still active.  I figured I was screwed but attempted to turn in "nothing" - it still completed the quest!  Go figure . . .
---
I made a junkies melee guy for fun and a more relaxed play style, he still gets lots of dmg, the only thing I really miss with it is the massive stats from unyielding. For guns I would totally stay with bloodied but melee imo is pretty worth it, junkies stealth commando also is pretty decent but why bother when you can be a bloodied one, not gonna be seen anyway most of the time.
---
Okay thank you, I will look for one.
---
I have spares of all MoM gear on both PS4 and Xbox. If you need a sword I can easily spare you one.
---
Maybe I'll try using my "nerf" weapon.  Don't usually try it unless I'm in the Forest region.
---
Thanks will have to do more of those
---
[removed]
---
Thank you
---
So, I'm with you on that part, the problem is that our characters that are in adventure mode are not the ones that are killing each other over and over in NW. Think about it.
---
if you that new,   vendor in the flatwood's church.
---
The most fun times I‚Äôve had on 76 (spanning over 1400hrs) were spent just hanging around with the HOA. Watching them do camp evals and just enjoying the game in the most positive way possible. I‚Äôve built camps in hopes that they would do an eval on them eventually. I can‚Äôt say enough good stuff about them and all the regulars that they hang with. Anyone into 76 should check out their twitch streams to see how they have fun with the game.
---
Nah - I‚Äôm on XB1. But glad I gave you a heads up!!
---
Just because you are disgruntled does not mean that the rest of us are. Some of like the game. $8.99 does kind of suck, however I can afford it. If you can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs your problem. You don‚Äôt have to buy it. You don‚Äôt have to buy atomic points. It seems like the people who want to whine about the game want to ruin it for others. I have probably about 30 ps4 games. Some suck, some were not quite what I wanted, and others are great. There are people who still like Pong. I still play Tony Hawk 2 on my PS3 and I have a PS2 just to still play Manhunt. People have their tastes. How do you think that it feels to have people spend more time bitching about Fo76 than looking for a game that fits their needs. The best that you can come up with is that I am stupid. No one can read my post and come to that conclusion. I am not even a ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù. I just like the game. How stupid is it really to go in day after day and complain about a game you don‚Äôt like? You are just jumping on a band wagon to feel like you are part of a group or movement. That is an indicator of a pretty sad and empty life. Go find a game that you like and I can promise you you won‚Äôt have time to complain so much because you will be having too much time having fun.
---
Oh sorry, I thought you meant he was able to get through the wall. I've just locked mine in behind four walls. :D Well if he can't collect I'll let you know.
---
Yeah, but it would be nice if the thing was bigger. Even in Charlie Brown the tree was bigger, in game it barely comes up to your legs. I just want the models size increases so it‚Äôs a bit bigger and more visible.
---
1. No 2. Yes 3. Dunno 4. Leveling is easy, you'll be fine.
---
Because you're on PC, I would warn you against it. Reason - Hackers/ Dupers whatever you want to call them.
---
Is this the same mask you used to be able to just buy from the Enclave Vendor? Or have I missed something?
---
Prices will relate to your charisma level and optional vendor perks. It may be a good idea to prepare yourself with food, drinks and chems to get the best prices before selling your loot.
---
Note that Bots don't buy ammos, but you can always build a vending machine at your camp and propose the things you want to sell.
---
&gt; I'd say they will have to rebalance all the guns in game, if they want to make things more balanced.
---
They most probably will, even if it involves some unpopular (to owners of currently meta gear and builds) changes, as the downvoting of your comment already shows. First, because a major balance pass coming with Wastelanders was indeed already announced, both after E3 and again at QuakeCon. Second, because to me it is quite apparent that the current not very well implemented balancing of the game is the result of a rushed release, a lot of things were just copied and pasted from Fallout 4, some were rebalanced for the design goals of an online multiplayer game, while others were left unchanged or even broken. Whatever the planned changes are, they are likely mostly already decided, we will see in the next few months once the update is finally released.
---
No you are full of hate because nobody is conforming to your cookie cutter opinion.
---
Are you new here? Honestly the crap your spouting is post launch nonsense. Its like you've never read anything on this sub
---
Some stuff you want to keep. The "Junk" can be scrapped for the most part, then at a Tinkers Workbench you can "Bulk" them and sell the scrap for way more to a vendorbot. Once you get started you'll do more with some of that scrap. Some stuff you want to keep depending on your direction. Me, I like to keep mole teeth :) for crafting purposes of course. 
---
But get rid of your inventory. It piles up fast and caps are pretty important at first. Some train stations already have a tinker's workbench like White Springs but they're pretty rare. 
---
Scrap what weapons you're interested in keeping; sounds weird but you'll learn plans from them if you've got the perk (and inclination) to build. Otherwise, sell'em. You won't get an amazing price without charisma but you can eventually set up your own vendorbot once you have electricity. Price stuff you want to move at want-to-move prices.
---
There's a vendor bot in
---
Train Stations
---
Flatwood Church
---
Camden Park
---
There's one from each faction in the Whitespring Resort
---
There are 2 different vendor areas in the enclave bunker
---
There's a vendor in Harper's Ferry
---
There's also a vendor north of the train station in Watoga
---
Here‚Äôs an opinion, make up your mind and decide for yourself then maybe you‚Äôll actually have your very own opinion instead of relying on others to give you one
---
Cookie cutter option? Shutting up and finding a way to enjoy the game or go away and find another is not cookie cutter.
---
It's because they are releasing them one per day.  You cant see them cause they have not released them all yet.
---
vendorbots or your camp tbh
---
Then that's 3 more people they have to fight.
---
They probably have warehouses full of the crap after people learned that they botched the bottle and that it tastes like cat piss.
---
Dammit why do people have to ruin a game by doing that. I know its probably that feeling of power they get but don't buy a game if you don'y wanna play how its interned. That's a real bummer. :(
---
for 20 dollars id say dive in to the radioactive waters and see how you enjoy the warm glow of your skin afterwards.
---
yes
---
Junkies is really nice if you use heavy weapons and power armor since you miss out on the unyielding armor bonus and perks like serendipity anyway. It also has a lower barrier to entry since it requires fewer perks/mutations/special armor. If you already have everything you need for bloodied and don‚Äôt mind dying then you‚Äôd probably be better off staying bloodied.
---
Great advice....
---
Plus the vendor bot in Flatwoods church. ;)
---
Lol, if anything I'm thinking they'll be like fallout 4, every answer leads into the same thing
---
I couldn't see them yesterday or the day before, and I hadn't done any.
---
If someone is afk, they're not fighting anyone...
---
I want to get off of Mr. Fuzzy's Wild Ride.
---
Brilliant. I just finished that Rose quest and was wondering what the point of it was. I've had 50/50 luck with them coming down but I think I really should have picked up the VATS concentration perk, otherwise you're shooting blanks at their body and not their wings.
---
np. Dont know how I forgot the cultist dagger.  
---
Ised that as a primary from L45 to L60ish.
---
Come on man exclusive rarely means it‚Äôs definition these days. I mean I buy game collectibles all over for cheaper a year after the games been out. You would think collectibles get more expensive, but after a year on GameStop‚Äôs shelf it‚Äôs usually half price. 
---
I get this isn‚Äôt exactly the same, but I bet they have a room full of Nuka Dark and someone wants office space.
---
That is weird cause everyone I know is able to see them starting at 7 pm EST everyday.
---
That is the time they are released each day.
---
I better check my Stash box, I used to have a couple stored, didn't realise they are now so scarce.
---
Near the first "complete" level of the multi-level Treetops colony between Big B's Rest Stop and Camp Venture.
---
Maybe you just need a better gun. My JE railway kills pretty much everything instantly.
---
Usually run sneak commando.
---
If you want to play it and have fun get it on console....Like stated above...PC is broke with all the duping, bugs, mods, cheats and hackers.  What is funny is that they go and do all of this stuff and then complain about the stability and gameplay....That is just funny to me.
---
That's kinda where my mind is at right now. Like 60 would be a risk but 20 feels pretty safe to me. Thanks for the feedback. :)
---
some times they just wont land at all, ranged or melee. The idea is, if you give them enough space........ Nah, makes no difference, they can even come down through the trees. pot luck.   take this bit with a pinch of salt - try turning your back on it , seems to piss them off a little bit more.
---
Not specifically.. but I'd agree it's pretty relevant info. Perks have a pretty big effect on how much damage weapons will do.. and bare arms isn't very clear about what is/ isnt effected..
---
The handmade and fixer have a higher damage output than the combat too. You should have no problem one-shotting lv68 super mutants if you're sneaking.
---
Then all of a sudden the game loads,  and you dressed as mr fuzzy with  20 bodies laying on the ground and a empty shot of daddy-o in ur hand.
---
Ok will try that
---
Hey they want to be afk, then use it as a beacon to trap people and attack them.
---
No do not get it on PC. It‚Äôs horrid, people can spawn stuff in, hackers in PvP and NW. If you want this game, get it on console, that way you can at least enjoy PvP when you complete the 5 hours of content they have.
---
I'd say, yes.  But understand it's not a perfect game.  There are still rough edges.  However, there are some wonderful, brilliant moments as well.  If you loved the Fallout setting and lore, it's really a joy to explore and find things.  The art and writing are top-notch.  It's really weakest when it comes to BTS engine limitations and glitches.  
---
As an aside, if you get in now, you'll still be able to enjoy the absolute sense of devastation and isolation prior to Wastelander's impending debut.  That's the part that I fell in love with in 76.  Unlike other Fallouts where the hero comes in to save the day, here we as the protagonists are more like witnesses to loss and grief.  We Vault Dwellers got on scene just after everyone died, sometimes tragically just days after the opportunity to save them has passed.  It's cathartic and sobering to feel that sense of melancholy.  I really feel like I'm gonna miss that sense of lonely sadness once we start to see living NPC's come back to West Virginia.
---
If I had and extra one I would sell it and make some bank
---
Short barrels are good for Commando, not sniper
---
Alright that's the second to last time I let this happen again
---
Tell that to Liberty Prime.
---
Stole gifts in 2 last night. Got more gifts than I did in my 4 collectors running in workshops for 3 hours. Didn‚Äôt get anything good though but I‚Äôll do it again until this event ends
---
Yes there is duping but that only effects the in game economy and flow of overpowered weapons. Hacking is mostly harmless except in nuclear winter where it it‚Äôs more common. Bethesda it trying to get rid of some bugs unsuccessfuly but they are trying. The community is great and very helpful towards new players. I recommend the game and if you need someone to help you my name is my gamer tag on PC.
---
Two key points to this...And I have done 100s of SBQ fights....Stay off the buildings, tanks, fences and gather in the open space by Dropsite 9......Heavy gunners do not fire on her while she is in the air, there is most definitely a glitch that she will get stunned and not land if she takes heavy gunner fire while she is flying....I go on a private server with 6-8 people, we all just stand there and wait in silence, she lands, she dies, she dies very quickly....also, is you have the right people you can cripple her wings and then she cannot fly back up again...Have a good holiday!!!
---
Weight is everything when it comes to VATS.  Every fraction of a pound saved is an increase in your VATS efficiency and effectiveness.  Short barrels as a rule, do tend to also have better hip-fire, but for me it's a careful balancing act between weight, accuracy, and range; so I tend to pick the lightest most accurate barrels, leaning to Aligned barrels most of the time nowdays.
---
Out of curiosity, how much would you pay for that plasma grenade plan?
---
It is terrible beyond belief. Every single time they patch the game something breaks. You know Power Armor, the iconic armor of the franchise? Yeah that was broken for a few months and there was a 50% chance of your game crashing if you used it. Oh, and then there are the weapon affix bugs like plus damage reduction while reloading that plain dont work. They tried to fix that but it caused reloading any weapon to erase all the stats on your armor!   
---
  
---
Let's see, what else. Random holes in the ground that your character will fall through, laggy "raids" that you will fail because they are on a timer and the server lag makes them impossible. Oh yeah, this week the massive cheats hit and people can spawn whatever they want into the game, even shit from fo4 that has no business even being in the game files. So much duping, dupes everywhere. The in game money is capped at 30,000 but because of all the duping things regularly go for 10 times that if they are sold at all, most people only trade god dupes for other god dupes. 
---
You don't have to worry about catching up because there is nothing to catch up too. There is no endgame. The final boss has actually had it's loot table reduced and it has the same loot as any random dipshit mob you might find by the side of the road. After a year she also will still bug out and just bounce from the map mid fight. Later suckers! The only thing long time players have to do is go around the map looking for rare dresses and other silly crap. 
---
And we can top it off with the actual illegal things they have done. They put things on their Atomic Shop (microtransaction store) "for sale" that had never been on the store before, that is until the law got after them. Then they refused to give refunds for the game until Australian courts deemed that illegal too.   
---
And finally there are the blatant lies. "The shop will be only cosmetic". LIE. They went back on that real quick and now you need a $100 subscription just to get access to some features (not all the features, mind you, those cost more.)  
---
The game was a dumpster fire at launch and it remains a dumpster fire to this day. Save yourself the frustration, the heart ache, and your money by just avoiding this P.O.S. game and greedy Bethesda.
---
Nuclear winter is going to suck total ass man, that game mode is horrific for PC... as for coming in late, i mean it‚Äôs an MMO so there‚Äôs never any sense of late, plus there‚Äôs a new DLC with a slew of shit coming in early next year, so you‚Äôll have enough time to level up till then! The game can be really fun if you invest into it as well :-)
---
Thank you guys for the explenation!
---
So i agree. Invite people to play the game under NDA agreement, let them try to brake it, let Bethesda fix it. Highest expectation should be that this release would be bug and exploit free. Best realistic expectation is it to have only some minor bugs in it that aren't gamebreaking.
---
You follow the BOS like a little puppy. Enclave was a minor part by comparison of how much BOS stuff you have to end up doing/finishing.
---
You aren't alligned with anyone in this game. They are all tools at your disposal. You can't break your alliance because there isn't one.
---
I ran across this: [https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg) and it "scared me sober."
---
Damn that was an absolutely beautiful way of describing the atmosphere of a game. I absolute adore the Fallout universe and lore. I'm gonna take until I get home from work today before I hit the buy button but thank for you giving me a unique description of the game.  :)
---
Wow.  I just like punching mobs in the face.
---
I'm on PC, and BGS has turned me into a bit of a naysayer about the whole situation, so I'm not their biggest fan right now.
---
In spite of that, for $20 I think you'll get your money's worth easily.  The hacking is really only an issue in the pvp arena (which I stay away from), and duping hasn't affected me in the slightest, I haven't seen anything in-game that was related to any of that.
---
If you like the *kind* of game Fallout is, you'll be fine.  It's a bit of a mess, but it's got enough to keep you busy for a long time.  I've got well over 1000 hours in, having spent $40 total on the game, and I definitely got my money's worth.
---
I have issues with the way BGS is driving the game, but it doesn't really impact my ability to have fun in there.
---
I actually just completed some testing on short vs long barrels on my fixer.
---
I use both a commando build, and a rifleman build, depending on my mood, so I wanted to find out what barrel length was best for my rifles for each build. 
---
For most of my testing, I head to westtek, because it does have alot of high level enemies in close proximity that you can take at range.
---
Gun Fu was vital to this test, I wanted to check for accuracy at range with the different barrel lengths.  Concentrated fire was also important as targeting limbs is more accuracy intensive.   I was mainly looking at which functions better for headshots. 
---
I ran both a Powerful Automatic Receiver, and a Hardened receiver (one commando, one rifleman)
---
In conclusion, the short barrel looses so much accuracy its not really viable against enemies farther than 50 feet.  
---
Even for commando builds the long barrel is better.  When your shots miss because the target it just out of optimal range, then you waste ammo, time, and might get dead.
---
Long barrel all the time.  I wouldnt recommend a short barrel for either rifleman or commando.
---
Its weird that I saw this post today, because I was litteraly testing this last night.
---
Mine hasn‚Äôt given me anything yet. But I got 7 from one that I stole from last night.
---
I have been messing around for a bit with the scorched beasts and have noticed u do not need to waste bullet shooting them in the air to get them to land. They land on their own and more frequently if u dont fire on them. Just go to the area where they would normally land or just try to find an open area and stand there and wait and sure enough they land. U can easily try this ur self try doing it with shooting them jump server and do it without. 
---
I feel like u receive more damage from the scorched and what ever else ground enemy is attacking u then the sonic attack from the scorched beasts. I can stand there all day long in PA getting hit by the sonic attack but will get my ass handed to me if swarmed by high level ground enimies. 
---
I do find that some times if u dont engage them while they are flying they will fly off. Im a heavy guns PA build and use a Zealot explosive LMG, i can rip through any high level legendary as soon as they land, normally a clip and a half and they are down.
---
So why are you rocking that flair?
---
If I told you...
---
go thru your options at a w/bench, it will tell you what it does. (mostly). personally, I'd go for range and accuracy, that works, just as well, when close up.What you wont see, is excactly, how much armour it will go thru or how much better your hip fire actually is. They like to keep things a bit vague in that respect.
---
I try to do that when a lot of new players are around but a lot of the time they either don't notice or are too worried they're being tricked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't want to see the plans get deleted when my server inevitably drops, I want them to go to good use. I try to keep my vending machine stocked with common plans at a couple caps a pop, too, but they just aren't moving.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt understand why it can‚Äôt be a mutation. Why should everyone have access to something so overpowered?
---
My idea is to make mutations more of a thing instead of some random in the field bonus you will rarely get unless you keep trying, giving more progress, variety, control, and fun in building your character.
---
To put it short, better make the best use out of them than locking a feature behind sheer luck.
---
Locking them all to the RNGesus so you can try you luck in field knowing someone might be more lucky is meh in competitive game modes, you'd want it to be as not random as possible, but give a little bit of randomness to spice it up, and we already have enough randomness in the game mode such as the content in the crates, the circle's location, and other players' initial placements.
---
&gt;Frog legs is annoying as hell and if you don‚Äôt have enough agility points then you can‚Äôt even have it equipped.
---
The Agility requirement for Frog Legs is exactly a limitation being put, if you want to use it you need to sacrifice other Specials and Perks, it's fair game. If you don't want to sacrifice, you don't deserve the power. If they make other mutations into perks they should also do the same, according to the usefulness of each mutation.
---
Agreed, just don't use team fill if u are just afking. you are ruining it for those who want a full team who actually want to play, not just scrounge the rewards.
---
I'm a melee as primary, but my secondary is heavy gunner.
---
Melee things on the ground, shoot things in the air (ala cargobots and SBs).
---
All the usual melee perks, plus bear arms and stablized to benefit the heavies.
---
I would love to get a suppressor and better sight would be a good weapon and lots of fun, hope they eventually add to it
---
It's a bug with the game as far as I can tell.  It's not constant for most people, but some seem to suffer from it a whole lot.  I've had it happen just a few times.
---
Really, it's not you.  Unless you're running mods or doing something a little dramatic with customization, I wouldn't look at your own system for the solution.
---
Alloying others to make up your mind for you strips value from what you may see and others don‚Äôt. Often times the opinionated have agendas and motives far different from your own
---
Some sights would be nice, and honestly I love the look of the gun
---
Thanks for the speedy reply. Has Bethesda addresses this bug for any future patches? It kind of sucks having to sign out of windows to fix it.
---
Log into nuclear winter, go to challenges, go to character
---
Damn that's such a shame. It sucks seeing a franchise I love having problems. And by the sounds of it those problems aren't bad or even really bad. That sounds like beyond dumpster fire bad. Luckily I have some time before I get home at 5 so I'm gonna be sitting on everyone's thoughts all day before I pull the trigger. But this description right here is confirming a lot of what I've heard. :/
---
To be fair, Bethesda has put ZERO effort into doing anything about it and as of now there are no consequences for cheating. This has been going on for months now.
---
7600 hours is 316 "straight" days... It is t worth it regardless. Be cool if it did have a secret reward but even then.. Still not technically worth it. 7600 √∑ 8 (average work shift) , that would be 950 shifts.. At 7.25 an hour x 8 hours x 950 shifts = $55,100 via minimum wage.. $76,000 if your $10 an hour. Before taxes of course, but I assume no secret unlockable could match the overall time/potential costs.
---
No trust me I know what you're saying. In the end it's going to be my own personal choice of pressing that button or not but I find some value in getting a variety of opinions. But as you said I can't take everything they say as gospel because there will always be some kind of bias.
---
And don't get me started on the actual cost of electricity from afking 7600 hours. In that respect, there should be a better reward because you will have already paid significantly for it.
---
Mr,Fuzzy is your *best* friend
---
Ive been told handmades have a higher chance of plans.
---
For me its meat claw and mole miner gauntlet unless im in PA and its Grognaks axe, they all hit 250 and above with melee perks no chems or food. Get into bloodied and junkie, aide food etc then the damage can be very very high. Everyday use meat hook counts as armed and unarmed so its a good weapon and will kill most anything in a hit or two.
---
Yeah, during one of my encounters I was trying to figure out how I accidentally popped. Berry Mentats...
---
Oh i do as well, i have a couple explosive ones that i dont use because mods are limited
---
set your task manager to always on top, then at least you wont have to sign all the way out of windows
---
I can say I get more plans from handmade but I have opened more large handmades than large ones I have found.
---
I just traded for a B25 one and it is so nice
---
me too, running the stub barrel for the boxy look,  its awesome :-)
---
I don't recall that they've made mention of this bug in particular, but I've learned not to rely on my memory too much :P  Submitting a bug report is always a good idea, and there is periodically a user here who posts a bug tracking list, you could look for that next time it pops up and see if it's included (and suggest it if it's not).
---
The two xmas ones, plus the not yet in the game mounted heads.
---
But....with another 11 days of hunting Santas - will see how it it all ends up.....
---
Me as well. My lvl 1 character opens 15 large handmades every day.
---
Yeah, I love the look of the snub. But I wish it was more functional
---
Do gather the opinon of others. I am bitter and biased because I pre-ordered and I only buy games that have NO non-cosmetic mtx. At release Bethesda promised that is how the game would be and then they started releasing "utility" items to the shop. About a month ago they straight up said that they were ditching that promise and going full on non-cosmetic. I feel lied to and scammed, I think this borders on fraud.   
---
I played the game for a few months after release but, on top of all that I mentioned, the game would crash every 30 minutes and there was nothing to do in the game. I lurk here specifically to warn other of Bethesda's bullshit.  
---
I'm sure others on this sub will tell you the game is the second coming of Christ and that it cured their cancer.
---
Yeah bloodied would be better much higher damage makes it a viable weapon, good trade
---
Yeah, it does something like 240 damage with a firerate of 118 (just guessing from memory) so it has a lot of dps
---
this was my "Go To" melee weapon in Fallout 4 with maxed melee perks i was a dismembered head, home run making machine.
---
I got a quad revolver from a holiday scorched this week. It's surprosingly entertaining to fire off 24 rounds in succession, but the reload time lets me take an entire lunch break between firing.
---
I tried making a pistol build, but the lack of AP is really what kills it. They could just add pistols under the Tank killer perk, and make them much more effective as a build.
---
I've noticed that ignoring them and walking away from the does seem to bring them down quite often.  I will have this happen often as I walk back to Watoga from a SBQ fight to stabilize flux I have gathered after the fight.
---
Yeah but my point is frog legs is the most overused and overpowered perks in the game. It‚Äôs not a sacrifice and more so mandatory if you want to win now. There is no variety and it limits and kills other play styles such as shotgun and melee builds. You can‚Äôt have those without frog legs otherwise frog leg players will always have the upper hand.
---
Yea, they just run around pretending to collect stuff and stuff will be added in after a fixed time. They are not actually collecting.
---
all I want is a red dot and a suppressor, please Santa :-)
---
btw, modded the combat rifle I bought from you the other day to be as compact as possible too, like the look but the recoil is so much better on the 10mm SMG :-)
---
I didn't know you could change the color. Then again I sold mine near launch because I was dumb. Had both masks.
---
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of generals.
---
Hackers are mostly a problem if you want to play Nuclear Winter and diapers only effect the economy.  The issue of both is way blown out of proportion for PVE players in adventure mode.
---
Yeah I can only see the current ones, if I‚Äôm in NW
---
Yeah recoil on combat rifles is really high
---
The mounts were "released" before the sheepsquatch was confirmed real in game.
---
Yeah but im the general of the generals.
---
Plasma Grenade is popping up thanks to the event but once its over it'll be rare.
---
you can now, think it was a patch 14 or 15 "feature" ;-)
---
I use one for tagging in events like uranium fever.  Not enough power to one shot kill, but enough hits to qualify to loot the legendary.
---
would really like to find another suppressed 45 smg.  I had one of those during faschnacht... but but haven't seen one in a good while, and don't have a plan to make another one.
---
Given I have a much larger supply of 45 than I do 10 mm....
---
I wouldnt rely on them too much. They do sometimes work, but sometimes they just don't. And there isnt really any way to tell whats going to be the outcome before you actually try it. 
---
I would recommend getting a limb damage ranged weapon and just breaking the wings instead. I use a shotgun because enforcer is a clear better choice in terms of cripple.
---
Really? Cause I've never heard of you and I'm a general (yes for some stupid reason your robot named modus let a mole be general. You must be desperate)
---
I seem to always get something good out of the handmade gifts.
---
Now with holiday event its a good way to get your early dweller piped out in legendary gear
---
Luckily I'm not too big of a battle royale/pvp guy. I like the whole looting shooting surviving and building aspect of what I've seen.
---
I never envisioned fallout becoming this
---
I have been told people don't like bashing but do like fast aim speed, reduced weight etc.
---
It's not like the previous rewards, you have to complete each one before you can start earning for the next, and they're releasing them 1 per day. After 7PM EST today, you'll be able to earn the 4th, and tomorrow the 5th.
---
yep, best way to get rid of all those .38s though :-)
---
That's cool, they have a bunch respawn inside vault 76 daily or what?
---
Wait serious question, did you use the presents you got from the scorched to get the plasma grenade plan or did you use the presents you have to wrap yourself?
---
thought it was just me having a dafty, but, if I turn to deal with a scorch spawn, good chance it will land behind me. cheers.  need to remember this for tonight.
---
Question: is there any way to team with one or two other people you want to play with and not have the last slot (s) filled with randoms?
---
True but others have been added since then so.
---
That's exactly what I gonna do today. I'm stuck at work until 5 so I'm looking to gather opinions both positive and negative and marinate in them for a little bit before I pull the trigger. And I get where your coming from. Buying a game for $60 bucks and getting burned cause its glitchy is one thing, but being promised one thing (especially when involving money) and doing the complete opposite is it whats pushing me away from buying it the most. Like glitches and bugs I can deal with but borderline-fraud business practices is a major red flag for me.
---
Yes, form a team with your mates via the social menu and turn team fill off.
---
Low level characters take out the possibility of rolling a bunch of armor mods. Making gettinf mounted trophies, plasma mines, and plasma grenades more likely. I farm the wrapping on my alts and they just sell serums for my main for the paper.
---
Luckily PVP/NW does not sound like my cup of tea. I'll probably never touch those modes.
---
As far as I know, the advantage of a short barrel is that it may have better hip fire accuracy, but this does not seem to be consistent between weapons. Strangely, a long barrel is sometimes even lighter. Maybe a short barrel has some hidden advantage not shown by the stats, like shorter time to aim, but that is only speculation. Anyway, for lower AP cost in VATS, aligned barrels are the best, and also aligned or forceful stock (the former gives better accuracy and is lighter, but the latter improves the durability).
---
No, just hiding is an acceptable part of the game. Screwing 3 other people over, just makes them an inconsiderate ass.
---
This is literally dope as hell. I just got the game and was literally just looking for a community and it seems i found a non-toxic community.
---
Yep, I'm approaching 1500 hrs on PC and can confirm that the game is unplayable and not fun. I'll report back after another 500 hrs and let you know if it gets any better.
---
$90, I got the tricentennial edition because I enjoyed fo3, fo4, and Skyrim so much. Learned a valuable lesson about pre-ordering, I can attest to that.
---
I like the cut of your jib! Bethesda did a free trial last weekend but I wish they‚Äôd make a free 7 or 5 day trial permanent, so good folk such as yourself could make up they‚Äôre minds without buying  before pull the trigger
---
Way back during the initial 2 months there were a couple folks seen at 999+.   There was an old exp exploit that some folks went wild with.  Also an invincibility big a couple people had.  Anyways, the point is that there are quite a few older beta players with ridiculous amounts of levels.  
---
Makes me happy to see such things actually.  Some of those saucy ole fellas are my friends!
---
the killing part is easy if there is a timer or not, id prefer an actual challenge overall, but they wont do it, because they dont have any resources they can reuse to make it.
---
Humbug!  I did watch friends on their private conquer the map with bots at every workshop! Epic! I will be doing the same on the weekend.... when work and obligations are less pressing... being an adult is lame
---
You mean a land of crush hopes and dreams üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Its happening to me daily.  Crashes the game.  Havent yet figured it out.
---
I learned that lesson from Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5. THPS 1 was the first game I ever got as a kid. Got it right at Christmas and have been in love with the series ever since. Saw 5 was coming out, pre-ordered it digitally, stayed up until midnight for it to drop and.....never again, NEVER AGAIN!
---
You can use either one, but your chances of getting the plasma grenade plans are slightly better on the ones you wrap yourself.
---
Hmmm sneaky :D
---
You are saying the timer is in the way for doming the more complex stuff in the raid. If you have trouble do it in novice until you learn it,  me and other people went through great difficulty getting out sets of strangler heart power armours, the same challenges you are complaining about. This is the challenge and instead you want it 'easy' or 'a real challenge '
---
Le sigh
---
The Fixer. 
---
Yeah, I know you can get it from Encryptid, but Sheepsquatch hasn‚Äôt given me that one yet!
---
I was looking to try it out that weekend but that's when my parts came in for my new rig so it was out of commission at the time. But luckily I got some time today at work to gather some opinions watch some videos and marinate in it all before I decide. I feel with how gaming is nowadays every game should come with some kind of 24 hour or 12 hour trial. I've been burned by ghost recon and 2k20 this year alone.
---
It just works
---
&gt; The main issue we have now is all the firsters with infinite scrap storage. That is guaranteed to cause latency issues that will only worsen down the road.
---
How?
---
Scrap box is basically I list limited to what 33 items? that has a times X next to them.
---
I decided to use my explosive 10mm as a way to get rid of my 10,000 rounds. It was stupid fun while it lasted.
---
Amazing and a truly accurate description.
---
I would keep the pistol build. It took me to level 60 ish for it to shine. It's a bloodied buil. The two top tier weapons for pistols are pipe revolver and pipe bolt action. Those two pipe weapons double dip into rifleman perk and gunslinger perks. Below is my current set up, I'm going to be removing "crack shot" and trying 3/3 concentrated fire.
---

---
Using exploits. Reported ;)
---
you've been assuming that I haven't been able to do it, I have been doing it, its just neither entertaining or challenging as is. throw another mess of a raid with the same mechanics isnt going to imrpove anything.
---
This is brilliant.
---
So you got yours by sending your presents to your low level mule and then opened them?
---
Doesn't work for the SBQ.
---
Hi there! What's your player ID on PS4 - would love to add you, and visit your camp and go shopping!
---
We let all worthy troops enter our forces(no but seriously we are desperate we are running low on living troops) and also i rule from althe shadows and dont really engage with my army to much. Im usually busy
---
Caps lost are capped at 50 caps tho.
---
So just locking my Santa box is not enough? Also, if someone picks locks in your camp do they get a "wanted" tag?
---
Yesss
---
Have you done expert meltdown and dead in the water? Or at least standard
---
100% agree! Free trials for even 12 hrs would alleviate a lot of the guesswork, heartache and misery that comes from buying bad games
---
Same here. PC. Any consumable.
---
And yet you bother talking to civilians and somehow have still been able to run things from the shadows? I know what its like to sit in the back to observe and rule but i also know that to do that you have to basically not exist. Therefore you either are really bad at it or you're not telling me something.
---
Certainly not the 3 people on the team.
---
You can also cryolator her on the ground and she stays down longer. In my groups,  if she lands,  she's dead in less than 30 seconds.
---
it sure is all about surviving into top 3. i killed 4 in one round but died halfway thru and received less XP than being in 3rd place with no kills.
---
No it isn't. They can pick it and steal, and 6es once you pick a lock you're wanted.
---
Whoa whyd you have to bring the Wii into this?!
---
Wiki doesn't show them as being characters in FO 76.  Anyone else seen them?  Could they be coming in Wastelanders?
---
Im not saying im trying to hide. I dont have to. I can engage with civies willingly. My identity is not secret. So im not trying to not exist. When i say i run things from the shadows i meant i dont really have every member know me and recognize me. Modus already takes care of all the stuff you need to do. So i rather not intervene in an already efficient system
---
Scorchbeasts are just overgrown house flies. Annoying to deal with, perfectly harmless and just a time suck of a nuisance. Most times when I encounter one I just keep on walking, especially if it's legendary. Their combination of harmlessness and annoyance is just maddening. 
---
Now with the holiday event, I'll go to fissure sites and fight Scorched and just ignore the stupid winged beast. Sure it hurts my PA a bit and burns a couple stimpaks, but I save huge stacks of ammo and time. Frankly, I think 90% of my annoyance with Scorchbeasts is that I was already sick and tired of fighting dragons in Skyrim after some 1000 hours in that game... now I have to fight the same fucking enemy but it seems to land even less? Pass, fucking pass.
---
I made 6 gifts. My 2 large gave me 2 bloodbug plans i sh*t you not. The medium were some other mounts i had already. The smalls some other junk. Never will make a gift again.
---
Any links?
---
There are train stations all across Appalachia, each one has a vendor-bot running it, they sell for decent prices, so you should get the hard bargain perk card.
---
I got a Berserkers Automatic Tesla drop from there Purveyor but that prefix is pretty useless.
---
wow...what‚Äôs the max level on 76??
---
Switching weapons means u have to reload even if u did 10 second before then switched weapons, shoot once, then switch back. Its very annoying and is the only reason I usually die in pvp. Those guns u use will always pull the highest charge core to be reloaded. This puts the other one back in your inventory. Only way around it is to use the core up completely before reloading.
---
yeah it looks so cool....
---
I agree from a team standpoint it sucks because having a good team or even shitty one that sticks together at least somewhat increases your odds of a better placement...BUT from the campers standpoint he/she has 3 less people trying to kill them while they patiently hide in fear of death.
---
I have yet to get one. Where‚Äôs my gifts? I‚Äôve tried everything. Stored him, scrapped him and even moved my camp to a completely different location and build from scratch. Nothing works.
---
Yeah, we need a scorchbeast KING!!!   Go back and look at some year old posts on reddit....everyone below level 100 and they are like this bitch will never die!!  I have failed this event every single time, it is so hard!!!  No one is ever going to defeat the SBQ!!!    One year later the event is over in less than 2 minutes....LOL
---
Thankful for this thread, been having this issue for a while. I dropped all mine, bought an extra at a player vendor but couldn't put that in either, so I guess I need to find some and then it will trigger the event so I can add them.
---
Oh good. I'm not the only one thinking modus had a way more efficient system than any human could make. But what i got from this is that you're emperor palpatine.
---
All 12 users?
---
Prime receiver for the Ultracite Gatling laser. I just can‚Äôt seem to get it.
---
Or Mothman mount
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre the same.
---
Move your camp next to them and build sirens to attract enemies.  If they're going to be selfish inconsiderate asshats, you can try to minimize the XP they get, and maybe they'll start turning team fill off.
---
 Some people lie it, but I am not one of them either.  If the other \*s are decent any Tesla is useful for marker mobs at events.
---
This is the correct answer. You won't see them unless you are in nuclear winter,unlike the old ones. 
---
Everyone only have that stupid time answer,we all know that!
---
I was on a private server last night and was lazily playing. I capped 3 workshops, had mine at my camp, and was casually wiping out scorched at Morgantown airport/trainyard, the waterpark, and point pleasant.
---
I was rolling in presents. Hands down the best method for present farming IMO. If I had more time/wasn't as distracted in my playing, I would have capped several more workshops.
---
Mine has a nice view of the crashed space station; looking forward to seeing the map change.
---
had it all the time. still no clue why.
---
I did set iPresentInterval=0 in the .ini, graphics presets to medium and capped frames at 75 with MSI afterburner.
---
no issues since but everything could only be a coincidence with the last patch :/
---
Take it all, leave some fertilizer and toilet paper if you want to be funny or spoiled meat but it will likely either disappear or say someone has taken it, it's a little buggy
---
I saw someone selling the Santa crash plan for 5,000 caps, and mothman for 10,000. How do they come out with those outrageous prices? It‚Äôs Christmas for christs sake
---
Yeah i knew that i have to empty it before reload. But what happens a lot is, i used my ts-e one to farm, but when the mobs manage to get to close, i have to switch or my own gun will kill me instantly. And when i switch back the gun is empty or has a completely different core in it lol it‚Äôs strange.
---
I know what I'm doing this weekend!
---
Yeah and the folks at Anchor Farm are clearly outside as well, so ... maybe it drops you to a cutscene-like interface.  I've been playing 76 so long I've practically forgotten how the other games handled dialogue.
---
I posted an update, I figured it out. Too many weightless items in my pip boy inventory were crashing my game when I tried to craft anything. Like holotapes, notes, anything with 0 weight. Just for example I had 248 government requisition tapes and almost 300 propaganda fliers, multiply copies of the same note.
---
Yep.  Then once I got the plans I sent them back to my high level primary.  A lot of people have commented that this shouldn't work, that various plans aren't level locked, etc.  But it worked for me.  And since I made this post I have seen other people comment on other threads that it worked for them as well.
---
*Yule shoot you're eye out, kid. FTFY (this comedic misspelling is brought to you by Fallout Boys song of the same name)
---
Ah yes,
---
My main: No lore, nothing special, it‚Äôs just a AA commando I use for PvP
---
My Pirate: I have a pirate character for role play which I haven‚Äôt done a lot lately with, I guess it‚Äôs a  rifleman
---
Rudolph: Not finished, but has a purple glow created by all his frogs, he has over half his stash space used by nothing but frogs, why? I don‚Äôt know, I just did it. He‚Äôs a junkie, because again, why the fuck not?
---
Brenda: barely started, but is meant to be a paddle ball build, yes, a paddle ball build.
---
Denny: Not started, but made. I have no plans for him currently other than him looking like Benny from NV, having a pistol named Marge, and a Denny‚Äôs Camp.
---
Pretty sure there will be factions released if and when Wastelanders releases.
---
How so?
---
The enclave also thought about releasing the monsters into Appalachia.
---
I agree about the donations though. Merry Christmas!
---
HaHaHa, or should I say Ho-Ho-Ho :D
---
Totally dosent feel bad from all the purging.. not at all..
---
Merry christmas
---
Just use a fixer or put a suppressor on a .308 hunting/sniper rifle
---
I watched someone in the act picking my lock. Scrapped Santatron.
---
It feels like an artificial way to start drama, and I'm just gonna check out of that whole side of the event because of it. Selling all of the plans that come out of it for 20 caps each and its got to the point to where I just dump whatever presents I find in the world in a trash bin.
---
I'm a 1st stage Grinch. I'd rather not participate at all.
---
That's nearly as bad as you can get. Scrip it, no one will even buy that unless it's cheap enough for them to scrip it themselves
---
But for people who don't really care about NW and are just doing it for the rewards. Joining a group is a far better option.
---
  Kind of the developers fault for putting adventure mode rewards in a mode not everybody likes.
---
 I can't stand that mode long enough to even get the rewards.
---
I've seen a lot of posts about trap vending machines....just might have to build a nasty little surprise on my Santatron for would be thieves
---
Build locked doorways, then put concrete barricades behind them lmao turn on pacifist and profit lmao they get a bounty but can't get in hahaha.
---
Xbox it started doing it when I was server hopping for daily challenges
---
You don't try to hide but most people have never met you. Just like palpatine. You control everything (or at least try). Just like palpatine. And I'll bet you have a bunch of contingency plans that you keep a secret from most people. Just like palpatine.
---
I have a TSE -15% VATS Cost Revolver (I think it was the .44 revolver) in my vendor for 4k caps. I would go down with my price for you if you can wait until sunday when I'm back at home. That should help you out a lot even if it's not the very best pistol option available.
---
It's max level tho so you would need to wait until level 50 to use it.
---
Happens to me on Xbox
---
Thanks, I actually posted an update, pretty sure I figured it out. I had a lot of items in my pip boy with 0 weight value, like duplicates of the same
---
note, holotape, propaganda fliers, and it seems like these weightless items were crashing the game when I tried to create an item. I assume the game was crashing trying to load my pip boy inventory. Maybe it‚Äôs just news to me but weightless items crash your game if you have a lot of them when trying to craft an item.
---
How big is your friend list?
---
I'll be on later tonight.  I'll send you a message. What's your GT?
---
Arcadiouse.
---
ok no problem
---
It's under floor items in camp build
---
A while back, I did that and when I spawned in I could still play but the Mr. Fuzzy music is blasting everywhere.
---
I was a melee character and it was a weird build and I was in level 76 when I got my first bloodied handmade and I fixed my build. I took me a lot of levels, switching from strenght to perception was rough but I did it for 2 reasons: My character already knew a lot of plans and I'm too lazy to start over.
---
I think the plague is evolving and starting to affect robots.
---

---
Thanks for clarifying! I was wondering why my TS-E Gatling Laser kills me in seconds when a mob gets too close. I traded 2 unyeilding pieces for it on fo76 reddit discord :) i even tried fireproof and adamantium skeleton, while in power armor. I just shred myself lol.
---
With your explination, this makes sense lol
---
Thirst and hunger for sure. Haven't noticed weapons yet.
---
Thanks. I will ask my teammates to do that when joining their matches.
---
 Mine sure don't. Its a console, right?
---
Hmm. I do kinda seem like him. Well sure i guess im like palpatine. Go with that
---
It's the same model but it's not from the NCR as it hasn't been formed at this point in the timeline.
---
The armor the NCR uses is from pre war and was used all across america.
---
The one in the game is from the Charleston Police Department.
---
I sell a lot of ammo and weapons. I get 1 cap for 1 round of ammo. Regardless of the caliber.  The only difference is if it is ultracite ammo. Then its 2 caps for one round of ammo. Also 5.56 ammo is used as a form of currency in game.  So one round of 5.56 is equal to one cap.  I have done business with several individuals in game that will only except 5.56 for payments.
---
dont sell explosive ammo at all (mini nukes/missiles/40mm) they are way to heavy and boone uses them
---
try to focus on 5.56, 45, .50, 308, fusioun cells, shotgun shells and 10mm for 1cap each
---
things like flamer fuel plasma cartridges or cryo cells could potentially sell for 2 caps each
---
I recognize you from my other post - you are a font of information!
---
they werent for her. She lost 50% of her caps. So, glitch? Hacker maybe? I dunno, he deliberately didnt attack me and went after her after that over and over, maybe because he made caps off her in one big fell swoop. but i goo-ified him 3x, and only got 50 caps myself. &gt;:C
---
What should I do about missles lol? I am maling a fatman build also
---
A third party site?
---
Yeah, I make sure it works before I send it out, I don't hand it in broken.
---
[Proof! ](https://i.imgur.com/HU2Rgfr.jpg)
---
The rest? You're in the minority completely
---
Don't act like fallout 76 has some silent community, it doesn't. This game is a joke and has been since launch.  I say that as a player and someone who put alot of effort into this thinking it will improve. It has barely changed since launch then I get a subscription shoved in my face
---
Enjoy the game all you want but don't sit behind your screen acting like the people aren't justified in their reactions. You are completely in the wrong and if you self reflected on those downvotes you're getting, you'd probably understand
---
Good find but we've all known. There's a list and chart of everything that drops from presents around somewhere.
---
The only "ammo" that I sell higher than 1-2 caps is Fusion Cores and Plasma Cores. 1 cap per 2%, so a full core is 50 caps. Generally don't sell anything under 80%.
---
Well then I'm just bragging. My bad!
---
prepare to be let down!
---
(i only did mine to complete the challenge and flex on people)
---
well theres enough players that you will sooner or later find someone who uses a fatman or a missile launcher but it could take weeks before one of them takes a look at your vendor and then they wouldnt pay more than maybe 10caps for a missile or a mininuke
---
its just not viable to sell those pretty much anyone drops these ammotypes the moment they recieve them
---
if you have the stashspace id suggest you put some missiles and mininukes in your vendor for free and you will see what im talking about üòÖ
---
No worries. I took me hundreds of presents to finally get one.   Ever since the Pioneer scouts was released I've been trying to get that plan.
---
People are justified in not being happy. If one were to be objective one would see that the arguments are well formed. The best way to protest something is to do it with style. Have it organized, and not sound like a child throwing a temper tantrum. It makes it more respectable.
---
I'm missing 4 of the mounted heads. I've gotten about 40 of the other ones so far. 
---
I'm starting to wonder if some of them are actually in the loot table at all at this point.
---
There needs to be \*something\* in the ballroom, there's so much empty space in the Whitespring with literally nothing to do there. It would be really great to have the community actually use this space for an activity. Even if there were no official events from BGS.
---
Plus I don‚Äôt just sit behind a screen... Actually I sit behind 2 screens as I have a multiple system setup. :)
---
Thank you so much for all the tips!!
---
They come in any size gift. I got mine from my 2nd gift and it was a small one. Guessing I was really lucky that day because the smalls have given me mostly  crap since then. Lol
---
We don't know that's what's happening though. The NPCs could very well be worked into the start of game story without altering it too drastically.
---
You're in for an emotional rollecoaster.
---
I got an automatic tesla rifle from abbies bunker floor safe.  Level 3 lockpick.
---
The only good thing about it is the furious part. The flamer isn't exactly a weapon you need to aim and bashing with a gun goes against the entire concept of ranged weapons
---
Amazing lol i renounced at 354 ü§£
---
Nice well done!
---
Yep and they "compensate" executives at the tune of 140,000 a year while creating revenue after all said and done of over 100000 a year in their pocket.  
---

---
Exactly! Like a board game and some coal. Make up your mind, Santa!
---
I broke mine by drinking 3 nuke shines back to back
---
That somehow matters? 
---
If CAMP building changes, it could be nice for new players. 
---
It could also be that camp building guidance isn't all that the NPC does...
---
Good to know!  Thanks for the info.
---
I can't imagine that the inclusion of a small handful of early game NPCs would have to alter the early game experience drastically.
---
Sounds like that's the move, then.
---
How low is considered low? Because my level 23 got the plasma grenade on his second gift. It was a small one too.
---
Lol. Modus is vader thenüòÇ
---
Lvl5 or below has less armor mods available. You can get plasma grenade plan at any level. But opening them on a low level has a smaller loot table. Meaning a higher chance fornit to drop.
---
I get that, but he specifically said that the guy went to his workbench and made a new one.
---
You sure about that?  It's not a guarantee, but I swear I've seen them deployed and work.
---
Ya they reintroduced the trap disarm glitch a few patches ago. 
---
More people knew about it and it took a few days for a hot fix so a lot of people were abusing the hell out of it.
---
I've got 3 plasma grenade plans so far :D
---
Amazing, they are so beautiful.
---
I'm specing out a midrange VATS blaster.  I was able to get a decent deal on a 3\* radium rifle which I'll pay someone else to mod out: Anti Armor, Faster Fire Rate, 15% faster crit.  The mods are so rare (read:broken) that the wiki doesn't have accurate infor.
---
Sometimes it's not just about the DPS.  I always carry one of my cryolators to CC the queen, either as she's hovering above the field or on the ground.  It's a turkey shoot for everyone else, and I almost always get thanks for setting up a successful kill.
---
Na this is most likely the trap disarm glitch that was around for a while. That‚Äôs how players got to super high levels. 
---
You could set up a macro and have your character get continuous XP without playing.
---
See? It's fun being a raider, isnt it? That's how it starts. Lol
---
I love this! I always thought that would be such a great place to just gather a bunch of friends and shoot the shit... Wasted potential.
---
Nice
---
There's no max level (well, or maybe there's a max level and  it's 9999, but you understand me)
---
I've had this issue for a long time. If you can put the aid items on your hotwheel instead that seems to work. Otherwise wait a second or so after you open your inventory before using any aid items. I have issues using the repair kits from the SBQ on weapons. If I hit inspect and try to repair it immediately it regularly freezes my game.
---
If you were in xb1, I'd volunteer to jump off my camp at the monorail.
---
Lmfao I love that one cartman shitting into a bed pan his mom's holding
---
Got one spam opening small gifts. How much is it worth because someone told me they would give me 200 caps but other people say 12k and even 20k?
---
yeah had somebody like that yesterday, had just deposited technical data again and noticed somebody at my camp suddenly becoming wanted
---
Before I could even click to FT they were gone from that world and the collector lockpicked
---
Indeed
---
This happens to me all the time. However, I changed the view on my pip boy and so far no crashes.
---
A Bloodied FSS Guitar Sword w/+1 STR or AGI would be pretty sweet.
---
Maybe try something past highschool programing.
---
Fusion core combinator in the atom shop for 7000 atoms, probably.
---
I love it when the community does stuff like this
---
Heavy Weapons work well with a Melee build, I use a primed bloodied .50 and Bloodied DCG, solid combo vs SQB imo.
---
Yep, sometimes Im just scrolling through them, not even getting the chance to click.
---
Maybe my server sucked but only got 2 gifts. The one in my camp has yet to give me a gift during this event.
---
I just bought the drum magazine for my top level storm.
---
I wish I had a dot sight for it aswell as a surpressor as I‚Äôm using it as I have around 2k 10mm ammo to use up as I‚Äôm running out of .38 for when I do a run through Morgan town for the holiday scorched and I really don‚Äôt want to waste resources to make .38 ammo.
---
Good on you dude. No doubt higher levels will take it to sell.
---
Private server?  
---
When the event started i tried it on public and private servers and found the odds and spawn rates were equal for me. Because of this I just kept running in private servers. After a few days I just keep seeing less and less of them and the drops I got from presents just sucked.  Got to the point I was fed up with grinding the event and went back to public servers hoping for a nuke or something.
---
  The second I hit a public server I had about 8 gifts after 15 minutes.  On top of that instead of getting the same couple of mount plans over and over , I got a plasma grenade plan, some dense plans and some PA plans.  I've been sticking to public now and have gotten a lot of drops since.   Could just be a weird coincidence though I guess.
---
Just two gifts. I got about 10 in the 2 collectors I robbed. I see myself as a selfish Robin Hood of the wasteland.
---
They said NPCs will be throughout. I just don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm hearing.
---
Same as many fps games :P you're right to ask the custom line tho.
---
im right behind you at 97
---
It matters that they are getting rid of the original storyline of walking out and everyone is dead. Yes.
---
By bloodied armor you mean unyielding right? Just to spell it out for people who dont know.
---
LOL
---
It completely changes the premise of the game.
---
I am not an executive, neither is any of those participating in this event. The Wastelands Estates Homeowners Association. You have issues with the foundations high ups that's fine but please don't take away from those that have put effort into trying to raise money for a good cause. They are spending their time to do this. Any awareness that's brought about &amp; any little bit of money raise that goes towards helping children with cancer is a worth it
---
It said no intoxicated riders at any time, but you went anyway.
---
Your punishment? **Purgatory**
---
You should use grape mentats instead of x-cell, gives you +5 charisma and "better buying/selling prices"
---
Multiple accounts. My computer can run 2 instances of the game well, and I can have one account sit idle while I play the other. Id wager some people could do it with more accounts.
---
Oops, yes, my bad!!
---
I hope they introduce cross-platform between xbox and playstation
---
I always forget about those. Good point!
---
Congrats...I think?  Your post makes it sound like you're proud of your achienvement, although you really didn't have it set up as a goal in the first place.  So I'm not sure how you feel???
---
From my (pessimist) perspective, level 100 just means you now need three times as much XP to reach subsequent levels (so I hope you have your perk points assigned where you want them.)  But I do understand its a big deal the first time it happens.  So, honestly, congratulations, and I'm glad you find the game fun!
---
Queen fights give some nice rewards, Stable flux, Improved repair its and 2 2 legendaries is not a bad haul.  Legendary SBs are ok, but regular ones are not worth my time.
---
You can idle while playing an instrument indefinitely. I do it sometimes while I play on another account to keep it logged in. I use it's camp for my lower level account.
---
That would also be nice!
---
Add dixiemomma1577. I‚Äôll take a dive off a bridge for you. I‚Äôll be on in about 6 hours or most of the weekend
---
What didn‚Äôt you like before?
---
That would be more impressive if level had meaning at that point. Once you hit ~100 and have your build set, level becomes irrelevant.
---
Flamer isn't THAT ranged :P if he wants to build a medic for whatever reason it could be useful
---
They're not removing nukes.  All the important NPCs will probably be in instanced locations that won't be affected by nukes.
---
Well I did but I became very bored with the game and the glitches that still hasn‚Äôt been fixed plus the Fallout 1st subscription being announced pushed me over the edge.
---
I've noticed a difference myself with lack of Action Girl, so it's definitely proven itself for me, but I'm a heavy VATS user. Lone Wanderer is more about the damage resistance for me as well, as I get enough AP refresh from Action Girl.
---
Not much has changed since then.  I'd wait until Wastelanders if you're frustrated with the game in its current state.
---
That's a possibility but it'll still be strange to go to a nuke zone, enter a door in a wooden shack and be right as rain inside.
---
Regardless it'll be interesting to see how they handle it.
---
Is this with or without the perk ‚Äúhard bargain‚Äù ? Because with that equipped alone gets me to 1500 &amp; I‚Äôm not really that fussed about 100 cap difference
---
The mechanics for this are already in the game for the event at the golf course setting up the dinner party.
---
Surely it wouldn‚Äôt take much to implement this using items already available in the game?
---
i have no issues with the execs or the higher ups, i know nothing about them.  someone had questioned the validity of the organization so i produced some information to make sure that informed decisions can be made.  there have been a few stories about popular charities and their mismanagement of funds and high rates of pay for their execs, but i never said this was one of them nor did i speak negatively about them of their financial practices.
---
It is definitely worth 12-20k. Do not sell it for 200 caps.
---
Anyone who cares is past 200 already, your accomplishments mean nothing.
---
Well, the forest has a safe zone so I'm sure they could make other areas safe too.
---
Maybe at some point in the story you end up nuking a faction or sub faction
---
I started yet another mule and have spec‚Äôd it out just for NW. my main character is heavy guns and that‚Äôs not a good choice for NW so I build a multi purpose build leaning more towards Auto Rifles. If you plan on play a while then you‚Äôll need a mule at some point so build one just for NW. problem solved.
---
Uranium fever is a good event to get it, plus the legendaries.
---
It‚Äôs a Charlie Brown tree, how can you not like it?
---
It's not that simple, I'm level 35 in nuclear winter and its not worth going through those levels again. I'd rather wait
---
Do they think the suppressor and reflex dot would make it overpowered for its fire rate?  I have no idea.  Seems the 10mmSMG would have a suppressor long before a pump action shotgun.
---
I too love the 10mm SMG and have many of them, mostly bloodied.  Don't know why, but I buy them whenever I come across one for under 1K.  And, I too am hopefull for a suppressor and reflex dot sight.  With those mods I would run this gun as an everyday weapon.
---
The most relevant number would be what percentage of a dollar actually makes it to the kids.   Most charities have abysmally low numbers from what I understand.
---
I used to be handmade explosive, but now I'm lever action explosive. Has a nicer feel.
---
i think the NW tree is in reference to the peanuts Christmas tree 
---

---
I dont really think of it as "joining" the factions becasue the main quest makes you go thru every faction from responder to raiders to free states to BOS to enclave so you're not really beholden to any of them.
---
Can you get that from this event? If so I‚Äôm going on a scorched killing spree tonight and robbing every santatron I come across
---
I like the look of short barrels, so I was hoping they'd be more mechanically viable.  Alas, doesn't seem to be the case.
---
I‚Äôm lucky there was another guy in my Xbox party that heard the offer and said . I was with a bunch of people I was farming gifts with. I just bought the game on sale but I am level 150 from playing it when it‚Äôs free and renting it occasionally.
---
Too many good bonus that unarmed benefits.
---
Brotherhood would lock themselves in their bunker.
---
We got free gifts!!!
---
Ill keep that in mind, i was looking through old posts and saw that levers actions are more of snipers and handmade are better up close, would having 1 of each also be a viable build?
---
I suspect you are correct.  That and a "more is more" design attitude.
---
according to their most recent tax info 98.7% of total revenue. 17% of expences are to exec and 16 are other wages and salaries.  not too bad really
---
That is true. Good idea, I might do that.
---
I hope you do end up giving it a try. It has it's fair share of rough waters but it's not as bad as it's been made out to be.
---
What is a spot light
---
Hi.  I did the same thing.  I quit 8 months ago, right before a bunch of really cool stuff dropped.  Heh.
---
Started playing again because I saw something about NPCs and thought ??
---
So...I came back and...
---
Well, to start, my shotgun character that used to be a delight to play (except for the plastic) now SUCKS.  Shotguns got horribly nerfed.
---
And I'm having trouble with all sorts of new bugs- frequently when I attack nothing lands, and the mobs can attack me with impunity.
---
Nevertheless, I'm having fun with the game.  I'd honestly suggest you pop in.  For one thing there's a holiday event going on that's really fun and you'll be annoyed if you miss it.
---
Additionally, player vending is really neat, which might help you get some cool weapons and armor, or help you sell excess stimpacks.
---
You might consider starting a new character...unless you remember exactly what you were going for in perks.  if you do, you're all set.  Just pop in and see.  No, the game hasn't been fixed.  It's still a complete clusterfuck.  There are bugs that should have been fixed ages ago...
---
But there's some neat new stuff too!
---
Am I supposed to be looking after my scrap Santa thing while I‚Äôm online or something?
---
I only use hard bargain 3 and it gets the price down to 8 caps more, so your only saving 8 caps for all that extra work, I'm just just gonna farm the presents
---
I am glad they saved you from losing out on those caps. I am glad you seem to be enjoying it tho! The free weekend was really great for leveling.
---
But it is that simple, I did it. Now my NW build is a 190 and he‚Äôs only a 135 in ad mode. Didn‚Äôt take me long at all to get there. Only reason he‚Äôs 135 in ad mode is double xp weekends and I play with my squad a LOT. It‚Äôs all on how you look at it. It was well worth it to me and I may do it again durning the next double xp weekend just for a melee build. Good luck.
---
I usually drink some nukashine' to expand the mind and pass out while playing an instrument. So, I don't drink from bowls unless I see the camp has an instrument. 
---
I am not an addict. I just need inspiration. Nuka calls the muse...
---
It depends if you want to use automatic fire or single shot. 
---
I've used both a lot and for me I prefer the lever action for single shot and I use a handmade for auto fire. 
---
One thing to keep in mind is time to kill. Your time to kill something can be slower using single shot. I find using vats helps a lot with single shot and can make you pretty powerful but if you get overrun by a grouping of enemies having a commando build for auto fire would outperform a rifleman build with single shot. 
---
If you're stealthy and have the right setup you can sneak through places like westek and one shot everything with a rifleman build. 
---
I would try both out for a bit and see which one you like more.
---
Tell that to liberty prime and see if you say that before getting blasted, oh wait, you can't you were destroyed in fallout 3 HaHaHa
---
Always remember to sell your things to the robot before you buy from the robot - that way you can still get more caps out of them later.
---
If you only left two months ago, no much had changed.
---
Yep, exactly. Can't have people thinking the lore is screwed üòÇ
---
Pretty sure the higher tier have an increased drop rate of higher level jackpots. (Caps and scripts mostly)
---
Rudolph the Red Nosed Radstag,
---
Has a very lethal glow.
---
And if you ever find him,
---
You can watch your rad count grow.
---
All of the Blue Vault Dwellers,
---
Shoot him when he comes to play.
---
They'll never let poor Rudolph.
---
Irradiate the day away!
---
They work. I have tested it. However, Enforcer and a shotgun work better.
---
Fixed it for ya, as reply to first song.
---
So only %33 is going to administration?
---
The small, medium, and large ones have better rewards, but not the handmade or regulars.
---
No, there isn‚Äôt a difference on their status
---
I‚Äôm sorry the glass is always half empty for you
---
it didn't kick off until 12am gmt so I thought it wasn't happening until the first one was unlocked.  only need 1xp so was able to realise it had begun
---
This would be such a fun event. Because there's definitely been a datamine of new years style outfits coming soon. I have a gut feeling that they will 99% be in the atom shop but a New Years small event would be so much fun. They already have the mechanics from Fasnacht and Campfire Tales. Great ideas here OP.
---
Wait, the Enclave didn't put the chip in your head?
---
Yeah, but if it was just a bit bigger it‚Äôd be reasonable.
---
Nah it's not life or death of spending that $20. There is just a bunch of games on sale right now and if the game was horrible and there was a more obvious choice out there I just don't want to miss that opportunity. Just like to see what the general consensus is a year after launch.
---
Why a TSE specifically? The damage numbers for a TS don't tell the full story. In any case, I used to run around with a TSE lever action and it was pretty great. It's pretty accurate while aiming and hip fire wasn't all that bad either. The main problems it has are the slow rate of fire and the beating it takes in condition, especially if you get mobbed. I finally got a TSE handmade, which I was hoping I would like a lot better, but the accuracy seemed worse than the lever  , no matter what the situation (others will disagree with this). Simply put, I was missing to much to take advantage of the theoretical dps boost it was supposed to provide. Luckily, I got a AAE version in the same trade, and that I really like. I also have a two star Executioner's Fixer (basically a one star; the other star is meh) which I also like better than the TSE handmade. Stays in better condition, and due to the sneak buffs and rate of fire, it takes most things down fast, except for really tanky enemies, like the sheepsquatch.
---
I always found that the handmade clip capacity is pretty small
---
Never mind I see it‚Äôs not possible üôÑ
---
I always wanted for vending machines to be "forced" to exist as specific places. Like the Galleria, Whitesprings, Top of the World. Like, you set your shop there and people are forced to interact in this common, battle free zone of commerce. 
---
Sure, having them at your camp is comfortable and convenient, but not 'good' enough to deliver a vibe of trade and market.
---
Very kind of you! I actually have the weapon, but I‚Äôm grinding for the plan. That way I have a (very small) chance of rolling a legendary version from Murmphfg (or whatever her name is)!
---
Did you get unlock the previous one, and have you gotten 750 xp in NW to u lock the 3rd reward? I got my x-mas tree reward last night.
---
Legendary pairing possibilities are not unlimited. Quad and two shot are both primary affixes; they both go in the first-slot. Explosive is the second affix, so you can have a QE or TSE but not QTS.
---
For $20 bucks I am currently leaning towards snagging it. Still got till the end of the day to decide, but from what it sounds like, it seems that there is glitches and bugs (as expected) but a more major problem with hackers effecting pvp and Nw. I don't plan on doing much if any NW and PVP so it might be good for a player like me for only $60.
---
I‚Äôve heard that The Fixer Plan is a rare drop from Large Holiday Gifts, but can‚Äôt confirm this.
---
Well then QE would be decent as well
---
I have learned over time how to maximum how I lay down my circuits and to use conduits as much as possible because they take up less budget than standard wiring.  Best way is to start at the generator, and lay down two paths; one for normal stuff, and one for peripherals like turrets and spotlights that you want to have a means of turning on and off.
---
I use an Instigating / Instigating Explosive Lever  and a Furious explosive handmade pretty much exclusively
---
Just swap rifleman and commando perks as needed
---
Not exactly I think there is some truth to it
---
Yeah there's been issues with that on PC sadly. Hopefully it will be addressed soon but you'll want to play the base game first anyway before you jump into nuclear winter - because their perks are based off how your points are set up in adventure - so you might want to have a character specifically for NW anyway. Yeah and 20$ is a great price. I bought it at 80$ for the Tricentennial (the skins were not worth imo tho in the end) and I've got about 1200 hours in since Beta. It's a fun game. I hope you will enjoy it.
---
You want a Fixer modded to shot 10mm with special sights. I like the SMG precisely because it feels different, more guerilla, more dirty and noisy. 
---
My main has three of them. In fact, my silo gun happens to be a troubleshooter explosive +1 per SMG.
---
agreed.  did not like having to join the enclave or BOS, but really no choice, or consequence
---
Sinseer.com
---
PS4? Add me and I will build it at your place. Andreslamantis.
---
I like the NW tree more than Atomic Shop ones. At least it looks post apocalyptic :D
---
But then he would need a medics flamer...
---
I think its closer to 2x for 100+ compared to 50-100 isnt it? 7880 compared to 15880.
---
Higher the level, more experience is needed to level up.  
---
I'm over level 300 with my main and I rarely level up..  
---
Level 1000+? There have been so many exploits to level up fast...  
---
I do a lot of PvP, so it's my personal quest to beat my record.
---
Oh... I didn't know people could take stuff from them, I assumed you talked to them and they gave you the items or it was supposed to go to stash. I've never gotten a gift so now I know why...
---
I always thought explosive bait would get her down?
---
And the thickness of your skin in seeing nuns run to it and ruin it constantly.
---
thanks for that. still....a hell if a lot of grinding especially with holiday scorched event too
---
Logically you should be able to take one from the pistol and use it on the SMG. Same round and all.
---
Try not setting those plans at 20+k...they might actually sell then.
---
Wtf do you expect?   Rare =/= everyone willing to spend max caps on it, esp when it‚Äôs just a gun plan for stealthy bois.
---
puts up a &lt;no enclave allowed &gt; sign in watoga
---
Yeah I feel your pain. I have 4 characters 2 weapon mules and 1 armor mule and 1  aid mule.  I could use one more for weapons.
---
How do I get in on the singing? I don't have much money, (and certainly none to spare these days) but I know a lot of Christmas carols and would love to help sing to people on Xbox!
---
I also have my main character.
---
There are many trophies and achievements tied to the nuke quests. They would have to rework them if removed.
---
I know right a nukashine power fist that explodes when you hit something and makes everyone around it hallucinate would be awesome
---
Never tried that, I‚Äôll give it a go
---
I‚Äôd buy at 5-6k, but not 10, just to play around with the guns on my alts.  Not so sure about others.
---
It does. Keep in mind super duper does not though
---
My pistol build got a Executioner's Explosive Pipe Pistol from a friend. With hair trigger receiver, my fire rate is 90 with a semi-auto pistol (yes, faster than an automatic handmade). It's my best gun. (Breaks REAL fast though)   
---
:)
---
Good for you? You need the plan to learn and craft the gun to get legendary drops. It's worth what people will sell it to you for.
---
Could be the regular scorch beasts works, but the Queen, it might not. Just a thought
---
Learn to read dude.
---
These devs can barely bring 50% effort into this mess, do not expect 110%.
---
&gt; The Soviet Union collapsed well before the Great War.
---
No it didn't it existed right up until the Great War.  There are even characters in the first Fallout who are descendants from people who worked in a Soviet consulate in Los Angeles.
---
The lore implies they pursued a policy of isolationism because they were incredibly resource rich (via Siberia) and had no need to participate in the world's resource wars.  And they were always at odds with both the US (for ideological reasons) and China (because China coveted Siberia and the USSR's resources), so they weren't friends with either of them, but not exactly overt foes with them either and thus were unaligned in the run up to the Great War.
---
Everything beyond the Great War is just like Europe, conjecture because the lore has never elaborated.
---
I ran into a guy on PS4 that was over 1080, I wish I could remember who that was. He bought some event plans from me.
---
Welcome to bethesda.
---
I actually wasn‚Äôt planning on using the spotlights at all but had a tiny bit of build budget left (enough for 2 spotlights) and I really like the way they look on the front of the greenhouse domes.
---
.. And then said another settlement needs our help.
---
Depends on what you really want.  I have many handmades  with different perks.  My favorite is my anti armor explosive +1 strength.  The anti armor faster fire rate +1 agility isn't bad either.  I also have a two shot explosive handmade.
---
That‚Äôs actually not the case in the lore. The USSR just became less of a threat and was having an improvement of diplomatic relations with the US. China began to rise more prominently, and by the time of the Great War, even the USSR had concerns about China.
---
Essentially, they became a minor player overall. But they hadn‚Äôt actually collapsed.
---
Exact same for me. And I have an Instigating FFR Fixer that lets me 1-shot basic enemies (sharing .45 ammo with the Lever comes in handy).  I really only use my Handmade for crowd control and fighting the Sheepsquash.
---
I hate that mission. They need to remove it. I see an event pop-up, get excited, oh.. just project paradise..
---
Also didn‚Äôt realize conduits were better for budget, since they are actual physical models I figured they‚Äôd take up more. Thanks for that tip.
---
Damage vs equal level mobs at early levels does NOT need more than a tweaked double damage sneak shot to kill anything but the top end bads.
---
&gt; you really should think about locking your Santatron! You **had** two small and one large holiday gift in there.
---
So it was *you*.
---
Just kidding but it's really important, I left mine unlocked because no one stole from it before, and I didn't care much. First time I checked it after the update though? It was already empty, not even coal or fertilizer.
---
The new kobayashi maru is boring, because its flying away all the time, hard to heal in bigger waves. 
---
The old, first one was the interesting. 
---
We need this event in Fallout 76, it would be make some fun, im sure.
---
I'm level 395 but I play regularly.
---
well if the Enclave is honest about their motives we would welcome their help with open arms , I guess we shouldn't judge people  based on  whispered gossip and  instead judge them on their actions ( me and Shia have talked about covering the enclave at some part , there is definitely some intresting story connected to them )
---
I'm not sure where this would fall on your list but I'd put a bloodied plasma flamer somewhere around the middle. It uses rifleman perks but fires crazy fast and has a generous ammo capacity. Crafting ammo is a bitch but it certainly feels like it melts the queen.
---
INFINITE amounts of those items however. What you fail to realize it that every single digit, every unit is counted, and added to the memory load when each of these characters joins. The most common things duped were TSE Handmades, all exactly the same, making many of them stack with how the dupe worked, and 5.56 ammo. Still caused MASSIVE latency issues. This same issue is why many people that have played Skyrim, and Fallout 4 have long loading times the longer they play on a certain character, and hoard shit.
---
Attach wall conduits to the back outside metal walls, one on each side powers the whole thing.
---
To be clear on one thing: all the vendor bots pay (and charge) the same price for items. So it‚Äôs not like one vendor will give you a better price than another.  What affects prices is your Charisma level (the Hard Bargain perk card, and Grape Mentats help with this).
---
Yes, you need to become a Possum first. And for that you need to end the Tadpole questline
---
:O
---
The Enclave gives you permission to put them into an issue. Also the Enclave will consider making an alliance with the responders.

Grats!  I‚Äôm a filthy casual too lol all solo play and I stick to the left side of the map because I like easy mode, just got level 52 yesterday but I‚Äôve only been playing for two months.  
---
I will probably stop leveling this character and start a new one because the fun kind of died down when I noticed we can‚Äôt add more perk cards after level 50, me being a noob thought it was going to be unlimited perk cards the more you level lol I guess that would be pretty OP.  Oh well.  
---
But yeah still having tons of fun and helping out little lowbies when I can.
---
It's really not tho.
---
It's not that deep.
---
Since when? Have you looked and tried to build it?
---
Looks like it's 23$ on Xbox
---
First you need to attach something, like the power connectors to the trunk ;)

And the uprising begins...

Given how the last test where they flew in a bunch of different people to test the game didn't magically invert the reputation of the game regardless of the hopes of Bethesda or guarantee nearly enough development quality for NW I doubt Beth management would agree to offer the budget for another one and rather lets us test the content like usual at launch
---
Recommendation: As we recently lost Ren√© Auberjonois, some memorial mention would probably be appropriate and appreciated by the community.

Here you go, friends: [https://give.dearjackfoundation.org/team/270827](https://give.dearjackfoundation.org/team/270827)
---
Ah that thing
---
I actually didnt think it would be that simple.. hmm who knew
---
you are thinking of Two Shot Explosive (2 stars) TSE isn't as good as it used to be, but it can be okay to start.
---
No what you fail to understand is that every duped handmade has to loaded counted individually because each one has the potential to be different. 
---
A piece of steel scrap is the same as the next piece. It‚Äôs just a number next an entry. Not entirely new entry. 
---
1 round or 100,000 rounds of 5.56 makes no difference. Because there is no way for them to be different.
---
Nope, it's all just luck.  
---
I'm 270 and I've pulled a TSE once, and it was for a Combat Shotgun when I'm keen on the heavy weapons.  
---
You just keep trying and hope for the best.

Had

Jews?   Honestly the best answer because most care less about Xmas and a few really hate it.
---
False.
---
If your on PC I‚Äôll sell you a replacement sword for 500c
---
?
---
Oof, that does not sound good.
---
If you have stacks of them - they are bugged. 
---
Sell them all and start turning them in immediately after you get them to prevent it from glitching again.

The large holiday gift *might* have had a Legendary Instigating Hunting Rifle in it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs really sad that people downvote a post asking a question
---
Amazon was having some crazy good deals this week. I got Death Stranding for $30...I just got the text an hour ago that says its been delivered.
---
Getting them as drops or from Mrgph is all RNG, so probably not.  
---
I'm L159, and have only gotten 2 explosive weapons (not counting missle launcher).
---
expl. 44 revolver, expl vampire double barrel shotgun. 
---
Given I'm a melee build, neither were particularly useful - many other ballistic/non-legendary weapons in my inventory did more damage.
---
Yes I know, it only was a example that was coming up in to mind right away
---
This question is really answered best based on what you are looking to do with the build.   Are you a rifleman or a commando.
---
I use both builds, rifleman and commando. 
---
For my Rifleman build I prefer the Lever,  It just hits so much harder than the Handmade or the Assault Rifle for single shots.
---
For a commando build, the Handmade is the best option.   Alot of people are partial to the Fixer, but I found the Fixer is a better high capacity single shot rifle than it is an auto.   
---
In Summary, for a non auto rifleman build.  Lever - Fixer - Handmade - Assault Rifle.
---
For an autofire commando build.  Handmade - Fixer - Assault Rifle.
---
I have owned and use all 4.  I still own Fixers, Handmades and Levers.   Assault rifles unless they are god teir get sold for scrip.
---
The vertibots are the biggest joke in the game, with medium-high level good gun you can shoot them down in less than half a mag,
---
I agree, they provide no loot, little to no XP, and just take up an un-needed amount of space in the game, them flying around the map constantly, I'm sure the game would be better off without them.
---
Nope, I'm almost lvl 400 on my main and have gotten better stuff on my lvl 70 guy while lvling up than I have in the last 100 levels on my lvl400 main. It sucks.
---
I was gonna do a mix of both, but forgot that the semi auto/fully auto has a different perk set for each. I‚Äôll probably just stick to heavy guns for now since they all share 1 perk (except explosive ones)
---
That's exactly what I thought about it!!
---
Have you reset your router?
---
Already planning on it. :)
---
I actually dont see raiders blowing up their food source lol, but the settlers blowing up raiders now this I like.
---
I can only agree
---
The lack of an opposite spectrum unyielding set, the lack of serious e pone tidal boosting side perks, the carry weight (omfg the carry weight issues), etc etc. 
---
The games not designed well, so your feeling the pain of the second tier - honestly, do it if your bored of bloodied but it‚Äôs far far worse. 
---
That said, unless in sbq fights or pvp, you really don‚Äôt need the Uber damage, but the unyielding thing just helps cover up soooooo many shitty game mechanics, that your going to feel that one constantly.
---
I‚Äôm always amazed seeing somebody around level 500+, my jaw dropped when I seen a player level 1021 last night, first time I‚Äôve seen one that high, I guess they play a lot lol
---
Ty
---
Totally agree.  My TSE Lever is worthless in Vats.  The Instigating Lever moves between enemies  faster simply due to its hitting targets!
---
It‚Äôs a post apocalyptic Christmas tree lol
---
Shoot them down. Really doesn't take that much ammo :)
---
Get some XP, and if there's 3 of them, there should also be a strategic cargobot nearby.
---
It‚Äôs like $5 in any bargain bin, wtf are you going on a About?

Charlie Brown Xmas is played on tv every year
---
Ah, you are talking about the test, i meant the ingame event sry,  there was and old version and now there is one new callled "kobayasi maru event" its almost the same, its now a flying kobayashi maru ship instead of a not moving freighter.
---
Back to the topic:
---
I would love to see a response from bethesda to this idea, such an Event would improve the game a lot in terms of challenge as i already wrote, it should not be that hard to implement such an event i think.
---
Yes.  Moar pay to play please.
---
Hate Charlie Brown cartoons. Stupid and not funny
---
You need to own games on Steam to review them, and I doubt people who already dislike the game will bother to link their Steam accounts just to leave a negative review.  It'll also be reaching a new audience that way so there will be plenty of new players trying it for the first time. 
---
If Wastelanders ends up being a solid update and soft relaunch of the game, I can imagine it might make a comeback in the same vein as No Man's Sky.
---
I dont know how much they got nerfed past the explosives damage. But imo they are one of the buggiest weapons to use. 
---
I regularly get the health recharge with my shotgun build. Like almost every shot.
---
I have both as primed Furious.  The 50cal is my more-practical choice, due to ammo crafting efficiency as others have noted.  But if I notice a lot of other high-level players going to Fissure Prime (meaning I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll take her down), I‚Äôll bring my LMG since I think it is more fun to use (gotta love the sound).
---
Yeah, this is an issue that's been going on over a year, across different modems and service providers.. internet isn't the issue here.
---
Digital loads faster especially if you have an ssd drive installed.
---
What would be really cool is if you could use these without having to build a camp comprised of one wall and one foundation because, you know, gotta have them eat up that budget or the server will crash...
---
In other news today, a fool asks to trade his snickers wrapper for the Mona Lisa.
---
What do you mean? My camp is covered in taxidermy and I haven't had issues with crashing?
---
Happening to a lot of people. Myself included. Ps4. Happening to me for a few days now.
---
Only legit plan worth max caps.
---
Are you on xbox?  I might have an extra one.  I'll look tonight when I get home and let you know.  Gamertag is mrp0pp0d0p0l1s

Agreed.

[Here is a Bloodied pistol puild that wrecks face with pistol crits, and has room for a meathook, if you want.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c3443ff&amp;d=s52si2sj2c72ar2ao0a00a30lr0l71l12lt2lk2p02eh2s92ab2af2ai2ir2eu0lu2&amp;w=&amp;m=c4fe3g15028b&amp;nw=&amp;n=BloodOfMystery) If that doesn't suit you,  [pull points from Strength, and focus on pistols.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=39743ff&amp;d=c72ar2ao0a00a30lr0l71l12lt2lk2p02eh2ab2af2ai2ir2eu0lu2sg2pb2pe2eo2&amp;w=&amp;m=c4fe3g15028b&amp;nw=&amp;n=BloodOfMystery) Works fine with Gunslinger in place of Guerilla, too (I prefer the crits from auto weapons, but you can't count out the # of rounds a semi-auto 10mm can put downrange, and revolvers are arguably more fun.)
---
If he doesn't use vats it's not that great :/ If you have an idea of the AP consumption per hit it could give me another idea of this.
---
To me Medic effect suits better commando/guerilla user built with lot of LCK because you need to fill that crit meter as often as possible. I tested the effect on a revolver to have an idea how much it heals, to me it wasn't worth the crit.
---
I‚Äôve gotten a few mounted frogs. I think your best bet is to buy wrapping paper from vendors and make high quality gifts yourself and see what you get
---
Just go west from bog town, there‚Äôs a ton of them around the edge of the map. Walk along that fence maybe 30 feet away from it and keep going around the eye of the map
---
I use primed Z25 Gatling, it's quite beastly for a non-bloodied, non-junkie PA build. Would love to get my hands on F25 though.
---
Same I always check xp, scrip and fuzzy tokens before completion and I am noticing rewards are still given just no completion pop up
---
Gross. Its pretty irritating honestly. Im on ps4 as well and wonder if its just a ps4 issue or something. Glad to know I'm not the only one experiencing this.
---
I don't know what platform you're on but if you're on Xbox you might be able to find them on your recent list if you remember their name.
---
Those are options, though the hunting rifle is not even related.  Fixers are great, but the 10mm is much easier to control the recoil and has a larger mag.  Makes the 10 a fun gun.
---
yes this was a bug from a while back ..and they brought it back..you ar getting rewards it's just not showing
---
There are not bugs in Bethesda games. Only features. ;)
---
Level up a new character one for NW and one for Adventure mode. The rewards are shared across the whole account so no problem.
---
Well done. Very classy, sir.
---
I have a furious railway which hits her pretty hard
---
I was stuck in the nukeshine loading loop several times without riding Mr Fuzzy, actually. I don't think this is a bug related to Mr Fuzzy.
---
No PS4. Thanks anyways
---
Its pretty annoying to not be able to see what your rewards. Its like your boss secretly giving you your paycheck in your pocket on payday when you're not looking and you dont find it till you get home.
---
I mean... it‚Äôs basically a Charlie Brown Christmas tree... pretty cool if you ask me. Input on the bed of the truck at my camp.
---
huh, I got Fallout 1st and now I don't need mules anymore, I have 4 actual characters that I play
---
It‚Äôs on TV every year lol. It‚Äôs a Christmas classic.
---
Isn't there a clean toy truck in the toy store at the whitesprings? Or try in the houses outside at the whitesprings - one of them is a shop with a christmas tree in it and I believe there's clean toys on a shelf there too? Could be wrong but worth a shot.
---
Thanks ill take a look now
---
I think a lot of people who prefer this iconic Charlie Brown tree
---
Hahahah it‚Äôs a dull feeling indeed
---
Any ideas about why I no longer get rewards for doing the dailies ? The dross toss and chow line both give me nothing now.
---
They're range is a tiny bit further than melee range. If you put out a lot of DPS, the enemies regen their health. Shotguns aren't worth using at all atm.
---
For atoms yes
---
Sweet, my fourth character just hit 98 last night
---
I think there might be fuel behind Sweetewaters house, the one with the honey quest
---
True lol, same here but maybe start with 2 advertis on here for 2 peaple then invite them to a private server, I dont even no if you can have 2 groups on one private server. Am sure someone reading this will no and are already doing this if it can be done
---
That is really good to know.
---
I have fallout first also but that only covers junk not weapons and armor and aid. But I guess I have more of said items than you. After I consolidated all my junk all that did was free up a little weight on all characters.  Still need the mules.
---
You can't add anymore special points after 50 but you can still pick more perkcards.  Almost guaranteed that at 50 a bunch of the perk cards you have right now are garbage and could be swapped out for better ones making your character much stronger than they are now.  You can start a new character too, doesn't matter to me in the least lol. Just pointing there is still progress to be made after level 50.
---
Well that is going to sound terrible with VOIP latency, but good on them for trying.
---
Always take a picture and send to player.  Lets them know it works every time.
---
I‚Äôm SaLtY bEcAuCe He‚ÄôS nOt BeInG cOmMuNiTy!
---
They are supposed to, but sometimes (¬π/10) they don't. When you"mine" them again you get no ore, but another spawn of scorched.
---
Find a new game
---
Yeah man that tree is the shit.    Its charlie brown. I have one in real life it is spectacular
---
Definitely has a afk timer, I sit on a workbench and get 45min, I think.
---
You just have to quickly manually fast travel somewhere before it fades out again to break the loop.
---
Ive found most people to be decent about to thankfully
---
Oh by the Big Teapot?
---
True, but so useful to navigate the map,and get to sniper spots.
---
Doens't work on SBQ as far as I can tell. Tried this several times.
---
Buy an XBOX
---
I think a good idea around this for npc‚Äôs outside the no-nuke zone of the forest is to have them run into a bunker or underground for cover at their set location. 
---
After the nuke drops at their location, they‚Äôll emerge in a hazmat suit and go about like business as usual - perhaps scowling at players for our brazen use of nuclear arms!
---
Melee is the best build for the SBQ.
---
No Debate
---
Best chances are for large presents for those rare mounts. I got almost all of those from large handmade presents.
---
The worst I've gotten yet was a single bottle of wine. WTF? I would have been so angry if I'd actually spent hundreds of caps to craft a small gift and got one bottle of wine.
---
Good to know, looks like I'm going to have to create a new character
---
It happens to any game.  Altho games are easy to play, they aren't easy to write :)
---
A great writeup of how elusive these can be to find sometimes:
---
https://twitter.com/_taylorswope/status/1205252714680045568
---
One of the containers in Blackwater Mine has a few of the mr handy fuel cannisters as well as some others outside the mine.
---
It's just a visual bug came back with the latest update you still get your rewards
---
Oh, you are right, I never noticed that.
---
I thought the health regen bug was happening for all weapon types. Is that not the case or is there something extra wonky about shotguns on top of that?
---
I had Nukashine trip that showed the loading screen saying "Half the fun of Nukashine is that you never know what kinds of crazy places it will take you", then it to a blue screen with an error code.
---
No just set up one per workshop, then come back and harvest periodically.
---
https://map76.com/junk_misc/newtoytruck
---
Don't see the handy fuel on there
---
Sitting and fast traveling are bad combinations.
---
If you think this stuff is easy, check out a writeup from Obsidian on chasing down a bug with climbing ladders:
---
lol
---
It's only shotguns atm. It used to happen with any high rate of fire weapon but that was fixed long ago.
---
Well, "ride" as in a kiddy horse shaped like Mr. Fuzzy that rocks and plays music.
---
I have an extra Voice of Set and the sword. If you want it, ill trade for it
---
Did you ever find it?
---
I've got a weightless anti ghoul flamer on one of my alts, (can't remember what the third star is atm) I don't use vats on it, I figure it's a flamethrower. I pretty much spray and pray on any mobs that come at me. Something about burning the shit out of large groups of things is very satisfying.
---
Are you 12?
---
I didn't either for the longest time. Frees up 3 perk slots for another luck perk though.
---
Honestly, I used to run a bloody heavy build, and switched to commando because anti armor didn't work for the energy weapons, but now that it's fixed, i might switch back tbh. On paper me BE Plasma gatling should easily out perform my handmade.
---
Yea, just like why would haters come to this subreddit to trash the game, oh wait that happened.
---
I got over 100 at level 395.
---
Oh that thing. I thought it was just some lawn decore. Did not know it had a real function.
---
Oh, also Demo expert isn't worth the amount of points it takes up. Maxed out it's only an extra 20 points of damage or so, but takes 5 slots. Just fyi.
---
New toy truck in Wavy Willard's Water Park in one of the stands, you're welcome :-)
---
Lol so very true
---
Thanks, appreciate it.  That‚Äôs true, last night I was looking up useful builds and switching perk cards for more useful ones and spent all the scrip I had saved on weapons and armor.  I will probably keep going later but leveling a new character from scratch just feels more fun at the moment lol
---
Ikr ;) smileInBBQ
---
That's a fact. Here's a datamined chart of drop chances from all gift types: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0
---
How did you get so many kills for rad ants.
---
I guess you're right. I think it'll be like that again.  
---
But they did mention something like test servers as a future possability right?
---
Oh, I‚Äôll just eat them then lol
---
This. Its range is just a hair longer than a melee weapon, beyond that you need twenty shots to kill a mole rat if you‚Äôre lucky, closer than that it‚Äôs instant death to the user. And you need to farm plastic to use the ammo. It‚Äôs entirely not worth the struggle if it‚Äôs your only build. I‚Äôve been using a few double barrel shotguns lately because I wanted the ‚Äòhurt me plenty‚Äô in Doom. And yes i do die a lot more than my rifle/heavy builds. The sound of shotguns is very satisfying though.
---
I've heard the karaoke, how much will it cost to for no singing.
---
My two characters got one each quite at the beginning of the event.
---
[Nope](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0)
---
Yep it was there
---
Im not sure. On another site they were saying there are 2 that are called the same but one gives out more oil. Maybe thats it. Idk but people have said they have gotten it
---
Thanks for the info! I‚Äôve handmade a few gifts, in which I did get 1 Santa crash plan. I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm going to have to make more gifts to try my luck.
---
I‚Äôm salty because I‚Äôm shaming a raider...okie dokie. Also, you need to understand sarcasm a little better...it is the internet, derpin.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and get this sometimes, sometimes it‚Äôll show the rewards but not xp, sometimes it shows nothing at all and I wonder if I got anything at all.  Hope they fix this bug.
---
Now that I have fallout first all that I can make. Currently I have over 100 of each stable fluxes.  But again  they are weightless in the scrap box.
---
Not really he just says they have two heads the could easily just have two glowing noses or just one head has one glowing nose that would still make it more special than all the other radstags.
---
I always just have 10 of violet (I use this the most) and 5 of the rest....when I need more, I go do a nuke run.
---
Awesome.
---
Pipe revolver is even betterer, yes it‚Äôs a rifle AND a pistol once you put on a rifle stock. I carry all of them (handmade, lever, fixer) on my rifleman toon but haven‚Äôt used anything other than IE/BE pipe revolvers.
---
although the ncr added the coat to the LAPD riot armor to make their ranger outfits, the advanced and elite versions of the coat are more akin the the ones worn by the 11th armored cavalry regiment pre war. to me that seems that would indicate that the coats are in fact part of the outfit. though it would be cool to see a coat less version, i doubt we will see it due to the fact that we have 2 versions (one still on the way) and 3 skins for it already. i suspect some people will be pissed if that get a forth ranger armor rather than something else instead
---
Wow... The attention to detail, craftsmanship, and all around affinity for the love of Fallout 76 can certainly be felt with this... Art. It's simply beautiful, I absolutely adore it. Thank you for sharing this, I'm certainly gonna be a follower üòé
---
That was a rumor from a while ago. Did my own testing but it never took.
---
Yeah, they need to address the ghost hitting with melee. If I'm seeing damage numbers, I should be doing said damage.
---
Glassed cavern is by far the best spot imo.  Mining the ultracite nodes spawns scorched so long as you've cleared them already.  You can literally go to the bottom, kill everything along the way, then work your way back up mining ultracite and get an entirely new set of scorched.  
---
10+ presents per trip is pretty normal.
---
I was just wondering if it could be done it was a curiosity type request post.
---
I check those exclusively when I look for the Megasloth and I still never find any.
---
im guessing some dwellers are so &gt;!shitfaced!&lt; drunk that they slept for a whole year. we do have nukashine that causes people to black out and teleport far away
---
I only keep a few on hand to make serums to sell randomly but I never have a steady supply and I only go do the queen if someone else is running it.
---
Is the game playable or still bad? Are the micro transactions also as bad as I‚Äôve heard?
---
i would like to at least see some concept art of what that would look like at some point :)
---
Make their damn wings damageable so you can bring them down for good.
---
How much damage do you do?
---
Hell is the impossibility of reason.
---
This, plz.
---
I honestly think you're just nitpicking.  If you want a game that doesn't allow anyone in after the launchday, that's on you.  But nothing you wrote is a legitimate criticism as far as I am concerned.  There are certain meta elements that are required for online games.  Else you might as well poke holes in how COD has over ten thousand times the numbers of actual qualified specops personnel fielded in Army TO&amp;E.
---
im a friendly raider and i will not try to steal your items at all 
---
add me: Owl_No
---
Before I got the Scrapbox, I basically kept 20 of each and sold the rest.  It weighs a lot and as you figured yourself, you've easily got 100 WT of stash wrapped up in something rare-but-often-useless.
---
I didn't really have a use for it, other than crafting Shielded underarmor and serums to sell.  Players who rely on crafting Fusion Cores, among other things, would have different needs.
---
I have about 20 of each for serums, repairs, etc. but I keep about 100 yellow cake to make prime plasma cores
---
Its worth it for $20 I say, current state of game feels pretty sad though, lately its been between trash and semi-trash.
---
It's kind of a semantic problem.  We're told that Vault 76 shuts down and becomes inhospitable after we leave.  A better explanation may have been that it becomes inaccessible *to us*.  Because the current conceit makes it sound like everyone had to be out the moment we left.
---
The fallout community in game is not as bad as the sub is. Honestly, I've met some cool people in game and gotten alot of help. Don't be afraid of other players, but be cautious and stay safe Dweller
---
It‚Äôs weird I‚Äôve never had a problem with melee hit detection in adventure mode, only in Nuclear Winter.
---
I use to make and sell shielded underarmors. They sell for a few hundred. Some folks just don't want to go through the trouble of earning the plans for them, and I can't I blame them really. I mean, I kinda enjoyed turning in technical data and such, over and over again, but it's not everybody's thing.
---
Im reallg glad you posted a tutorial. Ive never had a fireplace that I used til recently.
---
Tempted to make a player home copy of my actual house, instead of using the bungalow to approximate van life lol.
---
The atom shop items have been hyping me up. The rustic sink and this.
---
I like crammed or well cluttered builds instead of sparse mansions so each item like this that shrinks the amount of fudging you have to do to approximate a functional unit like thia helps (ive seen square brick places before with the red fireplace but it takes several pieces instead of this just taking one.
---
Only other items id like to buy would be a small shower unit and a player version of the tabletop propane grill they have in game for a cooking station
---
Ah i gotcha. Well that sucks, i love the Combat Shotgun.
---
Thanks for the info. Much appreciated!
---
All that Rad Ant lager
---
The way I see it is that $20 bucks won't stop me from doing anything i need like getting groceries or paying for bills so I'm thinking I'm gonna snag it. Sounds like a lot of the major problems is with the hacking in NW/PVP which I don't plan on playing. And the community sounds like they are very helpful in game and that's always a plus in my book.
---
At least it's a monster in Nuclear Winter :D
---
I‚Äôve never played melee, i just assumed that was the reason for this thing existing lol
---
I think the fact that the Enclave has the only working bars left says a lot
---
Not sure where you find that. Just saw for $60 at both target and Best Buy.
---
I agree! Logically a beast like the scorchbeast and especially the queen couldn't maintain flight for long due to how heavy they are(check how much their body parts weight). Would take a lot of energy to maintain flight thus should make them stay on the ground most of the time.
---
No
---
Is it worth making the small gifts or just do large??
---
Oh modding community, where would we be without you.
---
Ehm... so... well...
---
I'll just leave this here:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-V\_21wvVqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-V_21wvVqg)
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs been my issue as well
---
it is just you, the box on the back is lockable and so is the attaching terminal (two locks) locking one does not block the other
---
You can't lock it while the bot is in the glass tube.
---
Rather than mess around with a door,  I walled off an entire block and remove/replace the wall whenever I want to empty it.
---
No one said they're leaving Vault 76...
---
Outside of this Christmas event gift wrapping, plans are like the only thing I spend caps on. Having a new currency to spend on plans would immensely devalue caps in my opinion.
---
You need to mark exactly the box of the santatron in the building menu then you got the option to lock it.
---
Loot from the queen or, loot from the event? I think one needs to hit for at least 250 damage ( read that somewhere...I think there was a post about it here) before you can loot the queen. Sometimes, the event itself won't immediately drop a reward ( it pops later ) and sometimes, zilch.
---
I really want a decontamination shower that looks like the biometric scanner in the silo for my camp
---
The OP is acting as if there's only one Vault. The original road map with Wastelanders has the answer.
---
Not the npcs...players still leaving 76
---
Start a fresh character if you want that fresh experience
---
On some rare occasions she drops nothing for some people but most of the time it is because you didn't do enough damage to her.
---
Nature of the beast.  
---
Be it here, Diablo, or D&amp;D: you roll on loot tables and hope for the best.
---
In other news, the orbital strike works with last laugh....
---
Shotguns weren't nerfed iirc.  Explosive was heavily nerfed.  
---
So explosive shotguns got the worst of the nerf, as before you would get 100% additional damage per pellet, and most shotguns output 6 or 7 pellets per shot.  So an explosive shotgun was like 6 or 700% more damage than a non explosive.  
---
After the nerf explosive shotguns deal vastly less damage than before it.  
---
But non explosive shotguns are essentially unchanged since launch.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who gets attached to items.  I'd love to be able to level up my weapons
---
Yeah. I'm finally planning to start another for fun/muling tonight. My main is 150 though and I still find new ways to change up my build and make him more badass.  I thought I was good at 50 too but it wasn't until about level 75-80 though that I actually ended up with something viable enough to dish out really good damage end game.  Had I done actual planning it wouldn't have taken quite as long...
---
Plus at 50 you've just unlocked the possibility to use all of the best gear available to you. Finding all the right stuff for your build makes a huge difference gameplay wise.
---
Anytime I play nuclear winter i always play pacifist who hides to make it to top 10 for the rewards. But ive never been in a team while doing that. :/ It seems unfair to other people if all im doing is hiding in a bush and sneaking around.
---
People break into mine and steal them regardless so the lock isn‚Äôt working to well for me üòÇ
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one myself. J just think that it would add another layer to the game.
---
That was pretty much me before the scrap box.
---
Yeah FWIW - it feels ramped up to some degree. I won't say it's 2x normal but it feels at least 1.5x normal.  
---
Of course I have no hard numbers on this (and should record some) but it sure feels like a multiplier somewhere got slightly increased. 
---
Whether accidental or intentional - BGS should probably get ahead of this and make a clear statement so that the more cynical &amp; vocal of the player-base don't start going off on a Repair-Kit-in-the-shop tangent. 
---
*Which i can't 100% blame them for given that they (players) have some fairly-relevant ammo once again with repair rates being ü§î and 10$ repair kit bundles available.*
---
It seems like an easy PR problem to get ahead of if you are in the right. Just be transparent - comment that players could be experiencing just bad luck - and head it off early. 
---
Of course - if it isn't bad luck - don't try to beat around the bush - just admit you made a mistake and promise to fix it and then fix it. 
---
EG: Like the Santatron drop rates or the gaudy AS Standee.
---
Some of those plans are a grind to be fair.  I sell Operative, BOS and Raider UA at 1200c pretty regularly, still need that dang Casual SHielded plan at lvl 270.
---
Is this on a console? My computer is smooth, fast, and has very few problems
---
That code in a game box is so derpy, just freaking email it to me already.
---
Sure, so do I, but you're not getting much AP regen returns after 3 pieces really. The 25% less vats cost effect helps mitigate your AP use and you can get automatic rifles down to where they cost Zero AP anyway. I did this with a Combat rifle and Handmade. Still need to learn dot sights for radium rifle but it's pretty low AP use atm :)
---
I have had alot of issues it. It does not keep me from using my build but there's alot of time where I'll land a direct hit, Enemy flinches or falls and no damage.  The worst is when they straight up fall down refill HP and keep at it.
---
Not really lol we are basically a group that goes off and does our own thing. We have a discord group that we are setting up that way customers can request for certain services from certain caravan traders. 
---
Traders could even post that they are going to be online with shops open. 
---
Traders are put into certain areas of trade designed for them to be the most efficient.
---
Wait Santa tron finds gifts?
---
New toy truck is easily found in the Christmas house in white spring
---
Yeah i got it thanks
---
I forgot what that one even does I remember it vaguely though
---
If you or a friend have FO 1st, one solution is to farm gifts on a private server by taking workshops and setting up a protected Santatron at each. Then hop around and farm for a while before going back to Adventure. No need to worry about anyone stealing üëç
---
PS4 is $10 on amazon right now
---
Make sure all your three bullets hit the queen.
---
It makes a huge spark when you punch someone and sends them flying from goodsprings to New Vegas. It's like a force glove thingy
---
At this point - I'm pretty sure Wastelanders is a massive commitment &amp; the source of the dev / art teams time and effort for this year. Because of that it seems it has by and large cannibalized the efforts towards the 'downstream' version we play.
---
BGS has - from what I've seen - told us as much . Explicitly with the back-porting of fixes last week that didn't work. 
---
Because they are likely so focused on "Fallout 76 2020-2.0" -  I imagine someone high up made the call that they had to put in less effort for 2019 and knuckle down on 2020.  So they had to stretch about two weeks of Christmas content over the full 4.
---
This is why I think we've seen everything out of order and stretched thin over the whole month. Probably could have been better thought out in terms of release timing but at the same time I've been in production crunches so I get it.
---
Locking it doesnt work, unless you like to hunt present theives
---
I had one guy last night who took turns bouncing between my buddy's camp and mine. 
---
We both just sat around waiting for him to come back. 
---
He went wanted and was subsequently killed 5-6 times.
---
Kept coming back for more.
---
We kept making free caps from him.
---
Ouch the budget is screaming with this üò´ but ye it works well even do a lil myself haha
---
Its just strange because my bloodied combat shotgun does fine, its just not explosive.
---
That's when its a test... can I beat them down before their bar refills fully :P It's the only struggle enemies will give me with a bloodied build lol.
---
That HAS to be xp exploits
---
I got both masks along with the 3 jumpsuits for the Savage Divide region from the Uranium Fever event
---
Google docs, imgur etc.
---
Do you mean Enclave Commendations?
---
Oh this is great. I haven't played in a while bit it sounds fun. I have no money to donate.
---
PS4 recently did an update and I haven't had anymore error codes.
---
The Enclave agrees with you
---
Are you still interested? I did not go online yesterday after work due to the heat. It was 44 degrees Celsius or 111 Fahrenheit when I left work at 7pm. Way too hot!
---
I am not sure how to organise this as I have never done this before?
---
Gotta feed the pig.
---
Oops sorry for my horrible grammatical error
---
Make checks out.
---
Depends on your play style.
---
I like to be sneaky and a gung-ho blaster, so I run a stealth Commando build. (no VATS) 
---
There are build guides on the internet that can guide you through the maze of perk cards and mutations. Check out a few and tweek them to the what suits you best. 
---
My style was same as it was in FO4, I just have to dick about with swapping quality of life perks and combat perks in FO76, however there will apparently be an update with perk load-out presets in the future (PC have a mod for this)
---
Good luck
---
This has literally been a problem since launch. They aren't going to fix it.
---
Doors can be picked as well, so it doesn't really matter, we going to get your gifts one way or another ..  happy holidays.
---
Theres also a large percentage of Fallout players that want multiplayer activities. Cause we have friends that also love Fallout and want to do it together. But your wish is somehow more important? Kay. 
---
You got 3 and NV and 4 for your single player. And actually about 80% of this game cause they predicted this level of butt hurt and wanted to help out the butt hurts to not feel left out. 
---
Also you have no claim to it being "a single player franchise".  That's what GTA was until GTAO.  Nobody is bitching about that. And no, it doesn't work better than FO. Dont even try.
---
Private servers FTW.  üí™
---
Got 400 gifts of varying sizes in the last 2 days by just jumping between workshops in the valley, forest and heap. Got most of the rare plans, most importantly the plasma grenade so I can finally finish that effing badge.
---
5-10 Caps for a present is worth it :)
---
yeah they did mention them but I highly doubt them releasing test servers any time soon before Wastelanders (otherwise they would've teased them in any recent ITV or elsewhere or would've atleast mentioned them again,wouldn't they?)
---
Lets face it, the last testing group wasn't invited to truly 'test' stuff or on behalf of the devs there but because Bethesda thought they could sell it well and invert the reputation of the game so my assumption is they're likely going to sell us those test servers as 'new features/content' after a (maybe catastrophic? pls no...) Wastelanders release.
---
I just want a reflex sight for the 10mm SMG and the pump shotgun :/
---
I keep about 5 of each in reserve
---
I do craft serums for the daily caps and for sale.  Also for ultracite ammo (especially 308s for LMG).
---
If you have any extra - I will be happy to buy/trade
---
Grape mentats i think.
---
Calm down bruh.
---
My first post said to allow the boss to scale to the number of players.
---
Why do you multi players always insist on having your own events with rewards unobtainable to single players?
---
You already fucked us out of TSE weapons with your complaining about balance......just let us have solo boss fights so we can get the OP gear to......wtf is so complicated about that?
---
I feel like this is the kind of idea that would be added as part of the atomic shop
---
we look forward to wastelanders too but we might not immediately cover it so as to avoid spoiling others enjoyment of it . give it a month or three then start writing and drawing our adventures:)
---
Well there's a mutation that boosts unarmed. That makes up for the lack of damage perks.
---
Go to https://nukacrypt.com/map and search for these two IDs: 
---
0006A37A
---
000938C2
---
One of these might be the one you've looking for
---
Grape Mentats. +5 Charisma. 
---
You can also use Food to increase Charisma (Mothman Egg Omelets give +2, Sweet Rolls give +3, but have more components to gather)
---
Beer can also give a +1, or even a +3 with Party Boy/Girl. 
---
There are other methods, but these are the easiest.
---
i joined the enclave on my last playthrough and it was the only good desicision i made
---
Unyielding armor and low life is the biggest ongoing specials boost. Keep 2or 3 peices and just go in low life, I do this on big purchases (serum recipes). Grape mentants are easy to craft, and they get you enough boost usually.
---
I dont bother anymore with that challenge, way too time consuming for a measly few atoms
---
Have you played as another character to see if you have the same problem with them?
---
I think they are only mod boxes.
---
do the vendors sell them ever if I were to server hop Harper's ferry/watoga
---
Ah, I see. Is there anything that makes you think it's been 1 year since Vault 76 has opened? I know a lot of people speculated that when the Wastelanders trailer came out, but the Overseer's voice says "it's been *some time*" and not "it's been *one year*."
---
The only confirmed future event we know about is that on June 2, 2108 (5 years, 7 months, and 10 days after Vault 76 opened), the Vault 51 Overseer escaped from Vault 51 and soon after ran into another survivor just before he died near Vault 76. That Overseer is somehow in Appalachia in 2102, even though we know that he was still in Vault 51 on the current Groundhog/Reclamation Day. That discrepancy has not yet been reconciled.
---
Though Vault 76 was supposed to shut down within 24 hours or Reclamation Day, that doesn't mean that everyone would die in there within 24 hours. This Vault housed America's best and brightest - there were also reports of thefts and hacking within the Vault. It is conceivable that one or more committed Vault residents could have been afraid to leave Vault 76 due to the rumors that were spreading within the Vault of horrific conditions outside of the Vault. Since no one was forcing them to leave the Vault, they could have easily stayed behind and continued living in the vault. It was self-sustaining. The only thing that would have prevented them from staying there is a programmed shutdown.
---
I think that Rudolph should have only one head and a glowing red nose, and that he should in a herd with DasherDancer,  PrancerVixen, and all the other two headed Reindeer. And this is going to either have to be a help-the-reindeer quest, or you're going to have to come up with a ***really*** good reason to get me to kill Rudolph.
---
Maybe someone got one to glow red, and we're to help remove the extra head?
---
THIS. I started a new toon and leveled it to 50 before doing any quests so the reward weapons (especially the precious Perfect Storm) would be maxed.  I would love to be able to upgrade just these special legendaries to keep them,  just the level, not even the stars. I have Somerset Special and Perfect Storm with me again, and starting over (or I'd be level 203)  was worth it to have them useful all the way.
---
I see
---
Ahh cool. I did see there was an system update last night but I haven‚Äôt been on 76 to test. I was going to say I‚Äôve done some research and that blue screen is an issue with our PlayStation and or internet. I get that blue screen almost every time I play for a extended period of time daily. I can tell right before it happens. Seems my fan gets going really fast and louder. It has screwed me over many times during important battles or events. Mainly nuked area and SB fights
---
Wish I could upvote this more than once.
---
Pick your favorite weapon, build around that, go heavy on damage perks and damage reduction, try to stay away from wieght carry perks and other QOL.  Bloodied is easier than you may think, with the right build. Junkies is a very good full life build. Sneaking in general is really powerful, and melee is so easy to buff, you can save alot of perk space.
---
Doesn't really make sense because by not having legendary power armor you are making a meta of having legendary armor pieces so that makes no sense why a legendary armor meta is okay but legendary power armor meta isn't.
---
Formula p gives maybe 3-5 charisma but grape mentats are the go to.
---
It adds up towards it. 
---
The best way to get XP if you're bad at pvp is to hide in a bush and such and survive as long as possible, you get a lot if you're one of the last survivors. 
---
Finally: Quitting affects nothing.
---
Used to happen to me all the time but it has switched itself to the ammo bug now.
---
Shotguns proc on each pellet, makes a really powerful heal .
---
What exactly do you mean by messed up? Character creation is really fluent here, pretty much the only way to permanently ruin something is getting rid of a unique quest reward or to severely bug up a quest line. If you don't like your build, you can eventually respec back where you want it to be, once you start reaching the lvl 150+ region you're going to have absolutely nothing to do with your level ups
---
Looks like I‚Äôm missing something. I thought that santatron is some dude walking around and talking. Appears it can be harvested? But how?
---
keypad doors work equally as well, they could sit there for ages and not get your entry code
---
I've once encountered the nukashine loading loop on PC a couple of weeks ago too. It would stay in the new location for a couple of seconds before loading again at a new location.
---
Because bathesda never said you would be able to make one your self. And never did they say they would be free.
---
In Nuclear Winter, that's a problem with ALL weapons. It's hard to notice, but if you record and review as many gameplay videos as I do, you'll see this happening all the time.
---
google "how does business work."
---
What do you have against Charlie Brown? Ha ha Ha. The tree is from a very famous Christmas special here in the USA. Do you hate Christmas?
---
My best gun for my sniper build is an instigating/33 pct hit lever action. It kills 90 pct of the enemies in one sneak shot. My best crowd control is my quad faster fire rate lever. 20 rounds makes it an absolute beast.
---
Can't speak to commando rifles but fixers and handmades are highly sought after. 
---
Regardless of what you pick I recommend fully speccing into the particular build, otherwise you are handicapping yourself.  Once you get enough levels you can pick all the rifleman perks and commando perks and swap the cards back and forth.
---
I mean yeah I would say so, unless there was some crazy xp farm but I don‚Äôt think someone would be that committed, I‚Äôll get the screenshot in a sec
---
Agreed.  I never felt like I was joining anyone.  Just using the tools they left behind.  Hard to be alligned when there isn't anyone here to allign with.
---
How? Gifts cant drop legendaries.
---
How do you lock them?
---
So technically shotguns with explosive had infinite range, right?
---
stable flux sells almost as fast as i can put in my vendor.
---
Seems like I've been getting more large gifts the last couple days got 4 last nite from Santatron a bunch of smallsl and not many mediums
---
Don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs what I got when I opened it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Me neither :(
---
Same way you lock water purifiers. I think it‚Äôs a left stick click?
---
if you actually have to ask that question then it‚Äôs highly unlikely you could maintain a private server.
---
Its too damn big. Gotta have a huge mansion to use it. I didnt know it was going to be the size of a redwood when I bought it. It also consumes more budget than I want but CAMP budget is another issue.
---
Was waiting for this. Replaced my physical version, so now my buddy and I can play together when he is over. (Have a PS4 and a PS4 Pro)
---
2nd this. The only downside is ammo consumption and weapon breakage.
---
95% of the time if there‚Äôs a scorchbeasts I‚Äôll just server hop. I have no time for that bs as a melee character. And I‚Äôm not killing a legendary one for a 1 Star. They should never be less than 2 star and should always drop items of the equivalent stars
---
bah humbug! :P
---
On medic ? I know for vampire but medic doesn't work as 1 crit use = 1 team heal?
---
Aqua boy/girl, especially in Morgantown map. Chill deep in some water, just keep an eye on the circle. You can use photomode(no depth of field) as a periscope.
---
Rad resistant perk- hide in the storm for longer marathoner- run further, gun runner- run faster w/pistol,   medical perk- heals more with each (rare) stim, armor DR perk- more DR, explosive for damage, throw grenades and run, leave mines as booby traps.
---
Dress for success, dark clothes and some type of dark mask, no glowing skeleton outfits! Other players have to see you to shoot at you.
---
If you luck into alot of radaway, farm some mutations. Chameleon is the holy Grail, remember to strip off your armor if you are ever so lucky.
---
I agree that does help but if the santatron loads before the walls when they ft to your base they can still steal it.
---
Is that game still dogshit or did they patch it to worth playing?
---
Unless you're called xxdark18294xx...then I think I got a lead.
---
I feel like some of these responses seem slightly aggressive lol. I‚Äôm excited for wastelanders bc honestly the game has needed this since launch, but I was also wondering how it fits in story-wise, not that I really care. The whole storyline seems so unthought through. Following the overseer is anticlimactic. Still play it though lol
---
I agree but I kind of did the opposite I got a bunch of shit when I was a lower lvl that was 45 and 40. I sold it thinking ahhhhhh I'll get it again and haven't ever seen those weapons since lol. Although I got a lower lvl zealots gatling gun with lik extra 30% scorched dmg still. If those weapons had been low enough for me to use I would've kept them but $%^&amp; it.
---
you only need to do that to see the animation. the spotlights are still functioning in the background.
---
well this was written by a forbes journalist, so you‚Äôre right
---
Tbh if you care for a good team just bring 3 friends. Stop complaining that a random group isnt helpful.
---
HOW?
---
Sorry for your loss, man.  That sucks.
---
Probably the display bug where legendaries don‚Äôt show up on the screen until another thing prompts it ( if a legendary doesn‚Äôt show up when you kill an animal, completing a quest may cause both to show up on screen)
---
Yep. Forced matchmaking would mean you might have to carry players who are AFK. I like wandering alone too.
---
How do I sign up?
---
Never mind, I wont be available then anyway.
---
That could be. It popped up after I opened the package, but I had also just earned atoms for some useless task I don‚Äôt remember. 
---
So, thanks. And now I feel much less guilty!
---
Lol. Starting my own squishy right now so I can clear stash space.  Like your idea!  It is painful not having my mutations though. Trying to slowly limp to a train station.
---
Sorry, I was going over all of these videos, and there are too many variables to really tell if there's something going on with the damage you're seeing. For example, in one video you had the Grognak's Axe, Power Armor, and Psycho. In other video, you had standard armor and a pole hook without any drugs. It's unclear how much time had passed between those videos, what your builds were at each point, etc.
---
In NW, Power Armor will sometimes give you +7 Strength. It doesn't always display it, but it's there. That will affect your melee damage. We'd need apples-to-apples comparisons of weapons damage to tell if something is wrong
---
I‚Äôm sorry for the rant I just see posts like this to often.
---
Or worse you get put on a team with some annoying hyper active person or some asshole screaming racist rants the whole time.
---
Just let us play solo if we want without locking us out of gear.
---
They aren't always in vendors.  Some of the places I listed, they will be the little wooden mod boxes, casually placed on some crate or shelf next to a power armor station.  
---
But yes, sometimes you can find them in vendors too.  I think it's best to check all over.
---
‚ÄúThE eClAve hAs tHe SaMe PrObLem‚Äù
---
Where there's a will, there's a way.  But at least it will deter some people.
---
It's a future Atomic Shop skin.
---
That's definitely what I saw them wielding.
---
Not true.
---
Notifications are bugged after the last patch. You're the 58th person to comment on this.
---
Why should the private servers be free? Most games that have private servers cost money.
---
I was always under the impression you could do this already, until I ran into this same issue and googled it. Very sad.
---
I‚Äôm just hear to say that doubleshot explo is way better than TSE know that I‚Äôve heard it.
---
Hell yeah
---
FO4 qas a stand-alone game with stand-alone DLC. FO76 is an online multiplayer game. Hosting servers is completely different from one another.
---
I cant believe I gotta fap again during the same poop session.
---
Yes! I love my Somerset Special .44, but it‚Äôs only a level 5 weapon. I really want to be able to upgrade it for continued usefulness and to burn through the AMMO I have stockpiled for it.
---
because it's more profitable for Bethesda this way and they don't really care about customers.
---
....so....suggesting a mounted dog head probably not a good idea.
---
Why does electricity cost money and why can't I build a nuclear powerplant in my backyard?
---
Nope, game randomly generates keypad codes upon construction.
---
Oh I'm kinda surprised the bumper sword didn't stay a thing with super mutants and all.
---
Makes me want a manhole cover as a shield either use it to tank or to captain America melee the enemies
---
Launch him inro orbit with spring trap
---
[Here it is ](https://imgur.com/a/N9r3AJ2) kinda insane actually
---
There are definitely way's past those walls and thieves love getting around your defenses.  A few super mutants helped me past someones wall just last night.   Best way to protect your gifts is to just turn your vending off.
---
Same. My shotgun turret never stops. I always have to store/scrap it and build it again, for it to be passive again.
---
With new characters I literally avoid doing quests that I know come with leveled rewards until I'm above 50.  It's kind of a shitty way to play.
---
Sometimes if you lay down a landmine, it will trigger and kill the spawn.  It's a coin toss.
---
Fast traveling out and back again seems to be the more reliable method of fixing the glitch.
---
They can still get in if your CAMP loads in such a way that the walls don't spawn before they get there, but there's nothing one can really do about that.
---
That‚Äôs what I did to get them to stop.
---
ERROR! DOES NOT COMPUTE!
---
I also did this to fix it you just have to go onto another Mr fuzzy ride then get off it and the music will stop
---
My load screen didnt get stuck but the music kept playing. Me and my friend were running around with the fuzzy theme song for a while lol
---
why not? its just a bunch of zeroes and ones
---
Those were well designed in that they can be leveled up.
---
Can confirm.  I'm grinding my way through the rewards, currently lvl 73 in Nuclear winter and i've probably killed less than 30 players the whole time.   I even get Overseer about 1-in-10.  Sometimes without even getting a single kill.
---
Had a good few hours tonight on a private world and Santatron was showering me with gifts from my base and 5 workshops.
---
Good bot.
---
Seeing it for sake at a higher price doesn‚Äôt mean a damn thing.  Anybody can price it high. 
---
Pc cdkeys are 5$. 
---
Console copies, used because why not. Are maybe 10$ at GameStop but 5$ on eBay or other resellers. 
---
No fing reason to overpay for this shitty title.
---
i do have a dedicated server at home it‚Äôs mainly for atlas
---
I'll check and reply back later when I get off work tonight, I'll be online most of the day tomorrow, I have a mule with multiples of just about every mod available in game. I see you are PS4 also.
---
&gt;oh whats that? you want to just PVP with someone for fun? better hope you got resources for repairs and caps you are willing to lose
---
I guess it‚Äôs nice living in a one room hovel with taxidermy all over.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt like it.
---
DAMNIT BETHESDA MAKE THIS HAPPEN RIGHT EFFING NOW OR WE RIOT
---
Big oof
---
That would be fantastic man, definitely! My psn is NunsWithGuns-_x if you wanna send me a friend request
---
I have both I just want a fun fight I'll pay for both players repairs
---
It is entirely possible to solo every event in the game  except maybe 94, and people have done that on the lowest difficulty.
---
4 friends (only 2 ever get on)
---
Is his name Citraw? Because he‚Äôs my friend. He has really good trades on his vendors and gave me my first ever unyielding piece. Love that guy. When I went on to his private world the other day, he reminded me of an old man. He had had a great life and achieved many things (lvl 1059) but now wanted to just rest (he was playing guitars and then went to sleep)
---
you do realize uranium can be highly dangerous while a computer running a dedicated server is not that dangerous
---
Yep Xbox
---
Great username. Lol.  PSN JamieDevito, I can accept via the app.
---
Also I won't go down so easy if at all
---
I've got nothing against it I've never seen it lol. My issue is with Bethesda being cheeky putting that tree as the only free tree. Anyone who wants a conventional tree has to pay 700 atoms.
---
Wastelanders is confirmed to be set exactly 1 year after the current time in game..yes..that is confirmed by bethesda themselves
---
::sigh::
---
Or be on a private server. Lol
---
Why are you here?
---
TP?
---
But this tree is better then some boring generic tree.
---
Do you have a source confirming 1 year later?
---
Bethesda designs a game and won‚Äôt let misdeed fix it...yer gunna haf a bad time.  
---
Pizza scissor pizza pizza. ..

Agreed
---
then it appears either A) you have an installation that anyone can perform or B) you‚Äôre asking rhetorically and could actually run your own FO server if you put your mind to it.
---
Its gotta be set to Christmas gifts or whatever to get them
---
To mock fools with what they do with their time and money.
---
Nuclear Winter is available 24/7! Leave your gear behind and show off your skills to the world! ;)
---
I found idiots were leading mobs to mine after I walled it in. 
---
Evidently it has aggrieved beyond that of camp generators...fucking insane design decision again.
---
more of B
---
They might change it for then elder scrolls online did it for every major dlc.
---
Otherwise they just drank themselves into a coma
---
I used nuke shine in a cave and got stuck where my character couldn‚Äôt move was surrounded by darkness but on the map I was near by grafton
---
No I didn't, I submitted a support ticket but as usual the response is pretty useless. It's definitely missing from the menu.
---
I had 3 of them have their disc drive fail before I just gave up on it
---
When did you grind the XP on Wednesday?
---
getting downvoted for telling the truth. classic /r/fo76
---
Those must be physical disc copies.
---
 Sorry about ripcord but karma caught up quick because i got creamed by that nuke. 
---
I think It's a two handed Melee issue.  I find the Assaultron blade to be insanely out performing the other weapons in terms of reliability and weirdly enough running attack damage.  
---
I think you misunderstood my point on Example 5 and i think i could have been clearer. This is a bit of a complex topic that goes into game design and the poor choices Bethesda made with their engine.  So bear with me.
---
 You see this third person "imaginary" reticle (which is supposed to be vector of bullet pathing) was a big issue in fallout 4. You can actually go back and see it yourself.  For fallout 76 they fixed it for the most part with guns, but they left it the exact same for melee. It's basically an issue they only partially resolved from fallout 4.  Which is why i labeled the video sarcastically "Intelligent and user friendly game design."  
---
I think we are in agreement that this is a rather big flaw with how the third person camera works and its an absolute pain in the ass when looting to. I totally agree.  It's just that some fixes were done for this issue with guns, but that same fix was not applied to how the melee bullet vector works.  Essentially the "bullet" that is fired when you swing a melee weapon originates from the characters center axis.  This does not line up or correspond with the camera or reticle which does not follow the same axis. From a development perspective this would be a 5 minute fix that they are just too lazy to do. 
---
That and using short lived bullet vectors as melee replacement is literally old school Nintendo 64 bullshit that is way outdated for today's age in gaming.  Melee should always be hitboxes. If this is an engine limitation it  too could be fixed quickly by just tweaking shotgun spread vectors.  In laymans terms a melee swing would fires a spread of short lived bullet vectors that would imitate a hitbox, then simply program a check if a vector makes contact it deploys full damage with no stacking damage for any overlapping pellets. 
---
In even simpler terms. Currently melee accuracy is an issue because you are essentially firing a pin point accurate bullet from your face that only travels 3 feet before ceasing to exist.  Melee should be instead a spread of bullets slightly wider than the character model itself checking for collision.  It wouldn't be fighting game quality hitboxes but it would be a remarkable improvement over these melee ghost hits. 
---
So while they may have a engine limitation there are creative fixes they are just simply not doing. 
---
As far as the other stuff i actually messaged and talked with the guy who had the displayed damage bug.  He didn't have blocker, dodgy, only drug on board was overdrive, didn't even have life giver, and picked up no magazines that match. So he says.  As far as i can tell this is just a genuine bug of the server just saying "nah nothing happened".   If you notice in that video it was a two handed weapon two. One handed because powerarmor but you get what i mean. 
---
Honestly yea i think the 2 handed weapons are severely bugged.
---
Late afternoon......i played for a round or 2 on thrusday morning also, but only totaled a couple hundred exp then, but havent gotten the next reward
---
Who said it was 76?!
---
definitely not me, are you close to cracking his code?
---
I don‚Äôt have 1 room- I have a whole camp- with a separate shop that is also decorated with taxidermy and other wall decor. I don‚Äôt understand what you mean I guess.
---
I‚Äôm glad people get attached to weapons. My first weapon was a .308 sniper and I have a much higher level one now, but it‚Äôs always my go to weapon
---
You could find a spot with the fast travel glitch.... LOL.
---
Of course they could just hop servers but at least you could force them to exit to the home screen.
---
I have Grahm stuck inside a cliff at one of my workshops. Chally is on top of the cliff and I can just hear Grahm talking. I FT to and from and he has not been able to move.
---
Depending on the timing, the third reward on Wednesday may not have been available yet. They're releasing later in the evening. Since you can only get 1 per day, a lot of people are grinding the XP before the reward is even available.
---
I just want dogmeat back he's like the main character of the series
---
i imagine most what you would need is a server to dish up responses then. we‚Äôre running 99% of the game on our pc/consoles. 
---
the problem in the end is players would find ways to get god rolls etc on their home servers and then take that to public servers and the game would be ruined for nearly everyone. that would be EXACTLY what dudes would do.
---
I am interested. I sort of deal in general goods but I am willing to work with the group as needed.
---
Yeah it sucks lol, luckily i can tag him in the mire, and then have my significant other finish him off and vice versa. We got the easy pass i guess. These are all being reworked around January anyways. But yep... some of the just plain suck, and aren't worth the time sink.
---
But they can't get the top rewards for that. If I'm not mistaken don't you need to do it on the hardest difficulty to obtain the strangler heart armor?....if so that is totally locking solo players out of content.
---
Yeah no thanks i want to put my build to the test
---
a way to advising that is by marking that one character save allowed on the game only
---
Ahhh...so you can only unlock 1 a day then? I wondered if that was it. But i got the wreath and the present in the same day.....maybe just timing. Ill try again tonight.
---
Why are people downvoting genuine comments?
---
A good soul to be sure!
---
Pretty sure he's a ghoul he's in every game except new Vegas
---
You can buy uranium from Amazon most reactor and bombs are made with a cobalt isotope now
---
Something similar had happened with the Halloween glasses in the past. A week or two later I saw someone wearing them paired with a bandana and helmet. Give it time and they will üëçüèª
---
At first I read that as though it's scarred the shit out of you! ü§£ I was over here like...relate.
---
I'm over 1k hours and haven't hardly touched the main quest lol. That's the glory of this game.
---
Set up pvp is beyond boring
---
Turrets just flat out go haywire a lot now. Take a workshop and max out your turrets, lol, i dare ya!
---
I can't even find it in the atom shop :))
---
Yes since Tuesday‚Äôs update. It‚Äôs a Christmas miracle!
---
and most reactors in form of nuclear power is usually fround apon
---
Just wait until they act on that hostile command and shoot you in the face lol.
---
It‚Äôs not that u can only get one per day but they r releasing the challenges one a day so each day a new challenge becomes available but if u grind at the end then all the challenges will b available
---
Don't do shot guns or melee you'll hate life
---
this is the exact thing that happened to me on Xbox One multiple times yesterday for the fan speeds up and then it just shuts off.
---
Im afraid that come January these challenges might change for the worst and will get more difficult so that it incentivizes you to spend real money though.
---
Yeah true
---
Yeah - I'd like one but don't really want to NW.
---
It would be so sweet if they added classes. This has probably been said a million times before but being able to start out as a Super Mutant, Non-Feral Ghoul, Vault Dweller, Survior or Raider each with appropriate resistances/strengths and weaknesses. It would seriously limit Adventure character variability but it would be cool for nuclear winter
---
Got it.....so i was grinding for a challenge that wasnt even there. Thanks for clearing that up. I did search and see the points breakdown for each reward, but didnt realize the rest
---
Still it's PVP I'm bored
---
 Could be. Also possible other stats may come into play and give additional options. 
---
I might have to start using my Unyielding set, lol.
---
An its not a set up it's a challenge to all
---
Same. They want a screenshot of it. Even though it's not there. Them told me to check my stash box lol
---
My girl and I will occasionally dress up in game (tuxedos and dresses) and have our characters "dance" in the ballroom whilst we do something else like cook or smoke, good place to afk for a moment or two.
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
characters are already saved console-side. and it wouldn‚Äôt matter if characters were saved server side because transmissions would be intercepted and modified anyway.
---
a ton of encryption would become necessary and the BGS would have to invest more money into that than actual game development itself. and they‚Äôd have to use a different engine and probably a few other things i can‚Äôt even think of off the top of my head.  this kind of thing just doesn‚Äôt work with massive online games. look at Pokemon Go- waaaaaaaay bigger budget, smaller files, less responses, etc and that was cracked by less than one hundred people. BGS would have to focus solely on FO to even begin to tackle that task.
---
OR
---
they could make a separate game and that‚Äôs not going to happen.
---
Part of the problem too is that there aren‚Äôt many good teams. Especially if no one has mics.  
---
I‚Äôve been a team player and a bush hider.  90% of time I do better alone.  BUT that 10% of the time I‚Äôm on a good team, it‚Äôs awesome and a way better experience.
---
Start by saying what you play on.
---
theres no magic key but... best to go is this week's raid: Keep on going until you're in the residentials there you can farm about 10 - 15 ants... when you done (and no more enemies spwaning) ft out and start all over again.  
---
It takes me about 15-20 min for 15 ants.
---
Make it cost caps and materials so that way we‚Äôd have a use for caps.
---
*all checks are Endurance-based*  
---
Aww man :(
---
(PC)  
---
1) My main - (L300) Cracklin' Bob aka "Blue Daddy" - HW/PA build with large emphasis on crafting and playing Santa (even off season) for friends and strangers. Generally playing as the friendliest Vault-Tec employee you've ever met (wear's mostly the lab coat/ white mining hat or  VT X-01 ( but no hidden agenda/experiments on friends). Nicest of my camps, rad showers, nice bathroom, "let me make you some new armor"... 
---
2) (L92) Principle Victoria -  Pistol Build/Pirate - (swapping multiple black powder pistols for max damage)   
---
Also my best trader/shop, currently featuring some nice unyielding/bolstering pieces. "why yes, I do like leather... "
---
3) (ADV L144/NW L136??) Doc Happyday - Busted pistol build now currently optimized for NW mode. (In adventure, he still uses pistols, but in NW, it's scoped and automatic rifles with GOAT LEGS because frogs are for ponds). 
---
4) (L30) Stan Derka - Mostly Rifles so far, will probably delete him when Wastelanders drops and start over. Kindof a practice run during the last double XP weekend. Made him look a lot like my dad by accident... 
---
Keeping slot 5 open in case I ever get enough friends to do a "fresh start weekend" experiment on a Private...  ;)   
---
(I've deleted 3 or 4 others, including a level 68 melee and level 167 rifle)
---
No, it's because you're being a negative so and so
---
Im not on here all the time so i wouldn't know. I was on my lunch break and thought I'd ask.
---
Dear God, I've never really had problems like this before but what even is customer support. I say one thing and they answer about something else entirely
---
Just wish you could cripple or crit the wings to force them to the ground,  you know like using tactics and skill versus dumb luck.
---
I wrote it in response to the million posts about gifts getting stolen.  The posts I keep reading are full of folks saying stuff like "wait the Santatron gives gifts?" Or need to go to a private server to escape thievery.  Thought the PSA title might grab some of those folks attention. Np, I think reddit lives to allow us all to rant now and again.
---
Whatever clip I‚Äôve got it only 10 capacity. I made a bunch of them and scrapped them and stopped getting new mods I could put on.
---
I did the same to im level 242 and i haven‚Äôt played it for a few months. Got seriously bored.
---
When? What patch?
---
the point of the game is to outlast others, so sorry if you don‚Äôt like the style but they are definitely playing the game strategically.
---
I get the same accuracy issues in third person with a gun as well. Once a target is incredibly close to you, third person will fail. Melee requires you to be incredibly close to another player, increasing the likelihood of failure. I am a first person player primarily, and the third person accuracy issue was extremely obvious when I started messing around with third person.
---
Third person makes you want to drop your "gaze" a bit to take advantage of the bird's-eye view. In first person, your "gaze" is best kept at torso or head level. As soon as you start dropping your gaze in third person, you start to risk accuracy issues. Gun or melee, it doesn't matter. The camera and the cross hair detach from one another in third person only.
---
In your camp build menu under resources. You have to get it ( for free) from Atomic shop. Can put one in your camp in ace of scraptron, and one in any workshop you own.
---
Customer support have scripts they're not allowed to deviate from nowadays, so they just pick whatevers closest
---
Yeah it's like an automated response based in key words you used.
---
Yeah, that scorchbeast that always flies over Collision Course is an easy extra commendation, too. This is a great idea
---
Maybe delete and redownload with FO76 closed, reset, try again.
---
Thanks for the info, I will probably switch around until I settle on what I like. 
---
I‚Äôm new to this reddit site and notice you‚Äôre getting down voted, I upvoted you so it didn‚Äôt show, I didn‚Äôt want you to think it was me down voting you, sorry about this, I don‚Äôt see why your posts would deserve to be downvoted it‚Äôs been helpful info and nothing that deserves a downvote imo and I appreciate it, take care!
---
Yeah I have to write the code down, then I lose it. Then I have to pick up the door and replace. With my memory, it just better to skip the middle man.üëç
---
Thank you for this idea.  It is now my mission to play this on my violin.
---
Dude I was so geeked when I got that I live in Somerset lol
---
NW has builds too. Lots of the same perks. It is more of a skill challenge though, which keeps a lot of toxic griefers in Adventure, where they can rely on their gear to do the work for them. If you're bored though, it's a great way to pass the time!
---
I'm glad you like it though especially when it's a reference to something you like it that's fair enough ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yes you have to crit, but each pellet of the crit procs the heal. Definitely need a Vats build for medic to work, no matter the weapon.
---
You got a cellphone with a camera  right?
---
Don't judge a book but it cover just wanna PVP with my new build if I wanted to play nuclear winter I would have said that
---
Good catch! I edited the post to make it more clear.
---
That increase the pellet spread to from like 8 to 12 and it suffers from damage drop off and a huge range
---
What's the new build?
---
Good point, maybe a really high platform so it is way harder to get to while the game is rendering.
---
Hey man of you're ever near Cambridge in the UK hit me up for a heartfelt baratone duet
---
You asked whether they had the same droprate, I said they did, then you link me a post saying the drop rates to items. I‚Äôve literally asked the guy who made that spreadsheet and he says they‚Äôre the same.
---
If u don't feel up to it don't reply I don't care about nuclear winter if I did it would be in the post but it's not so so your replys fall on deaf ears
---
If that's the case, then they flat out lied to everyone about making them more streamlined and easy.
---
That could work, good thinking üëç
---
No they actually stated the patch after survival dropped when the shotgun specific nerf happened they reduced ots over all range and how damage per pellet was affacted do to the weapon doubling damage to the targets
---
I thought so! Thanks.
---
Darn... guess that means Pemmican, Bourbon &amp; Bufftats for a measly +9 to my Endurance...
---
This is very good suggestion, would you mind if I wrote an article on it sometime soon?
---
If you build your CAMP right, no one is busting through.
---
Hold on... what are you asking?   
---
You **can** mix and match armor pieces (modded or not) on ANY power armor frame... For example, I have a frame with Ultracite Head, Torso and arms, but use T60 legs (because I have calibrated shocks in those t-60 leg pieces, but haven't learned that mod for Ultracite)\*.   
---
Is that what you are asking? \*\*  
---
You **cannot** use the (separate) calibrated shocks or mod plans for a T-60 on an existing Ultracite leg.  
---
\* It may be worth noting for aesthetic purposes that you can apply most/many of the atomic shop/NW paint jobs across different armor types. (I use the Outcast Paint on that mixed Ultracite/T-60 suit). Not all paints work with all armors, you may want to experiment a bit (usually requires some oil). 
---
\*\* The bonuses available specifically to the Excavator Armor in terms of weight and mining bonuses require the full suit to be used.   (confirm?)
---
I am not sure other teams can see your teams emotes? At least i have never seen a none team members emote.
---
 junkies commando with no class freak an only 2 mutations using a jffr less vats fixer
---
But then I won't earn the money for that sweet wrapping paper!! Best I can do is make it very inconvenient for you raider types. Also i set my vendor up on the edge of the forest, the weakling mobs will have a time getting through my walls,  at least while you wait you aren't stealing from anyone else. üëç
---
*where we're going we don't need eyes to see*
---
But that's just a small part of it I'm proud of it n wanna test it
---
You could have all your main power go through a single switch then just turn it off and on to get your whole camp going again.
---
That would be badass.  I'm afraid Cambridge is a bit far from Seattle, though.  But if I'm ever in town, it's on.
---
I had my santatron in a large workshop type room and didn't want to mess with my camp much.
---
I locked the workshop door and the santatron, then plopped a rocket turret down just inside the door.
---
Hope it works :)
---
what patch # did this change come with?
---
No, I live under a rock, at the bottom of sea. Seriously, my phone is just another thing to keep track of, mostly charging when I play, if my wife or one of my kids hasn't made off with it
---
Well, the shop's preview depicted it as being huge. What about keeping it outside of the mansion and not inside?
---
They aren't AT THEIR COMPUTER.   
---
That's not a strategy. That's XP and cap mining. They aren't "outlasting" anything. These aren't crafty bush wookies stealth circling the edge of the map. These are guys who plop down next to Morgantown High School's back ladder and then go get a latte\*.   
---
(\* i.e. surf porn).
---
I'll honestly let them take the presents if it's that important to them.   I'm not messing up my camp over them.  I don't even showcase any of my items, the camp budget doesn't allow me such frivolities.
---
Checking now there reaching thing is crap ive narroeed it down to between 7 and 11
---
That's similar to my newer PvP build on Xbox. Built it when I suspected they were going to nerf the Bloodied build... And then they did. With the right perks and armor, it's damn near impossible to kill you.
---
I would not mind at all, thankyou for doing so!
---
He‚Äôs like R2-D2; the *actual* hero of the entire saga.
---
neither of the things I said is false. if they're negative, then it's Bethesda's fault, not mine.
---
Any time.
---
I earned it in 2 matches. Wasn‚Äôt too hard.
---
Throwing a Molotov works.
---
well I can see your opinion has not changed. but you are wrong on one thing, if they are living longer than others then they are definitely ‚Äúoutlasting‚Äù people - in every sense of the word. the point of the game isn‚Äôt to kill people it‚Äôs to survive as long as possible. hiding is a viable strategy. simple and straightforward.
---
Only heathens don‚Äôt like Charlie Brown!
---
They would just need a loadout option the problem with that is they would have to include special but Yeah I've been hoping for a dual wielding card for pistols for a long time for a true gun slinger type toon.
---
It would also make raiders a bigger threat.
---
Feels like dual wielding was completely overlooked in fallout though.
---
Everything needs rebalancing in some way or another to make them more viable in more ways
---
Let's meet half way - central Atlantic international waters one off gig
---
Thanks. Someone tried to tell me that I can use XO1 shocks on Ultracite but I didn‚Äôt think so. I wanted to ask on here because people know everything here lol.
---
We should also be able to make the armor heavy or sturdy. I‚Äôm tired of it
---
No kidding! I got a lvl 1 instigating hunting rifle and was like wow this is amazing. But then a nope! It's level 1! If you can't tell i am pretty annoyed by it.
---
Sure.  It‚Äôd be about a paragraph too long and consist of, ‚Äú hey Bethesda, figure out how to code your damn game correctly‚Äù.  
---
Feel free to rephrase of course.
---
No.  It is a shitty game design, amongst many shitty game designs.
---
When I do, I'll try to make it as long as it needs to be.
---
Right? I think the original datamine stayed that it was a 1% chance every 7 mins (that may not be exactly right but something like that). No question they‚Äôre churning out a lot faster than that and probably overcompensating due to the time where no gifts at all were being produced. A rare win for us players.
---
Sure, but it‚Äôll be fluff and filler.
---
I will only explain what is necessary.
---
Cause greedy ass incompetent Bethesda.
---
Yes i agree with all that completely.  But if you go back to fallout 4, go into third person you will see a noticeable difference. It was so much worse in fallout 4 where even at range you had to have the reticle far right of the target.  Like two whole inches on the screen. It was hilariously bad.  And melee was just as bad.
---
What i am saying is that what we are experiencing in fallout 76 is after they "fixed" third person aim from fallout 4.  The issue remains on melee entirely unchanged from fallout 4, ranged was fixed for fallout 76 but still has very big issues up close. 
---
Basically this is a old problem that got carried over and never fixed even though you can go back and find tons of threads of people complaining about it in fallout 4. 
---
Unfortunately this only really becomes an issue because of everyone number 1 favorite thing to hate on. Froglegs.  For melee I find it basically necessary to play melee in third person because the first thing anyone does when you get within melee range of them is frogleg.  Which if you're in first person you lost sight of them immediately as they instantly go off screen and you cannot tell where they are landing.
---
I'd be willing to sacrifice the greater field of vision, because 1st person is more immersive and far more accurate, but third person is the only way to visually track a froglegger in melee range sadly.
---
Truth
---
Active challenges show up under character challenges when in nuclear winter.
---
It‚Äôs impossible to not ‚Äúbe‚Äù negative when remarking on a negative company doing negative things. 
---
Sorry mrs millennial, but sunshine , rainbows, and puppy dogs don‚Äôt all fall out of people‚Äôs asses when they shit either.
---
Damn straight
---
Might want to ask the last people that tried how that went for them.
---
Oh I know. Just wondering if they might add some kind of conflict for us with him
---
Dude, I didn't play for 8 months.  Somewhere in there.  It's vastly different than it was last year.
---
I've never seen it growing up here in the UK but guess that would make sense as I don't believe in God. The Bible is just another fictional book like Harry Potter imo
---
Where do I sign up?
---
Unless they already did and those participants are under NDA until release.

Your character looks almost as attractive without her beard.  Don't fret.

General goods are good goods! Lol

Add me on discord so I can chat with you and my other traders. Once done we can get you up and running!

Indeed ur a smart man

Incorrect. A piece of code stating (stimpak=0), uses exact same rescources as (stimpak=10000). It's just an algorithm.
---
Ps4 here and yes I got my rewards.
---
Jesus H Christ! Bravo, really, the self-control to not open them as you go deserves a reward.
---
It'd be cool if we had to level them up from level 1.
---
How do i claim it?
