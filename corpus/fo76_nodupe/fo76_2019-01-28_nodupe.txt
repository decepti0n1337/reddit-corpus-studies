I experience this on XB1 constantly
---
---
---
I hate encouraging the Atom shop, I think 80% of these should be included already
---
I have a mic, but but have voice chat set to team only. The amount of people in this game with absolute shit-tier equipment made me do it. Hearing someones heavy breathing, eating chips, crying children or i dunno, breaking stuff or living in a fucking construction site is something i don¬¥t want to hear. 
---
Its really glitchy.  You have to power both sides of the door, and a connector isnt visable on one side.  Drag power to the top center of the door and it should snap to it.  
---
A big damage buff comes from, unyielding armor. That and the 60% bonus damage fro that one perk card I forget the name of.
---
u have the resources?
---
people dropping bags and you stealing it? Attacking people at workshops? Not deastroying camps (on purpose at least) I dont see anything you should get hate mail for?
---
The jet pack was. The lamp was for 51. 
---
There is a bug from this though. I tried sharing starched genes and did not have enough Cha. So I used some mentats for the +Cha boost. It allowed me to share the card, and displays for everyone it is sharing but after a couple seconds the share just removes itself. Also the person I shared it to popped a radaway and it removed his mutation. So even if it says you have that perk for a few seconds you don't. At least that's my experience.
---
Nope. Still very much a problem.
---
Its ok.  The damage of course gets a little better, but the burn rate doesn't change...24 dmg over 3 seconds does nothing to higher level enemies.
---
I have a mic that gets used during the day. At night, my kids are asleep so I don't use it.
---
I was just trying to do one in the Ash Heap and he got stuck on a short ledge AND flame coming up from the ground. So every time he repaired himself and stood up, he went right back down, because he'd catch on fire again
---
How long are you gonna be on? I have extra flux, need a couple serums 
---
Agreed. 
---

---
I'm never going to finish that ecological balance daily.
---
 They are wrong. Its been 15 - 20 for a long time. As I said I have personally confirmed this.
---
Everyone do get corpse flower dicks though for some reason. Never figured out why. I‚Äôve gotten 3 corpse flower stamen out of the blue like 10 times while playing
---
Wait hold up, you can send tamed creatures to your camp? 
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY SKILLPOINTS
---
Wasnt finished, didnt mean to post..
---
Tv that plays the reels from Fo4 (or older games if they have them)
---
Group CAMPs would be a neat addition, not sure how to implement though
---
Decorations is also a very very big one for me. I want to display Teddies, and id rather display than use the Bobbles and Mags
---
More mods for weapons that dont have them (i.e. SMG suppressor, Crossbow scope)
---
Those ones are the big'uns for me.
---
My mic has a built in auto mute feature, I just flip the boom up or down. Its pretty sweet and the headset was only like 80.00
---
Sbq is level 95. She scales up per player. So if therea one 50ish person and a 100 something nbd. But when theres a big group of ppl and 3 ppl doing smg shes never gonna die. 
---
The events on a 30 minute timer.
---
Had this just happen the other day.  Playing with a friend and my game crashed.  Rejoined and I couldn't even restart the quest.  My friend was still on the same server, still working the quest himself.  fortunately it was only a low level one so I didn't lose much.
---
I've been told its a mod, wood doesn't inately do anything.
---
launched a nuke at whitespring this morning..ctd no fewer than 7 times within a hour. What have logged off if I wasnt with friends and able to get back to the server
---
I have seen people do this but it's not duping. When they have large groups of people farming at Whitesprings they dump of the weapons they don't want in any game object that is around (ice box or bin etc). I figure it's a way for them to not be overcumbered and they just pick whatever they want from the pile once they are done. 
---
If you see these guys they really don't have time for duping. They just wipe out whole groups of zombies, dump stuff and repeat. Some of the best gear I have is from when other people just throw weapons on the floor at Whitesprings. Because we all can't be jack of all trades when it comes to weapons, what is trash to some players build is the ideal weapon for others players build.
---
So really you either stole the loot of other players who were hard at work farming or you took somebody's trash :P
---
yeah i miss so much vault tec workshop items from fallout 4, also that cages when you can have own deathclaw, its simpler than current little broken taming system. also that elevator.. ahh current building system i so limited..
---
Scorchqueens (Endgame) are most of the time unplayable. Yesterday I did 2, 1 the server was glitching out that damage to everything was just being reduced so queen didn't die, and everyone was just getting wrecked. The second; The game was lagging so much (wasn't just me, I could hear others talking about it on their mics) that I would be taking dmg and see the attacker 5 seconds later, shoot, and miss because it wasn't where I shot. Again, everyone around was just dieing.
---
I lost all my loot and the scorchqueen gave me a 1* LVL 50, that's it! *Shakes fist in the air*
---
"JOOR ZAH FRUL!"
---
I'm on there as well, original Xbox One with an external SSD for storage. 
---
Mod, but to anyone else they look dirty... 
---
I'd love to see a statistics page. I want to see how many enemies I've killed since I usually play solo yet the game still likes to surround me with 20 enemies at all times.
---
I'd also like them to update the whole storage system. There can still be the stash boxes where you can keep stuff that you might want to access later at a vendor, but there's really no reason to put anything other than a stash box in your base, since other forms of storage aren't secure. It would be cool to have different types of storage that hold specific things. Like an ammo box that can hold fusion cores, missiles, and mini nukes. Or a refrigerator that you can power that keeps food from spoiling, or a power armor display that would keep it from automatically going back into your inventory or keep if from taking up space in your stash box. 
---
Spriggans on crack
---
just got off to take a break be back on in 30-40 min
---
That's odd.  I've seen 3 nukes on a server but not at once.  I've also seen a nuke zone completely finish.  There's still stability issues but they've come a long way so far.
---
Sadly its energy damage which is only useful on robots.
---
Flair.  Click on your name in the response above that you posted and it will offer an add flair.  There are a few to choose from.
---
Yep same the last one. The other level 100+ stopped after the first time she regened health back.  I kept on, got her to about 30% health but it was hopeless.  The others couldn't even keep the adds down.  In the end I had to swap to TSE shottie to clean up.
---
Well like i said it was the first tume i ever did it so it was some trial and error. I did take hacking and lockpicking.
---
Gotcha 
---
We don‚Äôt know for sure that she died from her injuries, do we? If she did die, it‚Äôd be a closure if we could find her corpse.
---
Ah so I can‚Äôt match in power armor - since I‚Äôd need unyielding 
---
Sbq scales up per player in the zone. So 1 more player of any level increases her hp a bunch.
---
Proof of ban or it never happened.
---
Teach me the shout master, I am not a scorchborn.
---
Same issue when I moved my camp yesterday my megasloth has disappeared and still taking 20% of budget.   
---
  For those wondering how to tame creatures just search this subbreddit been many posts about it and also you can search youtube. 
---
üëç
---
I don't see this as being any different than players who broadcast their music over their mics. 
---
There are still ways too kill this build, you just need to hit them with a high rate of fire until their AP is drained which isn‚Äôt difficult as they literally won‚Äôt move 
---
I got 2k in caps to buy one psn same as here
---
Best you can do is use rank 1 of starched Gene's and hit the rad shower.. takes them off 1 at a time instead of all at once.  But it's still random.
---
That‚Äôs what I would love: break down ammo into raw materials and make diff ammo. Even if it only gave half the materials back that would be dope.

Seperate stash boxes might not be necessary because of the tabs.
---
But stash boxes available to the public would be a nice touch.
---
In fact you could do a lot with a public access loot box. A whole lot.
---
Nice üòé
---
I saw you kill a few griefers, thanks.
---
I‚Äôm still confused how an Eyebot can be diseased. It‚Äôs a robot, and it only shoots lasers, which obviously can‚Äôt carry diseases
---
Because they don't drop nor do syringers, it's simple hyperbole.
---
I‚Äôve been having a bunch of texture glitches, like flickering and stuff
---
Yeah but would you download more ram?
---
Have you tried moving the stairs inside of scraping them?
---
Assuming they don't kill you while you are trying to drain their ap
---
And what idea would it be? To Alienate the people that have been buying for games for decades?
---
I believe it should show up so you can see it. You can try equipping and unequipping to see if it changed. Since I think once you unequip it would lose that effect. Unless it gets the effect while sitting in your inventory which I am not sure about.
---
They wouldnt have to if they put the proper effort in the first time.
---
But youre right.
---
I just finished this quest and got 100 bobby pins from 1 loot crate and 50 stimpaks from another! I finished up the quest and slowly made my way back to my camp overemcumbered. I couldn't believe it!

Ticket #/Question Reference # 190124-004888
---
I can not play more than a minute or two, and only walk 50-100 meters and I disconnect. I thought it was server outages, or perhaps my computer. I did all the troubleshooting I could figure would help, then to confirm it's my character that's bugged.. I made a new one, the new one is fine..
---
I don't want to start from scratch, my character that keeps disconnecting and is now un-playable is level 53, took ages, don't overly want to do it again...
---
Any tips would be very much appreciated.
---
\-MBV
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah, but the tse nerf will help massively with this 
---
Or the other excuse hear a lot "Its in the game" 
---
Again you're not understanding. Taking a digital copy that leaves the existing one with no discernable difference to the creator or thief is NOT the same as stealing a person's credit cards and draining a person's available credit balance. One leaves the inventory exactly as is and the other reduces money available to spend. I'm not arguing about the moral of it just stating the fallacy in the argument. 
---
I am sad everytime I see an Auto Gernade Launcher. It's the only heavy weapon I can't carry because the perk doesn't work on it, they are a fun gun to use.
---
Yes I read somewhere that bear arms used to work on it but when they nerfed it early on it changed the heavy gun flag properties of it.
---
I did, but I got the same message saying the floor won't be accessible 
---
You have never sone a silo before or do it regularly. Reading comprehension...  2 houra over all and yes, it was the  first time ive launched my own. Not the first time ive been to a nuke zone. Smh..
---
 I don't understand. I make all my own ammo and its fine. You need lead and steel. ;') Plastic for Shotgun Shells.
---
 Now I pick up what I will use but leave the rest there.
---
Yea that‚Äôs one huge disadvantage since you can get well over 25+ strength with it.
---
are you sure it is the stairs keeping that bit of floor inplace and not one of the other bits of floor around it?
---
\-equips cards
---
\-equips calibrated shock x-01 (or even more with excavator)
---
\-has 500 weight. over 600 with excavator. I also have 140 weight left in my stash. just learn to manage better.
---
If they'd just give a garden plots we wouldn't need Pyroponics Gardens
---
You‚Äôre right. I used the wrong value to calculate the second anti armor effect.
---
That‚Äôs what I get for multitasking.
---
The Mire.
---
I mean.....you can do a few maps and typically get that plan....its a common map plan to get.
---
We should be able to add chem effects to the arrows. Wether the effect is good or bad. Can help apply the effect to a friendly mid battle, or mess with an enemy.
---
Make that a level 125+ mission to keep the end game expanding. 
---
lol Two shot explosive guns have completely ruined this game. Take legendaries out ffs
---
I tried scrapping nearly everything around there but it's still stuck 
---
Sure I'll just equip my power armor as I'm loading in to a server 
---
Yes you're right! So if I equip my sledge, the mutants bat displays 223. When I equip the bat, it updates to 245. However, it updates my unequipped items to a 10% boost, showing my sledge at 270. However when I swap to it it corrects to 245. That's good info to know
---
Thank you
---
I don't know what you are playing on but I do probably 10 plus queens a day and I have not had any problems. I actually have not dced or glitched out once. I only notice problems going into whitespring bunker on the black screen and on a few occasions had crash or two. I play on a Xbox one X with a really fast connection and really dont notice very many issues. especially game breaking ones. Sorry to hear it is such a bad experience for you. :(
---
No crispy squirrel bits?
---
I‚Äôve had this same thing happen at least twice. I‚Äôve also have multiple people wasting my time pretending they want to buy something from me and when I charge 10caps for plans they back out.
---
Or you could just buy the plans from other players 
---
You can put the hand water pumps on Camp Fires. Just push the pump out toward the edge of the camp fire 
---
Don't forget to but some *supplies*
---
The mole miners are terrifying enough, no thanks!
---
I had this issue a couple of times
---
Yeah you have to wait for the game to load around you before you open your pip boy. 
---
I feel ya mate. Been hopping the Enclave for over 25-30 hours now for the Calibrated Shocks mod for X-01 PA. Need 2, got 1.
---
This system is so fucking stupid, bit now i‚Äôve done it so much that i just can‚Äôt quit till i get it.
---
Nope the buildable cave check my final rendition post if you feel so inclined :)
---
Yes, my crime is great. I am off to commit sudoku.
---
As per another person pointing this out I'm going to commit sudoku for my crimes.
---
I honestly believe the way the netcode works it has some issue with saving unneeded information. I really notice a difference after patches when they take the servers down and reset them. It will be super smooth and good for a couple days and it seems like it starts getting bogged down. I am not a techy. Maybe someone with more knowledge could elaborate if servers can store information they don't need and become slowed down by it?
---
Yep i run the same, its hilarious as hell, I can get a huge bounty and nobody can kill me unless I run out of ap
---
I can think of plenty of people to delete. Murderers, rapists, that guy from work whos face I dislike.
---
You probably have to scrap from the outside in, it won't let you scrap stairs. Can you add stairs somewhere else? If so, it should let you scrap that set. Otherwise you're stuck with it, or you have to just move your camp an inch and start again. 
---
Someone reads. Thank you. Tired of theae kids yeesh.
---
It is an explosive gun so it wouldn't get any benefit from the heavy gunner perks and would get extra damage from the demolition perk, yes.
---
What they are talking about is the Bear Arms perk which reduces the carry weight of heavy weapons doesn't work on it. The perk reduces the carry weight of the rocket launcher, broadsider and the fatman and it used to work with the auto grenade launcher but it doesn't anymore.
---
I'm sure everyone would quit your right. I jus dont like the reliance on them is all and I'm sure I'm alone  in my opinion. Yes I have my own ledendary weapons and even some underwhelming legendary raider armor lol but. I feel I if i dont have something tse or anti armor or some ridiculous awesome combo of I wont stand a chance which I've won fights and lost some but it was all luck of who was more stacked I feel. 
---
Yeah, this has happened to me also. It has something to do with that particular kind of arrangement, where a set of floor tiles are surrounding a hole in the center with stairs. Obviously a failure in the algorithm. I had to move camp and store all items, losing the temporary blueprint.
---
Not many good perks from it.... my 3rd character has 15 luck and i can't take HALF of the perks i want from that tree.  Bloody mess,  scratched genes,  class freak, evasive, psychopath, quick hands, both the armor repair and weapon repair perk, grim reaper sprint, better crits, 4 leaf clover...
---
hmm? oh i guess cuz im on a roadtrip atm and the service is wacky. must have loaded twice. 
---
me too man like inside of houses where it is supposed to be black for a second will go all green and pink. I notice the smoke effects from mutations i have come off really pixelated sometimes and like fully green or pink. I also notice where light is supposed to be it is just like a white overlay that looks really bad that flickers. These things were not as apparent before the last patch so I hope it get's fixed.
---
... username is gone...
---
I think the gods did get him in the end...
---
People sont seem to know she scales. Apparently lota of free loaders in f76. Damn they got tse bloodied anus real quick.
---
That's what I was doing with the top entrance but got annoyed that in order to make the block "replaceable" it also allows that certain amount of AOE damage through and with my top level being a "club" the constant small repair costs got annoying.
---
And then the only attacking PVP in Adventure mode should be in contesting a Workshop ownership. Want to fight more than that? Move to Survival mode!!!!
---
Yeah im on PS4. I can understand if it was me, and my connection. That's on me
---
But the queen was taking very very minimal dmg from everyone, and the second I could hear everyone complaining. Sometimes it's ok, but alot of the time lag, body containers take forever to load, so I never anything but the scorchqueen and scorchbeasts, and even then sometimes I see everyone waiting for like 5-10min, waiting for the loot to load-in
---
Yeah and it's a nice way to put the blame on others, when you probably can't handle it yourself. How do you fare against a regular Scorchbeast? What's your build and weapons? If it's taking you 2 hours to do the silo, I think you're probably also one of the weak links in the chain, expecting others to come and carry you.
---
fixed it. just for youuuu
---
Also if you move your camp multiple times it will charge 40, 80, then cap at 160 for each consecutive move without waiting a bit. It will always say "40" in the pip-boy.
---
You have to stagger them with melee or high rof weapon to drain ap fast enough. I run the same build, i use fireproof+dense, full assassin sentinel armor, dodgy, and lone wander. I don't use serendipity but I still take zero damage while standing still in pvp and a tiny bit of damage in pve.
---
I've heard that the next patch will include changes to the loot tables, so things like the handmade rifle plans will be able to spawn at higher levels and more vendors. Hopefully this will include the BOS armor, too. I have the opposite of your problem, I found the arms and legs quickly, but the BOS chest hasn't shown up after weeks.
---
Bobbleheads stack, there are bobbleheads that increase explosive damage
---
Calling all responders Sanjay here 
---
-.-  
---
Why are you so butt hurt lol honestly. I actually did the codes on my own instead of googling it. 
---
well everytime someone else joins the event the queen get's more resistances and more hp and dmg. So if you have 20 people but only 5 are geared enough to actually hurt her or do good damage you are screwed.
---
I use the large tent and keep a bed, a tinker's workstation, a cabinet, TV and the camo module in it (and a fan light on top).
---
The trick with placing things in the tent is to keep looking down and keep the object you are placing close to you and you should be able to put it down.
---
Also dense and fireproof, makes explosive weapons tickle
---
Think tormentor would be worth it on something like a auto handmade with a drum mod or similar
---
Not sure. 
---
I completed it by doing the Uranium Fever event. There's three legendaries there that count for sure.
---
Damn bro what happened?
---
It appears to only trace one path in one direction to calculate what will be accessible instead of a simple forked set of even two paths, in this kind of specific scenario at least.
---
 LOL. Sell it. Its an SMG and as useless as most Legendaries. ;)
---
The brotherhood formed from military members after discovering the base they were guarding was experimenting with the F.E.V. They saw it as inhumane practices guided by a corrupt system. They planned to go awal and stop the abominations of science they were making. When they began their plan the bombs dropped. They were successful in killing the scientist's at the base. With the destruction of the bombs chose to form the brotherhood to prevent any more act's like that from being created. At the same time the u.s. high ranking politicians, scientist's and military officials fled to safe house's to wait till they can regain power and rebuild. The enclave was made. The people that commanded the experiments that founded the brotherhood. Are the same people in the enclave.  So yes there is an opposing millitary faction to the brotherhood.
---
I've got unyielding armor for all my limbs, plus the perk Radicool (more rads = str), plus power armor, and a base of 15 (max) strength. I can get upwards of 33+ strength. Not to mention when I roid out on all the buffouts.
---
Btw, if you equip armor/under armor it'll unequipp upon entering PA. Buuuut, after entering PA if you quit and rejoin, you'll have your armor and stuff equipped under the PA. That way you'll get all that stat bonuses.
---
No you....
---
Happened to me yesterday. Some fucking asshole who probably bought his fucking double barrel TSE of off ebay joins right before the 1st legendary and started  one shoting everything. 
---
Then later another mother fucker decided to follow me around for a while shooting me in the back with his TSE doing zero damage.  Idiots
---
Ive put a lot of time into this game, im sitting at 115 and have killed a fuck ton of legendaries and the best weapon ive gotten is a freaking two shot dragon that breaks after 6 shots.
---
Legendary squirrel.
---
Okay.
---
That has horror movie plot written all over it... if only it was bloodied as well. 
---
I don't think any plans that spawn are affected by player level. I am not sure if there  are plans attached to lower level quests that you cannot acquire elsewhere.
---
pyroponics! hahaha
---
I'll definitely try the inside out method, I haven't done that yet
---
Damn you're naughty. 
---
Oh ok thank you just wondering :o
---
No, that's wrong. Dupers are like the new owners of a store, who paid it in cash, taking products off their own shelves and using them at home. Dupers bought the game, so they aren't stealing anything.
---
THIS THIS THIS THIS. 
---
You ve just been playing the game mate, nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs their problem for being upset of something they were warned could happen and not being able to defend it
---
Well they are starred enemies. So if they have a star beside their name you should be getting the enclave recommendations.
---
I‚Äôm sure if we spring boarded ourselves from the top down and launched every single piece of explosives into your roof it will get blow a hole all the way through your house into China. 
---
Aaah i forgot, the codes just reset didnt they? 
---
last patch was on a thursday. thursday is the 31st. only time frame giving was by the end of the month.
---
It is said handmade plans are restricted to 20-35. I have never seen those plans and I am now triple those levels. I can only conclude from my experience that they are indeed level capped
---
I'm on console so I had no idea. Lucky!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call you an asshole that‚Äôs part of the game. I do the same as you even when I hunt bounties, I always stand over their bag and let them get their stuff back unless it‚Äôs a duper. 
---
Yea but you duping your items kills enjoyment for anyone on your server. Your literally killing the fun of others for your own enjoyment. That‚Äôs fucked up. Who play a multiplayer online game if your just gonna cheat and spoil the fun for others. I genuinely get sick of coming on this sub and seeing people like you who don‚Äôt take personal responsibility for there actions. You are ruining this game for others just because you can that‚Äôs what it comes down to.
---
K I'm down let's do it you name bet
---
That‚Äôs not griefing. Killing enemies that try to kill you IS NOT griefing
---
I'm in the first camp. Well said.
---
you would have completed it as long as the low amount of anything that was around didn't make it to the island. Certain events really need a increase in how many monsters spawn that is for dang sure.
---
God is dead, and we killed him.
---
Credit where credit is due, tho. That snipe at the end.
---
Hopefully it'll be a fix in the next patch, although I'm not holding my breath 
---
They really need to let us add the cult decorations to the camps, all that mothman cult and lucky hole mine stuff would make a cool creepy camp.
---
Yeah I never found them myself thankfully a friend gifted them to me 
---
I play PC because I‚Äôm master race dawg. 
---
I don‚Äôt fuck with the peasantry consoles.
---
Or a pump shotgun with a long barrel is probably better for accuracy tse won't hurt either 
---
Nice i have that too,, iv'e not looked into those yet as i have a 4x4 3up mushroom shaped train signal box that has been wired up with switches n stuff all neatly on 5 connecters ,, im lazy :) ,  i guess the trick is a newbie workaround for those without the plan :)
---
I also believe you need a terminal for some of the advanced connecters so its about weighing that up against the camp budget and what you want in your camp.. Im currently hunting for a pet wich is 10% budget so i need too be minimalistic if i want - crafting tables, defence, pet/s, decon shower, decorations, power &amp; lights... i need to look into the budget cost a bit more perhaps the advanced connecters may free up some budget :)
---
Thanks for the good fight!
---
Right, so this is buggy.
---
On the topic of these - how do they function in your camp? Does it have random junk every day or is it basically a different looking stash box?
---
A thousand times yes this is an incredible idea 
---
Lol. Bet you're fun at parties.
---
deal, what kind of price break can I get on 2 max level torsos everything from scratch 
---
Its coming to an end my friend. The last few weeks have been nothing but assholes with their ebay TSEs ruining the game. Ill be glad when Metro (Feb) and MK11 (Apr) drop. Fuck this online cheating shit 
---
Don't feel too upset - it's not giving rewards on completion either lately.  Just a blank "Event Completed" tag.
---
This.I have the same issue this is the solution.
---
Some are.
---
Handmade is at harpers ferry. Then it switches to....lever i think then lastly radium rifle.
---
I've got one I'll trade for 10mm, .45, and 5.56 ammo.
---
You can get rid of your mutations one at a time at a radiation shower such as the one in the Blackwater mine, but it's very risky as it's random, so you can't manually choose which mutation of yours that you'd want to get rid of. You could end up losing your best mutation if you decided to try and get rid of the one you don't like, but it really depends on which ones you have at the moment. If you have either Marsupial or Speed Demon, I wouldn't risk it. Just get the Class Freak perk card, fully level it up, and any bad mutation you have won't be pain to you anymore.
---
Yeah all I ever see is radium rifle now
---
The last inside the vault didn't mention anything so maybe next week's will.
---
How much ammo we talking
---
Different looking stash box.
---
Whoa. Sounds like you have a conflict with not understanding my build. I'm a 15STR/15Luck. Half of those you listed only apply to me. 
---
Starched, bloody, better crits, class freak, savior All max and 1 point for whatevever. 
---
Can swap anything out with Savior as it's not needed but it is welcomed.
---
My build does not rely heavily on VATs, not even fighting a SBQ so all the vats perk cards limit the build.  
---
When I use shotgun, heavy or rifles, I can swap to those cards however if need be. 
---
But, I stand by that statement. There are not that many great Luck Based Perk Cards compared to other categories and their utility.
---
Stash box
---
&gt;  Same with refilling fusion cores 
---
'Thats a glitch ??. I just figured it was some sort of recharging system' 
---
That's my story and I am sticking to it. 
---
The lvl100+ assholes with TSEs that are showing up there aren‚Äôt newbies
---
Heard this in the Mayor's voice.
---
At low levels that's how common the handmade is.
---
On my alt i found 3 in 5 hops.
---
But the enclave existed before the war (and was the org conducting the FEV experiments and even had a hand in vault-tec) while there were military personnel (mainly higher ups) in the enclave my point was more that they weren't so much pulled together remnants like the brotherhood but the "chosen few" And was more pulled from the civilian side than the military side.
---
In the end why didnt more brotherhood type groups start up (if only to be swallowed up by the brotherhood)?
---
&gt;  id assume.
---
Didn't never tell you what happens when you ass u me ?? 
---
It has a set spawn location 
---
Eh, 1k or so.  I'm not looking for blood.  Whatever you're not using is fine.
---
The Flatwoods Monster. I still haven't seen it.
---
What I don‚Äôt understand is if people already have these alpha weapons why the hell are they still farming legendary weapons? 
---
Just file a sound exchange report and pay your fees. 
---
And if we are calling out how many characters we have been through, I've done 9 now to level 100 with each one a different build. 
---
Luck is a great stat to have, but it honestly doesn't have too much to offer. 
---
I want a bayonet on mine
---
Lettme check what i got
---
Which mod can I pm regarding something I encountered, and don't feel like posting publicly, in case it's mis-used?
---
I‚Äôll hunt them. That‚Äôs Harper‚Äôs ferry, yeah?
---
Mine was lower levels that got ahold of TSEs uranium fever and white springs. Even when I‚Äôm almost done killing one they will finish it and I won‚Äôt get the loot. Gets me saltier than rainbow six siege
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I know.  They're the ones farming the newbies.
---
It spawns at Solomon's pond where the behemoth is for me pretty regular.
---
Sloths.
---
Only seen them in nuke zones.
---
If you log out at white springs or at the fissure EXPECT to automatically be in a nuke zone. This is common sense for F076. however the latest couple locations I have seen nukes at are not lol. (Harpers Ferry/Morgantown) but I will be suited up if I log out near them now. 
---
Legendarys do drop Syringers have gotten two in the last week.
---
Ok i got 1000 45 rounds and 196 308 if thats cool
---
Let me get you some butthurt cream so you can soothe the pain you are feeling right now.
---
im just assuming because im not sure what kind of logs Bethesda keeps. Im just familiar with how you can go about detecting these things. For all i know Bethesda has no logs and has no way to track anything but thats worst case scenario. 
---
About the time I get one to legit drop
---
Join our enclave discord for some fellow PS4 players that are down to do it. Send a PM if you want the url
---
I had that happen to me once I ended up moving my whole damn camp
---
Boohoo. 10 level 100+ didn't come to carry me on my first nuke launch at Fissure. I'm so upset now I will come to reddit to cry. It was all that perky level 6's fault I tell you!
---
With mods it was one of the best utility Items....official mod support soon please.
---
Grahm
---
Yeah man, as soon as Metro and MK11 get here my ass is gone
---
Grow the fuck up
---
I'm a level 93 and I've only killed two Mothmen and Flatwoods monsters so I'd day those. I'm sure they have set spawns but this is my experience from constant roaming.
---
The most basic thing we need for camps:  A "Welcome!" sign and a "No Trespassing!" sign.
---
Yeah, I know there's a "Welcome home" sign, but I hate it.
---
Thank you! I know where I'm headed after work.
---
Bad to the bone 
---
Ghoul with last laugh perk card
---
Fallout 4 was my first fallout, I was so happy and hyped to hear another one was coming ...but uh you can see how disappointing that was
---
He glimpsed the inventory as his cursor moved by but didn't have time to properly recenter and loot it.
---
No tomorrow 
---
Awesome! On my way to the silo
---
I find handmade plans still at lvl 168 
---
Guess what where insurance companies would put their weight?
---
There are problems in their domain and it is up to them to show responsibility and fix it. Any outsider can only wait. Let's hope for Bethesda's sake and their future that they solve it. If not, I am afraid there will no bricks left.
---
Thx for that
---
You need help. 
---
I read about a guy downloading and printing a Jaguar XJ so yes,  people would absolutely do it.
---
the hermit crab hidden in the delivery trucks,  I've only seen 1 so far 
---
Yeah, I'm getting horrible disconnects and freezes as well.  It hasn't been like this until recently.  Playing less and less.
---
A human npc 
---
That makes sense to a point
---
Monday night around 7 they reset 
---
It‚Äôs a good idea. People would have to make choices on which gear they are going to use based on accepting that they might lose it. You wouldn‚Äôt see people running around with all their best stuff all the time but you‚Äôd at least get a good weapon most of the time. 
---
Already in full forest scout, polymer with lead or deep pocket on all, but am on pc.
---
It does increase your explosive damage, it just doesn¬¥t show on the card. Energy weapons that normaly only deal energy damage only show the energie damage on the card. Explosive damage is ballistic, so your explosive damage (and the increase of course) stays hidden. 
---
At one point they were giving instructions on how to block hits, what button to push
---
I also had the exact same issue it ended up with me getting so fed up I rearranged my furniture in my house and now my tv is closer and I can read the fine print. I do miss the little hit the "x" button on Xbox to switch over to the pipboy text over the paper so it becomes readable
---
Thanks!

"Mmm, best walking foods: Dry meat.. Mhm..  Dry meat. Roast meat. Charred meat. Skewered meat. Squishy meat. Crispy  meat. Fishy meat. *Stinky* meat. Rotten meat. Ikky meat! Brown meat.

Did I miss any, Moo Moo?"
---
Oh I'm sure they can get a `virus`. 
---
Ah yes!
---
It was inexcusable that the duping glitches were left in the game for over a month and a half.
---
Holy shit yeah! Once I‚Äôm done with building it I want nothing to do with Welch ever again haha
---
Save it for the OP and yourself. You need it more.
---
Live and learn.
---
The servers can't handle polling servers to find you a nice spot to log in to.
---
Especially if you're logging off in the most common place to nuke in the game
---
The rarest variant I‚Äôve seen would probably be the albino variant on a deathclaw 
---
OMG stop trying to equate this with something else ... I happen to love this game and enjoy the grinding for stuff including legendaries.  If this were not an MMO I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with duping, however, because this is an MMO duping is ultimately bad for the player community at large for a couple of reasons ... for one thing it‚Äôs causing the servers to crash ... c‚Äômon do you really need 10K of anything?  For another it prevents any kind of in-game economy from establishing itself...  I think this is a case where the needs of the few shouldn‚Äôt outweigh the needs of the many
---
Only within the last 2 weeks have I had any negative experiences with people in the game.  Camp trasher, baiters with buddies in stealth, and TSE people trying to kill my lowbie character.
---
I think as the game ages with little content and few annoyance/bug fixes, people will either take a break or turn to griefing to entertain themselves.  I knew the good times or my luck wouldn‚Äôt last forever, because I‚Äôve had so many situations where people are going out of their way to be friendly and helpful.
---
Then we can use the neon letters to write on the walls of our camp "N handmade O read" in big and in smaller letters you add the detailed offer. 
---
People don‚Äôt enough appreciate the subtle steering effect the game‚Äôs design decisions (like no-human-NPC‚Äôs, and the otherwise lonely human-less world) has on setting up and guiding real-player interactions.
---
I think this is something they consciously set up. 
---
Dang
---
And where is his camp placed at? 
---
No. Because that doesn‚Äôt happen. 
---
I might think i had failed but i don't remember if i manajed to.
---
A Player with caps 
---
Me too
---
Huge damage reduction would be fine
---
And I'm not mad I lost just after 6 shots and he is still at full life is ridiculous
---
I read this earlier, went to play and guess what?  This happened to me!  Spawned at Whitespring and instadeath because it was a nuke zone.  Lesson learned, when leaving game at Whitesprings, dress in Hazmat suit or get into power armour before leaving the game.
---
[removed]
---
Mothman, and Flatwoods monster. I've only encountered the Mothman once, and not yet encountered the Flatwoods monster. I'm lvl 230...lol
---
He has it placed just a bit off Seneca Rocks
---
Yup yup. 
---
THIS!  And some of us would do "Mod's" Work and bury those fucking TSEs in the middle of a lake so no one would ever find them before the server resets.  There, problem solved and no server wipe required.  You're welcome Bethesda!
---
Go straight to the high level areas lien the ash heap bog mire etc.. team up with a high level on your server so you can get 1-2 hits on the enemy before he kills it you‚Äôll level up really fast. Have fun in Appalachia! :)
---
Sorry, I'm new at this!
---
Watoga is by far the easiest to farm T-51 and T-60. 
---
You're the one who is throwing salt at everyone, and judging by those downvotes people don't really like what you have to say, now take the butthurt cream and go.
---
Except there's nothing that's stopping him from taking all your stuff then leaving the world.
---
If you think you will end up using machine guns get try and get the handmade plans in watoga before you hit lvl 25.
---
But hey at least we got a castle bed now, right?
---
what time zone? Im in europe
---
Those giant sloth things
---
Yeah they're stupid unless you're going to play for like 4 hours straight and don't crash.  And then you'd better hope someone lvl 10000 doesn't come to take it.  I don't even bother anymore, like most other systems in the game it's half baked.
---
it is not a AAA quality. don't get me wrong you can have fun but have realistic expectations. it is buggy as hell and crashes all the time. don't walk in thinking it is anything that it isn't. then no disappointment, and have fun.
---
Congratulations! You have been selected to begin your vault career as... ... ... processing ... ... ... ... [First through the door]! This exciting occupation involves [ensuring survival of others by testing the air, water, livability and survivability of the local area before mass vault exodus]! Sounds great doesn‚Äôt it?! See the [Head of Security] for the [BB gun] you‚Äôll need to start your new future!

This in an incorrect understanding of libertarian principles.  Libertarians believe 110% in supporting each other, helping the community, doing good for society, etc.  They just strongly disagree with being FORCED to do so by GOVERNMENT through the govts monopoly on force.  
---
CardenasJay?
---
What platform?
---
Pick the perk cards that'll reduce your carry weight for chems, junk and food. Get those first
---
There's also a spawn on the skeleton riding the carousel horse at the Freak Show
---
Only time my camp gas ever been attacked, it was my own turret. Cane back to a mostly destroyed Camp and a turret that was aggro towards me...got rid of turrets after that
---
Plant monsters?
---
Try to have your camp in a low traffic area. And while at your camp stay crouched [HIDDEN] and people can‚Äôt see your dot on the map. Try to not stay on the server for too long. It‚Äôs best to embrace server hopping and just make it a habit. 
---
I want a Sheriff
---
Yes! Eliminate server hopping to reset things like this!
---
That was eastern time zone so around 1 am for you 
---
FWIW: most of your complaints are about the PVP and endgame content.  If you just ignore that aspect and play the game as a solo player exploring Appalachia... it's really not so bad.  The physical world building is really well done, and the backstory is... not great but really not bad.  And it's all very Falloutey.  The bits I find missing are the gonzo aspects, which really only work with NPCs.  I want a Mechanist (either one) and an AntAgonizer.  I want the Big-MT.  I want to solve the mystery of Covenant.  And there's none of that; everything in the backstory is played distressingly straight.
---
Are you trying to server hop?
---
I didn't know you could fail
---
Griefers wet dream possibly. But good idea none the less
---
Im not sure im correct i know its 7pm for east coast united states 
---
Funny. People complain that players are "stealing" by duping. For a good example of  **actual** stealing, check out Bethesda. 76 is a clusterfuck. 
---
Honestly, I play it like a single player game still, it just happens to have internet weirdos come wandering though occasionally.  
---
Sometimes they're annoying, sometimes they're a godsend, but they always add an element of unpredictability.  Sometimes they say nice things about my CAMP even, which is very nice!
---
If you end up using a meele build do  mayor for a day at lvl 50 
---
You and the OP are the only ones that need it. And I don't judge by easily manipulated systems and what shills have to say. You see, your new account, with a lot of karma here came from a few posts that required you ti wipe the "cream" from your chin afterwards.
---
Gunners, maybe? I know they're only in F04, but they act kinda like a corrupt military unit.
---
Ppl can't see you on the map if you're crouched??!!
---
How about pvp? Capture the flag (or vault)? Domination? Race to nuke drop? Global/local/friends high scores in pipboy games. There are so many areas lacking and left for improvement.
---
Maybe they'll sell us some add-ons down the line. 
---
I think take your path, enjoy everything from quests to exploration, you don't need to farm levels fast.
---
The game is much better when you enjoy it slowly
---
2 nukes don‚Äôt even change anything. Sorry, the only difference is between one nuke and no nuke 
---
That has not been my experience. In FO4 I was hood rich and could freely buy anything I wanted, anytime I needed it. This was because I could invest in the vendor and I also had numerous settlements with crops and water purification to sell. At anytime I had between 40-60k caps on me and it was glorious.
---
there is few in whitespings near the sevice entrace of enclave.
---
If you‚Äôll be on tonight (maybe an hour or two?) I will grab a few serums from you 
---
The one at Sutton that does the impersonation of Robert De Niro, in Taxi Driver, is funny.
---
I had forgotten about that guy.  I remember wondering about him after I finished the quest.
---
Nah. Would be much easier to have them take the place of the grass, or to exist already and simply be 'invisible' in a sense. To be able to destroy them would open up ways to grief and probably make other cool little things to be trickier to pull off.
---
Mid- and high-level players who don't use a TSE weapon.  
---
In all seriousness, Graham and the Charleston Vendor Bot are hard to find. Pied Piper EyeBot is rare also.
---
Killed a 3* legendary ghoul, it healed itself and everything, so no glitch. Wanna know what it dropped? A regular flare gun... 
---
This suddenly makes so much sense...
---
lag is my issue today - pick up junk and the sound activates 4 seconds later. Stab a scorch it still runs about for 5 seconds and then dies. Once I leave the 'world' it says disconnected from server.
---
Bummer :(
---
If a higher level player comes up to you, don't run away. They may drop a bag of goodies for you. 
---
Found it on youtube afterwards just to write down the whole thing. There is one word I wasn't able to understand, I guess that was "26. wormy meat". And I wrote "Dark meat" instead of your "21. porked meat", "Faulty meat" instead of your "13. salty meat", "ikky meat" instead of your "10. pinky meat". And I got a "Sugary meat" that you didn't.
---
"Mmm,  best walking foods: Dry meat.. Mhm..  Dry meat. Roast meat. Charred  meat. Skewered meat. Squishy meat. Crispy  meat. Fishy meat. *Stinky* meat. Rotten meat. Ikky meat! Brown meat.

---
I love it!
---
Its the thrill of the chase and if/when they get one, its a dopamine rush. It literally reminds me of gambling as I am addicted to trying to seek the holy grail(s) legendaries.
---
I had a Yao-gui that died on it's way to my camp and when I fast traveled there today he was in my workshop taking a nap.
---
You can't, that's what I was getting at üòÖ
---
I'm going to disagree with /u/Mrdiamond01 
---
Take your time. Enjoy the world. Read the notes. Listen to the holotapes. Experience the game. 50 comes fast enough just doing the normal quest stuff. Bethesda did a good job of making the world feel right, even without human NPCs. 
---
Once you hit 50, you don't really "progress" any further. You can get new perk cards, but no additional points. Although you *can* opt to move a point every level instead of new perk card. Gear maxes out at 45 or 50 (depending on the item). Rushing to 50 takes any sense of challenge out of most of the primary quest line.  
---
I agree I have over 2k 308 rounds and nothing to use them in
---
I think we may have finally found a use for the Syringer.
---
Mole miners are bitches after they are outta rockets. Dont let em bully ya
---
Oh man, I've been trying to figure this out for a while too, thanks
---
T.O.W.N.S. S.H.O.P.S. we need all of these. 
---
If only this hadn‚Äôt been reported for months and not fixed...
---
Thanks! 
---
I‚Äôve been testing it and as long as you aren‚Äôt on a team and you are [HIDDEN], they shouldn‚Äôt be able to see you. Friend of mine plays PVP a lot and he‚Äôs able to sneak around the map. 
---
Maybe it was a Ray Stevens reference by the devs, were you near a church?
---
Any text you want to hide just highlight it with your mouse (drag over the words) then in the icons at the bottom of this text box (assuming you have the default markup active) is an icon to make the text "spoilers".  The icon is a circle with an exclamation mark in it.  Click that button and it will hide the text so that those of us who want to read it can click the obfuscated text and it will appear.  The text is hidden for anyone who doesn't want to read it.
---
I‚Äôve server hoped  but only really for random encounters 
---
Yeah the wording on Dailies is misleading. 
---
The Camden Park on I can always do. But the other ones are seem to be on a different timer. There are some I can‚Äôt do because they‚Äôre labeled daily but not really a daily. 
---
Yup. I had to switch to that too just because we all got swarmed. I mean level 30 in the Nuke zone?  I barely touched it until 60s. 
---
And thank you. 
---
Yes it works for events/vendor inventory/daily quest and mobs but does not work for items as they have a 22-24h cd before you see them again at the same spot.
---
 That's what I did. I now have a set for my alt and one my present char has learned. That's the infamous Hand Made Gun plans I'm talking about.
---
 I farmed the fuck out of Watoga and Harper's Ferry with my level 22 alt and did not get them. I put my present into Watoga at level 13 and at level 15 he got one. He saw 4 more and bought one between 15 and 20. He has not seen one since. He lives 6 caps from Watoga and we know very well indeed. 
---
Random reward from several events, including Census Violence (starts in the bog)
---
i want this more than anything in my life ever 
---
Please just let me break down ammo I don't need to get gunpower/steel/lead, to make the ammo that I do need.
---
I think it's an x box problem... i've never had these kind of issues on ps4
---
It might need to be a 3-star legendary, not just a regular legendary. 
---
It's funny that you keep replying to me, it really shows how butthurt you are, you can't take a joke and roll with it. Grow up bro and learn to take a joke before you further embarrass yourself. 
---
Yeah am moving slow but nearing endgame at 60 as well. The bos questline.. that mine.. woooo that was something. The whole "theres no story" people just have no idea...
---
My next 40 lvls should be interesting 
---
Probably died, mutated, went to a vault or had to struggle to survive. There Probably was several that formed but considering that most fallout game's take place 100+ years after the bombs. Most military factions we're probably lost or exist in areas we haven't gotten to play yet. Never know some thing new might pop up. The brotherhood has just gotten lucky. The techno cult they are demands complete loyalty. thats why they used to not except new recruits. You had to be born and raised to ensure no chance of betrayal.
---
Indeed. Having some sort of shopping center, auction plaza or trade market in the T.O.W.N.S would give players a reason to visit them and to travel to other players towns as well. Trade is the lifeblood of civilizations.
---
I do hope we find her eventually.
---
First rule of any good TV show these days. If you don't see the body , they aint dead. Hopefully this applies to The Overseer. Down the line I would love her to be the first real NPC in future content. 
---
for me ghouls at the golf club have dropped more valuable items without nuke.
---
I agree with you. 
---
But maybe wallace himself has had enough. Every other rando shopper that comes by drags along a trail of ghouls or scorched or super muties. Cant be assed to hand out asswhoopings. 
---
Sacre Bleu!
---
You can fast travel into Nuke zones while in a team or with a friend in the server in the zone. Push and hold pause button, go to friend in Nuke zone and click on fast travel. Profit
---
If its a physical item, it only spawns in world if that player closest loaded it in and didn't take it. If you picked up the plan on the ground and server hop, you're the closest player most of the time probably so it doesn't spawn. Vendors always change inventory though. 
---
Indeed!
---
could be. only thing known about them is that they are a mercenary group.
---
I thought the boomers before I remembered they were vault dwellers that found a military base.
---
Amen!
---
Mole rat landminers. Only seen them once. 
---
He is in the fight club.
---
I will give it a shot, Thanks! 
---
Stable servers
---
Why are you changing servers? 
---
Still, you'd think there would be some mention of them with some of the old info we can find on terminals.
---
Dont log out while overweight, dipstick
---
Someone was using berry mentats!! üòÅ
---
Where do I start I have so many ideas like player run radio stations, the idea that you can build and upgrade your radio and antennas to get greater range, etc. So many things you could do if you did that. 
---
You must not be playing the game.
---
Humor, take lightly. 
---
Are you using PA Targeting HUD? I havent clarified, but i think that may be my problem. Hoping so at least. 
---
Well, not really. If its the case, they need to fix it.
---
someone has used the mentats that light people up
---
I found legendary level 1 beaver week ago. It dropped autostim wood piece. I thought that would be such troll thing to drop on front of Vault 76. Heh heh, it could quickly eat up all the stims some low level player has. So I dropped it where I killed that thing.
---
https://i.imgur.com/F7avIUM.jpg
---
Berry Mentats makes things glow purple. It has a strange effect, like the penetrating HUD mod, where other people can also see it when someone uses it.
---
berry i believe it is
---
50. Cal machine gun clips hold 250... apposed to handmade that can hold 30..
---
Feed me Seymour... feed me all night long...
---
These semantics are getting old. This is not a valid metaphor because people that duped paid for the game and you gain nothing tangible. Stealing from a store isn‚Äôt even in the same ballpark.
---
Here come the downvotes. 
---
Are you just naturally fabulous?
---
Guessing you got kicked too?
---
Yeah I ran into one in a queen nuke zone yesterday. 
---
 Yeah I did a couple that did not count, while a random bot in Watoga gave me one, while ... dealing with Phoenix. ;)
---
He got caught so long on something for me once he committed suicide.  Really, he said that he was giving up and self destructing and he did.
---
Always when you are fighting the queen. 
---
Are you pregnant?
---
Sure I got mine from doing the line in the sand event. I do that event quite often as my C.A.M.P is very close to it. Always gives good loot. At least 2 fusion cores and plenty of BOS rewards.
---
I've been in WS once with 2 nukes and 90% of drops was 2 *
---
I‚Äôve yet to encounter a wild fog crawler in prime fissure site yes scorched variant but never seen a regular one
---
One showed up at my base was a John Carpenters thing moment for me 
---
Don't you have to kill scorchbeasts to get recommendations?
---
I really hate all the perk switching that is required. Fucking annoying. Especially for lockpick and hacking
---
I've been trying to get the grape mentats recipe and the enclave med vendor always has something different when I hop servers.
---
I seen them a lot during breach and clear events
---
Go play FO4 like everyone else sick of 76.
---
I've been in WS once with 2 nukes and most drops we're 2*s 
---
I think it‚Äôs best that you find that kind of game with a game that is traditionally like that. I am as happy as anyone with the new direction 76 has taken. But Fallout will not and should not be a game like that. 
---
Yup that's why my upper level attic is empty! You can still get some rounds through the small cracks which would def piss me off having things get messed up constantly. The front worked out awesome and I have no troubles locking the block in and leaving!
---
That can't be right.  I did a 1 nuke WS tonight and there wasn't a single damned legendary in the 30+ minutes I was there.
---
The one with the rad rats following them I encountered it yesterday then proceed to kill them .-.
---
yes by the fence in whitesprings all the time
---
Same justification criminals use for their wrongdoings. "If they were stupid enough to fall for it, they deserved to get scammed/robbed/stolen from."
---
No, they didn't deserve it.
---
Come on. This game is barely hanging on, stop trying to defend the developers. 
---
Honestly I ended up duping my excavator armor today and have no freakin clue how I did it, and couldn't recreate no matter what I tried. all I remember doing was getting out of my power armor and suddenly being encumbered 
---
Oh The Music Man is on PS4 I heard he cleared a whole server raiding the other night..they say beware when you hear music playing 
---
Wandering is key, the game is constructed from the roots of treasure / secret finding, vast open zen, complicated character building and in world housing (done in very few games but a classic call back to classic sims, the sims, SWG), and the vividness of contemplating death and demise, and reverence for the fallen. Welcome to the herd! The secret of this game's incredible experience is unfolding to you, it rewards you for presence, intenfulness, and perseverance of your character's heart.
---
Oh my gosh üòÇ I don't have the patience to stick around long enough for that lol
---
You mean something interesting? N.O.P.E
---
Use melee weapons with bleed damage. 
---
They could even make it a questline where you recover a broadcast system and then a series of mini quests where you traverse Appalachia searching for various holotapes loaded with music you could play!

I've seen a few in The Mire, but the weirdest was a glowing hermit crab at a WS nuke zone.

She'd been stabbed by a Mole Miner, had no Stimpacks, was actively bleeding to death, and was in a location filled with high-level ghouls. I'm sorry, either she's dead, or Bethesda's pulling more Retcon Brand Magical Bullshit!¬© out of their ass.
---
An albino spawns fairly often at the substation just north of Watoga.
---
There you go again. Just stop. 
---
I said good day.
---
Maybe that's the only time you see them then, since I've done that event once and that's when I saw them. 
---
I would totally do this
---
It has to say legendary in the name, the stars didn't mean legendary when I completed it.

I was rather shocked when he did.  There was still about half of the event time left too.

Scrap weapons you don't want, you'll learn mods.
---
Scrap junk before you stash. Stash before you take on anything likely to kill you.
---
Do the Overseer's quest until you can fully kit out your Camp with the major crafting stations (can't get the PA station until you're 25).
---
Energy weapons are woefully underpowered at present, even heavies, but Bethesda know this and will fix it eventually.
---
PA and weapons are level-locked.  You can't use everything you find right away.  Figure out a percentage of your stash you're willing to devote to aspirational weapons or armor, should you find them.  Stick to that limit.
---
If you absolutely know what weapon type you want to main, use the Nukes and Dragons builder to plan how to max your damage to enemies. It's helpful to understand you won't see certain perk cards until certain levels.
---
&gt;  Just because its really, really, really, against the law doesn't make it immoral.
---
Nothing makes nothing immoral. It's people choosing. This is immoral. This is nothing.
---
That's right.. dispute the charge on your card :)
---
Isn't the behemoth always at the lake?  I've seen the mothman several times and the flatwoods monster maybe 3 times.  I've killed each only one time.  Still looking for that damned alien though....
---
I added you, is it still available?
---
I saw him today and was wondering if anything interesting would happen if I killed the piper and all the rats, but it didn't.  The rats will aggro though if you attack them.
---
The store items are sort of understandable. Though I think they should've been in the game by default.
---
You're out of a vault dedicated to rebuild, the stuff in there is pristine. At least I assume the atom shop items are from there.
---
It's a wonderful direction! I kindly disagree that it shouldn't be like that..it can be so many things, why not? I've played fallout since the first (yes, I'm old) and think such variety would be an awesome, optional, addition to this game. Trust, I get the point of fallout but there is a miriad of in game possibilities that would add some wonderful variety to the game, imo. 
---
Tetanus?
---
That's odd I was in one last night and got like 6 in 10 mins but all 1*s 
---
I think comparing weight to actual weight probably isn‚Äôt an effective critique. The point seems to be balancing and prioritizing what you lug around, not being scientifically accurate as to what a missile would weigh versus a Stimpak. 
---
Oh look babe, Rammestein live at grafton steel!!

Looks like robots don't believe in vaccinations either

That's only at the vendor.  I got mine in my 80s from the Patrol Duty event.

Thank you!
---
It may not be Bethesda's fault each individual asshole duped, but the overall negative effect of duping and other bugs on the games economy is definitely Bethesda's fault, they are the only ones who can secure their game, nobody else.

dont waste your time with pipe weapons, i accidentally picked a few perks for my pipe guns at low level and regreted it when i found hunting rifles and pump actions are much more common

What if it's the only gun i have? Got no weight for more, so what do I do?
---
Exist
---
Boo hoo waah waah somebody else killed MY legendary
---
It's supposed to, lore wise. 
---
The game kind of struggles from an identity crisis. It wants you to take time and attention to explore and read notes/terminals to uncover a lot of story. And you should, The world they have built is really cool. But the game also wants you to grind hard for loot and crafting junk. Which makes you want to rush around just killing and looting as fast as you can. It‚Äôs hard to remember to slow down and take in the world sometime, but it‚Äôs a huge part of the long term enjoyment of the game. 
---
Better yet, drop the TO along with the iou note for TP.
---
I was in the middle of reading this and it was removed:(
---
All cheaters try to defend themselves with a rationale against the argument nobody made, that they dont have a reason.  We know they made up a reason.  We dont care what that reason is.   You're still a cheater and you're a cheater because you're a shit person.   Full stop.
---
Lol I experienced liberators also one time it was glowing ghouls during a nuke but every legendary we killed would self destruct like a legendary protectron lol it was pretty funny died a couple times to it
---
PS4.  It wasn't just me either, I had a couple guys run past me with mikes and ask if I'd seen any.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs only ruining the game for others if I‚Äôm giving duped items to griefers who are running around being douchebags? Otherwise how does someone‚Äôs gear ruin the game for other players? What if I told you I know the people aren‚Äôt griefing others with the items I give them?
---
You may want to list your system when asking for help
---
I believe that there is, but I am not well-versed enough with the data values to understand which ones decided the drop chance. 
---
I wanna resonate with your point of view on duping but with this comment it kinda just killed it for me..you spoke of all that and then just say oh well? You may as well not even exploit and let it be if all you‚Äôre gonna come to is an oh well and a freakin shrug. Lol 
---
It is getting late, maybe just call it an early night and try again tomorrow, not all days can be bad right?
---
Wtf you wasting all that time for armors plans for. Grind legendary armor drops. If you rocking crafted armor then /slitwrists 
---
I can't speak to how Bethesda is doing it, but it isn't out of the question. Even if the developer does everything by the book, the server OS's can sometimes do wonky stuff; which can be super difficult to debug since there's nothing technically wrong with your code (so even asking for help just winds up with people saying to do what you're already doing because it *should* work).
---
Heck, could even be an AWS issue and Bethesda is just the first company running servers with them in this particular way. 
---
Kind of depends on your build. Power armor using two handed weapon, you can start at level 15.
---
Yes, the stocked candy cane looking walking sticks, croquet mallets and princess beds because they were fundamental for the rebuilding of the world.

Does anyone else feel sorry for the voice actors who did the Scorched? Their throats must have gotten sore. The woman who did the female ones is great. I wonder if it's the same as my favourite female Raider voice in FO4.  It was great to hear Ron Perlmann at the beginning. He sounded a lot more civilised than he is on Twitter.
---
You can enter whenever since the age no enemies there. But i'd do the  unruly golfers quest then return at like lvl 50, or if you see a nuke. A lot of high lvl players go there so you'll probably be seeing lvl65 gouls there. 
---
oh yuh brother üòéüòéüòé
---
&gt; Everyone and there mother is figuring out you can stack bobbleheads and kill people through pacifist mode
---
This is 100% false. Stop spreading fake news.
---
Part of the trick is to keep scrapping everything you find, learn new plans and mods, make new weapons and armor every 5/10 levels or so...  Also be selective about what you keep and what you sell/scrap.  But a lot depends on playstyle, what do you generally like doing?
---
Explosive damage lol but as a hidden item like a land mine that goes off when picked up. I know where I'd be dropping lots of them
---
Vault-tec has always been rather silly and really scary.
---
That would mean I‚Äôd have to trust someone who intentionally lags and or completely break servers by duping for his own selfish reasons which I don‚Äôt think is gonna happen. So you keep destroying servers I‚Äôll enjoy when people like you all get banned so the rest of us don‚Äôt have to lag constantly for your pleasure.
---
The downvotes you're getting suggest that maybe you should grief. Telling people you don't is making them mad.

End Game Content

Had that problem today. I was trying to help a friend launch a nuke, with two other friends were at my camp gearing up for SBQ when another guy showed up. One friend accidentally shot the stranger. So said stranger wiped out both buddies and my ENTIRE camp. I ditched my buddy in the silo to go to my camp. Anything that could destry, he did. When I asked him why, he was all bent because he got "griefed" by a level 29. He was 80-some and clearly running with a TSE.
---
A lot of the dupes utilize server instability though, like dropping a bunch of items to lag the server etc. Some are so bad they cause minor server rollbacks. I've logged in once or twice after my lag was getting a little hairy, and came back three quests behind where I was. 
---
For one, the engine would be awful for a shooting based game. It‚Äôs been awful in every game but we put up with it because there is so much else being offered. And I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the direction they want to go currently. Fallout 76 started as a game to answer the question of what it would be like to play fallout 4 with friends. I think that means it remains a large world to explore with a group of friends. Within that goal, you are right, they can do so much still. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they added some pvp events. But I don‚Äôt expect to see any separate game modes. 
---
I was big into making runs and base building in 4
---
Strange
---
I'm on x1 and like I said last night was acting like normal
---
I've seen other double comments in this comment section. Don't know whats going on
---
Snipers use suppressors. 
---
Same here, it's gotten to the point I just stopped playing. I finally got to a semi decent level and now I'm kicked from the server, game crashes or double loading screens. It's hard to defend a game when you cant play it. Dont get me wrong I love the game but its just irratating. I didn't even have these issues during the beta.
---
A green Protectron actually, I've only seen a few.
---
I disagree with the feature howerver im ok with it. Im not ok with all my food going away at 1 time
---
I try to sell 1400 caps worth of stuff all at once and the route I take, to save on jump costs, is: 
---
Watoga train station then to Super Duper Mart
---
jump to Harper's Ferry and sell there
---
jump to WS and go inside the resort then out and in to the Enclave bunker
---
jump to Vault 76 for the free jump then jump to Sutton Station to sell to the Raider vendor
---
then jump to Flatwoods to sell to the Responder's vendor.
---
I think that you should research opportunity cost. 
---
While dupers are obviously wrong and no one should ever dupe items in multiplayer game, your statement is a little dangerous in terms that it excuses Bethesda's sloppiness. I mean, yeah, it's Bethesda's fault too.
---
I'll admit, as much as I hate all the cheating? I 100% used the fusion core glitch. I don't play enough to merit hunting more cores down. Real life gets in the way. Kept 10 cores always maxed so I was ready when it got fixed even. Lol.
---
Don't get attached to any items, you won't have much room to store things in this game sadly, most of your home base storage will be used up by crafting materials and unused food, drinks, supplies, etc. 
---
better yet find the hand full of ass holes doing it and remove them from the servers permanently. dont ruin my game and thousands of others for a few bad eggs.
---
I've heard a lot of stories about this happening, seems like the fallout community is a good one 
---
PS4
---
it wont give me about 6 location discoveries. i revisit them, but nope, wont tic off on the challenge list.
---
I entered it at 20 and I‚Äôve regretted it ever since because all I did was hangout there and was scared to leave. That‚Äôs just me personally. 
---
Nice
---
They just need to correctly add the legendary AP points missing from said items to resolve the problem, Legendary Syringers and drills could be great, 3* wood armor could be good for sneaky sneaky builds, Bethesda just needs to fix the errors in the game files 
---
If ammo is an issue, then go melee for a week or so.it should build up a good store of ammo for you. Put some perk points towards being able to manufacture your own ammo at tinker's benches. Doing loot runs simply for components is also something I'd suggest. 
---
I was reading the lore from Fallout 1 the other day and the amount of retconning isn't as bad as people make it seem. I'd agree it's a stretch at times, but some of the changes can work. 
---
Like the Super Mutants. FEV was created before the bombs were dropped. So it could've been acquired or passed to other facilities or companies pre-bombing.
---
BoS as we know are the US military. They obviously existed before the bombings. So what do stranded troops do in a situation like the one they're in? Militia up and try to contact command. Obviously they got through and joined the BoS. The satellite part is a Bethesda add-in though. Satellites only seem to appear from Fallout 3 onward.
---
Enclave can easily exist anywhere, as they were the US Government, but they should be a rarity.
---
Deathclaws are a stretch, but Bethesda could've fixed this one up by having a creation facility for them in Virginia. Because the US did have Deathclaws prior to the bombings. It's just odd there are so many in Virginia, so soon after the bombs fell.
---
On FoNV it was so easy to get caps all you needed was 10 luck and the ability to play blackjack in casinos and you could make plenty of money, until of course they kicked you out. 
---
Xbox
---
Should just do it survival mode style where it continually damaged you,  periodic  leg damage,  and penalties to  endurance and agility.
---
Yeah thats why I was taken aback when it had no function after having the explanation right there. We get her gun and garb but not the veil
---
You can find those around the excelsior house. It'll either be fog crawlers, anglers, or gulpers

Edited: xbox

Liars dice.

If I need to Farm Gears and Screws I go into Sanjay's repair shop in Morgantown (Where you begin the Back on the Beat event), there you can usually get about a dozen each from the loose packages on the shelves and tool boxes.
---
There are three ways to get commendations and that's one of them.  The other two are to kill legendaries and do enclave events.
---
Thank you I‚Äôll take a look later when I can!
---
What perk cards help with ammo?
---
I use it to weaken enemies or apply a DoT while doing damage with my main weapon. I would've added some mod that allows you to heal or buff other players.
---
If you already opened the safe the key goes to, why do you need the key?
---
&gt;That's easily refuted
---
It's not easily refunded though ;)
---
I've found t-51 PA at the Grafton dam twice for sure.  Haven't been there for awhile though.  I'm missing one lousy left arm to complete my set.
---
yep. were you gonna buy anything else?
---
How is this fake news? I run a 30 player community and around 8 people have had their power armors 1 shot by bobblehead exploiters which btw completely breaks your power armor and kills you through pacifist mode. 
---
Dachshunds in the wasteland have mutated oddly, I see.
---
Awesome! It looks like a beautiful game
---
My 308 is my primary....  I got 13 rounds.
---
Is there a headgear that goes with the officer suit?
---
**You're asking for more microtransactions?** Really? In a game you already paid for?
---
This stuff should just be in the game. Most of these ideas were free in fo4.
---
People like you are what's wrong with the industry nowadays.
---
It only flags you if your inventory doubles I believe 
---
No
---
And if that were possible in 76 caps would be completely worthless to everyone. In 4 once I hit 10000 I never truly spent caps after that, I made rounds and made profits beyond everything I was buying. It's the same thing as the government printing more money to make up for a deficit. It's not like it's hard to raise caps. 1400 a day you'll hit cap limit in less than 3 weeks if you don't spend them.
---
Are there any quest lines there at all?
---
Yes, imo
---
Bird bones. That's all 
---
Lore wise, there's only one geck in a vault.
---
The legendary long dog!
---
Great music, your pvp build is gonna be useless though with that upcoming nerf to two shot and explosive; can't wait for the b.s to get balanced out.
---
Try adding another set of stairs somewhere else, then removing the stairs you want. Maybe that'll work? 
---
Animal Friend rank 3 if you're lazy
---
Nice post. I come from vault 13, not bethesda era, I love this game as dearly as every favorite rare game that has managed to get my attention since the formative moments I spent in the junktown fallout demo and then the full games.
---
Most every issue you described I largely covered in my response to the call for feedback they put out on jan 1 inside the vault. If you want to check it out my /u is always open.
---
most of the issue will be fixed by what amount to very minor changes, not large reimaginings / reworks. This is simple idea efficiency- they can solve almost every frustration by streamlining the broken UIs, which in some cases involves implementing buildable and portable containers of various types for either item display, or utility whether that is organization/storage enhancement or refrigeration or Transactional (example - I hide a cache of supplies in a player camp to thank them for leaving it open for use, this replaces mailing them something that might have happened in a less wasteland like setting). The fallout 1 barter UI would be perfect, I was totally baffled the first time I tried to trade since the example of how it could be done even with extensive inventories from either side was there from the beginning. Now we are all dealing with the broken drop bag or using in world containers, when player choice driven item supply / exchange / treasure caching could be much more with very simple container mechanics being added to finish the vanilla/alpha idea of the paper bag.
---
I do feel that wacky off the wall capabilities fits the oldschool aesthetic the game has always cherished. I never played bethesda's games, couldn't get into any elder scrolls games, but mutation has always been in the game and the modern take on it alongside the PERK system is one of my favorite things.
---
I think it will be perfect once we can upgrade cards and receive the higher rank while retaining the lower one, gain the ability to store cards we won't be using for equip, and having magazines and bobble heads become limited equippable items into the build - once equipped we access it on long cooldown, for either 1-2 hour buff or a clutch 30 second type special ability, so that it is no longer a broken stackable and so that players can gather tham all and aggregate the benefit as well as possibly level it up to the highest available strength as a reward for the exploration gameplay.
---
I tried once, but all it said was "You can't go that way"
---
I wish there were arm mods that weren't just melee focused. 
---
I get that sometimes way after everything loads. I thought crouching might make that freezing too, I ofter crouch when the game initially loads, so that it's safe to wait everything to load before continuing.
---
You craft it from plans in an overseers cache.. I think in grafton
---
Same I‚Äôd love carry weight, maybe vats accuracy and harvest bonuses 
---
I once waited like 4-5 mins and my char was still frozen. I could see the game was running fine.
---
Have you been eating the pink paste at the Suffolk County Charter School?
---
For farming legendaries I think each player is different. Some people swear by Whitesprings but I have never had good luck there, at least for 3* items. Pretty much have to find your own honey hole or route and just do it. 
---
Tell me you have a Vendor Bot chorale on backing vocals!
---
I wrote "property of *name*" out front for this exact purpose.
---
how does that stop it?  people still weight glitching. then use alt to store dupes. slow it but not stop. better solution, fix it correctly and directly. indirect isn't the answer.
---
I have it, on pc what do you have
---
East ... Since the legendary spawns are static per server, your best tactic is to look for them in the usual spots : super mutant settlements, the Watoga bots, Harper's Ferry ... Once you've noted a few good places, go back again so you get a new spawn. Just today I came back 3 times to the farm just south of watoga where I found 3 level 50 mirelurks each time.
---
I just cleared glassed cavern and the stories that lead me there. 
---
I too stood atop the pile.. next to my brothers.. unleashing grenades and gunfire... it was something. 
---
All the haters that said theres no story... never made it this far.. never heard... never listened to the holo tapes.. the pain.. sadness.. the despair. 
---
There is story. And it is done well. Patience. Is the key. Not racing to the end game.. 
---
I crouch almost every time I load in to be safe. I've never had an issue with that causing a freeze, but it could be hardware specific. 
---
I got "Disconnected From Server"
---
Alright, thanks. I've encountered someone in it before but I don't think I have the plans. I'll check out Grafton. 
---
Sadly, you are correct.  Crafted stuff is basically pointless.  Hope they fix that someday
---
I'm lost.
---
Watching people load in and die instant during nukes at whitesprings is one of the funniest things to witness in the entire game. 
---
45 is max level.
---
Be me.
---
Spawn in nuke zone.
---
Die with last nights loot.
---
Can‚Äôt respawn as overweight in any area other than nuke zone.
---
Can‚Äôt spawn, can‚Äôt grab loot.
---
I've been disconnected from my other vault mates ever since I left the vault, when I do see anyone I view it as a chance encounter for my character and play it by ear as you would a stranger in the wastes. If they're dumb enough to try and attack, I get free scrap. If not just a wave and ignored; if we're not actively doing the same quest. 
---
ok ur gt?

What time does Brahmin Decapitation hit the stage?

It all averages out statistically. No one person can affect the system.

Bethesda announced a $276 Jacket, it seems to be having (as usual) a lot of backlash.
---
For ages I thought it was a glitch!
---
fyi, when the narrator lady on comm's says there is terminated maintenance, thats when the legendary spawns. 
---
And they're EXPENSIVE!!
---
I saw one today too! 
---
How do fix that? Crafted armor is best in game? Then you need to find plans to make ‚Äúbest armor‚Äù in game hence you need to grind plans. Same thing as grinding armor drops imo.  So also imo nothing needs to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù here.  This is the way it is. This game has much more pressing problems than this topic. 
---
Reminds me of why i killed three-dog
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt trying to be an ackshually guy, but I just feel like people are jumping too quick on the Bethesda is ruining lore train these days... which don‚Äôt get me wrong they definitely do just not in this particular instance 
---
Lmao thanks. I gotta look this up. People get so mad over trivial things lol.
---
So you're saying it shows for TSE Handmade because that's a ballistic explosive?
---
That's right. I never touched the hand pumps after I got the clean water pumps
---
with 5 levels of guerrilla and bloody mess i get 50 damage but i don't use them cards there are better ways to spend agility cards.
---
Also, we need more good grind events. Every map I load in and 2/3 of the server is grinding whitesprings and uranium fever. Seems like every time I try and do uranium fever now it‚Äôs with like 4 or 5 other people. If you‚Äôre doing these events please let everyone get a hit in on the baddies so we can all get the loot/xp!
---
    The Overseer lady said more people would be coming by...
---
\[squirrel\]Well, I guess you're wondering, did I fire twelve shots, or only eleven. Well, to tell you the truth, in all the excitment, I've lost track myself. So, the question you have to ask yourself....
---
BANG
---
Shit.
---
I was going to say makeshift warrior, but I see it's only for making weapons. Whoops, however scrounger does give a small chance of more ammo in ammo boxes
---
I think having it as part of your camp would be great, a radio station that is placed like your crafting tables.  It can be damaged, and you have to have a transmitter, but it can be upgraded to have greater range as you get better materials and plans.  Raids could damage and take out your station and whatnot, a scorchbeast nailing your dish for transmitting too much or something would be neat to see implemented too.  
---
About a week or two ago I spent about 5-8 hours a day for two days trying for the X-01 calibrated shocks. Nothing. Then the past two days I played normally and would just check randomly after a disconnect or crash and got two shocks. RNG is RNG. 
---
Because I probably have something crazy going on in my noggin and knowing there's a key I've missed but should be able to get nearly causes me pain.
---
Ammosmith (level 34) &amp; Super Duper (level 50), so both out of your reach at the moment.
---
Main thing with ammo is to avoid fighting higher-level enemies until you can kill them cheaply. They chew through your ammo and don't drop any more than lower levels do. Otherwise, use as many different types of ammo as possible, and use stealth where you can. Stealth also preserves your armor.
---
I just want a mechanical bull to put on top of my house and put floodlights on while we all drink and use chems.
---
Oh Jesus shut up. 
---
Added on xbox, I only use a few guns so am usually dumping ammo. If I see you on F76 I'll make a point of contacting
---
I don't really care since I don't play the game anymore, but seeing that kinda made me laugh at how poorly made it was
---
Tbh I think it would be fine if they weren‚Äôt causing massive server lag/kicks as well as one shorting players with overpowered weapons. I used to do it all the time in all of Bethesda‚Äôs other games. 
---
But this, is just a whole different level. Dupers are literally ruining the game. Bethesda needs to send out more bans and get the private servers (or a PVE mode) out already.
---
Old timer here, played **Fallout** on PC in '96 and played... **Wastelend** in college.  
---
I've played them all.  I don't need to play them again.  I can always just load'em up on PC or PS3/4.  This one is Fallout at the core and a new way to play.  
---
I love it.  I'm sorry you don't.

Old timer here, played Fallout on PC in '96 and played... Wasteland in college.

Hah, lol, I love how well it fits. Yeah I don't care what they are we definetely need T.OW.N.S

Why would a duper want caps?

I chucked an orbital strike beacon into a guys base tonight cause he was farming the Whitesprings golf resort with his turrets. First time I've ever destroyed someone's base and I kind of feel bad about it?

Doesn't look that bad to me. I would rock it, especially since no one else would have it.
---
You can get in there early as long as you sneak and don't try to fight anything. Good way to get 200 extra vendor caps a day at least.
---
There's two different answers to your question ‚Äî one for when there's a Blast Zone, and the other for all the rest of the time.
---
When it's in a Blast Zone (or its immediate aftermath), the glowing beasties that want to eat you are much faster and stronger, and they hunt in packs, and they can overwhelm the Whitespring guard robots. 
---
But you can comfortably visit the shops and use the workbenches pretty much as soon as you can make your way there ‚Äî level 6 is maybe still a bit low for that, but level 12 or 15 isn't ‚Äîand, having once discovered it, you can fast-travel back for those (again, when it's not in a Blast Zone).
---
For farming when it's not in a Blast Zone, in a group you can do that in the low 30s certainly. Solo, maybe 40 or 50ish.
---
This post.  Great post.
---
Same. Destroyed my buildings with TSE weapons. I'm just glad that they didn't kill me. I carry thousands of bulk junk. It's not that it's hard to repair. It's just an annoyance.

To me it looks really wrinkly :/

Do they have a making of video?

This is as close as I could find. I don't think that's trivial. I think everyone should be mad.

That's true. Is real leather not supposed to? I honestly never really have bought leather clothing, so I would not know.
---
Wtf
---
the way they turn from 'lesser known' to 'well known barren' is from posts like these :)   
---
My lips are sealed.
---
You can respawn at the vault if you are overencumbered. Rookie
---
No, it's not
---
I had a friend like that, the smallest inconvenience would piss him off or he didn't get something he wanted and he'd get mad and start talking shit on the game. He ended up playing another game and 76 messed up for him somehow and he got even more upset and quit the game entirely. Haven't played with him since.
---
Game of thrones 76 style.
---
These dupers bought the game in the first place, they have every right, you dont buy a chance to steal unsecured goods from a shop you just do it, its bethesdas fault for being incompetent, we bought the game and everything it entails, hate the game not the player
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Damn, Bethesda.....This is why you never conform to what "the fans want". Starting from "we want multiplayer".
---
If you guys do save enough and buy a ps4 with 76 trust me it'll be worth it being able to play side by side with each other.
---
There can be human companions, even if it‚Äôs just for an event or two at a time. YMMV
---
Did you read it three times?
---
Because armor is a thing too? Is this a serious question??
---
If you'd like I can come join you
---
Doesn't by when?
---
Always on the road in the mire. 1 regularly spawns just North of Abbie bunker.
---
&gt;Have you been to the SBQ lately?
---
I'm talking about something much bigger.
---
Tonight we dropped a nuke on white springs golf course.  The ghouls at the club simply didn't spawn.  I thought maybe someone had just beaten us to it and killed them fast,  but if that were the case there would be A LOT of meat piles and there weren't any. 
---
The one legendary drop I did get at white springs tonight was a level 35 plasma gun.  In the past I have never seen a weapon drop at such a low level in a nuke zone. 
---
Before you start talking about how the level of players influence  the level of drops, I'm telling you  with certainty that there was not one player there under  level 50. 
---
Early on, it was just understood that nuke zones were for high level players and so high level loot spawned there. 
---
Not now. 
---
Not accurate at all.  I've jsut played the game, and I have never struggled.
---
The only problem is they are guys with 300 TSE handmades and dont mind the risk of losing one.
---
What the fuck?! You fuckin peta, vegan, no gender identifying p.o.s no one wants to see that!
---
I agree. Everyone is going to be so mad in March when we show up with our well thought out pvp toons while they squandered their time.
---
Level 70-something. Saw a Flatwoods monster in the BETA (hell maybe the stress test); no sloths or gulpers yet. No behemoths yet. It's possible I was in the same vicinity as all these critters in a Fissure Prime nuke zone but I was focused on Her Royal Highness.
---
I'm of the opinion that any area with super mutants ought to get behemoths and suiciders after it's nuked.
---
Yeah goodluck let me know if you find it i hope my information is correct
---
Yesterday I was actually amazed by how well things were running on PS4. This morning it was a little off but I was farming nuke plants around the Whitespring so kind of expected. Currently been trying for 30 min just to get reconnected and jumped on here to see if other PS4 players were also whining like me.
---
That‚Äôs a good query, how about you decide? I‚Äôm being completely serious so take that into consideration before you say some shit like ‚Äúan hour‚Äù
---
Yeah, no one wants to see the pain and suffering they inflict on sentient gentle beings when they buy products made with their body parts.
---
After you, or another player on the map(!), nukes a non-fissure-site then enable that quest in your quest log. You'll find another record, recorded AFTER the launch of the nuke. She's alive.
---
My next mission in the main story has been, for a while now, to gather what I need to launch a nuke. I'll get around to it eventually. A week ago I noticed by accident that my overseer quest was suddenly pointing to the shack at Site Alpha, where I found that holotape. I read up on the wiki, and they said it would spawn at Site Charlie whenever someone launches a nuke on the map. But I guess it spawns at whatever site the nuke is launched from?
---
Sounds like cheap leather at that price.
---
Not sure what ppl would expect.
---
Always log out in PA
---
What in the world guy??? Where did I say player levels affects drops as you described with your lengthy rant?
---
Please quote that out.
---
Also LTR, it is very rude to throw paragraphs on someone when you clearly did not understand the original concept of what was being said.
---
Whatever change they make, I think they should solve a more general problem - what to do with legendary drops that you don't need.
---
Think about it - the better your gear, the more drops you don't need which may as well be wood armor. So really, we just need some way to scrap legendaries into legendary materials used to craft legendary properties or other similar gameplay system to redeem currently "useless" legendary drops.
---
U.G.L.Y
---
I didn‚Äôt have anymore, but my friend did..I got it from him..but I don‚Äôt have cap space right now
---
You mention a Satellite dish tower. This could really be used to add a map marker for your camp. So if you have a powered satellite dish tower, anyone can see your camp on their map.
---
Why grind mole miners?  Black Titanium?  Use the Gorge Workshop.
---
Err, you need the BoS plans to make legendary combat armor good. It doesn't tend to drop as BoS.
---
If you're on PC I have a spare BoS chest plan.
---
Lots of people dress that way...
---
Oh alright, thanks anyways
---
I found one, somewhere.  VTU maybe?
---
I feel bad for any poor sap accidentally duping, ngl
---
I support the display armor, gun, and trophy cabinet great idea. All of it added would be even better. 
---
Can we please have the ability to access our Pip Boy while sitting down? 
---
Maybe even an animation for smoking and/or drinking while seated would be cool too.
---
Just like it's my fault that guys stare when I wear a short dress?
---
Or, we could just quit complaining about FO76 being bad. At this point, the wife has been beat mentally and physically. Didn't even take her out to dinner yet..
---
WTF do you expext from r/Stockholm 
---
I just wanted to say thank you, that was very well laid out, and I enjoyed learning about this
---
Someone doesn't like it when people step in front of their tse shotgun when they're being a kill hogging dick, eh?
---
Stagger them with enforce or a buzzy blade.
---
Take over a workshop for a day.  It helps early in the game.  Claim it, set up the resources, and check back in every once in a while to collect.
---
Melee weapons for low level kills.
---
Scrap everything.
---
Start selling to vendors.
---
If you see someone doing a power plant quest, join.  Even if you can't help much, you get great generator/windmill plans.
---
Grab a power armor frame by taking the high level pieces off.  Then once you own it you can put the high level pieces back on, wait for it to auto collect and you can store it in your stash for later, only 10 lbs instead of the loose pieces weight.
---
Flatwoods monster, there is a Cthulu like creature, there are Zethan Aliens too
---
This. Just built mine, and I had it for a total of 90 minutes before some griefer broke it. Now it lives in storage when I'm not at home ‚Äî *and will until they fix things so griefers stop ruining this damned game by blowing up the camps of people like me who have pacifist mode enabled and hate PvP*. But I was able to server-hop, and there were enough other folks nuking either Whitesprings or the SBQ that I was able to get the fluxes I needed for the repairs. 
---
That was known at launch.
---
Trophies weren't retroactive
---
You sir, sure know how to waste moneh
---
It‚Äôd be nice to have a Grand Exchange as well..
---
100% with you OP. The fact they even take the time to figure out how to cheat is pathetic. 
---
Another disgruntled retro fallout fan.  Can we post another one of these?
---
Same here, had to reboot, stuck on loading screen forever
---
I dont have a tse shotgun and have never had the pleasure of another player stepping in front of my shots. Actually wait I have had that happen, but they all died and gave me plenty of caps :*
---
I absolutely agree. Full on loot. I also want the stakes raised even more where any stash box built at *your CAMP* is accessable to *anyone*. 
---
Unequip weapon. Fists can tag.
---
Are you talking about them actually asking money for it? If so, 90% is just basic stuff, that should be in the game already. (and was in FO4)
---
DO NOT PAY THEM MONEY TO PUT BASIC FEATURES IN! Do not reward their behavior. 
---
For whatever reason, I have enough springs and gears to swim through them like Scrooge McDuck through his pool of coins. But screws are harder to come by and I don‚Äôt restock those nearly as fast. Guess I don‚Äôt come across as many toy trucks, fans, etc as I do battered clipboards
---
I agree this is really irritating but I don't get the comments about services and micro transactions.  You don't have to pay for anything. 
---
Why not nuke whitesprings, sell the loot, buy the mod from another player?
---
I mean... do you also grow your own wheat irl so u can eat bread?
---
I'll do you one better, just hold the pit away weapon. Ten times easier to time. And ad you fall you can just pull it out. 
---
Waste is subjective.
---
My boots will last me 5-10 years with proper care.  
---
Cheap leather doesn't last at all and I'd spend more over the years buying new boots.

---
When the last person has mentioned Fallout 76 for the last time.
---
I have to just leave a server and come back, it happens a lot because I do a bit of server hopping.
---
&gt; As someone who plays alone for the most part ... 
---
Given this: 
---
If you haven't played either yet, I strongly, strongly recommend playing through Fallout 4 first.
---
Fallout 4 has a large multiple of the content that they've put into Fallout 76, and in reality, Fallout 76 is still in beta testing, despite the fact that they released it and are selling it: They've lurged from disabling bug to catastrophic imbalance to PR disaster, but eventually Fallout 76 will be more fun than it is now. 
---
And you'll enjoy Fallout 76 more for having learned a lot of game lore and tactics that do indeed translate pretty straightforwardly to the multiplayer game.
---
How much are you willing to pay a month for a private server?  I see all these requests but no mentioning what they would pay.
---
Looks great!! I would go for a roof with peaks though to tie it together though.üëç
---
The T.O.W.N.S could even be on small instances outside the standard Appalachia, just like most DLCs have been for Fallout 3 &amp; 4, the players travel to a nearby city ruin outside the standard Appalachia map, and there find and clear out the city ruin as a raid size (8+ players) Quest to make the T.O.W.N.S project available. There could be a few different cities to choose from depending on what kind of style of project one want (raiders, fort, community, tradepost etc).
---
Can't wait until the H.O.A. gets involved &lt;/s&gt;
---
I‚Äôm level 102 and have been playing since BETA.  I have scoured the regions looking for every location, quest, event, note, etc.
---
Yesterday was only the third time I‚Äôve encountered a griefer.  Was cooking in CAMP when I heard a Tse mini gun tearing things up around me so I logged off.  Came back to a whopping 2 destroyed walls and one turret.  Repaired all and continued my cooking.
---
No, your overly verbose explanation lacks considerable logic regardless of your ‚Äúmasters degree‚Äù
---
Calling people assholes because of a video game is trademark to a petty whiny child. PvP is part of the game. Don‚Äôt like it? Go play hello kitty
---
thief‚Äôs fault he got caught
---
Not my fault some take games like it‚Äôs actual material property they own.
---
Exactly, OP is here being entitled AF and calling people griefers for playing the game
---
How much do these things cost? I have no knowledge on them. 
---
It's as bad and outdated as the 8-Ball jacket from Seinfeld(and real life). 
---
Might be socially acceptable at gaming conventions, just like how a hipster Atari jacket might pass.
---
Outside though? Yeah, not really. My Fallout wallet only goes so far.

---
Clipboards are all over. People mention sugar grove, but I find it picked clean fairly often. But tons of them in many buildings. I‚Äôd rather go on a travel loop probably cling them instead of server hopping. And with the server hop-nerfing, it might be the best way now
---
Lol right because that's how slap damage works üòÇ
---
Did you find me yet ?
---
So basically what you're saying is that ES6 is going to be a microtransaction-fueled, buggy, unfinished game that shits on its previous titles to the point that it divides the entire fanbse? Oof.
---
I wouldn't worry about it until 1.) You're out of quests and high lvl and 2.) They balance legendaries. Each day I log in and farm around 20-50 legendaries at least and vendor 99% because they are all trash.
---
Hope so, its so dull. 
---
DONT COPY THAT FLOPPY
---
Share us some details, I am gathering player opinions to help communicate the types of feedback and ways that different players could want similar fixes or things that are only important to certain player segments
---
meta endgamers vs casual/RP adventurer players, either one could be considered valid forms of game enjoyment. griefers exist in the first group
---
It's the first hit
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on this because I may be wrong. But I read somewhere that the commonwealth is actually full of green pants and trees, it‚Äôs just that the game is set during the end of fall/beginning of winter so all the trees leaves had fell. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many leaves on the ground in the game

Thanks!   I will keep a lookout for him in the future, was just surprised since I never heard the name before and he was talking to me!

I farm springs from a few different areas. Firstly is mountainside bed and breakfast and the 2-3 Yao Guai there, next is from Sugar Grove and taking all of the pens and clipboards there. Finally, i can usually make a lot by simply exploring some and getting it that way.
---
Imagine if it were made of dog skin? The outrage! If people could see those animals as they see their pet dogs, and imagine how their pet dog would feel in that situation, a lot more people would be vegan. But there is a disconnect. A wilful ignorance. A cultural and societal conditioning from birth. One animal is an object to be thrown around and killed for food and clothes. Another shares our homes and gets our love and affection. It's completely unnecessary when there are alternatives for everything made with animal products. So it's a choice. And a choice that not only affects the lives of those innocent animals, but also the environment and our own health is negatively impacted by those choices.
---
Yeah. It and was fucking stupid and everyone made fun of it
---
Double barrel can get to 50 accuracy if you get skeetshooter. Without that perk, is 35. I've only seen a pump at 15.
---
how the fuck can a condescending remark be 'generic' ?
---
Yeah I'm not getting the downvotes here. Three cheers for mutual coincidence of wants. It's why finding people and player to player trading are specifically supported in the game.
---
I am a ballistic heavy PA build. A buddy is a VATS-crit, bloodied, fast knife build.  I give him bladed legendaries I find, and he does the same for buffed firearms for me. This is neither unforeseeable nor unacceptable.
---
So turn this game into rust?
---
Use the perk that allows you to pick two plants at once.
---
Anecdotal evidence?
---
same
---
Chem effects would be for the syringer, not the crossbow. Crossbow would be different damage types (fire, ice, electric, etc), explosive, or like someone else said, VATS targeting beacon.
---
Yeah, specifcally anything I buy from the atom shop or anything that is outside my camp gets messed up. 
---
Hopefully Bethesda realizes what we all already knew. We want more Fallout and the ability to play fallout with our friends. Let's be real...they do what they do best. Fallout. Plain and simple. Expecting to get good MMO or PVP out of them isn't going to work.
---
Did I say it was because of slap damage? Why do you assume that? Has someone been bullying you? Awww I'm so sowwy, daddy peanut will comfort you

My pump is at something around that and it has way better range 
---
Haha yes yes, and us wolves need sheep to eat, so I'm not even upset.
---
&gt;Where did I say player levels affects drops as you described with your lengthy rant?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Please quote that out.
---
You never said that and I didn't claim that you did.  But that is the usual response I get when I point out that low level loot is getting dropped in high level areas. 
---
Back to your original question  about the queen, she has been dropping crap lately.  Both me and my team mates have experienced this.     I have nine luck, some of them have luck equal to yours and our experiences have been the same. 
---
You have issues and should seek professional help... 
---
They never go too deep into the gunners. They just say their well organized mercs. They could have started from ex-millitary. It would explain why they wear millitary uniforms. They also have knowledge pre-war tech like lazer and plas weapons,  robots, and vertibirds. You don't see many merc groups get as large as them and stay organized. They could be a good canidate.
---
Obtained from the developer room don‚Äôt buy one
---
IME they have a lot of trouble landing in some terrain. Rocky hills are bad, and so is most of the Mire for some reason. Even if you're sitting in the middle of that highway, they often won't land.
---
I don't play melee, but if I did, I'd be strongly inclined to chuck on the Stealth perk and walk away.
---
More like 150 - 200+ . I'm almost to 70 and still have a ton of missions to do. I'm assuming a lot of people grinded like I did at White springs. 
---
so the game isnt rewarding you spending hours farming one activity?
---
i want to understand what is the mechanic fix or ideal we should find / propose
---
Grog axe can't be repaired beyond 100%. Weapons at 200% will do 30% more damage. Drop the grog and get a pole hook my dude.
---
That and unyielding/radicool/nerdrage
---
 Mine is a hand me down but is a nice one and it retailed for around $600. I bought my daughter one from a fairly famous local crafter and paid $350 and got a smoking deal.

 Go back to your hoodies kids. ;)

Hahaha nothing like a good troll spewing utter nonsense to get me a good laugh 
---
That squirrel was packin heat
---
Let's see if you feel the same way 50 levels from now after your 500th visit to the vendor.

That seems to be all you're useful for

This is a fucking amazing idea holy shut!

Trolls never seem to realize they're trolls. Baffling.

---
Because the GECK was a post nuclear device created not within the 20 something years this era is developed in we have to make the GECK if you want that
---
Of course, and the person who is completely OK with animals being killed unnecessarily doesn't have any issues.
---
I want high stakes and intense action.
---
Whats the range? My quad double barrel has 50 accuracy, and 72 range, 36 Firerate.
---
classic is classic, the gameplay engages me and very few games have captured me after fallout 1 set the bar in my formative moments
---
It's unavoidable if you disconnect there. Personally I run enough rad resist to rush for the door or enter PA, but it's not fun waiting for the animation to finish while your rads rise.
---
Yeah same, its been horrible all day
---
I'm level 410 and brought my new alt to watoga wearing a vault suit. Phoenix has a unique line of dialogue if you're in a vault suit or super low level.

---
 LOL I was trolling Glowing Ghouls onto security at level 8 in a Hazmat suit. Go for it ... what can happen? ;)  Don't carry any junk, and it does not matter what happens to you.
---
Im not in front of my game but i know its higher than  that for accuracy i know the fire rate is higher on your gun also a quad double barrel is a nutty gun i have a quad double explosive its my favorite 
---
If there are high level players there you can shoot from a distance to tag enemies and then loot them. You have to get a least one hit. I used to shoot them and lure them towards the guards.
---
During the 'Patrol Duty' Event, the robot guard eventually gets to the door of the infirmary, which is locked by terminal..

Some times others, well this had +8 at one point. IT seems to average at 0 but topics like this generally do that.

It‚Äôs ugly but I love ugly things. Not gonna buy it myself but if others want to drop that money they can lol
---
I love the free state mindset - being super capable enough to not need the rest of society to survive - I mean that's not me at all in real life - but its more admirable to aspire to than the member of a corrupt conspiracy or a cog in a military machine.  ...or a d-bag raider.  Responders are cool I suppose - a little on the nose goody goody though - so I'll stick with free states.  Abbie is also adorable.
---
Holy crap, you get notifications about the age of people who are downvoting you? Where can I sign up for this kind of information?
---
It‚Äôs very mainstream and inaccurate to blame the server crashings and lag on ONLY duping.  You can‚Äôt really believe that right? There‚Äôs a lot more too it. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have the greatest severs, server maintenance, etc. I‚Äôm not shitting on them for that because I don‚Äôt have adequate knowledge of them but I‚Äôd imagine they aren‚Äôt at par with other MMO‚Äôs. duping is still around but I would argue that it‚Äôs not the main reason for server crashes or lag, if it contributed at all any more.
---
You can go there as early as 25-30. Just make sure you're decent with some type of melee and carry a couple with you. When the golf club is empty of other players (check your map) run inside so you can aggro some ghouls. Just keep running until you exit through the door you usually spawn near when you fast travel. The the right of the door (while exiting, left when entering) there's a little ledge you can jump to where ghouls have a hard time getting you. Just go ham on them from there.
---
I have a two-shot fat man but it's level 45. Is that still good/valuable?

Chairs / in the 3rd section from the top
---
Ive never duped, but I never would have afforded my first good weapon with out them lowering the price from 35k to 10k.
---
Yeah I've done it pretty much always but latest patch started to cause this freezing.
---
It might not be hardware, the game seems to run fine even though my char is frozen and I can't do anything. I also wonder could cameleon effect somehow be related.
---
Im kinda glad to hear others are getting it too, that way it can become fixed.
---
Maybe if Bethesda actually tried to patch as many issues at once instead of ignoring glaring glitches on launch, maybe it wouldn't be an issue at all.
---
It's like a store just left an item not only out of the display case, but also outside of the store building itself, theres no reason not to take it for free if the store doesn't even really care if it's taken for free or not, idk.
---
I get it. low level dweebs stand around and tag the SBQ.  While a few high level players are trying to take her down.  
---
Quad explosive double barrel is beautiful. I just maxed my pump shotgun and it's stats are 5 fire rate, 72 range, and 9 accuracy. That's absolutely maxed without sacrificing range for accuracy. 
---
What if you could choose from the songs already in game? 
---
It triggers every single time I jump with marsupial. Shit gets real old, real fast.
---
Deflect, deflect, deflect...continue to accept no responsibility it‚Äôs like your all on the same script seriously. Bethesda games a glitchy but not all of us abuse those glitches making the game unplayable for everyone because we have something called empathy and understand in an online game all your actions effect the people around you much like the real world. You can keep lying to yourself and avoiding the facts. But the truth is you are the problem.
---
Yeah I thought it was something to do with that because I've seen them land while doing the brotherhood of steel event where you have to fight a few scorchbeasts but like I said I've never seen one of the roaming ones land and it makes killing them as melee way too frustrating. 
---
So by your standard, rape, incest, murder, and Hilary Clinton are not immoral except that people have made it such? So if you do not agree that they are immoral then you have no problem doing any of the above?

Killing legendaries never advanced it for me. I had to do 10 enclave event quests
---
I mean doesnt change the fact lazy ass Bethesda still hasn't fixed the crazy game breaking bugs.
---
Right it should be better a double barrel wouldnt be better 
---
I've seen exactly one Behemoth in almost 200 hours.  The next rarest would be the Megasloth.
---
The Honey Beast is also rather rare, although you get plenty of them during the Irrational Fears event.  Outside of that event and Nuke Zones, I could count the times I've seen them on one hand.
---
Also they should bring back different ammo for guns 
---
The best is when it's an abnormal location like Charleston or anywhere in the northern part of the map...
---
When you pay for a service, you expect the service to function and not be ruined for you by someone else subscribed to the service. Imagine paying for a premium car wash service monthly that would come pick up your car and return it cleaned, but then you learned someone else was just waiting for new cars to arrive to piss on them after they got cleaned. It doesn't make the service unusable, but that guy is making the service worse for everyone and needs to be removed as soon as possible,
---
i was super dissapointed that system was offline.
---
There are a few safe spots such as on the wall beside the spawn point of the golf course and the pool. If it's safe you can get into the cafeteria and get some beer bottles and make Molotov cocktails they are excellent for low damage but you tag them for heavy xp. Just make sure pacifist mode is enabled. Plus you can always run to the protectron guards if you get overwhelmed. 
---
There's also camo armor that turns you invisible when crouched and stationary.  I've had lvl 60 mobs walk right by this way - though a flying scorch beast seems to eventually hone in on ya.
---
What are the facts? And how am I a problem if I dupe stuff for my friends and I to enjoy the game without crashing servers and we‚Äôre not griefing PVP?
---
I explored there at level 5 lol. You won‚Äôt be able to kill anything but it‚Äôs a fun trip if you just want to sightsee. 
---
Wrong sub sorry
---
Take a break. There's thousands of other games out there. 
---
Whenever someone says they were killed by someone stacking bobbleheads I'm like...how the hell could you possibly know that? It seems like one person on reddit will say it's a thing and then everyone's like, "YEAH! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED!"  
---
To read these threads you would think that duping and stacking bobbleheads is something a majority of players are doing or something.
---
not just whitesprings, also events and sbq
---
That is what I thought. I would run my cores down to single digit % left. Before I logged off for the night, I would refill them. I figured it was some sort of compensation for all of the disconnects. 
---
I‚Äôm down, but why not have the radio tower a camp item. Letting people tune in when in range like the in game stations. Great idea, much better to me than watching twitch or other streaming sites.
---
You were right accuracy is only 6 i was thinking of range thats at 72 but if you have skeet shooter on it doesn't reslly matter my mistake 
---
They bought a license to play the game. They didn't buy a license to fuck it up for everyone else.
---
Fuck your your shitty rationale. 
---
I do it fairly regularly on PS4. It's one way to help stash management :)
---
How many caps? 
---
It wasn't my original question at all.
---
I have the feeling that you don't understand what RNG is or what the parameters are. Luck increases and enhances those parameters. That is all. If you are level 500 and kill a level 91, You have a chance at getting anything on the loot table in any form or fashion. This is not Diablo III or World of Warcraft, OR DESTINY. There is just a table that meshes with other tables and Luck merges those tables with better conditions for said item that drops or maybe it doesn't.
---
Luck is a wildcard. Just because you have 9 points in Luck doesn't mean anything except you can slot 9 points of perk cards into that category. 
---
I hope you read more from wherever you are reading it from because that is hilarious. You have made my night trying to explain something that you haven't claimed to have tested. 
---
And before you say your friend said this and that, screw your friend. He could easily have bought TSE weapons off Ebay then claimed to have had it drop to him 100 times because who knows (he may have duped them in that situation) and it was not YOU. 
---
Don't even believe me on any of this. This has been my experience but I could be totally lieing because I am not YOU. Go test it for yourself.
---
My drop have been awesome with my 15 Luck. That's why it's at 15.
---
Im still doing more damage per second than the rocket launcher.
---
I dont want to take a break i enjoy playing i just wish there was more reasons to play. The game has been out 2 months and now needs dlc
---
Look for the soda fountain and a pink room near the bar area.
---
as rare as those are, that's probably the last thing they'd want to do with it
---
Nuking ur mom soon 
---
same question but on a different account, nice.
---
Oops xD AvengedClayFoldX 
---
The hunting event the computer sends you on at the cabin in the north you have to kill a honey beast I saw a few then not sure if it was because of the event or they spawn up there.
---
It's something like that.
---
A weird mechanic.  It obviously has its purpose, but it makes it really difficult to track nearby players who might want help (all the more reason we need a "Help needed!" kind of thing for the map).
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z_rI3YyqtA4
---
There is another
---
If they shot rusty bullets, sure. But I don‚Äôt think you can get that from lasers
---
Yes, I would like one order of "Life Skills", please?
---
Also, dump your junk in your stash as frequently as possible. If someone does kill you, that's the only thing you drop, is junk. You will need that precious junk. Also, use every opportunity you get to scrap your junk at work benches when you're out exploring. It significantly reduces the weight. All stash boxes in the world are linked to YOUR stash, even the ones at other players camp's. They can also be found at Red Rocket locations. Don't confuse these with the Overseer's stash boxes. You dump something in there and it's free for the taking.
---
Nothing like a shitty analogy to start a classic circlejerk. I bet you spend a lot of time on reddit.
---
Duping is the problem end of story don‚Äôt care why you do it. It messes with server integrity. These are the facts meaning you are problem. 
---
Another analogy, someone robbed a bank, killed a guard and a teller and all of the people in the bank. While the person is getting away, he gives you $10,000 so what he did to get that money doesn't matter, you like him because of the money. 
---
Auto grenade Launcher doesn't get its weight reduced when using the Bear Arms perk. Should be classed as a heavy weapon. Barbarian perk which provides 80DR at max rank isn't working or it isn't properly showing the value change when you toggle it off and on. Anyone else have the Barbarian issue or is it just me?
---
hard to keep up with people who play this game like its a part time job
---
If you think that's all op said I've got a bridge to sell you
---
Agreed. I can foresee griefers will stockpile mini nukes for their post apocalyptic wet dreams.
---
What flaw? Getting scammed like a noob isn't a flaw
---
I don't really understand.
---
But yes, plenty of people will not consider particular murder immoral, so they are ease at doing so. People have different opinions what is immoral and what is not, ultimately they must on some level choose it. Nothing external makes it immoral or not.
---
Particularly in case of helping slaves escape, people have had different views on when it was immoral or not. People have differing views on what is rape, incest too.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. How would I join?
---
Nobody‚Äôs giving me anything. I‚Äôm just playing with people
---
&gt;The flaw that we can't trade item for item. That's a huge flaw.
---
Agree to disagree. How is that a flaw?
---
how much you looking for 
---
No problem 
---
Nope, you are not. I've even messaged people after losing a workshop to let them know there were no hard feelings. I don't like getting one-shot by a TSE shotgun in the hands of a LVL45 any more than anyone else, especially when I'd have been willing to add them to the team, but it's part of the game.
---
Ok learned his lesson
---
And it turns out it's much easier than fixing something that isn't broken
---
Conversely -
---
Once you reach Level 5, you have the option of using Pacifist Mode.  You should enable it, as it prevents you from accidentally hurting other players and gives you some degree of protection against them.  When you see someone with a bounty, or someone trying to goad you into fighting them, be very cautious because they are probably bait for someone else hiding in the shadows.  If someone tries to attack your CAMP, don't be their entertainment.  Just leave.
---
Most players are awesome.  Some aren't.  They pretend to be "Raiders," but few are interested in a fair fight.

Depending on the store policy, then yes, I would and in doing so let the store know that there is an issue on that item. Sometimes I go get a manager and point the issue out for them to correct, and ask if I can get the better price, most large box type stores will do that. 
---
Well sorry you feel that way. But HMU if you want any item on Xbox 
---
That's the stupidest comparison to duping I've ever heard üòÇ
---
It's an easy question. Are you against animal cruelty? Most are. Then by your own standards your actions do not align with your own morals. By the way if anyone actually has a mind of their own and doesn't go into denial deceiving themselves when faced with truth then Melanie Joy Harvard PhD wrote about the phenomenon she labelled carnism.
---

---
Sounds like someone got scammed and is trying to protect.
---
Full set of assassins gear and 12-15k
---
Actually double barrels should be better in accuracy and range. They tend to be longer unless sawn off, and the action creates a better seal to be more reliable, much like bolt action rifles being better than semi autos.
---
Inventory management makes sense, but not to such a constrictive degree.
---
You want to craft something, but you lack the materials. You want to add materials, now you're overencumbered and it won't fit in your stash box. You can't sell ammunition to vendor bots, despite one of their lines being "Now trading for: food, weapons, and ammunition". They don't trade ammo, they sell it at a ridiculous price. You also can't scrap ammo, so you just need to  dump it. If you want to stock up on food and drinks, watch out! Because that'll fill your stash quicker than a Super Mutant filling a porta potty after eating some bad BlamCo.
---
You can't scrap legendary weapons, so you just need to sell them, and vendors rarely have enough caps for more than a couple. You can't keep weapons from your travels as souvenirs, you can't keep a large stash of Nuka-Cola to start selling once player vending occurs, you can't jeep all those cute and wacky things you find lying around the Appalachian Wasteland.
---
It's not fun. It's not a good gameplay mechanic. It's a constrictive force of evil that punishes you just for playing the damn game.
---
I was promised that, despite the changes, I could still play 76 like any other Fallout game. Less role playing (apart from the roles players force upon themselves via character builds and all that good shit), sure, but still similar.
---
So far it's been a pain in the ass.
---
I love this game, but that stash needs an increase.
---
Not infinitely deep or anything, but not something that ends up serving little purpose. Either that, or they make some objects lighter.
---
Yeah me too, I keep trying to move me camp and then it disconnects me. I assumed I was doing something wrong so I'm glad I'm not the only one.
---
well good luck lmao 
---
What about if you melee attack them?
---
&gt;Yeah, no one wants to see the pain and suffering they inflict on sentient gentle beings when they buy products made with their body parts.
---
Fair enough 
---
This is what I wanted from day 1. If your wanted then you would be skulled.
---
Its barely AA
---
With Rust you download the client on to your PC and that is the server.
---
I've been meaning to ask; does bulking scrap make it less intense on your stash box? And, after doing so, do you still use the bulk to craft with?
---
Someone  has already offered me 25k so goodluck to you 
---
[Not a video, but I do have a screenshot](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/screenshot/11385108)

Do you get pvp flagged for that?

not that i don't mind peaked roofs, i just like my sun deck better.

What? There are tons of HAM radios... You can even get them as a handset transceiver.

congrats and thanks ? ü§î

Yessir, 230 cap bounty 
---
There is straight up a GECK in 94 already. Theres footage of it everywhere, just no standard means of getting to it til the vaults open. 
---
Freaking out
---
I know, it's range is like 2 inches.
---
&gt;This game is a scam and you saps fell for it ;D

Go back to watching shit tier youtubers and posting about Rainbow 6.

Saw one a week or two back walking away from Bog Town with a gaggle of regular SMs in tow. Was wild to see one.

Mods can be found in the world for all power armor except X-01 which requires you to buy it from the enclave bunker vendor. Plans may be found for some power armor types.
---
A man accidentally drops his cash from his pocket and it‚Äôs left on the ground. Many days pass and a random stranger picks it up and keeps it. The stranger knows it‚Äôs not his. Is he thief for picking it up and keeping it? 
---
But yes, pump shotguns need more options and also new shotgun ammo types.
---
Sorry, can't join you then. But I can say that crafting your own ammo helps a lot, especially when you get the Ammosmith and Super Duper perks. If you ever need more materials the Breach and Clear event in the Ash Heap can get you enough to make some more rounds
---
Trade menu... Place items and/or caps in one side for items and/or caps on the other side. Items easily traded for items or caps. Crazy something so efficient could be done in fallout 1, 2, and tactics.
---
When was or did fallou76 turn into a camp building game? There are plenty of games u can build a camp in and go explore places..FO76 for me is a survival game building is secondary, but I see so many ppl just wanting to build camps??? Bigger n better , more nostalgic, more griefing to other, more self sustaining..etc blablabla
---
for me FO76 is about exploring..my base is minimal..because I'm not there it's a place to resupply an have a 10 min break..not the game itself...if you want to build something buy some Lego 
---
Fallout 76 is not primarily about building a camp!!
---
Nope
---
I think you can craft one at your armor station.
---
Touhe :) I always exit the game at the train vendor now just in case and never stay at WhiteSpring that way I spawn there if there is a nuke
---
You can get one for free at the meditation place. Cuz meditation places love crossbows.
---
oh heck
---
Get a pc, :)
---
No I don‚Äôt participate in the workshop gameplay 
---
I used to farm springs from the enclave event at seneca rocks visitors center, have like 8-10 yao guais before. Now I don't even see yao guais anymore.
---
I'm with you on that one, I havent played in over a month now and I wont until they delete duped items and or ban accounts. The defense of I paid 60 dollars so I can do what I want is ridiculous. What about the rest of us that paid 60 but cant play because everytime they log in some asshole one shots you, or a legendary enemy, sucks the fun right out of it for us.
---
Max two identical items. After that Bamned!
---
If this ends up happening, then it's time to roleplay an OSHA employee and inspect all those houses.
---
Hey, for future reference you have better luck getting folks to join by posting on the discord in the looking for group (lfg) channel. Usually you can find 3 more people interested in doing the run with you. 
---
Nice!
---
Well it makes sense why you're defending dupers now. You are one! Look, I'm not expecting you to feel bad or something, so there's no need to be defensive. But I'm also not going to lie: I think all dupers should be banned permanently. I'm not after an argument as I CBA with that. I'm just being honest. Hopefully you feel the same.
---
With that out the way, it's really silly to say I "don't see why anybody would critisise Bethesda". I just critisised them lol Come on, I also didn't think I had to say that canvas bag = false advertising fuckup.  That's a given. What im saying is people use a lot of BS to critisise the game too. Remember when it turned out BoS were im the game? r/fallout posted some Bethesda writers Twitter link, instructing people to hound the poor fucker. The trade glitch has been pushed to the point that people often just shoot other people trying to trade with them for fear of losing their best items (turned out the glitch was a lie). There was also the post here about 76 having no encryption. That we'd all get hacked on PC and our characters ruined. Yeah that was a lie, despite thousands of upvotes and being gilded. Remember how 76 is going free to play? Well it's not. The person that originally posted that to this sub even said it was an experiment to see how BS spreads. He posted to say that but people don't care about that. It's all over YouTube and websites. Again, I could go on too.
---
I'm saying people gobble up this stuff because Bethesda. They are blamed for players duping now? What?? Rockstar isn't in GTAO. They also punish dupers. Why is Bethesda given the blame for exploiters? It's not different *because canvas bag*.
---
I do find it odd you listed the dev room in that. To get in there you have to have another cheat engine running (I think?) that exists to cheat in lots of games. Those games aren't blamed when people use that cheat engine. The cheat engine and cheaters are. Except when it's FO76 it's different? You just used it as an example if Bethesda doing something wrong. Surely you See what I'm saying. There's valid criticism to be had but people make up reasons to be angry at them instead.
---
Serious question: if Bethesda bans you for duping (exploits are against ToS), what will your reaction be?
---
I‚Äôm interested, friend! 
---
It's a shame that the mechanics are too classic. I tried going back to the game but it's unplayable for me nowadays.
---
Guess I forgot to mention I‚Äôm lvl144 with a decent setup vs queen. 
---
"Now" it's always been that way. 
---
Just spreading the info so more people know.
---
I agree, the notification is really hard to see. Especially when you are crafting 
---
In atoms
---
I see no piano player! Hahaha :p that's great though
---
That is a joke right?   They really need to buff nonPA armor if armor is to be a thing
---
Okay well where it bugged for me was after I collected all the materials, (yes I only have one of each) after I loaded in the bone meal it never prompted me to load the other three materials in.. it only allowed me to open up the other computer which kept telling me insufficient materials... it won‚Äôt allow me to put in the nitrogen etc... wtf... 
---
That used to be me in grad school. Thankfully I didn't have this game and just played rust and arma like it was my job.
---
Now I work a 9-5 and can come home and play this for a few hours to unwind. 
---
Then you aren't bored
---
i hope you learned a valuable lesson today
---
I mean, if you hit them with your bare hands, then sure
---
Very nice.
---
They started with the board but it went too fast so they ended with fists.
---
They might not be able to without significant engine changes that would carry a high risk of introducing other bugs/issues.
---
no, it is not at all like grinding specific armor drops.  the ability to craft legendary effects onto armor and weapons would be a boost to the barter economy.  people cold trade in services, not just in finished goods.  
---
Betcha no one offered him that. 
---
Also if you 're too low level to wear at least t-45 power armor stay the hell out of the scorch beast queen event.
---
I can't find it on his channel were is it?
---
You still take slap damage in pacifist mode

Denial is rampant in this forum.  Even if something is impossible to deny, it amazes me how many people need to deny them anyway.  Guilty consciences, is my assumption.

Nothing more than a conman‚Äôs ruse. 
---
Why avoid the airport? You can get collision course to start inside the ballast zone. Also there is a garden north of the airport where you can get some violet flux. There is a ton of glowies, just hit the airport, than make a big circle through Morgantown. Also hit up the pub and Morgan town trainyard. 
---
And they seem to know it. 
---
I'd be interested but I'm not sure my wifi will work. I've got a lot of people using it and it goes down sometimes. 
---
It is a event just a little haunted action..read the notes
---
It should be the most recent video on his channel, also his profile pic is kade6 from Destiny
---
We have been nuking Morgan town for some time now definitely not as good as whitespring as no legendaries. Monongah is supposedly the best replacement for WhiteSpring if the condition is right    
---
RNG works in mysterious ways. I'm sorry for your suffering. But I killed a 3 star 2 minutes ago and got a flare gun.
---
Had to do a second take, I thought it was a level 1 with no armour lol
---
I have a bloodied weapon and adrenal reaction.  The damage doesn't display correctly for the bloodied weapon until you equip it.  It will update to the correct damage once you do.  The same goes for any other legendary weapons I'm pretty sure.
---
You could punch it, use the gun melee swing,  or use one of the dozens of other guns the mobs drop in the event.
---
Ahahahahaha. Your stupidity has made my day. 
---
Imagine if it were made of dog skin? The outrage! If people could see those animals as they see their pet dogs, and imagine how their pet dog would feel in that situation, a lot more people would be vegan. But there is a disconnect. A wilful ignorance. A cultural and societal conditioning from birth. One animal is an object to be thrown around and killed for food and clothes. Another shares our homes and gets our love and affection. It's completely unnecessary when there are alternatives for everything made with animal products. So it's a choice. And a choice that not only affects the lives of those innocent animals, but also the environment and our own health is impacted by those choices.
---
It's an easy question for anyone. Are you against animal cruelty? Most are. Then by your own standards your actions do not align with your own morals. By the way if anyone actually has a mind of their own and doesn't go into denial deceiving themselves when faced with truth then Melanie Joy Harvard PhD wrote about the phenomenon she labelled carnism.
---
Because more glowing ones will spawn instead of scorched, watch Rifle Gamings video on it because he explains this in more detail
---
Im pretty sure he wasnt the first one to check their. 
---
The common misconception is that pacifist protects you. It does not. It prevents you doing damage to others and allowing them to initiate unhindered combat because of it.
---
And stairs that snap to small squares
---
He said include it but exclude it he train station, yeah people need to hit the community garden 
---
You have to check monongah to see what enemies are there. Don‚Äôt nuke if it‚Äôs Liberators. 
---
Woah mannnn, imagine 4 nukes. 4 star legendaries all day. 
---
ppl
---
Never seen one
---
Snitch.

---
You know what... We paid full price for the game. If they had delivered an unbroken game it wouldn't have happened.
---
So no. It's not like a store. Because we paid and got a glitchy broken game
---
Killed a 3 star scorched beast Queen as got a 1 star wood chest piece. 
---
There should be a terminal nearby that can trigger those actions.
---
Anyone who posts this response is most certainly a duper. I have been one shot in this manner.
---
I have 10 mutations i believe. They sure change the game
---
I know you can craft the VT university jumpsuit but it doesn‚Äôt have any numbers  on the back.
---
Well fine then. What are your preferred Mire locations?
---
Right. Put the top of your circle just touching the trees to the north. My wife and I have done this for awhile because it‚Äôs easier to farm stuff for flux, without fighting the queen or dealing with Whitesprings.
---
Right, but why didn‚Äôt this person earn a bounty while hitting another player and doing subsequent damage?
---
Did u drop it or place it? U can place 5 PA sets at the same time as long as u have claimed them before even if u log out next time u log back in they will automatically getting recall back to u inventory 
---
You only get a bounty if you kill someone that was in pacifist mode.  Slapping them once or twice won't do it.  Slapping them repeatedly for a long time can.  Also, stacking an insane number of dup'ed bobble-heads and magazines, then slapping them once can do it too.
---
I'd just love if they added C.O.N.T.E.N.T., you know Combat Oriented Narritive Trials Engineered to Need Teamwork. 
---
Bounties only occur when you damage a camp or actually strike the fatal blow on a pacifist player.
---
...yet they play a game they purchased and operate under the rules and construct allowed by the game designers. I don't agree with dupers but I can see the logic. 
---
This is hilarious üòÇüòÇ
---
Just curious, what is your luck stat while farming? I‚Äôve always been curious if it has anything to do with the rarity of what is found as loot. 
---
This is how I feel about so many board games and games in real life where it is easier to cheat. How do people feel good about winning or doing well, when they didn't actually win or do that well, they just cheated? It's like beating a 10 year old in a foot race by getting a head start and then laughing in their face.
---
"Were you at a workshop when the glitcher cheated and one shooted you without slap damage?"
---
&gt; "Yes"
---
Did you know when you claim a workshop, people can PVP you for it? You literally have to skip past a screen without reading it to not know that.

It's not my fault my car got stolen. I just left it unlocked with the keys in the ignition. Or in other words I just released a buggy broken game for full AAA price and some even paid hundreds of dollars to be beta testers while the game should have been in development and beta for many more months before release, so don't blame me that people have exploited the crap out of it.
---
Step 1: Please don't use the minigun. I suggest Gatling gun to save ammo and do 3x damage.

No mods on xBox. Also, setting presets saves zero time if the resource is limited. Why favorite Sugar Bombs if you only have three? They‚Äôll be gone in no time and the game won‚Äôt remember to reassign the preset if you pick up more.
---
I imagine next you‚Äôll say to only carry one type of food. But that poses two problems: 1) it‚Äôs bad design to force gamers to play around inconvenient mechanics and 2) what‚Äôs the point of devs adding all these different items if ultimately the suggestion is to only carry the same things?

Yeah my main has 4, alt has 9 and I find better stuff with my alt. I‚Äôm almost convinced that luck has something to do with it. Found a quad Exp double barrel on my alt the other day, def the best I‚Äôve ever found. Main is lv 200, alt is 80

&gt;Sounds like someone got scammed and is trying to protect.
---
Who or what is op protecting?

Spot on analogy üëå

Enter at the entrance across from the train station if you just want to vendor shop and leave the same way super safe. I made a video let me know if you want it how to enter and exit.
---
I think it was the way I asked it and couldn't get a straight answer.  Lots of hot for AFK but nothing explaining what it is.  Now that I know,  I don't know why so many people have stuck a problem with it.  I mean the hate seemed to be on the level as griefers and dupers, which I didn't understand why not knowing what it meant.   Bridges and courts deserve the scorn,  not sure why AFKers do? 
---
I swear the bot in Flatwoods calls himself, ‚ÄúFarva.‚Äù Makes me think of Super Troopers.

The security and well-being of America and its citizens is a foremost priority. This includes the eradication of regressive genetic abnormalities. 
---
Coulda told anybody that the Morgantown location were the best ingame for nukes... you got more events, more ghouls, plus lots of open no load interiors and more. I've never dropped a Nuke yet between my characters but the location is literally a no brainer compared to every other spot I've seen while fully exploring the map. The airport event will spawn tons of scorched and even a scorched beast for multiple waves and the the food factory spawns tons of waves as well. It's a huge win win for nukes and events at the same time.
---
Just spreading negativity. Really says a lot about you 
---
I was running a single point in luck up until Fallout added the respec option. I had zero three star legendary items at around level 80ish. Currently I have 11 invested in luck and I am level 134. I see three star legendary items maybe once or twice a week if I am actually farming for them. Not sure if luck is the actual reason or not, but something to look into. 
---
Unfortunately true, the minigun looks cool and formidable but it is not that good
---
They‚Äôre just simple idiots.
---
In the most literal definition.
---
Better than a rat king.
---
Speaking of which has anyone else run across the Pied Piper Eyeboy of ~~Hamelin~~ Grafton?
---
Yeah Pete said you needed a new character for the earlier trophies.
---
I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm afraid we cannot let you do this. 
---
Extermination teams have been dispatched. God bless America
---
Couldn't care less. Of course RENOWNED VIDEO GAME CONTENT MAKER YONGYEA made a video on it though so here we are.
---
NAS ‚ÄúIf hip hop should die before I wake, I roll to the station, murder the dj, put an (perforated)extended clip inside of my (hardened) receiver AK.  
---
Fast travel to every station, murder the dj..
---
Shh‚Ä¶the less people know, the less of TSE I have to deal with to take all the kills.
---
Yes, I loved this idea when it was first brought up and we definitely need to keep this alive! C.A.M.P.s are too far apart right now for any sense of community.
---
If Bethesda is looking for a way to implement this, they could make T.O.W.N.S either set locations that are claimable or placeable by a mayor (the player to first claim/place the T.O.W.N.). The T.O.W.N.S. could follow these rules:
---
* A T.O.W.N is a 2 by 2 grid of lots. (T.O.W.N.S can have up to 4 residents)
---
* Teammates of the mayor can place an object in a lot to claim it and become a resident. No other players can build in a claimed lot.
---
* Each lot has a fixed budget.
---
* T.O.W.N.S appear if any of the residents join a server. If residents join different servers, the town only appears for the resident who joined their server first.
---
* \[Maybe\] Adjacent residents can build on the boarder between lots. This would let the townsfolk build some larger central buildings.
---
Ive been off an on for awhile. I've felt no reason to come back because pvp was neglected for so long... and my favorite play-style (my dw/2h heavy att/incap/killers blade gank combo) as you know got nerfed into the ground patch after patch. I played many titles since then and fallout 76 is my new home.  Did i know you in eso? I guess my name on that game got around for being "that rogue ganking guy on DC". 
---
:P  
---
One tip is definitely invest in Lone Wanderer perk for solo, and not use the Action Boy/ Girl perk as it is unnecessary.
---
I don't know if any location in the Ash Heap appeals to me from a CAMP standpoint.  Maybe up near the Hornwright Estate.  It wouldn't be that costly to travel to Watoga and Scorchbeasts tend to keep away from there.
---
Also, in certain lighting, I swear that area gives off a serious Twin Peaks vibe.
---
Happened to me once the same way‚ÄîI lost my brand new first X01 at the time.   I have recovered since‚Äîyou will, too.  
---
The cabins are a fake haunted house and those events trigger in/around them
---
It starts up everytime I'm within 20ft of Flatwoods lol
---
Yeah exactly. I am over encumbered and don‚Äôt dupe. Another day another stupid idea. Why should legit players be penalized 
---
Saw one deck a level 10, it made my day.
---
Hot keys only help if there are plenty of the item and make little sense if there are handfuls of several different types of food/drink/chems. Low quantity items will be gone quickly and the favorite doesn‚Äôt get reassigned to anything else automatically.
---
So why not only carry one type of each thing? First, that‚Äôs adjusting play style to adapt to a bad mechanic, which isn‚Äôt the best thing to do. Second, what‚Äôs the point of devs creating dozens of items if the ‚Äúbest‚Äù strategy is to only carry the same item from each category? At that point they should cut to the chase and simply have one food and one drink item. Which humorously would be counter to the pursuit of realism.
---
I got a vampire's hatchet lvl 1 from an eye bot yesterday.  Went to vault 76 and found a guy to give it to.
---
Well this may be a bit late but I just came across some poisoners combat armour that adds poison resistance as a top tier legendary mod
---
I edited the post the to show that a bit better
---
thanks ! I really enjoy them 
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt believe you. Why would you claim something like this with what seems to be a throwaway account?
---
Fusion cores I could see being OP because that's technically infinite power armor (despite finding enough that you shouldn't really run out) but infinite carry weight? If you're not duping that shit hurts no one.
---
The issue of using glitches isn't black and white. That's like if there was a glitch for free fast travel and people abused it, it hurts no one.
---
Now from Bethesdas perspective, infinite carry weight is pretty serious because of the fact dupers will abuse that shit.
---
I‚Äôve seen it once behind vault 76. Scared the crap out of me so I ran for my life
---
Why use the Gorge Workshop? Black Titanium? Make friends with Deathclaws.
---
Lost my entire set of ultracite armor while putting it on a new frame :(
---
No, but that sounds awesome.
---
Yeah me to love nuking Morgantown for a  relaxed time. Will check out the the trees next time. I think I do it just slightly below the train station but include the community garden.
---
Build your camp on seneca rocks, beautiful scenery and griefers won't bother to climb up the mountain to wreck your base.
---
Not the same remark.  I have had 13 tickets with them in a month to try and resolve my issue and have gotten nothing.
---
I saw a moth an once, I went to shoot it and shot. It the proceeded to go down the fly quick up into the air and go away. Scared the crap out of me
---
It‚Äôs a whistling eyebot followed by half a dozen tame rats.
---
I killed the rats for meat then killed the eyebot for spreading pests and disease.
---
The last Inside the Vault said they were aiming for the end of January.
---
And fucking flare guns! Killed a 3 star ghoul and was blessed with a flare gun...
---
I don't think luck affects item or stars, only durability. No stars can drop non Legendaries or 1 star. 1 star drops 1 star or less. 2 star drops 2 star or less. 3 star drops 3 star or less.
---
I build a small town with a shop and apartments next to the overseers camp. It‚Äôs very nice, but I‚Äôm out of camp budget and I want to expand my apartments 
---
Happened to me once I got disconnected when trying to grab my junk, I finally found someone in that server to go back to. Nobody took my junk thankfully, don‚Äôt know how but I got really lucky.
---
Talking about you. It's ok if you got scammed. Nothing to be ashamed of.
---
...
---
I wasnt rewarded the armor set for completing the mission
---
Try relogging
---
I had a few players get away from me killing them..#sadraider
---
You're acting as if 4 stars don't exist. 
---
I think it also takes into account the awkwardness of some items, in addition to their raw weight.
---
I don‚Äôt want to talk with strangers. So I have kept it off. And from my experience with others so far, I don‚Äôt feel like I want to hear what they say. Just yesterday a player in a power armor pushed me into a corner and started to jump the air. And today someone chased me around while I tried to do some vendoring. 
---
Did that.   This was earlier today.   Got back on after dinner still nothing. 
---
Rip
---
After the TSE nerf, my minigun which is 104 damage, will be around 30, and a default minigun is 14 damage already. It will be trash. 
---
When you get a new set of perk cards.
---
Perk pack ;)
---
There‚Äôs a reduced weight fat man called the daisy cutter, it‚Äôs worth it. 
---
Some do with mods
---
But you can't launch 4 nukes
---
Hey now, I've got a nocturnal pool hook...granted it's also got faster swing speed. At night, that thing does a ton of damage!
---
Oh man, do you kill him or not.  Actually can we even
---
Got a whole bunch of rare resources, while running by the farming spot for ghouls at the golf club, a high ass level swung and accidentally 1 hit me. He tried to revive me but I died then a level 12 came by and picked it all off and left. Was finally to get the x-01 jet pack but lost the hardened mass. Those little shits.
---
I know how you feel. One time, me and a buddy got destroyed by a guy twice our level while we had bounties on our heads, and this level 3 and level 12 just took our junk. We couldn‚Äôt do anything to the level 3, so we followed the level 12 all around the map trying to kill him and get out stuff back. He kept stimming his self when he got low and when we were finally about to take him down, he just logged off with our stuff. Sad day :(
---
i thought i read somewhere that the marine dense torso plans are also called dense combat armor torso. so yeah.
---
80 queens dry of a serum recipe
---
Probably fell from the satellite the BOS used to form a completely new chapter in WV.
---
It‚Äôs a common excuse to claim availability means permission. As if they‚Äôre incapable of simply choosing not to do it. My favorite part is the inevitable ‚Äúbut others do it!‚Äù.
---
These people need psychiatric help. Extensive.
---
Lol will do thanks for the tip I'm thinking about making a new character should I do quest to level up and gain gear and weapons or is there a better method at progressing?
---
God. I ran into a couple of those people today. Me and my buddy started new characters and we‚Äôre making our base. Then two lvl 100 come and blow it all to hell. When we asked why, there excuse was ‚Äúwe have nothing else to do in this game‚Äù
---
I have three of them. Bought them off of other players who were posting their for-sale items in a Fallout 76 community group on PSN. TSE Combat Shotgun: 3.5k. TSE Automatic Handmade Rifle: 4k. TSE .50 Cal Machine Gun: 4.5k. Caps well-spent. Pretty sure they were duped. But fuck it. Not my problem. 
---
Be careful with the beta characters. It didn't give me the level 100 achievement which is holding me up to go platinum.  I had to start a new character. Hopefully they fix that problem.
---
Some non daily get abandoned also
---
I have 3 luck and so far every 3\* legendary has dropped a 3\* item, not that i farm them or encounter them all that often, 1 or 2 a play session usually
---
do you have a lvl 50 2 shot handmade or lvl 50 2 shot combat rifle for sale? i don't really want explosive.
---
Given that one dup method involved crashing the server, ruining others game, I do not feel so bad for them getting banned. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a single player game. What you do affects others experiences. 
---
Maybe one solution is sandboxing those who want to use mods. But, then again, that would take programming efforts and services, away for development of in game content and bug improvements. 
---
Turned off pacifist mode to get the bounty kill achievement, had the berserker fat man around 1200 damage snuck up on the guy and hit him. Did nothing to him. Do they still have to attack you even if they are wanted to agree to do damage to each other.
---
Did the same to me :[
---
Oh thats interesting. 
---
 I believe there are 2 plans with the same name and only one works on Combat Armor. I believe the other works on Marine Armor.
---
 I know from looking for Dense for my Heavy Combat Armor Torso. I did find a Dense mod and will apply it when I get a level 50 Heavy Combat Torso. Its hard to find. I have never seen the plans.
---
 My BOS Heavy Combat Armor is quite amazing and Dense will just be icing. ;) 
---
There is a problem with the Dense Combat Armor Plan. Apparently, dense marine armor plan and dense combat armor plan have the same name. You probably got the one for marine armor.
---
Let me know when your on ill be on all night
---
appreciate the offer, but I like to find things myself... which probably explains why my gear isn't that great... but still :P Thanks though!
---
I am on now
---
That sucks man. I think I would have just given up on the game if I lost something that valuable, at least for a while. 
---
Dense combat armor plans can be a 50/50 crapshoot of getting either marine armor or the actually combat armor even though the plan says Combat Armor right in the title. Sounds like you got the marine plans. They really need to fix this stuff. 
---
I‚Äôm new to the internet. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think what occurred here was a ‚Äúsick ass burn‚Äù. 
---
Ha, after moving my camp and rebuilding a new house last night, I noticed 2 groups of 2 not far from my camp. 
---
Turns out one of the groups was a pair of people with close camps, and the other two was a pair of trolls firing missiles at one of their houses. I saw one of the guys being attacked as I was getting close, and he gave me the ‚Äúfollow‚Äù emote, leading me to where his buddy was under attack by a pair of dipshits. 
---
So I did the logical thing- started claiming bounties off the attackers. Was probably the most fun I‚Äôve had in a couple weeks, hitting these goons with my TSE pump action. In the end, I made a couple new friends and we went scorchbeast hunting down in the bog. 
---
That‚Äôs usually a common event that people use to farm legendaries, so it seems kind of odd that was all that you got
---
Ah ok \*slaps forhead\*
---
I usually go to Watoga after my friends have logged off and run around farming the random legendary's that spawn there. I've made probably a 1000 laps around that city and have not gotten a single weapon. All armor, mostly wooden. It sucks. 
---
... crazy long pause... sigh, why am I even bothering, nobody is going to hear this.
---
Lol yeah. I'm gonna guess your a low level and new to the game.
---
I good now and no
---
They were created from the mist in Far Harbor, but their actual reliance on the mist to survive is debatable.  Officially, the only evidence we have is a load screen hint in 4 that says they are "seldom seen" outside of it.  Not that they can't be.
---
Since Fog Crawlers are billed as something of an apex predator, it stands to reason that, like Deathclaws, they probably expanded their range over time.  To be perfectly fair, they are a somewhat rare sighting in 76.
---
We just make sure to get the trees so we don‚Äôt miss the garden. I‚Äôve nuked to where the garden was just outside. Lol. But def check out the trainyard if you haven‚Äôt. Also Back on the Beat event is good as well. 
---
You got the one for Marine armor. They're named identically.
---
It's kind of pervasive. Bethesda only recently fixed the duplicate Brick Building plan (one was Advanced Power Connectors). Missile Launcher is missing the second i.
---
+karma
---
Damn thats considerate af.
---
Bird bones mutation helps negate this a little since it makes you fall slower. You have to fall further for it to activate.
---
Dude, I still freeze if I travel to Charleston and they broke that shit on the first patch. People working this game should be fired. Shareholders should know the idiots on this game are driving it into the ground with these decisions. I'd be furious if I was invested. 
---
They sell for 25 caps with 5 charisma and no perk card also.
---
Probably depends on your friends. I don't like playing with high level friends cause their gear can trivialize the combat, so I would probably ask you to play a new char. :P
---
Probably quests because the xp from completion and from enemies. When you get to around 50, buy weapons on reddit.
---
Make sure you have the armorer perk on
---
16 caps with 5 charisma no perk card.
---
Yeah it sucked. I was around level 60 at the time and hadn't crafted my x01 yet.
---
I like the protectron helping you with camps who really despises the dead guy.
---
I found 3, 3 star ghouls but all trash, I was wondering what you get after the event is over, for the event loot.
---
to be fair if a store is suffering from a lot of theft but unwilling to invest in security, on some level it becomes their fault.     it is peculiar that they haven't fixed this bug yet, maybe they don't want to spend the resources, maybe they don't have the resources.
---
I have 11 on my guy and I find that when I kill 3 stars I mostly get 2 or 3 star legendaries and 2 stars about 2/3 the time I get 2 stars.
---
I respect your opinion no worries about me getting defensive! 
---
I understand your points but I can type out a bunch of exploits and game issues that are not falsely advertised like some youtubers try to stretch out for some click bait, and they aren‚Äôt to be discredited like the numerous exploits in the game or the bugged quests, etc.  I mean yeah I deserve to be banned but honestly I don‚Äôt think I will get banned. 
---
Hypothetically if I were to get banned I wouldn‚Äôt mind. The exploits make the game enjoyable, my peers see it that was as well. We‚Äôd just move on to another game if anything, life goes on *shrugs*
---
WV is home to Crayfish (AKA Crawdads), they could come from those.
---
You may want to try treasure maps, as BoS plans are on the list for the Toxic Wastes at least. I found my first BoS chest plan there.
---
Ok let me log
---
It sheds some weight off the stored materials, and if you should need them in the future, the game will break them out of their bulk state when you craft.
---
The most important use remains selling it though.  Bulking tends to highlight what you are and aren't using.  If you've got 15 bulks of Cloth, and little to use it on, then you could sell it for a decent profit and/or stop collecting so much Cloth. :)
---
Fog Crawlers are shrimp

---
But Far Harbor takes place way after 76
---
Add me bombo420
---
I know that.  The OP apparently doesn't since he's equating 'illegal' with 'wrong'.
---
Pacifist mode isn‚Äôt like Passive mode on GTAO. You can‚Äôt damage other people or their stuff, but they can see hurt you. Although the damage is very very minor. I tested this by using TSE dragon and a flame thrower on a friend (he knew what was going on). It took a while to kill. The reason to be on pacifist mode, is so you don‚Äôt shoot them and then turn on PVP. Where you can then be 1 shotted.
---
honestly at this point, bethesda needs to appease everyone who is still willing to play this game 
---
Oh god, I should have knowm everyone at work was wearing mirrors!
---
There is a sub for lore but I don‚Äôt know how active. I would assume due to a lack of communication. Wasn‚Äôt BOS founded in 2076? They would have lacked more modern technology and I think that‚Äôs the only way I could guess
---
Build a camp somewhere in the NE use the vertibird crash spit server hope til you find a solo tameable and no your level doesn't matter compared to the creatures.
---
I occasionally get a crash or an infinite loading when trying to fast travel. They‚Äôre annoying but you can close down and re-open and you‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs not a real loss or anything. But when I‚Äôve been saving lead and building up my 5.56 as I knew what weapon I wanted to use as my main and then to have it all ripped away. That is something inexcusable. 
---
I play solo N have lots of fun
---
Way back in November, Morgantown used to be the only spot I saw nuked. Then someone said whitespring on Reddit and Morgantown was done for. 
---
I am at my camp whats your gamer tag
---
I'm a bit out of the loop right now, what exactly is going on with explosives in Uranium Fever?  I'm away how frequently legendaries spawn in it because of how I used it to finish officer on deck, but I've seen multiple posts by now saying there's a problem going on with it.
---
I was charged an additional 10 bucks for going over my data cap when I decided to download and play Dragon Quest XI after abandoning 76 in the second week. 
---
Pretty unlucky.
---

---
Crawdads are pretty much freshwater shrimp.
---
Pick one melee type and one ranged type and stick with two things to specialize in.  It doesn't work spreading perks all over the place.
---
No way in hell is a deathclaws taking up that space man. I've tamed several deathclaws/animals and had many glitches and even lost pets I've never seen one take that much budget space.
---
Uhm... duping is not within the rules OR construct.  It is not something which was intentionally designed to be done.  
---
Mobs to do 5 times their normal damage make it so engaging a player is even more risky with mobs around.
---
People exploit "the game" in real life why wouldnt you think people would cheat in an online game also seems like more of a loop hole then full on cheating
---
Fog crawler. Only seen one so far. Saw everything else at least 2x. Lvl 92 @ 221 hrs
---
Might be a bit much there.  
---
My camp is se of pleasant valley station
---
Not sure what this has to do with intentionally breaking rules...
---
Gorge workshop? Oh what‚Äôs that? Your server crashed after you took control? Ya F that. 
---
I don't like Dodges. Hey-o!
---
It is possible Fog Crawlers fully evolved shortly after the Bombs dropped, with their speed and durability they probably migrated all across the East coast including the damp climate of the Bog and the Mire.
---
You are not an asshole. Lolz
---
Thank you for the kind words! 
---
I did some more testing: Using both Excavator arms together will increase the yields of each vein, allowing for multiple gatherings. Only arms on a suit gave me 14 with 4 veins (about 3.5 per vein average), whereas the full suit gave me 60 (15 per vein average) . There is definitely a hidden bonus for using a full suit, but even if you have only the arms it'll give you a slight advantage.
---
Scrapping stuff with steel is a good option, mining is a good alternative too. Both are survivalists taking advantage of what they can get :-)
---
Meh, I just don't buy anything from the Market.  Farm it myself or get it from another player I know. 
---
Same issue here and only thing I have found to fix it to to totally dissemble and rebuild. Every time I have done that it has been rebuilt with free camp budget space. It has to be a bug that I really wish they would try to fix at some point. 
---
That would be so awesome, and present a whole new way of enjoying the game. Just a way of exploring the world and the community. That's the sort of thing that could make the world feel real, and lived in, and really make the community outshine the limitations of the game.
---
No. The BoS was formally founded days/weeks after the war. Informally however Maxson declared himself and his unit AWOL after discovering what was going on really at Mariposa, this was a few days before the war happened. 
---
You need to learn them before you can get shielded
---
And that was the last thing Pete ever said lol
---
5000 candy prize is iirc a 3* random legendary
---
But the few days before they wouldn‚Äôt have spread across the US. It would have to have been after
---
I have bear arms perk for my main I think it‚Äôs lvl 3 so it‚Äôs pretty light
---
Fyi that includes the dupers who only still play because they have fun doing wacky crap.....u cant appease everyone.
---
Killing the SBQ and having my game crash after I looked her, and not having the 3 star shotgun save.
---
The logs will show if the person dupes a single item, or if it is something this person does chronically.  That is the difference. 
---
Grim reapers sprint with high agility also weapons legendarys that take less vats with medics is good
---
I have it maxed and it's still full weight and it makes me a sad heavy
---
okay, I heard people got 1 stars so it must be a random chance 
---
Sounds similar to when I scrap a piece of armor and I get the message that I learned so-and-so mod, but said mod never shows up, even after relogging, in my list of possible mods for that armor type.  This has happened at least twice to me.
---
This guy, this guy gets it
---
The game addresses this. Basically after settling into their base at Lost Hills they used the, at the time, still functioning satellite network to reach out to other surviving military personnel. 
---
Depends on how much they want you to carry them and if you mind carrying them.
---
True, he can server hop. But so can you.
---
So if there‚Äôs no way to payback, I‚Äôm doubting bored folks will play?
---
How could you put all 2000 rounds in the machine?
---
I have same problem. 16 lvl yao guai died in my camp and still take 10% of my budget.
---
Moving camp to another place don't help.
---
Hard to say. 
---
You'll one shot everything but you can get around that with a crap gun.
---
Scaling outside of the forest will be rough though
---
YES!
---
I wish the game would let you domesticate animals. My camp needs an indoor cat.
---
So your saying me witnessing someone massacre 10+ people who ran over to loot their SBQ is a lie? Either this is a different exploit or someone needs to do some more testing. He was using an explosive minigun. 
---
So... Looks like it'll be pretty hard to maximize VATS crit output and use mutations with all these luck points I need.
---
I'm also more concerned with things like SBQ, but I guess I could focus on killing adds to proc grim reaper
---
Organization isn't the problem here, it's storage space. I'm not saying to get rid of the current stash boxes, they can still be used as universal storage for non camp related things, like if you were overencumbered and wanted to drop your unneeded loot at the nearest Vendor station or Red Rocket instead of walking all the way back to your camp. But having camp specific storage spaces would not only give us a use for all the containers in the storage section, but it could also hold our stuff that we don't need right away. For instance, I've been throwing away all of my higher level weapons and armor, as well as all my heavy ammo and chems simply because I can't spare the weight. So it would be nice to have a place to store all of that stuff until I'm ready to use it. It would also be nice to be able to display your power armor when you aren't using it (They could balance that by limiting the number of power armor displays you can make). 
---
I can completely agree with you on that good sir I was just saying from my point of view when I was first playing there was no high levels as it was still beta and I went to watoga it was so scary as I fought my fist wentigo at Appalachian antiques at level 9 üòÇ I‚Äôm just saying that that‚Äôs what I did as I wanted to be a higher level than all my friends as I‚Äôm competitive af although I rushed through the start of the game it was still ridiculously fun to do
---
Also coffins.
---
You say yourself.....that's an assumption.  My assumption is they cant do that......except mine is based on evidence.  If it was easy to do it would have been done......if they could do it they would have no reason to nerf a TSE weapon so much that it becomes useless......a tactic often used by developers when a certain thing happened due to exploits......in this case people duped tse.....they nerf it to hell so it doesnt matter it was duped.
---
Example: Destinh vault of glass boss was easily pushed off by warlocks.....causing ton of people to have the vex mythical fusion gun.  So they nerfed the gun to fix a problem they couldn't fix otherwise.  In this case there was no way to know who pushed Arheon off or who killed legit......so they used nerfing to combat the exploit after removing the exploit. 
---
Bethesda thinks they got rid of the ability to dupe....now they nerf the duped item.  If you think this isnt the case go research other overpowered items gained through exploits in other online games.
---
Also if you get AP regent on your armor that could work really well, you will also want adrenaline and gun Fu
---
Lookout towers took their place.

Chickens. Always a rare spawn. I want to keep them!
---
Sorry for the delay- had to go take care of some stuff. I have it spawned again, if you're still online.
---
Could you imagine? Your running amok in the wasteland, and some dude in a cowboy hat with his legendary single action revolver stops you and asks over proximity chat ‚ÄúHave you seen so and so? Their wanted for the murder of so and so, and have a bounty of ‚Äòcaps‚Äô.‚Äù This would add a lot of role playing aspect to the game, and something I would thoroughly enjoy.
---
Yeah I'm with the "and...?" party on this take
---
The vault is not able to be used anymore since the attempted patch. Only spawn is closest and no longer the vault 76 option. 
---
kinda my point, though.. they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.. what if these griefing duping players are also buying skins from the atom shop?   
---
Because while you‚Äôre loading in the canisters it will randomly change a canister name to a type of ammo. And all it takes is you pressing A (which you do to try and load 15+ canisters without taking ages) and it instantly transfers all of that ammo into the container and it immediately vanishes so you can‚Äôt even take it back. It ‚Äúshould‚Äù only allow the quest canisters to be put in as no other inventory items show up, however it will randomly assign a canister ammo. I‚Äôm guessing it must do it for the equipped weapon. 
---
Atomic shop shouldn't touch most of the above listed items. Most of this should be included with a faction update.
---
Of you wondered why?  I of.  I of wondered it a lot.
---
Not as much as I could of, should of, or would of.  But I of!  I sure of.  I of wondered it so often.
---
The Zealot's effect does not work on Scorchbeasts, only on Scorched. You would only get the additional damage from having the prime receiver. If your handmade is 1\*, I'd probably just sell/release it to the ether, 2 or 3\* you can probably get some caps from trading groups/discords/etc. depending on the effects. Popular queen weapons are bloodied melee or ts/e. The furious prefix works but it takes a while for the damage to be visibly affecting the queen and you need total accuracy or else the effect resets. 
---
Two-Shot and Explosive are getting nerfed next patch, though they are still \*somewhat\* useful (just not as OP as it was before). I would also say Anti-armor/anything crippling will be good for fighting SBQ, since you want to damage the wings/limbs to get it to land. Optionally, keep your eyes peeled for a nice cryolator to freeze the queen, this will give everyone more time to inflict damage.
---
The concept of Vault raids will hopefully become a reality during Q1 or Q2, that should give some nice endgame content with needed Teamwork. Hopefully...
---
I'd really like to know how to fix this.
---
I've tried to pacify with animal friend...no luck.  I'd love a cat hanging around my camp and not running away
---
Heckling Overachieving Assholes

1. Is the prime receiver automatic? I would advise against using automatic, the ultracite bullets requires some farming. TSE is still the gold standard right now. I'm using a TSE lever rifle with ultracite receiver with full rifle perks, demolition and low life (nerd rage + adrenal reaction), it's 2-3k damage per shot. I still prefer to carry a universal weapon than a few weapons for different enemies which takes up space.
---
2. Haven't tried crossbow, not sure the damage and the range are good for SBQ.
---
If I were melee, I would stick to shotgun or heavy weapons. Would be better to invest in adrenaline perk in agility rather than going for rifleman. The idea here is to kill a few scorched to maximise your damage before going for SBQ.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is still young in this time period, so much of the rank stratification is likely not in effect. Taggerdy, for example, was the head of the Appalachian detachment and was a Paladin. At this point, your central ranking system is likely limited to: Initiate, Scribe, Knight, Paladin, and Elder. This time period is very cloudy in the way of lore, and exactly where the ranks start to subdivide is equally cloudy. I stress that the following is my personal opinion, only, but I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs around the current time where we would start to see the additional ranks of Senior Scribe, Knight Sergeant, Knight Captain, and Paladin Commander start to form out of necessity as the Brotherhood grows and expands. With global/national communications limited to nonexistent, Elder Maxson would be likely needing to extend the ranks to operate without his direct guidance. The even greater strata of ranks, I think we‚Äôd be a little ways out before we start seeing those. 
---
I loved the Regulators in Fallout 3, I had hoped for an early Regulator faction in Fallout 76, with roaming lawmen acting as bounty hunters to take down criminals and other misfits with a bount of caps on their heads.
---
Legendaries are crap in Morgantown, also I never counted them but I still don't buy that there's more glowing ones from Morgantown than Whitespring.  They're more spread out in Morgantown, so you might feel like there's more encounters, but maybe less people show up, but from my experience it doesn't feel like there's more glowing ones.
---
My username here is a lie. There is another.
---
A system similar to the permanent posses from Red Dead 2 would be great for this.
---
So this set up magical ignores the two confirmations needed to deposit all ammo?
---
I find that a bit bs because I've only seen armor and weapons show up the dozen or so times I've done this.
---
It is also why I don't spam click on the ingredients after I get down to last 5.
---
I do wish they could remove the duped items though. I don't even r 3ally care about banning the dupers, I just want the items gone.
---
Honestly I'd just be happy if every Legendary enemy actually dropped some gear. Had three or four this weekend that dropped nothing. One was a three star Legendary Ghoul at Harper's Ferry that took quite a bit and caused an annoying ruckus and then dropped... duct tape. Just duct tape.
---
Eh, id rather have those events than a buggy and laggy location to nuke over and over.
---
Welcome to Fo76 lol.  Your lucky he let you have some shots in, all the PvP I come across it‚Äôs who shoots first with TSE and that‚Äôs it, no pleasantries and what-not.  
---
no because there is a mouth harp that you can't build, unless they fixed that
---
"If it was easy to do it would have been done... "     you don't know how Bethesda operates lol. 
---
This is sick and twisted... I approve.
---
Fireproof fixes that for the most part
---
This is the first time I‚Äôve had it happen, while pressing A I saw the name change a split second before pressing A and it immediately took everything. I had no pop up what so ever to select a quantity. Not sure if it was because I had my handmade equipped at the time so it selected the ammo or what. But everything went in a flash. 
---
Yeah! That would work!
---
Are you saying you ofn,t?
---
same here.
---
 You're the worst kind of player. And here I thought that I was the dick by one-shotting everything during nuke runs. But then I met you.

*Reddit is being regularly manipulated by large financial services companies with fake accounts and fake upvotes via seemingly ordinary internet marketing agencies.*
---
‚ÄúI work with a number of accounts on Reddit that we can use to change the conversation. And make it a bit more positive.‚Äù
---
This was the startling admission of a professional-looking marketing agency that, in a phone call with me, openly bragged about manipulating conversations on Reddit.
---
Reddit.JAY MCGREGOR
---
This wasn‚Äôt a one-off, nor was it the result of weeks of plumbing the depths of the dark web looking for shilling services. Finding this agency, and several others, took less than a few hours of basic Googling.
---
The business of Internet shilling - posing as a genuine forum user but being in the employ of a corporation to promote their work - is booming. And it has been for a long time. From [fake Amazon reviews](https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/amazon-continues-crack-down-on-alleged-fake-reviews-site/) to the [U.S Army astroturfing social media](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks), comment manipulation is as old as the very concept of internet forums.
---
Fake comments and fake conversations being hard to spot, especially when they‚Äôre made by specialist agencies, makes shilling big business.
---
Nowhere is this more apparent than on Reddit. Being the world‚Äôs 22nd most popular website and the U.S.‚Äô 7th makes it a popular target because of the hundreds of millions of eyeballs it attracts every month.
---
[In December last year](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/12/14/how-we-bought-reddit-for-200/#6102cd3f7e14), I managed to place two *entirely* fake news stories onto influential subreddits - with millions of subscribers - and vote them to the top with fake accounts and fake upvotes for less than $200. It was simple, cheap and effective.¬†

A agree! I wear this all the time. Make it work!
---
I missed nothing
---
It is a person crying as usual because they have never played an online game before and have never had to deal with the harsh realities that not everyone is going to play the way they want them to. 
---
Empathy on the issue is pointless, I cannot empathise because I have played online games before where out of the blue someone who is bored and looking for a challenge or an unchecked child are just out to wreck your day. Also dealing with real criminals in real life - you know most "bad guys" are people looking for an easy take or challenge the system in place, oh and kids looking to wreck your day.
---
I can think of a lot of other things that can wreck my day - none of them have to do with a video game, and complaining about it on a world wide forum would get a lot of jeers and laughs from (get ready) assholes who just want to wreck my day.
---
I sure hope your mastery of comprehension in the English language can handle my very basic verbiage without prejudice.
---
That just added another week of raging on folks.
---
It‚Äôs a know issue they will fix ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.
---
50/50 about respawns. Leave the server quickly for a better chance. Crytids can't be tamed, maybe snallygaster though. Deathclaw recommended, Mirelurk 2nd. Never the sloth. Sloths get stuck easily. 
---
No legendary gear + full loot or nearly full loot, sounds awesome to me.
---
I've had nice duels with my main character (lvl 59) that were good and friendly, I'm guessing he really didn't want to lose to a level 9. Lol ain't my fault he's a shit fighter.
---
I really like this idea, although to make it work I think you need to allow up to 8 player stop build in a T.O.W.N. this would foster more of a community effort feel by having multiple teams (2 or.more) working and living in proximity
---
I feel like the change in xp from glowing ones also changed the loot tables. I remember getting a lot more multi Star legendaries, now they almost only drop one stars. 
---
.SQB feels way more tanky lately than previously as well, but could just be me. I'm worried the changes to TSE will make downing her a much less common, much more costly occurrence.
---
That being said I have two full sets of lvl 50 armor and a couple of TSE weapons so there's little motivation to blows hundreds or thousands of rounds on the SQB
---
You think they'd risk it? Especially with how shitty things have gone so far?
---
Yeah it's a bug, unequip log out re equip
---
Or supermutants 
---
Are The Scorched playing tonight too?
---
I saw one near where the savage divide meets the mire and it was possibly the saddest thing ever. It was fighting off two Yao Gauis, so I decided to help it kill them. We get the job done and I go on to head off when I find a dead baby sloth... I went back and put the mom out of her misery.
---
Ghouls wearing golf uniforms at the Whitespring
---
So i put some work into my douboe barrel explosive i got the accuracy up to 51 with a range of 72 fire rate 44 its crazy 
---
Now I have only explosive, I want TSE. When and if I'll get TSE I'll be needing some other TSE weapons. So it's just the chase for might. The point of mmo is to get stronger.
---
Cheating in multiplayer is also part of the reason so many people hate PvP and just won t even bother playing it.
---
Yup, that worked. Thank you! 
---
I mean come on already
---
To be honest, this is the entire reason I got a jetpack. Marsupial, especially with Strange In Numbers on, is more than enough to get you anywhere you need to go. If I'm using my jetpack, it's to negate my crash landing that I have to deal with *every single time* I jump.
---
Versus banning people who listen to music over the mic, while playing 76?   Stuck between a rock and roll and a hard place.
---
This is the story of my entire weekend
---
By the way shills. I have been an ordinary user. Now I will become your worst nightmare.
---
Spent 2+ hours building myself a lovely camp, great location (but very finicky for building), went to move one item, it redeployed my camp instead as though it was a new location. My stuff blueprinted but due to the aforementioned finickyness, couldn't get it back the way it was before despite spending a few hours more trying. 
---
You shouldn't take "pleasure" in stirring the pot. That's an asshole and childish joy to experience. Grow the fuck up man. Help others, don't encourage trolling. This gan6e community was good till people like you get this idea?
---
he goes further under the whitesprings bunker entrance i have a camp there and saw him yesterday
---
Yeah I agree, although I feel WhiteSpring has been nerfed in the amount of enemies spawn now, I tried to get them to respawn and nada, so maybe they decide to limit the amount of respawns .. also zero legendaries in MorganTown, so it is more for a relaxed nuke and flora, I enjoyed it when I somebody nuked it and I since nuked and people looked like they were having fun.
---
hahaha excellent you damn right it is :)
---
Florida man: "Well, the front door was unlocked..."
---
I'm not talking about stirring the pot here. I'm just talking about watching it. Lol
---
I had some thoughts on this about the survival mode. I'll copy some here for contribution to the discussion:
---
Example of what true fans of the survival mode want - Requiring a character to first reach a decent level such as 40 in adventure and then copying over as a level 50 with respec and new vault exit with no inventory.
---
They want a higher difficulty with more complexity so the interactions with players have high impact and drama, as described in the official announcement of survival mode. the purpose of start fresh is so the challenge level is even for all. The idea is that the rarity of supplies all the way through a character‚Äôs progress, so that ‚Äúbeating‚Äù the survival gameplay is made almost impossible, since players are made more often to have a broken weapon, starvation, disease, radiation creates the higher stakes of possibly unfriendly interactions.
---
So that the player choices are going to be truly based on survival situations, somewhat randomly provided by the environment. Like, maybe a player found a rare weapon and when it breaks it only then respawns in such a way another player could claim one, if they couldn‚Äôt get it from the existing player holding it, and in order to renew its repair you had to get that specific spawn point , creating points of contention and using the scarcity of specific equipment create a real Survival mode feel, places people are hoping to recover something very important which might not even spawn as the exact thing they need but it will be something rare for sure. A system where competition narratively makes sense because everyone can‚Äôt have everything. I can‚Äôt think of a way leaderboard could make this experience better if done right, so that may end up being scrapped. It sounds useless. Real good pvp gameplay happens within repeatable player traffic to specific locations.
---
I guess I‚Äôm somewhat describing a hunger games like space. I recently saw that series for the first time. 
---
In this mode, I can see it making sense that you have access to a more full build, like a level 40 start but with all perk cards choosable and the ability to fill the card picks you‚Äôve gained for 2-40. The idea is to have the progress be framed by survival- equipment, supplies, and camp establishment and level up. where camps gain sufficiency gradually. A process that is ideally / necessarily done through only team work, whether just your multiple characters, as the industrious loner base, or you and friends in TOWNS, which could be permanent replacements for workshops owned by a clan of players / characters.
---
I woke one morning, I was achy and tired.
---
I grabbed my rifle, and went down to the mire.
---
I think its so the loadings seem faster 
---
Well maybe you were on a team? And one of your friends did something unruly?
---
Very nice.  Do you use enforcer? I highly suggest for scorchbeasts.
---
My group originally thought the Camp idea was the Town idea.. sad that it wasn't and it should be implemented. 
---
Everyone's worried about duping and bugs and I'm still stuck on, "Why can't I have a sleepover at my CAMP with the bunk beds?" 
---
Add the budgets together.. something.. 
---
this happened to me last week as well.... just went back and sever hopped for a few hours going to the spawn locations to get what I needed 
---
Yeah seems more work, so if I check before hand, is it server based. Somebody asked a question, if somebody went there while you clearing out the silo, and the enemies change, then what .. potentially you could have liberators or molemen, so it has to be a hit or miss right.
---
I followed someone's advice on reddit and hit Arknos .. bad idea, waste of a nuke.
---
I got them doing Leader of the Pack
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Event:+Leader+of+the+Pack
---
The lore of having your base destroyed by a griefer is the core game mechanic to think about here. There is nowhere to settle in the game where you have security, the only consequence against that player choice is necessitated by player retaliation / prevention. Thus, TOWNS.
---
No, fresh water shrimp are fresh water shrimp. Crayfish are more like small fresh water lobsters.
---
A player once dropped like 20 each of Nuka Orange and Nuka Wild for me.
---
You're talking about enjoying other people's strife. Literally makes you worse than those "trolls" participating. If you had a sense of what is morally right. You would not allow it and you would fight on the side of logic and kindness.
---
Yeah I don't hit WhiteSpring, I will let others hit it, I am up for different sites, somebody hit Camden the other day, didn't make it out there, but would of been interesting a little, probably just higher level scorch.
---
I kept nuking it during christmas to welcome the newbies and I found that it was a really awesome place to farm ghouls.
---
Yes i do i have all the perks linked to shotguns 
---
 *Reddit is being regularly manipulated by large financial services companies with fake accounts and fake upvotes via seemingly ordinary internet marketing agencies.*

---
Was it gathered/made all at once (or close to it)? If so, it'll spoil all at once. A long fast travel can also spoil across a good chunk of time.
---
The spoilage rates do need to be dealt with tho' - you'll spoil collected food simply fast traveling back to camp to cook it. It also makes it *very* difficult to collect the ingredients for the more complex recipes; which makes one of the more complex systems of the game almost totally useless.
---
At the very, absolute *least*, we should be able to keep food longer/indefinitely if we have a wired refrigerator at our camp.
---
Also if you have those pointy half wall things. They look like they‚Äôre supported by the wall under them but sometimes it‚Äôs actually the floor. Hell if I know why but that‚Äôs usually the culprit for me. 
---
Yeah I hate the scrapping, I accidentally scrapped an ultracite helmet. Still using an excavator helmet as a substitute.
---
Oh just watched his video about the airport, that's just stupid advice, sorry but even high level scorch drop hardened mass and worth the XP .. probably not that terrible from a glowing one I suspect ..
---
I definitely will hit the airport .. he repeated like 5 times not to hit the airport .. terrible advice ..  
---
I only went up with the 3 damage perks at 10%. To save on space and max damage. Still got to 930 on the double, 1313 on my combat. 
---
I cant believe you people, you should be as mythical as dragons yet you're not, how do you form such illogical opinions, the post is literally comparing item duplication in a videogame with no effect on real life monetary gain to real life theft like they're equal crimes, if I pay for a game i'm entitled to everything it entails, exploiting gross developer incompetence is different from real life theft and hacking/cheating, you should be directing this passion towards bethesda in an effort to get them to try and fix the game instead of arguing with a random player. Its bethesda that fucked the game up for you, not the other players. You dont buy a license to play a game either, thats just stupid, licenses are there to add barriers to things that are dangerous and may cause harm to others so that only those that are proven responsible enough can have one for example you need a license to own a gun.
---
It is not ammusing. Open your eyes man. Ffs
---
But surely not during the nuke event, I get it spawns ghouls, but I am not following that damn robot around while everyone is killing the glowing ones lol
---
Last time i did Uranium Fever, there were over 10 randoms there who could 1shot everything. When a legendary spawned, everyone wipped out low dmg weapon just to tag it, let people run over etc.
---
Sometimes you encounter dicks, other times you encounter friendly people. :)
---
Hey for future reference keep posting on reddit. Some of us don‚Äôt use discord.  Thanks!
---
As in yucky misogyny, or as in their own social anxiety needing to (heaven forbid) interact with a woman? 
---
You can get collision course a few times. 
---
Oh nice ya i have them all maxed i dedicate alto to my damage output then wing the rest of it 
---
Nah not really, it's a good alternative, no douche spawning camps etc .. but it spawns no legendaries, so if you just after XP and Flora, MorganTown is a good alternative.
---
Yea the fallout community hates pvp. They dont wanna risk anything they work for (most of them
---
Never touched an mmo in their lives) so anything supporting pvp is shutdown.
---
i have a similar problem.  i play on a sanyo 60" LCD.  it runs at 60hz refresh.  vid card is a gtx1060.  CPU i7 4790.  12 gigs on board RAM, plus what is on the vid card.  i get A LOT of moments where my FPS drops from 62 to 10 for a few seconds.  enough to cause a stutter in my game play.  this happens when i turn my character.  i is almost like the game is trying to render the landscape from scratch.  it is not already loaded in RAM.  or is it because my refresh rate is 60?  or that i am being forced to 30 by FO76?  i have lowered my graphics settings to low, and problem still persists.  i can play on ultra, and it is just the same as low, performance wise.
---
Gathered and made all at once i fast travel or sleep or login and its gone. I know for a fact its sleeping and fast traveling not sure about reloging
---
Which, WhiteSpring ?
---
Id say otherwise, after awhile it gets fcking annoying 
---
Just leave it up :). Mine is far enough off the beaten path that it doesn‚Äôt get too dinged up while I‚Äôm gone. Additionally, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll show on your map as home unless you leave your structures in place. 
---
YES PLEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEEEEE
---
What damage numbers?
---
More loot for me? This community isnt competitive enough lmao
---
How is watching someone fail at intimidation and trolling not amusing?
---
Happened to me but with a beserker fat man 1200 damage he was wanted not even a scratch. After I hit him he just came up and tried to trade.
---
Dim orange has such a nice warm feel to it
---
I don't know, the same way watching a blind person struggle shouldn't be ammusing.
---
That's completely different. Stupidity is a choice.
---
Damn, that's even worse.
---
I‚Äôd definitely prefer the items you suggested
---
And a pack of cigarettes you just picked up outside üòÇ
---
The camp icon will show even if you only have the CAMP device places. Structures are not required.
---
I've done it at least twice to full completion, but you're right there is a visual glitch that often hits.
---
They've already said there will be private modable servers. Last mention was that they'd be released at least a year post-launch, which is fairly normal.
---
No talk of how they'd be monetized yet though. 
---
Interesting question. I have no answer. Sorry.
---
I know. I don't really care about any of that, I just wanted to troll you.
---
Am I total idiot if I ask what TSE is? And I'll have to check to see if the receiver I can do is auto or not. I have started on the adrenaline perk. I've got about 20 perk points saved üòä so I'll see about maxing it out. I'll have to give my crossbow a test run and let u know how I like it. 
---
It ate 900 .308 and two pieces of PA for me. Now I make sure I kill mobs and take my time. Getting hit is what causes the inventory jumble. Still needs fixed
---
I usually camp at the pond west of there, right under the snake image on the map. A behemoth has spawned there at least five times, but only when I‚Äôve fast traveled to the camp. 
---
Scorchbeasts, too, but about twice as often. Worst part about the SB is even if I leave it‚Äôs still there when I come back, and the robots usually don‚Äôt attack it.
---
See I thought that too but I thought I was doing shit damage, but she kept charging and screeching at me the whole time.
---
I have learnt the dense mod for combat chest piece I can mod it for you if you want. it is awesome with TSE weapons Gt vespaboy1975
---
Just found a few Cryo guns today, maybe I'll keep one! Thank you for the advice. I've only hunted the queen 2-3 times.
---
It would work better if it bothered me ü§∑
---
Must....get.....mothman pop!!
---
Honestly the issues us when you visiting the zone is what spawns the new mobs so everyone camping the cell gets to kill everyone while you're loading in.
---
Just bash the legendaries, if you have TSE.
---
I'm also missing 2 pieces of my ultracite power armor. really not sure how that happened.
---
Lol. Come here again after you killed and your junks stolen.
---
The guy who set off the nuke to activate the queen got disconnected right before she died. Felt bad
---
I personally like to make a minimalistic camp, just a platform and missile turrets. If you put it outside of Whitespring, and I mean right against that golf club building window, you can get TONS of legendaries, stealing spawns from the random dumbasses that spawn there trying to farm! You don't even have to be there. Just return periodically to scrape up those rewards!
---
Y'all'dve
---
It should spawn more enemies. It shouldn‚Äôt be that crowded up there. 
---
I'll buy a tse handmade if you have one
---
Oh, it bothers you. I can tell. Otherwise you wouldn't be arguing with me.
---
I find this far funnier than I should. 
---
But shell casings to the face are what make the furious perk work cause science üòÜ
---
Hmmmmmphhh uhhhh ahhhh ughhhh uhhhh ahhhhhjhhhhh
---
That or I enjoy arguing 
---
Dear lord. Who still plays a game if they can't open up the menu seconds after loading in? Just stop. Stop showing these companies that they can get away with shipping an unfinished product. I'm not saying there aren't good things about the game but come on. This is ridiculous. If you have to fight a game like this just to get a halfway good experience then it's not worth it. 
---
It's an inherent problem in today's society. People just dont take responsibility for their bad behavior anymore. It's always someone else's fault.
---
Right .. probably worth doing once you done with the glowing ones
---
That's cool as 
---
I see you making pretty big allegations then ignoring people asking for you to elaborate, you don't seem very trustworthy. Like how we're they racist? Hell how did they know your race? 
---
"My game is broke"
---
-Bethesda starts shooting out racist remarks-
---
I'm willing to bet that's bullshit.
---
talk about identity crisis...
---
Good point
---
I shot the sheriff
---
But I didn‚Äôt shoot the deputy. 
---
Gotcha, thanks.  I do like coming ‚Äúhome,‚Äù though. :)
---
I think the whole settling down in one place thing is not ideal, and in a PvP server CAMPs will be much more mobile, being placed nearby all the time, with few items and everything stored unless necessary.
---
The devs probably wanted to show more of the moving bits as eye candy
---
yeah...it's a weird moment walking against air only to realize there's a unloaded wall instead
---
Like shadowed and sleek, rolled into one with the weight reduction of ultra light.

Legally it's more similar to an attractive nuisance, where the owner  of the nuisance is legally liable for ensuing trouble.
---
You can smelt it with acid at a chemistry station to make scrap. 
---
Chem table. Smelting. Use acid to turn it into scrap materials.
---
I just saw that tower yesterday! It was so nice and bittersweet once you understood the situation. Definitely made me wish we had planters like that.
---
I found if I load in and i am getting hit and dont see anything I just start swinging my melee swing in a circle and I start getting xp. After game loads corpses will be in front of me to loot. Also I'm on xbox 1x I haven't loaded in dead yet I'm wondering if the people that die before they load are on just a xbox 1?
---
"oh you logged out in power armor? What a hypocrite, like you're any different than people who intentionally crash servers to duplicate items in Mass and ruin the games economy"
---
I don't even use power armor but let's not pretend those are even similar. 
---
Radiation counts as damage.
---
Instead we are getting a brand ‚Äúnew‚Äù pvp mode.
---
The other day I loaded and got the message saying my camp wasn‚Äôt placed. Immediately after hitting OK I got another message saying server unresponsive and I was kicked.
---
That sucks. Reload.
---
My camp is placed near the pond at Whitesprings. On load I‚Äôm in the water, but there‚Äôs no water, just fish flying in air. I turn and step out of the ‚Äúwater‚Äù and see no camp. Then the controls lock. My camp is slowly spawning one wall at a time. And my health is draining. Still can‚Äôt move. Water spawns. Eventually I die, and *then* the mirelurks appear. Go to respawn, but there are no available icons on the travel screen. I‚Äôm stuck in limbo.
---
This really sucks. Reload.
---
Load, check. Camp, check. Can move, check. No mirelurks, check. Cool. Go into camp to do some crafting. The moment the front door opens the server crashes again.
---
Close Fallout, load Cube 2 (free game on xBox Gold this month). Was actually a very fun puzzle game. Didn‚Äôt crash at all. Would recommend.
---
Not everything can be deal with melee like I load in with 2 scorch beast attack me once and nothing on my screen .-.
---
I wasn‚Äôt getting hit at the time though? I‚Äôd already cleared the area and had just finished off a wave of liberators. I didn‚Äôt see any damage indicators or feel my controller rumble
---
Def this
---
They forgot to finish the game, when they released it.
---
Worked for me and thank you for the tip.
---
If you move camp though it won't place the blueprint, I think because it considers the second set of stairs as floating.
---
Lame, for now.
---
Will probably be patched, I hope.
---
Have you repaired the consoles on top of the roof? 
---
This. I don‚Äôt want to go looking for some random guy to craft me a mod every time I get the next bigger better Penetrating Pants of Power or whatever.
---
You haven't seen MagikarpUsedFly's recent video, have you? Kinda word for word bud.
---
https://youtu.be/aYNwRogs5SY
---
If you abuse the spawns too hard you get robots as punishment. Did this soooooo many times on so many servers pre BloGlo exp nerf.
---
Strange. As far as I knew it only jumbles at being hit. 
---
Yup
---
Sounds like old man rant. I approve
---
Stop trying to confuse us with your facts!
---
Yup. 
---
Full completion IS possible, but for some reason some of the pipes still get tagged for repair even after they are repaired. There are additional units to repair on the roof, including a console on the OUTSIDE of one of the steam towers. It's located at the end of a catwalk that runs up to the tower, but doesn't give access to the tower. 
---
Best part...I had nothing to do with it. Completely random server that I jumped on.
---
I‚Äôm more triggered when someone with pacifist contests.
---
Mhmm
---
Oh for real, I know. Didnt think about those most of the time the spots I get attack like that is loading whitesprings. Was just trying to help people with a solution for things like that till it's fixed but it wont work for everything.
---
Someone mentioned it's a reference to the show Supernatural
---
Dumb question: what is a dupe?
---
Maybe it just wasn‚Äôt showing markers. Or I might have been unlucky and had a colission if bugs. Yesterday when exiting the hall of mysteries via the shelters I started taking constant damage for no reason without any hit markers or monsters around. If I had that happen again perhaps the game decided that was a thing? Not sure. 
---
Like the others have been saying, get some acid and smelt them at a chem table. Honestly, iron ore is my main source for steel scrap. I just collect a metric fuck ton of acid and do every single breach and clear. Sometime's if I run low on the ores I'll go to the mines or even use workshops.
---
I‚Äôve seen one standing by whitespring train station. Lvl 68 Epic Behemoth
---
Unsure if it's related to bobbles heads, but I've seen it and personally had it happen. Was not at a workshop, no armor mods or anything that would do unwanted damage, my teammate never fired a shot. Guy hits me with melee twice, give him the thumbs down. Guy goes into inventory walks up and oneshots me. So whatever it is, let's no down play that there's currently a glitch allowing people to ignore slap damage. Just because it doesn't happen often and there's no proof to how it happens doesn't mean it's fake news.
---
Ignore Mr raider, even when you lose all your junk there's ten more people that would gladly give you some or help you grind some out. 
---
Your post basically just described why Facebook sucks and hasn't upgraded to 4K yet.
---
Both sleeping and fast traveling (but especially the latter) take in-game time - time that's applied to the spoilage rate of food. You can track this with the PipBoy clock. I'm not sure how much time, but the more distance fast-traveled, the more time passes. I've never experimented with it, but may do so tomorrow...
---
Again, the fact that the food was made at the same time means that it will spoil at the same time - all gone in a "poof!" Spoilage rates for most food is *really* aggressive as well. Cooked food lasts longer than  Rarer, heavier food like Scorchbeast or Deathclaw meats last much longer, but common vegetables/meat are like ice cubes in August.
---
Remember also that pre-war food and plain water *never* spoils - it's worth grabbing for this fact alone.
---
I just cancel it by jumping as soon as I land.
---
Second Hand Object Purchase Service? 
---
Cruel cruel world... nice shot.
---
Sometimes I randomly"get hit" out of nowhere with nothing in sight. Could very well be one of those.
---
Maybe go for someone less new
---
Store at Home Object Placement System. 
---
What a delightful array of bugs xD 
---
Well it wasn‚Äôt as extensive as I was hoping to see.  Mostly some trashed crops.  Guessing trying to pick the lock on my extractor Keyed him as attacking.  Totally forgot to unlock it anyhow, drowning in nuke waste.  
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 bring the rage, I‚Äôll gladly put you down
---
Had this happen while messing up a silo run a couple times solo on the repair part when I was over encumbered and couldn't move quick enough to repair them all. 
---
I load in whitespring once w/o PA and it was nuke zone so I got 2 load screen and when the loading finally done my character is dead on the floor with max rad damage
---
That was never a thing.
---
That is cold. And funny. But cold. I'm sure he thought it was funny. Or mean. Hahaha I laughed. But then I felt bad. So many things.
---
Can I just get a single player mode then if people are gonna freak about exploiting in a bethesda game
---
Not at all, TSE stand for Two Shot Exploding. It's a powerful combo of legendary weapon effects
---
You always lose caps if you die in pvp.
---
Workshops are an invitation to pvp
---
didnt think you could scrap things in the stash other than mods without taking it out
---
Special Human Operated Public Stores
---
You only need about 300 lead to get your ammo back? :(
---
Make sure you blueprint it if you leave it. 
---
You're making this up.
---
My friend and I had a base once and it used to spawn all the time, it does not drop anything good tho
---
Yes I have
---
I don't know who that is so no.
---
I think each time you die in PVP you loose some caps, and with the workshop you do open your self up to PVP.  However, its not quite like you said...
---
You pay your 25 caps or whatever to setup the workshop...  Its now yours and you can setup your stuff.  Anybody can come and go and some may even show up and help on an defense event.   If they attack you or your stuff, or pick a lock, they become wanted.   
---
However, anybody can go up to the workshop and pay caps to take it over.  If they do, then its game on immediately.  
---
As soon as they pay their caps they can fight you, but they also have to stay close enough to the workshop to take it over, which takes time.   Even if you are killed, the workshop is not theirs until they stand there long enough which means you can counter attack.  You kill them, they kill you, and so on until one or the other holds on the workshop long enough to fully take it over and/or someone gives up.
---
Defense? 
---
1 Deny them the workshop via building.  Lock doors, put up walls, and so on.   If they have to destroy or pick a lock to get to the workshop they become wanted, which is cost they might not want to take on.
---
2. Turrets.  As soon as they pay their caps they are hostile, so have some turrets ready to pummel them as soon as they pay their contest fee. Even if they are not powerful, they can serve as distraction/warning.  
---
It's kinda stupid
---
Going to make the new mode basically bullshit unless you run this armor build
---
I've got 15 and I think I somewhat see a difference but 90% of it is still trash. This is weird considering luck should definitely increase your chances for good RNG.
---
I just wanted to see how it felt, ngl I felt bad, but also I couldn't stop laughing about his corpse and how it fell. If decide to try this again I will go for someone a bit more experienced. 
---
i killed a flatwoods monster in whitesprings after it was nuked.seemed to die pretty quickly..i was only using a vampires ski sword too
---
That's very clever.
---
I hope the griefers will give you a pass.
---
(But I predict, sadly, that they won't. Just remember that someone at Bethesda made a deliberate decision to enable PvP damage even to pacifist players' CAMPs. I want to know who that person was, so I can go leave a load in the punchbowl at his/her wedding.)
---
&gt;if you picture the idea of a vault  dweller fresh from the vault, with 10 mutations and think it's normal,  
---
Forget about being a vault dweller for a second, and just picture it as someone from West Virginia with 10 mutations, and it seems much more normal.
---
My feelings exactly!
---
Cool as what
---
Seems like that would cut down on who you encounter out there. Both the good and bad. I'm not sure that's where the devs are taking this game. Maybe something like this could come with private servers though. Create a TOWNS server for you and your friends to populate and invite other friends to visit. I don't see this going well with the public servers and the "meet everyone" kind of thing they seem to want going on there.
---
Post pics of it, you seem to be the only one on the Internet who's gotten anything other than Heavy Barrel
---
Yeah, the Flatwoods monster can sometimes teleport and regain all its health. It's like a Bloodbug, really weak but can regenerate health quickly from its opponents. It's not very rewarding when you do kill it, you get bragging rights I guess.
---
Probably could've got him in one if my gatling gun was accurate lol
---
Thanks all!
---
Completely understandable. But you should still feel kinda bad. But laugh too.
---
That's actually a great gun for someone fresh out of the vault.  Likely they'll have little to no DR.  Personally, I'd save it, kit it out completely with aligned mods, a drum mag, suppressor and glow sights and give it to the first &gt;10lvl player I  see on the map.
---
the answer is yes, full health is always 0% radiated - the builds for low health most easily utilize the new buff to the RAD bar as of the Jan 10 patch, which keeps yo approx 76% radiated after death rather than clearing it some more each death.
---
yu can then stack adrenal reaction, nerd rage, bloodied effect, unyielding armor, and radicool for melee weapon
---
as you are not at full health, you can't be instigated.. but you're probably gonna die without it, period. getting hit at all is the weak spot for rage /bloodied builds
---
What gun did you use 
---
lol energy weapons.
---
I did, and I am haha
---
They were most likely glitches into the map. 
---
Just non tse gatling gun 
---
Commendably pithy. Sadly accurate.
---
Had that happen once with camden fuzzy tokens. The event was up but got disconnected before doing it. Came back and it's gone for the day.
---
No offence or anything. I dont want to take a stand in this so. But who do u think would impact the game more. The ones now not playing until duped items are removed or the amount of players that would leave if duped items are removed
---
So a regular gatling gun 
---
You're still human. Not like Frank Horrigan at all.
---
I know and remember this when I log in but always succumb to temptation and have to waste a few more minutes reloading the game. 
---
Don‚Äôt open the pip boy...don‚Äôt open the pip boy...don‚Äôt open the pip boy...ooh I wonder if I need to eat or drink/do I have my vendor run perks on/how much junk do I have on me...ahh crap that was a dumb decision. Next time I‚Äôll be smarter...
---
It just hit me 
---
Lead is just such a huge pain to get though. Most sources I can get to with relative ease are bare, and lead seems to rarely pop up in shops. I could technically find a workshop, but then I‚Äôd also need the acid to refine it. It‚Äôs more of a ball ache than anything and really sets me back. Means I‚Äôm without my maid weapon, it had great power, fire speed and ammo capacity. So I will either need a weaker pipe rifle with a drum, where I have the ammo and fire rate but not the power. Or make another hunting rifle so I have the power but not the fire speed or ammo capacity. Just slows things down. And is a huge waste of resources.

Garrahan Mining Headquarters Lower Floor Car-park. Bugs.
---
Unable to enter armour. Screen froze but was able to open map. Armour is not able to be recalled but recalls automatically after 60 seconds. Tested twice with same result.
---
Unable to pick up any items in car-park area - no option to do so. Picked lock to get into cage area but unable to pick up any items in there either. I was wearing T-60, not Excavator Armour. Don't know if this related to bug.
---
It's legendary but nothing major other than a crippling effect 
---
I posted a fairly controversial viewpoint about feminism the other day (that it is good), and initially I got -63... but then I went back a day later and all these people had seen the exchange since then, and it had reversed and gone up to like +187. 
---
I feel like the Reddit system really does provide a way for genuinely good posts to get shuffled to more and more visibility. So even an initial negative reaction can turn around, if you post an actual good comment or post.
---
My current worn armor is horrible compared to x01 so I'm always in my power armor so haven't had that happen but could see it for sure when I load nuke zones I'm around 40 to 50% rads with power armor on.
---
Its a different scale but Star Wars Galaxies did this very well. 
---
Nice that would probably be pretty good for stuff like that with crippling 
---
I used the infinite weight glitch because it meant that I‚Äôd no longer have to spend 50% of my play time managing my inventory.  I don‚Äôt know how people can find it fun managing your inventory every 30 minutes. Using this post‚Äôs logic I will say that maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have to steal from the store if they just lowered their prices.
---
Yeah, they have a system that automatically updates in-game events like Child's Play and the Atom shop that's going to run for the next few months while most of the team is working on Bug Fixes and Balance issues for patches.  I myself am writing up a bunch of concepts but I'm saving them until this state the devs are in is over.
---
Yes, and call it Fortnite 76 and I'm happy.
---
We get it for the XP but it would be cool to have the sounds to match that go with striking bots.
---
Sounds like its time for Bethesda to actually make a multiplayer fallout title.
---
You can set your camp on a lead vein, the extractor gives you lead scrap not ore. Tagging lead for search helps too. You'd be surprised the amount of crap with lead in it. Go to sugar Grove there's a shelf with about 16 pencils on it too. Right now I switch between auto handmade and 10mm smg and it's been awhile since I've worried about ammo
---
It's got double ammo capacity and with the large drum it holds 750 before having to reload, I love it.
---
That's a good weapon 
---
Duplicating/making multiple copies of items through an exploit. Most them are duping then selling them on Ebay.
---
Odd logic is that you can scrap the landing. Worse is you can't put it back because the stairs are in the way 
---
What system are you on?
---
Iron can be combined with Acid at a chemistry workbench to produce Steel scrap while Silver can be combined with Acid to produce Silver scrap.
---
Well that's just pleasant conversation, cause I enjoy it too!
---
Can I get some Serum Recipes please ?

Oh okay , that makes more sense. I was thinking maybe the health regain was a bug, but about five whole health regains? That's a little too excessive to be a bug lol. This makes more sense, thanks
---
Play Freebird
---
It has served me well
---
Ida and ??   I have encountered them in two different places ! 
---
When are you guys -EVER- going to fix your challenges eg. Killing Cryptids, etc. Killed a Mothman which is already rare enough and it didn't unlock and reward the Atoms appropriately. Some stats even reset eg. Killing Legendary Creatures (!). And you dare to focus your attention on a new -MODE-?
---
Prioritize your shit together, Bethesda!
---
Yeah that was a lucky drop also do you think raiding is fun I might get into it 
---
But we're agreeing right now, so the conversation is getting boring
---
And I‚Äôve heard of ppl game crashed and character didn‚Äôt get logged out died after lost all the junk 
---
Think of meeeee
---
the printing alone would probably take 10+ years lul
---
So y'all think all raiders are big evil baddies?
---
At low levels, it's unlikely that you will have the plans for the things that the griefers most like to wreck, and what you *can* build is cheap to repair (compared to things like fusion generators and decontamination arches).
---
If you enjoy the aesthetic challenge of creating something new and unique to you that expresses your whims and personality, you can invest time and, eventually, resources in building a neat CAMP, which you can show off to passers-by.
---
If you're focused solely on in-game efficiency, then instead you think about things like: Do I have all the workbenches I need? Am I placed near the resources I need to collect regularly (e.g., steel &amp; lead for ammo)? Am I placing my camp somewhere that will maximize the value of the caps-free fast travel back to it, so that it (and Vault 76) can minimize my caps expenditures?
---
There's no wrong way. There are a thousand different ways, which you'll come across in-game and read about here. Whether it's the right way depends on your preferences. But if you do invest time and trouble in your camp, be prepared for frustration over the bugs and quirks you'll have to work around. 
---
And accept the fact, regardless, that someone *will* destroy your camp sometime just because they can, and because someone at Bethesda thought it would be funny to let them.
---
The Website just says February sadly, no specific days. I'm still looking forward to adding the Radtoad and Mothman to my Fallout pops collection!
---
What parts are you having trouble finding for your excavator PA? 
---
Springs were hard for me at the time, I can give you some tips on those if you need. Or if you are on PC, I can help you get stuff tomorrow night.
---
You mean the Humble Overseers Advice
---
the other person might be quite happy to have more spawns and more things to shoot.  It's a multi player game, expecting to have a quest site reserved just for you because you're in it already isn't realistic.
---
I found it! It was on the engine of a Jet Ski almost straight East and a hair south of the Cabins. Look for the small crashed Tugboat.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the response!
---
If he was a bit more experienced, I think it would have been more fun for me (and probably him), but I could see myself having fun in the future doing it.
---
The Senior Knight rank is used by Taggerdy's chapter, mostly to differentiate between her command staff (i.e. Senior Knight Ted Wilson outranked Knights Johnny Moreno and "Tex" Rogers).
---
Haven't peoppe been selling duped iteams for real money though?
---
I'd say they gain something pretty tangible.
---
I might have to try it I have a good weapon for it an explosive assassins combat shotgun 
---
Pencils are a godsend. And I always get happy when scorched drop lead pipes. I thought all refineries just mined ores now rather than actual scrap material? And I‚Äôm on Xbox xD
---
I use my handmade for general use and then my hunting rifle for ranged. With a shotgun for crippling beasties or when I‚Äôm being swarmed. 
---
I didn‚Äôt drop them in a bag. I had them all placed inside my CAMP. I was banking on the fact that they would all reappear, as they are supposed to just recall into my inventory automatically, but no luck. 
---
No thank you. They should buff crafting. Legendaries pretty much made it pointless to invest in intelligence other than demo perk.
---
I had the same issue on my C.A.M.P. I basically had to scrap/store everything I could, move to a different spot, then scrap/store the objects that couldn‚Äôt be removed, move back, and start all over. Thanks for helping me waste 2 hours Bethesda!
---
Why downvote 
---
And yet...
---
Yes.
---
You realize there's a whole other open world game with lots of horses right?
---
I'm just saying the lack of horses is in no way detrimental to my enjoyment of fallout76.
---
Nice, I have a few tse weapons, but I didn't want his first death to be at the barrel of something that op haha
---
What system?
---
I appreciate the reply! I do understand the mechanics of workshops. The fact that it's an invitation for PvP makes the loss of caps make sense. What I'm curious about the most is where the quantity of caps lost comes from. Considering I didn't even deal damage to the guy, losing 130 caps seems way too steep to simply be an arbitrary arbitrary amount, right?
---
I guess your right
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll buy it
---
I didn't even know I commented here 
---
Yeah that was nice of you 
---
I would help but you must of hand a stroke in the middle of that paragraph and it was to hard to comprehend.
---
Love it. Want it.
---
You can preorder most at gamestop. 
---
That makes enough sense, but what's determining the amount lost? 130 seems too high.
---
I PLACED them. They were all set up around me when I froze, and I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt go back into my inventory. I also didn‚Äôt understand why my game kept freezing when I was frantically trying to log back in and check. 
---
They clearly said they didnt want mounts as they dont want is to rush around this is also the reaksjon Moe ment speed buffa dont stack. :(
---
Isn't this an option at your camp projector thingy? To repair all.
---
I'm on PS4 or I'd help you out with some free ammo. I swap between handmade and 10mm smg for all distances and break out All rise for ammo conservation. 
---
That only repairs things that got completely destroyed
---
No, Grahm is set essential. 
---
&gt; Just return periodically to scrape up those rewards! 
---
And rebuild your turrets after they're destroyed by griefers.
---
Yeah, and if you are on PC and accidentally block a friend their answer is, Oh send out a rando team invite and get them to add your friend to the party so you can add them back.... They need a blocked players list on PC, stupid as shit, lazy as hell. Yeah, you design it where players do this as a form of griefing and tell me I have to do it to unblock someone. 
---
You got a better way of switching armor pieces? The only way I know what‚Äôs what is to lay them all out. I never had a problem until now. 
---
Ah, that‚Äôs right. Good catch there.
---
100% sure it's not the mask one. It has a thing in its mouth
---
They probably don't even have this flagged as a problem tbh. The system is working as intended... it's just a terrible system.
---
Definitely think out your build ahead of time and work towards it too.  It will save a lot of pain later.
---
How much ?
---
Great build, Even looks inviting!
---
Its tied to level iirc.
---
A bit of a kick in the pants the higher you get.
---
um, no... you know how glitchy the horses were in Skyrim and because Fallout 76 uses a completely different engine they can't just simply port them over, it's like trying to get the Fortnite map to render in Battlefield V, it just won't work out. Plus Horses don't fit the Fallout theme, I'd be happy with Vertibirds and maybe Trains but for me, Horses are a no-no
---
It's the soya milk I tell you, soy changes everything.
---
I dont think so. Honestly, a stimpack being about the size of your hand, and a missile is about the size of your whole arm. 
---
I was a kind and gentle murderer 
---
Yeah he had a couple seconds before he died and he didn't just get instakilled
---
Right? This game feels like a really lazy project. I wish producers would quit pushing projects to sell by holiday deadlines. I'd wish they'd just wait until a game was good before releasing it
---
Don't worry mods will take care of it lol.
---
Add bird bones and speed demon mutations in there too then group up with another person with mutations while having the Strange in numbers and squad maneuvers perks equipped for some over the top action. 
---
Then take some Rad-X to really understand what walking around really used to feel like. HOW DO PEOPLE LIVE LIKE THIS!!
---
Pretty much
---
You seem to be thinking of iguana bits.
---
Can confirm. This happened to me, too.
---
On XB.
---
The smg is a full auto right? I‚Äôm not using the auto rifle perks or it‚Äôs be tempting. I have about 1300 rounds of 10mm
---
Pfft. People always need
---
S I N G L E   A C T I O N   R E V O L V E R   I V O R Y   G R I P .
---
First shot let him know what was happening and the second shot put him to rest.
---
Not on Xbox. The game is unstable enough.
---
Accurate.
---
Ah that explains it then. A kick in the pants indeed!
---
The difference is you‚Äôre actually hurting someone when you steal in real life, whereas no one gives a shit about this crappy game and the items people are duping in it.
---
3 levels and it'll be useable though. 1 rank each 30% :p 9 levels and you can switch back and forth each outing
---
It‚Äôs when someone takes an item that they have and they multiply it by tens or hundreds or thousands. For example you have 5 stimpaks. If you ‚Äúdupe‚Äù those five stimpaks, you turn those 5 into 500.
---
There are a fuck ton of different creature variants. In Mongrels alone, there are the Diseased Mongrel, Glowing Mongrel, Glowing Diseased Mongrel, Vicious Mongrel, Albino Mongrel, Scorched Mongrel, Wild Mongrel, Feral Mongrel, and all of those types can be mix matched so there are 49 different variations of JUST MONGRELS ALONE
---
i dont know why they didnt make cosmetic "paper bags" in the atom store. like die and drop a small box with a bow with xmas wrapping for example. beth have been super incompetent with the atom shop with barely anything to buy and they wanted it to be the life blood of the game so dlc would be free for everyone...how is it gonna be free when no one is buying atoms because theres nothing worth spending them on.
---
Oh thanks
---
Yeah he so he had a couple seconds to react 
---
Honestly, I have defended them over and over. But due to server lag, trying to actually get a team going, I clicked the wrong thing and that was the "Official" solution given. Stolen from a Reddit post none the less. I said no, you guys have people griefing by accepting random team invites and then they destroy their camp. You can't be serious. You need to add a blocked players list. Then the support person gives me a link to make suggestions to the dev team lol. Like I need to make the suggestion of having a manageable friends list in 2019. 
---
Also you can get perfect storm, incendiary 10mm smg it's no tse but it's still fun and kills stuff haha
---
They should give you a detached retina, -3 Perception, but still inexplicably cured by a disease cure or waiting it out.
---
100% agree. It's hard for me to keep defending them when I'm constantly getting upset with things not getting fixed and more things getting broken
---
Just ignore all that and loose yourself in the terminals, personal stories and survival with limited resources. All the yellow dots on the map are simply things to avoid, warning symbols 'here there be dragons'.
---
i actually got one today at the "helmet" spawn in the white springs golf course locker room (where the red steamer trunk and wendigo spawn)  
---
normally I see other hats, so was shocked when it was there.
---
Yes, but player-to-player transactions don't add money into the system, it only moves it around. The money you get from NPC vendors conjures caps from nothing increasing the total caps present in the game. When the total ammount of a currency in a system rises significantly, the value of said currency usually declines. 
---
How did you get so many?
---
Once people make a big deal about sharing and being considerate about a thing... the assholes put a target on that thing.
---
Very informative! Thanks!
---
Well said, that is kind of what it's like, a sweaty dream, al jumbled up and illogical, with monsters and clowns.
---
Hey, you are me. Fuck I miss 80s Wasteland, walking into Vegas and seeing that Roboscorpion in the center of town,  failing at swimming, cloning myself. I too found it hard to get into Wasteland 2. I, too, am in love with FO76
---
I hope it's not raids like they do them in WoW. I want *story*
---
Why is that?
---
My planned build won‚Äôt have enough space for auto rifle perks, and I can‚Äôt affort to waste picks on it. But if I get them in perk packs then it might be a temporary option xD
---
new clever dick detected..
---
Hugging rad barrels to get one and have two perks maxed out in the luck tree. I forgot what the perks are called, sry, then server hop and hug barrels again
---
Imagine if you could nuke the vault
---
I want to see some one nuke vault 94

Ammunition, the currency of Death

What if that‚Äôs how we open the vaults ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
Yes. I have a shit connection. I'm playing on WiFi in Australia. 
---
However, I play dozens of online games and I literally NEVER disconnect in any of them, except for Fallout 76. Such coincidence, wow. 
---
Thanks. I appreciate that. 
---
Overreaching*
---
You can level up infinitely though. Being able to rifleman out to put commando in is worth it. I'm 108 with 3 Max rank rifleman, 3 Max rank commando and 3 rank 1 commando lol
---
Thx for everything man was cool

I tried to upvote 10 times and couldn't dammit but the thought was there.  Completely agree, some of the heavy guns in the game have serious drawbacks that prohibit every day use - weight, cost of ammo, or they break too fast.  Make it worth bringing those out for the SBQ.
---
This....this makes me insane everything I look at missing durability in my camp.
---
And I got fooled. 
---
Bethesda, one bad choice after another. It‚Äôs their thing.
---
This is why there‚Äôs stuff in them already because we just need to nuke them ü§îü§î
---
Yeah, tell me about it, everyone and their mother puts their C.A.M.P. at that spot.  /s
---
For real though. OCD kicks in and makes me want to ask a friend to destroy it so I can fix it
---
Honestly I remember when Call of Duty Modern Warfare multiplayer first came out and it was so much fun; runnin' and gunnin' and dodging snipers and yelling at campers lol. But by the next title there were so soooo many hackers. I really miss the times I played when there were no discernable hackers in the lobby. How can it be fun to sit there and not even have to aim, just click your mouse and kill everything? In that vein, how can it be fun to kill everything with a TSE and have everyone raging at you for doing it? People.
---
Went back and had another look, yep I‚Äôm a dumb arse
---
I had this happen with my megasloth named pickles.. As long as it's taking up budget it's alive. When pickles disappeared I found him guarding a random area or  sometimes glitched underground.
---
Found it
---
I bought Fallout in 1998 while I was in college.  I played Fallout 2, 3, NV, 4 and I'm having a 99% good time with 76.  There's always that one uncooperative dick every so often that either wants to grief you or take all the legendaries for themselves, but by and large it's been really fun.
---
I just recently started to acquire a couple good friends to group with, and it exponentially changes the experience for the better.  I completely see how Bethesda thought 76 would be a good idea, because it really is with 1-3 other players to share the wasteland with.  Even something as boring and tired as running around Watoga hunting for legendary robots is actually a fun and sometimes hilarious experience with friends.  The added side benefit of being able to share loot with people utilizing other builds makes farming 4x as effective and rewarding.
---
Personally, I like the mutations.  They're mostly quality of life related for me.  Having extra resistance and low health damage helps, but doesn't make me invincible.  A deathclaw or mob of ghouls can and will beat the hell out of me. even with the 5-6 mutations that I have and a TSE rifle.  (I can easily 1-2 shot kill myself with the TSE friendly fire, so it's not without a major disadvantage)
---
I agree that atomic shop has been very underwhelming.
---
If you play on PC, you're welcome to group up with my friends and I. We were hanging out with a lvl 15 guy that waved at us today for at least a couple hours helping him out with quests and general advice.  My in game name is Shankwell.
---
Take my upvote
---
I wasn't asking for bloodied build purposes... I was asking bc if the case is rad dmg stops instigating, I'll simply get slightly Iridiated and not have to worry about instigating at all....bloodied builds may be at the top end of pve builds..but are going to be horrible in pvp content when survival is released
---
Do your homework!
---
I noticed that too when I read the notes...I thought I was seeing things. Completely defeats the point of it IMO. Your character can be in both modes, anything you do in one carries to the other. 
---
I used to know a guy who was huge into board games (which I'm not). One in particular a lot of my other friends seemed to like, and I happened to be around at their game night, so I tried it out. At one point this guy legit tries to explain that in this game it's ok to cheat if nobody else notices. Like if you have some special card and you act like you are reading off it but instead you change it a little and do that instead, it's fine if no one else knows all the rules well enough to call you out.  Or if you're doing upkeep you can just nab an extra token, banking that no one is actually counting how many you take. I don't remember exactly but it was stuff like that.
---
I had never played before so I didn't object, but I thought "Wow, what? No. I'm just going to think you are a huge dick when you do that. What a great way to screw up a game."
---
I‚Äôm more worry about the lag and glitch .-. getting disconnected mid fight or SBQ glitched flew out of map
---
I find if you just melee him for a while it figures itself out.
---
Several people have probably all ready tried this and if it .worked we would probably all ready know about it
---
We can kill level 4s? 
---
Ya never know 
---
I can see my house from this photo! Also very accurate. 
---
I am just sincerely afraid of the literal monopolisation of the game market. Eventually the shops, hence the prices will be controlled by a set of powerful clans which will lead to the polarisation of the community. *Am I taking thjs too far?*
---
I‚Äôm level 24, so I‚Äôd quite like to get the essentials out the way first as I‚Äôm focusing on vats and critical banking etc xD
---
On PC I play with people on Discord, I have heard to many other players playing with people on discord but they look like crazy hermits walking around talking to themselves. 
---
True
---
I really miss the scaffolding set from fallout 4. 
---
We need more options with stairs. We have half walls; why not half stairs? Also, I wish those stair/floor/post combo pieces would stack. 
---
Also, the elevators from 4 would be neat. 
---
Apparently, I guess being wanted nullified being under lvl 5.
---
Rifle Gaming 
---
HAhahahaha that crash landing at the end omg
---
Also what happens when you nuke a normal fissure site I‚Äôve been wondering 
---
Happened to me a few days ago
---
I ran around for a while with 1 luck, and didn't find any good loots much.  Then, I leveled my luck up to like 9, and I got the G.A.S. Prize-Bot coming over to give me presents all the time.
---
Luck is very useful stat, get more items, get better items, get cool stuff.

An easy way to implement TOWNS would be to change the CAMP area from a Circle (more of a cylinder) to a Square, and allow CAMPs to snap together like floor tiles.  
---
This would allow players to snap their CAMPs together and create large TOWNS wherever they wanted.
---
In order to prevent a player being in your spot, they could lay out a grid over the map that lets you place your CAMP within the boxes.
---
I don't think anything happens you probably just get a few regular scorched beasts showing up
---
The towns only appearing to the first to log in will get annoying. More than likely you'll always be split up unless your squad up again. Also TOWNS should be for 8 players. So you have at least a small village going on.
---
I dunno maybe just some higher lvl ones 
---
As long as its like the protectatron from Primm
---
Thanks.... LMAO, I hadn't noticed this before, but I am sure it is all I will ever hear! 
---
Wrong game my friend. Stop expecting a rpg man you'll only be disappointed.
---
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
---
I got one of those once and ran it right up to Vault 76 and put it on the corpse
---
To be fair, there are games with official rules like that, but straight up ganking extra tokens seems beyond that. Its a fine line and makes the rules funky.
---
Ahhh you've got a way to go before you pick up flexibility extra perks. Pick up a 10 mm smg sometime and use it perkless in lower level areas for fun. Having something automatic for tagging mobs in nuke zones is good too
---
I run a simple level 50 two shot prime gatling with eight ranks of heavy weapons, martial artist 3 (for fire rate), stabilized 3, bloody mess 3, and one gun army 3, and it wrecks SB and the SB Queen, especially when they are on the ground. Of course, explosive would do a lot more damage, but I prefer non-explosive so I can kill all the adds attacking me without killing myself. Any gatling, explosive or not, will do the job just fine. At 200% repair, it lasts just long enough for the fight. But just in case I wear a hazmat so I can jump out of PA and  repair it mid-fight if needed. I can't comment on the Gatling Plasma, never had one worth using. But I've used some before and durability is a problem. They'll break before the fight is over, even with 200% repair and luck of the draw 3.
---
lol It's driving me crazy, I don't wtf it is.
---
They said that the raid like content are going to be the Nuke zones. But vaults are gonna be more like dungeons.
---
To be honest, there isn't. Bethesda forced everyone to be effected by PvP, and you can only drop so many nukes. I still don't understand why you can't have a passive CAMP
---
How do you guys make it so it says Brotherhood next to your name?
---
I try that and I try running into him and jumping on him. Most the time if he's actually stuck and not going anywhere that doesn't seem to work for me

But its just a game, why are you so upset!  /s

Personally, as someone who plays pretty much exclusively solo and has used my mic a grand total of once in hundreds of hours of gameplay, if something like this was added, I would be many times more likely to seek out people to play with online. Once I was already playing with a handful of others, I would be MUCH more likely to increase the number of my encounters in the wasteland. Though I like waving at people and shooting them a thumbs up, maybe trading a couple items, and then going on our merry ways, I wouldn't exactly call that a satisfying encounter.
---
Yeah make it 30 seconds that dude gets stuck so often. I mean did they not test his paths?. I like doing his event for the funny messages but still lol.
---
Oh yeah I love the dialogue for those lol. I would definitely be okay with the 30 sec 
---
I haven't played in like a month how long has duping been going on?
---
The ts plasma will break most queen fights and when fired in long amounts is worse for frame rate than a tse Gatling, the tse gatling will last longer do more damage and isn‚Äôt overly bad for frame rate when used in medium bursts. It‚Äôs still personal preference but I would say the Gatling would be better for the long run
---
Most of my encounters on the game are great friendly regular ole folks. I truly believe the REEEE‚Äôers are a breed of neckbeards. The freak outs I get most are 1. Shock that I am a woman interested in video games  2. Shock that I am better than them at video games 3. Complete and total disappointment when my husband logs on and joins our team EVEN THOUGH I TELL EVERY REEEEEE UPFRONT THAT IM MARRIED.

A couple times, if I happen to be there already. You get a reward for completing the event even if you're not the owner. But I'm really careful not to damage anything due to the bounty risk.
---
As far as fast traveling, I don't even bother to defend my own workshops except for the first event that triggers right after you take it over.
---
I think I picked up the plans for them somewhere. Might be worth a look if it‚Äôs relatively lightweight. And yeah, no flexibility for me yet xD
---
Highly suggest watching the video for this one, they did a great reenactment of the holotapes and it's just really well done worth the time to watch.  [https://youtu.be/Uopr50jKGQ0](https://youtu.be/Uopr50jKGQ0) 
---
Platform? Run a repair, files could be damaged etc.
---
Pay it forward. Help out a player when you have the capacity. Makes the game a lot of fun. I give out weapons and excess meds all the time. 
---
Jerseyghost for his rare outfits vid. Almost all of them are kinda scummy and advertise for those account boosting sites now or either dupe themselves
---
I know. Plenty of times I've had to log to get it there. I actually like it more for the vegetation (stilt bean), fusion core, and yao guai/snallygaster spawn not to far. Junk pile is great and its easy to defend. Cheap fast travel is the cherry.
---
Craft a basic one, use all your 10mm , scrap it when you're out until you have another large pile of 10mm
---
there is a lot of hints that all vault 76 dwellers connected to simulation of after-war appalachia, so we don't have to think about lore in simulated world. Anything can happen here
---
This we will gladly hunt the aholes down that grief ya regardless so ignore that post. Plus ask anyone above level 50. They will gladly make you weapons, armor and give you aid if you need bro.
---
Treat others like you want to be treated serves well in this game and life.
---
If you were the guy I killed, you had a bounty on your head. Not really sure though, were you ever killed during the event by a guy in the enclave general clothes with a power fist?
---
Doing Atoms work.
---
Do you think I should put the link in the main post and mention the lore part?
---
Someone doing something you do not like IS NOT GRIEFING.
---
My crafted handmade does more damage than a tse against the queen. Tse is not great for sbq anyway 
---
except nobody has actually proved it though.
---
No fast travel mat?
---
I've never done a nuke zone and I hate Fallout 4 and 76's power armor. The UI is clunky and it just doesn't feel fun to be in. Does that mean I can never do nuke zones?
---
i wish you could use a (missile/40mm/mini nuke)), some springs, some steel and adhesive and make a IEDs out of them.
---
You're not doing a good job of arguing that you're not a dick.
---
Yes I believe so. I haven't seen any, but I think it would just show 999 for the first two shots and then count down.
---
Actually, I'm okay with the Brotherhood thing, once I got the full back story. No real reason they couldn't use an old satellite to communicate for awhile after the bombs fell. But yeah, the real explanation for both is that they had the asset and wanted to use it.
---
You don‚Äôt need a new character. I think it‚Äôs bugged for everyone. 
---
If you search the sub, there‚Äôs a bunch of threads on this. 
---
Hahah right.

Out of curiosity, do you guys use a console or PC?

He can be "killed" by a nuke, reduced to a pile of ash (not searchable).
---
I know that's right! I love the Unyielding wood armor. The goal is to deal damage, not take it, and there's no better stealth armor. I suppose it wouldn't hurt if they had a sturdy variety wired up with some strangler vines.
---
Anyhoo, stealth not working well for you? Slap on a piece of wooded armor with the shrouded mod and enjoy sneaking (quickly I might add)  straight up to a pack of super mutants in broad daylight while you slaughter them one by one, all without breaking cover.
---
I'm sure everyone would stare if I wore a short dress too... but I'm a big hairy dude.  
---
Still, valid point.  Much prefer we voice solutions that blathering incoherent analogies.  Although from Bethsoft standpoint I suppose the people selling in game items for real cash is actually tanamount to theft.
---
I believe they are just making use of the assets from FO4. Not sure i can say what the lore is because i thought they needed the mist. I would love a Q&amp;A from Bethesda on 76 each month or even a few answered each time they do inside the vault.
---
Got 100s of questions i would love yo ask them about the game. I really enjoy been able to do that with games like Warframe.
---
Now I'm glad I didn't click the link, haha.
---
I can get that. I do the same. The junkyard was kind of hard to tell what was what. I felt bad bad for causing damage but finished the quest. Just dumped the junk I got from it before I had another player kill me. Be cool to have the option to repair the damage.
---
Hahaha that's a very relatable feeling 
---
Meh, he always gets caught up in the wrong Ideas, lol I often find myself yelling at him in the video as if he can really hear me lol. 
---
I have thought that often too!  I wish we could somehow level up or max level the legendary as an crafting option.  
---
Having the game turn my X-01 Jetpack mod into 2mm EC rounds.
---
Have. Should have been. I didn't even read the wall of text because of this. 
---
Most likely they want many ppl to play the mode and not be a giant waste of time.
---
4% of ps4 players have killed 20 ppl. 
---
Simply put most ppl will not touch survival if they're forced to start over.
---
Does it happen to any of you?
---
Ah ok. Definitely planning on getting the Mothman and x-01. Thanks
---
I collect and hand out plans and recipes for the text chat community. I can tell you that number one most donated is the events and my most at one time was 101. With ivory in the 60s followed by the handy buzz blade around 47 at the highest.
---
I can tell by the placement That's my nuke. I dropped it about 3 hours ago on XB1. The placement perfectly matches mine. I wanted the raw flux North of Whitespring but could fast travel in to the super mutants waste dump. I checked prime but couldn't find Cobalt so I dropped my own.
---
Ok but did you send the ticket under canvas bag replacement or what because I been looking at ticket options and don't really see much options?
---
I wish we could leave gift boxes. 
---
I found a camp someone labeled Little Lamplight in neon letters. It had string lights and was a beautiful nod to fo3. I had just walked up to peek inside and I dont know if it was bad timing or my level scared them but they logged off and camp vanished. I didnt get to see much but I dont think anything could top it for me. 
---
Do keep in mind the usefulness the TSE offers when taking out the adds during a SBQ event.
---
OSHA? I don't think houses fall under occupational safety.
---
That's why you gotta be on the nosy HOA board
---
Don't mean to kill the buzz... But I'm on PS4 Neomod.
---
I use text chat mod to chat with the community and discord for the clan and mates. I don't and won't use in game voice and i see no need for it.
---
I wish they would allow the text chat to be an option in the game. I would also like them to allow the clan setup that the mod gives as well. Its too useful not to use.
---
If you defend it and the owner doesn't participate in the defense you take control of the workshop. Unless that's a bug and not a feature and I just happened to randomly gain control over extra workshops
---
Who's Antone? 
---
Yep they need raids for that late game grind, idk about 60 minutes worth of traveling though, that will soak up ammo and resources 
---
With all due respect, sir, we're not recruiting Wastelanders. We're recruiting the residents of Vault 76, one of the few vaults actually meant to repopulate America. These people were chosen for many of the same qualities we value in out operatives, and they've not been exposed to the mutating hellscape above. We might find some individuals of value here.
---
I would like log cabin style too
---
That doesn't mean fog crawlers didn't exist until Far Harbor (dlc) though. They may have evolved as soon as the bombs dropped, or earlier.
---
Lol I meant anyone
---
I have the same problem.  I know I picked it and it should be under Charisma but I can't find it.
---
I mean COME ON ü•¥
---
Cause the silos are so crowded. There are so many people writhing to launch a nuke. It like every time I'm on a server I have to wait cause alpha, bravo and Charlie already have team in there. Oh wait that's not it at all! You look around before you go in and see that there isn't a person in the silo until you get to start re building the mainframe cores and a bunch of lvl 52 gutsiest jump you on the workbench cause people decided to crash the party and while you're respawning they're launching the nuke that you just cleared for them. Yeah cool
---
Just to set the tone of this comment: I'm really enjoying 76 and the social Fallout experience it has delivered. 
---
That being said, I loved the previous Fallout games (3, NV and 4 for me) because of the decision making and, as some have stated in comments here, the struggle and having to make do with what you've got available. Playing with friends (and having access to everyone else playing via the Internet) can sort of off-set that, even inadvertently. If I'm looking for a X legendary pipe pistol and my buddy gets one in a drop and offers it to me, I'd be pretty hard-pressed to turn it down; it could be another 100 hours of playing until one drops for me. That mindset simply couldn't exist in previous games, as there was no other option than just getting it yourself. 
---
Now to what spurred me to reply to this comment originally: I think that if it had been characterized as a spin-off like you said, then the expectations would be different. As it stands, I'm totally unaware of when the next installment of Fallout is coming and have no idea if Bethesda is going to continually put out multiplayer games or if I can expect a return to "normalcy" in the future. If a traditional Fallout can be expected in a few years, then I think it'd be much easier for people to accept 76 for what it is. But if this is the new normal, I think many longtime players aren't going to be too interested in the next installment. 
---
As an aside, I'd really like to see a hybrid of the old single player games and 76's multiplayer In the form of co-op games. The world would be determined by whoever is hosting, and would reflect the decisions they've made in it. I think that if you took the single player games and added the co-op element to them, they could be rebooted with great success tomorrow. I also think that this would cause people to player even longer as they create worlds and make different decisions in each of their friends' worlds. I'm sure the technical logistics of this are enormous though. 
---
Ohhhh.  That's rough.
---
I was in a 4 person group yesterday and someone did it to the first supervisor with an explosive shotgun.  We were prepared to gang up on him and kill him instantly if he did it to the second, (I talked them down to giving him the benefit of the doubt until the second spawn, reminding them that we could likely get better lvl 45-50 legendaries with one loop of Watoga) but I think he sensed that we were all in a party after we all surrounded him in concert, guns drawn, and became a good sport after that by using an axe.  Maybe he got nervous when my more bloodthirsty pal followed his every move while demonstrating that he had an explosive Dragon.
---
yep that's part of the game.
---
Yeah this guy spent over 300k and got nothing but 1 star trash.

See you there!
---
There was a mod for Fallout 4 called Sim Settlements that gave NPC‚Äôs small buildings that they could eventually build up. This could be a good base to start for TOWNS (no pun intended). There could be plots to build a home with a specific area we can build in. 
---
most people do the rad "sick" emote then heart for mine
---
Placed a foundation, stairs up, floor, stairs down. Then you can attach floors in the foundation level!
---
I hid the stairs behind some walls with a bunch of generators, the windmill is basically cosmetic :-)
---
And it respawns on every login!
---
Thanks. I'll give my gatling a second look.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Explosive Vents don‚Äôt work at all, I have an X01 with EVs in both legs and they do nothing.

Only the evolved will inherit this new world. Your time in this world is over pitiful humans!!

Mutants are the way of the future!!

i think ya mist the point, asking, isn't expecting anything. sounds like just requestings a lil manners. but nobody has to oblige.
---
Crickets man, crickets...
---
If you ever play a spooky character, there's a junk pile nearby that's within range of the screams.
---
I've spent many a night there, playing a banjo by a camp fire, in my clown suit and sacrificial mask, surrounded by bone chimes, with the screams as my backing vocals. 
---
Dear god, they just can't stop digging the hole they're in deeper, can they? 
---
A campfire in the back right corner of the windmill lets you place it anywhere, then i used walls to hide it. You have like 1mm of clearance when placing it, took a bit of fiddling
---
Cayde-6*
---
Gotta respect the Ace, you know? 
---
Good to know.  Maybe that's why the plasma had been vendored.  I'm sure I can find a use for it outside of SBQ.
---
would love the option to have the BOS hood under the BOS helm
---
They still spawn here, most of the times they get stuck in a wall and can be taken out easily. I have a picture of a cricket with it's ass hanging out of a window :P
---
Yes'm
---
I will spell it correctly in the future
---
Did you ever sell this?
---
...or make them really crazy legendaries
---
I did not receive any refund yet, however it may be because I did not buy this piece of shit excuse of a game.
---
I actually ran into Graham my first time playing, in Flatwood. I had no idea how rare he was and just ignored him, not that I had any caps to spend.
---
Haven't moved in a while ...
---
1. Close to Whitesprings.  
---
2. Not only for the nuke drops and the runs to get supplies, but also for the (most of the time) added protective forces.  I used to build turrets and now just rather have the budget to do other stuff.  Rebuilding CAMP can be a pain, but after removing crops, its not been too bad
---
3. Water source
---
4. 2 different vendors close by plus a 3rd and 4th not too far away
---
5. Fair no. of people passing or dropping by and using the facilities. Only 2 negative incidents so far
---
With that said, I've seen some amazing CAMPs and it may be time for me to (try) get more advanced.
---
You lost me at "Thinking they're rude and unpleasant" They don't They don't even care if you think they are. Which makes their behavior untenable.
---
I don't have an alt account, maybe more than ONE PERSON on Reddit thought about it.
---
The only heavy guns worth running right now are the 50 cal and Gatling gun. I feel the whole weapon class needs a rework.
---
Yeah, I hear that a lot from the "super" muties. Generally just before "gurgle gurgle ach" and a whole lot of screaming. 
---
I stand corrected.
---
Assassin Sentinel gear exists.
---
  
---
PVP is dead garbage.
---
Yup there's a functioning / malfunctioning G.E.C.K. in Vault 94 still if you wallglitch into it
---
I use a Gatling plasma only because of how devastating I found it to against normal scorchbeasts, literally drains their health in seconds and does a good job on the queens health also 
---
Aw. You think that has any real impact on people lol. Poor little raider wannabe. 
---
I enjoy the towns ideas we have been seeing. I'd love such community oriented hubs and buildables for us to play with. But the only other thing I'd like to add beyond personal plots is letting the Mayor allow building rights to people to build in "public" lots that are included in the town.  A town isn't just a neighborhood of homes, it needs a couple lots that designated builder(s) can build in to make group builds. Like building a restaurant or cafe or shop or co-op food stands or hospital or jail/sheriff station.... whatever ppl would like making in these non-personal home lots.
---
Be prepare to crash a lot.
---
Please take your comments off of this sub Reddit then.
---
Yeah I set up a workshop, fast travelled to another, got that same black screen BS. I'm like F this game.
---
You can wallglitch into it with the power armor pretty easily. It's even valid dirt to put down your CAMP, I'm just too much of a chicken to build one inside :P
---
Lol why are you in this subreddit wasting your if you don‚Äôt have the game.
---
It‚Äôs a flair. Just select it on the right hand side of the subreddit.
---
I did not subscribe. It shows up in my feed when I sort by new. 
---
Because he‚Äôs desperate for attention.
---
Find a way to turn this into a dupe glitch and they‚Äôll have it patched immediately. Really sad how many bugs seem to go ignored or aren‚Äôt even acknowledged.
---
Armor is absolutely a thing if you try a little bit. It‚Äôs not as easy as slapping on PA but I personally find it way more satisfying to be able to take damage without hiding behind PA.
---
WE NEED A PRICE CHECK ON A WHITE SPRINGS JUMP SUIT AT REGISTER 5!
---
You can buy them from graham, if the 3 times I found him he always had the plans on him.
---
" ever encountered a **TSA** explosive person "
---
That was because of the Government Shutdown.
---
That sounds spooky AF. The shotgun creaks like an old ship... wonder if it‚Äôs related to where you found the weapon initially? 
---
I guess I'm confused.  
---
The queen fight is a separate Event from launching the nuke.  Killing her after a launch doesn't matter. (I think)  
---
I launched my first nuke tonight, but the queen event failed.  I have helped kill the queen before, so both are covered.  Am I missing something?
---
As for the pie, there's one on the roof of West-Tek at a little picnic spot.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect such analyses on this subreddit. 
---
oh i had seen that too.. maybe there is an issue going on too
---
If you actually tagged it you should get the loot regardless of if they finished it off. 
---
Normal houses usually don't have chemistry workbenches and stations where you can make giant suits of iron and steel from several hundred scissors and a roll of duct tape you found on a rotting corpse.
---
Good to know. I may keep the plasma on me for regular use. 
---
I didn't say one word about explosives. I said duping. Duping breaks the game in more ways than most people realize, not just with the proliferation of OP weapons. 
---
No, any legendary should work. I got promoted to general killing wolves at the county fair.
---
He‚Äôs garbage. His content used to be fun and interesting, but it‚Äôs all clickbait and Wikia trivia nowadays 
---
Yes
---
Wouldn't hurt, they did an amazing job of it. I've skimmed their other videos but this one I watched all of just because of that lore part. Really shows off how much they put into the game.
---
You‚Äôre lucky. After a couple months of dealing with all the crap they‚Äôve drenched their players in I finally had enough today after trashing 8 times in an hour while trying to waddle my way across the map because of the crap stash limits and being overweight.
---
Same. To be honest, I feel kind of bad getting nukes for killing ten wolves.
---
Fuck it, I‚Äôll upvote and take the downvotes. Bethesda has earned no slack and neither have those who defend this indefensible product. 
---
You killed Three Dogs?!
---
Dupers are shit people but Bethesda are just as shit considering they not only allowed the exploits to be in the game upon release, but they also took their time fixing things, lied about fixing some of the bugs and even took a few weeks off doing anything for the game using the ‚Äúit‚Äôs Christmas break‚Äù excuse.
---
I've in about last week seen lots of different places being hit besides WS and queen site.
---
Making a gun fully automatic reduces the AP cost by about 40%.
---
I say it a lot but these are the moments that make this game great. Hopefully Bethesda realizes it and keeps adding big events that bring players together and encourage teamwork.
---
It honestly isn't a moral argument imo. Its wrong but like the other guy said, wrong in the same way that downloading movies and music are.
---
The use of these dupes to hurt others or take money from others is where it becomes wrong. 
---
I have no problem with dupers if they did it for themselves to max and all that jazz. What that means to me is they cheated quickly through the game and missed a lot of the fun and have less to do than the rest of us. They can complain and be bored but its their own fault they ran out of stuff to do.
---
Now people dropping 50  Satellite 
---
lasers on camps deserved to be perma banned.
---
I love how it's the "ambi" part, not the "dexterous" part you couldn't get. xD
---
I've been playing for the same time on Xbox and saw them in December first. Now I can't find many high levels without one.
---
SuperDuper Home and Office Purchase System
---
Which is completely fucking retarded. Why have another category with the same characters? It's just a game mode at this point.
---
This isn‚Äôt new. Morgantown is where my friend and I would nuke when a server had too many high levels for us to want to do whitesprings and I‚Äôd see it get nuked every now and then by others. It was less used than whitesprings and less known about but it‚Äôs definitely not new.
---
In the ash heap he he floats into a coal seam fire and  gets stuck in a death loop forever.
---
TSE isn‚Äôt the have all end all. They‚Äôre not magically immortal. In fact they‚Äôre less likely to play really well in my experience. Any average sniper with a decent spec should be able to go toe to toe with them. 
---
Check out EvE online.
---
You might be able to corner the market is one system, or a branch of solar systems, but anyone can fly away and buy from elsewhere, or strap on a mining layer and collect materials themselves.  It requires strong arm tactics from ad hoc governments in low security space to enforce monopolies because the barrier of entry is so low 
---
Same with 76, but harder.  Yes, a hyper-motivated group of merchants could force high prices, but the price ceiling, as in EvE, is set by the effort it takes to go collect tin cans.  Eventually your artificially raised prices will be undercut by a hungry entrepreneur with time on their hands.
---
Yes, you could also build a mercenary force to go break kneecaps of those upstarts... but now you have to pay those players... and again, your wascally entrepreneur just needs to jump servers.
---
Economic Monopolies are never natural.  They come from collusion with some exterior force that can otherwise impose extra costs (broken kneecaps, tariffs, patents) to drive away competition.
---
76 does not currently provide the tools to allow such collusion to exist.  If anything, I bet we will find that the prices set by the faction robots are massively inflated.
---
It just sucks to spend all that time to find the keys, clear the silo, and launch a nuke to spawn a Queen then have the game crash. 
---
I tried lol
---
Oh god oh god if there was an enthusiasm mutation that would be me jumping up and down! 
---
You would have to select a frequency on your pip boy, so you could ignore it if you choose too 
---
That's more likely about them not wanting to constantly have to waste food repairing crops after critters/creatures damage them. A fence would suffice, of course.
---
Sweet! Because it matches my play style better than unyielding sentinel. 
---
I realize that now, but I wad just trying to expose more people to this nuke spot
---
I‚Äôm sure they wanted to take part in the fruits of their labor. I‚Äôd be pissed if I worked my ass off blasting my way through the silo just to have the game take away the loot and the thrill of watching other people run to the zone to help you clear out all the monsters. Shit like this is killing off what is left of the game and that hardcore server isn‚Äôt going to save it. It‚Äôs a shame because I really had high hopes for Fallout 76. 
---
Aren't they a quest reward? For free states line I got both arc trap and flame.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of broken features, systems etc that need fixing before this is looked at. The game is a hot mess. As annoying as this would be it shouldn‚Äôt be at the top of their priority list... if they even have one. Or even know what the word priority means.
---
Interesting, explains why when ive begun attacking the queen, before others show up, I've seen me doing quite large chunks of damage with my dragon
---
Just like you could opt out of world text chat.
---
But again, if you do tune in it would go about as well as global chat only with voice.
---
So it‚Äôs a hard pass for me.
---
Yea there are 8 of them 
---
Whaaa? Where did you find that :)
---
I like to play Zeta Invaders myself. 
---
I'm giving this post some thought, I'm working on a fast knife character, but full strength to use Vanguard armor if I can find enough pieces.
---
This is getting to be codename kids next door level of acronyms
---
It isn‚Äôt permanent. Move camp, scrap blueprint, move camp back to where it is now, rebuild. Fallout 76 is just a workaround simulator.
---
That‚Äôs nice and all but do everyone a favor and stay away from the SBQ until you‚Äôre more leveled. Having people there buffs her and if you can‚Äôt really contribute to the damage it can really be a struggle for the people trying to take her out. Not trying to be a dick just saying. Low levels hiding nearby can really take a tole. 
---
Or log out in power armor so you have some radiation resistance. 
---
PS4, Everything seems fine, it is just annoying I have to start all over by getting the id, repairing the reactor, ect. It disconnects at different parts of the quest.
---
Really? I was under the assumption they were random event stuff. I'll check it out then, thanks
---
PS4? I‚Äôll buy it

In watoga. I just keep the magazine finder perk under perception on and it led me straight to it.

Oh I agree, it does suck.  I apologize if my comment came off as snide, I've had plenty of my own problems with the game and feel lucky to have actually launched a nuke tonight without a glitch. 
---
Someone demonstrating a single instance of slap damage working as intended is not a demonstration that slap damage Always works as intended. C'mon this isn't that hard.
---
I, personally, did 2/3rds of someone's health with slap using a regular ass double barrel shotgun. He was something like half my level so the weird level scaling system probably comes into play, but it's definitely possible to kill someone through slap in just a few hits. 
---
Just log out in power armor. It'll buy you time to drop stuff and fast travel. 
---
Rip shoddycast
---
Yeah I got it at the end of the free states quest line gave mine away to a freind who sold his so I gotta re do it now haha :)
---
I was on a server last I played with a nukes whitesprings and two nukes at site prime, then my friend and I nuked Morgantown a few minutes before someone nuked prime for a third time. The one time 76 surprised me in a good way (ironic because that‚Äôs a bad thing) as the servers didn‚Äôt crash throughout the whole ordeal. I wonder if we set off any smoke alarms in the server rooms lmao.
---
Prove it then as no one has
---
Oh sweet! Thanks again!
---
That's great stuff in the worst way.
---
Oh shit you‚Äôre right. If there‚Äôs any hope for it, it‚Äôs on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Pls I need this. 
---
What do you mean how much?
---
Thanks for the advice man! I didn‚Äôt know this, I‚Äôll stay away until I‚Äôm at least level 50:)
---
How much in caps or anything else ?
---
Uh i doubt anyone has this late.
---
I think bethesda themselves did it briefly at launch and then stopped.
---
the jangles bandana is in the atom shop for 3$
---
If there were a massive enough leak of FEV to mutate EVERY tree across the map you would be seeing WAY more mutations than just radiation resistant trees.  Now sure we have the cryptids throughout the area... but from notes those are all assumed to be descended from escapees from WestTek's facilities.  At the very least you'd see more super mutants than the ones in Huntersville if there were that substantial an FEV leak.
---
As amoral as WestTek was, they knew how dangerous FEV was and went to great lengths to keep the actual stuff locked down even if they let the experiments run wild on occasion.  They were even capable enough at the West Virginia branch  to neutralize all their FEV as the bombs were falling.
---
The existence of healthy trees in West Virginia is likely due to really simple tings like time and location.  It's only been 25 years since the bombs fell, so massive shifts in climate stability that would cause the flora to die off might not have gotten into full swing yet.  West Virginia is also in a more temperate region so what climate changes would have happened short term wouldn't have likely been very severe, compare this to locations like California and Nevada which were already a mix of deserts and constantly on fire and the effects on the climate in those areas would have resulted in wild swings that would have devastated the local flora.  Also unlike Boston which was a huge military target and DC which was a huge Government target West Virginia took very little direct damage from the war and avoided large direct doses of radiation that could have otherwise killed off flora or at the very least weakened it like in other places making it even more susceptible to die offs due to climate shifts.
---
I love this idea, add new areas of the map specifically set up for players to put down their camps together. this area would be nuke and pvp free, but laid out in a grid and your camp is placed you claim that square of space in the town.
---
if you log into a server that a camp is already down on your camps spot, its moved to another open block in the town.
---
Yeah we once had 3 nuke msgs going off at once 1 at white springs one at prime and one at the power plant everyone went out prime the white springs and them some small amount went to the power plant
---
Excuse you. I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I like the pink bed. You can be an adult and still like silly things. You just have to get over yourself a little bit and enjoy things for the sake of it. 
---
All the good people are being driven away by the broken features and crashes and all the toxic people are sticking around because it‚Äôs griefers heaven. Rest easy knowing that for someone to grief like that and even laugh into the mic about it, they have to have some seriously traumatic shit happening in their life and they feel they need to compensate, and that they‚Äôd never, ever risk acting that way in real life. Just use your mic to make them rage and go find another server with the event. 
---
Np :) sometimes ppl seel um too but I can imagine they wouldn't be cheap.
---
Yeah, I get it and sorry if I came off all pissy.  I've had the same issues with server drops and the game freezing.  
---
Is there a reward for nuking the SBQ AND killing her?  There should be, but from what I can tell it doesn't matter if you do it on YOUR nuke.
---
&gt;or the amount of players that would leave if duped items are removed
---
Holy fuck. I think you just killed the game for me. If the only ppl sticking around are shitty dupers .....
---
They never should have had the endgame boss in an area that didn't require a questline gate or at least a level gate to pass in order to participate in the fight meant for people at endgame. It makes sense why low levels are showing up to this event because they get endgame rewards for little investment on their part. Though this puts a lot more strain on people who are there for the fight because they will easily drop several thousands of rounds of ammo and break multiple weapons in the process to try and chip her health down little by little. I hope in the future they make it so people can't go to freeload boss fights. =/
---
I would be down for a massive buff to explosives and big guns even if it is just a special multiplier against large creatures like SB, SBQ, Fogcrawlers, Hermit Crabs, etc.
---
Not true at all. He calling people griefers because those people were... griefing. Shock horror.
---
Nice I will have to tey that after this damn storm passes tomorrow :) thanks for the info!
---
Most of them cheated to get triple digits in a short amount of time and are coming from that "ForkKnife" game.

Lol...must have missed that one, admittedly I included just now as a top of my head addition.  TY for the info though!

If he hasn‚Äôt started he can give them to you to turn in 1 at a time. That‚Äôs how I got my Initiate paint finally. Or you can make a new character, take all the Tech data, Let him start the quest, then you give it to him 1 at a time with your alt
---
Nah , i meant ppl that use duped items they bought
---
This is more or less what I thought we were going to able to do. Or I thought there would at least be a social hub/safe zone city that we could visit. It could be added later I suppose but the world and quest design kinda prevents that because new players would not have the base game experience that we did if any of the cities was changed into a safe zone. 
---
Yep, its pretty dumb
---
Well I guess this answers the question of why your karma is so pathetically low on a 126 day old account. You should write a book on how to be a cunt, there‚Äôs lots of semi-cunts our there that could use some professional advice.

You all need to get over yourselves. It‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre an adult and you have a pink princess bed in a video game. You‚Äôre already on reddit complaining about a video game how mature do you need to pretend to be? Lmao. 
---
the creaking u hear is from the pylon in front of me
---
It is in some circumstances, such as the one op mentioned.
---
They would stare and it's been illegal to sell in game items since forever in mmos or whatever these console rpgs wannabe called.

Yeah. Fucking burn me, but you know I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm with you Brother.

What happened?

This is a great idea!
---
Hazardous Oppidian Automation

Lol yes I had to search hard for a O word regarding towns.  Oppidian is an adjective meaning urban or of a town or a noun meaning townsmen.
---
I like how a lot of them lowkey try to insult the people that like these things by insinuating that they‚Äôre childish. Ok guy on Reddit complaining about wanting to look tough in a video game. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre just waaaay more mature than us lmao. 
---
Yeah, the TSE hatred is so strong that people lynch others just for owning one. It‚Äôs sad how toxic this community is.
---
What makes you think players can't dupe items in survival mode? Also people may not even be able to do the end game boss on pvp server so you might need to go with your pvp character to the pve server to kill scorchbeast queen for your end quest.
---
So what total percent buff is that? 30+30+20?
---
I doubt it. Has there been any major change based upon player feedback so far? I mean aside from the standard weapon balancing and bug fixes? I genuinely don‚Äôt know and I am curious if anyone else does. 
---
Are you sure you're not on PC? Because I swear to god I had the exact same SBQ fight this morning, level 6 idiot and all.
---
Hmmm I didn‚Äôt take control but did get the option to buy it...if I remember right it was like 50 caps but I definitely didn‚Äôt just get it. 
---
Yah I have problems with that, sorry its what I do.
---
Overbearing 
---
Would be cool to be able to construct one as Mayor of a TOWNS project. 
---
My friend got a level 40 explosive Gatling there. Not as good as 50 but still more than powerful enough to wipe the floor with any box that isn‚Äôt the queen as kill 90% of the players he‚Äôs gone up against. I could kill most people with a level 20-25 good elementary weapon even if they had a max. Max isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
Godamn, you're a moron. 
---
If I remember correctly if you stimpak at 80% health and 20% rads (relative "full" health) you get a message saying "you are already at full health." I am thinking instigating would trigger.
---
Not sure where you live‚Ä¶ but damned if that‚Äôs not the description of my house‚Ä¶ err CAMP. 
---
Thats what they want you to think was happening 
---
Because some guns are powerful enough to one hit players via slap damage.
---
Both, because the Gatling Plasma is going to fall apart pretty quickly. ;) Make sure to switch when she's low on life or you might liquify her and everyone will hate you.
---
Gatling with Martial Arts is pretty great. Slap on Stabilized (requires PA) and off you go. I (personal opinion) would leave out One Gun Army against a flying SBQ if you have a group you play with. Adrenaline under Agility is great for heavy gunning.
---
Don't forget Fireproof or you'll blow yourself up when a random Scorched bamfs in out of nowhere.
---
Love to see this but twice today the game couldn't place my CAMP due to another one being "nearby". I'm camped on the shore of the river in Flatwoods, north of all the houses (north of the motel). The last time it wouldn't place my CAMP, I could barely locate it with a rifle scope (it was down in Flatwoods by the bridge). They'll need to get that working better before TOWNS would work.
---
Really? I can't believe this is a thing. I haven't experienced it on PC and I do this event a lot because my camp is close by and I'm usually looking for serums or X01 mods at Whitesprings. I just want the xp and to help out; don't really care about anything else. Just the other day one player actually called out the Legendaries so everyone could get a hit in. I was shocked! I actually had to stop and think about how not to kill them in one shot, but the mission was successful!
---
I agree, would love to have even more residents so the town could have more lots
---
I mean how much in caps or anything else ?
---
"by normal means" lol, we arent *supposed* to be able to get inside.
---
There are many, many, many, fucking more named NPC's in fallout 4 than there are possible players on a server. And \_no one\_ should run around with a mic on all the time, because that is \_fucking annoying\_. No one wants to hear you talk to your cats and chew chips. 
---
Are you actually trying to say that your normal weapon deals more damage than a TSE weapon which objectively deals 4x as much damage? 
---
Because that would be broken
---
RNG is good. In World of warcraft you had static loot from each boss. When you get your shit from that boss, you dont have motivation to go there again. RNG can be good.
---
Ideally they only make it ham radios serve as extension of local voice.  Say something near a ham  radio and every ham radio in game that is on would broadcast it(or maybe just ones with players nearby)  then let us build han radios for our camps and we could connect with each other without having to walk up to each other when looking to trade. 
---
Imagine heading back to camp to work on stuff and just taking to anyone else that happens to be near a ham radio too. And they are everywhere
---
that's stupid as fuck
---
Odd he never talks about it, though
---
Or OR some of us have expendable income and don‚Äôt mind throwing $10 at what is essentially a hobby now and then. You feeling exploited is subjective. Honestly I don‚Äôt see how since nobody is making you buy any of those cosmetic items. 
---
2 x 0 damage is still 0 damage. Laser weapons are trash in this game. Bethesda refuses to fix them.
---
Do you also hate opening the fridge every time you want a snack? What you're complaining about, never bothered me before. And I see a Pip-Boy as an essential part of the game that you MUST use to survive.
---
And hotkeing your 3-4 favourite weapons helps switching mid-fight when one breaks.
---

Maybe they are farming for armor.
---
you sound like a whiny baby. the game has been out 2 months. Games didn't even used to come out with more content. If they just released unfinished content you would complain about that too. stop trying to be like everyone else and complain about content when people who do have over 200-300 hours each in 2 months which is better then any other game that has come out this year. This game is better then call of duty, BF5, fortnite and a host of other games people say are good.
---
We did it before and we'll do it again. ;)
---
I think we're actually at a worse point than we were before. I'm starting to think all those low level alts are just expecting free loot when someone else rolls in to Bobblehead SBQ. Before that was so pervasive people would actually leave the fight.....
---
I'm not sure if you've sold this or not
---
Nah. I like my pink bed and fishy lamp. That‚Äôs just like, your opinion man. 
---
So every time I logged out in PA before I even noticed that my core got refilled, I was abusing a glitch? I only discovered the PA log out to refresh the core about a week before they fixed it. All I did was use it to drop the number of cores I carried from 10 to 5 saving me 15 pounds for more junk. Now I carry 10 again since half the time I find them, they are only at 50%.
---
I grew up in rural Wv... I've heard stories that I know are true.

I had to correct my middle school science teacher when she tried to tell us the sky was blue because it reflected the color of the oceans.

they are bugged since launch as well hence ETC :3

Calling people that like things you don‚Äôt like children makes you the child.

---
Ok cool it doesn't hurt you fuck those other guys with compulsive problems cause you got yours the world totally wouldn't be a slightly better place if pallet swaps only cost 50 cents instead of 5 dollars.
---
JFC...WTF...I'm sorry dude
---
Or it could be that some of us like the game despite its flaws. Just a crazy thought. 
---
Back when ppl dont know about dense, fireproof and other damage reduction perks/mods/effects, this would be true, but no, if it is not noob, he wont get any damage.
---
That happened to the last nice camp I found. Vanished from under me. I don't know whether they were logging out anyways or if they saw me and worried I might destroy it.
---
Preorganized groups with top tier guns already kill her in under a minute. If you assume TSE is the problem and its effectiveness is being reduced from 400% to 156% then it's going to take those groups all of these minutes now.
---
This is a great idea, I just want to crack open these abandoned houses
---
I launched a nuke solo today. Was hard, so take stimpaks and drugs, but its totally achievable
---
Interested in hearing this as well. Those two varieties seemed to cover it. 
---
I play it because it‚Äôs fun. Why else would I play it? I love playing around with different builds and, though the camp building is more limited than I‚Äôd like, I thoroughly enjoy finding new places to build camps. My husband plays too so we have a lot of fun just roaming around and goofing off. People can like things that you don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs ok. 
---
It's a buggy, unstable mess that's lacking the basic interactive tools of even other bethesda fallout games. 
---
Not sure about the code error as I have gotten two decon showers from tech data BoS quest. 
---
Nope, fact. Shotguns do bugged damage with the explosive effect and can one hit. Slap damage is 5%. Easily achieveable by rifles, shotguns, melee, even a gatling with the right effects and perk loadout. Some guns do over 10k. 8k is easy to get. More than enough to kill most people in one hit. If not, a couple. Either way.
---
You‚Äôre one of those crazy people that I actively avoid. Have a good night.

What I'm coming to realize is the vast majority of my hard freeze crashes happen after death as I'm loading back in...I've lost I don't even want to think about how many hundreds of pounds of lead, plastic, and other junk. 
---
Exactly, mole rats can't pick locks anyway.
---
So much this.  I have to avoid that area and Hemlock Holes.  And SBQ fights.  they'll make me freeze for a long period of time if not indefinitely.
---
Seriously.   I don‚Äôt mind carrying people through some content.  But the SBQ mechanics make carrying counterproductive.
---
The only time i have used a minigun against a SBQ was when i ran out of ammo for my rifle and found one from a scorched. They have such low damage, and with the perks giving a maximum of 60% increase in damage, its still super low.

---
No problem! Like I said I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick just giving you a heads up. Once you‚Äôre in a full set of power armor and a higher level you can start by tagging the queen and the helping out with all the mobs that spawn. That‚Äôs the best way to assist the big guys doing the heavy lifting on the queen. 
---
The shiskebob in Fo4 did that too. I assumed it was the energy weapons
---
Fun fact. If everyone who has loot emptied a body, it disappears. Just saying.
---
Looking for the red asylum uniform.  If anyone has it I am willing to buy it or trade for it. Thank you 
---
We need to upvote every post about T.O.W.N.S.  Collectively it's a great idea and Bethesda would do well to try something like this.
---
It is hoax. Only way it would be posible is stacking boobleheads, but i think thats hoax too. There are just too many noobs who do not understand, why they were flagged as pvp active. Also with few legendary armor you can become really hard to be killed by other player, even with triggered pvp. 
---
So you'll never come back to this sub Reddit? Good :p
---
Once i had him run in nuke zone, He is not robot becouse he was getting damage from radiation. Every time his hp went to 0, he regened to full and moved a bit, then regen again and again until we get to his dreamed house, where he tell nobody, that her husband died at work.
---
I found that same drop at the grave but also a Bone Club.
---
Man, this thread at this point is nothing but a series of the type of toxic sacks of shit that make me sad bethesda tried to do a online game.   
---
Seriously, how fucking evil do you have to be to get your rocks off in this manner? What's fucking \_wrong\_ with you sacks of shit? 
---
Nah stacking bobble heads is real too. There‚Äôs a few posts on here that show people with their insane damage. And like I said, you only need to take 5000 damage to die to slap damage if you have 250 hp. Still only a thousand or so more if you have high endurance. Armor means nothing with the right perk cards and weapon mods. It‚Äôs simple math mate.
---
The SBQ seems to resist explosive damage pretty well, or.its the health regen bug. My TSE harpoon gun one shots just about anything but on a regular SB it constantly takes a chunk of its HP away and then it instantly gets it back. Same goes  for her Majesty.

They will end up raising the prices of that item as to make sure they meet their profit margin.

Reddit‚Äôs 76 community is volatile and fickle as fuck.
---
There was a glitch where you could repair melee weapons with that perk card that repairs weapons to 200% durability and it would hugely multiply the damage. I wouldn‚Äôt condone using that glitch for anything other than the stupidly underpowered weapons though. The ripper, chainsaw, etc.
---
I've seen far more lower levels at the SBQ fights since the whole barely clip the prime site and fight her rad free thing. Maybe the rads are the gate, nuke the whole area and fight her in it. Form some teams share rad sponge and goulish and you will barely use a stim pack or rad-away.
---
Because it would be damn near impossible to program that. Megaton in Fallout 3 was a fixed location, so they knew what to edit, where to change things. But you can drop a nuke anywhere in 76. 
---
Actually it is the exact same thing. Yes, it is the extreme, but it is the exact same thing. 
---
How'd you get the recipe?
---
showing up to someone's base and destroying it to begin with is greifing. 
---
Preorganized groups will always have, and always have had, the advantage. However, for the casual player who simply wants to participate to the best of their current ability, this will never be the case. If you agree that it will take highly organized groups the full 30 minutes, how can you justify that I need to justify my stance?
---
That's what I'm saying, no way does it compare
---
You know what they say about enemies using the T-pose to assert dominance? This is her version of that, and it's terrifying. "I don't even need to flap my wings to remain airborn, motherfuckers. I'm just that aerodynamic!" 
---
No, destroying the base makes you a griefer. Choosing to have your fun for the day be making someone else's day who doesn't want to engage with you worse makes you, in the real world, a fucking shitty person. 
---
Yeah booblestacking is real. I was talking about oneshot with slap damage (if boobleheads stacked) is hoax. My friend have full set of assasin/15% less damage while standing armor and belive me, you dont have chance to kill him. With your theory you can get bloodied super sledge and oneshot every player in game. I will wait here for your video.
---
The servers already struggle not to crash in general. Nukes currently severely mess with the stability of the server they‚Äôre used on. The engine is the same one used in past games developed by Bethesda and would already be struggling. Having nukes actually damage the terrain around them would just... Well I don‚Äôt even want to think about how horrific that would be. They could possibly just have two different textures to swap out but that would be ugly.
---
&gt;What makes you think players can't dupe items in survival mode? 
---
I never said that they can't dupe in survival mode.   I think they will probably be able to, but that just better proves my point that survival mode will be broken at launch.  For survival mode to work, duping has to be completely stopped. I don't think Bethesda will have it fixed before survival's launch. If I am right, then my point is even stronger.   
---
Is it even possible to "accidentally" dupe an item? The only ways I have heard of basically mean getting booted from the server. Unless that person was on a team, they wouldn't get back to the same server. 
---
I think Plasma wins out because the SBQ's Energy Resist is it's lower value.
---
If you get the chance, try to get the Prime Receiver for it. It only adds about 5 points of damage, but WAY more against anything with "Scorched" in it's name. Ultracite Plasma Cores are pretty cheap to make. 1 Ultracite, 1 Stable Yellowcake Flux, and a normal Plasma Core. With Super Duper you can easily make a bunch. AND Plasma Cores (Both Normal and Ultracite) scale with you INT when crafted, so as an example, when I craft one with my 21 INT points, it has about 50% over-repaired condition, which translates to around 375 shots per core instead of the normal 250.
---
There is one downside to keep in mind, and that's the condition problem most Energy Weapons have (Basically everything besides the Tesla and Gauss Rifles). The Gatling Plasma will break between 2-4 reloads depending on how repaired/over-repaired it is, and a Two Shot like the one you have will break roughly twice as fast. That's the main reason I recommend the Prime receiver: To make the most out of your limited shots.
---
It's "supposed" to filter your inventory down to only the canisters as viable targets, however, like everything else in FO76 it's a buggy mess.  You hit "transfer," and sometimes an item in your inventory will populate as it queries your inventory for canisters.  If you hit "transfer" again, it'll deposit the next item on your inventory list without a confirmation because it expects a canister.
---
Since the food bin is not a true container you cannot access it to take anything back out.  This has been happening since day 1.
---
From a gameplay standpoint, it would make power armor stupidly overpowered if you could apply multiple mods to one piece. From a lore standpoint? Maybe there's just not room for both, or maybe you need to make mutually exclusive changes to the base armor for the mods to work.
---

---
I don‚Äôt need to post a video. I already told you, it‚Äôs simple primary school math. Go get a piece of paper and a pen and a pen and do said math, you‚Äôll see what I mean. It‚Äôs entirely possible to one shot with slap damage.
---
Also, you need to read my previous posts. I never once said every player was vulnerable to getting one shotted by slap damage and I never said it wasn‚Äôt possible to prevent it if you have the right legendary effects and perk cards equipped. Of course it is. But most people don‚Äôt have that combination and can easily be killed with slap damage.
---
Yeah same here. Dupers and duped items are everywhere and they are ruining the game. And it's worse than ever.  Last night I saw a team 3- shot kill as scorch beast queen.   That is not possible without duping.  And I don't mean duped weapons- but duped bobble heads stacked for an insane amount of damage.   PVP mode is doomed from the start if this is allowed to happen.
---
Seen honeybeasts at treetops and at a motel.
---
Only, and here's the kicker, there's a mess of people who've played all the fallout games, who fucking \_hate\_ your griefer bullshit games, don't play them, and are fucking frustrated that the only way we can play THIS fallout game is on servers with the type of fucked up asshat who gets his rocks off murdering someone 1/3'd his level who can't do shit about it. 
---
I personally like to make a new character just so I can have a similar experience to my friend. I find myself discovering things I didn't the first time, that end up helping my main character. It also helps me experiment with different styles.
---
Ugh. I‚Äôve been shot with this a couple times by level 100+ dorks. First time I was under level 10 and had no idea what was going on. Never gave up a bag from it, but it did burn through a few stims
---
Chameleon deathclaw was bright blue for me :)
---
Well you can use power armor glitch and do it in 7minutes, or with good wep and knowing what to do 15minutes legit way. When i join someone in silo, i let them launch (which is bad becouse sometimes they shot it on absolutly empty place). So maybe he was just tired of ppls wasting nukes.
---
Exactly 
---
Twice over an entire weekend?  Someone call the police, this is obviously stalking right?
---
You do not own a legendary spawn, no one does.  If someone kills a mob before you get a chance to tag it are they being a dick?  Sure, you could argue that.  Are they "griefing" you?  Fuck no.  If they wanted to grief you they'd turn off Pacifist and rain down TSE powered slap damage on you.  Someone having their own priorities, in this case killing shit as fast as possible so they can get a drop, is not griefing just because it conflicts with your priorities.
---
Unless you want to cry that these griefers must obviously have also been cheaters and were using some super hacks to know where the legendaries were and IMMEDIATELY kill them then you had the same opportunity as they did to find and tag an enemy before they get a shot off.  "But I don't have a TSE!  It's unfair because they can tag stuff so easily!"  Tesla rifles, grenades, grenade launchers and so on.  There are PLENTY of AOE options out there that you can immediately fire toward a legendary or into a crowd of enemies to guarantee you get a tag in.  
---
TSE weapons are getting nerfed in less than a week and then you'll just be crying that they're one shotting shit with other weapons.
---
I know it‚Äôs not exactly on track with what you‚Äôre saying, but if you wear the steel worker‚Äôs hat, uniform, the welding goggles, and have the pump action or pipe wrench, you‚Äôd be the engineer from TF2.

Sure a very very small percentage of people, but I am responding to the blanket statement made in this post, not a niche market.

Good points. I don't want to be "that" guy who liquifies her. Just finished another successful run and brought the TSE Gatling. I'm sure the other guys were hitting harder, but I hope it helped.

"You don't like me being a sack of shit and wrecking your day, so you don't BELONG HERE" FUuuck you're garbage dude. 
---
Nuked it: some ghouls outside turned bloated but no crazy numbers or anything. Felt like a waste imo.
---
Yeah but making people start over doesn't fix it. Duped items exist because of the roleback system. Ppl trade items to a friend then disconnects so the server will do a roleback to give him his items back. In order to remove duping you need to remove the roleback system but people will complain if they get a cool item then a random disconnect will make them lose that item.
---
While I'm sure many would disagree, I think there are a ton of features in Rust that would work well In FO76. Especially in a PVP survival oriented game-mode.
---
I like this. It's in the theme of the game, and implies that it was an experimental product by SuperDuper Mart before the bombs dropped.
---
They can‚Äôt really do much damage to you. Slap damage is pretty negligible. Just ignore them and they‚Äôll go away. Or sever hop if they get too irritating. They‚Äôre just bored and looking for attention lol. 
---
This happened to me too, I was never able to delete them...
---
There is not single proof, just ppl who say it happened to them, because they are noobs and readed about it here. Until i see video of someone killing unflaged players and getting bounty for murded in one shot, I will know, it is hoax.
---
None of that shit actually works. That's part of the problem.  Pacifist mode doesn't protect your bases. Pacifist mode and slap damage doesn't stop people from being murdered in a few hits. 
---
Gotcha. Exactly what I needed to know
---
I can echo this. I‚Äôve nuked it and got the same result. It‚Äôs really not worth it.
---
Hmm, I think the mercenary thingie we could get going üòÅ
---
Pretty much every change to the game has come about because feedback given by players using online forums (including this subreddit) as their mouthpiece. 
---
Whether it‚Äôs gameplay changes being asked for, or bugs/exploits being identified, Bethesda have repeatedly stated that the community is an important source of information for them.
---
So to answer your question, this proves that they‚Äôre listening. Choosing to not implement ideas is not the same as not listening. 
---
I can't even tell what happened there!
---
Haven‚Äôt seen many foxes.
---
&gt;So you are a fucking thief. 
---
Taking advantage of pricing errors isn't theft, you tool. And the law is on my side. 
---

&gt; I have worked in retail, including my parents owning a small store. 
---
Are you using past tense because mommy and daddy fired your incompetent ass?
---
It wouldn't be impossible at all.  Each structure just needs to have two entities, the normal one and the destroyed one.  Whatever is inside the blast radius is changed for the duration of the nuke zone.  Granted that would require developed of a great many more assets, they said they were going to be working on this game for years, so it's not completely unreasonable, just unlikely.  But certainly not programmatically impossible.  
---
Anyway, it's more me musing than suggesting they go through with it.  Heck, it'd take much less effort just to wipe that section of the map of the stuff that was there.      
---
But ultimately, nukes literally do no visible damage and that's just weird.
---
Thanks. I did learn the prime receiver already.  I was just worried that I won't have enough flux, even with Super Duper. I may give it a go. I do have Weapon Artisan 3, but I've heard about it breaking fast.
---
When you ‚Äúdrop‚Äù power armor it doesn‚Äôt go into a bag. It appears just like when you place it which can be confusing. 
---
Now you‚Äôre purposefully ignoring parts of my comments. I told you to do the math if you want proof. Look up videos of how to get legit op weapons. These 8-10+k damage weapons I‚Äôm talking about are not including bobble head stacking which makes them even more stupidly overpowered. It‚Äôs all 10 minutes of math and research away. Do the work yourself and stop trying to get me to do it for you, Jesus Christ.
---
lol this comment.
---
We have a Fertilizer Producer. How about an Egg Producer? A Chicken coop!
---
What do you mean? EVERY change has been based on player feedback so far!
---
I would adore this.  I've recently been playing with the same 2-4 people over the past few days, and it would be amazing to merge our collective personalities into a T.O.W.N.
---
Even if it was something like an expanded budget/radius camp that was owned by a party leader staking a C.L.A.I.M (community locale allocated investment marker) that was shared and marked as owned by anyone in the group would be great.  I don't know how coding works, but if the first member of that shared ownership that logs in that day controlled what server the T.O.W.N was in, that would be perfectly fine.  If I see my pals online, I usually opt in to their server anyways.  If I'm the first one on for the evening, they always port to me.
---
Couple this with player vending and I'm seeing something that Father Todd was talking about last summer.
---
You having a good day makes other people want to leave the game. That's fine with you, and that makes you a fucking shitty person. 
---
Yep, sounds almost exactly like my experience. But, look on the bright side: at least you got ~~chicken~~ pie.
---
Spoons made me fat.   It's not my fault God created hookers and made me suck at math.
---
This viewpoint makes you a sociopath. 
---
Yellowcake is super easy to get in Whitesprings. All the Carrot Flowers and Blackberry Plants will become Yellowcake, and there's a TON of both around the area.
---
I went for this idea 2 months ago but only got high 30s upvotes. Congrats on breaking over 600
---
There are way too many server issues for it all to be dupers. I hate dupers, but I have never, well that I can think of, blamed server lag on duping. They have a shitty setup with no failover to allow for a problem on an individual server so that we players can avoid the disconnect. I was having problems accessing my stash the first week of open play. When I contacted the Bethesda technical team with every bit of data including screen grabs of a constant ping to their servers, a trace route looking for disconnects to the server I was on. I was then able to show proof of the drop in the connection to the server at the same time I got booted, and showed that I never disconnected from their main site so my network did not drop. 
---
They told me to uninstall the game, delete personal files from my hdd, then restart the console and reinstall. 
---
What worthless frakking help. 
---
This is 100% it. The devs like to show off their animation work, so they want things happening in your face.
---
If you look at the pump shotgun texture it says ‚ÄúRemington‚Äù on the right side, but here‚Äôs the funny part. It‚Äôs inverted. They flipped the texture and model to be left handed.
---
Haha nubs downvoting you, lets get psycho and harras some newbies for every downvote.
---
This is it, you get bounty only for MURDER, not doing damage to anyone. (also hitting camp/workshop objects or picklocking supply drop that another player requested)
---
For guns, some people are speculating after the TSE nerf, AAE (Anti-Armor Explosive) and Bloodied Explosive are the next big thing. Don't go for prime receiver until you can farm for flux sustainably. I only switched to prime receiver after I was level 100 and have like 5000 ultracite bullets made. For violet flux, SBQ blast site. For cobalt flux, mama dolce. The rest are pretty easy to farm. For perks, you will need chemist, ammo smith and superduper.
---
Actually, if the silos are producing neutron bombs, it would make sense. Behold! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron\_bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_bomb)
---
Radar says he's close to me but I don't see anything. Not even chameleon cloaking! 
---
I really don‚Äôt recommend it. You‚Äôll spend hours trying to get something useful to spawn. You can only tame certain ones from random encounters. Then it‚Äôs about 50/50 if it makes it back to your camp. Then it‚Äôll probably just get killed by some clueless player because it still has a red name and no indicators that it‚Äôs a tamed beast. If it doesn‚Äôt get killed by someone, it‚Äôll get bugged under your house when you load in or die. Or it‚Äôll just vanish one day. I really hope they make it better. 
---
Ah, my bad. I suppose if anything, it wouldn't be an uncommon phrase. Sorry about that.
---
Yeah, ever since his TF2 video I haven‚Äôt bothered watching game theory at all. They never do research for the opposing side of whatever they‚Äôre doing and act like they‚Äôve never even played half of the games before. 
---
No need to choose. Clearly SBQ is dead and second nuke was for the farming after party
---
Doubtful. Maybe if we gave some ideas of how to mechanically implement our ideas in the game engine, but even then, I sincerely doubt it.
---
tbh that's any gaming community nowadays
---
either that or I've been rather unlucky choosing my fanbases
---
With math i thought i could walk in nuke zone in trapper armor, but no. There are mechanics that limit you to get minimaly 7rads per sec in nuke zone without hazmat/PA. There will be same thing for slap damage, thats why i ignore your comments about math, that is not any proof. Video is.
---
Terrifying.
---
Nothing like doing piss poor dmg and repairing my weapon every 5 minutes! Straight out alpha test of other games.
---
That's genius lol
---
Yeah. Huh.
---
Must have been some kind of server-related error. Unless stuff like Chameleon+Weightless Shadowed Armor x5 makes you LITERALLY invisible?
---
Excavator has the leg mods to increase carry weight. Mine has +200 carry weight, there is a list of mods for both those armors I think the ultracites is very rare and the excavator might not be enabled.
---
Most of us really are good people. I always leave some spare blueprints and weapon\armor mod plans for new players when possible.  I also try to step in when I see someone with a huge bounty in an area with a lower level player.  I don't mind them shooting at me with a TSE if it means showing that not all high level players are jerks, plus I have one of my own and I know how to use it if they don't get the message.
---
The forts peaoe could build with a T.O.W.N.S budget would be amazing (hopefully)
---
What a trooper tho
---
Eh, I think Bethesda's buggy servers aren't a good argument against this.  We don't work for Bethesda or know what it is about the nuke zones that makes the server unstable.  It could be whatever changes were necessary to implement nuke damage to buildings wouldn't affect stability any more than the nuke zones currently do.  Or it could make it worse.  We don't know.  
---
And I also said elsewhere, they could just remove most buildings from the blast site, as if the nuke wiped them off the map.  Hell, that might actually improve performance with fewer assets being generated.    Anyway, I'm just musing.  It'd be cool.
---
Sharpening it with artisan repair adds damage but most players agree its damage doesn‚Äôt make sense with or without that. 
---
of course they are. They have stated it multiple times. Look at what is too come. Survival mode a lot isn't coming until march and they have PVE content that they have not told us about for the same update.
---
Scared the shit out of us, too! Right, u/skelekey?
---
Yeah, I see that.  People love being ignored, buying garbage, and defending their decision to reward a shitty corporate cash grab under the guise of enjoyment.  Just a thought
---
Atomic Shop is paid mods. We kicked odf about this at Skyrim. Years later its now ok. This is a geneelrational change, creation club was just to ease people into it.
---
" The blast would create pressures of at least 4.6¬†psi out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures. At the conventional effective combat range against modern [main battle tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank) and [armored personnel carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_personnel_carrier) (&lt;¬†690‚Äì900¬†m), the blast from a 1¬†kt neutron bomb would destroy or damage to the point of nonusability almost all un-reinforced civilian buildings. "
---
You can get the leopard print bandana.
---
I got it at one of the whitesprings vendors.
---
I think it's a 20 hour cooldown, as with most things in this game?
---
Although I've never actually seen that confirmed.
---
Honestly some days are worse than others. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the server load or what. Most days I can play all day with maybe a dc or two. Some days it‚Äôs just really shitty for no reason. Those days are rare and I usually just do something else or wait it out. Then the next day it‚Äôll be more stable again. 
---
teddy bear collection? really. They are meant to be scrapped lol.
---
While I agree PA is pretty subpar to alot of the legendary modifiers on non PA armor.
---
Omg yes. I totally thought there was gonna be some kind of boss and I wasn‚Äôt prepared at all. 
---
Quit hitting them loot boxes!
---
Oof
---
Thank goodness we have an intellectual around to tell us what to think! I almost just kept having fun playing this game despite its flaws. Now I know that I should be miserable and try to bring other people down with me!
---
I suspect real military bases were alpha targets on launch day.  Presumably very few active military survived ground zero.
---
Your talk about something happened the first week of open play, meaning before any updates. Sucks you got a shitty rep. But doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôve Seen duper‚Äôs crash whole servers multiple times. Maybe it‚Äôs just my region, but I‚Äôd say every other time I log on I run into a duper who either as soon as they spam there shit everything dies I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes. So yea there are other issue but I see this shit all the time and I know it crashes me and my game...
---
What?
---
Im being honest about the situation 
---
I got scammed like this... years ago, in like runescape 
---
Are you dumb or something
---
The plans spawn at Harper‚Äôs Ferry
---
My power armor fell through the wall, just like that. 5 times. I swear!
---
squeak squeaker squeakin
---
Ahh. Thanks. I'm still pretty new to the game. Only been playing about 3 weeks and working most days. Didn't know there was a 20 hour cool down on things. I knew vendors restocked caps each day but not how often exactly. And noticed that a lot of things respawn or restock when you world hop. But also noticed that sometimes I'll loot a building with a lot of resources, and if I try to world hop to loot it again, it won't have hardly anything in there even though I'm in a different server.
---
I'm kinda glad people are cheating so it makes people stop wanting to play the shit game further.
---
I was about to launch a nuke on my server &amp; a 44 from another silo launched one at Harper‚Äôs Ferry, maybe I‚Äôm late on the meta or something I don‚Äôt know about but idk why the choice would be there 
---
Its partly why I built my base on the south summit of sennaca rock. Takes like 20mins with marsupial and a jetpak to get there if you arent traveling. There isnt even spawn places for mobs there.
---
I am amazed at the amount of bovine respect in your possession.
---
3SBQs yesterday. Egghead serum plan ---- 3\* unyelding sentinel combat leg ----3\* instigating +1strg +50lib damage fireaxe ----3\* instigating gauss.   After like 50queens i got decent drops. RNG is bitch, keep farming.

&gt; I think that if it had been characterized as a spin-off like you said, then the expectations would be different.

---
It COULD have been made clearer to the non-gamer public, granted, but it was pretty clear to anyone who vaguely kept up with the news that Fallout 76 was very much a spin-off title. 
---
Only the wilfully blind who would accept nothing less than a Fallout: New Vegas style game and low information people would see it as anything but a spin-off.
---
&gt; If a traditional Fallout can be expected in a few years, then I think it'd be much easier for people to accept 76 for what it is. 
---
That's just not going to happen. It'll be closer to 8-10 years based on Bethesda's typical release window before we see another Fallout title, if at all. We'll have Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 to tide us over until then. I think we'll be fine.
---
I agree that the mic-sensitivity is crazy
---
Is this a P.R.O.B.L.E.M ?

Hell yeah! If they did this I would be on the radio in game more than I would play it

&gt;A while back some players discussed the idea of the Teamwork Oriented Wasteland Neighborhood System, which is brilliant acronym by the way, great Kudos to the individual who came up with that! 
---
Much love brother &lt;3
---
All cities have decent mob spawn. Maybe he was tired of whitespring, and if you are reconecting there, you can farm some legendary mobs too (maybe super mutants have better legendary pool than ghouls idk) Also there was video on youtube with someone nuking monogah town or how it is named, and he had there more legendaries than in whitespring, but you have to check if there are ghouls (scorched have really little chance being legendary for some reason).
---
Just remember guys big areas with lots of buildings have always been the downfall so far. New areas are awesome, but FPS goes down big time when loading in about 40 different 50foot tall buildings. Not too mention landscape, enemies, possible npc, etc. F76 has done very well so far and ran smoothly due to landmarks being further apart, smaller less built up towns, and not as many constant spawning enemies. The only issues so far would be when someone spawns into a world and all enemies respawn without warning(well us high levels realize it now), when the Scorchbeasts spam attack us and when we freeze sometimes at login spawn(sometimes a pipboy related issue). I really want new stuff and new areas, but I would love if this game continues to run smoothly. I never got to finish Fallout 4 due to frequent crashes in large poulated areas with many different textures. Idk even know the end game :(. I actually finished the F76 story plus all side missions and still continue to play everyday and love it even though I‚Äôm getting bored now hahaha. Sorry long rant but these are honest feelings bout possible new dlc content(not survival/pvp/pve modes)
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can give you a leopard print bandanna. The helmeted cage armor is in the game files but not yet actually released in the world. It‚Äôs either leftover code from FO4 or something they plan to release in the future
---
what a dumb idea lol. 
---
I used to use it before I had sentinel assassins. It was hilarious sitting on top of a tower at a workshop while wanted watching people run around trying to find me (They never did after 20 or so mins). Con is you don't get another useful special in that slot like unyielding or sentinel/assassin. But the pro is you're invisible so there's that
---
When I first started playing I kept a starred crossbow in my stash while I looked for mods for it. Thought it would be an awesome stealth weapon. Alas there was nothing.
---
&gt; Private servers and mods would make everyone happy.
---
With the online reaction to the game, I wonder even then...
---
More will be though at least. Probably more so when more content is made available.
---
Nice, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested. How‚Äôs it different from having a chameleon armor piece on though?
---
It's Bethesda's fault tho. You can virtue signal all you want and we can have a million discussions about human nature but unfortunately human nature is such that you exploit shit if you feel like it's not worth the time you'd need to put into it to achieve it "legitimately". Some people will always feel that about any game and if you leave in such a glitch that has been known for months by Bethesda btw and has been reported to them since BETA then you shouldn't be surprised that people who don't want to grind for junk and/or weapons cause they don't think it's fun at all take advantage of it.
---
I've never done duping, I just simply deleted the game after a week cause in my opinion it's as FAR from a Fallout game as anything can be. Not to mention they made it even grindier since launch. If you make an already grindy game even more grindier that will just invite exploiters...
---
I believe you, but I didn't say anywhere that I needed them. :) 
---
I started off picking them up out of habit, but figured out in this game they don't scrap to anything that worthwhile
---
I'm not telling you what to think.  I'm pointing out the obvious.  The game was rushed, poorly thought out, broken and a cash grab.  Bethesda has done little to foster goodwill, going directly in the opposite direction by scamming people on preorders, hucking garbage merchandise after release, and responding in a completely tone deaf corporate spam manner.
---
They don't care and it shows.  You liking the game, changes none of that.  Me liking or disliking the game changes none of that.
---
You are not only supporting a product that could give a shit less what you want from it, but celebrating it.
---
Sounds familiar...  I don't know your politics, not do I really care, but I would assume you love Donald Trump.  You idiotic loyalty is a Hallmark stamp.
---
sounds like you were the lvl 6
---
So Bethesda is of no fault releasing a buggy game and not fixing bugs/exploits that have been in the game since Fallout 4? Also, many kinds of duping have been reported to them ever since BETA. So they don't have to take responsibility for not fixing the game? Only the exploiters for exploiting?
---
I've gotten a legendary chicken before. Lvl1. Got a furious golf club. Lol
---
I've done it before...  But I usually switch to Melee and move away from the turrets and the camp. 
---
As for defending a camp that I own, I usually do the same as others, take it over, defend it once, then move on.  Eventually it gets lost.  It's usually not worth the bullets unless it's and ammo factory or you use melee.
---
Today was bit different as I was farming fusion cores at one of the power plants.  I did the defend event about 4 times.  Each time I got a new set of building plans that I didn't already have...  tables and chairs...  oh my...   (grin)
---
I‚Äôd say to just ask him. I‚Äôm level 58 and my grind is 27. I usually carry his heavy stuff so he can loot more, and hold back a bit in fights so that he can still get some damage in before it‚Äôs over. 
---
you mean this thing: [https://imgur.com/a/u3bJJqK](https://imgur.com/a/u3bJJqK)
---
fully I think I play the game with a bounty almost all the time now. its like I don't know survival beta hahahah
---
Having backup killing the qsb is giving you access to the loot, plus all of the adds, and then the ability to craft the nuke mats. So yes, they are giving you things. 
---
just casually overloading in vault 94 
---
PvP will be about who have more of assasins/sentinel armor. It actualy is now too, but ppl are nubs and dont have those. Pvp will be fking boring, 
---
I have seen this like three times. this isn't a problem with camp placement or anything. the meatpiles should just disappear. or only be seen if they are yours.
---
Chameleon armor is more flexible, since weightless is not required.
---
I now use my weightless under my PA: so I am not totally squishy when I step out to craft.  It is not for serious combat, just for surprise spawns when i have my crafting perks slotted.  Having some armor is much better than none.  Weightless doesn‚Äôt weigh much :) so I don‚Äôt feel as bad wearing redundant armor under the PA.
---
... yet if you have Pacifist Mode on, the mutations will not do any damage and you will not trigger full combat damage.
---
yeah I would prefer a lot more shit then fucking plater radio.
---
Think they did it tp make the game harder, without actually making the game itself harder  y adding anything new.
---
They‚Äôre helping me obtain LEGIT items in the game. When you join a Queen Raid, do you quit out of the session if she dies too quick? By your words, you‚Äôd also be a part of the cheating. 
---
yeah waiting on a freeze for 20 minutes is more of a you problem.
---
You only get some effects. Over 15 charisma doesn't affect vendor prices.
---
Cmon, be raider all you want, but dont loot every junk from newbies, you will be throwing it away as your stash get full and those players will be frustrated and stop playing this game, cause of you.
---
But watoga is a pretty decent place to farm legendary robots.
---
Outta fuel I guess.
---
It's a pvp game they have known that from the beginning, chosing to then play the game and complain when they are attacked is beyond stupid. Don't get me wrong if they take it to PlayStation chat then there is issues, but even in advertisments they showed player raiders. This isn't new hell it takes what 40 caps to fully repair a base? 
---
But playing a game with pvp in it then complaining you came under attack and didn't just switch servers is stupid.or when you saw the prompt that your base was under attack just move your base or switch servers.
---
You may not like honestly but it's true, if he doesn't like pvp then he probably shouldn't play a game with pvp in it.
---
that's the game bro. farm farm and more farm. if you don't like those gameplay loops going to have to find another game. The queen is just a guaranteed legendary from the event and from the actual mob. Most get the decontamination shower which is quite rare and only attained from that. you don't need to kill the queen for a weapon legendary they all will drop those.
---
Think servers were being strange of late earlier me and some freinds were in a server and literally the only 4 and got a little weirded out decided to hop after 20 mins and saw no one on the map when whitesprings dead quiet something doesn't feel right.
---
I have found only one currently and the general +100 the suit gives us super buggy ):
---
I mean if interacting with others isn't your thing, there are plenty of good single player Fallout games. There will still be people attacking you there but at least they won't hurt the thing you made too much.
---
That would be fun. Have the entire world to yourselves
---
&gt; to knock off with the constant whitesprings nonsense.
---
Why? XP for the most part isn't really that important and it's one of the best spots for legendary farming, which is super important.
---
Sorta we just were kinda just figured eventually it was probably a fresh server after a reset and felt dumb at all tge opportunity we missed üòÜ
---
Meatpiles are visible by everyone until they despawn. If they‚Äôre supposed to only be seen if they‚Äôre mine then why are so many of them empty when I‚Äôm playing solo?
---
Some have, but I think it also depends on what's being asked. 
---
The stuff within their power and fits the game could work, but the ideas which mean rebuilding the whole game or simply are not viable you won't see happen. 
---
Its not illegal what are you talking about, now law makes it illegal, game developer punish people for it, its against their ToS but ToS for a video game are not legaly binding, the game publisher can punish you within their provided service but they cant sue you and you cant get into legal trouble.
---
Because war never changes...the landscape....
---
In seriousness, all logic is out in 76: so much magic like respawns and stashes and fast travel.  MMO standards that make no logical sense in this context.
---
Indestructible environment is part of that, and makes every day Groundhog day.
---
Hell, you can‚Äôt even open a locked wooden door with a mini nuke....
---
I ran nuked Morgantown once, and yes it has glowing ghouls, but they are still spread rather thin across rather vast place. Can't beat golf club in ghoul per square foot density.
---
But if you're not chasing exp/min like a madman or sick of Whitesprings than yes, Morgantown is fine too.
---
The whitespring is open to visitors, but isn't checking in guests.

Well for some reasons you believe a fresh start with different access to knowledge is going to be an even start, which is a thesis that I have used lots of arguments to proved, for which your most powerful counterargument was it will not happen. I am also referring to my playstyle not to say my own life choices are the only one which define a person as worthy, unlike you seem to receive that, but as means to explain against what casuals will have to stand. You are an example of those people who I met discussing this problem - absolutely sure they know it all and their choice is the only reasonable choice, so sure they think they are justified with ridiculing people who think otherwise. If, by now, you still refuse to step back and think a little, I cannot do anythink to force you, but I believe that we're not operating on the same level of access to knowledge and while I'm countering my own ignorance by learning all the time, you seem to be satisfied with yours. It will bite ya if you are wishing to participate in survival mode if its going to have both legendary items and a fresh start, and you will have any responsibilities besides playing a game. The whole point of getting rid of duplicates seem to be the most important point of agenda of people such like you, and it is a goal I am not against. I just prefer methods of dealing with such duping crisis that are not completely shitty, and the only one I believe is not completely shitty is to first stabilise the game then release better tier of gear, not this self-righteous ignorant 'quarantine duping' movement you represent. And I do believe I am justified in calling both self-righteous and ignorant the movement originating from the people that put all dedicated players into 'cheaters and griefers' box together with the dupers, such as this puny movement does. One think I just cannot believe is how childish is many poeple approach to playing a wasteland environment that has been rolled out before them. If you honestly believe that people who prefer to be angry that someone spoiled their nearby environment (in fucking Fallout, ridiculous) and not the people who tried to excel at such environment as they were given, have any chance in survival mode, then you are still doing all you can to dodge the reality and focus on your self-harming illusion of justice.

Bit old news for this though right? New account for trolling? The hate train for FO76 does not stop at this station. 
---
Got a real grievance? Good, voice it. This is just trolling. You have failed
---
I'm pretty sure you'll end up banned from any Bethesda game you currently own, or will try to buy in the future, that requires a Bethesda login.

&gt; limit the amount of respawns
---
Nope. Not if you know how to make em respawn at least.
---
I think a healthy dose of both is needed.
---
New content can maintain interest and the playerbase, but a bad user experience can make it unplayable.
---
Bug fixes improve the user experience, but don't maintain interest.
---
Reality is, we've been putting up with the games glitches up until now, and we can't maintain players with no new content. Bug fixes should certainly still be a priority, the the time is right for a dash of something new.
---
Yes, it was illegal to 'steal' a slave from his or her owner. You may have found the one, mostly out dated reason for 'stealing'. Freeing a person being held against their will and helping them escape that bondage is something that everyone should be willing to do. Equating slavery with theft or murder during today's society is not even close to the same thing. Murder for the sake of killing for no valid reason should always be considered immoral. About the only people that would not think so are psychopaths or some sociopaths.

Ignorance is no excuse to be an asshat.

Not if you build a 10mm pistol...  I have a silenced automatic 10mm pistol that I use when I come across lower level players and decide to help out.  I can control it better than most weapons.  One shot will seriously wound level 1 and 6 scortched, leaving the low level player to clean up.  It's accurate and you can target a specific enemy, instead of spray and pray.  Plus 10mm ammo is quite common...
---
Did you catch the spinning pictures and self closing doors?
---
Just wait till you kill the queen then get booted from the server before you can loot her body that my all time favorite and then there's the one where you get her to about half health and she just disappears never too return that's what's a good one. But keep at it you'll get something good eventually
---
I literally stopped making two story houses because every time I placed that metal stair even after removing everything it was contracted to at the top I wouldn‚Äôt be able to remove it and I would have to relocate my camp to remove the stair and the foundation under it, it really ruins the building experience when you build for ages and one stair placement corrupts the whole thing.
---
I've read a lot of these posts and while I don't agree with crashing servers.  I also don't agree that the drop rates for items should be garbage.  I've hopped servers for weeks looking for calibrated shocks and for the jet pack for x01.  I personally don't think it's fair that some get great drops when the best I've found is garbage.  I'm level 90 and always check the vendors and scrap bags left behind for anything worth using.  It's all 1 star garbage.  Now we paid the same price for this game.  How is it fair that u get to have better items than I do.  I can't earn them I can't pay caps for them.  I can't get them. It pisses me off. Sell them for 5k caps.  I don't care.  Just have them available so I can earn the fun items in game also.  I'm not a duper but I'm about to find a different game because of the shit drop rates it's just not fun.
---
It hasn't happened as much lately, but my fiance and I used to "spawn" invisible after loading screens periodically. Sometimes it would only last a few seconds, other times 5-10 minutes.
---
Yeah, can you guess which game I never played again? ;)
---
Our group send nuke every 20mins on prime fissure site, after we break server with 3nukes, we switch and break another one.

Wrong subreddit
---
It's a good idea (in the same way you had player built towns in Star War Galaxies), but it will never see the day of light.
---
1/ They chose their servers to be impermanent, it's a core mechanism which prevents any idea of a long living structure (such as a town), or any possibility to leave a constant modification to their world (no player impact). Whenever someone would logout, the coherence of your town would be put in question. The possibility of being able to regroup each player contributing to the town on the same server, each time they connect, would also be very low (server slots being filled as first come, first served). The only possibility would be to have private servers, which is not for a looong time (if ever, considering the time they take to implement the more menial thing)
---
2/ You lack the server population to give any meaning to a town: this will be a bigger structure than a camp which will be visited by what ? 10 people ? And you would have max 2 to 3 towns per server. And then, what ? This doesn't work in a 24 players server setting.
---
Honestly its a joke that its possible in first place. 
---
This is not a cheap korean/chinese MMO from early 2000s ported over to western market with hundrets of bugs ( looking at you Metin 2, Fiesta etc) neither is this an browser MMO. 
---
This is suppose to be a tripple A online survival RPG, one of their largest projects according to them and they cant launch this game without gamebreaking exploits, even worse they cant even fix them on their massive budget 
---
I have seen Chinese MMOs that had a budget of some rice and cold chicken launch with less exploits and bugs than this mess
---
Very true. I just don't end up in nuked Whitesprings that often anymore. Most of my yellowcake comes from SBQ as of late and she's been pretty generous. Worst case, I can always buy/trade for it.  I don't have any excuses.
---
The only semi sensible comment on the thread. Congrats.
---
I enjoy the sbq more when it takes 20 minutes to kill. I have done a couple of long ones over the weekend, with 1 or 2 crappy TSE and the rest regular guns. Much more enjoyable, plus all the loot from the additional mob spawns (giving the low levels something to do).
---
3 minute queen's are boring.
---
2 is an interesting insight I haven't really thought about - I understand the perspective of competetive players, not the ones who spoil their fun by eating dozen bobbleheads and wearing seven thousands TSE rifles. I do now believe a subsection of these players will indeed focus on griefing coop people in adventure mode.
---
1 I do believe that as the time progresses those leveled up players will focus on other leveled up players, and only the first few days will be absolute attrition.
---
But you'd have the choice to turn it off, so it don't really bother people that don't use it. It's a win win for everybody!
---
Interesting review.
---
The soundtrack is actually my least favorite part of the game (as well as past Fallout games). I appreciate ambient sounds but I like to listen to actual music when I game. There are only so many times I can listen to the same X number of songs on a radio station. I'd expect the future to have a wide variety of genres &amp; would also expect that many independent musicians would be thrilled to create custom music for a game. I have it turned off 95% of the time in favor of streaming other music and that makes me sad.
---
I don't have a lot of multiplayer gaming experience so I created my build based on what I liked vs based on what would make the most sense for being the strongest character, most useful member of a team, quickest leveling, etc. But that's also partly because most people decline my invitations to team or trade, probably at least partly due to anxiety about people duping/griefing/etc. ;(
---
I use it for pvp in workshops, I'm literally never found and can strike from anywhere. 
---
lol dude I was suggesting that they do that. It currently isn't like that you see all of them.
---
yea instead of concentrating on PVP that nobody wants they should try to work something out like this.
---
Can I have my respirator plz

I really like rifle gaming‚Äôs series on places to nuke, apparently monongah is decent for glowing ones too

Ironic. I'd actually been assuming that the problematic UI must be a console thing and it must be better on PC! :(
---
That could work if we had maybe some kind of large building that you can buy a room from a robot (it would then work like an apartement in GTA5). After that, you can buy in a diffrent appartement, so you can build and expose your good for sale.  
---
There weren't a lot of games where you can build your own shop except the Sims and maybe Moonlighter or other shop managing games.
---
I guess, and I enjoy the game too much to stop playing but that just seems flawed to me that it‚Äôs so grind-y and the biggest boss in the game seems to have very limited upside 
---
Can people in this sub stop posting the same stuff over and over. Every day there are about 5 posts made copying someone else's suggestion.

A very small, already banned percentage.

3 minutes? The last 3 nukes I launched resulted in less than one minute. Barely anything spawns. New players have no clue that the large creature spawns are worth more XP than Whitespring Ghouls and often drop hard to find items like Handmade rifles, lever action rifles, Marine armor, springs, gears, screws, etc. The longer she is out on the field the better.
---
I'll take semi-sensible as a compliment of it means people will stop challenging that OP title screen and get back to the game.
---
Every third queen on server have this dachshund around. Things get buggy after few nukes.

Has it been confirmed to be a glitch though?

Warren Buffet is an idiot for not investing in video games.
---
I'll stick to being a hermit in my garage-shed hybrid, but this kind of teamwork and friendliness  is exactly the type of game they were shooting for. Can Bethesda just take this idea in it's entirety and run with it, with some kind of loose permission from people here? I think they'd do a similar idea and call it something different and maybe give credit to the fans, or not at all.
---
This happened to me twice! It was the beginning of me stopping playing 
---
I had an argument about this on another site. Somebody basically telling me FO76 is a bad game and Bethesda are 'making things worse' by banning players for cheating.
---
I mean what the fuck else do you do when people are cheating to get free overpowered weapons and destroying the game's balance and economy? Just because there's an exploit doesn't mean it's Bethesda/FO76's fault people are cheating pricks.
---
I wouldn't say its only possible through duping. You can get a limitless supply of ammo from the plant, and repair materials from several farms in the game, or the scattered junk extractors around the map. A minigun is still impractical, but very easy to repair if you know where to look.

I lost a Vampire .45 cal automatic machine gun today.  The lag monster got me when I was dropping stuff I didn't need and instead of going down one more in the list it stopped.  Normally it's there in the paper bag...  but nope, no bag no nothing...  I even tried the trick of dropping something minor value, hoping that it would show up in the bag, nothing...
---
Doesn't measure up to some of the other posts, but that one hurt a bit...

Cause we all have too much shit cramping our bags and stash, haha

Modern Warfare 2 was the biggest heap of broken, exploited gash when it came out haha. I remember getting constantly killed by the Javelin glitch and landing in infinite ammo/time lobbies with some godmode dude sat at the top launching grenades at everyone.

Sadly, they kept the same thing from FO 4... you can't tame the cats :(

I don't really need increased camp budget. I just want a selection of camp items that makes more sense, preferably not behind a paywall. If you have to limit the number of items, i don't know why they flooded us with so much useless stuff and removed a lot of very basic fallout 4 stuff. There's like a million chairs, a lot of luxury preserved ones, but the toilet is broken and there's no fridge, no radio to listen to the radio stations, and the magazine racks doesn't work. And i don't know why we need so many random containers if we can't have separate inventories.  Maybe some people may find a use for huge dumpsters and large statues, but it's really freaking random.
---
already existing structures on your camp spot affect your camp budget? he's smaller without existings?
---
Tse's have been a crutch to some extent on the queen runs. An entire group can have them and do very little damage overall, because they do the same spray and pray routine that gets them by like 95% of the game. Hammer bros have been able to do sub 30s queen run since the beta, but **know the mechanics** needed to do so.
---
I stopped keeping track of the queen kills but never had an issue about killing them with rifles, non-tse will do it as long as you are perked/equipped properly and have a team that **knows the game mechanics**, we can each carry a run no matter how many groupies pop in... It's very much possible to clear her with a non-tse heavy in \~8m at last run(7 players in circle, heavy did 98% of the damage). I'm sure in time a youtuber will lift the curtain but for now enjoy the learning curve. 
---
Lvl350?
---
i actually just started to move my camp to places that are so in the middle of nowhere that no one would build there.. havent got any camps replaced for a while but i‚Äôve still had random people my friend and i have traded with as neighbors basically 100 meters away from my camp. 
---
first built in the mire next to my friend, a trader had their camp between ours. yesterday i built in the far south of savage divide, got a new neighbor from a random player i farmed the queen with in less than a day. i dont think it matters where you put your camp, soneone‚Äôs gonna have theirs on top of yours eventually
---
Would be cool if you could use it on trees to collect a lot of wood. Make it heavy but make it give you a shit load of wood 
---
Honestly, genuinely interesting conversations such as radio shows and traders that would benefit the players. Of course some people would abuse it, you can't avoid those in multiplayer games. 
---
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
---
My comment were about that TSE that you took as an example of a good lvl 40 legendary is exceedingly rare (except for duped copies that most probably would be 50 anyway) and is really an exception, not the rule. When you get those other combinations it's usually better to use a good 1\* legendary lvl 50 of the weapon you like instead of trying to use a 3\* legendary that doesn't fit. I find it rare to get a good 1\*. Getting a good 3\* is one in a million.
---
A bit harsh, many of us are really enjoying the game. The only "benefit" of people cheating at a large scale like this is that the exploits are made public pretty fast so Bethesda can fix them
---
I've got mine in a fenced off area south of the lumber mill in the top left. Rocket turrets and pet deathclaws ward off the level 5 enemies, and then if anyone is feeling brave, on ps4 if your level is over 100 it cuts the 10(0) out, so I show up as "level 14" when in reality they walk in and see my 147 floating above my head. Slap slap, eat rockets you griefing sluts. 
---
I was wondering why someone nuked Morgan town airpot. I know you said to avoid the airport but once this weekend when I logged in I went to Moragan town and there was no nuke site but there was plenty of Nuked Flora to be found and I fought a bunch of Scortched that were lever 50's ... I did do Collision course for the sweet XP. 
---
The only thing this is missing is a few more rings around prime.

Oh yeah

Agree. Im tired of hearing about stupid reason to cheat/glitch. Cheaters will always try to justify themself.

Also, if it's meat, you can cook it with something. Just go to a cooking fire............
---
Are you serious? Check out the marketplace. The most expensive items are armor, which often cannot even be bought with caps. I'm talking sentinel/cavalier etc. Besides, there is always an even better weapon than you already have, so OFCOURSE people continue farming after finding a nice gun. 
---
My god have you left Flatwoods yet?
---
As you can see from that 4% figure, most ppl won't touch pvp no matter what, so why bother with that first, instead of releasing new pve content? 
---
It just boggles the mind how short sighted Bethesda can be....
---
Haha i remember when i got Plan:chameleon serum. Some guy bought 10 of them for 1k each (was super cheap price back then). Now you must sell tones of them to get 10k caps. Crazy how economy changes.
---
weird, I tried rejoining different servers and restarting the game but doesn't fix it.
---
Same, also i did so much of monster mash and do not have trophy. Fking cheaters with platinum.
---
I'm not saying the game wasn't released a bit to fast but I wouldn't call it "shit game". I've had fun with it nevertheless and I'm seeing forward to the coming patches and DLCs
---
Yeah this always works for me
---
i found a legendary beaver once. didn't drop a sh\*t. 
---
That's really strange. I wonder if it's tied to those specific weapons in your inventory, you should try picking up a different double barrel shotgun next time you find one and see if the new one does the same.
---
not really people still sell them for upwards of 2k. 
---
I tried to open my Pipboy right away and I can hear the electronic sound of it being on but I can't see it. I usually have to wait 20-30 seconds before it loads-in and at that point I'm G2G. Very annoying and hopefully they fix it soon.

Welcome to the fallout community where any negative player interaction is interpreted as griefing.
---
Yea, a different shotgun does the same thing. I tried. I also tried emptying my inventory into my stash and recollecting it. still nothing.
---
This reminds me - at least twice in the last week I got warned that the CAMP can't be built but when I was put in game there wasn't any CAMP at my spot at all. While I quite believe it could be a coincidence (like I logged in while some other guy logged out), seeing it second time is a little upsetting.
---
The other day someone nuked the big farm in the North East. Soooooo much flux. It's nice when you get to be in an unconventional nuke zone.
---
That could be abused though...  soon as you die, disconnect from your Wifi/Pull Ethernet cord out.
---
I‚Äôm sure the duping community could abuse this also.
---
If he has a TSE pump, he likely also has nerd rage/serendipity/bolster combo. (Under 20% health, reduces damage by a ton and a chance to not even take damage.)
---
The DPS on the Auto Grenade Launcher is quite good, I usually take off ~1% of her health off with each shot and the fire-rate is not bad considering the damage you are doing. The biggest downsides of course are points investment, rare/expensive/heavy ammo, slow reload times, and the weapon is heavy. Also, woe is the person who forgets to turn Pacifist back on...trust me.
---
Sure about that? I got shot once with a TSE by this one daft cunt, then switched to melee and 1 hit me w/melee. It‚Äôs level 90vs110. 2 shot by slap dmg. I never attacked back and being in a nuke zone I suppressed my mutations. So it‚Äôs ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.
---
PC, good enough to be running mid-range, CopperHamster is my [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name, don't have screenshots or video.
---
Lost one of my best pieces of armor tonight. I saw how it happened, and was able to recreate the possibility. 
---
It was doing the Event: Feed the People, during the stage where you are adding ingredients to the hopper. I was placing materials in the hopper and I got attacked, and (presumably) the armor was degraded, and it popped into the 'deposit' side screen just as I was attempting to put something in the hopper displacing the item under the cursor. Pop over to the 'in hopper' side it went.
---
Once accidently placed into the hopper, it instantly disappeared from the hopper side list.
---
I got hit later and saw armor pieces popping into the materials list again, but as soon as I heard the shots started reaching to back out of the hopper screen. Which one could presumably imply the loss of the one piece to be my own fault, but it never should have shown up there in the first place. 
---
I understand that it's gone to the great bit bucket in the sky and won't be coming back, but hopefully this is detailed enough you can recreate the issue and fix it so others won't be impacted.
---
ps4..im gonna play with it a little while..see how it goes
---
Or simply put a damage threshold on the queen.  Must do % amount of total health damage to get xp or loot.
---
Low levels will not be able to do this.   Then they can tune the difficulty of the queen so its achieveable by people without TSE.
---
I never mind if someone picks from my garden or makes use of the facilities, but when they leave the door open... ü§¨ü§¨üò° I don‚Äôt want radrats/wolves/pissed off dogs in my kitchen thank you!

im gonna play with it a while see how it goes
---
I used it for when I jump out of my power armor so enemies cant sneak up and kill me.
---
Only real difference is you can be standing and invisible with weightless whereas with chameleon you have to be crouched which honestly doesn't make much difference. I've thought about doing a build with a chameleon, 2 life saving pieces, an auto stim and maybe something else but haven't gotten around to it. 
---
Dupers are the reason we can‚Äôt have nice things!

They said "nearly the end of the month" so I'm hoping that means Tuesday instead of Thursday since Thursday would actually BE the end of the month.
---
Thank you for acknowledging there are actually nice players out there. Nobody accepts my team invites anymore cus they're all scared from the people ranting on here :( Just want my herd mentality and squad maneuvers to kick in
---
i also use them, mostly for when im not in my power armor. say if i get bored and just wanna fist some super mutants.
---
Unfortunately I've found you can't press the pipboy or map buttons until you can move properly, or it glitches the game and takes way longer to load the world in.
---
I would simply broadcast messages, requests and ads.
---
Increasing the skill gap in a way is always good, tse's were getting too common(dupe vendors), to the point 1/4 lvl50+ had them, and were breezing by 95% of the games contant.
---
For 2k someone could sell you even recipe. Prices are really down. Scorchbeast queens are nearly extinct.
---
I used a xp glitch to get from level 20 to 50ish in maybe an hour, looked at some guns and armor that were previously locked then deleted the character and made a new one, didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I really just wanted to wear that bad ass power armor.
---
I picked up my second wild TSE flamer last night. It makes me twice as sad now.
---
Not when you can do it with actual content vs lazy nerfs 
---
i mean i guess
---
I only use heavy combat weightless with the dense &amp; BOS mods, heavy pockets on the rest. Won‚Äôt use anything else I like to creep. 
---
There are player factions that do that, at least on PS4. They have both discords and ps4 community groups. If there is someone on your server who is griefing and wont leave you alone you can let them know and they will join on you and hunt the criminal until they leave.
---
Maybe scale the boss not just based on number of players but the level of those players?  Simply have lower level players buff the SQB less and higher level players buff the SQB regularly.  This way lower level players cant swarm in and try to get in on the event and the game think a bunch of geared out, prepared and ready players are there to really take it down.
---
Radiation reduces your MAX hitpoints. As an example, the HP count would show as 265/265 instead of 265/280. 
---
It's been agreed upon that tse's were op, they needed to be adjusted to make other weapon talents relevant. They have plenty of stability issues they could be working on, but giving us another speed bump is not the end of the world. 
---
We were leveling up too fast since the beta, so much that beth has tired to slow us down multiple times. I'm genuinely surprised they haven't done a full wipe yet.
---
Agree with the premise of the OP.
---
I got one addition tho: people who are angry that somebody have destroyed their environment while playing a game about managing to stay alive despite destroyed environment are kinda self-contradicting. I'm surprised that anybody actually bats an eye on the exploiters. They are just raiders to me, part of the environment, a thrilling threat. When you see a thief in wasteland, you dont say him he's bad, you shoot him or you hide if its not your league. Anything else ain't Fallout.
---
As it sits now idk if having this on a normal server would work. The servers only allow for 24 people. Such a small amount. Now maybe like their PVP mode they're going to be coming out with, they can come out with a Roleplay mode. It's just like adventure mode but there is NO PVP at all. You can't shoot each other, you can't attack camps, and you can't nuke certain areas (like the TOWNS area).
---
The focus could be aimed at Roleplaying with other like minded people who want to rebuild the world.
---
I still think having bigger servers would help...
---
Freak Easy is one I have used for his material guides.
---
Bad Company Sarge does pretty awesome videos too.
---
People not participating in PvP because its broken are also the ones who get one shot by any weapon AND also those who don't know you don't need any particular legendary equipment not to be one shot by any weapon.
---
So often having terrible build is what justifies the opinion game is completely unbalanced.

Most technologically advanced weaponry of the time. Literally worse than a gun made out of pipes.

False. They fucked up the product. Consumers will be consumers dont try to shovel the blame away from Bethesda do not mistake the fact they sold us a broken piece of garbage at full price and consistently try to scam whales. 
---
It does not take long to switch weapons. 
---
Morgantown was the first place I ever nuked, it's good but an uncontested whitesprings is way better it's just to find a whitesprings nuke with no one in it is one in a million.
---
But not the tooltip for it on load screens.
---
All the time, it's a dangerous place out there.
---
Once I went to a SBQ fight and by the time I had fast traveled, the queen was already dead. Preorganized groups are quite good indeed. 
---
You agree to it when you play the game. You know TOS? Just because I have a gun and a thousand rounds doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm cleared to mass murder people because I PAID FOR IT AND I CAN DO WHAT I WANT! That‚Äôs your logic, and that‚Äôs how literally fucking stupid you are :)
---
The idea was to have the fight in the middle of the nuke zone so low-level players simply wouldn't be able to survive long enough to take part. That is until people realized that putting the border of the nuke on Fissure Prime could spawn the bitch and have the fight outside the nuke zone altogether.
---
I say make it so the SBQ only spawns when Fissure Prime is nuked directly.
---
How is nerfind TSE a lazy nerf? +100% damage per affix is not acceptable. 
---
Thats what the flamethrower is for... Oh wait, you said "at range" and not close range.
---
And buff their durability too. 
---
Im having so much fun with it but its  shame you were dissapointed
---
200 is not enough. 500 will fit much better. üòé
---
Can't find you on discord, add me instead annimus#7916. I'm different level though, but can supply you with ammo, can build your camp and kill launch nuke for you. My IGN is annimus
---
How about a real-time map of Appalacha? With maybe a siren/alarm that can be connected to it to show incoming nukes and events?  
---
I think it could be cool.
---
I think powered gates and doors are the same thing. They come from grahm.
---
Or a grappling bolt to be able to climb stuff like cliffs?
---
But I can see this getting abused; they removed the camp travel mats because of abusive behaviors.
---
You are disappearing down a rabbit whole here, i can assume your autistic streak has taken over.
---
In all those examples, was the person recently mocking car crash victims? Or mourning parents? Or suicide victims?
---
 Either way. I have explained what i meant by it, you telling me that i meant something else isnt going to get you anywhere. 'Get over it'
---
I'd love to get in one of the hotel "locked" houses. Perhaps building inside the house (furniture only) and such.
---
Maybe it's planned.
---
Ok. 
---
&gt;decontamination shower
---
You get this for completing this event first time. If you get rid of that plan, you have to make new character (im not sure tho). Then everyone farm her for ultracite mods plans and mainly mutation serum recipes.
---
Oh damn. I have like 5 different turret arrangements i use for my base &amp; workshops, didnt realise they take up budget.
---
Out of interest, do we know if they are going to increase budget? I would love to decorate my CAMP, but i would also like to have 3 turrets haha
---
&gt; The biggest downsides of course are points investment, rare/expensive/heavy ammo, slow reload times, and the weapon is heavy
---
It's only 10 points right? Grenadier 2 + Ordnance Express 3 + 	Demolition Expert 5. Yeah the weapon is heavy, I think you can get it down to 2 lbs with the right affix. 
---
Wasnt this the spot where the first nuke fell
---
Keep farming her and soon you will have 35 ultracite explosive vet plans like everyone else
---
Nah it was more important to make sure you didn‚Äôt actually feed the people.
---
That's the second image, after you spent caps to fast travel to a nuked area. 
---
A whole day?! Please tell me more about how a thread thats on the fo76 reddit front page, cannot be visited after 24hrs?
---
Either way, the point still stands that you replied to every comment trying to plug your video.
---
I think the work you were looking for (rather ironically) was 'Asinine' too
---
Yep, same happened to me
---
Yes they always do. And they are fixing it next patch so u will have to manually scrap it. Currently it will be used in crafting/ repair but it will show u in the crafting screen so watch before click
---
Someone hit Mogonagh (or however it's spelt) yesterday and it was full of Scorched, I have to say I got more hardened mass from those Scorched than I have on a Whitesprings run. Wonder if there's anything to it or if it was just luck? 
---
Unitll you get DC in a sbq run and all of a sudden "server full" you have been qued
---
Leather armor
---
I don't give a shit about duping, to be honest, but I think that this particular trick which kicked people out of servers deserves nothing less than permban.
---
I do tolerate some degree of cheating as I do think its actually Fallout. It also, IMO, enhances the experience of not cheating i.e. it does feel good to come out victorious from a fight against bobbleheaded raider when you are not resorting to such puny tricks.
---
I think its unreasonable to expect everybody playing by the rules from an online wasteland simulator. In first fallout entries, you could become a slaver, which was kinda obvious to people who spotted you, as you had a slaver tattoo on your face. If you'd ask me what is the right punishment for majority of the dupers, not those server-crashing bastards, I'd give you the only answer I consider Fallout: A slaver tattoo and removing slap protection.
---
I am in this situation also, but lvl 55. I started a new character with the intention to focus my build around Charisma and team perks...something I definitely did not do on my main.
---
I‚Äôm also going to let my 2 friends dictate what we do and when. I‚Äôll just be a bodyguard of sorts, lol.
---
I‚Äôve already been to one part of The Forest that I somehow didn‚Äôt get to before, so that‚Äôs an added benefit of just being a part of ‚Äútheir game‚Äù.
---
A true candidate for Monty Python‚Äôs ministry for silly walks. 
---
Ah right would have kept an eye out for you if you were on ps4 but either way love your idea wish I had some people who I could do something similar with
---
It also absorbs about 20 slots worth of perks. 
---
Hopefuly with new pvp survivalist servers all this will be resolved, and all griefers will move to them.
---
I was in this for a few days. It was really fucking weird. 
---
And I‚Äôm no stranger to roleplay, either
---
Just to say thanks for all the thumbs up guys - I've been playing the Fallout series since I was a teenager, back when laser disc was a thing &amp; PCs weren't Intel.
---
Fallout 76 is a great achievement that's got a lot of potential the others didn't but its clear that Bethesda expects us to be the story here - suggestions for crazier things we can do in it go a long way to getting there :-) 
---
Yes, this is exactly what i thought too. 99% of my Fo4 time was spent building all of the settlements to massive proportions (had to create a second character to do the main storyline, as the game became unbelievably laggy haha). I bought the game on this premise.
---
Come in to find that not only is the building inexplicably cut back, but you cant even build a large settlement with multiple friends. Smh
---
If not a troll you sir or madam fucked up
---
This sounds like something that would make base bulding actually fun in this game, I only ever build the basics so I can just get my camp out for crafting and storage, but a system like this would motivate me to actually build something decent for the sake of my town
---
I had the same thing happen.  So I took out my Two-Shot The Dragon and ended the third Legendary in one shot so they could not tag it.
---
Also had CAMP Griefers try and get me as well for the first time this weekend.   
---
Guy shows up and runs around my camp looking, then BOOM.  There goes my Genny.    Then he just sits there.  I peak across the lake and see a guy standing on ledge over there, looking at me.  He suddenly disappears (stealth I assume).   The wanted guy now wrecks my garage door.
---
Fantastic.  Got a pair of Griefers grouped up just waiting for me to shoot the wanted guy his buddy will snipe me.    I Perma-blocked both of them (Yes the stealth guy still showed up on map so I knew he was still there).  Then changed servers.
---
Trying to Grief for 130 caps??  Really???
---

---
You don‚Äôt need to find all the keys
---
Power Armour Glitch is still a thing? I thought they patched it
---
You just want hookers and black jack. I know you!
---
Holy shit that's fast, I had only once participate in sub 15min kill. 
---
If bethesda never do anything like this but make player run servers that can have mods enabled (a bit like Just Cause 2 muktiplayer mod) the community will probably do something like this themselves 
---
nope'nt

For dmg mitigation?

Non-tse 50cal does some work on its own when perked, solo its sub 10m guaranteed no matter how many   
---
chumps hop into the circle. Others like the (ultracite)gatling laser are a novelty, best slapped on a mule and never seen again. 
---
The issue is lack of game knowledge, the queen is endgame and even with endgame gear, if you lack the experience you will have a bad time.  With a copy and paste of the right builds, you still need to know how to make the magic happen. It's unfortunate that this content requires a little more thought than the other 95% kappa.
---
&gt;it's going to take those groups all of three minutes now
---
Three minutes, yea that sounds about right with two dps.
---
Eh, people keep saying that and I very much disagree. Ignoring the fact that most of the evidence for this theory is pretty weak, it being a simulation makes even *less* sense than the few minor lore inconsistencies. 
---
There is no way Vault-Tec could have predicted the BoS or ghouls or any other crazy wasteland thing we see throughout the Fallout franchise. So how are these things in the sim? 
---
Yes, it's fun to speculate about crazy theories like this, but this one is really reaching in my opinion.
---
This is definitely true but that‚Äôs why set locations and likely high-cost items implemented to slow down amounts of turret bases etc. It would be like moving a few camps to specific locations so that instead of boring old locations you could occasionally see nice player made outposts and the server deficiency coming with it would likely be easy to reduce
---
Lol thanks hope not maybe I will before Bethesda fixes this game fully haha üòÄ
---
Tinkerer‚Äôs bench you scroll down to quest items and repair the damaged mainframe cores.  I get you though, have to destroy 100 then repair 15.  Why couldn‚Äôt I just take 15 out without breaking them?
---
"A Modus terminal, just to talk to". Yeah sometimes officers start feeling so lonely, that they compelled to talk to a computer. Now that just sad ):
---
Shit Hot Over Priced Stuff
---
True I do agree bloody dupers lol
---
Yes true that bloody bastards 
---
You literally dont need a TSE gun to kill the queen ... you dont need melee either. Get proper equipment and work on your perks and chems.
---
Now that you've taken care of squirrel, keep eye out for moose!
---
Video supporting what Mistique has said.  Cannot 1 shot someone even with 240k dmg.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ)
---
I only hear it when I have the All-Rise equipped in PA... so weird!
---
Every 5 levels (5, 10, 15, etc.) you get the animation that you have a new free pack...  What this means is that you get, for free, a random set of 5 cards (I think that it's 5) and a stick of gum.  So what happened is that one of the free cards was Iron Clad.  
---
I didn't catch this at first either.  A couple of times I got a card that I needed from the free deck and then selected that exact same card to max out a perk.  I would end up with a maxed perk and a spare card of the same type.  
---
Since about level 80 (at 98 now), I've stopped picking cards until the next free set.  For example, at level 98 I have 3 cards that I haven't picked.  At level 100, I'll get the free set and then I'll pick the next 5 cards at that time.  
---
Set locations could be a possibilty but again I think the freeform aspect of camp building (build wherever you want) is the appeal of the whole thing. 
---
I think the problem is that Bethesda intended workshops to serve as this function for multiuser building, however only being permanent for the session makes people resistant to building complex structures.
---
An NPC human.
---
Whilst I haven't done any testing to prove this, I have built many elaborate camps in pre-existing structures and have never noticed a reduction in budget.
---
The reason for him not taking damage could possibly be lag or something similar. I'm running an unarmed build and people I'd normally 1 or 2 shot would randomly take no damage when seeking revenge sometimes. They'd still die after I kept slapping them around however, just takes time for the game to register sometimes.
---
If they were refunded they're probably not on this sub anymore. This is for players. 
---
It's completely not legit.
---
One time I got there and started putting my heavy guns in favorites so I could cycle through them. When I closed the menu all I saw was a dead SQB I hadn't hit while three people started shouting "You're welcome!" and spraying players with bullets.
---
I would've been really annoyed if I had needed another Plan: Ultracite Explosive Vent.
---
Well apparently "Simple primary school math" is wrong. 
---
You can already repair other peoples camps. I have happened on a camp and stayed to use the workshops. It's been attacked by spawning monsters and after defeating them, (being careful not to accidentally damage the camp) I have repaired the damage done. I don't know who's budget is affected but it's usually quite cheap anyway.
---
I collected myself a full set of weightless armor to run with the mutation and a very high damage rifle is super good to go along with it. I typically run a Ghoul Slayer‚Äôs explosiveThe Dragon I got back in the day or if I were able to find one, a high damage output hunting rifle (probably most effectively explosive.) Weightless isn‚Äôt only great because it‚Äôs armor usable for the mutation, but it is, well, weightless. My whole set of mainly combat armor weighs like 6 pounds, a definite plus when using no power armor. On a side not, decent unarmed weapons work well too. A friend of mine actually has an explosive boxing glove that goes perfectly with it. If i were to choose myself, I would probably use a deathclaw gauntlet if you choose to go unarmed weapon
---
One thing I'd gladly pay Atoms for would be a full SPECIAL and Perk Card reset. Keep my levels, get to choose all of my perk cards again but lose the perk cards I gained from the packs.
---
If someone "stole" my car by leaving it completely unharmed and popping a replica of it into existence out of nowhere. I wouldn't even be mad. I'd let them "steal" my car as much as they want but by then I don't know how much harder I can pretend stealing actually means something when the Smurfs already made a word whenever you want in place of actual words that mean something themselves.
---
I don‚Äôt think that is a glitch. 
---
It would work in french with : 
---
B.O.U.R.G (Brigade Orient√©e Unification et R√©unification G√©ographique)
---
"un Bourg" is a little town, and the acronym is Team Oriented Unfication and Geograhically Gathering
---
Last night me and a buddy, on the same team, who play together pretty much every day, started to build a co-op but due to the nature of the C.A.M.P system, we ended up laughably far apart. A little community would be great.
---
imagien you get a scorched hoard raid on the town and there is 10 of your neighbours saddling up. 
---
The word epic gets overused, but that would be, epic. 
---
Nice tip-of-the-hat to Wasteland, the progenitor to Fallout 1.
---
I dont really care at this point honestly. Im over there games anyway. Plus i wont miss a crappy launcher with old games from the late 90s, they can ban that account ill just make a new one. Regardless when ES6 and Starfield launch they will be the first games on my crack list
---
Ah ok. Well I think the present is kind of bleak compared to what it could be imo and i am therefore more optimistic about the future.
---
But i still enjoy it very much as it is now so something might be wrong with meüòÇ.
---
Im a huge fallout fan though. Fanboy...
---
The airconditioners on the outside walls of the armoury in harpers ferry are a reliable farming location for aluminium. You can get into the middle courtyard and there are more in there as well.
---
It corrects on its own. You don't have to leave the server to fix it. 
---
However, if something is attacking you, you will probably die before you regain control. 
---
There is so much wrong with this comment I‚Äôm sickened.
---
Oh no. You‚Äôre one of *those*. Don‚Äôt worry kiddo. You‚Äôll save the world one snarky comment at a time for sure. 
---
I do periodically want to sell my favorited weapons, though. 
---
Additionally it tends to do it if you don't have loose scrap of whatever material you are trying to craft from. So don't bulk everything. Leave atleast a hundred scrap of steel etc loose. 
---
Double post, but Im all excited.
---
The role of the game was to come out in to the wilderness and restart civ. 
---
You wouldn't do that on your own would you?
---
Things, you would want to ge tback to the good old days asap. 
---
And get some damn coffee.
---
so what you are saying, is me, doing something I enjoy, that barely temporarily inconveniences someone slightly in a virtual world, and has little to no bearing on their real world self, makes everything else I do on a daily basis irrelevant and downgrades me to the status if "fucking shitty person"....... do I have that right, cause you sound like a fucking idiot 
---
Not only have I not attempted a refund, I have purchased $20/month in Atoms to support this game staying online.   
---
Just like a moron, fresh out of dumb ideas and arguments so they retreat.
---
There was a bug with the workstations that will flag you as PVP when someone takes it over even if you are not there at the workstation itself. Not sure if this still exists.
---
[https://youtu.be/RIZwk-\_FfuA](https://youtu.be/RIZwk-_FfuA)
---
NPCs.
---
Since degradation is related to SPECIAL...  Intelligence (crafted) and Luck (looted)... I often wonder when I see this feedback whether it's a character build that has been maxed in those areas? Most other players I encounter seem to have invested in other traits. 
---
&gt;i'm aware you can accidently scrap them so i'd make sure i'd buy it an go straight to my stash, but still, gone.
---
"You" accidentally scraping them was never the issue.
---
When you craft anything while you have mods in your stash the "game" will automatically scrap them for the base materials they are made of if you don't have any unbulked version of that material. 
---
Hope that made sense.
---
I would like to agree with you, and enjoy the thought on how it would be fair but I a strongly disagree. Non-ts/tse dream team can clear her in \~5m, solo \~8m with however many groupies decide to hop on down. This will not be enough time for each of the chumps to load in and sufficiently tag her. I'm all for increasing the gap between the have and have nots but this would upset a large number of the mostly anti-social community, that make themselves present at dinner time at fissure site prime. 
---
Oh god i definitely need budget. Putting down 3 turrets uses \~30% of your budget
---
Say what you want man i finished every quest that was not bugged, explored every area, got my character to level 156 with some crazy legendary that i know were duped by other people and friends. I had friends with over 100k of each bobble head etc. I've seen all the stupid shit this game has to offer, launched atleast 8 nukes solo and my friends did a whole bunch ( all on white-springs most of the time and a cause the game was spawning legendary loot like diarrhea out of a cows ass we did a couple of fissure sites but the queen was so pointless at the time when loot springs just pooped loot). Call me a troll but i know this game very well and it was not what was advertised and yeah i made an alt account so i didn't get bombarded with negative karma on my main.
---
if they introduce an auction house, it would be possible to game it. it's the exterior force - sort of - that you talk about.
---
The worry is people going around destroying peoples camps. I've got mine hidden and I generally stay in stealth after my last one kept getting spammed. I ran of out materials to repair it in the end :(
---
I can give you some commas for free. 
---
perhaps it could be an atom shop purchase option. 1500 atoms, comes in princess pink, and Gold-Uranium for 10,000 atoms /s
---
but in reality, i would like to see this aswell. drop as a gift box. would be funny to leave a gift box with only 1 fertilizer in it
---
Perhaps, or perhaps they believe that the griefing will be less of an issue if players have an area that celebrates battling other players. I was so excited about the concept of being able to build FO 4 type melodramatic camps &amp; have real life people interact with them that I hadn't even considered how many of those people might want to destroy them for funsies...
---
I tried to wear the one I found! I've now got it saved like you have lol
---
You should check out [Cosmic Encounter](http://cosmicencounter.wikia.com/wiki/Cosmic_Encounter_(FFG)). It has insane rules for some races, like [Mutant](http://cosmicencounter.wikia.com/wiki/Mutant) that can constantly draw cards to maximum hand size from anywhere at anytime.
---
Yeah I do this all the time from habit üòë
---
S.T.R.I.P C.L.U.B.S
---
What do you mean fell back? The brotherhood hasn‚Äôt arrived in DC yet, and they won‚Äôt for quite a while.
---
No its not patched, but if people keep opening their mouths it will be and ill have to deal with mainframe cores that glitch out again.
---
They weren't. 100,000 of an item maybe
---
This comment makes me look forward to finally getting in to the game when I get back home later this week. Thanks for making my day! üòÄ
---
I am not sure, as I am not using it, but dont think there is way to do it in 7minutes when prep takes 5. Gona as my mates as i get home.
---
Alright gonna make it for ya, put the acorns in the sack and I don‚Äôt shot 
---
I dont know if these are in the game - but targets.
---
Archery style targets, or the people cut-out targets.
---
Also, if we hit them with a throwing knife, that knife is 'saved' to your camp until you remove it. That way we could have target practice ranges etc
---
Ive read two decent ideas here, two.  The rest is whining.
---
This is why I can't wait for PVP modes.
---
Let me explain: Lone Wanderer, Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Mysterious Savior, Unyielding
---
What does that do? The other player _visually sees_ you take damage but it rubberbands. They don't see you "die" when rez'd by mysterious savior. It pretty much looks like you're completely invincible (and you mostly are).
---
When that hits PVP and there are just tons of YouTube videos making fun of how terrible the "hit detection" (it isn't hit detection) is maybe something will get done. ;)
---
That is a very busy map!
---
That might be feature, because Workshops are meant to be "pvp" zone. Thanks for videos.
---
Any idea where it is?
---
Because fanboys gotta fanboy.
---
I saw some interesting Mirelurk variants in the lower part of the Wendigo cave that I'd never seen before. 
---
I figured the geck was what's turning everything back to normal after all these nukes. 
---
I shall have to have a look, what platform do you play on?
---
One. Alt account does means you don't back up to our convictions. If I hate something that much i would happily use my only account. No need to hide you don't like something for a real reason. 
---
Two. And apart from being buggy this game is as advertised. How has the game been misleading or fraudulent? 
---
Pencils have lead in them, clipboards have springs...  Not really farming spots, but more what to look out for.  Half the battle is knowing what to look for.  
---
Why would you waste time on getting 5 weightless, when you can just get 1 chameleon and 4 much better pieces.
---
PS4 here, I hate this bug. The only thing more frustrating than sitting and waiting 60 seconds for control is opening the pip boy in that time and realising you've now got to wait 3 minutes to restart and join another server. 
---
So why would anyone spam click on this event save a new player?
---
Pc 
---
I wish I could adopt the Harper's Ferry bot. I love that smooth talking anarchist. 
---
If only it happening made sense, this would be a lot easier. Why, oh why, do they even have corresponding scrap values? In what gameplay scenario is someone swimming in mods but short two steel?
---
Is there a path behind your house that leads to a pet cemetery?
---
With the way the game is played right now, that is an absolutely terrible idea, IMO. No offense, but im guessing u didn't get to experience the joy of griefers repeatedly destroying your camp for no reason? Well, let me tell you, if our C.A.M.S. were exposed for everyone to find, we'd not have them at all. The need to keep moving away from our C.A.M.P to prevent it being discovered by these "RP" raiders is worse enough already.
---
TIL shooting NPC enemies is griefing.
---
Do you the mod to sell ? 
---
I believe the only way to get it is buying from the Enclave. And Oh Boi do i want to be right on this one !
---
And it s so hard to get that players who find it usually keep it for themselves. I haven‚Äôt come across anyone selling it yet
---
Ahhh, I was hoping you were going to say PS4. Looking for more players to play with!
---
I don't disagree with you, in fact I think you're right, but the idea that some modest buildings made from uniform assets could bring the game to its knees speaks to pretty substantial problems, and not with console hardware.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate I‚Äôm doing the same only thing I have left to do in the game is help other progress
---
Really enjoyable look &amp; read through, thanks for sharing
---
You need to go explore some more spots.
---
Well, feel free to help me out on here when you can!
---
Mostly crap
---
Sometimes useful plans
---
More crap
---
Will do üòÅ
---
Same reason you can't combine two shot with explo- oh, never mind.
---
The bug is that mods are scrapped first for crafting over bulk items.  For example, if you have bulk steel and a mod, it will scrap the mod instead of using the bulk steel.  
---
The moral of the story, don't bulk items unless it's specifically to sell.  Keep everything as scrap.  At least until the bug fix has been applied and it's been proved to actually fix the problem.  Personally, I've just stopped bulking and turned all of my bulk items back to scrap.  Haven't lost a mod since...
---
Usually it‚Äôs a random weapon, ammo, piece of armor, junk (usually silver or gold) and maybe a plan. No legendaries. 
---
Usually what you get ends up as scrap. Occasionally you will get a decent plan. 
---
I'm aware of that. Lol. This was choosing and applying an extra card to my in play set, not my hand. Its not a huge deal, but it was an odd thing.
---
Beautiful! 
---
stuff that might be useful at maybe level 10-20, regular weapons and armor scaled to your level. sometimes a more or less decent plan, a couple rounds of ammo and random scrap
---
Same happened to me over the weekend.
---
So took out my Two-Shot The Dragon and one-shot the remaining legendary.
---
Power armor plans
---
\+1 for the Tesla as well. I have one stored for events such as these.
---
lol u can get the hardest plans to get in the game in treasure maps PA plans
---
Kinda defeats the point of an online game to do so.
---
From the moment it was discussed in E3, it was touted as online. Bethesda doesn't really owe us anything in the single-player regard.
---
Plus what would be the point? Everyone died. Your choices in this DLC would be meaningless. There are canonical endings to all the games, but like
---
This would be a bit pointless.
---
But that's just my opinion, if you really want this, I hope you get it. Not my cup of tea, but I.hope you enjoy it if it happens :)
---
Even though the invisibility effects look the same, they give slightly different stealth bonuses in practice - the mutation is equivalent to wearing all five armour pieces.
---
Welcome.  Just a note: I just re-linked the videos from another user and did not make them.   I should have perhaps remembered his name.
---
I believe you found yourself an Australian there, mate
---
I wouldn't mind just having a wise cracking eye bot as a companion.
---
Everyone should go watch rifle gaming do his what happens if you nuke "           " series. It solves this issue
---
no rule against trading in this sub in face theres a trading flair
---
1. Do not allow players to completely use their existing characters.  
---
\- Problem: This could cause a big clog of players in the starting zones if everyone is forced to start new characters. Also I'm sure there are lots of players who dont want to grind through the storyline again.  
---
\- Solution: Allow players to "port" their existing PvE characters into the Survival servers. If they choose this, they get to keep their levels, get to reallocate their SPECIAL points and pick new perk cards. BUT they completely lose all of their weapons from armor (both from stash and inventory). You get to keep your junk and recipes so you can craft basic things to get started again.
---
2. Players should no longer become visible on the map, only teammates.
---
3. No markers or names above player heads, only teammates.
---
4. No fast travelling at all. Period
---
5. Only the player and his teammates who launch the nuke should get the marker of where the it will land. This will create real sense of danger to those who dont know where the target zone is.
---
6. Buff the damage and detection range of turrets. At the moment they dont do enough to warrant a threat for PvP.
---
I thought it would be a nice way for Bethesda to redeem themselves and finally get some positive news again. I understand that choices would be meaningless but they would be nice nonetheless :)
---
Or, you can just wait for FO5. 
---
A few steps NW of Lewisburg there is a Black Titanium resource, right along the road, maybe 300 meters NW of the NW corner of Lewisburg. For anyone first moving to the Ash Heap, and is interested in seamlessly getting the Excavator PA, it is a beautiful spot. 
---
The interactive FO76 map, just HIDE ALL then click Black Titanium resource on and it will be apparent where it is. Short run to the vendor/railroad. great launch spot for getting Excavator PA and already having the titanium to do so.
---
Love everything you said here.
---
The chainsaw is awesome.
---
Weapon Artisan 3 + dual bar + flame blade.
---
32 + 12 damage per tick. It is a thing of beauty.
---
Also. Melee weapons get a damage increase for being over repaired. It's not a bug. 
---
With the nerf to the TSE, I think those kill times are going to change, perhaps double those.
---
I am not really advocating a division between have/have-nots just trying to limit those pre-level 50 for cheesing the queen.  
---
So maybe make it so level 49 and below cannot damage her at all?
---
I once had someone arrive in the last chamber after I solo'd the silo, 5 times my level (I was 55).not see his plans, cause he managed to die and J was out of stims.
---
I agree with everything you said! I'm a huge fan of no one being seen on the map except team mate's. I really want to start a new character in survival. My current one is a melee mutated monster, I can one hit everything while am in stealth except the Scorchqueen. 
---
Maybe you missed the conversations about putting power armor on frames and letting them auto recall to your inventory. You could cut that weight considerably if you wanted to. Or you have 600 frames.
---
I'm thinking that the town could be a separate map and all you do is lay down a welcome mat that teleports you from the Fallout76 main map (still have the camp marker) to the settlement map.  The settlement map would allow for extra build budget.  You could still build a camp on the main map but with the current budget.
---
This would allow people to build a nice permanent base in a community area while keeping what's in place today for people who couldn't be bothered.  I just think that it would be nice to have a central area where people could meet and plan Nuke events, find mentors/guides, etc.  
---
Personally, I don't see it happening as it would require a level of scaling, etc. that I'm not sure that Bethesda is capable of handling.  They have problems with a limited number of players on the main map as it is.  Granted, it also has to track the NPCs...
---
what? No legendaries? I've been saving mine.. 
---
Even if you truly didn't mean anything by such a comment (which I doubt greatly...), you have to understand how that sentence is structured and delivered. It's nothing but a cruel and heartless thing to say to anyone. Imagine saying such a line to someone who's in mourning. Another example that's essentially the same as what you said: "I never wished that your husband would die so early in his life, and I know you loved him dearly, but now that he's dead, I hope you will realize how toxic and terrible of a human being you are". Do you really not understand how that sounds...? It's just about one of the most horribly insensitive comments you can make to someone, and if you're in any kind of relationship with them, could immediately destroy it. It doesn't matter what you meant by it, the way it sounds is an awful thing to say. If anything, an actually autistic person (the actual disorder) would have trouble understanding what could possibly be negative by this comment as the subtleties of language are ever confusing and elusive to some of them. Would you ever say such a comment towards someone you care about? Imagine saying that to someone who happens to actually not be at all toxic and a terrible human being (which only makes such a comment even worse). You are almost directly saying that that someone should suffer horribly because of a few comments someone made on the internet, and for that someone to experience suffering from the deaths of complete bystanders that they care for, and as they're experiencing that degree of suffering, will hopefully realize just how bad of a person they are. No one you say that to in person would ever interpret such a comment in a "totally not extremely threatening" way. Try and say what you said, word for word, in a bar or other public place and not get your teeth knocked out, or at least be approached by someone very aggressively, or even just be told to leave. Say that to people you know and ask them how it sounds. I dare you to say it. Feel free to reply here after doing so.
---
Find the Freak show location and the dog helmet is there on a dog corpse.
---
Definitely. And I think that's a good thing, provided they give us the actual tools to do so. I actually like FO76 because it doesn't feel like most MMOs out there, with static NPCs and scripted conversations. It feels like it actually could be more player-driven than other games. But it needs to have that sort of thing enabled and supported by the developers.
---
&gt; license agreements are a thing right? 
---
Yeah like that one time I downloaded a digital version of Catcher in the Rye that had "must kill JFK" in the EULA. I sure hope JFK comes back to life so I don't lose my $.99 purchase to the completely unreviewed yet apparently legally ironclad user agreement contracts.
---
Actually it's like a thief claiming it's the stores fault they stole bc the item they bought was shit. I am in no way advocating for duping, it's wrong. I just want to point out that store bit üòå
---
Awoo
---
 that all makes sense, thanks ill keep that all in mind in future. I feel stupid posting this now but it had me brain in a mush lol 
---
If I had to choose between dealing with copyright law and banning a couple people for playing music I couldn't press that ban button fast enough tbh

*sobs in full sentinals armor*
---
I setup camp near there around level 17 near the stream and by the security guards. Mostly only time camp is attacked if I venture close to the pool area (as referenced above with a spawn area) or up the golf green. Might move as it‚Äôs very popular and keep getting camp cannot be placed 
---
Re:  5)
---
Not that it's a bad thing, but it will cause any lower lvl players, and those without Rad protection to flock to the vault 76/flatwoods area. It's presumed safe. 
---
Chameleon armour you remain in stealth when shooting. Chameleon mutation with weightless armour you don‚Äôt.
---
Bring back the Garden of Even Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.). Make it the award for a series of quests you have to complete with the same players in a group.  Once you acquire the G.E.C.K. you can use it to found a T.O.W.N. 
---
Range extended speedy Vampiric Gatling with 3x1 Heavy Gunner, Stabilized 3 &amp; Bloody mess 3. Even the SBQ can't damage me fast enough to counteract the healing effect.
---
I don't use  explosives against SBs and SBQ because it doesn't work when they are in air - they heal back the explosive effect if you happen to hit them at the range of your weapon. (This was most noticeable with my explosive shotgun, taking out a large chunk of health of an SB for it to heal back most of it. I got the same effect with my explosive lever rifle. Yes, this happened just yesterday on PC.)
---
I completely agree. This is simply not a fun game if you are looking for a fallout game imo.
---
Now they are talking about launching a survival BETA. A fucking BETA? Probably going be to be full blown battle royal in FO76.
---
Then the community manager promises more pve content too. But it's not advertised? Meaning its probably a whole lot of nothing wrapped in a plastic nuka cola shaped bottle. 
---
I am a pve player but i want to make sure that this mode is everything and more that pvp players want. Hoping it will mean been left alone in adventure mode.
---
So upvoting as you seem to know what your talking about.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
&gt; That‚Äôs your logic, and that‚Äôs how literally fucking stupid you are
---
And yet you're the one asking if it's okay or not to go around shooting people when you obviously should've just checked your gun's user agreement. smh 
---
It's kinda crazy to think how much more I'd enjoy the game if I could just make other players invisible and not see or interact with them unless they were on my team of vault dwellers.
---
They took a great idea and ruined it with forced interaction without it being in any way natural. 
---
Umm... maybe you should go back to playing those games.
---
This is not what Fallout is.  Sorry, but the truth is, the core demographic would not play this game with those changes.
---
No. They are immature scum. It's a moral issue not a matter of "Bethesda let's the practice happen".
---
There is a post on the front page rn dedicated it would seem to your argument. Saying it's Bethesdas fault is like blaming a store manager for not making their product harder to steal. 
---
We know duping is wrong. If you choose to do so it's because you are immature, lack moral standards, and are just scummy. 
---
Because the mutation is five times as strong as the armour piece.
---
Again, was this person going round mocking people who's husbands has died?
---
If someone called me cancerous, they definitely wouldn't come out of it with all of their teeth.
---
I am going to continue to indulge you, as its clear you don't plan to burrow out of this rabbit hole you are still in. So, to get this straight - someone uses cancerous as an adjective, which is okay and i should "get over it" despite having reason to be offended. Not only is this, by your opinion, not toxic, but should just be ignored and therefore encouraged to continue? However, if i make a comment about hoping someone doesn't experience this, as then they will understand why people take offence to it, I am all of these adjectives you used above? You really cant see the hypocrisy here? I'm trying to work out if you are a child, a troll, or just genuinely stupid?
---
Sidenote, i strongly doubt anyone would be able to knock my teeth out. Also, your earlier comments about how saying it would lose you your job etc, shows that you have absolutely no idea how the world works. I doubt it would even get you sacked from retail. If you ever work in a senior corporate environment, you will hear way worse.
---
Anti, not Anty.
---
Anty would mean "like ants".
---
I have a gamer wife and four gaming kids (two daughters)... and seeing how the boys sometimes talk with their mates has had me looking closer at it (one of them is currently on a 2 month ban for language he used).
---
I‚Äôve seen the theory floated that this is more widespread on PSN and XB1 than on PC because the entry ticket for consoles is lower, making them a popular choice for younger kids, who in turn find it a great place to experiment with crass language, racist or sexist slurs and what not with less adult scrutiny than they have in IRL. 
---
Happens on PC as well, but it turns out 12yo‚Äôs are more likely to have their parents buy them a $200 appliance than a 4 figure upwards game rig, and PC audiences are more mature. 
---
A few weeks ago, here on this subreddit, there was an exchange in that vein where women on PS4 were complaining about childish responses to a woman‚Äôs voice in the game, while someone else on PC responded with something like ‚Äúno idea what you‚Äôre talking about, everyone I‚Äôve met is cool‚Äù. Not a statistically meaningful sample, but kind of aligns with the ‚Äúplatform you choose comes with its crowd‚Äù theory. 
---
and you can decide to play with 0 perk cards equipped to RP suck even more, for an even greater game experience
---
Idk about plans but you can clear the glassed caver every so often and get new pieces from taggerdys body

Paging u/oxhorn
---
I found one in some laundromat in a big town in the Ashlands.
---
Legendary level 3 duct tape would be a thing of beauty.
---
So there is daily quests? This is kinda a new information for me. It might be the case that how daily quests are triggered that I have completely missed them. It would be super cool to see in one view, where these quests are.
---
Sometimes if you kill them too fast, the client and server desync and you don't get anything. In this case, keep killing nearby enemies and they often will get the missed legendary drops. This happens to me quite often at Whitesprings; legendary mobs are empty or have regular items while normal mobs have 1 or even 2 legendary drops. Also the current understanding about in-game luck is that it doesn't matter.
---
LOL this game I don't know. Played they whole Straya Day weekend again doing nothing but farming legendaries and fighting the SBQ.
---
Good times. No idea why I like it so much to be honest.
---
that's a great thread, I responded to it also.
---
Before shady sands had that problem it was Junktown, the demo for the game was put out before the game released, via PC gamer demo CD.  Junktown was still in the full game a few beats in.
---
Bethesda should Punish Dupers so hard...
---
If they really have the possibility of tracking dupers down, they should flag them as cheaters in game and make them Hostile to everyone else; and maybe force theyr characters to wear a ridicolous hat for 1 month or 2, something that would be remembered on you tube.. that would give some justice to the community :)
---
I also had similar experience as I fight about 2-3 alone to launch nuke. For me, this random dude marched to launch a nuke when I was 2-5 meters away to console as I just died and spawn location is pretty far.
---
This made me shed a tear.
---
So far you are the only 1 out of 5 who doesnt like it. Perhaps you shouldn't speak on behalf of the "core demographic". Have you even played the old school Fallouts? Do you know how hardcore they were?
---
Once he got stuck between two rock and fire underneath him.. it was just endless mental being destroyed sound 
---
How the fuck does that work?
---
the bad stuff sayers have heads filled with bad stuff, consider that, its not this game that contains the bad stuff.
---
I still prefer chucking it into a cash register. I use the one in the golf club often and I found someone else doing it as well over the weekend. Was nice to pick up the stuff I wanted that he / she didn't and replace it with the stuff I didn't want.
---
The core of fallout players aren't playing 76 and those who do aren't going to be playing 76SM 
---
It's going to be A) empty as hell B) nothing but clones everyone using the same armor build 
---
Unless they drastically change how some of the armor perks work most people won't play it
---
i would bring you into the game right now, this instant, if bethesda had listen to me and adding sharing copy / a modern day spin on the share Spawn copy that diablo came with. there had been no game like diablo really so when they released it they included a copy for installing it on our friends computers because they were skeptical.
---
A minor quibble: Yankees are the northerners, the Union. It‚Äôs a term we Southerners/Confederates use to refer to northerners. 
---
Wait, how the Fuck would you get 10,000 bobble heads and what is a TSE?
---
Haha yea basically did the same. It's fairly entertaining to put down such a massive bullet Sponge. 
---
And Yea, this game is overdue on new content like months ago. But aye, it's either new content or bug fixes first and I'd rather have the fixes.
---
No they shouldn't on the grounds that coal is the right material for the job in real life. 
---
Besides it's not hard to get all the coal you need in game for it. 
---
Nor is it hard to get purified water in game either!
---
You *can*
---
I went and opened all mine yesterday
---
Like 60 maps. So much garbage. One T-60 leg plans. More motion assist servos ^yay... and a few camp items
---
Backwater mine has a few coal deposits in he first opening where typically wolves or mole rats spawn in. 
---
I'm not the same guy, but it's not hard to be a bit in both groups. You can play the game as you would in other fallout games, take your time, smell the roses, get things as you go, which is perfectly fine, but if you ALWAYS put yourself in that "get things as you go" mindset, then you're likely not going to get any decent armor or weapons for a long. as. hell. time. Sometimes it doesn't matter how much time you put into it. I have zero desire to pay any actual money for such items. None. If I can get the item through a random trade, that's pretty sweet. It was a totally random encounter that I got lucky with. Getting such items through finding someone to trade (for caps) with on a sub reddit or other source feels like using a cheat code and doesn't feel all that different from paying-to-win for me. If I've already gone through a ridiculous amount of time and effort (like 150+ hours) trying to get a particular legendary, I'd definitely consider finding someone to trade with. It's not like I didn't earn it at that point, and beyond that point it's masochistic really. It won't be as remotely as satisfying to get it that way, but there's also a point where you stop caring about that. In other games though, like Warframe, there are items you literally can't obtain without trading (like limited time items), or are so, so not worth the effort of attempting to earn it yourself. With Warframe, that's just the nature of the game. You can earn a lot of things, but there are also things you simply can't (and there are few of them), so you get them however you can. Fallout 76 is 99% you can earn it yourself, so I'd rather earn it MYSELF.
---
I don't always grind for legendaries at whitesprings either. There are other places that are actually quite decent, if not a bit better actually. It's still luck, but I tend to get more 3* enemies with 3* star legendaries when they're not from ghouls. Still haven't gotten anything particularly great, but I've gotten more 3* stuff outside of whitesprings. Ghouls just seem to be extraordinarily finicky.
---
Please explain to me what a mule is?
---
Is that another character you e created strictly to store shit on?
---
Because that‚Äôs a good idea.
---
This,  fallout76 isn't fallout 5. never has been advertised this way, never will be.
---
I hope there are More games like 76 produced by them.
---
Are you trying to tell me there's bugs in this game?
---
??you can sell ammo for zero caps guy
---
Those were non-e/tse weapon times, certain hammer bros had it locked down to 30s(ten swings). There are a multitude of game mechanics present to commit more damage, but the player base is mostly casual, and aiming their main gun and shooting is as far their prep-work will usually go. 
---
The lvl8? in our main group is honestly more useful than than 90% of the chumps in the circle, she makes the magic happen in ways they haven't figured out, and adds one more dice roll for the loot.
---
Repetition: That lvl8 is more useful in our application, than the herd of chumps toting tse shotguns thinking they're contributing more than a sneeze.
---
Imagine the people providing the premium car wash putting up a sign saying 'Please don't piss on the cars' and then doing literally nothing to remove those people.
---
Well yes but you can't sell it at 0.8c per unit. 
---
Dear Lord no. Never. Not ever. 
---
The last thing we need is to make camp griefing even easier.
---
I'd rather not repair my decontamination shower 8 times a game session...
---
Lol, I'm like level 130. I have flux, just havent spent any time with the guns. I really, really love the melee weapons. I normally give away or sell most of nuke zone loots. I've collected lots of 3 star, just can't find a good combo of effects. Game loves to give me Hunter &amp; Exterminator. And armor *eye rolls* hate getting the armor. Lol. 
---
ive never seen any sort of bugs with those two combined
---
I'm curious as to why you want a refund? Don't get me wrong, you can despise this game, you have reasons to. But you can't just get a refund because you dislike a product you bought and utilized. You've played the game,whether you loved it or hated it, you still uses the product they sold you. Although buggy, the game exists as advertised, you knew what you were getting when you bought it. Buyer's remorse isn't the fault of the company, and they have no obligation to give you your money back just because you didn't enjoy the game.
---
the game is made for players who grew up writing it down on a piece of paper, IE as myst had us doing.
---
I agree
---
The game hates all of us.
---
Apparently there was a bug where if you already had the carnivore mutation and you then took the serum for the speed demon mutation, nothing would happen and you would not receive the speed demon mutation which results in you losing the 3000 caps you used to purchase the serum 
---
Those who have plenty and a kind heart will share with those who don't. They will raise a shield to protect their fellow humans and willingly walk into danger to save another.
---
Something to live by both in real life and as a gamer.
---
I think they will introduce balancing over time. Bethesda took a big byte out of something they had no clue about. Multiplayer PvP Looter Shooter from a single player RPG shop is a massive undertaking. Not making excuses for them but I don't think they knew how big this mountain is before they started climbing.
---
Most people feel betsheda released too early on purpose and knowingly. I currently think from Bethesda's perspective they believed they are ready and done. From their naive perspective they truly believed they are at the top of the mountain, ready for public launch only to realise they only made it to the overnight station at the foot of the mountain.
---
Anyhow like all the other startups before this one Bethesda will learn and adapt over time. Nerfing and buffing over multiple releases until it balances out.
---
I was giving them time to correct their mistakes but in general the game has gotten worse, months after ‚Äúfull‚Äù release. It‚Äôs not acceptable. I‚Äôm currently unable to even play the game for more than 5-10 minutes without crashing to the desktop. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôve used it a bit - they lied and failed to deliver. That‚Äôs why I want my money back. Didn‚Äôt get what I paid for.
---
And part of what you said isn‚Äôt true. Very few people knew what they were getting into and the game isn‚Äôt as advertised.
---
the game needs containers that instigate the fallout 1 barter system, no forced usage of cap numbers but the option to add a number of caps in the trade if you want.
---
I'm in favor of MART
---
Have an up vote. The game can be frustrating at times and cool at other times.
---
Tbh ik know that the geck is in the game but its nuclear power source (don‚Äôt ask how I know this or how it fixes in there but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs the games logic lol) and I would like to find a properly working geck in one of the other vaults because you never and we can do the opposite and it makes some new event idk
---
I normally hit them until they reload health then killed it, never had an issue doing this.
---
As OP said killing them two fast definitely can cause drop to disappear and normal enemies to load legendary loot
---
but they did recently refer to it as Vault Raid in a comment response to something (the thread asking for a roadmap)
---
But it says right here in the EULA that the EULA is super serious and worth at least twenty pinky swears. 
---
Might as well use them civil rights to wipe your ass when they just got overruled by the highest form of legal documentation that could possibly exist.
---
I have no idea if the second half of your post is English. But the first half isnt a fitting analogy for duping in f076.
---
A more fitting analogy would be if they copied a slew of elite car styles, after market addons, and straight money a billion times each such that your car is now worth 0 because of market dilution and the roads are undrivable bc there are soo many extra cars that there is no where to drive (aka server lag/crashes). And the larger economy is now a farce due to inflation so dollars have no value.
---
Yesterday i went through the bunker and dropped a nuke. Ported to the nuke zone. I got a couple hits on the queen and then she got flat 1 shot from 99 percent health to 0. No loot for anyone. No quest loot even. Nothing. Fuck dupers and anyone that decided to be involved with that shit. 
---
Bethesda fucked up sure, but if any of these ppl that claim to be "die hard fo fans since 1" actually were what they claim, then they would have not partaken in the duping bug and just waited for it to get fixed. Or if they werent just little bitches that cant play a game straight w o exploits and cheating.
---
Would also like to add if your one shotting legendaries with others around the same area you 100% deserve to get nothing anyway ha üòâ
---
Marsupial \~ we spend the whole game jumping up and down even in the moments that don't call for it.
---
They didnt use that ammo much, its more .308, .45 and .38 around, just look at the guns the soldiers had, they barely used the assault rifle, they used mainly the combat rifles/shotgun and the minigun and they had a shitload of laser rifles and laser-gatlings as well.
---
Because its not practical and also omni-directional. It would require double or triple assets (would you like to download 120 GB and require 32GB RAM, on consoles too?). In addition, once the zone subsides, how and why would it return to its former look or the proposed more damaged look?
---
There are many design choices in the game that makes little IRL sense but are practical for the limited environment there is. For example, carrying around a 100 pounds of power armor equipment but accounting only 10 pounds by default? Fast traveling or moving the camp costing money paid to nobody? Weight reduction by taking perks?
---
If any. I have nuked a couple plain fissures with incredibly disappointing results. Barely any mobs at all and 0 SB. 
---
Into the fire for fireman gear
---
TOWNS is a goal to transcend these limitations so player communities like what I'm part of (the fallout feed) already can thrive further and more of them can exist and form! 
---
If bethesda wants to fill the massive shoes left by SWG and every game where players could build together (minecraft, for example) they will take the game in this direction with improvements.
---
What isn't as advertised? Please explain to me how "entirely online" and the bug earnings are false advertisements. Tell me where Bethesda promised you a bug-free experience. Tell me which promises they've broken. They didn't lie about anything other than that crappy Med Tek bag.
---
This isn't a rental game. You don't ask for a refund after eating a full meal. As for your crashing issues, I know disconnects occur frequently, but you're the only person reporting a 5-10 minute frequency. I'd wager that being a problem on your end rather than a problem with the product.
---
I launch a nuke like 3 times a day cuz there‚Äôs nothing else to do but I still feel the urge to play, so nukes are how I bide my time ü§™
---
It's for Firebreather stuff, i was searching for the Responder Fireman stuff.
---
The problem is that the story is read or inferred. A lot of putting together what happened in different places.
---
It doesn't spoon feed you the story, and that apparently is too much for some people.
---
&gt; Well for some reasons you believe a fresh start with different access to knowledge is going to be an even start, which is a thesis that I have used lots of arguments to proved, for which your most powerful counterargument was it will not happen. 
---
Dude, if you're playing the smartass neckbeard the bare minimum you could do is to fully read my comments, I refuted all of what you said and explained why. You evaded pretty much everything because you have no comeback and because you wanna play the keyboard warrior.
---
&gt;"the whole duping part"
---
Yes it matters a lot to get rid of duplicates and I explained why. It would be "shitty" to quarantine duplicated to "PvE" servers only for people like you and me, people who own god rolls which are not legit even tho we did not exploit ourselves.
---
&gt; release better tier of gear 
---
Wow u so smart, "release better gears over the duplicated ones". God, you're infused with knowledge... Do you even understand that without duping exploit, said gears a.k.a 5 stars legendaries, whether if they're capped at lvl 45/50 or 65/70 will be fucking RARE. Owners of top tiers will be a so small part of the playerbase that it will not take over the existing meta, UNLESS bethesda allow legendary crafting and kills RNG at once.
---
&gt;If you honestly believe that people who prefer to be angry that someone spoiled their nearby environment (in fucking Fallout, ridiculous) and not the people who tried to excel at such environment as they were given, have any chance in survival mode, then you are still doing all you can to dodge the reality and focus on your self-harming illusion of justice. 
---
Oh my my... I made my point on this in the previous comment, you're free to go back take a read when you want.
---
Don't bother answering if you're only able to evade my points, if you're as smart as you want people to believe you are then you should know &amp; understand that sometimes your inputs are not the best and that sometime you can even be wrong (only sometime) and that is 100% fine.
---
that wasn't specific to speed demon. it happened with every other serum.
---
and yes, it was fixed. they fixed most serum-related bugs. just yesterday I got mutated naturally, equipped starched genes and took 3 serums, all in the same session.
---
don't know how herbivore would interact with carnivore, though.
---
bethesda has yet to acknowledge the well thought out posts aggregating the most prescient ideas, they seem very quiet except by the 100th time someone who is furious about something posts it and gets deemed " well thought out " enough and has random luck for a bethesda ack.

I was just watching the player thinking you really are amazing. It was a sad moment when I saw him walk off into the sunset. I have always been the sort of player to help another out when I can, so it's refreshing to see others doing it.
---
Thanks for the upvote.
---
Please don‚Äôt be one of those people who trolls people asking a simple question. My question was answered quite well by a couple of people so far unless you have more information to provide that is on topic, leave now.
---
PC. I managed to get a cheap copy.
---
Ew yuck.
---
I dunno, it seems a little silly to me. I don't know why you'd buy an online game if you dislike online play in the first place. But hey, maybe it'd work to bag themselves some good press and collect some positive opinions from people. It's not a bad suggestion.
---
While I can agree that Doomed by Canon isn't really an issue, what'd be the point of a prequel dlc?
---
The history of Appalachia can be found in the game itself, what happened and why.
---
Besides an Anchorage clone (Complete Sim, get Loot), I don't know how else something like this could be implemented, especially because we can't truly affect the timeline.
---
It feels like you want an option to add NPC's rather than Lore.
---
And this time he really means it when he says "it works".
---
The only person who gave decent advice everyone else is a cuck 
---
Ive been 1 shot in pacifist with no workshop etc. 
---
I also have seen the sbq get 1 shot and no one else  be able to loot her (even if they did get 1 or 2 hits  before her health went 99% pre regen to 0 immediately) or get quest rewards.
---
Tse is one thing. 10000x bobblehead stack is fking insane and they never wear off if you hop servers.
---
Truth has been spoken
---
By Bethesda? No. But a massive increase in damage when durability doesn‚Äôt affect damage other than when the weapon is broken, is a glitch. It‚Äôs also only with melee weapons, not firearms.
---
True 
---
It is. Durability doesn‚Äôt affect damage unless the weapon is broken, it only affects melee and not firearms.
---
I can only speak for pc but most will go out of their way to help others. Our clan spends about 90% of our time helping those of the text chat community.
---
r/thathappened
---
Somebody disagreeing with you isn't the same as trolling, try not to get emotional, I'm just genuinely curious.
---
You're within your right to hate this game. It's different to other Fallout games.
---
If you can't answer my questions, though, then I.think you already know that you're not owed a refund.
---
I lost all my ammo once and I was furious!
---
I was taking part in an event quest, the one where you have to put the flavour pots into the machine. Somehow I managed to deposit all of my ammo. I was frantic to try and get all of it back as there are constant waves of enemies to fend off.. I was not at all happy. I feel your pain bro!
---
Was that quite recently?
---
Got something similar happening to me yesterday.
---
Scorched beast event alert. I decide to join but you cannot fast travel to a nuke or going-to-be-nuked area so i fast travel to the nearest place but for some reason the game transport me wayyyy into the going-to-be-nuked area and i die instantly...
---
No biggie right ? Just another thing that should be fixed right ? And i can still go and get my junk back right ? 
---
Wrong
---
*disconnected from server*
---
Well, you might keep dreaming, but to do such a thing they would have to rethink the core of their game (which I don't think they're able to, considering the state of the game), and also they would have to use something more powerful than their excuse of an online game engine...
---
I suspect that one of the reason you have a budget for your CAMP is the limiting game engine, and that it will prevent any form of high scale structures. 
---
I hope I am wrong, and they will improve the game with wonderful things like the one you want, but I have not much hope.
---
Oh, it's difficult to get coal. You can check all the vendors. People sell stable flux to the vendor. But nobody sell coal. Resin is the right material nowadays!
---
My intention is to get a refund and then repurchase it when/if it ever becomes what it‚Äôs meant to be. I‚Äôll stick around this sub and I sub from the bazaar one. It wouldn‚Äôt be weird for others to do the same thing.
---
What a shitty game design. If I thought they cared at all I'd ask them to fix it.
---
Yeah Cdkeys had it at ¬£23
---
No...this is your punishment...ever lasting purgatory...may you forever be looking over your shoulder...may none of your junk ever be safe...your days in the wasteland will be spent naked and alone...
---
I am the same as your other reply to your question. I am both.
---
I played Fallout from 1 when it was released 20 years or so ago. I also play Warframe, the division and ESO frequently and bought but haven't started fully playing Destiny 2 and Titanfall 2.
---
For me the new PvP servers will be perfect. When I feel like playing solo Fallout for the story I log into the PvE server for the session. When I feel like legendary farming and PvP action I log into the PvP server.
---
To be honest this fallout is my favourite Fallout because I changed over the last 20 years as a gamer. I really enjoy looter shooters and PvP whilst still enjoying RPG games so great combo for me.
---
I hope they make the PvE and PvP elements as clear cut as Ubisoft did with the division. Down to separate currencies. PvE currency should be safe from PvP but PvP currency should be able to buy better gear than PvE currency. High risk high reward. In PvE similar gear should only be dropped by legendary enemies so basically PvP money can buy legendary gear that can not be bought with PvE currency.
---
Also from the sounds of it PvE players aren't fussed about legendary gear anyway since most legendary items only helps in PvP and is really OP in PvE.
---
Actually I‚Äôve used almost all of my ammos and stimpaks to kill those fuckers, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so angry, but I get the point

Yea but the base dmg also seems like a bug / doesn't seem normal.

And this slot machine sometimes just eats your spin because that clearly not lege dary drill is supposed to be your legendary drop. Or sometimes you just don't get any drops at all despite fulfilling the stupid 'tag' requirement many, many times over (shoutout to serial offender SBQ).

The text chat community does this for one another. Its crazy give the world text chat and people can bond together over servers and all.
---
As text chat spans to anyone with it.
---
The folk who loved the old school hard core games hate Bethesda and/or believe FO was never meant to be MP.  The core demographic of the old school games hated FO4 and think 76 is even worse often scoffing at it being MMO lite.
---
The newer school who began with FO3 likely worship NV and thought FO4 was shallow but enjoyable.  Some of these folk think FO should only be single player but there are those who did want MP from the start.
---
The Newest School either started with FO4 or perhaps even started with 76.  They built their settlements in FO4 and thought ‚ÄúI wish I could invite friends over to explore my stuff‚Äù or thought to try 76 because having teammates along would lighten the boredom and add replayability.
---
There are of corse folk who exist in more then one of those 3 schools but these seem to be the three big demographics.
---
I know it has been complained about a lot and that I maybe flogging a dead horse but what a stupid mechanic that we have the ability to make such great Camps but are terrified when anyone goes near it.
---
Just so sad.
---
No, that's what Libertarians *say*.  It's not what they *do*.
---
Especially as its ailed release will likely see it mentioned in various places for a very very long time aha
---
I have never heard of that shop before. Is it an independent shop?
---
I picked up my copy for ¬£20 a few weekends ago now from Smyths.
---
Forgot to mention he didn't get a bounty either.
---
Mama Dolce's. Lot of people fell into that trap. 
---
I have both and they work fine together. 
---
you should've checked the picture frames :D
---
I do know that it would affect stability if we‚Äôre talking about buildings being damaged dynamically instead of a texture swap. That‚Äôs some taxing stuff. And a texture swap would be ugly in that we would see it happen - poof, normal to destroyed. It would also kinda fade in the way things do as they‚Äôre being loaded when you join a server.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it wouldn‚Äôt be cool though. It‚Äôd be awesome. But right now it would probably set off smoke detectors in the server rooms. Bethesda have a lot of work cut out for them. They skipped a LOT of optimisation that should have been done before launch, they rushed way, way too fast.
---
It's online. They email you a pic of the key with instructions how to redeem it. I bought it mid Dec. They seem to be reliable and cheap.
---
i got all of my mutations naturally, shoving my face into a pool of radioactive water. but i think the guy who replied first put it best.

Aww, is just making a dumb little joke about West Virginia, and you had to go and say that. Anyone that calls it "fortnite 76" I have no choice but to assume has either never played fortnite or never played fallout, or both.

This makes my heart ache

I just strip naked too and wait around white springs golf club. Most players understand what your doing. 
---
When you come to think of it, it's mental how games like this connect people. Especially at the moment with all this survival mode stuff floating about, people are being encouraged to kill each other. Lower level players like me will have to take it steady.

I played since FO3 but only used consol commands and mods in FO4

That's the badger!

All I had on my was a boxing glove, so punching my way through a challenge like there was the end prize wasn't too great was disappointing!
---
Ah okay!
---
Have you bought a lot from them in the past?
---
That actually makes a lot of sense. I only started playing fallout as a favor to my husband when he found out about the making of 76. We play together so Xbox was the more financially realistic choice.
---
Yeah! Seen it constantly on here then fell victim to it with the X-01 jet pack I bought. Only stored it as I have the stealth boy installed! 
---
Wait, what? Martial artist affects fire rate on *guns* too??

I knew i had a bit of junk in my stash so i wasn‚Äôt *that* upset.

Well, not until i realised none of my gears and screws were in my stash T_T

Did anyone in your team own a workshop?

If they start to contest it, then come find you, even from far away, then you and your team are consented to PvP.

You're right 2 is just a bit too much: anyone with even a single unique item is clearly an obvious duper thinking he's slick enough to slip under the radar.

Nail on the head.

I think most people do all missions, then finish them around 60-70, then grind whitesprings after
---
No. I usually buy through steam (when they are on sale) but read that cdkeys were okay so I thought I'd try them.
---
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or what point you want to make with your comment
---
Don't hate, but I just got a quad shot prime crossbow that fires ultracite arrows. It's super sweet.
---
Level 150? Does that even exist?
---
If i get a quest to find this, and you have spoilered it for me, i am going to shit in your cornflakes
---
You have the right to be offended. People also have the right to offend. I'm not saying it's okay, there are just worse things to give a legitimate shit about. You also can just ignore such a comment and get on with your day. To waste any time on such a basic comment is just incredibly petty. You're the kind of person who is looking to be angry about something. Spend more time not giving a shit about such a basic and "offensive" comment than legitimately caring about it and complaining. You'll feel better not caring about it. It's not like you were threatened or anything. There are far worse things to be offend about. However, what you said, only comes off as threatening. Doesn't matter what you meant by it. People who you say that to will not care what you "meant" by it. People who hear you say that may not care what you "meant" by it.
---
&gt;i strongly doubt anyone would be able to knock my teeth out
---
That's cute, and I'm not sure if I'm surprised you felt the need to include that comment. 
---
&gt; Also, your earlier comments about how saying it would lose you your job etc, shows that you have absolutely no idea how the world works. I doubt it would even get you sacked from retail.
---
I said it that's the kind of shit than CAN get you fired. Can: a possibility. Say it to the wrong person, on the wrong day, and what do you know? You're fired. If not fired, then a warning. All depends on your boss or superior. Could depend on how they feel that day. Could depend on you having a history of saying such things to customers on a semi-regular basis. Could depend on how much a storm the person makes that you said that comment to. Threatening people tends to ruin the image of a company or business. Saying that kind of shit on social media these days can definitely get you fired or removed from your current position, because anything on social media can spread like wildfire. Having arguments or making threatening comments to customers is a definite no-no in many places where people work and is rarely tolerated. If you're higher up and not communicating with customers or on social media, then yes, such a comment would be less likely to have any repercussions, but that still depends on who you say it to. And you think I'm a child/troll/ or moron...
---
I'll have to take a look at them. Thanks for the recommendation! 
---
You can find them on the firebreather corpses at big bend tunnel, I got 3 in one run once, gave them away to people though.
---
No probs
---
All your actual points boil down to the fact that you consider game unplayabe because of dupers. I answered that kinda as my last answer seeing you raise points which I have enough data to consider irrelevant. I'm kinda unable to properly form messages and use the nice quoting formatting you were using, for which lack of formatting I apologise, but my mobile reddit client refuses to post any comment that uses line break. 'Something went wrong' :(
---
&gt;Solution: Allow players to "port" their existing PvE characters into the Survival servers. If they choose this, they get to keep their levels, get to reallocate their SPECIAL points and pick new perk cards. BUT they completely lose all of their weapons from armor (both from stash and inventory). You get to keep your junk and recipes so you can craft basic things to get started again. 
---
YES! Although it wouldn't hurt to not let the junks carry over, plenty of people have mules loaded with junks (legit or not), better if everyone start with empty inventory IMO. 
---
Keeping mods learned from scrapping, plans &amp; recipes would be a must but I could understand if it doesn't carry over. If it wasn't so much RNG dependant I wouldn't care.
---
Then you were in PVP without knowing it. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to add this, its awesome :)
---
There are players well over 200 and probably higher. There was a lot of exploits and abuse of bugs to get massive amounts of xp. Some have been fixed, some are still around
---
You know me!
---
:-D
---
Dont claim workshops then dally around the wasteland like this isnt a thing lol. This has been an issue for the last month after tse's became a problem cos dupers. Both of you need fireproof fully ranked, dont use power armor as tse weapons destroy it. Get a real good one hitter melee each.
---
God no
---
That's an amazing idea! ...then you set it in motion and you get:
---
Person screaming 24/7 on his radio.
---
Person yelling at his dog on the radio.
---
Person loudly chewing chips on the radio.
---
Person actually roleplaying a lore-accurate radio host.
---
Person mumbling about how Jet shouldn't be in Pre-War safes because it wasn't invented yet.&gt;!/s!&lt;
---
Kid telling everyone that /he/ fucked their mom last night.
---
I'd rather play it properly. Otherwise it's boring

Powering up the robots for MODUS (whatever that job is called), if Miners are the spawned enemy, they'll have the mole landminers with them. 
---
Scared the shit out of me, as I hadn't seen one before.

Random stuff, sometimes you get plans for power armor but mostly it's Random weapons, armor and ammo
---
Not much fun when lvl scaling from the 50 low lvls makes it impossible for your own party to kill
---
Yes it does exist without any exploits a friend of mine is level 151
---
That is how I have an abundance of adhesive
---
It is strange that after reading this post, I too want to punch a scarecrow?
---
All weight reduction perks are garbage, I'm high enough level to have all of them and use whatever suits me at the time. I have 7 power armor frames on me because I wanted to collect some PA mods and they would weigh more if not connected to the armor and the mods usually get auto scrapped if you dont apply them to armor. I now have full sets of all the armors modded out with cal shocks and more and 2 sets of X01, one with jet pack, cal shocks another with stealth boy etc. I don't need 7 sets but its most efficient way to complete a full collection. But hoarding and carrying around 200+ fusion cores serves no purpose, you couldn't use that many in a month of gameplay l dont understand why anyone hoards them, they cant be sold.
---
It spawns a few ghouls, but the flora is the real reason. If you're farming for flux, it's a great area for everything except yellowcake. Tons of violet, fluorescent, and crimson, bit less of cobalt. 
---
Its probably what 2611 said. Pepole are stacking bobbleheads to get insane damage on other players.
---
Can I hear some arguments against group / BASE level up mechanics and perks/cards for groups that have set out is a clan or a TOWNS neighborhood ?
---
Downvotes don't help that much
---
Yeah the current PvP approach is not great. I play PvP in other games but never in FO76. That will change as soon as the PvP servers come online.
---
I think they will nerf TSE as well or buff armour or create new perk cards to negate  explosive damage. Normal stuff in PvP. Every game has unintentional metas that need to be balanced over time.
---
I scrapped mine because I thought it was a glitch :(
---
1. Dupe glitches
---
2. Two-shot explosive. Particularly bad are the shotguns, they fire double the number of bullets, and all of them explode. Lots of damage
---
Break her body parts, melee her down.  GG. 
---
I like this idea,  it will open new quests and ppl wont get bored fast. Also it will maintain balance between players. Lower lvl players will be in chapter 1 while high level players will be in chapter 3 or 4.
---
I‚Äôm no expert here but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre allowed to sell accounts, on any game of that matter. But tell me if I‚Äôm wrong here.
---
Hi sorry just saw this. If you bring the torsos i will do 1500 the both. If i need to find the Torso i'll get back to you once i find it tonight lol 
---
I‚Äôm actually 17 and love the og fallout games now that I got the ability to play both and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to dont that without 76 so happy 
---
&gt;All your actual points boil down to the fact that you consider game unplayabe because of dupers 
---
Well then if you think that, it shows clearly you didn't bother to pay attention to what I was saying in my comments. 
---
&gt; I'm kinda unable to properly form messages and use the nice quoting formatting you were using, for which lack of formatting I apologise, but my mobile reddit client refuses to post any comment that uses line break. 'Something went wrong' :( 
---
No worries, if it doesn't work you can just quote "xxx" like that and go 2x underline
---
So your friend never killed a glowing one enemy? Untill last patch they were giving double xp. 
---
Right after the Demonic Deathclaw.
---
Ok fair point didn't think of that. 
---
I believe heavies and energy are in significant need of increases. I can only fire the rocket launcher a couple times and it breaks, so much I got gunsmith to slow it down just some and may end up building with luck of the draw too because explosives and rockets are my RP choice on my latest egg headed / power tech using character.
---
That's the point where they need to go find another game to play and leave the rest of us in peace. We're trying to rebuild 'Merica here, people. And not just buildings, but hearts and minds. Maybe starting with a bullet to theirs, but still...
---
Lol I‚Äôm not buying an account, I‚Äôm wanting to buy a TSE weapon. Think you misread my post
---
I might be wrong, but I think it may be to do with playing in a group?
---
you won't.
---
Yeah, i have too. A bunch. And it was glorious
---
Your sharing with your team 
---
Thank god :)
---
We didn't claim a workshop, this was at the Harper's ferry vendor
---
I should probably clarify this, though I felt I've been repeating myself in other posts and didn't want to sound like a broken record.  The upcoming setup is not PVE and PVP servers.  It's PVEVP (the original mode) and PVP servers.  Meaning PVE players, even after the update, won't have PVE servers to play on.
---
I'm talking about dedicated PVE servers, with no PVP at all, not PVEVP servers.  What you describe wouldn't be possible, because players on the PVE servers could not be attacked by bored PVP players.  They would hop onto PVE, and find themselves unable to damage players or structures, which would be the point.  PVE players don't want that, so while on their servers it simply can't be done.
---
Players who want the original PVEVP gameplay would simply play on PVP servers, since that's pretty much what the "survival" server offers, just without slapping and handshaking and pacifist mode.
---
This would also solve the issue of PVP players not having other PVP players to fight, because PVP servers would be the only plays they could fight other players.  So the PVP servers would fill with PVP players.  There might be fewer of them overall, but they would be condensed into their own servers and therefore wouldn't be running into PVE players who have no interest in fighting.
---
Dedicated PVE and PVP servers is the best way to provide both types of player with what they want.  The upcoming PVEVP and PVP servers only really helps PVP players, while leaving PVE players as the potential targets they've been since launch.
---
Wasn‚Äôt in a group, so how comes ? And i don‚Äôt have any perk sharing card
---
Also weapons and armour in my experience are the base unit without any extra mods.
---
I think it's also levelled to the area you're in so ok returns for treasure in high areas but almost not worth it in my experience for lower level area maps.
---
2 ghouls 1600 xp.
---
I did this just purely on accident.  I found Chameleon, 2 Left Saving pieces, Autostim, Vanguard.    Doing stealth/Close Range gun build (Not really sniper).    I did not plan the armor at all, those are just the 3-stars that were decent.  With other stealth abilities, works decent.  
---
But Sneak/Escape artist are way better IMO than what you get with just the Chameleon.
---
This you can share perks with your team mates and vice versa.
---
Well i wasn‚Äôt in a team, and got no team sharing perks
---
How, pasifist mode was on and we had been doing nothing but vendor hopping selling junk 
---
I think it might be a perk that activates when you are playing with a group of people. Like I said, I might be wrong.
---
Now I will have to punch every scarecrow I see
---
The CAMP griefing is silly and hopefully with the new PvP servers they will make the current servers only PvE so none of this slapping business to engage in PvP.
---
So just an other bug maybe ?
---
You probably aren‚Äôt, just another bug ?
---
Maybe I did, I don‚Äôt know what a TSE account is, what does it mean.
---
It seems like the kind of thing that is planned - like the vault entrances, some kind of placeholder for later content.
---
&gt;Admittedly it is the attitude of a kleptomaniac.
---
We're in the same train, buddy. I also used the infinite weight glitch. Now I just have a mule. I just don't understand how dupers can handle that much weight if I'm having problems without duping at all.
---
**NEVER** underestimate people's ability to completely ignore PVP warnings and clicking okay.
---
Would this not go against the idea of having a lack of world persistence because for this to be useful, you'd need to have a persistent world?
---
This sounds like a great idea for a private server with mods but I just don't see it being viable with the game as it stands.
---
Really no point to buying weapons at the start.  Just pick up weapons from enemies you've defeated or found on places and use them, because weapons have tiers of every 5 levels or so.  Which also means you don't really need to mod any weapons either until you get max level.
---
I think it is with most automatic heavy weapons, I had Auto Grenade Launcher that would break after two reloads and my friend has a Gatling laser that breaks after each large creature
---
Don't even think I have seen one!
---
this has been happening to me every time in white springs now. 
---
I have those ultracite plans i will add you.
---
Most likely then!
---
What SBQ mechanics? All it is is a flying health bar that has an arbitrary time limit making it a simple DPS and weapon durability/ammo check. That's like one whole mechanic maybe three if we're "need to make make impressive sounding back cover bullet points that are at least not easily disproven blatant lies" desperate.
---
It‚Äôs a tough one for sure!
---
It's almost not worth buying weapons. You're better off scrapping a ton of weapons rather than sell them off to then be able to craft mods and eventually the weapons themselves when you can get the plans. They tend to do better than anything you'd purchase.
---
Also, you have to learn when to use ammo and when to switch to melee or explosives. You can't really treat this game like a looter shooter, particularly in the early game.
---
I am sort of in two minds about this. In The Division it works similar. You can only fast travel to safe houses in PvE zones and no fast travel in PvP zones but the map is smaller than FO76.
---
They do break fast. I get 5-6 cores out of mine  by using Weapon Artisan to repair to 200% condition, Gunsmith to slow down the breakage, and Luck Of The Draw so it randomly repairs itself during use. But I also have Bear Arms at max rank, so I usually carry a spare plasma gatling into nuke zones along with my usual assortment of weapons.
---
Fuck, did not know this, my wife had claimed one for the achievement. Guess she won't be doing that any more.
---
Use a board (modded) or sledgehammer as no ammo required until you've got some xp, or pick up pipe weapons - ditch 'em when they break.
---
Hi, fellow French speaking personn !
---
Hmm.  I did not think about the level 8 you mention in your circumstances.
---
Most lower levels are there just to get xp/loot and not add real benefit to the fight.  She might be the exception in that case though.
---
I assume the level 8 is a alt character with legendary Medic weapons and some charisma cards though.  
---
Did you try walking through the lasers? They are usually red for me but can still walk through it. If you can't pass, it won't kill you. It's like walking into a wall.
---
Don't ever pay more than 500 caps for any serum. 
---
100-400 seems to be the normal price now. 
---
Todd Howard said it best - Fallout 76 is softcore survival. 
---
I'm not against most of these ideas (except the fast travel thing - screw that noise) but you've basically describing hardcore survival, which will just turn off most of the casuals. Say bye bye to game if that ever happens.
---
Kill Queen Then Have a nice stroll in whitesprings
---
I punch all the balloons and do a happy dance as they explode into showers of confetti.
---
These are all examples that that validate my obsession with stashing my junk.  Absolutely no need to walk around the map carrying bulked item. 
---
You can share a perk whether in a group or not. You‚Äôve just hit a button on the perk selection screen that‚Äôs all
---
yep I agree to this post for it makes me happy
---
You just have to hit whatever button to share it, it will share even if not in a team! (So not sharing at all lol)
---
You mean until the game went live shipping with the bug that can cause players to just not take any radiation damage when they should... like those low level players that wouldn't be able to survive if the thing that's supposed to prevent that didn't suddenly decide to stop being a thing.
---
TSE = Two Shot Explosive (Weapon) 
---
Some people just can't let go of the fact that this isn't a single player RPG.
---
Having said that though, sure, why not on a private modded server. Have a DLC-sized mod called Fallout: Overseer where you run around as the Overseer witnessing the end of things and maybe be lucky enough to catch the last remnants of humans before they all die off (apparently - no spoilers).
---
How come i can do this now ? Is it an ability that unlock when you reach a certain level ?
---
You have the right to be threatened. People also have the right to threaten. I'm not saying it's okay, there are just worse things to give a legitimate shit about. You also can just ignore such a comment and get on with your day. To waste any time on such a basic comment is just incredibly petty. You're the kind of person who is looking to be angry about something. Spend more time not giving a shit about such a basic and "threatening" comment than legitimately caring about it and complaining. You'll feel better not caring about it. It's not like you were threatened or anything. There are far worse things to be offend about. Just a little piece i cobbled together for you.
---
Everything you are saying currently is just hypocrisy in its finest form. I jumped on someones comment that offended me, even though it wasn't aimed at me. Same thing as what you have done.
---
No, I do not work with customers. If you heard things that were said in executive committees etc that are left out of board minutes, your sweet little blessed heart would break.  
---
 That's cute, and I'm not sure if I'm surprised you felt the need to include that comment. " - Exactly the kind of comment that someone who has spent their lives unable to stick up for themselves would say. Poor little tarquin instead finds solace and fake friendship in the internet to satisfy the hole within.
---
I think you are a child because you regularly contradict yourself, and you are getting ridiculously hung up a comment on a thread. I have said that the context was that because this experience has happened to me, that is why i understand that calling someone 'cancerous' is wrong, hence my statement. If your own stubbornness cant see through that, then move on and "get over it".
---
Nah, on PC when looking your perks you scroll over a card and hit T I think? 
---
But i ve never seen it before today, so i m wondering why/how i m able to do it now
---
I promise you‚Äôve been able to do it the whole time...other than that I don‚Äôt know, sorry
---
Bethesda games always have great and funny dialogue 
---
Yep, spot on. That is purely it. Set up camp in the same area as both characters, with an in-game storage container. I usually use whitesprings outskirts and use a golf bag, or bin. Make sure to be in same server as friend to deposit items. Do it hidden too, for grifer/poacher purposes. Log out, change character, then log back into same session as friend. You will appear at your camp in the same location and go and get your stuff. 
---
You can have up to 5 characters. If they are all levelled up too, you can get 1400 caps per day, with selling to all 7 vendors, if you have enough stuff and have completed most the main quest lines on each. Totalling 7000 caps per day, over 5 characters. 
---
Word of warning though, watch it if the server crashes. Low chance of it happening, but it does! You lose all stored in-game items, as you can't get back to the server!
---
Not quite. Fissure site prime needs a second nuke right on top for good measure. 
---
Or disconnected from server
---
Oh ok, just an other Beth‚Äô mystery! Thanks pal !
---
I am totaly in to the not knowing where the nuke will hit, it would add such needed suspence to the situation.
---
I'm level 96 or so and I hang out with lower level players a lot. Make/fix armor and weapons, build cool stuff in their camps, help them through nuke zones, etc. It's fun. I'm on PS4 too, so if you ever want a crack shot for a bodyguard or need new armor, hit me up. 
---
I play on Xbox and ps4 it didn‚Äôt happen on ps4 only Xbox 
---
I don‚Äôt care. I want a wolf, or a cat, or a pet deathclaw named mr snuffles
---
Xbox 1
---
Occasionally I have to log out as soon as I join a server because my armor effects aren't working. So I have to take all my armor off, switch servers and then reattach it. This becomes more annoying when I lose connection shortly after doing this and have to restart the process. 
---
I do that with plans and excess aid/ammo/junk but more like a resupply of the Overseer's stash box than a treasure hunt.
---
7 - weapon spawns are now a rarity and players will run across one another at known locations they MIGHT spawn, the mechanic of repeatable player traffic to locations results in the drama of POTENTIALLY unfriendly interactions
---
So you played the game for 200+ hours then demanded your money back?  Shame on your parents for not teaching the concept of character and integrity.  
---
I liked 76 somewhat but I just thought that a single player DLC would be nice
---
TBH the lore says they deliberately screwed up the resource distribution among the vaults - it's why in Fallout 2 you find a vault with hundreds of water purification chips everywhere - the original objective of the first Fallout.
---
My guess is that as the vaults here are amongst the oldest you'd be able to find GECKs but in an original, unstable form; not suitcase based, perhaps a rocket just to keep the engine simple? 
---
If you run into other players you should try to trade with them, often people carry weapons they don‚Äôt want 
---
I take tons of workshops and used to give them away when logging off, but for weeks nobody will reply or accept, even travelling to them then offering with a mic won't work. It's sad, to me at least :(
---
That is those special location effects for the cabins in the woods.  I like to thinks its a tribute to the Friday (1,2,3,4) movies.   But if you poke around that location plus go to the other area where scorched are nearby (fort), you find more notes on it.
---
I got your back.....upvoted you and post....I tried too, but I'd have to create 9 more profiles....hey...that's a thought!
---
I guess Bethesda can copy any of the many models out there but I am biased towards the model in The Division. It has a good balance of risk and reward whilst still making your PvE experience fun.
---
I know me dying in PvP will not have a negative effect on my PvE gear and money. Also I can grind PvE bosses over and over for better gear to take into PvP. This helps a lot when you come late to the game like I did. I can grind PvE to get gear to give me a fighting chance in PvP against players with 1000h of play time or more.
---
Four.  Lmao at OP fail; I also noticed the new account.
---
1- for character porting yes you should start with recipes and junk and perk cards, just a level 40 (maybe 50, or 40 but all the perk card picks are available) jumping off point, not one based on what you did in adventure mode. maybe let new players first time start too without having to level in adventure if they had no interest in it at all?
---
Haha I was gonna ask about crashes.
---
Gotta be quick!
---
I play the game now and then with my bro and I‚Äôve just held onto stuff for him while he switched characters real quick. I guess that works too, and safer from crashes.
---
Hell, I don‚Äôt even need the same people across servers, if I could build a thing in a specific area and have that carry over and I‚Äôd get to see new people around the ‚Äútown‚Äù every session I‚Äôd be up for that too. This would be better imo cause I know at least how I myself play the game, longer bursts of a few days and then don‚Äôt touch it for a month. 
---
Oh yeah.
---
That‚Äôs right, bobble heads are stackable... don‚Äôt know how the dupe glitch works but I imagine it‚Äôs an exponential gain.
---
Thanks for answering my q‚Äôs bro :)
---
No problem, welcome.
---
Depends how you look at it, it's negative to you but it was a positive thing for a lot of people. 
---
Really says a lot about you making a comment like that.
---
is there even 5 npcs to pick from?
---
I can get it for 535 caps (vendor price) if you give me the caps i can server hop watoga for you. (only works until level 20 reliably)
---
This isn't a discussion its just using a villain we all know for karma
---
üòÇ
---
I like this idea for friends &amp; clans, would be cool for pvp aswell.
---
use your imagination, people can come up with some pretty creative solutions..
---
Depends on the level of what you are killing
---
While I still believe I am the one who is right in this dispute, I do believe that I could present my points better. I kind of receive the same sets of arguments towards which I already responded several times across different discussions, and my detailed explaination were usually met with insults - Im not surprised quality of my answers detoriated. I also believe that you have put enough care and work into this discussion, that you deserve better. Once I'm on desktop reddit client, I will provide you with a better formulated comments as per why I believe that its not gear but research that its most important factor in why a 'honest even start' is a dream we can aspire to, but cannot possibly achieve without Man-in-Black style memory eraser applied to thoudands of people. Btw. If they gave me choice: port your characters to survival, or start fresh, only be able to trade and exhange loot with those who to started fresh too and get a hardcore gamer achievement that'd let me display something within the game, what would happen would be 'poof, there goes my cavalier set, straight back to RNGesus'. I am really trying to help casuals and not to save my gear.
---
Love it got to keep the game interesting
---
&gt; How is nerfind TSE a lazy nerf? +100% damage per affix is not acceptable.
---
So the nerf they're planning for TSE can't possibly be lazy because the original numbers are no bueno? Maybe I'm expecting too much here but I'm not exactly convinced that a fix can't be lazy if the problem is considered "not acceptable".
---
Either that or I have a lot of money to make offering my "not lazy" "fix" of giving people the middle finger as the answer to everyone's "not acceptable" problems.
---
I HAVENT EVEN SEEN BALLOONS, WHAT IS GOING ON?!
---
No. its materials like lead and nuclear waste.
---
My shower got smashed up once by some dickhead who destroyed EVERYTHING in my camp. I had only built one for other people to use (I regenerate my rad damage and make RadAway like it's boiled water) and felt no need to waste flux rebuilding it after that. 
---
Is it the area you're in? Killed a chicken in Flatwoods to get a level 1 legendary off it even though I was like level 30 something.
---
wanted to make a nice camp one day at not just removing, but placing the stairs was a pain in the ass; after several hours in 2 different days I simply decided to go with a concrete platform and a tent - I'm quite pleased by this setup 
---
Outside the vault, and at random locations around the world. Enjoy :D
---
That would be great thank you
---
I would very much like to have you accompany me on my travels. 
---
My PSN: MrBellyElliot
---
You don‚Äôt want people judging your opinion and yet you judge theirs.  Hypocrite much?
---
When can you be online? I will be in 3 hrs
---
I will punch so much stuff now because of you.
---
Wait what, stealth gives you somekind of bonus other than invisibility?
---
Are you uk time i will be on about 4pm.. which is about 4 hours from now. 
---
Totally. Everyone who makes a sarcastic joke is a hypocrite. Every, single, person.
---
Well the healthbar growing accordingly to the amount of people present without taking into account the level of said people is the mechanic mentionned here.
---
It's a shitty one, granted.
---
Buys an online only game 
---
"Hey where's the singleplayer dlc?" 
---
Im in germany so its the same time for us.
---
&gt; I'm genuinely surprised they haven't done a full wipe yet.
---
They floated that idea around a few times but that buzzkill financial analyst keeps saying that pissing off a large portion of customers that may stop using your service doesn't bode well for revenue projections somehow.
---
Holster your weapon then take it back out, hum should be gone.  Seems to be triggered by having a weapon out during a load screen.
---
Ok awesome my psn name is sybiriya so if you wanna add me 
---
Agree on everything, but survival mode won‚Äôt survive long if they don‚Äôt change legendaries.
---
I would go as far as saying they should completely remove legendaries from the mode.
---
That, along with full drop, will drastically improve
---
the value of craft and boost the economy.
---
Even in passive mode you can get slap damage which is a small sliver of normal damage.
---
Problem is it is not capped. So you pop a bunch of bobble head getting +1000% damage and use a OP weapon with all the right perks and boom you have a situation where where the slap damage is enough to kill you.
---
Just a very poorly planned system that Beth never thought would or could be abused the way it is.
---
What platform is it you play on?
---
Well for one thing, in places like the Forest you're not going to run into anything higher than that. And if a lower level player has been through that area right before you, even if you're out ik n Cranberry Bog, the critters spawned for their level and you're getting what's leftover.
---
Just a reminder to check containers in train station. I for example always leave all my unused ammo, plans and aid in there or give it to low lvl players. I cant use it and dont wanna waste it. 
---
If you think ‚Äúew yuck‚Äù is an example of a sarcastic joke then you really need to visit a comedy club.  Jokes have a setup and a punch line.  You‚Äôve  already voiced your dislike for the game so that eliminates the ‚Äúsarcasm‚Äù element of the comment.  Double fail. 
---
In my opinion, this doesn't work, at least not like this. What you're suggesting requires stable server hosting. Considering most Fallout 76 servers grow unstable the longer the server is open, and the server closes and restarts on occasion, this basically amounts to a co-operative Workshop, and we all know how people generally dislike workshops because of their impermanence.
---
[I had brought this up two days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajywm4/my_thoughts_and_suggestions_on_the_discussion_of/) as an extension of camps and why workshop-ish versions of towns wouldn't work for long outside of player hosted servers. Can someone tell me why people would prefer a workshopified version of this concept over a private campified version?
---
Idk whats up but since a few days my camp is always blocked. I live at twin lakes and i dont understand why. I tried choosing a not so popular spot. 
---
Added :)
---
Maybe keep the fast traveling?
---
I tend to have that effect on people.
---
Only seems to help with the gatlin gun, since it is hand cranked. I guess you can hand-crank it faster with that perk since it boosts your speed with manual things like melee weapons and cranking gatlin guns.
---
This level 76 chased my level 54 ass around hitting me doing serious damage but as soon as I hit him back I was one shot 
---
The budget amount seems to vary a lot depending on both known and unknown variables. I happened to be lucky enough to not have much issue with the limit, i can build a two floor house and decorate it fully and have two turrets. But other people are having major problems. Some speculate it may depend on location and vegetation too.
---
Nah not all jokes. Have you ever actually heard someone say ‚Äúew yuck‚Äù to something like what the first post here said? If your answer is yes, you have difficulty understanding when someone is being sarcastic, which is fine. I do too. I suggest finding a way to help yourself understand it better, or at least to realise that if you don‚Äôt know whether someone is being sarcastic or not then the best course is to either not say anything or to simply ask if it was sarcasm or not. Good day sir.
---
Thanks x
---
I'll pay you to give them to him.
---
Hello there/
---
May not have crashed the server but having 5 nuke sites at once sounds like a bug somewhere along the lines. Or didnt they change silo cooldown times?
---
You alone are in control of your own actions.  Just because you *can* do something, does not mean that it's ok to do something.
---
Or i can do it for free if you have the lever action plan.
---
You got starched genes on?
---
It lasts u TIL you use radaway or a Devon shower without starches genes 
---
I guess the vendor bots...not really many "npcs" to choose from. Vendor bots say some funny shit.
---
"Reminder: Any attempted five finger discounts will be reclaimed and paid for with said fingers."
---
I‚Äôve had red circles stay far longer than intended but the actual area wasn‚Äôt a nuke zone anymore. It seems to happen when I‚Äôve been in the same server for quite some time, several hours at least, which is very rare. Still cool to see 5 circles on the map though. I have a screenshot on my pc somewhere that I‚Äôll try and find.
---
You have to have certain perks in order to make it permanent. Plenty of YouTube vids out there explaining it better then I could. 
---
Yeah, although on the stats menu of the pip boy it has a countdown
---
yeah, map needs expansion with 50+ areas and more locations like whitespring with different enemies.. and towns..
---
there could even be some human settlements that got established and npc's, or just a robot town.. with a purchase-able permanent house (and free spawn location).
---
could easily do it eso style.. 1 location everyone uses but is individual to you when you enter.
---
Thanks man, I shall accept when I get home from work later.
---
You mean the starched genes perk? I have it 
---
HAHAHAHA!
---
Oh a serum has a buff that you don't feel negative affects for an hour. Check yoir stats 2 make sure you still have it on
---
People are still playing them because of the healthy modding communities adding new content (something Bethesda seems to be walking away from).
---
Fallout seems to be having an idntity crisis trying to appeal to too many different audiences but really pleasing none.
---
I picked up my quad prime cb off go in ws
---
Because Todd doesn‚Äôt like you.
---
This might sound harsh but if you are low level, skip the fight. You wont really make a positve impact rather negative.
---
Still better then people afking in a sqb fight.
---
Ps: Im lvl 63 and still i dont do much damage on the sqb even with a TSE Dragon. I feel useless there tbh. 
---
Dude get the hell out of here with your nonsense. Why does what I do matter so much to you? You clearly have issues you can't let something this tiny go and keep responding to something that's has NOTHING to do with you or your life. I can't tell if is hilarious or sad.
---
Fallout 76 definitely needs some kind of a big dlc to spark interest again that‚Äôs for sure. A single player dlc might just be what it would take. Sounds like a great idea to me. I personally stopped playing 76 the second week after release and that idea is probably what it would take to get me and several other Fallout fans to start playing again.
---
Okay gamers, this is epic.
---
Now we just need to find out how the police in this scenario should work, then we can understand the judge, jury and executioners.
---
I‚Äôm getting legs and chest mods from scrapping arm tho lol it only has to be from that set
---
I actually only have four godroll pieces. Two are 100% legit (one is personal drop, other is level 20 and bought from lowlevel who didn't knew its value, but it had just the perfect perk combo I needed -chameleon, cavalier, ap refresh), one is 98% legit - trade was fierce, negotiations long, not something you'd except from people who could just ctrl+v next copy, status of one is not clear to me as the trade went easy but: 1. Its kinda bad for cavalier, better duped same limb pieces are common and 2. Its kinda possible for more than one such items to be rolled as its not super specific roll and 3. I haven't seen it in such amounts as some of the armor pieces I am 100% sure are dupes. In such amounts i.e. I seen it twice and some marine armor perfect pieces I seen dozens of times. I suspect my weapon status aint so good, but honestly, if you think that utilising the maximum currency limit possible in the game to buy a relevant weapon is something which players shouldn't do, shouldn't be able to do, and which makes them bad people who break the game and which makes the game unplayable, then we won't find any common ground.
---
What platform are we talking here?
---
I switch between Xb1 and Ps4
---
Honestly this sounds like a quality addition to an addon/expansion. If it functioned similar to nuke zones it shouldn‚Äôt be too tough to build, but could be used in the same way to provide endgame content especially at levels that are right now somewhat done with current endgame content. 
---
Filthy mutants...  
---
Just you wait, the purge will be upon us soon.
---
Coding a tooltip for it would have taken too much manpower from the atom shop team.
---
Thank God for that, I'd give you a good for the panic attack you just saved me 
---
An area with a buildable plot designated to every player on the map, 1 plot per player, then a few community plots like you mentioned, and the option to buy a commercial plot.  
---
Then CAMPs can just stay the same how tgey are as an actual temporary camp so you dont have to feel so invested in it, or build a nice summer home or just somewhwre else to live if you dont want to live in the town
---
I am on PS4. 
---
Feel free to add me - MrBellyElliot
---
Not showing player names is a great idea! It would make it enjoyable for me (even though I don't plan to play survival) as it would reduce the chance of being bullied by high level characters with god weapons. It would definitely make the game more tense and enjoyable.
---
Omg i wish i had that plan
---
Legendaries have been extremly weird. Sometimes nonlegendary enemies drop legendary loot, sometimes not. Sometimes every second enemy is legendary, but no stars with their name. I got 2 legendaries yesterday from 1 enemy which i never seen.
---
Legendaries are totally bugged atm atleast for me. 
---
I think it could actually work. Maybe have a community store where all team members put up their goods and have an even split of the caps when they end their game. Probably invite solo CAMPers to your town and make it a functioning settlement. They wanted 76 to be about rebuilding right after the bombs dropped, so this could actually work. It would work a lot better if they had servers you could choose from instead of just putting you in a random game.
---
I've been doing something similar to this, I find low levels around the wastes and keep tabs on them whilst wearing chameleon gear.
---
If they get into trouble I help snipe the enemy harrasing them from afar without them knowing I'm helping.
---
I often wonder what's going on in the person's mind I'm helping,  seeing an enemy mysteriously die in front of them with no explanation as to why it's happening lol 
---
I didn‚Äôt want to say this is because all the morons are playing the new COD or similar games... but that kind of is the truth
---
Specifically both together? I don‚Äôt think so. That is a bonus objective so it might give a better random loot drop for completing that option in the quest. 
---
if its kept there needs to be a timer mechanic that keeps you from repeating it often.
---
According to Todd Howard Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt just an online game like all the others. I‚Äôd dare to say a big portion of  Fallout fans had never even played an online game before 76. And with Todd saying things like ‚Äú of course you can play solo ‚Äú it‚Äôs no wonder many gamers expected Fallout 76 to be more like a single player game.
---
You can share any perk card based on your CHR.  Every 3 points allows you to share one star worth of a perk card.  So with 6 CHR you can share a 2 point/star perk.  
---
You don‚Äôt have to be on a team for the card to show as shared.  
---
On PC, it‚Äôs T that toggles it.
---
Any perk can be shared with people your teamed up with as long as you have 3 charisma for every special point the perk card costs.  You dont need to be on a team to decide what perk you will share when you do join one and your choice stays when you log out.  
---
That s very good to know thanks a lot !
---
TIL
---
It‚Äôs so cheap to repair your camp, I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs even worth worrying about?
---
You 100% jave been able to share a perk with your team since BETA.
---
Will do next time I am on!
---
Yet it s the 1st time i see this icon
---
Lol no worries ^^
---
"and you are getting ridiculously hung up a comment on a thread...." OH the irony!!
---
That‚Äôs dumb
---
I've had the same thing happen. The best part was when they put the code in wrong so I just walked over and did it myself. Thankfully I was in pacifist mode cause they immediately started wailing on me. 
---
You have to play for every fraction in different Storylines. 
---
A full wipe kills this game
---
No problem.  It‚Äôs an automatic ‚Äòperk‚Äô that kicks in at 3 CHR.  It becomes very handy for a lot of things, especially crafting early on.  Saves other people from investing in certain cards early.  Later, some special cards, like rad sponge, are OP when shared.
---
they are working on it, i noticed that myself; its theyr reputation at stake and an entire frenchise so im pretty confident they will put effort and even love in this awesome game.
---
No matter what ppl or you tube say, i love this game and i will play as long as it stands
---
Great, but why add them to the Atom shop? It would seem appropriate to make this available free of charge.
---
Your idea is slightly away from technical sides of online games, and that's why:
---
* The thing you call "would be to limit what can be traded/shared" is called **BoE and BoP** items (Bind on Pickup/Equip) and this manner of gear is not applicable to this game, since it's not considered to be a full-scale MMO (24 player max players per server is not MMO, sorry, there should be a full-scale servers for at least 200 players at once). There is no such things as a gear tokens, neither there is a place to get them from (like ~~seriously~~, SBQ only?). And other part of this is that tokens are usually letting you to choose the exact gear you want, so in that case gear is typical McGuffin for the actual game content you need to be ready to go for. 0 spots hit if we talk about Fallout 76.
---
* Factions is a good idea, but I want to see how all of you sitting in queue for a space in the world to match-up some Faction fight. So factions, again, are only good for a MMO games with realms, where there is a LOT of people at once, not 24 max. Otherwise all of your faction would be freeroaming around servers and you would be crying of happiness to encounter some fights in a scale of 4x4 or 5x5. People are literally destroying other non-friends players camps to get their friends on the sever by scaring those off. Factions, ~~seriously~~? 
---
* New character is just a subjective issue for you. Simply because in normal online games, the character is usually a BLANK. That also applied to Fallout 76, and means that character is actually just a mannequin for what you are going to be by using specific weapons, perks and armor. So there is zero reasons for new character, and actually what Bethesda is making with those PVP servers is finally some bright idea.
---
Related....Know what else really sucks is when you load (try to load) into a server that is already having issues. Imaging staring at the loading screen and every ten seconds "Server not responding controls disabled" message pops up IN THE LOADING SCREEN. I'm not even in game yet, how is the server not responding and why did you try to connect me?! Only way out of this is to kill the client through task manager. 
---
They need to put some QoL checks before they load us into a server. Is the server stable, is camp available, is the spawn point bad....
---
Side tale: Then there was the time I spawned 1 seconds before nuke touched down in Watoga. Insta-gibbed, even in PA. That was.... angering. Um, thanks!! a 5-10 seconds invulnerability would be nice when spawning.
---
This would be really handy
---
Slightly similar suggestion, the drug that highlights enemies similar to the perk Boone gave would be a great mutation, it could lower VATS accuracy in return.
---
Sorry your logic is trash. It shouldn't take a preorganized group with minmaxed builds to take down the queen. Should never be that way. Should be possible for 20 people to do it with decent perks/weapons. Not perfect minmaxed perks/weapons.
---
The changes have pretty basic so far though. Mostly just bug fixes. The hardcore servers are probably player requested. 
---
Always nice to read that others are running into nice people.
---
Must be nice lol
---
That seems pretty cool and a realistic and good trade off!
---
I‚Äôm not calling anyone a child , I‚Äôm literally saying children are playing this game and racking up the micro transactions for the company that runs the game  , a tactic Beth seems to be employing!!!  if you like Fortfuck then good on ya!!  I don‚Äôt care ,I‚Äôm just stating  the obvious business model  being adopted by Beth  is garbage !!!! 
---
Do you People realise that this is a work of fiction? 
---
All that experience to repeat the same things everyone has been saying for a week. 
---
Random factoid, the mini gun Arnold used in Terminator 2, was the very same one Jesse Ventura used in the 1st Predator. 
---
Just thought I‚Äôd toss that out there lol. 
---
TOWNS would prevent CAMPs from being able to be relocated to a larger area and would require all members of the TOWN to remain on the same server, hard pass IMO.  
---
That way of thinking is how you never progress.
---
If you only think "someone surely would already have done it", you will never be the first to do anything.
---
Just make sure you turn your mic on to trade. I always get requests and no one ever tells me what they want.
---
Bring back Lucas
---
If they are yet to acknowledge anything then just be patient and wait. Spamming the same post over and over has proven to have no effect. It just clutters up the top rated stuff, people who have genuine posts don't get them seen cos people keep upvote game the same posts over and over. It seems more like a karma farm than a proper effort to suggest something worthwhile.
---
Whilst I agree this T.O.W.N idea is an absolutely fantastic idea, I have already said that in the original post, there is no reason for this one to exist.
---
How about also adding an option to build proper Remotely Accessed Intelligent Droid Expedition &amp; Reconnaissance System in said T.O.W.N.S.?
---
Oh man can we be friends hahah 
---
No, because charcoal is needed to male water filters. But, you should be able to process wood into charcoal, either at the chemists bench or tinker's workbench. Using regular coal is stupid. 
---
Most of them are proximity based
---
Lol I was brotherhood until I got griefed.  Now a bit of retribution is called for Enclave style.
---
I launched at various different areas for a bit as I am tired of the  Whitesprings/SBQ meta. I wanted to switch it up

er no, the analogy is completely bonkers. a thief does not pay the store for his experience for moving things around the store. we're not exactly gaining anything of RL value by duping.
---
ps. i'm not a duper, don't see the point, but it's on bethesda to stop duping, not us.
---
Good, now you can heal ghouls and scorched with it !
---
I'd rather limit destinations. Only able to FT to your camp vault 76 or your friends camp.
---
I'd hate to have to walk 30 min every time I spawn in to meet my friend's who spawn on the other side of the map. 
---
Good stuff. Loved everything.
---
I got it at level 50 and its 45 I swear.
---
Isnt pc cross platform for ps4 and xbox? Lol..
---
Right now each Faction is like a chapter of a book, you're gonna see them all in the story and actually 'join' all of them, Bethesda said in one of their update articles that factions will mean more later but for now it's just the story
---
You can get plans to build 'limb' mods, covering both arms and legs. So arms and legs are a different matter to chest and arms, for example.
---
There's much disagreement on this topic. Let's Just say that!
---
If we‚Äôre going PvE, you might as well use this to bring back NPCs. Appalachia may be destroyed but neighboring areas might not be. Settlers could immigrate to these T.O.W.N.S and each town could have unique themes that unlock after completing each faction. For example, the Mistresses of Mystery could stealth up the area to decrease detection by enemies or the Enclave could add robots to your defense. Just a thought.
---
I don't do invites, because of Lone Wanderer, but I like to help people out. I drop legendaries in containers, tag stuff almost dead, and let other people get a shot in, make armor and weapons for noobs, and leave health items in stashes. I'll help defend workshops or kill problem hordes. But I also don't trust many players, either. Especially people wanting to trade or sending invites from somewhere else on the map. 
---
I was just saying that last night to a 30 friend. I didn't go near till I had a descent melee build to help once she was on the ground at around 60.  Then we walked Whitesprings post Nuke, me Ponting out where the flux was and how they could sell at vendors or craft.  He still managed to shoot a robot and then had to run away lol.
---
My camp loads in layers and it takes me almost 5 minutes to be able to jump haha

Energy weapons are really worth lesa right now. There flashy and can be fun just killing low levrk stuff.. But they suck ao bad...
---
Its a TRAP!
---
i think that Bethesada will A.) fix duping glitch then B.) open up survival which will quickly become a killing ground. where if you die you lose your gear (speculation). This will not eliminate all duped items but could impact the supply of duped items significantly as over powered characters eliminate each other in a blood bath.  Perhaps they will still have the character but have to draw upon their mules to re-arm and rejoin a survival server.  
---
Would be an interesting way to try to rebalance the economy.
---
Personally they should have made dedicated servers for each character you create, that way there is more of a community of players  in each server. Less like just jumping in a random game with random people. In a dedicated server you would see the same players for the most part so random acts of violence would have more repercussions (you would need need to jump to another server and restart a new character in order to have a new community to randomly murder). Plus if others helped you on a mission you are more likely to return the favor. You could also have your base permanently set up in the same spot (as long as someone did not settle there first) and have more or less the same neighbors over time. If a player is an A-hole others would band against them KOS and base leveling until they leave the server, making room for a new player to join. 
---
Like your design!
---
I got rid of my brahmin feeder. Asshole players kept shooting it. Sure the repair cost is negligible but the fact it doesn't flag them as wanted pissed me off. On the flip side it freed up a nice chunk of budget.
---
Report him to betheada cs. He was clearly duping and in violation of the ToS.
---
I've done Mtown nuke 4 or 5 times and I've yet to see a legendary glowing one. 
---
Yeah what about gun powder dude 1000 gunpowder is 50lbs. I spend hours trying to figure out my weight issues and it never makes sense. 
---
Why not do something like /r/ffxiv and their housing system where you buy a plot in an instanced zone, or make the T.O.W.N. instanced like the baseball field in fo4 and people donate caps for the cause and it adds to defenses and quality of the spaces/vendors, etc
---
Killed Queen. No drop. Again.
---
You mean the Atom SHOPS?
---
Love it!  I stopped playing 76 after about twenty hours. Survival will make the world scarier and bring me back. It‚Äôs what this game needs, real PvP. 
---
Yea I guess and some mods I feel like can only be learned from plans no matter how many u scrap right?
---
Hey let‚Äôs not forget about their durability, or we will have to keep leaving the battle to repair the weapons around 3 times, before queen dies. 
---
That's awesome! I've been doing something similar with the lever action rifle ever since the reload was fixed but it's easier to make/scrap. 
---
Yeah I used to think that, now my stash is full and I run around only being able to pick up a few things before I‚Äôm over weight too üòÖ plus I can‚Äôt even use PA yet but I have 2 full sets, 5 chassis and 6 fusion cores stored. No idea what more to throw/give away 
---
 I'm sorry if you can't hang. But to place your inefficiencies in-game would be a disservice to the rest of us. I grinded for my gear and levels. Who weak are you to decide that I shouldn't be able to slaughter people at-will simply because it doesn't adhere to your playstyle? GTA Online has survived and thrived under this very mantra. Before you twist my words, please let me explain. I love Fallout with every last ounce of my breath. This franchise is the only reason I even play video games anymore. I upgraded to a new console jyst to play Fallout 4. I'm willing to accept losing a few items if it means that I can play the way I see fit without being punished. But we all knew what this was going to be coming into it. To expect Bethesda to tailor what was meant to be a violent, online fuck-all experience to the weak while fucking the rest of us over is wrong. They'll have servers which appease the weak, so let the rest of us battle-hardened shitheads to have our fun and stop bitching about it. 
---
I want game companies to just release reseanably polished games instead of releasing gamea that are clearly to buggy to not be in beta or even alpha in aome case's.
---
Really? You can't modify the gun unless you have the garb and amulet that sounds stupid to me when it comes to. game design
---
Anyone else think of the show Kids Next Door when they see all these abbreviations?
---
Somebody datamined it from the files somewhere on here. Some weapon mods you just can't learn from scrapping and I think armour is the same yeah.
---
Actually that post might answer our question for sure too...
---
You need Starched Genes level 2
---
Yea it always has a risk doing it that way, especially when i do it with random friends that i don't know properly. Kinda like secretive, but it is a low chance they are gonna leave at that exact minute that it takes to do it ha! Though, it did happen to me yeaterday with an AA 2 shot gauss i was saving and 30 stable flux of various colours. 
---
Keep a look out for a gold bag with those in haha! 
---
Got one the other day.. Looked at the damge ... Jaw dropped... Scrapped it at nearest work bench.
---
Reminds me of Grand Theft Auto V online. Players spending more in game currency trying to kill you than they get from your bounty or disrupting your biker/ceo/etc missions.  Or getting shot for no perceptible reason like you went to a store to shop and got sniped upon exit minutes after joining a game (sigh).
---
I keep on spawning right in the middle of the river next to my camp.
---
Whenever I come to camp (loading or fast travel, not on foot), it's always under attack by low lever thrash (Forest area).
---
The mobs keep on attacking things they'll never attack "in the wild", I even placed some cheap objects on the perimeter to keep'em distracted.
---
The camp is so damn small - one shack 2x2 with roof, 10 energy power plant for water purifier, every crafting bench, 1 tube, 1 bed, the garden (5-10 of every plantable greens out there), toilet (the distractor), two paintings, clock, little table, stash, chair, fireplace - that's pretty much it, nearly outta budget.
---
Let me decide where to spawn in my camp, make the attacks happening once in a 24h cycle and gimme like 50% budget increase so I could put some lights and a second floor - think this might make me very satisfied.
---
Definitely true.
---
...did you read any of my posts? Anyone who knows the game mechanics can solo it, regardless of how many observers show up to for the loot, even without e/tse's. This game is tailored for casual play, the queen is the closest thing you need some game knowledge, everything else is is literally face tanking and trading shots. This is not even talking about the tryhard setups clearing \~30s. A leisurely solo 8m clear with a non e/tse rifle is very much possible(and present), again irrelevant of how many people show up to watch. 
---
I'm sorry to tell you this sport, but the game is currently set to easy mode, even after the nerf its still on easy mode, without min-maxing, I can toss anyone the control(i'm a console pleb)  to the whatever build I have right now and odds are 1/4(that being generous) will not clear, but in the right hand clears her in \~6m without anyone else having do more than tag her. It's about **knowing the game mechanics**, it's not too particular of the gear when you know what to do, besides just spraying and praying.
---
As was the stash limit increase, and the ‚Äúbulldozer‚Äù solution was a direct result of listening to the community. That‚Äôs just a few things.
---
Btw do u know if light/sturdy/heavy of the same armor set share unlocked mods? Also Canu unlock heavy mods by scrapping light? 
---
Yeah i did the same thing and it eventually corrected, but took forever. I definitely agree with just not opening it til everything loads.
---
I woulda gotten away with it too if it wasn‚Äôt for you meddling assets. Lmao. 
---
Yes. I need screws too
---
No, just no. What a stupid idea.
---
Apart from the obvious griefing opportunity I made my camp in the middle of nowhere. Its why I don't want people to disturb me. Its MY camp, now piss off. 
---
Fucking ballistic fiber. If I could ever have full DR from working armor I'd be unstoppable lol
---
Sometimes the camp will duplicate itself causing this to happen.  It clearly is a Bethesda issue.
---
I get that too on occasion, pretty sure it‚Äôs an issue on their end. When I log out and re-load I often find myself at a destination near where I fast traveled to but not where I had chosen to fast travel to. Eg the other day I fast traveled to the vault and got infinite loading, when I re-logged I was at the shack marker south of the vault instead. 
---
You are correct, luck does not determine drops, it‚Äôs affects the durability of said drops.
---
I prefer to find a spot with water and vegetation near a railroad so I can sell all my junk before I log for the night.
---
I tend to balance it out. If I want to maximise damage with something, it will be done so whilst balancing other perks. "I really want this perk maxed, but my build only allows for 2 stars or I‚Äôll have to take a hit on something else". I have actually cut whole cards out of my build optimising this process, cards that I thought I couldn‚Äôt possibly live without, now I‚Äôve forgotten what they were. The way the perks work in this game really allows for optimisation, if you‚Äôre one hitting everything, it might be time to back off the damage output and see where else you can invest. 
---
That being said, all of my slugger cards are maxed. 
---
I understand that. What I'm saying is there are plenty people out there exploiting the camp building by duplicating or intentionally going over the budget. 
---
You‚Äôd probably have to make it so that as long as one town player is on the entire town player‚Äôs bases all spawn in order to get the most out of this. And I also think that there should be restrictions on where to place towns (we don‚Äôt want a giant complex outside of WhiteSprings that would just get nuked all the time). 
---
Ok I will try it. I can only nuke the mayor of Grafton so many times. 
---
If you‚Äôre going max damage for a specific build max rank all perk cards and use bloody mess, demo expert too if you‚Äôre going for Explosive Weapons. A lot of perks are useless like the carry weight ones. Learn to live without them.
---
The way they are nerfing TS and E will be lazy. Decreasing the DPS of all the weapons, without balancing their base dmg, their durability and the amount of bullets and resources used to craft ammo, let alone the amount of HP SBQ has with 8+ people IS a LAZY NERF. 
---
The overseer left Vault 76 just hours before the rest of the vault dwellers did. I doubt she saw much more than you have.
---
Depends on what you want for your other perks. I went with one one star for all three, plus 3 stars of bloody mess, and one star of adrenaline.
---
I would love if you could my my radium for me. I‚Äôll pay you the materials and whatever you‚Äôre after.
---
 Read my comment. I agree completely. Same concept applies to GTA Online. You knew what it was coming into it. Don't wanna die? Don't play online. There are plenty of other single player games to satiate your appetite. Don't ruin my experience as well, ya bastards. 
---
if you have something like slugger, take all three cards instead of 3 ranks of one card. after you have all three cards you can rank them up from there but more separate cards get you more damage than one higher rank card in total
---
Yep I did exactly this. I scrapped loads of light armour and it unlocked those mods (studded, for example) for light, sturdy and heavy leather armour.  :)
---
PA Plans Mainly 
---
I tend to see that alternate patches are stable. One unstable, one stable,  repeat. 
---
Next patch should be good!
---
The more unique objects you have, the more that means the client/server communications has to maintain.  That‚Äôs why they probably went with what I‚Äôll call the core amount of objects and as they continue to see the patching take care of the hogs (folks who dupe, purposefully crash themselves out of servers, walk around with thousands of pounds of gear). Then they can work on higher limits, more types of gear, etc. as the servers don‚Äôt have to accommodate the idiots who aren‚Äôt helping with crashes and lag.  Not saying that‚Äôs entirely them but it doesn‚Äôt help.
---
I too want far more from this game but until Bethesda gets those glaring holes patched, adjusts their gameplay to more like how players should, and adds to the storyline a bit - then add on what makes sense - your list not being that unreasonable.
---
Best:
---
1. Vendor Bot Wallace
---
2. Rose
---
3. Grahm
---
4. Vendor Bot Phoenix
---
5. The other vendor bots 
---
Worst:
---
1. Sanjay
---
1. SANJAY
---
1. SANJAY HERE
---
&gt;(I'm not a duper, neither I'm trying to defend them.)
---
Sure, yeah...
---
That doesn't make it a 'Bethesda Mystery'. It makes it a You mystery
---
Caravans rolling in from out west, word is there‚Äôs settlements sprouting up out there. 
---
Had this happen to me other day.   Nothing i tried would remove the stairs or floors around it.  
---
So i just moved the camp, it stores a blueprint then i just scrapped the blue print.  
---
I was in the process of rebuilding anyway.  
---
You might get downvoted by the ignorant, but god damn, you are right.
---
That is precisely what I did. Had to throw some;me punches but I'm no longer wanted. Whoo the freedom!
---
The weapon is really good, but please tell me how much shots u do before it breaks ? I did 36. 
---
I found that when I had more that 5, they wouldn‚Äôt produce/hold 2 at a time anymore.
---
That's sounds like Munchkin. (or one of it's many flavors)
---
It's officially a rule, as well as other things like taking a bonus just for using the official app to track your points.
---
It's the philosophy of the game... A munchkin is another name for a min maxer and/or "rules lawyer".... i.e. when you sacrifice role play and immersion for game play advantages or misinterpretations of the rules. That being said, to do that to a new player without sufficient warnings and grace is absolutely dick-ish, and only gonna make someone that isn't going to want to play games with you anymore.
---
The pertinent example being everybody in post-apocalyptic West Virginia has TSEs or why people nuke Whitesprings over and over... it just doesn't make sense in the storyline (sure, you could say that you're trying to end &gt;!the Enclave!&lt;, but really it's just to farm glowing ones and legendaries).
---
Yeah, personally I have not engaged in repeat thread creation but I‚Äôve continued to chime in when someone posts about a thing covered in my feedback post. 
---
What I usually experience is literally (because I timed it) 90 second average loading screens followed by standing around for roughly 60 seconds to ensure the game doesn't lock up because I opened my pipboy too soon.
---
Got bored myself after about the 5th visit to Morgantown - even with lesser spawns, its more efficient doing the loop around Whitespring.  For me now any non prime nuke is mostly just for gathering flux stabilizer mats.  I never wait around for respawns, just do my usual circuit/horseshoe pattern and move on.
---
hold up, pets? i've been away from fo76 for some time.
---
Theres pets now?!
---
Sugar grove 
---
Our visit soon took a turn for the worse when we were arrested for trying to take over a nearby food processing plant.
---
Video games often show what people are like when they think there is no rules or punishment for their actions and weirdly this games number of nice people are slowly giving me hope in humanity (opens twitter) and its gone....
---
BS. Your roof is leaking, and the duper is the one using a garden hose to steal water from your apt's faucet. Is he stealing from you? Kind of. Is he stealing from your landlord? Most definately.
---
Two entirely unrelated things. Duping, is counterfeiting, which is stealing, which isn't justifiable because "Bethesda, waaa".
---
An alternative fix I would propose is just removing the floating health bar on the structures. Since they serve no ingamr purpose other than to trigger us, just remove them. More realistic anyway.
---
I'd be willing to be someone could mod them out. I play with a no nameplates / emote icon mod for immersion and it's 10x better.
---
I was intending to use a Radium rifle as a backup on my future Tesla build.
---
I dont remember exactly, Its an unmarked farm. 
---
Going off memory- If youre looking at the map, theres a large area between morgantown, bolton greens, and mononogah that doesnt have any markers, fast travel to bolton greens and head north, maybe east a little
---
No.  Yes.
---
The story would need to advanced. [With the scorched beasts dead or the scorch vaccine given to all the people moving back in](/spoiler).  But they could add NPC then.
---
Shit, you finally did it! gz dude!
---
I like crafting lvl 10 heavy studded leather armor and leaving it in the places new people will find or if I see one I just run up and hand it to them and they freak out 
---
Yeah I know, and I don't mind. To many Bethesda disciples here, that can't stay objective.
---
I‚Äôve never done a 3 min fight. All my 10 last fights resulted in 20min + duration... 3 with a fail. It seems like without a TSE it would be way worst. In my last fight I had to repair my equip twice before we put it down (one minute before the time run out).
---
Agree with most of it however map is to vast whithout fast travel. No name tags on map should be applied as well to adventure mode
---
They said they will try to release at the end of month, so maybe they will or maybe next week.
---
i saw this video earlier and i just think its amazing that someone out there is using their time trying to find the next whitesprings and fissure site prime. #falloutsgreat
---
As far as anyone knows: The rate of production at your camp is a constant regardless of how many machines you have.  More machines just increase the maximum you can have sitting around before they are retrieved.  This would also explain why public workshops have a water rating.
---
Just a shame you wouldn't be able to scrap it.
---
kinda sounds like you are though. otherwise why bother even posting this. it is against the ToS in every online game. Its wrong to dupe and or utilize exploits.
---
The central markets in EVE are all public, as in everybody can buy/sell there. Monopolies do not happen by controlling who can sell there but by controlling the raw resources at the source (hello OTEC) or using vast amounts of capital to simply buy out a share (read, everything of a particular item) of the market to be the single supplier at a higher price level until supply removes the advantage again. 
---
I'm level 414. I had a server to myself the other night and nuked the queen to see if I could solo it. 
---
I use a vampires explosive combat rifle, a TSE pump action and a bloodied explosive double barrel. 
---
It took me 16 minutes, most of it was add control. All of my damage on her was in a few phases when most mobs where dead. 
---
The issue I see is that no one has a clue how to use their weapons properly. Cripple her limbs, then get in close. Shotgunners shoot under her belly. Riflers get close and shoot her belly or face. 
---
What I would LOVE for lower level people to do is cripple the queen. Then you're being useful. 
---
I mean, there *are* NPC's in the game...just not human ones.
---
Well maybe you people shouldn't have bought those duped weapons.
---
love the sloped roof idea using the half walls to make a larger sloped roof 100% going to use that next time I move - I swear I love the builds in this game as it makes me want to push myself into creating something better each time I design a new place 
---
It was probably explicitly explained somewhere and i just happened to miss it
---
Okay . But light/sturdy/heavy does not share mods right?
---
you know what I'm willing to stay in denial at that point 
---
sounds like you should report them. also ya they were making the small square building then using it to clip them through the rock face.
---
Doing research that level 8 you bring with is why the queen has low health.  So you're abusing a glitched game mechanic.
---
I play mostly solo and feel I have to max damage to be able to fight the biggest monsters. Taking down a scorchedbeast with a non godly rifle is not trivial. Same if you wanna farm nuked whitesprings or do anything involving multiple fast enemies. Damn I just descibed half of Fallout 76! Get all the ranks buddy!
---
I mean. The Chinese tried it, too
---
I very much look forward to it!
---
I'm assuming you dont?
---
Ah, my friend started dragging me through White Springs at level 17ish. I made it to level 50 in 2 days of play time. Plus gaining mutations in that time. 
---
So then I must be the odd ball out. Lol. I'm slowly chipping away at the beginning story. 
---
If youre on ps4 id take it gladly
---
or at least add a ghost mode that you don't take damage or can be seen until you move that way we could let everything load before entering the game 
---
I used to wear the x01 targeting HUD as well. I had many CTDs, especially around nuked Whitespring.
---
Switched to another mod and now i barely (and then only before or after fasttravel) crash to desktop.
---
Platform is PC
---
Well, this explains why I got vaporized while trying to help Steelheart.
---
What ektenia said.  Personally I find 4 to be the sweet spot for me.
---
Yes!
---
Probably Really Obscene, But Let'Em Man
---
me and a friend built some camps near each other and was a bit disappointed how far we were apart and it made the game a bit annoying that even in a team we couldn't build close 
---
Maybe the game is just too broken because of Bethesda and people should not just play this game hoping their ig experience won't be messed up by cheaters. In other words : just make yourself a favor if you can't bear cheaters,  play an other multplayer game that is well developed. Not a game like fo76 that is  so flawed and broken,  it became a freaking sandbox/playground for cheaters. I mean Bethesda purposely sold you a totally broken system... If you buy a Mercedes car but it gets stolen because it has well known major built in security flaws and you even can't properly lock it... Would you be mad about the thief? or about yourself for buying this broken car and about Mercedes for producing these pieces of crap? 
---
You can sell up to 1400 caps worth of stuff to a vendor every day. I've never really had an issue with it, sure I'd like more caps, but with the cap limit being 25k per character it doesn't take long to hit it when playing.
---
Sadly, caps are almost worthless in trading because of duping anyways, people sitting with 500k+ nuka colas and what not. Should be interesting to see what they do moving forward.
---
I'll gladly take your junk and shotgun shells if you're on pc
---
U may be correct. Been testing and no difference with 4 or 15.  Time to start scrapping 
---
that is why I want them to have new characters since then they wouldn't come to pve side to farm for things to nuke people on pvp side 
---
I kill people and raid. but I have no interest in your junk. 
---
Not a problem. I can understand your frustration especially with the latest patch nerfing XP it‚Äôs even slower now to level. It was hard doing a second play-through so I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing a third. I hope it‚Äôs third time lucky for you. 100% agree, the support is useless and simply tell you to start again üòë
---
I think they need to set the queen to a certain hp/armor amount.
---
We should be happy to have as much extra damage as we can get to show up.  Not resenting all the suboptimal damage dealers because they can't pull their weight.
---
And yeah, as many times as I've been the only one moving her hp bar, there's fonna be a lot more failed queen attempts thanks to people showing up that aren't able to do enough damage.
---
I've also been one shot (multiple times) with pacifist on and without owning a workshop, being wanted or being in a team. I'm not sure it had anything to do with bobble heads or there are some other bugs at work though. Two of the times I was killed fast travelling into Watoga by a spawn campers. I had been there before on that server so it's unlikely but possible it was just the laggy loading time.  
---
Also, slap can't max at 5 points. I had 2 low level players beating on me last night and it was doing about 5% with each hit. Not enough to kill me but enough to make me use stimpak's.
---
Nah fuck that, fighting outside nuke zone is great.  
---
TSE nerf will just cause people to run a bloody melee build or junkie build, killing queen will slightly be slower. 
---
Only time I‚Äôll be down to run queen in a nuke zone is if 24+ high level players do a free for all match with their camps  just outside the nuke zone while a queen is flying around.
---
 Last camp standing wins, bonus if queen dies.
---
Every goddamn day. I don't even bother anymore bc I know I have to pick up all 3 data tapes, go get the holotape from the trailer, read the diary, go pick up the password, and come back to do it. 
---
&gt;Average Fo76 player or "casual" have nothing to lose, most of the playerbase don't even know about trading subs, most have for equipements only what they've looted. Knowing god rolls are supposed to be extremely rare (getting a 3\* TSE Handmade has a chance of 1:2,000,000 or so), it is safe to assume average players are far away from the meta.
---
I do believe they might loose all the progress they have and be exposed to people who organised their time around release of PvP mode, entering the game full of sharks completely naked, and often alone. I, on the other hand, have nothing to loose. I will be having best gear in the market since when the game started spawning loot, even if I wouldn't even pick such crap up right now. 
---
&gt;On the other hand, "our bunch" have top tier weapons &amp; armors because people massively dupped and sold god rolls, said gears we won't be able to recover once dupe is fixed because of how scarce they are. We have everything to lose vs the average joe Fo76 player.
---
I also believe that while I have more than the average joe, I will loose less if we all start fresh. I was fighting those TSE guys way before I started trading with only my perks, and I will not be farming items alone, I will be farming them in group that has their collective builds planned around being able to use different weapons and share unwanted godrolls.
---
&gt;Well that's too bad because what makes a good &amp; enjoyable PvP to as many people as it is possible is balance, fairness &amp; rightness.
---
I want a PvP system in which everybody can join, make initial mistakes, ask questions, easily fix major mistakes, become competetive, and start gathering decent equipment. Whoopsie, I got it now, last time my workshop was attacked by two PA wearing guys, they asked me how are such results possible. After short lesson, it turned out the now stood a chance when I tested them further. My point regarding "fair or just" is that its an emotion about what behavior you think should be awarded in a simulator game which revolves around humanity learning nothing and dooming others all over again, finalized by a collective suicide, in their own greed. I think we shouldn't base game decisions on emotions, but on end results. End results of putting unarmed kittens into shark aquarium will be terrible even if you break all the sharks teeth. They regrow fast. Please don't take the kittens claws away as part of your crusade for justice.

&gt;Then understand that casuals will be hightly disadvantaged because YOU, I and all other people who feel entitled to their overpowered weapons, which +90% were duplicated, will roam in the same servers that average joes with shite gears that did not took advantage of dupe exploits to some extent.
---
If the game enables you to have a choice to port the characters to survival, or to forever lock them in adventure and give you next slots for survival, also giving you something to show off your move, then I will do that. I don't consider myself entitled to my gear. I am trying to be the voice of reason in a topic where emotion rules, which is hard.
---
&gt;Making everyone fresh start is the first step to have happy casuals that will be hooked to the game and eventually become competitors.
---
Until they leave Vault 76.
---
&gt;Placing our fellow casuals in a pool with overpowered gods who own OHKO weapons and their armors that make them impervious to dmg would just make them straight up quit survival and make them rather stay in "PvE".
---
Nobody serious about PvP lacks OHKO weapons or is easily OHKOed by any TSE. Those people tend to complain that some jackass ruins their PvE experience, and are complaining its even online. Survival mode is something that makes them join the discussion by saying they don't give a shit about survival and calling all PvPers griefers. Those who put their pacifist off, or keep it off all the time, all have a decent weapon. Those who know how to shoot don't need anything else, and since its not a shooter, but an RPG-style-shooter, its not only about aiming, but also about math.  
---
&gt;!The whole premise that its the gear that puts the casual at disadvantage and that starting fresh without duping would make casual lives easier is utterly and completely based on fantasy.!&lt;  
---
I don't like the current market, the RNGesus, and the duping crisis. What I would like would be legendary crafting, so that anybody could reliable expect almost perfect gear within reliable time investment, and count on RNG only to upgrade from "almost perfect" to "couldn't be better", like cavalier+int to cavalier+ap refresh. But we are where we are, I doubt this happens soon, I doubt survival will be without legendary mods, so simply allowing to jump between the worlds is the least bad solution.  
---
For me it boils down to if we want this to be decided upon emotions, or calculations, and calculations are simple - in fresh start environment with open PvP, initial advantage of hardcore gamers will be considerable, and conditions of gaining power as a lone wanderer who's now suddenly unable to easily enter best farming spots will be punishment for casuals, not for hardcore games. And me using word hardcore ain't something to brag about, ffs, it's just the simplest way to say "I am okay with taking three holidays, two for gaming, one for sleeping, which I do believe is enough to put me and my bunch at such advantage that more casual gaming later on is enough to remain on top, and which is not really something most people have time to do".
---
They are already focusing to the new games. Only few devs are working with FO76 anymore so they aren't doing any major updates to the game. They just do minimum necessary fixes so people can't sue them from selling total garbage.
---
Tesla is pretty good in some sort figts. Like in whitespring.
---
Ah I should of said yes I am ps4 - id?
---
Sorry should have written ps4
---
Has anyone actually counted the desk fans there? I think it's around 10 but sometimes they've already been looted and you have to relog a couple of times until they spawn.
---
The longer the game goes on and the good players leave you are eventually left with just try hard assholes abusing bounty mechanics, etc.
---
Yep
---
Just means you get more per hour. I've got 3 and plenty of purified water. Course I'm using an industrial ones.
---
seems like legendary drop process uses the same system like csgo case drop. 
---
you have tier one drop (wood, drill, crap stuff) \*common\*
---
tier two (melee, shitty armor) \*rare\* 
---
and tier three drop (cool weapons with 1 or multile stars) \*epic rare\*
---
btw if they will remove all the shitty  stuff, so what will be the point of farming legendaries if all drop will be good?
---
This guy survives.
---
Hey, that‚Äôs a good idea. They should give us working fridges instead. Really support the realism factor.
---
What about the thumbs up or the heart emojis
---
When the duper is on the roof hitting it with a sledge hammer. Yea it is their fault. 
---
You gonna flock to 76 from the Savage Divide in 3 minutes without FT?
---
Ok I honestly can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs from real life or the game ü§£ü§£ if it‚Äôs real life..then they did a damn good job on the aesthetics of the game. 
---
That is not really an exploit though, as it is really hard avoiding glowing ones.
---
GodRoll for me would be Vangaurd Sentinel Limbs and a Dense Combat Chest.  With Fireproof perk and dense your explosive DMG is negated, leaving only the two shot ballistic DMG.  
---
If your total DMG is around 600 the TS ballistic is only around 150-180(like my TSE Handmade). With 4 pcs Vangaurd giving around 50-100 DR/ea(depending on armor base DR) plus the DR of Dense piece your gun would be a gnat bothering Chally Moo Moo.  
---
That's if I'm moving.  
---
If I'm standing still aiming you're just screwed.
---
We know the current player pool is "contaminated" either by duping or buying duped items, no way to identify said duped items or isolate violators, whoever has duped items will stand mountains above the rest, either in theoretical caps(+1m cola's) or mats (+1m lbs of junk). 
---
The wipe will kill off the players who are on their way out, but would they have bought any atoms anyways? To compensate for the near free fall drop-off you'd have to entice players back in, a less entitled community than the one we currently have would be nice. f2p is unlikely but would draw in a wider demographic, because even at ‚Ç¨10, this game hasn't seen a bump in player count since release.  All I really want is the long term player base to stay alive, because player interactions are endgame content, and has lasted(me) for over +600hr. 
---
&gt;I am more surprised they haven't rushed bug fixes and content quicker
---
\-jpwns93
---
They did rush out some content: Survival(pvp) server, and do you recall what our humble community did? They bashed it, hard, they give us a bone and that is how we acted, which for me reinforces that the current player base is full of entitled...people, and would welcome a wash. Until then I'll keep doing queen runs and leaving her at a \~10% to watch the groupies struggle while I farm the mobs for 20m.
---
Playing Anthem until survival mode comes out in march.  Content is coming in slow we paid for a game full price with only like 30% of content released so far. 
---
I think there needs to be a large cool down for character and sever switching. 
---
My Psn is XmadredzX. Im currently at work ill be home at 2pm est
---
Hey OP if your bank stored your money on the side walk and some one stole it would you be mad at the thief or the bank?
---
Having same issue
---
Server switching no. That would really hurt the game. Unless the game gets some extreme fixes to the social system, etc a server switching cool down would kill it.
---
Four leaf clover is great for building crits. 
---
Also lower the weapon weight the less ap each vats shot hits. 
---
Also agility is the root stat for calculating AP pool. 
---
And Luck determines how quickly crit meter fills. 
---
come shredding with me and you might be surprised my friend ;)
---
Scammers, the correct name for them is scammers.
---
So is this why my hunting rifle now does absolutely zero damage? Doesn‚Äôt even register a hit marker.
---
I need screw gears and other junk for the excavators power armour. 
---
Duper CJ spotted
---
Yes I feel ya and I have experienced the same when I first started. Although check out fallout 76 wiki there are 7 different vendor fictions only vendor from same fiction share max 200cap (refresh every 20hrs from the moment u sell something). Also instead of hoarding stuff weight a lot try sell smart. Bulk junk like aluminum, adhesive weight less and sells a lot almost as good as player trading. Also check/post on fallout76 market subreddit if u want sell item u hoarding to others need it.
---
I guess later in game is not that much of a problem but right now I have only two vendors to sell to because of factions. It sucks that rest of us are being punished for duping.
---
Guns should get the same boost to damage like how str boosts its damage 
---
I know some people will say - but that doesn't make sense - sure it does the character just fires more accurately so when he hits them its a more vital spot just like they add it in so many other styles of games 
---
at 15 points str boosts melee by 80% (I think running numbers off of a wiki) so if perception added Half that number to ranged weapons it would give them a lot more stopping power against bullet sponges but still make melee a major hitter 
---
Rifles should get a boost from perception / heavy weapons a mix of perception and str (cause holding the gun stable) - energy weapons should be int based giving people a reason to use them if they are crafters and such ect ect
---
You've put a lot of thought into this. Here's my argument. If you're being a dick, just admit you're being a dick. You be you, man. Go be a dick. But don't pretend that because the game lets you be a dick, that you're not a dick.
---
Fast traveling as it is ruins player interaction IMO. So many times I've gone after a bounty person or went towards players to rp/interact, but when I get near I find out they just teleported away. It breaks my immersion big time and makes it so hard to have any type of interaction. I do wish train stations were fast travel hubs as they go all over the map and it would make sense.
---
Almost all harvestable plants are mutated versions, no? 
---
Or ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù. 
---
Trying to tell me I can carry 400lbs of crap but can‚Äôt hold a gun still huh. 
---
I have camped on his route and valiantly searched for him the past few months. Havent seen him at all. The last time I did, i was in a random team and the kid shot at him.. .starting to wonder if hes holding a grudge....
---
If you're on ps4 you can have my excavator armour
---
Lol. So if someone, knowing full well they are committing a crime, finds and exploits a hole in a piece of software, the designer of the software should be punished and the exploiter should be lauded by a community of cheating douchebags? You should be a criminal defense lawyer!
---
Moo gets it.
---
How about if you get wanted, theres a cool down for switching servers.
---
GECK'ing a nuke zone would be fun xD
---
It's for the quest. So doubt I could take your armour without crafting it to move on to the next bit. 
---
Update: cleared DNS cache and cycled my router, that seemed to get it back into reasonable territory.
---
And ye I'm on ps4
---
It is per workshop. Stick 3 at each workshop you take. Have drained vendors with just purified water. 
---
Order of mysteries was fun and had some weapons that were decent for low levels.
---
What's your psn and are you on now?
---
I had trouble with a hunting rifle equipped with Scorch Killers too, but it was just a regular hunting no other effects. I think this is only for the Hunting Rifle because I equipped a shotgun with it and that was hitting things fine. I figured they fixed this bug, damn. Sorry it happened to you too
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 I‚Äôll take any ammo you have and unused plans 
---
Darkvampireking and Ye I'm on now 
---
I'm that kind of player that goes through the game really slowly checking almost every nook and cranny and so far I have discovered only two factions of vendors so my daily cap is only 400 caps which is nothing for this kind of gameplay. Thanks for the advice I will definitely check it out. 
---
The issue is that "instantly killing the legendaries" means other players aren't getting in at least one hit on the legendary, which they need to do to get loot drops. 
---
ok, so screws, as everyone has said, Sugar Grove is your god. You can get everything there, screws, springs, lead, bottles for molotovs, metal from the robots, circuits etc. The next best places are any office buildings, so downtown Charleston etc. Morgantown  and Watoga Schools both have a bunch of them. One huge eye opener for me was realising portable fuel tanks ( the red and yellow/orange ones) also contain 1 screw each as I had oil tagged for search too and assumed that's why they were showing up for me.  
---
Mob wise - wendigos drop screws but don't have super reliable spawn points, same with megasloths but both are well worth hunting down as they drop other valuable mats you can trade back against the vendors.
---
Bobblehead and/or magazine stacking.
---
Its called Advanced Power Connectors, vendors on the east side have a decent chance for selling them.
---
At the very least I'd like #3.  The ability to simply change into the Hazmat without having to go thru and re-equip everything like we can with the Power Armors.
---
I think we need dedicated area roaming npc vendors like moo moo and her master.  They should change up their available inventory, cap limit, cap reset timer, one-liners, etc every month or whenever.
---
Click on "Categories," then "Hide All," then add and delete icons at will. 
---
I don't even care. I've stood and watched as mine was partially destroyed, calmly conveying in voice chat it's so cheap to fix every single thing, that I really care and I hope they get whatever they were after out of the experience (other than rage from me), lol. I have a large base as well, but it's still incredibly cheap to repair it all if needed.
---
I guess I deserve it. It was a CAMP scarecrow :(
---
Not if you place the switch inside the area you want to keep locked
---
Yes. I been there I know how it is. But I still highly suggest u to join someone‚Äôs party and fast travel to high level place with different vendor faction cuz the vender there sells useful plans/mods if u have extra cap buy something it replenishes the cap a little bit
---
oh, right! post deleted :D
---
Cool, thanks man.
---
It never seems to lag. The one time it did it said ‚Äúserver stopped responding‚Äù like 4 times in 20 seconds then crazy lag. So we hopped servers. 
---
Interesting. Do you mean something like perma-wanted status (for that character, or account)?
---
I mean, I kinda like this, but if it's just for that character, wouldn't they just make a dup-mule?
---
For sure, check my post in the selling subs and we can get that Radium purring!
---
They duplicated bobbleheads by the thousands like an explosive buff then consumed probably like 50+ of them in a few seconds and the effects stacked. They then can do not just thousands of damage but potentially millions as the effects stack and exponentially multiply your damage. 
---
I've added you
---
Gonna test with 4 industrial
---
Dude who made the video, said in the video, that WS was better. Stop creating click bait titles.
---
Nice! always great to meet people looking at "alternative" builds!
---
I agree completely. It's even cheap for casuals. Everyone I've had any conversations with in the game all keep mostly junk in their stash anyhow, so just pull it out and done. The only exception for some may be the decontamination showers. Those could be a bit frustrating if you don't have any flux lying around and/or have a hard time finding a seller on m76.
---
like every gaming company these days.
---
What a dumb comment
---
I've been in Whitespring more recently and I can say I have never seen a Nuke drop there...... I've never dropped a Nuke so not even sure if that's a good spot or not.
---
Well there isn't any dialogue to be had with any and you don't get the development you got in other fallout titles with NPCs. Human or not. 
---
Seems like when u have over 5 its just spreads the water between machines
---
As a raider with a base that can't be broken into this wouldn't work. Also buddy and I racked up huge almost 5k bounty and posted on lfg 3 times before someone could claim it and they only killed him abusing bobbleheads(I watched him kill over 50 people only for us both to be downed by a level 15 with a bobble boosted low level TSE)
---
Same thing here.  2 kills last night 2 different servers, 0 loot.  Inventory has weight but no items to be found.  And then on another server the health bar was not even moving and there were about 20 people just unloading on it.  Had to abandon that server and move on.  What a waste of ammo, time and caps!  But just like the rest of you I will be back tonight for more (or less), so I guess we are all crazy!
---
Makes fees the people a bit harder
---
This is what I was thinking but couldn't articulate. 
---
The legendary system was a missaaaaaaaake. Some dragon ball Z shit, broke pvp armor vs broken bobble heads
---
Heavy weapons could have an innate multiplier against large enemies and bosses. That way you get an incentive to use them to take out big enemies, which is what I personally think they should be best at.
---
They should make a 10 point endurance card that provides 10% immunity per level. At 10 ranks your immune. Give players and option but also make it have a cost that is more than just another piece of cosmetics.
---
I feel this has been known since beta, but everyone jumped on Whitesprings train and refused to get off.
---
Yeah boi, as I unlocked that final mod a tear ran down my craggy features.   
---
No more "where's Chop?" - "He's meeting some weird, bald raider to buy junk for radiums"
---
Maybe i'll become a Finder, locating junk for punks.
---
The max they can hold is based on the unit.  The simple purifier you can place on the ground holds 2 max.  Industrial unit in the water holds 5 max.  I've not used the rest, as I never needed them.
---
The main benefit to making more units is to have more storage room.  Allowing you to get more waters per trip back to your CAMP without having to babysit.
---
I have 5 ground units at my CAMP.  Allowing me to hold 10 purified waters per trip back to CAMP.
---
It's real. I took a bunch of pics.
---
Only if you use a Radium!
---
Has happened to me a few times as well. 
---
Time to pursue the gamma gun.
---
Cripple the wings.
---
Side note: How do you know when you've crippled? When she flys low?
---
You absolutely don't need explosive type weapons to deal with the SBQ.  But post TSEs, I wonder how non heavy gunner/melee builds will adjust for this.  Never had a TSE and been to many fights, I can tell I'm contributing but my build is combined PA/heavy gunner/melee.
---
Heavy gunners can dish out the damage over time it takes to bring her down.  I've gradually adjusted my setup for queen fights.  Primary tools are a Furious 1\* gatling gun and lv 50 All Rise.  I have a backup gatling gun and some other melee weapons in case either one breaks during the fight.
---
Since its a combo setup, my Heavy Gunner perks are not fully maxed out either, they do additional 45%, Slugger perks contribute extra 30% (all lv 1).  Prime receiver was a very recent add but it was fine before too (used Speedy receiver previously).  Pop Psychobuffs/Psychotats as needed during the fight.  I have backup gatling and some other melee weapons in case either one breaks during the fight.
---
# Key Perks
---
**Strength 15** \- with Heavy Gunner 3, Expert Heavy Gunner 2, Master Heavy Gunner 1, Incisor 3, Martial Artist 3, Slugger 1, Expert Slugger 1, Master Slugger 1.
---
**Other Perks** \- Tenderizer 1, Suppressor 3, Adrenaline 1, Bloody Mess 3, Stabilized 3, One Gun Army 3.
---
Almost want to swap out the Slugger entirely and go full heavy gunner for the fight, just that the ultracite ammo drain in the slower SBQ fights might be less economical than switching to melee when she lands.
---
Honestly! A stabilized mod would be sweet
---
I feel ya. Lost so many calibrated shocks 
---
How are the rest of us punished? Also the only vendor you need access to is the Enclave. My run consists of Flatwoods, Raider Train Station to the right of Flatwoods, Whitesprings, Whitesprings Bunker (Enclave), Watoga Station, Brotherhood Phenix Bot located in Watoga, and then Harpers Ferry. That‚Äôs 1,400 right there, then if you find Grahm 1,600. So daily you can technically get to that much a day as long as you find Grahm and have access to the Bunker. It‚Äôs a pretty easy run. I sneaked my way through Watoga plenty of times before I knew you could keep them off your back.
---
They are fixing it next patch
---
Agreed with all except no fast travel. Have you ever actually tried walking just ONCE from one side of map to other and back? It would be completely impractical especially since some resources can only be found in some areas, as well as quests designed with the fast travel system in mind.
---
If you cannot use power armor, you really shouldn't store more than one chassis. There you go. I just saved you between 28 and 40 weight. Weight management is enough work without storing extra chassis. 
---
That's my best option so far to quickly discover all or most of the factions. And I've been buying stuff to replenish caps.
---
Thankfully they are opening survival servers soon and hopefully they leave us adventurers pacifists in peace
---
What were the perks you needed to tame them because all I have is animal friend, do you need wasteland wanderer or whatever it is?
---
All of them?
---
It's more like a thief blaming a store that even after a dozen thefts, still leaves all its expensive items outside, unsupervised. Sure dupers are dicks, but at a certain point the blame starts to fall on bethesda. If there's an exploit, it'll be exploited, and the longer it's there the louder the sirens song becomes. Bethesda should have patched this as soon as possible, not waiting until the set patch dates. 
---
No but my across the street neighbor from Maine let me know there is this really cool Pet Sematary nearby.
---
Congrats from someone on this quest too! I got an "explosive anti-ghoul -33% VATS cost " one and decided to mod it (well anti-ghoul is a joke since ghous are healed by rads). It is the only worth smth legendary rifle i got (I was extremly unlucky with rifle drops) and decided that ok, gonne craft some. Little did I know of its scrap-learning rate. Two weeks into it and I have neither got the elusive supressor or hardened reciever on it. Therefore I do have a question to you:
---
\- is it better to craft-srap at one big session or it does not matter? I craft-scrap em as I loot enough screws, as they are the bottleneck here, to keep inventory low.
---
\- how to cope with depression?
---
Is he heavy?
---
You can find the plans at the Pioneer Scout Camp, always spawns at one spot there. 
---
As well as being neutralised its also most likely a different strain of fev to the mariposa Fev-II strain resulting in a different variation of super mutant.
---
Graham shares caps with the Watoga Station vendor, so does the wandering vendor bot, so you're still capped at 1400 a day. Everything else is good advice and pretty much what I do as well.
---
Yeah this game is built around fast travel. Hell I still get the glitch where if I'm over encumbered it will only let me spawn sometimes very far away.
---
Nah, but I play one on TV. 
---
I got deep pocketed armor, no worries
---
i‚Äôve been restricting myself from buying a single mod until they fix that bug because i already started putting the mods on armor pieces and keeping those in my stash so they wouldnt get scrapped but it started to take up so much space that now i‚Äôm just waiting.. i even put the power armor pieces on frames but i already have 6 frames in my stash and going through them just to get my excavator armor so i can fix it is bad enough by itself
---
It‚Äôs worth it. 1200 caps and 400 makes huge difference plus vender in high level place has rare plan/mod ppl looking for u can buy them to sell if u have the time to server hop
---
I can only assume its pure RNG and you could get shielded plans at any time.
---
It did work for me on a previous character.  But then again they were dropping legendary items then too- not the mess that they are now.
---
üíÄ Lmao!
---
Weird. No idea. I mean sometimes you just gotta poop.
---
I have not missed your kind. Creepy zealots
---
Fallout 76 in one image! https://i.imgur.com/c95qpaM.png

Seems someone got ahold of the experimental RobCo Wing Freeze Serum. Found some paperwork at a factory that suggested it worked by causing paralysis in the target, within moments of the injection. Guess someone needed ammo, had scavenged the serum; had a syringer handy. Apparently, that old serum works! I wonder how far into the testing phase it had made it before the Fallout.
---
Oh, alright then. But doesn‚Äôt the bot share with the Responders?
---
I've run it 4 times. T-60 Servo plans 4 times, Heavy combat armor leg (actual object, not plan) once. I'm there for PA plans. :/
---
If you use the serum (with Starched genes off), then you get the mutation permanently (by keeping starched genes on thereafter), and for the first two hours, the negative effects of the new mutations are suppressed. 
---
It's not even that hard to get decent rad resistance on a budget. The broken hazmat suit is what level 15 and has the same hidden rad resist factor as the normal suit, beyond that an empty power armor frame comes with the power armor invisible multiplier, and it's not like rad-x and diluted are rare, as well as rad away and stuff.
---
The adds are more of a gate, but even then you can just run back and forth past a high level player and dump all the aggro on them.
---
SBQ is supposed to be an endgame fight/boss and not something you do within 5mins with ridicoulsy high powered weapons.
---
Make it as hard as it should be Bethesda. 
---
I think that Hazmat suits should be moddable. They can't even come out with atom shop skins for them right now. Even if you had a set up like underarmors with four different levels, any moddability is good.
---
It should also be possible to go into a nuke zone without a hazmat suit or power armor as long as you stack enough rad resistance. You can use Rad X, Diluted X, and Rad Shield and still die out their with your measly +25 armor resist that doesn't stack.
---
They also need to BUFF the base power armor resistance. Doesn't make sense that Hazmat suits even when torn and patched up negate more than a set of T-51. Is it not sealed properly?
---
I agree. I run empath; when I'm squad up with my one buddy he's literally unkillable without bobble glitching (or if he just stood there and let you attack I suppose). We get told literally every day we are being reported for cheating but he just has all legendary ass/sent and a  great setup. He's never once duped or helped a duper either, but his build is the definition of broken.
---
Well if they have a cap of only 200 caps on each faction and an overall cap of 25k per character so players who are duping are somewhat limited then the rest of are being punished, but maybe that's not the case and it was designed this way to limit us with our ammo and junk. Whatever the case I will be forced to join with some high level players to fast travel to other factions.
---
Legend has it that one who punches ALL the scarecrows will be freed from his misery.
---
It‚Äôs a great experience for new players as well!
---
It's still not foolproof. Two out of the last four times I've done the AWOL Armaments event the final 3-star legendary mob did not drop a legendary for me, and I always let it heal up to full after it gets below 50% health.
---
I'm hoping coming patches will make the legendary loot system a bit more robust so that we won't need to have this kind of discussion, since clearly it's not working as expected all the time.
---
You played DayZ etc.. Really ? And what do you do about legendaries effects wich make you invisible ? What do you do about x2 damage while crounched ? What do you do with SVAV automatic aim, did you really played ARMA and DAYZ ? If yes, you know People LOVE camping, so we need things to avoid that, the solution is what I said. :)
---
Harpers Ferry there‚Äôs a little wedge in the wall near the front. Leads you right to the vendor without anything on you. Watoga, you might need an escort but you can just sneak in then run away if caught.
---
Good try, but a hard negative. Her function is useful but not vital, since they don't/can't launch doesn't work like that. Nore would that arrangement work when we load into a nuked map with a live queen. Be a little more creative  rather than crying exploits and glitches. Without any external assistance, still consistent sub 6m runs solo's. I'll give you a fat hint, it's about  heals and healing. 
---
 Jesus think about it, if she spawned at low health then everyone on the map could do "high damage", I leave her at 10%  and farm the mobs for 20m while the groupies struggle to kill the queen, so that can't be the case.  I would advise you to read what perks compliment each other and **again** get familiar with the game mechanics.
---
Early in the game keep a weapon for each type of ammo you have.  Tag Lead in junk so you know to keep anything with Lead (tin cans are perfect) you need to make ammo for the most part (most ballistic is lead, gunpowder and steal). 
---
But Survival will be a separate game mode entirely... these aren't suggestions for the base game
---
I've been unlucky. I usually run into the "raider" types, which has turned me and my playstyle into the old grumpy man who hates people lol
---
It helps to have lvl 3 luck of the draw and weapon artisan when you repair it. And gunsmith 5 on always. It should last 200 plus shots.
---
For some reason its not considered a heavy gun. None of the perks work to reduce the weight so its 22lbs ish with mods.
---
At this point, 76 and I have had a lovely hatred relationship filled with dread upon which immersion will be ruined next.
---
(Disconnected from server)
---
By the Brotherhood, YES! I have wanted this for so long now, so LONG! 
---
In a game that has PvP, it is vital to be able to repair your structures BEFORE they're simply destroyed! Of course, with the current way it is, bases offer no real protection anyhow, BUT in a future version of base-building rumored to be in the works for F76, we will have the ability to repair bases AND have an increased maximum base cost pool, to be able to build larger, more interesting and enjoyable structures. The future is RobCO! 
---
Uhhh, I mean, the future looks promising! 
---
Damn I need heavy weapon perks...60%?? I use a TSE minigun unarmored with no perks and it does fine other than being bit of an ammo hog.
---
As soon as anyone starts to grief me I‚Äôm right out of my power armour for this very reason. Cool, kill me, my scrap
---
Is pretty well stored most of the time but with the the right perks and a tonne of bobble heads these jerks can destroy you‚Äôre hard earned PA in seconds. 
---
I've been server hopping the Charleston vendor. The amount of shacks that block his spawn is insane. I usually hang around and message the owner when they come back. 
---
Most people don't even know and are grateful for the warning. If you don't let people know why they are in the wrong then they will just assume you're an asshole and switch servers.
---
How do you know they were dupers?
---
I know a couple of farmers who have legit been grinding Whitespring and the SBQ multiple times a day for months. They have mule accounts, as well. They complain about how dupers but the economy. They really have hundreds of legendaries. I've gone on farming runs with them, and I've had to drop literally dozens of legendaries only to keep the best.
---
Just saying, I didn't hear anything that confirmed they were dupers.
---
Obviously haha :D 
---
That‚Äôs true. I don‚Äôt have one so I didn‚Äôt really think about it. But most people don‚Äôt seem to have one and they aren‚Äôt essential. 
---
Andddd gone... 
---
That would be fun! 
---
As well, as simply hidden areas in general that one must stumble-upon, with no indicator, but that would be meaningful in various ways - whether with loot, atmosphere, lore, all and more, etc.
---
Someone 1 hit her yesterday after my buddy and i took time to actually drop the nuke. We werent able to loot her and didnt even get quest loot despite being there. I got 1 hit on her before she poofed. Fking cancerous bobblehead duping shit.
---
My missle launcher / fatman do 800/2200 damage per shot when you actually build for explosive heavy weapons. They weight under 2 pounds per launcher and the ammo only weights 0.2 per missile and 0.6 per mini nuke. 
---
As an explosive user i dont think they need a buff but rather 2 things need a nerf. Talons and Twisted muscles needs to be nerfed from 25% to 5%. The strange in numbers buffs this to 6.25% each. 35% damage for each mutation makes unarmed melee numbers scale way way to high.   
---
Also the SBQ is suppose to be the endgame raid. Its suppose to be hard and its suppose to last 15 minutes+. Half the time when a group fails to kill her they lack the following: 
---
\-Armor Piercing of any kind
---
\-The knowledge that she has an invisible 70% damage mitigation barrier you can ignore. 
---
\-The fact you can aggro her in some circumstances and she will like "soft leash" and be immortal until said person moves. 
---
\-Players ignore the adds.
---
\-Players ignore staggering/crippling her while flying around to get her to land. 
---
\-That she scales per person (i believe adding 33k hp per person. not sure how exactly she scales). 
---

---
The bugdet increases with your level afaik. But Im level 130+ and its still not enough, so basically I still have to choose between security and aesthetics. A raise would be greatly appreciated lmao.
---
I have had as many as 10(I think) big ones and it just didn‚Äôt seem to make any more water. So I have 4 now and I give away like 20 water a day and still have over 300 in my inventory. 
---
This area have legendaries? 
---
I've been hitting Wes tec lately, trying for some decent ranged weapons, mostly armor pieces. 
---
I'll have to give this a try
---
Bloodied melee only truly shines in full unyielding/mutation build with no power armor.
---
I had the best time forcing a team of 4 off the ammo shop. Nearly 2 hours later....nuked my house and factory. I mean it gives you warning....it was a wasted effort. The reaction was basically the definition of "trolled"
---
There is one in a planter box by the houses that have the dead girl in the tattered dress.  There planter box is in the side of the house.  I have only had this one produce violet flux, the snaptails never give me flux for some reason.  
---
i'm not sure it's a matter of speed. I had been reading a lot of "if you don't let the health regen, then it wont sync properly and you wont get items," so I have been using low damage weapons against legendaries that don't regen right away. in my experience there is no consistency. I can one shot a hoard of ~8 glowing ones with my TSE combat shotgun and legendaries  that i didn't know were there will drop loot for me. Other times, I can knock off half of a legendary's health with my handmade, will start hitting it with my ski sword while running around trying to keep it alive for a few minutes, and i will still get no drops for those.
---
That trick never works.
---
Out of curiousity, why do you need to server hop?
---
the only thing I know for sure is that there is no raider lining in Uranium Fever. must've done it about 50 times by now and still no shielded lining.
---
I can kind of understand if they dupe deliberately to crash the servers to make. Bethesda fix the problem. But duping just for the sake of it like giving your self endless money in skyrim is just straight up ruining the fun of the game 
---
I agree. I started to get t60 plans after I used the recon scope.
---
hahahha You really think they will go to survival servers? Noone will go there cause people like that don't want challenge and the people who like PvP already left the game cause PvP here is broken. Greifers will stay on Pv(something) servers so they can kill people without the consequences.
---
&gt;I also believe that you have put enough care and work into this discussion, that you deserve better. 
---
Oh my, thank you. I'm not gonna lie though I care more about practicing muh engrish rather than the topic itself but I'm down for the detailed explaination anyway.
---
&gt; "knowledge over gear"
---
It's fundamentally true almost everywhere, yes no doubt - now the issue is how you think it will benefit casuals over "dedicated players".
---
Take rust for i.e. : After the monthly wipe everyone start from 0 and their aim is to go back to 100 ASAP, people who played 1000 hrs and therefore have knowledge about the game will go back way faster to 100 rather than average players/new players who might not even be able to get back on their feet before the next wipe.
---
Now if the monthly wipe did carry gears over, dedicated players would keep their AKs, ammos &amp; armors while most avg players would keep their shit gears/no gears at all - it would not benefit casuals at all.
---
From Fo76 perspective not only fresh start will benefit the avg players more than "dedicated" players, it will prevent dedicated player to reach the meta that was born because of duping - dedicated players keep their knowledge and will be better than avg BUT avg will be able to compete against most of the dedicated ones because only a really tiny bit of the playerbase will reach the "meta" with insanely good RNG whether they're avg or dedicated. 
---
Even if it is possible with the right build to counter a TSE full assassin's &amp; sentinel's mastodon because you know what mods/perks/strats use, it doesn't mean that said mastodons are "working as intented", it isn't the avg that need to L2P more, it is the people who took advantage of duping that need to be set on the same floor as everyone else.
---
&gt; I am really trying to help casuals and not to save my gear.
---
What you want to do basically is to preserve a nasty meta, attainable solely because of the duping exploits and tell the casuals "git gud you guys, you have no good gears but with the right build you might be able to win against people who took advantage of exploits and own god rolls top tiers equipements".
---
I explained why Man-in-Black style memory eraser would work better than adding a new top tier, fresh start would be the cleanest because it would quarantine duplicates but there are other solutions as well, removing all legendary from PvP would work OR killing the RNG by letting players craft any legendaries although there would be an overflow of duplicates infecting the PvP servers. Let's not forget duplicates are not only god rolls weapons &amp; armors, people have mules on alt accounts with 9999999s of aids, drugs, bobble heads &amp; magazines...
---
You might be actually genuine saying you want to help casuals but understand that the outcome of what you say would not help them at all, it would heavily favors dedicated players, dupers &amp; players who took advantages of the duping exploits instead and overally give a bad experience to any legit player who would want to try PvP servers.
---
These times are reasonable even with tse. It depends how many ppl are there. And prime receivers help.
---
I killed her with 2 of my buddies in maybe 5 or 8 min the other day. None of us have tse or bobblehead shit. Just prime guns. But it was also just the 3 of us. The day before there were 10 other low lvl ppl there and the most adds id ever seen and we werent able to kill her in time (although even then it was partly bc they kept dragging her 100 miles from spawn and she wouldn't land that far away).
---
Thats the main thing i think needs buffed at least on the lazor rifle, its literally worthless when it can fire 1 magazine of ammo then breaks
---
Weird can work... good luck to the weirds out there. üòâ
---
Helping people in this game is like half the fun. The other day I came across a lower-level player who flashed me an "I'm hungry" emote, so I was more than happy to drop him a doggy bag filled with various grilled meats and steaks. The guy couldn't have been happier. Made my session worthwhile to have made someone else's playthrough a little more enjoyable, and it cost me almost nothing.
---
I just want to take D.A.B.S.
---
That would be still not enough to put a single point in endurance. Dying in this game is not smth important. Dealing not enough damage is.
---
Dam. It only 2x times max scrapping mods for me to learn my lesson. 
---
Either start paying attention cause it tells u its gonna scrap mods or install them once u buy them.  
---
First 2-3 times id feel bad.  But the amount ur posting just tells me ur not paying attention.  
---
Yes it sucks it does scrap mods. 
---
Which is cheating b/c only way to do it is a glitch. 
---
Ughh this happen to me plenty of times , lost over 10 mods xo1-t60 :( and more 
---
I been there bruh
---
My buddy and I have tried various things in the game. In one instance, I killed him while he wore X-01 with a TSE Combat Shotgun in 4 hits. I had 0 shotgun perk cards, only the requisite explosive perk. 
---
With full perks for a build and a TSE sniper weapon (which apparently do a LOT of dmg), someone could easily 1 shot you both.
---
I got one shot doing a trade with someone that was wanted. I made the mistake of teaming with them and visiting their camp when they were being, well, camped. I died inside the base (we were both 1 shot and killed through the window) and lost nothing, but it was still an interesting experience.
---
May want to rock the Fireproof perk for the time being, whenever you plan on taking anymore workshops.
---
yeah, screws and circuits can become bottlenecks, I feel that!   
---
As with crafting and scrapping, I enjoyed the masochism involved in building and scrapping large numbers, yesterday in one session I crafted and scrapped 49 rifles. I got 1 mod back. So surrender yourself totally to the gods (todds?) and bask in the pure rejection, learn to love that sick feeling as you spunk 500 screws and springs for no discernible benefit, ignore the concerned looks on your friends' faces and dedicate yourself to completing one of the hardest quests in the game. I'm always here if you need tips or sympathy, friend!
---
About as silly as a company that doesn't polish off the bugs in their single player games deciding to make an online one XD
---
Well, then of course we can be friends!
---
Of course. :)
---
Big feel
---
Fr. I really hope they increase the stash size again.
---
Poor winners are the worst type of winners
---
They need to stop putting ur character into the game before fully loaded cuz I‚Äôm getting attacked by invisible enemy 
---
I waited until 50 to do all my maps to hopefully get some good loot...and after I dug up about 6 I went back to ignoring them just like supply drop holotapes 
---
The difference between 4 and 15 is that you can hold almost 4 times as much.
---
It'll take the same amount of time to produce, you just don't have to check back at camp as often.
---
Maybe , seems like there‚Äôs fresh corpses showing up in places sometimes.
---
Giving the false sense of them recently dying 
---
so you say thst if i use shotgun to wipeout creatures, it may that i recieve different loot?
---
did the ammo factory.  was running into the zone after and I hit the guys camp as well. almost felt bad.
---
Although the romantic idea of a Combat Armor Headlamp I would enjoy, I must say:
---
By the gods, man! Do you have any idea of the masterful level of technology needed for a "Combat Armor Headlamp"?!   PLEASE... Let's stick to the SIMPLE wasteland tech of old - mini nukes, power armor and the like. There's no need to try and advance the wastes ...
---
If they follow your instructions, I'd see this survival experience coming out exceptional. If they miss 1 or 2 on this list though, it's going to be a huge problem.
---
&gt;People aren't playing the way I have decided they should so I am using my time ingame trying to force them to and it is pissing me off.
---
I transfer all mods to my stash that prevents this
---
I have 2 on Xbox one , selling them for let‚Äôs say ...
---
333 capszzz
---
Heres the SBQ mechnaics that ive notivced so far: 
---
\-She flys around until people start to stagger/cripple her in the air, then youll get her attention. 
---
\-Every time she takes off or lands add's spawn. 
---
\-She does that ice carpet bomb twice always.  
---
\-She does those melee charges. 
---
\-She mutates and heals also. 
---
\-When she lands she stays on the ground for about 15% of her hp then takes off to repeat her rotation spawning more adds. 
---
Ive killed her enough to know not to chase her around and wait for her to come to you. The most difficult thing about killing the queen isnt even the queen, its getting people to sit in 1 spot without leashing her into a spot where shes immortal. Not to mention it seems nobody knows what Anti-Armor is and proceeds to do 1 damage per bullet because they dont know she has a 70% hidden damage mitigation nobody can mitigate. 
---
AB - SO - FRICK - N - LUTE - LY - !!!
---
I'm... Not upset, I just really don't understand why you feel the need to tell me this. It has nothing to do with the specific situation I was talking about with that guy and *his* tendencies with underleveled items.
---
Came here to post this, but glad someone already has xD
---
Pretty much a lot. Levels do not get MUCH harder to get after 50, especially as you start farming specific locations with good weapon (like well-modded non-legendary rifle and sneaking is enough) and maxlvl enemies like mutants/ghould/scorched. I am 152 WITHOUT farming whitesprings or nukes. I get around 5-6 levels per day of playing.
---
Well I cant confirm that. But it looks like that's the case. 
---
It is a glitch supposedly they are working on it
---
lol do the grafton event, he teleports to the end.
---
&gt;Also the lower the weapon weight the less AP each VATS shot hits
---
THIS is what I was looking for, I knew there had to be some mechanic to this.
---
Do you know it weapon weight reduction perks affect this or is it just the base weapon weight?
---
Imagine someone having a sandwhich, but suddenly they have 2 and you are unaffected by it.
---
I'll pay your ransom.  Just let my son go.
---
Exactly what I think
---
I havnt seen white springs nuked for weeks it‚Äôs always fissure prime now , now days I just nuke the homes of my friends 
---
does more damage than the Light machine gun
---
Your math is entirely way off base there buddy.  2 minutes could get drawn out to 5-8 minutes at most.  The groups taking 30 minutes today aren‚Äôt really prepared for the boss battle - they‚Äôre mostly leeches who show up unprepared.
---
Seems like any mechanic to do this would make worse potential situations.
---
Sweet build!  Upvote for using supports instead of a floating castle. 
---
That's fair. Multiple mules each with 4 or 5 copies of the 3-star TSE Gatling gun. That to me seems like a lot of farming to have that many of this weapon.
---
I'm always open to being wrong and did not report them or make this a witch hunt as I don't know if they were 100% duping.
---
Where‚Äôs the stash at white springs 
---
First Prime, then Whitesprings
---
The last gun I was messing with was a Medic's Gatling Gun, which gave me I think just 5 shots with 200 AP...
---
I'm guessing a smaller auto weapon would be a little more efficient..?
---
Welcome to the game. The vast majority of the community is quite welcoming and kind, I've found. There will be moments of loss, but that's as it should be. There is far more gain, however! Again, welcome =)
---
Yes, I have had the same concern. 
---
I have been searching the market for alternatives to tse. 
---
I have a sniper sneak build, the zealot scorched killer lever gun with sneak is amazing against scorchbeasts and the accompanying scorched ground troops, but against the SBQ it is terribly low damage. I can't even see the damage I do with a 3,5x sneak attack critical head shot. Her health bar doesn't even move when there's 10-12 players at the event. (done this several times). 
---
So, I scrounged the market and drop some caps for handmade variations. I picked up a bloodied, instigating, and furious. I only put a hardened receiver on them because I am not sure the return investment would be beneficial for a prime receiver. 
---
After using all 3 in SBQ battles, I've concluded that the furious variants will be superior post Nerf. 
---
I've only taken the furious for a few spins but because I don't have silencers on them yet, I wasn't able to pull off chain sneak attacks. But the best alternative over been able to find so far was the furious. Only because of the consecutive hit damage possible with VATS. 
---
Instigating handmade made quick quick quick work of the scorched humans, but the zealot scorched killer lever gun was superior for most all creatures (the deathclaw and yao guai we're still tough). 
---
Anybody else have any experiments like this for the SBQ? 
---
Survival mode will be full of assasin/sentinel, only way to kill is catch them off guard or radium guns. 
---
Just lol. 
---
Even my legit farmer friends barely have any TSEs. Five copies sounds dupey AF.
---
I mean did you see what that server was wearing
---
It does? That's awesome to know. I built halfway up a steep hillside, as at the top were some flat rocks, and a lead deposit. Thought it looked interesting.
---
Proceeded to build almost like 3 chalets with walkways etc between them, however i havent been able to really decorate or defend it due to budget.
---
If someone lower level than you was in the area first, it will spawn lower level enemies.. then you'll get lower level loot. 
---
I dropped yesterday over 50 plans got tired of hauling them and struggle with the weight,literally nobody would buy them nor trade them on Xbox üòì
---
Cheers. Try this and didn't work. Will try again when I'm online. Was yours done on PC
---
BS. The fact you had to reference this magic level 8 being female is all I need to know about your story being bs. What does her being female have to do with the rest of what you wrote? Also I HIGHLY doubt a level 8 is contributing anything in a SBQ fight she can't even share a rank 3 perk at level 8. C'mon, man. 
---
Mushroom Molted Mole Miners
---
Im just hitting that level now, but i do level super slowly as i like just rambling about rather than quests or grinding. maybe i should go to whitesprings and follow your path haha 
---
So far on the PC platform claiming workshops almost daily, I have never had someone take over or try to kill me. For the most part I setup the area unlocked and for anyone to come in to get scraps, water, food etc... I find it better that people setup extractors rather than just mining the ore one time. 
---
It's a tall tale bro I wouldn't think on it too much lol.
---
Again, I‚Äôm an avid roleplayer but these people seem to get off on being ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to others, even within their own ranks. Was a toxic environment 
---
Is there somewhere to find out all possible mods for all guns? How'd you know what mods were possible for the radium rifle?
---
I bought an online game, enjoyed it and I just thought that a single player DLC would ease many people who said that 76 lacked role-playing/story.
---
I‚Äôm on most days building random things around the map, send me an invite! PSN kazamati :) 
---
Cheers. Tried this and didn't work. Will try again when I'm online. Was yours done on PC
---
Does the queen get more health if there are more players 
---
Yupperoonie
---
Screenshot/Video their names so bugthesda can monitor them to see if they‚Äôre actually duping
---
Run a support ticket, you‚Äôll be doin the community a favor. 
---
I suspect they'll still be good weapons to use provided you've specced into explosives expert.
---
I‚Äôve got a 2-shot Ultracite laser I started down a similar journey on, although with Science! Perks it‚Äôs a bit cheaper to build (need ultracite though...) 
---
I‚Äôve probably made about 80 so far, with Super Duper bumping that to 115ish. Still missing so many mods... 
---
I'm so sick of Whitesprings, thanks for that.
---
This is a good tip.
---
DMG Perk (1) + Expert DMG Perk (1) + Master DMG Perk (1) = 30%.
---
That's what illegal via game laws is applied to. So, you haven't invested more than 4 years into a MMORPG I can guess? Well, when you run a currency business and make USD off someone's game, expect to get banned and to lose everything that you worked for. Fallout 76 is not like this. Not really.
---
I personally feel disassociated with my characters because something about this game doesn't feel right to give me that connection that I've needed. Maybe it's something hard to work for, or unending quests for that one bad ass legendary that everyone wants. It's all bland and mediocre at best. 
---
Oh yeah! I got a TSE weapon finally!! "Bethesda is nerfing that in the next patch".. 
---
"Fu**!! "
---
Probably Tuesday
---
Survival Mode coming in March.
---
Oh so it's not just ecological balance?
---
Nice,time to farm the forest.
---
The beauty, complexity and depth of the F1/F2 and, even F3 and New Vegas, is nowhere to be found. Still, I play F76 way too much and simply enjoy it for what it is, instead of what we dreamed about long ago. I know, ever since Fallout 2, I've wanted something like this, just not, well - like THIS, exactly. 
---
Still, there is plenty of time and plenty of possibility for them to expand, add to, and/or detract from, what is currently there. I just don't have the confidence in the upper management having any sort of heart and soul of the franchise in mind.
---
Attack dogs and scorched dogs drop this item on 76 worthless 
---
What kinda spare legendary Radium Rifles do you have? And do I bring the materials to mod one or pay caps?
---
Sounds to me like they seen the patch that was coming out and decided to empty inventories before they caught a ban hammer. I could be wrong but sounds pretty plausible. 
---
Op, mine got delayed by a month (with no message or warning), could we get some pics so i can decide if i should cancel the purchase? Don't wanna end up paying for another piece of Bethesda trash
---
The crafting shop in whitesprings main building.
---
Slap damage is capped, there have been a couple videos, check out u/-baloo, they posted a vid 2 ish weeks back where they have 240k dmg and tried one shotting a player in pacifist, it doesnt work but they easily one shot a couple lvl 68s and a SBQ with the same build.
---
My guess is someone used the workshop pvp flagging to flag them without their knowledge, hence the no wanted for the aggressor.
---
The bobblehead thing is people exploiting a bug. Bobbleheads stacking is not intended. Yeah, there's some design decisions I would've gone different on, and obviously there's still bugs to fix, but bugs aren't planned, and calling something "a very poorly planned system based on people exploiting a bug isn't really accurate or useful.
---
Bethesda, waaaaaaaaa.
---
All mmo‚Äôs have had a duping phase.
---
The dupers just make it worst selling duped items for real money.

Inside the hotel, the shop with all the crafting tables. Go in the back entrance, then it‚Äôs the second door on the right.

I posted the above idea before that should prevent this from happeneing
---
The nuke part is my favorite.  That would get me turnt up if I was out in the waste not knowing where it would land 
---
Maybe even add it that even when it lands you still don‚Äôt see it on the map until you come into a particular range of the nuke zone 
---
Yeah, there's a post in r/fo76 which has a list. I got the data mined info on the radium and added it in too. Search for reddit weapon mod list on Google and it'll come up. Lmk if you can't find it and I'll look. 
---
Someone mentioned this a month ago and I started using the recon scope. You do get better loot and it doesn't take much longer. You can actually just wipe out all the scorched during the evacuation step.
---
Then the January patch hit and now all I get is T60 Motion Assist Servos or Excavator Motion Assist Servos.
---
What are you getting? Maybe I just have RNG Assist Servos and don't know it.
---
I think we will hear something today if it is really coming out before feb. this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time they suggested a release date in a blog post and then completely miss it. 
---
It still takes the materials from your stash reguardless of what you carry on you. The mods most people lose are already in their stash box and not on them at the time.
---
Yup. I use melee, dodgy, goat legs, marathoner, serendipity, blocker, etc...mixed with either unyielding or (usually) ass/cavalier. I don't have a full set yet but when sprinting I'm up to 71% DR against other players before any other considerations. If someone goes aggro on me they have maybe one swing or shot if that to kill me otherwise their dead as I sprint up and oneshot with my OP melee...but honestly? I feel like ass)sentinel is extremely rare without duping, but I could be wrong. I mean look how hard people were searching for a TSE hunting rifle after last paycheck until more found out that new supervisor method.
---
I‚Äôm surprised that damage even registers on her. 
---
When you start doing ludicrous amounts of damage the game doesn‚Äôt register it most of the time.

If you're on ps4 let me know and you can have my spare ultracite buddy!

Thank you all for the responses!

circuits no problem as I include bots/turrents into my farming rotation, but screws!!! these damn screws!!!
---
Wouldn't the mole miners be covered with mushrooms?

These are all great points. Thanks!

From my experience the problem is how dispersed they are and terrain problems.grpupijg them.  Outside of couple times week 1 I haven't seen anyone hit it again.

The only thing end gamers care about from them are the (very low) chance at rare Power Armor piece/mod plans. You can also occasionally get random armor/weapon mods as a consolation prize. Otherwise it‚Äôs generic armor/weapons and scrap and chems

TAGGG..ERRR DEEEE..

I‚Äôm the same. You don‚Äôt use the shadowed mod?

Sometimes you are in a team just by yourself if you were in a team recently.

Go to teams tab, and leave teams.

Miss Nanny has the same voice as Curie (Sophie Cortina) and tells you fairy stories.

---
The cap reward needs to end at level 50. There is not enough difference in power between a level 50 and a 220.
---
A level 50 is just as likely to have power armor and a duped TSE as a level 220 is. It is beyond stupid. A level 50 has enough perks for incisor and a super sledge. So stupid that I lose 150+ caps a death getting one shot by a level 40.

Yup can‚Äôt complete the weekly challenge cause none of the flowers I‚Äôve picked apparently count. 
---
Problem is if you want legendary drops and consistent spawns whitesprings is just too darn good.
---
Oh nice
---
You should report them in a support ticket even if you're not sure if they're duping. Bethesda can then verify that and take actions accordingly.
---
I think the bigger problem here is that we have to farm like this to get what we want.
---
To be faaaaiiiiiiir!
---
Bobblehead stacking is rampant, huge bug exploit letting people do massive damage. Get their names, run a support ticket, and ban them. 
---
On Xbox, sometimes the legendary loot doesn't show up for me right away.. I'll just see regular stuff (or nothing) in the loot window. If I wait like 30 seconds to a minute, it **sometimes** appears.. 
---
For example, at Whitesprings, I'll tag/kill every single enemy in the group (usually farm by myself ). Afterwards, I'll check the piles and maybe pick up 2-3 or so legendaries. I'll run around for a bit, come back, and the old piles may now have an extra legendary or two. I have an xbox oneX and a fast internet speed, so technically, there shouldn't be any lag like that.
---
Id have to say i dropped them.  
---
Ive had PA armor out and disconnected and my armor was always back in my inventory.  
---
When u drop PA frames they show up like u placed them.   
---
Well they could still add it to PC.  My PC doesn‚Äôt care about any thing slowing it down. 
---
The game scales it up, so that lvl 36 is hitting you for whatever and the game is giving him some extra bonus damage based on his weapon/level/gear. It's to even it out so low levels can have a shot at high levels with bounties
---
Game would be 100x better withoug bobbleheads and legendaries. Change my mind.
---
The emoji could be pip boy pointing in distances, transits to Home Alone's ahhhh-face, which melts over time.
---
Go away shill. You don't even play this. Rockstar paying you to post negative shit here?
---
Well this is nothing like rust. And if you dont like it move the fuck on
---
Found! Thank you so much!
---
I wish they had put it in the game so it showed all possible mods in the crafting menu and the ones you knew were indicated (bright white text maybe) and the ones you didnt were indicated (grayed out text maybe). Until finding this list i was never sure if i had all the mods or not for whatever equipment.
---
I would rather have this than the current Camp system.  Even like an "instance" style base it would be better. Protection against griefers as well the ability to still defend it against creature attacks.  Then throw a Marketplace in Vault 76 that spans all servers and we will be golden. 
---
Terrible, but most mmo games on early release are these days. Woooo 2019 *shoots self*
---
I think my play style will change quite a bit too
---
I don't think rads heal scorched, Jack's pumpkin grenades lower their life and restore it.
---
Sadly, the younger generations largely have no idea of what a game like this could be if the lethargic need of immediate gratification was not such a focus.
---
I am 100% for the removal of fast travel, in all regards and having it replaced with sensible, appropriate (to the lore/setting) transportation, analogous to the OP's mention of the Silt Striders, etc. in Morrowind.
---
Why? Because fast travel largely cheapens the experience of the world (the map), making it seem far less large than it truly is.
---
I would also be for being able to scavenge and craft strange, makeshift vehicles with which to ride and experience the wastes - which would be MUCH more enjoyable and far more immersive!
---
The only point I disagree on with the OP is of keeping fast travel because of labyrinthine interiors. Why do I disagree with it? Well, having seen the entire game, I don't see anything large enough, not nearly, to warrant it. 
---
BESIDES! If you REALLY want to fast travel out of a location's interior, just do a quick re-log :smug\_look:
---
Sigh, you didn't get griefed. You opted in to the shitty pvp system when you took a workshop. Does that system suck? Yes, but you actively participated in it of you own free will.
---
 
---
Springs: Sugar Grove, Camp McClintock, Enclave pest control missions (Yau gui)
---
Screws: Sugar Grove, West Tek Research Facility, Abandoned Bogtown secret room ( All the way to the top of the scafolding between 2 tall buildings, drop down elevator shaft.)
---
Lead: Lucky Hole Mine and Excavator Armour
---
Copper: Abandoned Bog Town, copper nodes and Excavator Armour opposite Whitesprings Train Station
---
Acid: Whitesprings for Abraxo / fertiliser, Hemlock holes workshop for 3 acid nodes, Enclave pest control missions (Yau gui)
---
Plastic: Any cafeteria
---
Steel: Hornwright Air Cleanser Site #03 for Iron, lead and gold ore - Excavator Armour
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea if owned workshops worked the way as camps when server hoping. So you wouldn‚Äôt rejoin a server where someone owns he workshop you already do. Would help to keep pvp a rolling thing instead of dead and done.
---
There's tons of story (You just have to look for it and make your own), and there are RP groups out there if you want to team up with them.
---
I was not aware that they were taking any action against this?
---
Just as a counter point you do realise that any good melee build with PA can effectively do any of the content lvl 30 onwards? Whilst TSE's are good there is multiple ways to beat this games content quicker than they intended. Sure if they expect everyone to go rifleman build or heavy guns and shoot potatoes it may play out at the length they expected but anyone that actually wants to do damage or play the game hardly wants to play "lets kill the sponge" boss.
---
I had already done all the content in the beta and that's without TSE's so I don't think that's the issue more so that the game wasn't designed to be done this quick with or without TSE weapons and they need to add content for this reason.
---
Oh mannnn I was really hoping Bioware hit a home run despite peoples fears this time. Thanks for response bro.
---
A poor design construct of low durability value is the culprit. It's not the only gun like this.
---
coming in hard with the crustacean facts
---
I also have fps drops (down to low 40s sometimes) in Morgantown Airport. Do you have solid 60fps on Morgantown Airport with these settings?
---
it is weird,  suppose two player kill same creature together, they should get different loots ! 
---
That‚Äôs just a good spot to build though, I remember the very first spot I built in beta happened to be where the Charleston vendor spawns without any knowledge. Just a solid plot of land.
---
I, for one, like the lack of human NPCs in the game. This early in the apocalypse, the wastelands should be a lonely, barren place. For me, it adds to the immersive quality of the game. When I have to navigate seemingly endless dialogue trees, it reminds me that I'm playing a video game and takes me out of the world. 
---
The ‚ÄúT.O.W.N.S‚Äù was an idea of mine that i had suggested on here. 
---
What do you play on? I'm on PS4, Vampyreguardian. Add me, I'm more than happy to tag along. Lol. Great way to earn caps if you keep all the  legendary gear üòÇüòÇ. 
---
When it's hit with a Nuke, go round the whole area, should be glowing ones. Make sure to have power armor or  hazmat suit. Power armor is best with 3 cores on you. Lol. Even without a Nuke it's decent. 
---
ok, i'm one hand chop, i'll send you one now
---
But they would need actual skill to win a fair fight
---
It will scrap them right out of your stash 
---
I was on the popular double node in the toxic valley, up by the space station.  Eventually forced me to go camp hunting.  Found a super great spot that has not been blown up.  Has a lead node and 2 iron deposits, and some nearby item spawns and such. I also changed areas so I do more of the local events.  
---
I do wish I could also have a mobile camp.  I like having a spot but miss the mobile camp life.
---
It‚Äôs no big deal I guess haha. Just stuff they need to work on.
---
But Jet doesn't exist yet!
---
&gt; The cherry on top is the Atom Store, where 90% of the items make your character look ~~funny~~ stupid, like the sun hat or pajamas. Either **the people creating items for the store have never played the game** and have no idea what it is about, or we are witnessing a change of ambiance in the Fallout Universe. 
---
So you missed all those years of anthropomorphical ponies and thomas the tank engine mods on the nexus? Because it looks like they actually took the people who played previous games, just took the people who installed silly mods for the lulz instead of the serious modders...  
---
I agree with you on the rest tho.
---
I love their convo too, but I do wish it were not as frequent as it currently is. Granted, I don't want it to be that much different, just by a few more seconds.
---
Idk, I got a 3* powerfist that dropped that i traded for a duped tse minigun that i traded for a duped .50cal. In hundreds of hours the best .50cal i had drop was a mutants (10% mutted damage). 
---
Everyone out there bitching about dupers but still using their shit. All im saying. 
---
Chad knows! Hope life at that amusement park is going ok Mr Vendor Bot!
---
I would do... but im on Xbox sadly. 
---
Thanks for the offer though!
---
Exactly! Like, on one hand, i get it, theyre free, but theres alot of challenges that arent working. I still need yo kill a Yao Guai... No, no i dont. So, on the other hand, i feel like im being robbed of something i could have.
---
Does that sound bratty? Am i wrong to feel this way? As broken as this game is being, this is like bitter icing on top of shit cake..
---
I FREAKING HOPE 
---
Gonna copy paste here the comment I made meanwhile :
---
&gt;to the whole "knowledge over gears" / "The whole premise that its the gear that puts the casual at disadvantage and that starting fresh without duping would make casual lives easier is utterly and completely based on fantasy. "
---
"Knowledge over gears" is fundamentally true most of the time, yes no doubt - now the issue is how you think it will benefit casuals over "dedicated players".
---
From Fo76 perspective not only fresh start will benefit the avg players more than "dedicated" players, it will prevent dedicated player to reach the meta that was born because of duping - dedicated players keep their knowledge and will be better than avg BUT avg will be able to compete against most of the dedicated ones because only a really tiny bit of the playerbase will reach the "meta" with insanely good RNG whether they're avg or dedicated.
---
&gt;to the whole "I am really trying to help casuals and not to save my gear."
---
&gt;in fresh start environment with open PvP, initial advantage of hardcore gamers will be considerable, and conditions of gaining power as a lone wanderer who's now suddenly unable to easily enter best farming spots will be punishment for casuals, not for hardcore games 
---
Yes this is 100% true so why would you let hardcore have all their duped gears (whether they duped themselve or not) while most of the casuals are butt naked anyway. It doesn't make any sense.
---
Yeah, they specifically mentioned in the last Inside The Vault or patch notes that duping would not be tolerated and that if you see duping or believe some of your items have come from duping you should submit a support ticket so that Bethesda can ban the dupers and make sure you don't get banned for owning duped items (as long as you weren't aware of their duped origin).
---
Yes but they can have a legendary effect that makes them 90% lighter :-) 
---
Armor weight affects stealth when moving IIRC. And there‚Äôs been several claims in this post that the mutation stealth bonus is equal to the stealth bonus of 5 pieces of the chameleon armor. (The Chameleon effect isn‚Äôt just visual; there is a numerical stealth bonus that goes with it)
---
This is why I quit playing my stealth ninja build :( too op doesn‚Äôt register can‚Äôt play 
---
Very slow walking in home base which is mildly huge ( can‚Äôt run ) 
---
Crashing during missions, but can reconnect with last squad
---
Teammates not working together to utilize combos on one  tough enemy for max damage 
---
Loading screen freezing at 95%
---
I‚Äôm still goin to play it tho, just need to play with competent teammates that understand the combo system for hard difficulty 
---
It takes about 25 minutes to walk from one end to the other.
---
There id a mod like that on fallout 4 that his rral physics and the wheels move too and its amazing but it is pretty slow.But I love this idea I would definetly like it
---
This is the real hot scoop!
---
Wow me too thanks
---
Me and my friends would build a military base
---
That's nothing unique to UF. Happens occasionally at Whitesprings nuke zones. Those types are a minority. I wouldn't let it get to ya, because if you do, they've won. If you just shake-it-off and move on, you'll personally be better-off for it. 
---
There's a few bad apples in any large community.
---
You're like those retail customers that buy a shirt, wear it a few times, and return it
---
Also, some of those folks are obsessed with "efficiency".  Gotta hit WS, gotta run a particular route on a particular schedule, blah blah blah.  I deal with that at work, I like to check out of that mindset when in a game.
---
Have you found any of Enola Walker's holotape stories yet?  It's a pretty sad story but it's kind of interesting to follow her trail.  
---
at the risk of losing my favourite place, try the secret room in Bog Town. And remember if you play long enough, the world will reset and you can go again...
---
You sound like the PS4 version of myself.
---
I had a quad explosive radium drop for me and ever since then I've spent all of my play time hunting materials to build radium rifles to scrap. I found out that the Sunnytop vendor often has half a dozen heavily modded radium's in stock and blew my entire cap stash in them hoping that they would have an increased probability of an unlock, but they don't and building level 40's seems optimal. Now I spend all of my caps on screws and springs.
---
I Still have a lot of mods to unlock and honestly don't even know what mods there are. As if now I'm happy with my setup with the tweaked receiver and all I need now is a mod for the muzzle.
---
Morgantown has a few ghouls, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs always been very poor for legendaries. This is from the same guy who made a video on Monongah being the new Whitesprings - it‚Äôs really, really not. It‚Äôs a waste of a silo run
---
God Daggit Bobby
---
You can adjust the speed of that motorbike with the mod‚Äôs settings or the aid items with it.
---
Your base, your teammates' bases, your teammates' themselves, and Vault 76 are all free to travel to and cut down fast travel costs. Not much need for this old mod from fo4
---
&gt;I'm guessing the Vault 94 priests and these vines are somehow connected to the Mothman cult.
---
The first rule of  ph'nglui mglw'nafh......
---
Coming from a generation of gamers who are still not liking any 0art of the crafting experience of this and the last fallout game, I can understand why people would dupe items. Its more like Bethesda is the store, and they just started charging for using the grocery bags or shopping cart, cause in FO4, I could at least use console commands to kinda skip past the crafting aspect of the game by addibg items in cause I hate crafting camps, now I can't. 
---
That is a fair perspective to have. What would you like to see from DLC?
---
In the wasteland, you have to find happiness where you can...
---
The armor stealth also makes a audible beep noise when you go into it. Other players can hear it which can actually get you noticed.
---
The devs don't know how guns work. When you reload the revolvers you don't even push the cylinder slide forward. You just pop it out. And you don't even charge the bolt on the assault rifle after reloading it. Yet they went out of their way to make the single action reload so long it's nearly useless. Love the game though but they need to go to a firing range.
---
Like... Does the now you carry cause more noise? No. Armor type does though
---
This area doesn't have many legendary it's best for XP farming
---
Aha! Now I'm with you, some time has passed since I heard her voice
---
It'd be a cool addition but I think fusion cores would be more applicable as they powered cars and I presume bikes were nuclear as well. 
---
Nah even the kid who 'invented' it said he just rediscovered the recipe. This comes up in r/Falloutlore sometimes 
---
It‚Äôs kind of to the left corner of the shop
---
Suggest that it is added to the Awareness perk, which would give it a useful effect.
---
(Current effect is not useful because it is well documented that physical damage is superior to energy damage in all cases. Until energy weapons have rebalanced durability, damage, and armor piercing effects work on energy resist, the Awareness perk will continue to be useless.)
---
Brother! We even use the same receiver, Tweakers know what's up! You can always shout me if you need any tips or ideas. I'll also share my Radium mod spreadsheet with you if you want a full list of the mods to use as a checklist. Slide into my dm's bud!
---
It's inside the hotel, in the shopping area, at Artisan's Corner. Can't miss it.
---
Literally all week when i would get on, half the list would already be 10/10, but it still said Pick Flowers 0/8. When i made this post, they were ALL at 0, so i was like "sweet, now i can give this a shot". Picked flowers, no increase. 
---
Just got to a different server and the inner list in back to 5 things 10/10, a 6/10, 4/10, 1/10. Main list still says 0/8..
---
Did not know that üòÇ
---
They were made to withstand nukes, though. You'd probably need to drop quite a few in the exact same spot.
---
Same thing happened to my friends and I while trying to launch our first nuke. Tried inviting the guy to the team, but he declined. We were open to dropping the nuke anywhere, we were just trying to complete the quest. He ran through with speed demon while we fought everything and he jumped on the console before I could get there.
---
Play around with a build created like nukesanddragons.com. Consider your expected weapon. More damage is more damage; if you can 3star go for it, but if you get better Efficiency out of 3 1* cards and a whole bunch more other cards, it may be worth it. Like, for instance, on my Rifleman I use tank killer, and if I go Commando I basically don‚Äôt have enough points to take all the cards I want, I‚Äôd be 1starring some damage cards. But if I found an anti-armor assault rifle and put an armor piercing mag on it, Tank Killer loses a lot of value, it might be worth removing it from my build and bumping up my pure damage cards. 
---
I have been playing around non-nuked Whitesprings this week-end, and there is plenty of legendary items dropping too. I don't know why people bother nuking the area. You could do 5 non-nuked golf club runs in the time it takes to clear a silo.
---
Coming in 2025 
---
ü§ûüèº
---
Let's see. The radiation from the war made things bigger and occasionally glowing.  GECKing would possibly produce overgrown(huge),  moss covered, or Blighted(cover in mold and fungus) creatures. Nuking could amplify all those effects again.  So you could end up with overgrown glowing deathclaws. Or Blighted Glowing Deathclaws
---
This is what I hope to happen. The very fact that there aren‚Äôt Scorchbeasts in other games means that we are supposed to be successful in defeating the threat. So it really doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense for the queen to still be around as they advance the story. 
---
My camp has been not able to be placed several times and I always log out at my camp, but have never found anyone's structure or camp box at all sometimes I think it's just a server hiccup.
---
Yeah, and it might just be my imagination but I feel like my footsteps are quieter and stealthing is easier. The armor given invis also makes a noise that other players can hear when you go into it, giving you away.
---
The first day I tried it I got like rodendron up to 8/10. Now it doesn‚Äôt matter what I pick on the list it just stays at 0. So it seems you can make progress if you don‚Äôt log out -_-
---
LegendAry levels  have nothing to do with your level and everything to do with the level of what you kill.
---
I don‚Äôt know why so many people don‚Äôt seem to understand that, it‚Äôs been that way forever with loot based games. 
---
The other day someone killed me while I was in pacifist mode and didn't receive a bounty. Any idea how that happened?
---
So they "puke love" your camp? 
---
that is the responder fireman stuff
---
For what it's worth, I have a 50mm machinegun with a prime receiver, which I have found absolutely MELTS her health even without any automatic weapons perks equipped. When she landed and I stood there with that beast of a gun pointed at her head, I watched her losing about 1% health per second, and I have never, ever seen her take that type of damage before. That right there is my recommendation to anyone who has the means to produce one. 
---
I love stumbling across CAMPS.  It feels like I've confirmed the existence of another, advanced lifeform in the world.  I feel less alone.
---
I usually leave at least some canned dog food and a couple of Nuka Colas in the doorway.
---
Stimpacks aren't really an example of that, but things like the abnormally high weight of Handmade Rifles and Assault Rifles versus other guns are.
---
Not possible in the current engine
---
A nuke can kill him. Sort of.
---
Every time I run into someone with single-digit level, I always leave them a bag of stimpacks, purified water and RadAway.  This happens a lot around Flatwoods.
---
I wish there was a way I could pre-make some "care packages" so I could do it quicker though, sometimes players run off before I can arrange it.
---
I also have my CAMP by the road up to Mothman Museum, where a lot of lower levels travel, and I have a small water purifier unlocked just for wanderers, with a big Fallout Boy statue pointing at it.  I hope people are finding that.
---
Found a max level TS radium rifle when I was like in the teen levels.  I've kept it all this time despite not using rifles on that character because it's pretty good anyway.  I've crafted and scrapped a bunch of radium rifles but the best I could get was a hardened receiver, long barrel, and glow sights.  No stock, no magazine, no muzzle, no automatic receiver, and not even an aligned, stabilized, or true barrel, just long.  I gave up and just stopped using it because I couldn't dream of getting the mods for it.
---
I often take the Charleston landfill. The other day I had it all set up with a fusion gen and a couple of 100+ guys walked through (I was level 29), I waved and as I don‚Äôt PvP I hoped they wouldn‚Äôt shoot me!
---
They didn‚Äôt, but as I ran over to the station one of the guys took the workshop from me. I was sad about it, even if I could PvP I doubt I‚Äôd have won out, but just grateful they didn‚Äôt mess with me and I hopped over to a different server. That‚Äôs the only time someone has ever bothered me but eh, it‚Äôs a game and I have to read the PvP notice each time so I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs room to complain!
---
Just never try it at Flatwoods! The low levels will think your trying to trick them! After 45 minutes i gave up and stuck to the Golf Club! lol
---
Sometimes dupers provide a good service to the players, and save them a lot of wasted time on an ill thought out loot system and top tier reward for an event (1 star trash).
---
There's actually a photogallery of Chernobyl 25 years after the accident, the same time frame we're looking at in Appalachia, and in the exterior shots you can definitely see trees and foliage ( https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/02/chernobyl-25-years-after-_n_816902.html?slideshow=true#gallery/5bb176fde4b09bbe9a61c12a/7)
---
But, as u/finalestate pointed out, this is a fictional universe where eating a mirelurk cake can allow you to breathe underwater and a hermit crab can use a bus for a shell.
---
No, i dont use whatever it is.
---
I dont use vats (because its clunky in76)
---
I dont like the display in PA, so i only use it in nuke zones. Or sometimes for high rad events, and excavator when i hit lucky hole mine.
---
That said, ive only used PA about 4 times (30min to an hour each) since the last update.
---
I wouldnt say the fat man is a joke but underpowered in terms of damage output, the fat man has a massive explosion radius when paired with grenader and this allows you to hit a lot of enemies at once
---
Can‚Äôt have cats or wolves I‚Äôm afraid. 
---
maybe it's an airborne disease like anthrax
---
It sucks I had 5 level of rifleman perks that I had to scratch after I got the mod......I am now a commando which is what my quad ammo capacity was meant to be.....lol.
---
I feel bad for the Whitespring farmers. I've spent most of my play time hunting for mods for this old rusty radium rifle that was handed down to me and it's been a good time. There is so much more to the game than farming Whitespring!
---
I also had the Prime automatic receiver plans drop from the queen but I could never turn this thing into my secondary weapon.... I've sunk too much time and caps into it.
---
False. Modders have done vehicles on several occasions inside this engine and older versions of it too.
---
I mean something exactly like perma-wanted status, but I guess if it ain't account-bound, then it ain't permanent, just a temporary nuisance. I also don't want the game to be completely unplayable for them, they should be able to form their own communities of mutated ugliness. But you should always be able to spot them on map, and they should be threaten like pariahs, outside of society, unable to ever rejoin. And there is no point in punishment if there is no redemption possibility - if the game would allow doing something that gives little benefit to you, but a lot to rest of the players, it'd be very cool if doing shitloads of that thing would lift your pariah status.
---
Someone on a server I was on set one down there, kind of centered around Valt-Tech U.  I ran into like 3 separate mobs of 20 Glowing Ones 
---
That's dumb, you don't know sabout the lord
---
Im not that worried about achievements. But i may someday make a new char, at least to go back and get the ones i missed(did during beta).
---
Sounds like the real life story of Alexander Shulgin who rediscovered MDMA.
---
Just in case the point hasn't been driven home enough yet. If existing characters are allowed into survival moe, it **will** absolutely be broken right away. People will bring over duplicated and overpowered items, and bobbleheads. There would be worse chaos than there already is. 
---
Even in the current mode, I've been killed at least 5 times in 2-5 shots, without ever firing back, all because someone stacked bobbleheads and entirely bypassed the 'slap' mechanic.
---
Are you fast traveling to event markers or to locations?
---
I've noticed that if you use the event marker to fast travel and the event ends while your enroute, you will quite often get stuck in an infinite load screen.
---
&gt; How do you know they were dupers?
---
Because of relative rarity of items. If you have 35000 steel, well you have a hoarding issue but I trust you got them yourself. If you have 100 of the same bobbleheads / all the best possible guns there is an issue. 
---
spoken like a true griefer.  yes I know it enters PvP and yeah they took the workshop, whatever... and sure they didn't let me get me back to the loot, weird flex but okay. The moral of the story isn't that I was in PvP, or that I was owned, it's that this has absolutely nothing // nothing. to do with skill, in so it's not something a person should gloat about. If there is nothing a person can do about it... then it's not something that is impressive. If you exploit a game, then use that ill-gotten gain to win vs another player... you're griefing the player. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do something, that's griefing. I don't know how you would define it, but I can't see how that is anything else. 
---
Looks like they are actually cloaked.  Spotted them at nine seconds.
---
Oh ok, thanks then
---
Reiterated. It‚Äôs a video game
---
‚ÄúMY PRECIOUS PIXELS‚Äù
---
calm down.
---
Sure
---
I was expecting ghoul npcs
---
i concur 
---
Same here- killing Legendaries with no drops- and no credit for commendations (Enclave).
---
In the instance i just explained, where i logged in and they were ALL 0/10 (previously, and now, the list is semi complete upon login) I turned around and picked 10 Rhododendron (i was at The Whitespring), still 0/10.
---
yeah, if only it was fair. Hopefully, Bethesda gets their head out of their ass and fixes PvP if they want it to be a serious part of the game, until then it's more of an annoyance than a feature. 
---
Yes, if I scrap a light leather arm and get pocketed... I can then craft a pocketed mod on a heavy leather arm. Or a study leather arm.
---
&gt; until they reload health then killed it, never had an issue doing this.
---
Yeah, still not working.
---
tru. tru.
---
Mods ain't how people dupe things AFAIK. Most of mods out there are UI improvements to make navigation less clumsy on PC, and they are not only benign, but its a shame ain't part of the base product. I.e. from what I know "Known plans" was a mod long before it was announced to be a feature, and I don't know how could anyone argue that knowing what plans you know is every players right in a game based around collecting plans.
---
What's worse is they fixed the event giving out free cans of food to the server.  Most thought that was intentional as it's called 'Feed the people'.
---
Free 5% xp food.  Patched out.  Eating peoples power armor?  Not a word from the community managers.  
---
there's like 3 of them inside the crafting room.
---
I'm only now level 54 - 28 days of playing, my last 8 levels was because someone introduced me to the farming of ghouls at Whitespring. Before that I was mostly questing and exploring. Some quests a little harder than others due to the location being surrounded by much higher level npc's than me. I still haven't explored most of the east side of the map and I continually run in to buildings i have yet to discover in the center. In most cases when I am in a cave or mining site i am always searching tunnels. I don't really care about my level cause I don't want to be level 200 and feel like i've done nothing.
---
I doubt the hamsters powering the servers could run fast enough to make this possible.
---
There needs to be a larger warning when someone trys to take your workshop. It also doesn't seem to appear until about a quarter of the way of contestion, from my experience they just have to click contest then leave before the warning pops up and mess you up. It also doesn't seem to flag the contester as hostile, I've had twice where they were normal player flagged. They should get a special marker on the map similar to being wanted but only for the player who owned the workshop.
---
Yeah, they have clunky controls and animations and are extremely buggy tho, something that you don't want in a AAA game in 2019.
---
Lots of good comments in this thread, so I will try to add some constructive info as well.
---
I have participated in around 30-40 Queen Battles, currently at level 112, and there have been a wide variety of results including;
---
* Lots of Low level players, hiding in the buildings and/or fortifications, resulting in an impossible battle, (I have left several of these rather than waste ammo).
---
* Players Stacking Duped Bobble heads who could literally 2 shot the Queen.
---
   * Some where she was killed so quickly, hardly anything else spawned and almost no one else got anything from it.
---
   * A few where the Stacking Player waited about 5 minutes between the 2 massive Kill shots.
---
* And my favorite, more than 10 level 75+ players in a 15+ minute battle, with lots of spawns.
---
I typically team with a couple other players, and we all run with High Damage Weapons, and nearly every SBQ battle I get spammed with Team invites from low level players, who I simply ignore.
---
Although it's entirely feasible for players with an Alt character to have great weapons and be capable of contributing as early as level 50, I would like to see a mechanic that prevented anyone below level 60 from entering the Queen battle.
---
Toy there are a couple ways that could possibly happen. If you were on a team, your team mate doing any of the following would allow you to be killed:
---
- Team mate attacking the aggressor (henceforth known as Raider)
---
-Team mate damaging the Raider‚Äôs property
---
-Team mate collecting on the Raider‚Äôs bounty and the Raider choosing to seek revenge
---
-You or Team mate attempting to claim the Raider‚Äôs workshop (if you held a workshop and the Raider claimed it, you would be flagged for pvp as well)
---
To tell the truth, if you don‚Äôt enjoy some element of ‚Äúwhether you wanna fight or not‚Äù gameplay, Fallout really isn‚Äôt for you imo. Fallout embodies a dog eat dog post apocalypse...not everyone wants to be your friend. Some people literally wanna eat you. I‚Äôm one of them üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Top 10 hardest addictions to cure 
---
I have a minigun with +10% damage while aiming (and rank 3 of stabilized) that seemed to do pretty well against the queen. We also only had 4 people so she was probably significantly weaker than usual. 
---
Broken challenges broken achievements ahhh all the things I‚Äôm actually playing the game for right now and I can‚Äôt complete any of it, it‚Äôs the worst honestly 
---
Dude, the best legendary drop I've ever gotten was a three star rolling pin. Lvl 30. Got it at lvl 60.
---
One month later still broken. I'm on PC
---
And there is a timer too. If someone recently completed it, you'll have to wait an hour or so for it to reset 
---
Once I got a bolstering wood chest peice for a legendary scorchbeast.
---
Just this past week I've seen Monongah area hit several times, and Harper's Ferry. I like that people are trying new sites.
---
Yea, i think its the mod then. Told my buddy about it (he usually doesnt use one, but asked him to test) and he said he crashed 5 times doing a vendor run while using it. I just took mine off a bit ago and so far so good.
---
you sure you weren't just watching a recording of the stuff I got from the treasure maps?!
---
I've done a couple club runs in non nuke. There are vastly fewer legendary mobs. You still get them, sure, but meh, it's no where near as good... besides a nuke run doesn't take long.
---
Hopefully by that time I will have leveled up enough to be able to hold them off for some time!
---
There was a motorcycle one for fallout 4 that was a actually really smooth, you controlled with the usual wasd, it had very well animated wheels, and tracked the terrain almost perfectly.
---
yup, i know those feels bro, scrapping 50 of these machines to learn one mod is soul crushing!
---
Twitter is the worst place to check ever. I know for one I am guilty for going off on my rants on there too!
---
I could certainly use the XP (still low 70s), but Christ am I ever bored of Whitespring...
---
Thanks, I had seen something like that, too. 
---
I have the same issue or question i guess. I have 5 WP in my camp, not the big ones but the next ones down that go into the water. I know that everyone of them collect water differently and I don't know why.
---
I agree with this, how do you know they were dupers? There are factions of legit traders around, I know of at least one such faction with 609 players. If all their members are farming nuke zones and acquiring legendary items they can amass quite alot of gear in no time at all.
---
Unless the op had seen the usual duping methods first hand within this group I would say they are traders not dupers and require mules just to carry the vast amount of gear these people farm for
---
At first when I first started out with my pipe pistol collection, I had this one guy non-stop following me. I killed again and again until he got the hint that I was not to be messed with!
---
I met a 110 (I'm only 50) and signaled help like 4 times. Dude just kept walking. I punched him (sorry sorry sorry) and he whipped out a ski sword and killed me. It shouldn't have been that hard but whatever. Wish I could settle my debt somewhere by paying a bot. The last two days were shit to play since no one would kill me. I felt all alone in the apocalypse. That map is empty as hell when you're wanted. It made me feel very UNwanted, really
---
Question for you. When modded out, how much does it's accuracy improve? I had a 2 shot Radium Rifle, but for my VATS character it was absolutely useless. So many times I would have a hit chance of 95% and would then watch every single bullet from the magazine miss the target. 
---
It's current accuracy is something like 43, but even with it that low, nearly half the bullets should hit. This is why I got rid of it, never found mods ( apart from the Long NV scope of course, can buy a Long NV scope for any gun, just never seem to find any other mods at vendors) and it was useless in VATS.
---
Just fast travelling. Often back to my camp when it happens, now that I think about it...
---
To paraphrase a retort from another user, this is like blaming Target for shoplifters because they didn't keep all their merchandise locked up.
---
I mean, yes, Bethesda has to do their due diligence in clamping down on exploits.  But where there's a will, there's a way.  As long as people want to cheat in what's barely a competitive game to begin with, and ruin the gameplay experience for other players by either crashing servers, impacting performance or one-hit-killing what normally takes some effort, you're damn right I'm going to blame the dupers.
---
yup, that's why i love Fallout: Radium so much! I am also a commando. Pretty sure we just became best friends...
---
There aren't even any combat armor helmets in the game yet for some reason so yes please
---
My logic for cheating is that I just want to see the story pan out, its only if the game is disproportionately hard, but in those cases I'd prolly just watch someone else play it.  Cheating in multiplayer games is whack, but I see why people do it in order to keep up with competition.
---
I was hoping for some actual NPCs when the other vaults open.
---
Ah no you're on PS4! I was going to ask you to mod my 2 shot Radium rifle haha
---
Something like that happened with me the other day. I was killing some mirelurks when a player came out of nowhere and killed me with explosive shots. I got that message saying I was killed by him and lost 60 caps. Respawned and looked at the map and the guy didn't have a bounty. I even checked to make sure I was in pacifist mode and I was.
---
Sent a message to bethesda asking what could have happened and got no reply. What ektenia said makes sense for me because I did have a workshop at the moment because my camp is close to one and I like to capture it to get plans. My workshop was in the mire and I was killed in cranberry bog.
---
Well they each produce water at the same rate. Industrial can just hold 5 max while other ones only hold 3.
---
For real, man. Getting super hard to enjoy it, but i dont really want to play anything else :/ 
---
Catch 22 at its worse..
---
Haha brilliant! Thanks. 
---
What everyone said is correct. Don't worry about leaving it up. However, if you do frequently get taken down by higher level players or have built in a place with spawns, you do have the option to carry your camp around. I personally love having a traveling camp (even though I'm currently settled down). 
---
Pro- you always have crafting benches with you
---
Con- it costs to place it
---
Your camp box will stay until you place it again but you can blueprint and store your build if you like it. I just store and totally rebuild everytime I replace my camp. 
---
Yeah, ok, I'm down with that idea. They could have their raider factions, and be hunted by BoS and Enclave, etc.
---
I didn't even know there was coal in this game
---
Unemployed I suppose...
---
C'mon man, got shit to do.
---
As yet, if you go back to the subs/sites/forums/gamefaqs or whatever dedicated to the previous games, you'll find plenty of discussion about them, and the existence of console commands and mods as the major reason given why the games are better on pc. It only takes a minute scrolling through mod sites to see that "cheat" mods or mods adding new, generally stronger, weapons into the game's are always in the most popular. Well, those and big booty slooty mods.
---
So sure, *you* never used a cheat mod/command, but that in no way indicates that none of the "og Fallout veterans" did.
---
It costs 13 springs to craft just one rifle.  A frag grenade takes just 1 and then to craft that frag into a MIRV takes just 1 more spring.  Being that I'm using explosives, using my springs to craft explosive ammo and nades was just way better.  Now I have an absolutely huge stockpile I don't know what to do with.
---
So because you dupe your opinion is not even worth anything and air is wasted on you
---
Why not ghoul NPCs? Because some ass hats killed all the intelligent ones. That was one of the most fucked up story line I've done in this game so far.
---
I depends on the message exchange of the client and the server and what other things happen near you that require the server to send down messages other than the loot outcome. So you could have the fastest connection with the lowest ping to the server, yet your client is flooded with messages about how other players have fired and what enemies are aggroed to whom before the kill result message arrives. (I don't know the networking of FO76 but some networked game try to rely on possibly lossy message exchanges.)
---
So it is good design that players ignore the high level, endgame zone so that they can fight over tags in a mid level area?
---
Someone once said that game developers shouldn't ever nerf PVE damage, it takes away the fun and ruins games. They need to do these nerfs on PVP only.
---
The problem with loot atm is that the current system is broken.  If the server desyncs a legendary item won't drop and may drop onto a nearby body instead that isn't legendary.
---
In an area like whitesprings.  Lots of enemies being killed will have some of these bodies just disappear.  You will never get the supposed amount of items you should get.
---
Also there is the problem of 2-3 star legendaries dropping 1* gear.  Excellent suggestions in your post.  Beams of light would be great for paper bags.  But they need to address the current system of loot dropping and issues with stuff disappearing.  
---
Just posting about this. It's getting worse! To the point where I hesitate to take over any workshops. There are ways to get back on to the server using recently met people, if you're lucky, but even then I have to pay, and pay extra to get back all the stuff I already built!
---
It would be a nice way to get more teammates in general. Maybe by inputting a tts feature you can speak thru it
---
I've never had something scrap from my stash.... I'll watch for it
---
How about fixing the hacking problem first?  
---
I gave up because the same piece of bovine excrement keeps finding me (Player Jeeshua)  and one-shots me even when I'm in passive mode.  He somehow manages to keep his name and profile off the map so I'm unable to block him.
---
Bethesda pls
---
I finally got the suppressor yesterday myself, I thought I‚Äôd go insane. 
---
I can one-shot the mole miners but when other players are around i use my tesla rifle. And actually the tesla does decent dmg against mole miners as well!
---
What would be the words for the acronym?
---
I'm on ps4 and have not had this happen.
---
Yeah the F.E.V HAS (or might've) caused way more mutations such as the Sundew in the Bog, the Strangler Vines in the Mire, Firecracker Berries, etc. 
---
Any idea what they were fighting for? Caps, pride? I stayed for a while longer after the video ended and they eventually started saying my name proper freaked me out. I think they were setting up my fight. Should have just derobed and obliged instead I just ran away.
---
Ain't that much more immersive experience than just 'dupas brek ecomonies'? I believe so, so this is where my approach tho the whole duping crisis comes from.
---
i rebuilt my camp yesterday and it wont let me put doors in two of the doorways because objects would be floating... guess i dont need doors...
---
Which tells me that the game was rushed out early. A lot of tapes/notes/terminal entries talk about crazy shit in the bog area. And sure it *looks* crazy but that's all there is to it.
---
Where are the aggressive plants? Currently unfinished and to be released in a future patch I imagine.
---
Weird are u sure about that? Cuz I have polymer on light combat arm but only reinforced on heavy ones .-. unless I mistook legs for arms? And no it‚Äôs not one time use mod
---
I had to do the brotherhood quest to find the Taggerdy beacons yesterday six times because of disconnects. Each time, it reset the quest back to the first beacon and I‚Äôd have to fight my way through Watoga over and over. It was miserable. 
---
I can see that backfiring in a way.  People like that will band together.  In a sense, it's almost like a challenge to.  Kind of reminds me of the whole "deplorables" thing with the right.  Like you are trying to brand them, but all you are doing is lionizing them.  It would be cool if that happened then the game would have a sort of alliance-horde thing going on.  You got the branded and nonbranded.  PvP wars commence
---
 I think it's more beautiful as it is today, too much help would ruin the survival experience 
---
This a super awesome helpful map. I've used it multiple times now in planning where to set up camp. Thank you.
---
I got ninja‚Äôd out of no where once and couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Never saw him coming 
---
Launched a ton of nukes now so not a big deal.  Saved me a nuke card! 
---
Someone nuked Monongah when I was on the other day. Not a lot of mobs, but it had flux for days.
---
I covered that in my overly long reply as well. 
---
I'll be on later this afternoon look me up lostchild4560
---
Idk, it‚Äôs in other posts.
---
Alexa play "Ride the Lightning"
---
Seriously though, this is one epic shot!
---
I believe the prime gatling might function similarly - just haven't had much opportunity to test it out yet.  I wonder how much that bonus damage to Scorched and Scorchedbeasts from a prime receiver is.
---
Stop spam clicking!

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Agreed, I think a lot of it boils down to the lag.  That for sure needs to be addressed.  Even if they instanced the Nuke zones to a separate server that might help with some of these issues.  
---
this is definitely possible. Was doing patrol duty yesterday when the bot got stuck in some rubble. turned in a circle a few times then teleported about 5 ft away and continued on. 
---
Thanks for this guys, really awesome ideas all over!
---
I would like to see more events that bring the in-world players together to accomplish a shared goal (like the SBQ currently does). I've also seen some people on here mention a player hub for socializing, vending, trading, etc. I think that would also be kind of nice. It would also make sense that a handful of people struggling to survive would create this type of commons area. Bethesda said they wanted players to fill the role NPCs had in previous titles, but--in all honesty--they really haven't given much of a framework for us to work within.
---
There defs needs to be a sort of "WOW!" emote. That and either change the paper bags to lunchboxes or allow us to buy some re-skins from the Atom store (for like 100 Atoms at most). 
---
Definitely for leather anyway but I can't say absolutely for combat armour... unless it's different? Think I'm going to have to try this out and come back to you.
---
If you build around the golf club, you are asking for a brawl. Simple as that.

I do, I stack it all up. Not even the unyielding people will see you.

Isn‚Äôt the elevator disabled because the silo is ‚Äúon lockdown‚Äù? I got this when trying to enter Alpha yesterday. Was my first silo run, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm an expert...
---
Same as of 1/28/2019. I'm stuck at Sam Blackwell's terminal. After emptying the whole building of Super Mutants I disconnected and went looking for a solution and found here. But when I did load up the next server, I just had to repeat a bit of the quest (load tape, reset his PW to get in, load tape again) and it actually worked. Didn't need to dump all my holos. But we'll see if my next stop glitches too.
---
Do you still need an all rise? I can give u mine for some caps
---
Chop, is that you dude? If it is, congrats! You finally did it you maniac! If not, then congrats again!
---
Ty for help checking it out :D 
---
And I give a fuck why? 
---
Points to you for even knowing that name, my dude!
---
I edited my post with what I think happened.
---
I don't play on a team and I have no problem with how the game works at the moment. Whenever someone get into pvp with me and I'm not feeling like it I just change servers. Absolutely no problems there. I was just curious because the guy didn't get a bounty after killing me in pacifist mode.
---
Have killed random ghouls, no stars, no legendary in the name, 2*or 3*in the loot. Random is random, and I think Bethesda games use a more literal definition of rng than orher games
---
If anyone was wondering, Super Duper works with weapon crafting too. Tested with Handmades and Lever Actions and it helped out to get a "free" scrap every now and again!
---
hahah best comment of the day right there
---
Answering a question with a question. You're too transparent. Good on you for getting paid to be on Reddit tho bro.
---
I just wish there were more interesting uniques in nuke sites so that there's more reasons to drop a nuke than to just farm endless streams of glowing ones for shitty legendaries.
---
They can only hold certain pounds of weight, so you need to check often. Industrial only hold 5 waters at a time, I find that having 2 small purifiers keeps me in enough water (and I run speed Demon so it goes down pretty fast)
---
That's because it's TSE.  Anything else and it's an inferior weapon.  TSE turns anything into a great weapon.
---
Well, except maybe a pipe pistol.
---
inspiring to say the least haha. i recently acquired a radium rifle and as a real life electronics tinkerer, i just love the look with the circuitry. i have a sheet of paper with hash marks for every gun ive made and scrapped for the mods just to see how many it actually takes. ill see you in suppressed radium rifle heaven soon enough my friend!
---
I'm planning on expanding it if you want to know other things for sources
---
What is with this board wanting a pansy like multiplayer experience? Seriously it seems all you guys want to do is nerf the game so as to not get your asses kicked. If you're so worried about big guys with big guns then let the titans fight and stick with the regular version.
---
Fair enough.
---
The secret is duping, friend
---
I want more nuke bosses like the scorched queen
---
I‚Äôve become pretty proficient at it, so I just drop another nuke on them. Kills everyone except the SBQ. Waste of a nuclear keycard and you miss out on killing the queen, but occasionally the second nuke wipes her out. 
---
Anazingi have a strength, perception and I want sneak in, but also have some intelligence just so my weapons last longer. I'm about to say down with the luck points since I can just make ammunition and eat dead bodiesü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Such a shame that the dumb CAMP system doesn't let you build walls on areas with support beams below.  ( if you look closely it like like they're only on the outside deck portions of the structure )
---
I want to make so many cool high builds but refuse to make floating castles. The clipping restrictions on the CAMP system are ridiculous.
---
Ive been at whitesprings where one guy was playing on 4 accounts at once.   
---
He would afk his 3 accounts at white springs and kill everything with 1 account.   Rinse and repeat.

I use jumping as you land, but it will cost you a lot of AP, sometimes not a good idea.
---
The first one I'm gonna try, thank you.
---
Berry mentats do that for "living" creatures.  Would be cool to get one that highlights the dead piles for OP's situation.
---
Not tried this with rifles but I suspect you could be on to something - Furious + Prime receiver when you get it might be the best combo.  If you want to test the effectiveness of different setups, take on regular Scorchedbeasts alone and see how good each setup feels to you.  I wouldn't bother with the Scorched Killer's since you'll still run into non Scorched spawns during a queen fight.
---
Go ahaid you waste of air
---
This is the best approach for the good of the whole community. I do believe exactly that: give us way to measure which one of us is the ugliest, and we will leave you pretty people alone ;)

Well that sucks. I was hoping there was a legit strategy used by decent peoples.

Please Bethesda we need a post system.  Any word on this? I knew it has been passed to the team.
---
When my friends are not on I have to use an in game container.  Last night I bumped into grahm on an alt.  I bought a lot of plans including powered gates.  I wrote everyones name down on the server.  Even looked don't their profiles so I could rejoin. 
---
Then began the moving.  Magazines I collected, 2 shot non explosive shotgun I coverted, powered gates, rare camp plans my main doesn't have.  Lots of junk.  About to leave the world.... disconnected from server!!!
---
Rejoined nearly every name.  The server crashed and everyone was on a different world.  I've done this a few times with an alt who only has magazines as someday I hope to display them in my camp.  
---
Even if I did have a friend online sometimes it a pain marking everything.  Thanks new left move bug..to transfer.  Needless to say I am taking a break from the game after that.  Will probably return in a patch or two but that one was part of a long build up of crashing, freezing in spot and infinite loading screens.
---
Yo shit.......
---
This reminds me of me ü§îüòê
---
PvP oriented people will not have the need to go back farming to PvE :)
---
I seen a post last night about a guy who was in his undies in whitesprings. He was trying to find someone to kill him cause he had punched a scarecrow a few times or something and it made him wanted. He was on reddit asking if anyone would come kill him so he could continue missions...maybe that was him

True, some games are also almost made for cheating in single player to make them more fun. I'm thinking about GTA Vice City/San Andreas and The Sims, games where you just want some kind of "sandbox" mode without restrictions.

The Gatling plasma could last more than 2 or 3 cores before breaking entirely?

---
If we wanted talking NPCs, we've got robots, we've got Grahm, we could have Ghouls.  What people are really asking is, do we want conversations back?
---
Considering Fallout 4, I'd say I don't miss them as much as thought I would.  Most of the negativity I have toward 4 comes from its story pre-defining so much of the protagonist, and the contrived faction war.
---
You might say 76 is a cop-out because it just avoids both things entirely, but I'd rather have no conversation than lousy conversation.  It also casts Appalachia in a uniquely haunted light.  What's done is done.  You can't undo the past.  You'll never be able to confront the Hornwrights.  You'll never find Abbie.  You're basically listening to ghosts and following their story to their inevitable demise.  I wouldn't want every Fallout game to be like this, but I kind of like the different track that 76 followed.
---
Thanks for the report! I'll share your info on both of these issues with the dev team for investigation.
---
I love building camps. I try for really smooth builds that blend into existing environments. I'll leave food and water open for everyone. I  place a lunchbag of food on a table. I absolutely love taking players on tour. Heck I'll drop any plans I have extra at your feet after. Please if you have exta plans when you find an owner drop them. It'll make our day even if we have them already. Come on in and sit a while. 
---
Did Myron actually say that in Fallout 2, or was that added to a Bethesda game to retcon its existense?
---
No, not all of us have time to walk for an hour to our group or location. Don't like it don't use it, but don't take from others something that may be nessecary to their enjoyment. We don't all have hours every day to game, some just get a few here and there, no reason to punish them.
---
You claim to be from the old school generation where story in video games was something you had to read and follow, back before it was just map markers leading you from cutscene to cutscene, and yet you're complaining there no story in 76? There's plenty of story, you just have to actually follow it and read the terminals, listen to the tapes, not just go from quest marker to quest marker.
---
I'm one of those diehard fallout fans, playing since the first one came out, and you certainly don't speak for me. I find the world in 76 to be vast and detailed, with great exploration and tons of lore and story to discover.
---
True but look what we have already in AAA game in January 2018.  Spaghetti dogs, AI stuck with pathfinding.  Constant crashes.  Infinite loading screens.  Events which eat player inventories.  Naked elongated players due to power armor bugs.
---
It can't be much worse than it is üôÑ
---
Yes it is because the game is as they said it was going to be at launch

Supposedly it was in FO2

---
Biggest bonus of Chameleon is that it turns you invisible and renders you to almost impossible to players see you, what makes it OP for PVP. All other effect that increase your stealth has 0 use, because when player has line of sight with you then having some extra silence steps or harder to detect levels are useless. Maybe VATS and radar wont function, but who cares about those if one already sees you. 
---
...And in PVE, if you want walk to NPC then 3 start perks card already giving you that possibility. 
---
So the problem is no interactive npcs. Not no human npcs.
---
No idea what shredding is , also putting those winks in posts will make people hate you, just saying.
---
Its a totally viable weapon if it didn't break so quickly!
---
Well, I believe it does. But I havent seen any proof of it, neither did I run any tests for it.
---
Your camp idea sounds really amazing tho. Would definitely love to see it some day, maybe if youll be able to finish it. But as I know from my own experience, your build is probably gona evolve and eventually change in time (likely sooner than we will get a budget raise). 
---
As of my builds, I usually stick with small structures with lots of details. Currently Im staying in a mountain house by a lake in the savage divide, close to whitesprings.

Go back to /r/politics with your crazy nonsense. Nobody here is gonna pat you in the back for making wild accusations and nonsensical links to demonize people that disagree with you. I don‚Äôt retreat. I reject your hateful form of conversation and have better things to do with my time. If you want to take that as some kind of petty victory then go for it. I learned long ago that arguing with the mentally unbalanced is pointless and a waste of time. 
---
This issue has become common for me after the last update. Taveling anywhere seems to have added risk now, because I never know if it borked on me, or if I should wait just 5 more minutes.
---
Especially bad when it happens after you die and try to respawn.
---
Last I checked I never saw a "Belongs to...." tag on any of the monsters I've killed in F76.
---
Dont bother op will not answer your question and is prob periting some youtubers bs 
---
It's been said many times, so I take no credit, but..
---
Showing or at least sorting by the actual weight of stacks of items in your stash so you can figure out what's taking up so much of your stash space.  With limited stash space, having better tools to manage that space is essential.
---
Or you could just play the rest of the game..?
---
I have 2/3* gear in almost every slot and exactly 0 pieces dropped at whitespring.
---
AWOL Armanents and Uranium fever are must attend events.
---
All my best 3* armors are from trash mobs on the map.
---
Farm events not Whitesprings, especially if you have to use a turret farm @ the Whitespring.
---
I swear VATS is broken!
---
I've got an explosive shotgun that is basically point and kill. I sometimes hut VATS with it when I have a Super Mutant rushing into my face. 20 feet away with 90% chance and it will miss 3 shots in a row before I exit VATS and just pull the trigger myself.
---
Getting downvoted, but not wrong. The "mechanics" are laughable for an endgame type boss. I've never died in the fight, I've only ever seen a few low levels die but never from the boss, from the scorched running around her. 
---
I hate to compare to traditional MMOs, but it's the closest thing I really can considering this is supposed to be a "raid" type encounter. It basically just mirrors what are considered to be "gear check" type bosses, or in other words, a boss that has virtually no mechanics but only requires the gear to do enough DPS to beat before it enrages, or in her case, flies away.
---
It's literally: can you do enough damage to her before she disappears, leaving you without any rewards and out a shit ton of resources for your efforts. 
---
Exactly.  It's a move that directly affects other players and is only self serving the asshole doing it.  I level a golf club turret farm equipment I see one.
---
Small flowering and fruit bearing plants have shorter life cycles than tree allowing for faster hereditary mutation. Plus mutated and FEV mutated are different things. 
---
&gt;Shareholders should know the idiots on this game are driving it into the ground with these decisions.
---
I believe Bethesda is privately owned, by Take Two Interactive I believe, but I could be wrong.
---
To be fair to Phoenix it seems like he‚Äôs the one getting picked on. 
---
They do it automatically on their own. Just takes time unfortunately.
---
I shared the same experience. I trying to launch my first nuke at Alpha yesterday and three level 200 guys ran in killed all the bots and launched the nuke in like 10 mins...
---
Honestly, the meat was more valuable.
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew, mmm-mmm-good!
---
Camping isnt necessarily a bad thing, especially in Survival PvP. It aint gun n' gun CoD.
---
Im more concerned about things like Combat Logging to get your stuff or your base back.
---
Agreed. So maybe something similar but not the same as Destiny for player hub? Or even similar raid type quests 
---
I think an upgradable armored variant of the hazmat suit would be a decent solution to #1. Of course it wouldn't offer as much damage resistance as the other armors, but at least you'd have some protection.
---
Yeah, when it gets to be where more than 1/4 of the players at the SBQ fight are level 44 or lower, I leave the event and that usually gets the Queen to follow me. Once I‚Äôve effectively kited her away from everyone and I‚Äôve collected some violet nuke flora, I hop servers, acquire a new keycard and drop another nuke. No sense in wasting bullets, stimpaks, weapon condition, and time, all so you can see her fly away still with half health because a group of low level dipshits equipped with pipe pistols didn‚Äôt think there was some form of a penalty for going to an endgame fight at level 28. 
---
Ahhh on PC for me. It has not happened to me thankfully but have read so many horror stories on here. Happened to a teammate too. Thankfully it is being fixed next patch.
---
This was suggested as a QOL fix during the beta, in case anyone is keeping track. 
---
Yeah I forgot about those. I took a break after launch and I forgot how it was just a few moths ago. 
---
Lucky hole mine has a ton of lead ore
---
See, that's the thing though. Most of the time they look so defensive when they go on and on about "crying babies" and "just let people play the game how they like!" To me that doesn't sound like somebody who's 100% fine with people outside the game thinking they're jerks for what they do inside the game. 
---
Essentially yh. But also seeing the NPCs develop as you quest. I like the quests in 76 and tracing the steps of ghosts but it does get a bit tiresome in my opinion. 
---
It wasnt planned that way, just kinda developed into it as i sandboxed around haha. I can get some pictures and save to Imgur if you'd like a browse. Only issue i have with it is a bit of foundation looks like its coming out the ground where the hill is so steep, and i cant cram another foundation underneath. Yeah my build will deffo evolve! Needs to already, as i took Poseidon for the first time yesterday, and got the Large Gen. Having 8 mediums was a real drag on space, so now i can remove them all and stick a few large ones in instead (will 8 meds to 4 large save budget?)
---
I would also be interested in seeing yours if you dont mind sharing. Creative inspiration is always welcomed!
---
This reminds me in a way not of a "party" but as an "alliance" and boy would that be nice. If you could be in an alliance and travel to your alliance members camps for free around the map and between each others workshops and collaborate. Oh what a Utopian dream to have actual cooperative play that isn't these griefing trolls running around pking players in pacifist mode. 
---
Legit Strat to kill the end game boss in a minute or two?
---
&gt; Mods should be something you have to MANUALLY scrap if you decide to do so
---
Mods shouldn't be scrappable. Period.
---
Has anyone confirmed this with serious testing? I have a prime‚Äôd Zealot 50cal that fucking melts Scorchbeasts, even though it‚Äôs listed damage is roughly half my anti-armor Gatling Gun. A single shot from the 50cal does roughly the same visible health bar damage as my Gatling, and with it‚Äôs much higher RoF... 
---
The weight of your gear does, how much you are carrying does not
---
This happened to me as well.  I didn't eat anything, it happened right when I looted a guitar sword.
---
It lasts for a few minutes then goes away.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for close to 400 hours and just saw my first Flight Helmet variant sitting around in the world. 
---
You do you. Personally I prefer not using a power armor and selling my silo cards! 
---
You want my Saturday night?  Someone nukes Prime area.  SBQ goes down, good time and much loot had by all.  I trudge overloaded and ammo-depleted to Watoga train station to get underweight.
---
And as I get there...someone drops *another* nuke.  On top of the first one.
---
We missed the timer on the second one, and I'm still rebuilding my ammo and material stocks, but worth it!
---
That's been a thing since at least the early nineties, so yes I had considered the possibility here.
---
To put it in perspective, I'm level 204, farmed thousands of legendaries, and have zero two shot explosive anything. A number of two shots, three non two shot explosives. But no TSEs. It's roughly a 1:2,000,000 chance (someone did the math and created a program for simulating loot drops). Having 4 to 5 copies of a TSE anything means you should either start buying lottery tickets, or they're duped.
---
I don‚Äôt farm The Whitespring, I don‚Äôt have time for that, I just explore and have fun; so I wouldn‚Äôt really know the drop rate there. It just seems that people feel forced to do it because of how unpredictable rewards are for things.
---
I‚Äôm running marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon. It‚Äôs almost comical, you can run top speed off of a cliff. Gently drift down and sprint away with minimal damage. Or jump from the ground onto a tractor trailer then onto the roof of a house. Must look hilarious to other players...
---
You know it's bad when [you're](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajptbw/i_am_the_griefiest_of_all_griefers/?utm_source=reddit-android) saying it ü§£
---
That would kill player trading, no thanks
---
i saw him for the first time yesterday, popped vats and fired one shot and poof, he disappeared.
---
 i've ft'd to my camp on three separate occasions just to have a vengeful mothman waiting for me though. I need a giant bug zapper...

Yarp
---
It's simple. Just make it a dungeon of sort. 
---
1) have a 1 km no pvp circular zone around Vault 76 for level one players so they have a chance to move away from the Vault and aren't immediately gunned down. They can stay in the safety zone until they feel confident to make a break for it when nobody's watching.
---
2) agree
---
3) agree
---
4) Agree, though a case for train station to station FT could be made. Players just arriving at a station and still loading need a no pvp shield, like on some undocking platform. But once they move off it, they're fair game. So if they look around and see hostiles, they stay on the platform and leave. Having a teammate to watch your back while you deal with vendors could be the difference between life and death.
---
5) great idea!
---
6) yes
---
&gt; Also I'm sure there are lots of players who dont want to grind through the storyline again.
---
Get rid of all storyline missions and replace them with true RNG spawns, not the same mobs, loot, and junk spawning in the same places all the time. 
---
Daily quests and workshops could stay. The nuke silo run mission also stays, but add more boss monsters equal in power to the SBQ all over the map: the Grafton monster becomes the Grafton Supermonster, a Behemoth becomes the Behemoth King, a Mirelurk Queen becomes a Mirelurk Empress equal to the SBQ. 
---
That way there's more end-game variety and players can't be sure where a nuke will hit instead of assuming it will hit whitesprings or the fissure in the southeast corner every single time.
---
interesting thx
---
The Gatling plasma does more DPS, but breaks super fast and burns cores fast too. Your upkeep costs on it will be significant, and unless you bring like 4 to a SBQ fight, you‚Äôll run out of gun before she runs out of health 
---
I have always wanted this to be a thing since playing Fallout 3. 
---
Nah, even pipe pistols become great when TSE.
---
Id like to not see "Disconnected from Server"
---
Well since they are coming out with the newer survival version maybe this could be something in adventure mode rather than survival? I completely get what you mean though by not adding it
---
I also spit out my coffee when I read that.  Take my upvote for the title alone
---
Username checks out.
---
The point I'm trying to make, though, is even if you corner the entire market system, any player can still strap on a mining laser because there are always rocks somewhere to shoot.
---
The amount of effort required to police the markets AND the resources, throughout space, is only withing the ability of the largest corporations.
---
OPEC was able to do what they did because the world supply of easy oil was concentrated into a small handful of countries, all of which could arm up enough to make any war of conquest bloody (see Iraq, depending on how much tin foil you have. I have a newsboy cap, myself )
---
So the cost of doing it yourself was a little bit higher than just buying OPEC oil, allowing them to force the market...
---
...until they got a little too big for their britches and pushed the price above the cost of fracking and tar sand extraction.  This made it worthwhile for North America to pay the time and effort to develop locally (because that was still cheaper than the military option, and the citizens of America were done with wars of conquest), and, lo, it turns out living on a continent which was almost entirely shallow ocean during the carbon forming era leads to vast, but slightly difficult oil reserves.
---
OPEC dropped their price the first time (beginning of Obama I), but local production kept experimenting.  OPEC got really worried and crashed the oil market.  I remember the bad old times in Houston well... there was an oil town like no other.
---
Finally, the stupidity of the most important national defense mineral being under the control of people willing and able to fuck around with our entire economy sunk in, and we started ramping up in earnest, and it turns out fracking and tar sands, despite the wails of ultra-environmentalists and hyperbolic documentary filmmakers, was a scale problem all along.  The USA is now like the number 1 or 2 energy exporter on the planet, breaking the hold of OPEC, and seriously challenging Russia's energy dominance of Europe.
---
So, to wrap around to the parent comment, yes, a highly organized and motivated guild could certainly corner the market and make things difficult.  But, we have price ceilings set by the robot merchants (who would have to be policed by mob style "protection" on all servers) and CAMP workbenches (where anyone can collect typewriters and scrap them down). They would need to control every workbench zone with extractors, and camp every resource, and scour every tin can... sure, motivated enough, this is all doable on paper...
---
...but 76 also has gods, and the developers can spin up new servers or add protections to hobble the Mob in ways that dont exist in the real world.
---
I would love to see a 76 Goonsquad try, but the amount of effort for likely fleeting gains would make Prohibition and OPEC look like childs play.
---
Yeah. That'd be very nice. The second part.
---
The first part is more problematic as it would be a very powerful item for 1000 radiation protection to wear on top of your normal armor. It would have to be something more akin to an underarmor, but that doesn't really make sense either.
---
No matter what, using 1 - 3 level 50 prototype hazmat suits and this build:

That's only after you launch the nuke, not before.
---
We don‚Äôt need another Preston don‚Äôt talk about settlements please Beth might try to make another Preston 
---
DUN DUNDUDUN DUDUDUN 
---
Nah, some of us set up shop in the lakes near Top of the World.  Water, livestock, access to vendor and Sugar Grove, what's not to love...
---
There's not a single build in the game that is going to prevent some guy with 100 stacked explosive bobbleheads from taking you down with one shot, so until that is fixed PVP is garbage.
---
Chads are always a good source of knowledge
---
Near the Overseer's camp there are three copper nodes near the water (If you're at the camp and looking at the bridge, head to your right and hug the shore line)
---
More specifically on plastic, Morgantown High has plastic pumpkins that are 2 plastic each, and there are about 30-40 of them.
---
If you dont mind taking a couple shots, I always like to see an interesting camp. Inspiration is always a good thing lmao.
---
Im on rn, give me a moment and Ill do some photomode magic and Ill give  you a link to mine :)
---
LMAO.  Right.  That's why you came crawling back.  You couldn't be the loser.  You needed your "petty victory."
---
Classic, start off a smarmy fuck, get put in your place, get called out for retreating and get pulled back in.  Rent free in your head is nice.  Thanks.
---
Thankfully the fix is coming in the next patch according to Bethesda.
---
Does the daily one work?
---
The slow walk thing drove me insane in Division
---
I lug around all my crap legendary items to give to people just starting out of the vault or at flatwoods. The raider life isn't for me I'm a responder in game and real life. Can't wait to be a part of firefighter gang still can't find that clean bunker gear responder outfit though 
---
I killed 4 farming a non-nuked WhiteSprings, it was a first
---
I went back and looked for that post.  Different guy.  I actually recorded a small clip of this happening last night, so I just compared the two GTs. :-)
---
Well, I mean...
---
Does no one else here realize that coal =/= charcoal??
---
Charcoal is a byproduct of pyrolysis, the act of burning organic material (wood) while limiting oxygen.
---
You literally make charcoal from wood.
---
For me I enjoyed the conversations, more so in 3 and NV. It adds the extra dimension and opportunity to use SPECIAL in a different way. I just want more development for the NPCs and it's hard to do that with a computer/robot (although we did see it done effectively in fallout 4). The world and the NPCs should change as I level up and complete quests. Even having a radio broadcaster like Three Dog narrating the rumours of the wasteland and commenting on the activities you are doing adds the extra dimension of story telling. At the moment the quests feel a bit empty because like you said, you're chasing ghosts and it is obvious after the first few missions that no matter what you do, your just going to retrieve another holotape. 
---
That's awesome to hear. I'm not trying to throw hate at this game. I love it and it still gives me plenty of great experiences after hundreds of hours. Just hoping for more nuke-worthy zones with endgame bosses worth farming.
---
Do you still need help completing this? I can craft the majority of armour mods now and can pass on the details.
---
That would be so freaking cool. Hell, even if it's not friends, just the thought of having neighbors who can potentially become new friends in a designated area would add some pure enjoyment. The last time I played, about a month ago, I ran into two very bad apples in the game. They followed me everywhere I went, always attacking me, even joining any sessions by watching my profile to join my new session if I left the current server. They followed me to my camp and destroyed it completely, ( I know, it can be repaired, but I had spent hours on this camp, and it was sad to see someone just destroying it) sent extremely harassing messages, and I quit playing. So, having an option like that would kind of add a "safe-haeven" kind of thing that gives a good, enjoyable, neighborly feel with the potential for better interaction with other players. 
---
My missing Yao Guai from the Kill 5 different creatures challenge FINALLY counted last night for me. Nearly 300 hours of playtime.
---
I know your pain.
---
O had to be honest as I still live this game.
---
Nearly 200 hours and had it refunded.no offence but I have zero respect for you. In my eyes that constitutes theft. You really should reevaluate your principles
---
I love this idea! The whole thing sounds like a great idea! Because seriously, who really wants to travel (and inhabit) the wasteland alone!
---
The daily works, I had it a few days back and it worked perfectly fine. The weekly on the other hand... 
---
THE CURSE OF THE SCARECROW IS REAL
---
My proposal is play 1 hour without a crash.
---
Its possible they aren't even aware and that this stuff is just rolling out on a predetermined schedule.
---
TIL. Thank you.
---
And now let's imagine a poor duper. He dupes all day and drops everything on the ground and get's dc'd. How shall he feed his kids these days? Bethesda! Come on!
---
Yeah, it needs a little love and a lot of dev time, but I'm still having a blast most days in spite of it all...
---
So, I have a high end item shop. I work very hard to get good items that are not from dupers but often times you go to buy and run into this. 
---
Other times you have people like me who spend almost as much time on r/market76 (which is the trading post you described, thousands of players use it across all platforms) as we do playing the actual game. My shop is supplied by my group of friends and also from player trading.
---
Buy low sell high is the secret. My first purchase was some mutations from a person with the recipes for 100 caps each; after about 3 weeks of trading I have made my way up from a serum to owning all serum recipes, full stash of explosive weapons, etc.
---
Having said that, there are many honest traders out there and also many dupers
---
Just having a nice home increases your chances for it to get razed for the fun of destroying something nice. So yes, you getting robbed regardless of your situation is fair game.
---
Thank Atom it didn't scrap an explosive vent mod
---
I can confirm that this is correct, although I haven't personally timed it. Just from doing loot runs, I've noticed that it goes by the refresh timer of the environment. 
---
This last weekend was my most stable play ever. played about 5 hours straight on Saturday and about 7 hours straight on sunday and not a single DC from server. I play PC though. 
---
Were you or anyone you were playing with using the targeting HUD? i hear that can cause crashes. 
---
So you have to submit a ticket everytime you trade with a player? Also if you trade for a single dress, for example?
---
Its a heavy weapon, but benefits from Rifleman perks.
---
Had something similar happen. Upon logging in, 
---
I spawned within the cliff within my camp, fell though the world then rubber-band back up. 
---
Afterward went to nearest town and could some people talking, but was echoing. Thought it was just their audio, but then I heard more than one person. Checked map, only showed one nearby and they were close but I couldn't see them. Also they couldn't see me. They could see the enemies I killed but not me. 
---
Was weirdest glitch I've seen so far between the f-ed voice chat and not seeing each other could've done some paranormal activities sh*t
---
I tagged a community manager on the first day these challenges were available and she said she‚Äôd try to find out more. Well, the week is just about over and nothing has happened. How about 30 free atoms for everyone, since the bugged game kept us from earning them?
---
I undestand your point of view, really, but it's not funny to be killed by someone being invisible, crounched with sneak bonuses, op legendary weapon, and‚Ä¶ auto-aim‚Ä¶ you can't do anything.
---
It's not a problem for you ? :p
---
I was kindof let down by the nuka factory all-together. It was a lot smaller inside than expected
---
I want more Gary vaults.  Rest of the vaults can be Gary's and I wouldn't be disappointed. 
---
Not trying to be rude, but that would be really bad 
---
Nice idea! I think mine is around 30 (I have a Quad Explosive Flechette Harpoon Gun) longest part is the launch officers for sure, and then mainframe cores if crafting them bugs out (I use super Duper to get more real fast but sometimes it just removes them from my inventory and I have to find all of them instead). An issue is that people have learned an exploit to go outside the map and straight to the launch officer room making it take 3 mins to finish so they would have to fix that first.
---
It‚Äôs like an unfillable  checkbox 
---
Fan wikis are one way. Here is the radium:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radium_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
I don‚Äôt mind hearing the tails of some players misfortunes at the expense of others, breaks up from the usual farming whitesprings or what not.  So I don‚Äôt mind the grief stories, even better when it‚Äôs on video.
---
Balance issue.  Lucky Break + short bursts will give you better results, though.
---
What if we just let Fallout be Fallout?  Games that shoehorn in vehicles tend to have shit controls and the map isn't designed with that in mind.  The roads are all destroyed and the terrain is rarely flat and even.  
---
It's not that big of a map and it's not hard to build up enough caps for fast travel.  In general any fixes that are aimed to make the game even easier and enable you to fly through the content faster is a bad idea.  
---
Am I allowed to use an instigating melee weapon to beat your solo time?
---
i came across a scorched Megasloth yesterday. it was my first sloth so that was exciting. 
---
I also think itd be interesting to have some kind of light PA that has rad resistance. Something a character can sneak in have rad resistance and some protection. I'd be fine if this is just basically scout armor or riot gear or something but I feel bethesda has designed the entire endgame only around people who wear power armor and it's just odd because people who play other builds are just left out to dry. Especially stealth characters because stealth in PA is just horrible. 
---
This game is the shit and fits my introvert lifestyle despite the crash's and load screen freezes and all the little bugs every new fallout is my favorite fallout.  I was just throwing out a Letterkenny reference.
---
Nice.  I've been using one, didn't realize that.  Does that mean RFL and HVY perks both affect it?  Because if it does that's nuts...
---
Fyi 100 bobbles is within reason of collecting, (no they shouldn't stack as they do now but that's a separate issue) you are thinking WAY too small. Ran into someone with over 180,000 explosive bobbleheads. Someone with 100 bobbles would probably have bought them from a duper not duped them, numbers are too low IMO
---
Agreed! I‚Äôve only grouped up with friends when they‚Äôre online, but my best experiences have been with complete strangers. The past couple of times I did Uranium Fever, there were at least a few other players there, and we all made sure everyone present was able to tag the legendaries when they spawned, even calling out their positions with emotes for those who weren‚Äôt using voice chat. Can‚Äôt speak for the console players but the PC community has been really pleasant. 
---
Same boat, its getting kinda full in here! on ps4
---
Yea
---
Do you mean add more? Cuz this is already a thing that is in the game
---
Absolutely! I‚Äôm down for anything really. I just want to see some awesome videos from everyone.
---
Pacifist mode does not stop people from harming you fyi.
---
My Power Armor somehow duplicated as well. First I was stuck in it. Couldn‚Äôt get out no matter what. Fast travelled back to camp. Then it lets me get out but freeze about three feet off of the ground. Does not auto return to my inventory. Eventually I log out. Next day I have two indentical suits. T-60. I‚Äôm just going to junk the extra one. Weight issues......lol
---
Yeah two days ago we killed the SBQ and 2/4 people in my group didn‚Äôt get a legendary from her. We got regular loot but zero legendary and no drill/chainsaw or anything.
---
That part about you going to a Wendigo for a screw sounds really... uncomfortable. 
---
If this Survival Mode go the way I think, it will be dam hard to collect a full set of insanely powerful legendary gear.
---
1 death is all it takes. They lose it all and then you loot all of the insanely strong gear.
---
The Scorched had an addiction to holo tapes which eventually killed them off.
---
They can certainly try, but if it was a GLOBAL market (not server spacific) you'd need vast cap reserves to corner the market.  The best you could do is collapse the price by flooding the auction house until it's just not worth competing...
---
...but that only lasts just as long as you can keep the price artificially low.
---
Because anyone can salvage,  and anyone can scrap and construct most of what they want, and anyone can find legendary items, and the moment your price goes above the opportunity cost of the item you sell, even if you can control the auction house, people will just build the stuff themselves.
---
And if the auction house is server local, well, once your price goes over the opportunity cost of switching servers you've lost.  Unless there are TOWNS that you are invested in, it's a momentary inconvenience to switch servers.
---
Markets, uncoerced by people with the monopoly on force (usually only governments and maybe giant multinational corporations) are amazingly resilient and actually will self balance.  And in a game like 76, where death is no real threat, mirror universes are just 60 seconds away, and everyone has the right to bear arms and use them willy nilly,  any market abuse would be temporary, at worst.
---
Challenge accepted then 
---
I didn't mean to throw hate at the game. I love it. It needs work, no doubt!  This was more for laughs to be had by some of the community members. I'm hoping for more nuke-worthy zones. 
---
To be fair it has only been 3 months. BUT... they have to know that there is some competition down the road. For me, I'm looking at Anthem for what I thought was gonna be the co-op PvE endgame we were gonna get here. I'm looking at Days Gone and Metro Exodus for story and zombies (same as ghouls to me). And Finally Division 2 for Co-op PvP. 
---
We'll see if Bethesda steps it up. Only time will tell. Until then we can just laugh as they already have are money anyways. Life is to short.
---
I like a lot of what you are saying. I was thinking about it and I think the majority of concern for the game mode is definitely balancing issues.
---
 I for one do think it would be a good idea for players to have to start from scratch. There are just too many characters on the servers that used shenanigans since release to get to where they are. If you keep the no pvp until lvl 5, that helps players right out of the vault not just get entirely decimated. If you raise it slightly, completing flatwoods would be relatively safe and give people time to actually gather materials before they run off and make a c.a.m.p. hidey-hole. 
---
The quests are going to funnel players to specific areas. Certain areas are just going to be a huge slogfest. Maybe have a redone and significantly reduced main story quest progression in SM?
---
My real concern is PA vs regular armor, and certain legendary weapon properties. Im still mulling over how I would treat these issues. 
---
3/10 would nuke again
---
Working currently, will take some snaps of mine this eve / tomorrow evening depending on the mrs mood :D
---
Nope - just your Rifleman perks for damage.  Not sure if it benefits from some heavy perks like Bear Arms, but Tank Killer and Rifleman should apply to it.  Just tired of reloading the Tesla constantly, could use 30 instead of the 15 cells.
---
Ah good another karma farming post.  Now let's all agree about how we are against domestic violence or something. Wooooooooooo upvotessssss
---
Yes we do
---
When you stack enough duped explosive bobbleheads, you can kill anyone even if they are in pacifist mode. Should get the name and report.
---
Cool thank you
---
I can craft most of that! Haha I've just asked if they still need help. I can provide most of those stats for resistance and am happy to help out.
---
I've been making my own spreadsheet of what I can and can't mod to work out the gaps anyway.
---
TSE trash, bloodied prime receiver weapons drop queen in like 30 seconds.   XD 
---
As much as I would like this, it does provide a continuity issue. Unless Bethesda introduces a Cataclysm kind of world change, it won't make sense for NPC's to start wandering in with the main story.&gt;! Otherwise low level characters will be doing a main quest line, in which everyone are supposed to be dead, gone or Scorchified, while NPC's are freely roaming about.!&lt;
---
Your honor will be preserved
---
So a thought...  What if instead of lock it down, make it an event?  
---
It will suck that you can go through everything and have someone waltz in and fire a nuke somewhere you didn't want, but they could add some of the challenge:  
---
As new people come in, new robots are produced for defence in those areas (Prevents someone from literally walking through the carnage to give a thumbs up and launch)  
---
Give rewards for launching to everyone in the silo at the time that has participated.  
---
If you are on the quest, you get credit for having launched it.  
---
No Special Reward for the person who launches it.  
---
In a perfect world, this would lead to a discussion of those who are there to where to launch, and post-launch team forming among strangers.  
---
Make the silo's an open world raid/dungeon where everyone who participates gets goodies! After all, this is the mission they wanted us on!  
---
Unless they lock down the silo's, this makes it "more fair".  It will never be truly fair. 
---
Maybe even do bonuses post launch to encourage people to experience the nuke zones:  
---
\+ Legendary to everyone if a Fissure Site is Nuked  
---
\+ Rad Shield if a non-fissure is hit  
---
\+ DR Item if Prime is hit  
---
You sound like a baby dude. Don‚Äôt take over a workshop if you don‚Äôt want to PVP. Why should they let you get your shit back. There‚Äôs cocky dumasses in every game. This is no different. 
---
[This is wonderful.](https://gfycat.com/shallowsnarlinglaughingthrush)
---
I know that. But it did prevent me from accidentally initiating pvp which would have been the end of me. 
---
I've killed one, and he proceeded to freeze in place. Unfortunately, that made him unlootable, but I got some great pics with him
---
Never have. Don't even have a TSE. Highest weapons are Black Diamond, 1* Medic's Combat Shotty, and 1* Stalkers Combat Shotty. RnG sucks but I would never support a toxic part of the community. 
---
There was a card duplication glitch for awhile where you had a "ghost" card that would disappear when you relog. It would let you use it for an extra rank up, but would then bug out that card. Though that was supposed to be fixed in one of the first patches. 
---
We need these challenges as an incentive to play the game.  Bug these out and Bethesda will start losing players.
---
I agree with this proposal!
---
Agreed.  The arcing thing is awesome though, it's quickly becoming my replacement for the Magic Boomstick.
---
We don't need more buffs to heavy weapons.. we need love for pistols, laser weapons, plasma weapons, heavy laser and plasma fixes to durability, and fixes to the amount of ammo you can craft for flamer and cryo. Everyone shouldn't be towing around the same weapons, heavy weapons for the most part is fine with good perks already in tow compared to most weapons with trash perks. We need an all around patch to fix weapons with inferior perks and weapons that just aren't boosted by any perks at all. I'm tired of people wanting to buff weapons that 90% of people already use... and after the TSE nerf even more will jump over to. Let's get this game balanced out instead of favoring a single gun type.
---
I saw someone in a silo once, waited for the nuke which never came, silo empty on map.  Not sure if he was disconnected, but I checked silo status and got to stroll in and launch the nuke without worrying about prep.  Some of the robots did respawn so I still had to fight my way pass them, and acquire the ID badge to get into the silo.  Might as well not waste a prepped silo - whomever you were, know that your efforts weren't wasted.
---
The problem is the size of Bounty. If somebody is 10-20 caps then you know they have most probably incurred it by accident. If the guy or girl is also running around in there whites, then it takes 2 seconds to clear the bounty and another 30 seconds to stand over their scrap for them. Am just over Lv 100 and have everything i want with look, perks, armor, mods and weapons (including 3 TSE). So i spend most my time amusing myself watching and stalking other players (Have a habit of creeping into bases and standing behind players till am noticed). Nothing nasty, but that shot out of nowhere that just dropped a high level creature health by 90% as you battle above your level, could be me. Some other players are too busy grinding and will not bother to stop and help out. Its like when i farm white springs. I fill up the containers in Flatwood with items, as am not after anything new. I think some high level players forget to help other players. 
---

After TSE nerf most ranged is gonna be garbage for SBQ
---
What kills me is when they attack your base, You kill them, they seek revenge and kill you making you lose the equivalent of your level for me 161 caps. I think if you kill someone who has a bounty, They shouldnt even have a seek revenge option. 
---
My GF is level 43 and she has pretty much quit the game cause of pvp. She had a group of people killing her relentlessly the other day just to get her caps and once she was broke *poof* they were gone.
---
**IMO**
---
In my opinion if you arent flagged for pvp you shouldn't lose anything when you die. You shouldnt lose your caps or your junk. This would stop a ton of trollers dead in their tracks.
---
**Base Destroyers Suggestion**
---
I dont know about the rest of you but I am getting tired of the childish base destroying bandwagon. My suggestion to stop this is implement a insurance system like GTA V. If someone destroys your base they should have to pay you caps equivalent to their bounty and it should cost them the resources it would take to repair your base.  Eventually they would either leave others shit alone or they would quit the game cause they would be in debt from bounties and not have the resources to repair their broken guns.
---
*Bounty System Logic*
---
So far the whole bounty system is dumb. If a player has 0 caps then they dont care if they have a 200k bounty they are going to just go around messing with other players breaking their stuff and being dicks about it. Let them start aquiring cap debt and losing **THEIR** junk and resources to pay the victim amd the majority of them will rage quit.
---
No. Only if you believe the item is duped. For example if you saw that the player that sold you the dress had 10k of the same dress. Or if it was a super rare item and the player sold it to you for a small amount of caps. You could argue that it always could be an honest player but the point of this isn't accusation but rather to make sure that the other player isn't duping and that you don't get banned for buying a duped item.
---
Lore wise it makes sense - scorched killed everyone a little while ago. Before the vault opened. Although I agree, I feel it could have helped the story to at least find a select few alive survivors. 
---
Also as a game design reason, they said they wanted no confusion between humans appearing in the game. They wanted all humans = real human players. 
---
I feel pretty neutral about the whole thing. I like going around and reading about what had happened in the past and uncover stories. But it also feels like real NPC‚Äôs with any depth were removed for engine optimization reasons. And they created the game design theory to justify it.
---
Well to be fair these unique legendaries drop from quest missions not events. I don‚Äôt however think we need more rewards for events, we just need the rewards from events to be more rewarding. Some offer legendary mobs, plans, ore. But some are just not worth doing at all.
---
NO! DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! MORE JET!
---
At least in FO76 you can only take one drug at a time. Right?  Ugh 
---
*Bad Company theme starts playing*
---
Better to enable full PvP and have friends on standby to guard it.   More engaging alternative.  Nothing should be instanced/locked in an open world sandbox game.  So better to just leave it alone than make this change.
---
Add stairs up somewhere else? Then you can scrap those ones.
---
a "join last world" option would solve this. 
---
Exactly.  Everything else caps at 50.  You need to keep a 3:1 kd just to break even lol
---
It not so much they are forced, Whitesprings was the best at one point, its been nerfed pretty good now.
---
Some people just dont want to try new things or do much outside the meta. Whitesprings is great for 1* and the very rare 2/3* legendaries but gets farmed too often.
---
Im like you, ill get my kicks exploring and adventuring and once I/you notice a legendary spawn, try and incorporate it into  our routes.
---
I read some people use a glitch to get outside the map and run to the final room. If that's true 7 min is possible
---
It would be awesome if HUD were working well over all
---
Thanks for the tip! Adding it to my queue. :)
---
Fair point, I can see that and agree. But at the same time WhiteSpring is pretty boring, rarely show up. I would probably choose prime over WhiteSpring now days just for the prime receivers. Also I know where all the flora is in WhiteSpring like the back of my hand and prime for violet ..
---
No no no, there‚Äôs no need to dish out real money to spend atoms, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm thinking everyone thinks about it wrong! Atoms are rewarded from conpleting in game challenges, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve built up most of my atoms to spend! I haven‚Äôt spent a single dime other than buying the game! I think the only issue is not being able to see those daily challenges! At least there‚Äôs no way to my knowledge... I could be wrong...
---
Only if they actually expanded the emote wheel or allowed us to fully customize what we wanted on it.  The whole sub-selection thing is really awkward.
---
yeah loads well frustrating keeps going on till all enemies are dead and stops all buttons from working !!
---
No, there's specifically named legendary wepons that drop from events. Meteoric sword and the nailer. They are kinda meh so no one talked about them but what OP is saying is already in the game. 
---
Is it not wise to keep the "lore consistent" items found in game only and the "lore breaking/goofy" items in the atomic shop?  
---
That's a ridiculous amount of mods. At this point I'd argue that you aren't paying attention. Like somebody else said in the comments after 2-3 mods you should've learned and became more cautious.  
---
Although I feel your pain, especially for the X-01 jetpack!
---
Pretty nice buy if you ask me.
---
One as somebody with a 500 cap bounty last night  I'm not touching that lol such a trap.
---
Yesssss it flashes like crazy until the enemy I targeted dies! Definitely seen this many times on PS4
---
I wonder if FastTraveling close would help, but than you lose your free FT which stinks.
---
Better than the normal one, just don't shoot too close
---
Well with the right amount of players and a few TSEs you can wreck her pretty well. AA prime does even better, but the only people killing her in under a minute are most likely stacking bobbles.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc and want to learn some legit SBQ strategies first hand add me ign rampantrifleman 
---
had a similar experience trying to get all the mods for the handmade. Super Duper and scrapper are your friends.
---
For this gun yes, the explosive effect adds about 100 to 200% more dps if you have the perks. And we all know how slow and often this gun reloads too so the damage resistance will be crazy good. The other stat is whatever.
---
I just want this mod to be balanced for everyone.
---
I played a game with just " legendary weapons " and I can tell you, at the beginning it was hard to find one, but some months later, only people with legendary were viable in PVP, and it was full drop on death. 
---
BUT, there wasn't 2x sneak damage or SVAV ‚Ä¶ So you still get a chance. Let's see FO76, I really want to love this new PVP mod, but I'm scare. \^\^"
---
Can you at least admit, that SVAV doesn't have a place in a real PVP mod right ?
---
Errr... okay? I'm happy for you lol.
---
If you do kill him, you may just luck out and be rewarded with crystal shards.  Maybe even 6 of them! 
---
That sounds more like it. I havent logged back in since. I'll check it out today. I just figured it had something to do with the server disconnect.
---
Wasn't this fix already announced?  It's like protesting a law you know is repealed effective tomorrow lol
---
This.  Should be able to cycle onto different wheels, not expand and fight with the UI.  Fortnite is a good example of emotes done right.
---
In my mind I see Bethesda and Bioware in a race to get a stable PvE endgame loop. Who wins is anyone's guess at this point. The competition though will hopefully spur some great things for the communities.
---
Yup - like I said Whitespring is my spot for flux stabilizers, only because my prime receiver has an appetite for violet flux which I stay behind in the prime site for after the fights.  Just can't get that volume of glowing/hardened mass and fluids from the prime itself.
---
Seen more nukes hitting here lately. My camp is at the unmarked trapper base east of ATLAS so it keeps getting obliterated lol I‚Äôm all for new nuke zones but I may have to relocate 
---
Yeah but workshops have a much higher chance of being owned than camp spots being taken. You could be left server hopping for ages.
---
And they're basically the same animations
---
Don‚Äôt bulk steel ever it doesn‚Äôt reduce weight 
---
I always liked the "light pillars" that rose from dead bodies in SWTOR. I think something similar (though probably less bright) would be nice.
---
https://imgur.com/a/b1jsRIc
---
Aditcol will fix him right up!
---
What the smurf are you talking about at the end?
---
Except duping isn't a crime. 
---
I was there for the 3\* Grahm!  No joke he had 3 sets of powered gates. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt even thinking like that. I was thinking even just an x on the HUD like Red Dead has. 
---
I'm starting to think it's more about hit detection in general. At times I hit pretty much every shot I line up properly, and never miss a 95% shot in VATS, and at other times I can't seem to hit anything at all with the same gun in any mode. The latter case *seems* to happen more often when I'm already seeing other signs of lag, such as choppy frame rate or enemies either rubberbanding or freezing in place. 
---
I haven't conducted any "scientific" study on it, so I can't know if this is the case or if I'm just periodically unlucky with RNG, but it's enough that it gives me a pretty solid suspicion. 
---
I think they should just create an new UI for emote menu. Don't think they can do much with the exiting one.
---
All the hand scanners are left handed as well.
---
On point 5: should the targeting computer show where players are? If not, than this will not really cause any feel of dread. Someone who wants to launch a nuke cant know where someone is, so 99% of the time the nuke will just drop on whitesprings or sbq because thats where he can make the most profit.
---
Have they said you'll lose weapons and armor now? When it was first announced they said junk + aid but the specifics were still being ironed out.
---
Svav?
---
Yup, Survival mode will be dead on arrival; 90% of ppl don't pvp including me since it doesn't award you with anything over junk unless the other player was griefing. Towing around 9k caps and so much junk that I literally have no incentive to ever kill people or steal their stuff to begin with; game is pretty easy.
---
My camp is at the Morgantown red rocket which is just outside of the blast zone so I'll have a nice view lol
---
Indeed forgot about those, too bad they‚Äôre not on par with the quest rewards(1 star). thanks for the downvote though
---
The closest thing we have is: Thumbs up, "Mraaah! Squeak!"
---
Thanks.  Yeah, the healing effect was a concern for me, though I don't use any explosive perks and with the nerf coming as well, I hope that I won't do enough damage to trigger the healing.  
---
I need to know this guy
---
I routinely help those in need or players who are at lower level.
---
Over the weekend I gave someone stimpaks at Harpers Ferry, another player some adhesive at Whitesprings, and escorted a level 38 out of SQB zone back to Watoga.
---
No thanks Survival server. No thanks!!
---
Must admit don't really miss them in this games context. Finding the players far more interesting in my encounters. 
---
I wish I was so fortunate to test reduced weight guns and reduce gun weight weapons. I‚Äôm sure the perk cards like martial artist and packing light do. 
---
I once encountered a naked man being escorted by two guys in Space suits. I asked what was going on and one of them ends up claiming the naked man was an ‚Äúalien‚Äù and they were bringing him back to their base for testing. Then one of them proceeded to act like he wiped my memory (like in Men In Black) then kept walking. 
---
When did they say it was a misunderstanding? I'm happy to hear that because I was really looking forward to getting one of those at some point.
---
Crack open a nuka cola with the boys and watch the fireworks
---
I'd be real happy with getting this
---
I got one from it
---
Yo I herd someone got jet?
---
Shit, man. I never thought I'd believe in a conspiracy theory, but I totally buy this. Makes me feel like I'm wearing a tin foil hat when I have to question the legitimacy of every comment I read. Even the ones I agree with. There's an episode of HBO's Silicon Valley where they hire a click farm in India to boost their app user count and that really opened my eyes to the possibility that this stuff happens way more than we think. You only need one semi-credible account to make a post and 10,000 others to upvote to frontpage or whatever. I think we kind of jumped without looking into this whole internet/social media/information age. 
---
I see what you mean. I took it for a test drive at the Whitesprings club house and it wore down pretty quick.  Even with 200% repair, I may sit on it until it gets addressed in a patch.
---
I had the same issue except on mine the pip boy was super zoomed out.  I made the mistake of messing with my perk cards thinking the game would load.  Now my explosive card and super duper no longer work.  This includes restarting PC, logging into new characters, etc...  Looks like I got the TSE nerf early.
---
No. But it‚Äôs against the terms of service and so is selling that shit on ebay.
---
As stated in a previous post. Only teammates appear on the map
---
Yeah, I love radium rifles. On my old main sniper build... they would do some serious damage. After a patch, I quit because they were nerfed. Now, I have a feeling if I had a decent 3‚òÜ nodded out, that they would decimate after I played with a 2‚òÜ that I had. Fun weapons overall and congrats on your quest ending my friend. 
---
Let me know if you have a cool 3‚òÜ because I'd definitely go through you to mod it.
---
It honestly does take quite some time to build up atoms though. Especially if they‚Äôre asking for 2,000 for one item. 
---
That's kinda what I was thinking. Second place you get sent to as a level 5 and suddenly there are leftover level 50 glowing things running around wrecking their shit.
---
Well I was able to use my Primed TS Crossbow on the SBQ today. It's very slow to reload even with Speed Demon. It didnt do all that much damage.
---
Maybe I'll put that auto prime on my Zelots Handmade and let u you know how it goes. Got the 10mm and the combat auto prime plans today as well. Just need a good 3* - nuking WS in about 20 mins. 
---
So, like a guild house or something similar? I really like this idea! Any way we can push traction towards Bethesda? Other than the forums? or would that be our best avenue?
---
Watch your weapon mods too. Some weapon mods increase AP use and some decrease it. Dot sights decrease AP cost, larger capacity mags increase reloading AP cost, Armor piercing mags increase AP cost, "quick" mags decrease reloading AP cost. This isn't a big deal on some guns, but on others it makes all the difference because if a gun can't ramp VATS accuracy to the point it hits and gets a kill and banks a critical shot to start and keep a chain of constant critical hits going then that gun is not going to work well for a VATS build. I have a hard time getting hunting rifles and heavy guns to work well for VATS because of the AP cost. Combat rifles and shotguns are great.
---
As head of the NDA, my powerful organization needs innovative minds in order to bring structure to the wasteland. "Drillbutt" will be offered an executive position in the NDA. Alert: Violate the terms of the NDA and you will suffer.
---
This happens to me on PC too.  Except the second loading screen shows level 1 and the spinning vault door goes 3x the normal speed.
---
This is pretty accurate. Some peeps don't grief though. They bang through the main quest, skipped terminals by pressing the button really fast, didn't really listen to hollotapes, beat the queen 50 times and have stopped playing. I know lots of peeps like this but I'd still group them in with the second group you mentioned because the cause is the same.
---
I'm still building camps and having fun scavenging / exploring. 350+ hours and there's still places on the map I haven't been to. Come to think of it I need to get on events. There's a few I haven't done.
---
I don't see what platform, or i'm stupid.
---
Turning away from targets usually stops this for me.
---
SVAV, VATS, you press one key and you can OS everything with the game aiming for you :p
---
Don‚Äôt be this stupid
---
I bought an hunter long coat for thousands caps, and the guy had only one of it, so can i say that i'm fine?
---
yep
---
That's what I was planning on doing! I wanted to take some pics with mothmans dead body, but he sadly disintegrated into ash ): I was hoping I could get a picture with the purple alien, but he would just not die! 
---
Always keep some steel in your stash!
---
I think they bring something different to the game. Some of the script writing for them is hilarious!
---
I do it too, wasteland justice at its finest. The best is when they get mad at you for ‚Äútrolling‚Äù them or ‚Äúgriefing‚Äù them. Meanwhile the other 10 people at the golf club don‚Äôt even want to collect your bounty now because you‚Äôre doing a good thing.
---
Best caps I ever spent.
---
What are crystal shards used for?
---
I had my workshop nabbed by a tse weilding highwayman yesterday and i was instagibbed each time i attempted to retaliate.
---
Wouldnt mind it. Even though someone gifted me a tse fifty cal on christmas eve.
---
Yeah its pretty crappy. I agree it shouldnt be in PvP
---
I see what you did there.
---
SBQ isn't hard. You only die if you are AFK. The hard part comes with wether or not their are lowbies not carrying their weight DPS wise or people just AFKing. Its bad boss design. There should be huge risk of death. Lowbies should die from any glancing damage. 
---
I basically see all of Appalachia as one giant Vault experiment.  It's not so much about the individual people and their stories as much as a slice-of-life tale about a doomed region.  Like a Vault, you can't change the outcome.  You can't reverse what happened.  You can only follow the threads to the inevitable discovery of what went catastrophically wrong.
---
If Appalachia were literally a Vault, its experiment would be about unleashing a virus that slowly corrupts your mind into a population divided by tribalism and watching to see how different groups fought to stop it.  The result is that everyone died because they simply couldn't work together.  They each held different parts of the solution, but they viewed each other with so much suspicion that no one was able to tie it together into *the* solution before everyone was infected.
---
I have no idea. lol, I think they just turn into glass when scrapped.  I've killed 3 of those dudes and never lucked out on anything.  Acid and crystal.
---
Having flashbacks of housing purchases in FFXIV....
---
You just don‚Äôt know how to play the game. It took me plenty of frustration too until I figured it out. There‚Äôs a chance at 1,400 caps per 20 hours. The different wallets are Responders / Raiders / Whitesprings / Enclave / BOS / Watoga / Harpers Ferry. It‚Äôs pretty simple now. 
---
Bobblehead stacking. Still not fixed.
---
I 100% agree!! It takes really does, which is why I think maybe a list of any daily/weekly challenges that is easily reachable for us would make it not only perfect, but faster to rack up those atoms! Granted I‚Äôm not the smartest on how easy that is to accomplish for them, but I mean there are days where I will get 10 achievements, and there are days where I will get 1... so I agree..
---
Every now and then, if the person she is aggro'd on lags out or crashes, she will fly clean off the map. 
---
Class! lol
---
Ah, I see; thanks. 
---
I hope they do, to keep dropping nukes fresh, bosses and special events and stuff like that.
---
Not gonna lie, some screw farming locations would help =F
---
Wait, are the weekly challenges the same for everyone?
---
Some Issues that need to be resolved first:
---
I think the vendor-bot interactions help highlight some of the issues.  If a single player is using a vendor-bot nobody else can until they are done. If this happened with NPC's griefers could just perma-talk to them effectively shutting the quest-line down for those waiting. 
---
Also, how would nuking the area affect those NPC's would it kill them? Mutate them? Leave them unaffected?
---
How about people on different parts of a quest? Could they hear the dialogue from the NPC's either spoiling part of the story or allowing them to skip parts of it (like you can skip some BOS mission stuff if you know where to go)
---
These would have to be addressed first for sure. Would it be neat to have Human NPC's back? Yes! But they need to really make sure they have the above-listed items clearly fixed or expressed to us.  
---
It was easier to use holo-tape and notes. Holo-tapes are only hearable by the player playing it, and notes ensure you follow the correct path while questing (most of the time) and allow other steps to proc AFTER you read the note.  
---
Hope this helped?
---
Right? Simplest shit to complete and cant even do it. As the other commenter said, theyre ruining our incentive..
---
Where is your camp? I've found a lot of mothmen near the savage divded/mire border. I'm more in the middle of the savage divide so I don't get too many mystical visits haha
---
No man it wasn't like that. Yes, I saw he was going at a Grafton monster while (I'm assuming an enclave mission) taking out a ship. I helped him take down the monster since he was essentially just a burden while player was shooting the ship then put my weapon away and begged for his Mercy killing and he just kind of shooed me away like a fly. That's why I had to punch him. He was probably headed inside but I only begged 3 seconds off him. I did manipulate him into helping and for that I'm sorry but it was a hell of a time
---
The weekly and dailys are.
---
Impossible, that is where MY camp is!
---
If the make town areas almost the same as workshops I think it would work. You can place items, defenses, etc.....In fact in the meantime a group could take over a workshop and build it into a faction base!
---
You have to move/place down your CAMP again, and start over when this happens.  I spent a whole day and a half once learning all the stupid CAMP behavior and probably placed the CAMP down at least a dozen times, before having a close to what I wanted vision and finally gave up on perfecting it.
---
Yeah, it's all well and good reading letters and listening to the tapes but at the same time. I miss the interaction with them, because not every other player you meet in the game is friendly.
---
I see where they are coming from though with confusing players. Just feel like the game is missing that little something!
---
True, no way a hunting rifle is going to weigh as much as a missle launcher. 
---
I think I've seen it used for cryolater ammo crafting, but I'm not sure if that was crystal shards or just crystal.
---
Thanks a lot ! :)
---
We'll see this new mod ! But remember it will be in BETA, so as Bethesda says " Nothing is write in stone " :D
---
You get these plans as part of the story missions.  Progress thru the Abbie's Bunker section and you will receive the ability to create them after completing it.
---
"You have contracted tetanus..."
---
"Oh ok"
---
"In your butt..."
---
This would actually create a pretty garbage situation for high level players who spawn high level mobs but have nothing to deal with those mobs. Maybe make starter kits based on level that allow for some non legendary guns and armor that you don't have to make if you're taking away all junk and such.
---
Alternatively to combat the loaded people carrying stuff over, allow people to bring over a max of 100 of every junk type.
---
I think that's just certain guns. IIRC the combat shotgun doesn't benefit from that.
---
Seems good to me
---
I‚Äôm running this with 4 bits of weightless armour and all mutations using a bloodied modded mole miner gauntlet or 3 star weightless power fist. Combined with perks and armour mods you can 1-3 most pve and 1-2 hit in pvp. 
---
wow. You solve the puzzle ü§£üëç^^
---
Are you sure he was really naked or did the server randomly decide he would appear naked?
---
No wonder why I sometimes log on and it says that my camp couldn't be placed ü§î
---
Oh yeah, I'm not in disagreement, I just wanted to chime in with the fact that not everything in the flora is 'untouched'.
---
My explosive shotgun kills basically everything with one shot so the science is pretty easy.... LOL.
---
I can one shot snipe at long range....just point somewhere near the target and shoot and they die. So when VATS say I have a 66% chance at short range my first thought is.....no I have a 100% chance. When my 66% VATS that should be 100% misses 3x in a row something is definitely wrong.
---
It could just be a shotgun issue as that's the only time I've witnessed it so blatantly.
---
Unfortunately I've never found this anywhere but Grahm.  My best advice is to keep an eye out on the market 76 sub Reddit.  Quite frequently people post on there about having Grahm on their server and offer their IGN.  If you don't find gates the first time ask others around if they're sticking by and add them as a friend then hop.  Eventually you'll get powered gates.
---
These kids probably never even heard of EVE Online or what the term CPK means...
---
I want it to be you lose everything. You restart at the Fallout 76 location with a 5 minute buff saying you cant be attacked or attack other players and the journey begins a new. This will create a helluva camp fest but that's what it is. If people flank you, you're screwed. 
---
I loved the post and this is the last hope that would make this a unique and fun game.
---
It was like 300 caps with max c. bargain perk
---
Also the stabilize helps. I had no perks for it so i didnt hit all my shots and was doing minimal damage. 
---
That wasn't me haha. I agree with your statement as a whole, even if your first sentence is misinformed. Anyone above level 50 will only do mire and bog events since those drop the highest lvl rewards. 
---
No one really does uranium fever anymore since all you get is max lvl 40 rewards. The only worthwhile events to do are ones that give rewards that have nothing to do with lvl (powering up a power plant/mama dolces/wise mothman) or the enclave events. 
---
Why would anyone over lvl 50 do an event in the forest to get a 3 star lvl 10 wepon? 
---
About 95% of the time i ever do an event outside of the mire/bog is because i need to go somewhere close and doing the event pays the caps for thr travel cost.
---
About 2 weeks ago I heard some kid ranting and raving about snagging 3 TSEs in the last 4 hours. 
---
And when I say ranting it was more like excited high pitch screaming.
---
And now I got sad :(
---
Haha ok. Anyways [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/1Ftt40t) is a couple of photos!
---
You are the type of player I wouldn't mind tagging along with. I feel this game needs more players like you.
---
If you are on PSN add me up: MrBellyElliot
---
There's a few bad apples out there, but the majority of the players are helpful and friendly.  PvP is such a waste of time for Bethesda, and they don't even realize it.  Not every game needs to be a Fortnite clone to be successful.
---
I feel like there are a lot of pros and cons if I am honest.
---
Wtf did someone on the server sold it there previously?
---
More hazardous still if it was Ophidian. Just saying. 
---
I am trying to max gunslinger perks straight away. Demolitions perk is already maxed. Need fireproof perk still
---
I can't help but wonder what all those springs are for. I mean, the Gustloff VG1-5 which the Radium Rifle is based on has one mainspring, two springs in the trigger assembly, another spring for the magazine release button and a blade spring or two to hold the gun together. Add a magazine spring for each magazine and you still shouldn't reach 13. 
---
Right! I was specifically picking flowers for the weekly challenge. I log in the next day and all my progress is gone! :(
---
Well, yeah, it is. Lock your doors. Who doesn't lock their house?
---
Same as you wandering down a dark alley in a drunken stupor at midnight. You're going to have a bad time, and it's going to be *your* fault. 
---
I want a Princess outfit
---
Same as with doors closing by themselves, the radios turn themselves back on if no players is present in the cell 
---
Yep, happens on xbox, so doesn't seem to be limited to a specific platform.
---
Wasn‚Äôt directing it at you just yelling at this sub for downvoting me every time I try to discuss anything on this discussion board called reddit.
---
You‚Äôre 100% right on the events and Bethesda is already taking feedback on this on the official forums.
---
I would however add distant thunder to your list of ‚Äúdoable‚Äù events since it has a chance to drop power armor part plans for t-51, t-60 
---
Only if it's exposed as a perk you have to take.  Keeping track of your kills is a core RPG skill and some of us work hard at being able to do it well.
---
You don‚Äôt even need to be the one who launches the nuke. There just needs to be a nuke launched on the server you are on that wasn‚Äôt aimed at fissure site prime.  I got that holotape pretty early on!
---
I was just thinking the same thing. Shoot 3 glow flies, they fall in the grass, find one.. 
---
Possibly, though on my other post, someone commented that they had already made them aware on the first day, and they responded that they would look into it. Now the weeks about over..
---
I see your points and they are all very valid.
---
I feel like if you are playing by yourself and not with a group of other plays the game can feel very lonely.
---
I think I just miss having people to talk to and try to get free stuff off of.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of a dick move since you completely hinder their progress at this point: they have no way to survive since the PA is locked at level 15 and the first hazmat suits are in the toxic valley/Charleston.
---
One note with VATS. Wait a moment after entering VATs before firing. When you initially enter it you have a 0% chance to hit, then after a moment it goes up to what it should be. However if you pull the trigger while it still says 0% that shot and every shot thereafter will miss unless you exit VATS, re-enter it and wait a moment.
---
You had me until 
---
&gt; Yes those people who have no business in a nuke zone to begin with.
---
Lets not be exclusionist assholes.
---
Yeah, I'm closing in on 200 hours.
---
I've never intentionally grinded except for a couple levels when I was struggling to get Rank 2 Starched Genes because I had fortuitously gotten a Marsupial mutation.  But I'm pretty sure I've seen the entire map and done the vast majority of events.  The biggest thing I haven't done is finish the main quest - mostly because I have little interest in launching nukes.  I know how it flows though, and I'm at the part where I have to do the BoS stuff in the Bog.
---
I noticed that playing in a low lvl server there is almost no lag at all. When I join the game, I enter a workbench to see if it loads fast, if it does I check the map for the highest lvl character, if the highest lvl is around 100-120 the game will run nice. I once spent a whole 8 hours in a single server without even realizing it.
---
i was in the divide, right by the bee on the map, right on the little stream next to the Site Bravo Launch tube. 
---
I decided i wanted to be closer to Watoga though so i just moved down to the The Devil's Backbone. Didn't think you could build on a named spot but i plopped my house down right next to the flagpole. 
---
You don‚Äôt need an external force to drive away competition. If you have the runway for it, you can lower prices until your competition dies, then buy them out and raise them again. 
---
Even though there‚Äôs aren‚Äôt very many NPCs around walking and talking, I feel like there are still a lot of memorable characters to choose from. My five favorites, in no particular order, might be:
---
- Rose
---
- Grahm
---
- Abbie Singh
---
- Lucy Harwick
---
- Margie McClintock
---
I hope with the other vaults we get new creatures and enemies to face.
---
If that's the case I'm guessing now we'll face something like the spore carrier (foNV) in vault 94
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Spore_carrier
---
I‚Äôve definitely found all of the logs, and all of the diary entries. After the first few they aren‚Äôt highlighted anymore.
---
I'll check it out! thanks :) 
---
I run a fo76 community discord server if you want some people to talk/quest/trade with :)
---
The junk is usually still there but just isn't obvious because it's not marked any more... If you could get to where it was it's probably still sitting there.
---
Unless I've been really really lucky a few times.
---
This is true, yeah either a leveled box with low tier items at overseer's camp with a melee weapon a gun some ammos and armors or limited junks transfer to craft your starting gears.
---
The phantom butt driller
---
I saw two naked men with pink hair and they went into my house and started killing each other.

---
No shit Sherlock.  U obviously didn‚Äôt pick up on my /s on my comment.  
---
It's only 190 caps from Grahm (I have peeks though).
---
That‚Äôs a good theory :) it would be nice if Bethesda gave us an idea about how the DLC would be structured so we would know whether this is the case or not. 
---
This and also:
---
&gt;How about people on different parts of a quest? Could they hear the dialogue from the NPC's [...]
---
That is why Rose is in an instanced location. She reacts to quests and there doesn't seam to be another way.
---
Don't pretend like your comment was sarcastic. It wasn't. You're just stupid. 
---
Send them a message on PS4 dumbass. We don‚Äôt care
---
Yeah, there were heaps 1, 2, 3 star legendary mele weapons. Clown, halloween, stuffed animal outfits too.
---
Alright ;)
---
Did you get a solution? I'm experiencing this now. I also bought from Amazon 
---
Yep that game was brutal. Would need a much bigger stash for that style tho. Eg, you have an average playing items and only bring out your best stuff when the situation calls for it
---
Wth why would anyone vender that üòÇ
---
Well obviously the dupers have more of an impact, they stand to loose more. As for the guys like me who just want to play a game on a somewhat level playing field, aren't in the majority as I can see by the posts on this sub.
---
All I can do is stay away from it, and if the duped items aren't removed then so be it. I'm out 60 bucks and life goes on.
---
Totally! Especially on a game with no pause button.
---
Well thanks, even though I said I'm aware of different factions but I'm level 25 and there is only 400 caps for me at this point. 
---
At least you were making progress haha mine hasnt changed all week üò£
---
Yea switch to Psycho it is a way better high
---
That happened to me for the 1st time on Xbox yesterday. I completely quit the game and still didn't fix it. I quit again and went to manage game, deleted the reserve space and it fixed it, no idea if it was luck or not as it only happened once.
---
Kinda negates the point of PA workbenches and the achievement of getting the plan to build it/learning where there are workbenches to repair your PA in the early game.
---
The amount of people who don't know this is staggering
---
Ah, I didn't know about that (I was lucky enough to get Cham at Lvl 4 and built around it). Another good point, then!
---
Friend played Thomas the tank engine music in AREA while we were traveling along the tracks 
---
Three people joined us and left at their appropriate stations waving us goodbye 
---
It does this on XB1 too. I have lost 5 valuable X-01 mods because of it. 
---
Now you just proved you don't play this game. The Queen is already dead in the server, and everyone moved on farm Whitesprings. 
---
Ive had one and tbh it depends, because with the slow fire rate, any other explosive weapon becomes better. I also didnt have many pistol perks so maybe that can make a difference, just depends on your style
---
In a lot of cases, the game does show you what is going to be scrapped before you craft something. That is not the case when repairing world items like the uranium extractors or anti-air turrets. It just shows how many of each resource it's going to use, not where they're coming from.
---
Oh the name calling.   Love it. Thats how u know u got to someone.  They cant say anything else but insults.  Enjoy ur day!  
---
They could just add an option to mute players.
---
Why you gotta tell them about Bogtown! Man, when I first discovered that place it was never ever empty. Now days I barely bother to check it.
---
To that guy and his party: lemme know if you need another sidekick!
---
This is spot on, the devs at BGS are learning how to make an online game with their engine. This is why most of the suggestions for new mechanics or features are likely not going to be implemented any time soon.
---
This would be cool
---
don't mean to be a buzzkill but they arent that rare, i find them on mongrels all the time.
---
That sounds cool!
---
Unfortunately, I don't really understand how to use Discord if I'm honest. Still trying to work out how to use Reddit properly!
---
I've said plenty with my correct logic in response to your flawed logic-equivalent. Nothing else needed. 
---
Yes, it's very annoying, seems to stop on its own sometimes if I swap weapons or force the reticule of the enemy /lose line of sight.
---
Usually only happens with my gauss rifle when trying to land a crit on a scorchbeast and i get staggered by thier ranged attack
---
My story.....yes there are plenty of stories, but I don't have one. 
---
Fallout 3. Kid leaves the vault to find Dad
---
Fallout New Vegas. Left for dead courier trying to find why
---
Fallout 4. Wife shot and kid taken from cryo stasis.
---
Fallout 76. Left vault to build America. But what's my purpose? I've no real story behind my character 
---
Odd, I could have sworn Excavator didn't have any 'combat' mods, I know you can get motion assisted servos for the torso (mine has them) which makes it give you EVEN MORE carry weight (by upping your str more)
---
What level are you? I can't even think about settling near or in cranberry bog, ive tried to settle in the mire, but everytime i ft home my c.a.m.p was being attacked by a scorchbeast. Also, whenever I step foot near watoga I am mercilessly killed in minutes. I am level 32 though so that probably explains it
---
I was halfway there, so excited I was getting it to register. Got disconnected. It reset completely and flowers were no longer counting. 
---
Turned it off for the week.
---
I cant tell if this is begging or just wishful... hoping.
---
I fell for the same glitch, where the plan is named exactly the same as another. It unlocked the marine dense for me, so I'll keep server hopping, and hopefully get the right one next.
---
You, kind sir, have just avenged Vox, the crazy guy who survived the apocalypse because he remained in his basement, invented and weaponised a way to understand animals because he was so lonely and had noone to talk to, and died from infection after trying to use his invention on a squirrel and getting bitten by this creature.
---
I deeply recommend Someone to talk to Daily quest
---
I've always had a much easier time soloing her than with a group. Never used TSE anyways. Try to fight her off peek hours with your own group of under 4 people and the fight goes 10x faster
---
don't get me wrong, I'm alright with griefing... to a point. I think it can be a fun part of a game, however.. griefing is only worth as much as it does when it's balanced. If I exploit a game's weakness and claim victory, is it really something I should brag about? I mean what's the point of even doing it? It's kind of reminds me of trust fund kids that talk about hard work, and earning their place and their money. Sure, you were born in the right circumstances, is that really something one should be proud about?   
---
I don't know, I mean I learned pretty early that cheating a game isn't a lot of fun, I mean maybe they were new to video games, and haven't experienced the feeling of unearned victory enough to realize how boring it is... then sure, whatever the folly of youth... but if not, they need a better hobby.
---
That's not it - I'm a firm believer in everyone being able to pull their own weight - in game and IRL.  Its not being excursionist at all, as long as they can meaningfully contribute they're welcome to join.  Just don't come expecting a free ride.
---
Just because you‚Äôre aware of it, doesn‚Äôt mean you really get it. Your level is just a number, man. At 25, you could hit 5 of them easily. You‚Äôre using your level as an excuse. Explore more. 
---
Ah, i ment only ones worthwhile to do "outside of the mire/bog"
---
I honestly understand the difficulty in trying to balance events to make it fun and rewarding for low lvl players yet make it engaging enough for high lvl players to want to participate. 
---
I feel like there's no easy way to solve this, since while you do get an end reward for an event, the event itself has guaranteed legendary enemies which makes it more lucrative. Yet these needs to be lvl locked to the zone they are in making some not worthwhile. 
---
Leader of the pack gives 3 lvl 10 legendaries. Uranium fever gives 3 lvl 40 legendaries. The robco robot event (cant remember the name) gives a guaranteed lvl 52 3 start legendary always. 
---
All horde events also give legendary boss enemies but are usually lvl locked to their zone/enemy type.
---
These are some examples of the event giving a better reward then the end reward which cant be as easily balanced.
---
It's from a pretty early game quest that I didn't complete until much later so I managed to get a pretty high level Allrise.  A friend of mine had a much lower level one which I too would have thrown away later on if I had it.
---
Since we are the Raiders, we are not giving a single f about it.
---
There are two in there - Artisan's Corner.
---
I have a bloody radium on ps4 that I'll pay you to mod
---
It was a little tongue in cheek, I admit, however I most certainly am not carrying around THAT much crap that I am full.... so partly full of crap?  Sure.
---
I am patient so if you want to use it I don't mind walking you through it
---
i find going to the map screen gets me out of this glitch during battle, a little risky during queen battle
---
Oh, I understand, this is a new directive. Now we use ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcontrol sampling‚Äù
---
It is a very cool take on it. What would you like to see from the DLC? 
---
Ahh yes.  Good observation.  
---
I wanted less context that would have been more fun
---
While my melee is substantially stronger without power armor on due to unyielding, it's also a lot less survivable. Despite the fact that my toon has basically the same armor in and out of PA. Hidden stats ftl. Same thing for rad resist, I can stack up to 4k and still be taking more rad damage than if I just put on a hazmat suit that gives 1k. 
---
Hidden multipliers are just too strong to give up unless you've got tons of chems to throw away. Hell my toon has a vampiric weapon and healing factor to help keep it topped off but if I'm not wearing PA, I still have to use stimpacks fairly constantly at a nuke zone. Outside of nuke zones I don't really need/want a PA. 
---
Sounds creepy.
---
This! Happens for me as well. Om PC with a decent / midrange computer and Gods own internet speed. Just wait a bit. Check again. Often it will be there 
---
Yes, so far. Just thought the coincidence was "funny"
---
i played with conduits yesterday. could not figure out how to get them to run through walls. 
---
I shall have a look into man!
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Nope, i hardly ever use power armour. And yeah when its stable its ok, but when its bad its awful. They really gotta make it more consistent.
---
The answer to so many of Bethesda's problems is to halve the number of players per server.
---
OTEC was [EVE](http://evenews24.com/2018/01/22/moments-in-history-otec/)'s version of that. The entire (!) control of one bottleneck resource was in the hands of a select few superpowers who formed a cartel to make mad cash. It was impossible to 'go out and mine' unless you were prepared to face down 500+ player fleets. 
---
Now, FO76 is a different game as you can't control flow of a resource and caps are mostly meaningless - a fixed limit on market spots per server could still be exploited (not as 'exploit'-exploit).
---
What if they made the SBQ an instanced event? If you're not a certain level you can't zone in. Since she only spawns in one area it shouldn't be too difficult. 
---
It doesnt. Cant have both at the same time
---
PC
---
The latter.
---
What Myron said, if I recall correctly, was that he had been trying to synthesize the perfect drug (short-lived, nonfatal, instantly addictive...you know, the BUSINESS idea of a perfect drug) when he noticed that the slaves forced to clean the brahmin pens always seemed to have better reactions that the test subjects for drugs he was actually making, and that it was the fumes from their manure that was doing it.
---
That admission‚Äîthat jet is basically brahmin shit in inhaler form‚Äîis as close as Myron ever gets to not taking credit for inventing it.
---
It was hard when I was level 50.  Its not so hard at level 150+.
---
I was a little disappointed when I noticed the New Year confetti item in the shop was just a picture pose.  I‚Äôm getting tired of waves, hearts, and the thumbs up.
---
Agreed.  I cannot remember the last time I said, "Gee, I'd like to fast travel there, but I just don't have the caps." Especially if you equip the Cap Collector perk to maximize your cap stash plundering and then Travel Agent to reduce fast travel costs.  
---
both
---
The fact it works and the weekly doesn't is also quite funny.
---
They said Aid and other items can be lost as well as Junk. Other items in this case could be either Ammo, Apparel, or Weapons. They aren't going to have you dropping Notes or Holos, probably....
---
Which lead everyone to assume that it's going to be possible to drop your weapons and armor. And honestly, all three would really suck to have taken away from you.
---
I lost a ton of junk the other night due to this.. Started to spawn in, froze (with blurry textures, no robots/enemies, etc), and saw my guy die and fall down before the "nuked zone" and environment even loaded in. Someone nearby ran over and grabbed my bag, but it was too late. 
---
I lost all my bulk junk (10 of everything that can be bulked) and it just dissapeared from my camp for no reason 
---
Oh god. I just found a ritual mask yesterday. I would have it on and nothing else and run around finding afk people. When they came back they just saw me naked with that mask with my hands on my hips :)
---
Ahhhhh, that's a shame. I'm on PS4.
---
Ohhh so that would explain the OP gun! Is there still an inventory glitch. I see a lot of people who ask to trade. Is this still broken?
---
Thanks
---
RC

u/LoneVaultWanderer u/kindofsquishy u/ladydevann u/Valseek
---
A couple things here, 1: yes, that is totally exclusionist, just because you feel it's justified doesn't change the fact. Two, while your reasoning is sound that's not what OP said or meant. 
---
&gt; **no business in a nuke zone** to begin with.
---
Everyone has business in a nuke zone. They're pure profit. Don't be so selfish, it's disgusting.
---
I ran into the same issue recentky, and I tried that strategy of building new temporary stairs so I can remove another set. And guess what? I still couldn't remove the original stairs or floors, *and* I couldn't remove the new stairs or the floor/foundation I built for them. I ended up with one foundation and 3 stair cases up to a second floor, and I thoroughly checked piece by piece but every single object was marked not able to be removed. Had to give up and start over.
---
A 1-star rifle with a sniper build can one-shot a player in X01. No bobbleheads, drugs, or food are needed.
---
Any Gauss Rifle, Lever Action, or Dragon with either Instigating, Bloodied, or Two-Shot can be used for a one-shot kill against any Power Armor without cheese.  600DR doesn't have enough mitigation to survive a 1K shot.
---
Currently, you need regular armor with Assassins/Sentinel mods to stand your ground in PVP. Power Armor is for rad resist and carry weight.
---
Did it over the weekend in the morning - the group that did show up wasn't casuals, I wasn't part of the team that launched but everyone that showed up was mid 100s and beyond.  Quick fight but no bobblehead stacking/1-shot BS either, you can tell when that happens.
---
There's also a difference between fight points - if its done from Drop Site V9 outside the nuke area, you mostly just deal with the SBQ and some Scorched.  Fighting from Delta out of the nuke zone will always result in a longer SBQ fight and a lot more spawns.
---
Although i never had nor used one, i'd say go for the pump gun. With the actual amount of damage you should only need to shoot 1 or 2 rounds to deliver a deadly blast. No use to waste ammo.
---
How that will be after the nerf in the next patch, we all have to see.
---
You're not picking up what I'm laying down.. which is kind of expected. I knew people were going to see this as a whine fest.. which yeah, I am whining a bit.. but I think I'm also bringing up a valid point. I mean if people can write dissertations about the evils of microtransactions and how buggy software is the end of humanity as we know it... to much fanfare, then one can bring up a fundamental flaw that affects a large portion of the game's experience. (That strangely, people seem to be mostly okay with). If that makes me a baby, then goo-fucking-goo...  I'd love to actually participate in PvP, but not when it's so heavily unbalanced to favor those willing to exploit the game developers' lack of planning and forethought, with only cursory attempts address the issues... And yeah, if I don't like PvP don't claim workshops.. valid point. But shouldn't that PvP be balanced, and people not get one shot killed in power armor, when they can't in kind? 
---
Yes and quite a lot of health at that. With 3 people it took about 2 minutes to kill her, with 20 the fight barely got done in time. We even had the added bonus of her bugging out and just sitting on the ground unmoving the whole fight.
---
i think i just hit 60 or 61. Wait until you're 50 to do watoga so you can get a max All Rise. 
---
I'm still in the divide right now. I wanted to plop my camp right be Watoga but didnt want it to be constantly attacked. I can take out a SB pretty easily these days but i don't like to have to,  
---
What not to understand there? 7 factions all of them have individual cap od 200 caps.
---
Oh trust me I'm exploring and I almost never fast travel and that's the problem, I like to play that way but I'm leveling up and collecting bunch of stuff but cannot sell it or craft more of stuff in my base because of all sorts of restrictions and limits.
---
When the duping glitch is fixed, reset the accounts of dupers, that would fix that glitch
---
what
---
Not for that reason,u dont get reward for playing cod/cs:go/battlefield. I dont like to lose 180caps cause of my level and even if they remove this on survival. I do not want to kill ppl in 10+shots. Oneshoting is best feel ever. Few mins ago i was doing monster mash with some randoms guys i it was frustrating when i hit him, but he survived and i was waiting for fucking reload of hunting rifle. He could easily spray me with handmade. Let us oneshot everyone!!!
---
I had someone walk in on me in Bravo, on PC, yesterday. I was in Camo X-01. They politely left. I launched, and saw them again down by Watoga, outside the blast zone, between the high school &amp; train station, as a redditor was paying me for doing the nuke run.
---
I hid in the bathroom at Charleston station so I could go AFK for a few mins, when I came back there was a paper bag by the door with 2 rolls of tp and a tesla science magazine. 
---
So, this only happens to me when:  
---
1. I am in power armour
---
2. I have targeted an enemy in vats, shoot, and another enemy intercepts the bullet.
---
Same issues you guys are describing, stays spamming vats until enemy is dead **OR**  I race the vats spam with my own circle (or whatever cancel vats is for you) button spam.  
---
The circle spam generally cancels the vats and about 50% of the time I end up in the pipboy, but its been a good workaround for hectic fights where I cant wait for the map.
---
It is so strange to see ‚Äúolder‚Äù and ‚Äúfallout 3‚Äù in one post. Yeah it‚Äôs been years since, but I always think about f1-2 when someone claims to be older franchise fan. 
---
And that's why I tell my faction mates to carry and use an endangerol syringer in all of those fights! (reduces DR by 25% for 2 min)
---
I think my emojis are fine. I thought it would make for a fun thread, but I guess I was wrong.
---
Move along, please. Nothing to see here, I guess.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't be worried about it. 
---
If you go to the golf club to blow up houses don't complain when you have to blow up houses.
---
I dont know how significant you are after but I have a 3* two shot handmade with +50 limb damage and -25% VATS cost. Pretty sure 25% is the best you'll get. 
---
Oh Lawd, I hope not.  If hitting the robots in whitesprings is an indicator of how much of a liability I will be in a team...
---
I've died plenty of times to adds peek-a-booing my explosive weapon XD
---
There should always be the availability of PVP but only as a playable option not something that is turned on all the time. Co-op should also be an option as well so that friends can play together and enjoy the same experience. I am more a single player type person cause I don't get how someone can snipe me using a hand gun from 1000yd away..... 
---
If more NPCs are added to the game expect the same level of interaction you get from the two already there, Rosie and Graham.  They were practically at that level of interaction in Fallout 4.  ‚Äò76 cuts to the chase of where Bethesda is taking the franchise.  
---
Everyone needs to carry their own weight - don't be such a bum and expect to be carried by others.  Its not me being selfish, its about individuals being respectable and contributing members of society and not bums.
---
Well sonfa biscuit. thats a perk i will equip for the future nuke runs.
---
I have an anti armor gatling that tears thru bloateds.
---
The spawn rates are based on how many people are in an area so it may seem amazing one time and then terrible other times. 
---
Alright, THAT is a cool build.
---
people are seriously downvoting a call for accountability on Bethesda's part... am I crazy here, am I the only one that thinks PvP is fucked? Bizzaro I love you
---
randomized loot is fine, but there should be other way's of getting mods
---
Problem #1: People jumping in front of you to PvP while you are shooting mobs.
---
Reddit Answer #1: This is griefing, swap servers and report them.
---
Problem #2: People shooting mobs.
---
Reddit Answer #2: Jump in front of them so they shoot you and die.
---
Sorry. Still sort of new to the game. Where are Rosie and Graham?
---
Yeah, I also think the Damage mitigation needs to be addressed in pvp. A normal weapon that deals let's say 10HP should really be 2 or 3 on a person. the Assassin weapons could really Amp that dmg up.. but a shotgun versus full combat armor still shouldn't one shot anyone and when VATS comes into play for head shots.. without meds that increase vats.. it should be very low u less you have a lot of perks into it. It would have to be fine tuned hardcore. This game could be good but they release content and patches so slow that by the time it could be a decent game the meta of fallout will have passed and people have already moved on to Anthem for the most part.
---
Thanks for the info. I thought I saw some other ballistic weapon with 90% reduced AP cost, but I could obviously be wrong.
---
I've been begging people and scrapping combat armour just for that infamous dense mod. Literally 10 minutes ago I found it on watoga vendor. Didn't even know it was sold there. Now I just need armourer rank 3 and my quest is complete.
---
As an alternate option 3, change the worthless radiation perk to a percentage instead of a flat 10/20/30/40.  It could be a 20%/40/60/80 percentage rad immunity with no power armor on.  This would be roughly the same effect of the hazmat suit for 4 perk points and falls in line with the other "without power armor" perks.
---
Outside of the broken weapons, this is probably my biggest pet peeve in the game currently.
---
They need to make the TSE nerf more realistic around 20-30% as being able to do large damage to the SBQ's wings gets her to land a lot faster.
---
For the record, the main damage in SBQ fights come from instigating melee weapons from folks in power armor. Most of those users are pointing at ranged and screaming in order to camoflage their own busted damage.
---
I wonder how many folks will quit. I know I have.
---
Hope it‚Äôs ok that I share it, here‚Äôs by rifle build balanced for survivability, stealth, crafting, and QOL/carry weight. 
---
It has some crit components to it but isn‚Äôt necessarily a min maxed crit build.

And a video of the build in action where u can see the vats/crit gameplay in action 
---

---
I prefer the combat, because it has more modifications than the pump. Quad double barrels are cooler though. Pump has terrible fire rate.
---
RIP D:
---
Fantastic review! I have to agree, with the movement options more than anything. The amount of times I've wanted to go prone and been frustrated that I can't is uncountable.
---
Happy wandering traveller

I couldn't find him for weeks. My friend grabbed and held him 2 day in a row though, and I finally got my gates, and a bunch of other stuff.
---
I'm going to expand on the Sugar Grove thing a little. There are 3 locations in close proximity that you should hit. All 3 have the radio telescope icon on the map. The Isolated Radio Array, National Radio Astronomy Research Center, and Sugar Grove. They are within easy walking distance, and adding the other two stops will dramatically increase the number of screws/springs per server hop. 
---
Rosie is in the Savage Divide, part of the main storyline.  Graham wanders the hills selling rare plans with his trusty partner Chally the moo-moo.
---
Good question, but Just curious: what base damage do u think this gun has?
---
I've had several TS weapons, and none are anywhere near capable of denting a SB.
---
Paints
---
Ha, what?!
---
The emote makes it
---
Had a legendary glowing radstag spawn by my camp this morning as well. Had to do a double take at the loot, lol. Iirc it was a 2* or 3* armor piece. 
---
I mean, yeah, if they make the "Adventure" servers just PvE, but they aren't.  even if they did the PvP servers would still have waaay less players than the PvE servers.  I still think it would be better to just have the one server, don't want to PvP, turn on pacifist, which as I said before, should be full pacifist, you hurt no one and no one can hurt you...
---
Was hoping you could join us XD Well you still can but it would only help with advice/people to talk to!
---
Combat has the 38 and 45 receivers but is rarely above 350 in damage. Good imo for saving ammo and just wandering with. 
---
The pump is close to 450 on the norm and for glowing ghouls at WS is a 2 shot kill unless you have full shotgun perks or glowing sights. Or are willing to get close enough. Then it‚Äôs 1 shots all day. 
---
I really thought I‚Äôd use the combat more but the handmade still offers a better edge in battle.
---
I've gotten lucky before and seen stuff like hardened mass and ultracite, trailing just after another, higher level player doing a vendor run. If you've already got an elite-level weapon, well, its not like you need 2 or 3 others. You can use some of the trading sites to unload them for 5,000+ caps, but I doubt players in the 150+ levels need caps that much anyway. 
---
just lol :D
---
It happened to me 2 times already. 
---
I have both and have to say I much prefer my combat shotgun.
---
 The pump does a bit more damage and I'm fairly sure the spread is narrower and accuracy is higher but the combat responds alot faster. Is quicker to reload, holds more rounds and is my go to for shotgun use.
---
Ok
---
Well the good news is I killed them both twice.. ended up breaking even lol
---
Love it ! Well played !!
---
Both are shit when you don't have skeet sagittarius perk cause they have a horrible precision 
---
hahahaha :)
---
you can't have a pvp free town until I have a pvp free camp ;)
---
poopoo butt üòé
---
TBH I don't get why they sell emotes or poses...like I understand why people *want* them, but I'm unsure why Bethesda wants them locked behind a payment (even made with in-game earned credits).
---
They seem to understand that they want to encourage people to take photos (daily and weekly challenges make this evident) so that their game gets free buzz and attention....but don't want to give more than 2 poses away for free? Makes 90% of photos very stale. :(
---
And emotes are all about communicating with clarity! There aren't even some basic emotes that would make life easier sans-mic...but I don't think *selling* communication methods is helpful either, just ham-strings anyone not investing in them...plus ones that are non-standard are inherently less clear to others who do not have them/have not seen them before.
---
I think they should be selling actual "premium" things. I think the costumes and CAMP items and even the icons make sense. Everyone will think this suggestion is along the lines of Fortnite, but it's really inspired more by MMOs: SELL A DANCE. Sell dances or other *animations* for idling or celebrating or whatever.
---
I was waiting around for my partner to finish prepping at his CAMP and my MMO brain goes *I'll just dance while I wait* and then I remember I'm in FO76. :/
---
60% for 9 perk cards, like all the weapon damage perks.
---
But.... TS doesn't lend itself to VATS very well at all (due to reduced accuaracy).. which is what low AP usage is good for.     
---
You would be better off asking for an Armour Piercing with Reduced AP costs.    
---
Also... to keep AP costs down don't pimp your gun out with all the 'best' mods. Just the best receiver and maybe a scope to increase VATs accuracy. 
---
nice :) i want one...
---
i agree, and have thought a lot about this. i think the world should be at least semi dynamic. it has to be for the game to stay around as long as they want it to. It doesn't make sense that you kill the scorchbeast queen and things just continue as they were. the idea is that we are rebuilding society. once you beat the scorchbeast queen, you should have the option to carry your character forward in the storyline. these would be different servers with the map altered to reflect the state of WV in the timeline. Personally, in my dream 76 world, I'd like to see them add the vaults to the map as it is. let everyone complete those quests. in at least one of them, we should find humans. humans that have seen what's on the other side of their vault door and have retreated to hiding. once you defeat the SBQ, you should be able to go back to them and say that the scorched is done, and here is where it would throw you into the new servers if you so choose. There could be maybe a short time jump featuring a cutscene where scorched begin to die off, scorchbeasts start falling out of the sky, and people have emerged and began rebuilding. certain locations can have small groups of people beginning to settle with small camps, maybe some hung back in the vault, and now when you enter it, they are cleaning up and rebuilding in there. there could maybe be occasional occurrences where you come across a group of humans that get into it with some local monsters (like the BoS or synths in Fo4). the quests you get at this point could be in the interest of moving and harnessing the inoculation technology, making places habitable, and cleaning up the remaining scorched - scattered few and far between. maybe scorchbeasts become weakened from the defeat of the Queen, making them susceptible to the strangler mutation/parasite/disease. this could change the way they behave and attack. the aftermath of the nukes could also have some sort of long lasting effect on the already existing creatures, birthing a new boss-level threat. this shift could even touch on some of the inhabitants breaking off and becoming raiders. this would add definition to the faction. they could be in tattered, dirty and bloodied vault jumpsuits with raider armor. they would replace the scorched (for the most part) and could also be another potential source of quests. here is where we can begin teaming up with factions that begin rebuilding with the survivors. fast forward to "chapter 3," once the final major quest is finished for "chapter 2's" world (months after release), the next expansion/shift can occur. another cut scene, another time jump, but a major one. maybe 20 years or so this time? the scorched have been completely eliminated, but raiders have replaced them. They have since multiplied by reproducing and travelers from neighboring lands. at this point, under the leadership of Rose, they stormed whitesprings, destroyed most of the robots, while utilizing the remaining as defense for their new home. whitesprings can be a new stronghold/dungeon for raids. the vault dwellers that assembled to uphold the beliefs of the BoS have now grown as well. maybe fort defiance is completely cleaned out and fully operational. other, neutral societies, have grown and built hubs in either one of the vaults, or the top of the world, or somewhere else. during this chapter, the other major conflict could be the enclave finally arriving to reclaim what they believe is theirs, utilizing creatures under their control, maybe some new beasts they created with the FEV. each chapter could feature new or transformed creatures based on the actions of the last, always switching up the gameplay with a new threat. the level scaling could also change. whereas the forest was the starting area for chapter 1, you may start at the top of the world, or somewhere where people have begun rebuilding in chapter 2. that would be the "low level" area for that chapter, and the order in which they scale would shift as well. 
---
i know my idea is pretty ambitious, but for the most part is doable. the main idea is that the overall driving narrative needs to shift, and environmental changes should come along with it. the playing field should change, the enemies should change, and things that we did in the first leg of the game should impact it's future. they could even do something akin to fortnite's "seasons." every however so often (idk i don't play) the season changes and something happens in the storyline that alters the gameplay/playing field for the season, with a cutscene introducing it. *something* needs to be done. this game wont last the remainder of the year if they just leave "repeatedly nuke the SBQ" hanging in the background for us to relive that part of the story in a never ending loop.
---
The difference in damage at that level is really insignificant. They both fire 2 shots and explode. Not much can take 1 hit, nevermind 3! (Excluding the health bar bug which refills enemies health)
---
 Combat has alot more mods and has a higher ROF, the right amount of spread and can hold upto 12 rounds. 
---
Ron Perlman was wrong...war HAS changed. 
---
I am going to have to hunt down and find Graham!
---
Gary, Gary...
---
That would be 90% weight reduction. 
---
Gee, thanks man!
---
Means a lot to have other people wanting to play alongside me!
---
That might very well be true.
---
Oh lord!
---
Excellent choice, man
---
"Alexa, set volume to 11"
---
Like I said, you should be able to choose what you want, so if you take shotgun perks then that's what you get. To make it possible, have a vendor bot at the overseer camp. Give everyone a single weapon voucher(that comes with a limited amount of ammo), an armor set voucher (limit sets to things such as raider, metal and leather) and consumable/junk voucher. Make it all scale with your level.
---
The last one is debatable, but if everyone needed the same mats, then everyone would farm the same couple of places like sugar grove, which would turn into a campers dream. People would just chill at sugar grove entrance with a party, wait for others to come out and ambush them, take all their stuff and stash it at a nearby base. Rinse repeat. Strongest team gets to camp sugar grove.
---
I don't understand why the SBQ has scaling health.  That's silly for an end-game boss.  It should require the same effort no matter what, so you actually have to get a solid team together to meet a minimum requirement, and then other randos don't affect anything.
---
I'm just really curious why it scales.  To allow solo players to kill her?  Or to prevent 24 from killing her too easily, which I don't see as a problem?
---
&gt; energy weapons should be int based giving people a reason to use them if they are crafters and such ect ect 
---
I have crafting INT Build and I am okay with your solution
---
The mechanic of her health scaling up based on number of people who have engaged her in combat.  You know, the thing we are talking about?
---
You can stack rad shield and radx diluted?
---
"Boy the roads are long to here. Lost more than I‚Äôd care to admit I‚Äôll tell you th... oh hold on a second... new player..." *dies*
---
*comes back to life* "so, yep... roads were long and stuff, so anyway, how‚Äôre you?"
---
No he didn't, he clearly stated DO NOT NUKE THE AIRPORT. It only spawns scorched 
---
I think it depends on how you play.  If you live in power armor then you probably never die.  So when you do randomly die once in awhile it never seems like a big deal.  If you try to do something like a nuke silo without power armor and no over powered legendary weapon, you can definitely die and its super annoying running back through the building.
---
I can‚Äôt remember. If a TS can‚Äôt damage an SBQ (I‚Äôve taken down several normal SB‚Äôs with my standard Handmade), what can? Does it really have to be TSE? It seems that heavy weapons are crap, so they‚Äôre out...
---
Even if you had to adhere to a very strict size parameter (2x3 foundation?) and your specific "slot" wasn't permanent ie. if you had a spot in a TOWN you could spawn in a lot on the East side and on next log-in on a new server you spawn in a slot on the West side because the other slots are already occupied when you joined.......I would really like this. I have a CAMP I spend a lot of time working on and I know like only 1 or 2 people will ever see it. :(
---
It's not at all hard to get a hazmat suit.  That logic falls flat on its face immediately.
---
That looks like the new shoulder mounted rocket mod.
---
I had no idea that AP cost had anything to do with the amount of mods a gun has ü§£
---
Why doesn‚Äôt everyone just install them as they get them? That what I did and I don‚Äôt have a problem.
---
Bloodied sounds like a terrible idea.  People will be dying left and right trying to pump their DPS.
---
Already quite a few NPC's in this game. Not sure why so many people are blind and stupid.
---
Sounds fair to me, I like the idea of the vouchers 
---
Meow. Lol
---
A few people swear by it but most would say all normal energy weapons suck ass in FO76. Me being one of them. The plasma gatling breaks way too fast and it just has sloppy aiming for my liking. Plus the plasma cores just take up precious stash space. 
---
You explained what i wanted pretty well but looking at downvotes of this post shows that almost no one liked the idea
---
Well there's no need to be rude now is there?
---
Shit i'm trying to tame everything with no success...and i have lvl 3 animal friend.
---
man i get so sad that dayz unleashed never went anywhere, we never get a name drop :(
---
How the fuck have you not learned to avoid this?  I know it's a problem and people talk about it daily and I know it will get fixed, but if you've lost dozens of mods then you're being incredible dense.
---
That might have been me. My first time trying to launch a nuke ended up with me not knowing the last step needing to be deciphered.  Had the nuke card and all the code pieces and figured the last part was in the silo. Got a little frustrated after googling it and just logged off for the day. I did end up making some decent exp so it wasn't all for nothing.
---
Easy - pay x caps to buy a plot of land. Each time you load in, your house will just be on a random plot in that town. You are given a 2x2 or 4x4 (or whatever) in a neighborhood and you are given a mailbox. The mailbox is a system where players can rate other players homes. Like animal crossing happy home whatever. Also Graham or a new trader will frequently visit or wander the town selling basic building materials. Contractor man? And at the end of the week, you get some fun rewards if you have a positive ranked house(plans or junk?). Less likely to be a thing on pvp servers ( unless they make it a non pvp zone). But deffinately something that can happen on pve servers. 
---
I consider the T60 to be the best overall, due to it's Ballistic/Energy/Rad resistance balance, durability and repair costs.
---
How do you sit like that?
---
I've ended up with an abundance of screws, gears, and adhesive after chasing them for a long while.  
---
Now I'm chasing springs, lead, and fusion cores.  
---
I've figured out springs (clipboards).  
---
I'm thinking that I need to set up a lead extractor for lead while still checking out the best spots (usually emptied).  I would normally just take over one of the munitions factories but they are always taken and I'm not into PVP.
---
I've figured out fusion cores but I'm not sharing simply because I don't want my spots to become popular.
---
get this all the time on my PC and my Xbox
---
Could be a nice add imo
---
You can skip the reactor part by unlocking a door to the left of the rad shower. I know that doesn't help you with the disconnects but that shaves off about 5 min. 
---
Currently we're down to 1 (empty, vague) post per week.
---
Were not getting a patch this month, well probably be lucky if we get any new information in the ITV other than a few bug fixes being pushed out 1st or 2nd week of Feb at this rate.
---
The game made no money and Todd doesn't feel its worth looking at customers at this point. 
---
Next ITV will probably say something like, "Were looking forward to sharing more info with you about Beta mode soon, oh and btw we fixed AZERTY keyboards"
---
Bethesda = Joke
---
Hits a chord doesn't it?
---
&gt; Its not me being selfish
---
Yes it is, just like the leechers are being selfish. If you can't see that both sides of that argument are selfish then I don't know what to tell you. The only way to not be selfish here is to stop thinking about others and do what you can do.
---
I like t51 for the ballistic defense.  I usually play in a team and share rad sponge, so the resistance isn't as much of an issue.
---
It's a Photo Mode pose.  
---
I use my old garage band microphone it has a USB and plugs in to my controller slot. I just put it on a mic stand next to the couch. Didn't spend a dime haha
---
I can usually be found dressed in the mechanic‚Äôs jumpsuit fixing park benches in the middle of nowhere with my drill. Good for laughs.
---
He simply had assassin and sentinel armor on, probably fireproof perk as well.
---
I've been very cautious since the first time, but with Uranium Fever and crafting workshop items it doesn't tell you that it's scrapping something, just shows the material requirements, and it's not even that I've run out of steel (look at the title) it's just prioritising scrapping mods for some reason.
---
Damn, I wish you were on PC. I have a quad explosive radium rifle that is just begging for an automatic receiver.
---
Only if it's the last way for it to get the materials.  I've had mods that scrap to steel sitting in my stash for weeks while I craft a ton of stuff that uses steel.
---
Bulking up your steel makes it more likely to happen, too, since it will use loose steel first.
---
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
---
What system are you on? For cheap but reliable PC headset, I recommend Logitech. 
---
use the Syringer with Endangerol
---
Kancho man!
---
Sometimes you run out of space, and don't have time to do/wait on a player sale.
---
Duping aside, your idea about the potential of creating a real trading system in game seems real interesting to me. 
---
It could be something as simple as having the ability to create signs that can be left in different locations. The signs state what item(s) you have and the cost. People then see the signs and come find you to buy. That lets you keep playing instead of sitting in a ‚Äústore.‚Äù
---
Drilling people in the ass? To some, that's living the dream.
---
Why are you blaming Bethesda for this?
---
50% melee damage back is pretty powerful. Imagine someone with lower health than you hitting you, and dying because of it. Personally, I would have kept reactive plate, but I found T51 stealthboy plans. Crouched invisibility is better I think because no one knows what's going on.
---
I think the X01 looks the coolest. And if Dark Souls taught me anything, that's all that matters. 
---
Yeah true. But even so there weren't as many hackers 
---
I suspect that short barrels have a lower AP cost over long barrels too. 
---
I read it depends on the mobs that are spawned there. If you show up and its already full or scorched, nuke it. If it has dogs or molemen then it will be a bust
---
Cool, but if he goes Legendary during a Nuke, I would have to put him down.
---
Agreed, perhaps adding for than one event for each range of levels for legendary loot. And then giving each event a status tool tip with the current time remaining and the recommended level. 
---
I think more events (for variety of the task and the loot) and rewards bigger than a purified water and some 40mm grenades would entice people to participate in more events. 
---
Not since the initial post when they discussed it.
---
Slap an ivory handle on that big boy.
---
I have 23 plans for it if you need one.
---
For the SBQ every person there increases her hp.   Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre low level or high,  doesn‚Äôt matter if they leave her hp jumps up.
---
If they can‚Äôt dump in enough numbers to counter the fight becomes frustratingly ‚Äúhard‚Äù.
---
Funniest shit ever. lol. That should be a signal from now on in the community that you just want someone to end it for you.....being in nothing but underwear. 
---
Against my shotgun perks and power armor? It's a two shot explosive shotgun, over 450 damage. And he dropped me in X-01 power armor. 
---
Rapidly tap up on D-pad until it brings up your quick wheel, that fixes it for me every time.
---
He's in it to grind
---
I would probably end up killing it out of reaction, then read your sign and be like...Fuck!
---
Yeah, the prioritisation is the most annoying part about it! It's understandably frustrating especially during events while in the heat of the battle
---
I really think it'll be meta in pvp
---
Oh,btw, I'm on PS4. 
---
That was sarcasm btw. Ofc there is good stuff, but honestly, they could've done much more.
---
That doesn't mean he is a duper...
---
I vote a hard yes. In your underwear with no weapon means "kill me please"
---
I hadn't heard of a fix announced until someone commented, if that's the case then great but it's well overdue and has already cost me plenty.
---
I have had a similar experience. Meanwhile WS seems to have a higher base rate of legendaries  in general...
---
I agree with Daakison's post.
---
Sorry....terrible spelling and sentence structure.  I will work on this.  ü§£
---
After 2 months of the same bullshit, yeah, there is.
---
Hah! I've got the same issue with items in my stash awaiting the mode.
---
Playing the game causes you to accumulate stuff.   When you are fighting large groups of mobs you don't have time to sift through their crap.  You have to pick it all up and the sift through it later.  Ergo being able to carry more without being over encumbered is important.  Even if you don't hang onto everything, you still have to manage it and reducing the frequency that it has to be managed means you can spend more time playing the game and spend less time playing "inventory manager".
---
PS4. But I will check in to Logitech. I'm sure they make some for my console. :)
---
It depends what you have. Decontamination showers require 1 of each flux to repair. Hours of farming to fix a couple shotgun blasts.
---
My man I want that thing so bad. Jesus. I'm using a full pistol build and the best thing I have is a level 40 bloodied explosive faster move when aiming combat shotgun. Too bad I don't use shotguns.
---
I'm sure there will be two answers: people hoarding them to sell them (which I have no sympathy for) and people buying them for armor they don't have yet (which I have a little sympathy for).
---
The number of times this has happened to OP makes me completely unsympathetic.
---
You said it, man.
---
I have tons of steel, it shouldn't matter where it's stored. Especially as junk takes up massively more space in stash than on your character because of perks not applying in the stash
---
STOP!
---
The only way to identify a "duper" is to catch them actively duping. People have powerful weapons and perk and armour combos can be extremely effective at negating all kinds of damage. 
---
If you feel this person has possibly exploiting glitches to be so powerful, then report them and let Bethesda sort it out, STOP calling everything you don't understand a "duper".
---
Does he stay after server hop?
---
I accept low 40s in those rare places with loads of objects becacuse i cap my fps to 59 and even though I'm 120hz it makes low 40s not seem too bad (remember most movies are 24fps). Its worth the detail for me. The stutters are gone which was the main thhing for me.
---
The fix is to make  iTextureMipSkipMinDimension=256 or 512, this will make some objects blurry but you can enjoy ultra textures for everything else. You should also try  iTextureQualityLevel=0 or 1, this had huge increase in fps for me - main thing is quantity of objects and grass density
---
Because there are lots of ghouls there that gave a lot more XP before the latest nerfs.
---
I am referring to strangler bloom, a necessary ingredient for rad shield.
---
Sweet. lol. I'm an old drummer myself. 
---
I mean jet is in Anchorage, this argument should have been settled 10+ years ago but it still comes up. Just like pipe weapons in safes, because people making home made weapons in a time when the government was in war and annexing our neighbors is totally inconceivable.
---
Yes. We need them.   
---
The game is unpleasantly empty without them.

My conspiracy theory is that they got they wanted to put loot boxes in this thing, but saw the fallout (heh) from EA screwing up Star Wars Battlefront 2 with them to the point of getting them banned in Europe. So the publisher ordered them pulled out, recalculated their expected revenue from Fallout76 and went "crap" when they realized it might not bring in as much as they were hoping. So they slashed the studio's budget BEFORE they started bringing in voice actors. So the studio adjusted their plans, hired a small skeleton crew of voice actors, and trimmed out as many NPCs as they could and pushed the game to release before it was 100% ready (note the lack of key multiplayer game features like a text chat). 
---
Like I said though, this is all conjecture. I'd love to see a comparison of how many voice acting lines are in 76 vs 4, as that'd support or kill my theory really fast.  
---
I mean the map is fantastic. A LOT of time, effort and love went into it. Same with the monsters. BUT the game kinda falls apart when you look at the quests and NPC interactions. It really feels kinda...half finished. The "all npcs are humans" line that Howard gave makes no sense really. They have ghouls in game, so why not have ghoul NPCs? Or more complex robot NPCs, like Codsworth, or Curie or K-L-EO? 
---
Combat SG has a higher DPS rate, and better capacity
---
Pump SG has slightly better per shot Damage, better Range, &amp; better accuracy
---
Man, I am sorry, but if you have really lost THIRTEEN mods to scrapping, dude that is on you. 
---
Yes, it is dumb, yes it needs to be fixed, yes it is incredibly mind-numbingly stupid this is even a problem. but at this point it is very well known.  man you need to stop button mashing! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me Thirteen times... well. 
---
Hence why I'm asking reddit for advice before reporting, I want to be sure. I don't like to jump to conclusions, but with that high of a bounty and him attacking first, something seemed amiss. 
---
I thought SQB had high base resistance to explosives? 
---
How would you suggest avoiding it when I have plenty of steel on hand and I'm using normal game mechanics to build things which don't give an indication of where materials are coming from like workbenches do?
---
But thanks for the insult.
---
No headphones with your phone?
---
Most of the work with the jack in the bottom of the controller :)
---
The key is to check their inventory. Someone could have multiple copies of things that were duped by someone else and they got through legitimate trading afterwards. However, a strong indicator that they are actively involved in the duping is if you see the guns *stacked* in their inventory, as this tells you the guns are the exact same item in the exact same condition with the exact same mods.
---
Im coming online now if your ready
---
a true hero 
---
That should have come with a cheap one, right? They look like headphones but have a volume control with a tiny hole (mic) on the back. If you don't have those, you can always use ones that come with any good smartphone these days, or just buy a set.
---
Nbd. Xp is good too. 
---
But I got two 100+ so now I'm grinding gear. 
---
I'm going to attempt a healer spec, with a medic pipe that I found, but that character is level 20 something. 
---
So it's good to know more areas for xp. Thanks! 
---
OK, I was talking about VATS in general, not just with shotguns. When it comes to deciding which shots hit and which don't there are a lot of factors involved such as the weapon's inherent accuracy, your character's skill (decided by things like Agility and Perception as well as certain perk cards), the weapon's range stat and so on. 
---
If you shoot at something with a shotgun, but the target is outside the gun's optimal range, you essentially get a "debuff" to your hit chance. It's a bit more complicated, but I don't actually know the specifics of how it's done in Fallout. If the gun's accuracy is low, you also get a lowered hit chance, and a lowered hit chance means that you can  miss a shot you lined up really well, because the game calculates that your character / the gun itself isn't good enough that you would make the hit. Again, more complicated but these are the basics. With every gun, not just shotguns, there's also the issue of spread or bloom, i.e. how much the projectiles deviate from the ideal trajectory you aimed along, and that is also influenced by different factors. 
---
In VATS, however, the hit percentage you are given *should* be the actual chance you have to hit. It never goes above 95% unless you activate a Crit, which makes it 100% = a guaranteed hit. That means that you can still miss a 95% shot, but it's very unlikely. 
---
If you consistently and repeatedly miss even 95% shots, it seems likely that it's because of something more than just bad RNG luck. Even with a 66% chance, you should statistically hit two of three shots, so if you miss all three shots repeatedly, again, there is likely some other issue as well. I suspect it's on account of some kind of latency. 
---
Fireproof 3 almost negates all TSE damage, add in dense chest mod with sentinel and you‚Äôre nearly immortal in PVP. 
---
I found rachel, set up a CAMP nearby to craft a recon scope, attached to to my hunting rifle, completed the glitchy quest, and was disappointed with the rewards. I wasted time and resources. I don;t know if there is a chance for good loot, but I got some xp, caps, junk, purified water, and something else
---
War, war never changes.
---
Robobrains?
---
Where did you find him? All I ever find are lvl 21s that are tameable. I can‚Äôt ever seem to find the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù lvl 91. 
---
You don't need advice. If it seems off, report it. If they are cheating in some way, Bethesda has the ability to find out, and if they aren't, Bethesda will also know. 
---
There is absolutely no bad repercussion to reporting someone, just do it and let Bethesda sort it out.
---
They haven't said anything, but if you have a RL friend you trust, you should make a mule to hold your stuff you want to sell. It would free up lots of space
---
i have both, with the pump being a 3*, reduced weight. I have been carrying both because i cant decide either. as others have said, combat has better mods and fire rate. pump has seemingly better spread, and maybe damage? though im not sure. the fact that my pump is reduced weight muddies the water even further. i will say that, naturally, i end up using the combat shotgun more.
---
 Hey now, don't go talking crazy. 
---
Agreed it's definitely annoying.  Just pointless for people to keep upvoting these topics right now lol
---
I got some of these marine wetsuit, ultra light build marine, and a few others.
---
Power is armor is trash in PVP.  Wearing it highlights you as a soft target.  
---
Ok, so in that situation, go with armor reduction or armor piercing.
---
I meant OP, anyway I already answered that yesterday, stupid idea. Airport SHOULD be nuked.
---
Jesus, learn to read.... the first instance where I was crafting ammo was button mashing, sure, but everything else is the game fucking up and scrapping mods instead of using the ample materials I have on hand. When you build a CAMP item it only shows the amount of materials being used, not where they're coming from. Same with event repairs.
---
Well, that boils down to choices/consequences of what class you choose to roleplay as.  If I roleplay as a PA guy, then I am sacrificing stealth; I can't run or use VATS without draining fusion cores, and walking itself is slower. I can't use crafting stations without exiting the armor. If I drop in water, I can't quickly swim out but sink to the bottom and slowly walk around in the murky gloom while rads skyrocket.  If I choose to rp as a non-power armor character, then there are going to be drawbacks to that as well.
---
No it can't. He literally can't be harmed by anything. Except perhaps bethesda's coding. That kills us all inside at least a little bit.
---
*shuts curtains*
---
I was wondering about that as well. I've collected some great legendary armor and considering running around in it, instead of power armor, for a while. 
---
Power armor is a joke dude....
---
Yeah, the big difference is the prime uses only ultracite ammo. But the scorched killer uses regular ammo. But I since the scorchbeasts die too quickly, I've had to just spawn queens and see how the different weapons go. But yeah, once I get my silencers for my handmades I'll be able to try them out more effectively since I'm also running an Unyielding build, I die so easily. So keeping stealth is a priority and it's hard to do without a suppressor. 
---
Am I missing something? What in this scenario ever caused someone to think this was a duper? I am absolutely confused. (Being serious and not sarcastic)
---
Yeah still the spot, a friend got it last week, it just above the 65 state sign, same place, someone said it took an hour of server hoping ..
---
Ok, thanks. 
---
You are putting these restrictions on yourself! If you explored more, you wouldn‚Äôt have these issues. These are all self-inflicted wounds, yo.

I read this post as "I was participating in  PVP activity and I got my ass handed to me by another player(s). Instead of accepting my defeat, I tried to reason with my enemy and they shot me again! Those players had nothing better to do than play the game as intended. I'm going to resort to name calling on the internet now."
---
Gonna show us the video? 
---
Or just have a better build...
---
I don't believe so. I'm in the same boat with the Responders gear. Your best bet is probably to keep an eye on the shops to see if someone else sold theirs.
---
Yeah but there would that one guy shouting the n word on repeat
---
I was thinking less reptiles and more a set of robots that killed anything that behaved aggressively 
---
Combat. You can reach higher accuracy/range/rof. So higher dps either way.
---
This is not confirmed, but I have read that "trick or treaters" near Jack-O-Lanterns pumpkin house drop the plan.  The OP in the thread I read it in was stating that he had been hopping for days and only had one encounter with no results, so temper your expectations.
---
Make sure to go stash your junk first.
---
Which is why you take that perk and the scope and can almost snipe stuff.
---
It took me a long time and sometimes the witch didn‚Äôt have the plans. Just travel to the nearby dam and turn right and take a few steps forward. No body with dark clothes? Reload and repeat.
---
Question: gunslinger perks affect the 10 mm automatic pistol?
---
I've heard reports that high tamed level animals will downgrade in levels, can you confirm how long you've had it tamed? Like joining multiple servers over days? I had a level 21 Deathclaw, a level 20 Sloth, and now a level 30 Mirelurk king.
---
Ignore me, and have fun. I'm just really frustrated about weapons.
---
I have had TS, and E weapons with explosive perks, and none are worth a damn. I still need tons of ammo... yet I see people kill creatures I've been dumping lead into...in like 1-2 shots.
---
Turn on pacifist
---
I'm Xbox, but appreciate the offer. I do like the idea of a mentor. I'm Lvl 62 and want to start prepping for SBQ.
---
It is weight reduction. I have a couple of rifles with that perk on them. 90% weight reduction that is. The VATS perks are -25% cost, +33% hit chance, critical meter fills 15% faster, and critical shots do +50% damage. 
---
Dw, bud. Will run into you sooner or later.
---
Probably a poor choice of wording. Exploiting might be a better choice.
---
Just the whole situation, high bounty, attacking anyone, taking zero damage from high damage weapons and dropping me in two shots.
---
I'm getting decent feedback though, so he might have just been geared and perked really well. 
---
I wonder how long it would have taken if you had just farmed plans from vendors that carry it.  I've bought a few odd radium rifle plans when I had caps to spare on the chance I might want to play with that rifle sometime.
---
tbf, maybe he wasn't nakie? There's an instance bug were a player sees himself clothed but others see the player naked
---
I'm finding that out now. 
---
ouch
---
I just go ahead and blow that bitch to pieces when that happens
---
If he's not wearing PA and he's attacking you first he's no duper. Well he's not duping at that time, hes PVP'ing.
---
600 cap bounty and shoots first says it all really.
---
Duping needs to be fixed! 
---
As soon as someone dies there instant go to is DUPER....wtf since when did the wasteland breed snowflakes?
---
In my case I started with 1 and 2. But do realize that FO3 is over 10 years old. A lot of the people playing 76 were in preschool then, and a lot of the FO3 players now have kids in preschool lol.
---
It has usernames featured in it.  I'm not sure whether or not that would go against the witchhunting policies.
---
But if you PM me for it, I mean, it's not technically on the board...
---
Start a new character and get it then move it to your main is the only other option.
---
Of course . Thanxbro 
---
Not stacking. Starts with not having a ton of low level players driving the SBQs DR up. Team of 4 high level well built characters can easily destroy the queen. Get 4 high level well built characters with 8 low level crap builds and you‚Äôll lose every time. 
---
No reason to buff anything... anti armor explosive has always been better for the sbq. The meta just shifted to Anti armor explosive, or bloodied explosive.
---
The Wendingo Cave has at least one in it and there is one on the road in the north from Savage Divide to The Mire.  I'm not sure how I got it but there is a quest to kill a Wendingo while wearing a Clown Suit.   It will highlight where Wendingos are on the map as long as you don't wear the suit and finish the quest.
---
oh yea, definitely a duper, also see this guy could be a bank robber, now that I read your ppost again, I highly believe this guy could be a rapist of small barn animals.  You have got to report him IMMEDIATELY.
---
It doesn't matter what you do with them and its up to the player to decide how and what to use the mod for. The fact that it scraps valuable stuff first over using the actual available scrap material is the problem. No sympathy required, just common sense.
---
Lol it took them 1 1/2 months to fix duping this project would take them years 
---
 I believe it's the aftermath of a nuke usually. Even for sometime after the nuke zone has receded, flora and ghouls will be irradiated. This is true even for players who didn't witness nuke zone but joined server just after it ends.
---
 Hope this helps. 
---
Its bullshit...at that point I pass caps off and go to town
---
Lots of people seem to be using "duper" to define anyone playing in a way they don't understand. It is basically being used to replace "hacker". I am going to guess that they just don't know better.
---
*See a guy jumping really high and haven't heard of the marsupial mutation? DUPER!
---
*Someone you shoot doesn't take damage? DUPER!
---
It gets old really fast.
---
I often see a wendigo at the red rocket south of harper's ferry.  Not always, but a bunch.    (might be once you hit a certain level.)   There are other places where wendigos spawn pretty reliably.... like the wendigo cave.
---
I'm looking for metal wall plans? I'm on PS4 I'm interested in what you got I'll be on this afternoon noon. 
---
Heading to the DMV I hope is faster than the mission in the game haha
---
They are killing you with the explosive. Run the same build with anti armor and you‚Äôll destroy them. 
---
I helped kill a three-star Scorchbeast Queen last week and got nine fusion cells for my trouble. 
---
This game is not a collaboration - they're not looking to take a vote on what new features they add. Stop wasting time with these shitposts.
---
Proly did but being how I never talked online I proly just chucked it. 
---
You on PC? I will clear a bunker for you so you can launch it!
---
Maybe everyone should look at the setup one player used to kill the queen in under 2 minutes, solo. He posted it on here.
---
You don't need TSE weapons to kill her. There is something more viable, quicker and you don't need a legendary weapon. 
---
Now introducing root beer mentats, aka mentats brown...
---
What does porting do? Is it every time? Or just the first time? What is it intended to solve?
---
You might have gotten there after a nuke zone finished. it takes \~2 hours for spawns to fix sometimes.
---
I also wonder if it worth having a melee weapon that reflects melee dmg when blocking to stack with it.
---
I think you're saying it wrong.  In that case, it is tet-anus.
---
anti armor is the new meta for sbq
---
I read this comment as "I'm not actually going to understand what the person is saying, but instead boil it down to the lowest common denominator, so as not waste any effort in life. Person criticizes PvP, so they must be salty about getting owned, they couldn't possibly have any valid point that the system is fundamentally flawed and caters to people on a morality \*or the lack-there-of" based system, instead of being a skill based system as PvP should be".  
---
Jet's in Anchorage because of the game's random loot tables. They didn't make all containers use tables unique to the area, so it gets loot that really shouldn't be there. This is the same reason you find fresh produce in ancient ruins in Skyrim.
---
The reason for this is that most containers are pre-configured with the loot tables, and level designers just place them. This shouldn't really be seriously considered for lore implications.
---
It doesn't help higher level variants don't count towards progress. What made it tick over for you? I got credit from a Scorched Yao Guai at Prime. 
---
I've seen a [3* grahm](https://i.imgur.com/t1I3Qwc.png) myself. In a nuke zone at white spring. [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/fCdtCAl.png) another one when I first saw him, it kind of surprised me. I tried to kill him but the game wouldn't let me lol.
---
He had the fireproof perk and likely the dense mod on his armour.  Both protect from explosive damage.  I believe that the last patch made the fireproof perk more effective.  Then add other armour pieces with high energy defense...
---
So, the fact that you did little damage to him doesn't mean much, other than he probably has a good defensive build.
---
Tesla Is awesome with the quad effect and automatic mod. For some reason it doesn't break down nearly as fast as other energy weapons and it chains to multiple enemies. My only problem is going through ammo so fast. It's a beast with the right perk cards to build up damage.
---
Yes, but the last patch seems to have fixed it for me, as I haven't experienced it lately.
---
There was a post on here a week or two ago about Monongah being a new nuke-site meta when ghouls spawn there.
---
Just because you get smoked in PVP doesn't mean the other guy is duping. It just means you don't know how to play the game lol.
---
Pretty much what I do really - just ignore others and do what I can to help.  But I know I'm not a leecher and if I see leechers, I'll just shake my head and move on.  Doesn't mean I have to respect them one bit - cause they're just utter scum!
---
Interns gotta eat.
---
yup
---
Killed a 3\* lv 68 Supermutant at Harpers Ferry this weekend. 2 caps and like 5 .308 rounds. that was it. I sat at the loot screen kind of half chuckling, half crying to myself. 
---
The thing is i was not going to purchase this game as a lot of arguments that are waved about, and being a long time Fallout player bothered me. But bought on launch and am enjoying my time in its world. I think you miss a lot of the magic of this game when player interaction is avoided. The missing NPC's i understand from a design and narrative perspective to make player interaction more relevant. Too many people want this to be Fallout 5. Its not and never will be what they want. I can see where Beth came from, and while i don't agree with some choices they made. I can kinda guess the ideas for the grand plan. Its like when people complain about raiders or people trolling. The simple fact is this is not an AI based scripted event weighted in your favour like fallout 4. The guy or girl with the bigger gun has the advantage and if your not him or her, then you better up your skills and tactics so you can take them down. To me the player base is what makes this strong and without the strong rewards for PVP, it allows other ways to interact besides a bullet exchange every time. Fortunately we have the people playing as raiders and just plain arseholes bullies and that to me makes this more fun than everyone playing white hats. So i feel less guilty when my TSE Gauss round explodes their heads for trolling a low level player. Something that adding human NPC's will dilute with their wooden scripted AI.  
---
You give me the 535 caps i will server hop and find you the plan.
---
Lol idiot.
---
Its a thread of parroting morons and when someone actually tested it they were proven wrong.
---
But keep on parroting instead of understanding pvp
---
Cool. Thanks. I do have a MIRV and some pipe crap with the weight reduction.
---
No. Only single shot 10mm. Guerilla works for the auto pistols. If you're going a vats crit pistol build I'd recommend sticking with revolvers though. You want as much damage per crit as you can.
---
I‚Äôve experienced it both ways in over 60 queen kills even with 4 well built characters and no scrubs (don‚Äôt do it) nobody is killing the queen in 20-30s.
---
It could be done so that the first person to join gets the T.O.W.N.S. then every other user is added to that same server as well.
---
why did you write this like you were writing an advertisement? 
---
&gt; The more unique objects you have, the more that means the client/server communications has to maintain. 
---
Yeah but for camp furniture i believe that would only burden their systems after you put the furniture down inside of the world, or possible when they are in the stored section. Not when they just exist as options in the build menu before creation. Hence why the build budget exist, which i personally don't have an issue with yet.
---
&gt;  That‚Äôs why they probably went with what I‚Äôll call the core amount of objects 
---
I'm saying they don't seem to have limited themselves at all to any core amount of objects, but rather spammed us with tons of pointless camp furniture, which seems to indicate my former point is correct. But in theory i would gladly remove many many objects from the build menu in exchange for one radio.
---
Its not one you initially have.  You have to find the plans for them.  They have conduit and connectors that go through the walls.
---
Whats worse is, how have they not fixed this yet?
---
It'll be fine since the queen has been immune to explosives anyway so TSE had little effect on here
---
Sounds like he has a screw loose...  
---
Has anyone wondered if maybe they are disabling challenge rewards to get people to spend more money in the Atom Shop?
---
You sure that's Whitespring? Looks like Brokeback Mountain. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüñï

Pacifist stops that.
---
The handful of interns working on this game gotta get their 2-3 week of doing nothing breaks.
---
They always spawn there and they only bloom at night
---
haha, did i sell it to you?
---
Be careful drilling someone's was. They might drop a hefty bag of spoiled meat into your hands.
---
I heard some guy fumbling with his mic while I was in the mistress of mystery basement area, whatever that is.. he finally started yelling down to me: ‚Äúhello, is someone in there? cans you opens door for me?‚Äù
---
After trying to convince him there was nobody down there but us dead ghouls, and then asking him for the super secret password.. I let him in and explained he needed the veil. I thought it was funny. The only chance I‚Äôve had to mess with someone a little. 
---
Sounds good to me, but I haven't gotten it yet.  Definitely want to try it.
---
That's not a duper
---
Yeah you are correct. There is tons of stories loaded on holo tapes and technically one could Role play with others. However none of those stories engage the player and all the Role playing in Fallout 76 is severely hamstrung by the online platform. Nothing the player does has any real or lasting impact on the world. Kinda takes all the thunder out of role playing.
---
That's fine, but moving on isn't making comments about them on reddit, that's holding resentment for them and that makes you no better imo. In fact, it's worse.
---
I utterly despise disconnects,but would take a disconnect over a infinite loading screen any day.

Dnt tp directly to wanteds location. Tp close and be sneaky little bee......buzz buzz buzz üòÇüòÇ

What I don't get is, a modder could fix this literally in 10 minutes. Why can't BetH?

Wow, that is magnificent! Your decorating is absolutely spot on. This is why i want budget, so i can try and furnish to this quality!
---
I would make this into a separate post in itself, gives me another chance to upvote :D
---
I've noticed that sometimes when I kill a legendary enemy and it doesn't drop a legendary item. That a regular, non legendary enemy will drop a legendary. 
---
So make sure you check every corpse.

? Ill give you 600 but i wanna see the plans first
---
I'd rather someone use Jet while punching my butt over Fury.

Do you need to hold the perk in order for him to stay as a pet?

Holy shitüòÇüòÇ hit em with that "get gud bitch" lol
---
i have the advanced power connectors and i have the conduit pass through thing that looks like a big bow with a connected sticking out of the middle, i just couldnt figure out how to get it through the wall. i tried putting the wall first, the placing the pass through, then tries the pass through and then placing the wall. no dice. i eventually just gave up. real irritated we cant vertically rotate those conduits too. I ended up with some truly goofy looking conduit configurations bc of it. 
---
Exactly, a system like that would add such a great level to this game. When I saw that many players coming together and interacting I said we need to have this type of server interactions more in an isolated area. This way we can still keep the wasteland feel.
---
I get about 14 shots off with a full auto pistol at 15 agility and about 6 shots off on a full auto handmade at 6 agility.
---
I do not imagine a gatling gun gives you a choice in firing modes. It also seems the combat shotgun does not change at all with differing firing modes. I toyed around with a single shot handmade when I managed to get a bloodied explosive the dragon to drop, and noticed I was only getting 3-4 shots off in vats compared to the 6 when fully automatic.
---
Results seem to vary across weapon types.
---
Flair checks out too
---
Considering that the probability of missing a 66% shot 3x in a row is 3.5%, and it happens to me consistently, I'm 100% on the 'other issue' side of things 
---
It does it with my non explosive shotgun on my alt also. It may have something to do with the pellet spread issues that make explosive shotguns so powerful. It's so much more obvious with the explosive because any type of hit takes such a huge percentage of health. I've scene it miss 3 shots in VATS dozens of times so it's definitely an issue with the game and not just insanely bad RNG luck on my part.
---
Lol yeah I'm constantly fighting them too
---
You're over encumbered... with crap. 
---
i refuse to move my CAMP anymore. Tired of setting things up only to have someone take up residency in the area. So hopefully my area in the middle of no where doesn't get too popular....

None.

The only indication was there self congratulation at launch and saying a bunch of random stuff that has not been spoken about since.
---
Fun fact, they talked about the pvp mode a month later and now we're getting that in another month.
---
Slugger 1, Expert Slugger 1, Master Slugger 1, Incisor 3, Martial Artists and swing for the fences.
---
Surprisingly Agility is not as great as you would think.  Level 1 Adrenaline is nice, but you may want to put more into Intelligence to help out with your power armor.  Also a few points in Endurance will help with your chems. 
---
I think if it we're done right and presented well, people would be on board. This sub just gets elitist at times and downvotes ideas just because they don't like that people posted them in the first place, nothing to do with the idea itself.
---
Like I said, from a logical standpoint, it just doesn't make sense for the game to sit in this same period of time indefinitely. I think the great majority can at least agree on that.
---
Occasional good plan. PA plans in particular seem to come up frequently. wait until you are lv 50 at least. 
---
Morgantowns great for different fluxes though, whitesprings mainly has yellow cake which is good and all, but it's cool to have somewhere to reliably find other types
---
Was his name Fisto? Because it should be.
---
I don't listen to the radio the song selection was small and got old quick.

Best .44 I've seen yet. It's a keeper.

Bummer man, there goes 40% of your camp budget that is very hard to get back
---
Lol ye, makes the queen fight intersting dont it 
---
I see. I understand the issue, I was noting it as a work around.
---
I'm doing no PA so you can see my baseball uniform.
---
They need way to implement a way players can broadcast.  That would be dope.  
---
Its aggrivating for sure.  I built a 2 x 2 box and experimented with it for a while.  It was easier than trying to figure it out with my camp built first.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76: Do it all over again, edition.

On a different but related note, I am one my 4th attempt at killing a wendigo in a clown costume.  I've completed it 3 times and it keeps coming back.  First I have to get another clown hat because I gave mine to my kiddo.   I'm getting tired of running around in a clown costume.  I think I may just burn that thing and turn the quest marker off.
---
But thanks for the insight!
---
I must have very bad luck. Iv tried countless times over the past two days I haven‚Äôt even seen her once  
---
I think you're liar and are not aware of the all the factors when you"tested" it.
---
Yea ok 
---
Errr, that same youtuber in a different video explains that he and his friends were wrong. That ash pile is his friend who was in trade with Grahm to keep him in place. 
---
Thus, why I did not report them or start a witch hunt with their usernames. Being on PS4 I'm less likely to believe they have the numbers to have this much gear. Looking at the other post I'd say certain gear is a big red flag.
---
Always nice to argue both sides of the coin to get a dialog going. Cheers.
---
There are npcs in the game lol just because they arent human doesnt somehow disqualify them from being non playable characters üòÇüòÇ so no we dont need them. They already here 
---
That's just because its the game as it was intended.
---
They added slap damage to appease people just before launch, its so badly implemented and doesnt work at all really does it :(
---
Bethesda are a joke.
---
Sean Murray &gt; Bethesda LMAO
---
I used to listen to it but as you said it's fairly repetitive. I love the radios on FO4 and NV though. 
---
 Also feel with 76, when you get further into the endgame, sounds become increasingly more important. Those subtle grunts of alertness can be the difference between being bitch slapped and getting rad worms or pwning a ghoul. 
---
I shall make amends
---
Just out of interest why don't you trust people wanting to trade? Often I invite players too but it's just so I can see what cool stuff they have or if I can buy any ammo off them. I think spending caps is a good way to keep the economy alive between players
---
Imagine that slow walk except 100% of the time in the non-combat areas rather than just through the decon gate.
---
Best time to be in whitesprings all the glowing ones none of the radiation and there usually isn't a lot of people there
---
Another thread about this, so we need it?
---
No.
---
That is actually a major plot point of Fallout 2. The Bishop crime family uses how addictive it is to enslave entire towns and undermine NCR's power.
---
you need to be out in the open. If there is a lot of trees or terrain in the way it cant land. if it's attacking you run to an open spot and just stand still. if you move around a lot it can rest it's landing sequence and will just fly around for a while. 
---
Just curious how what is your luck?
---
Why is it taking you so long? 
---
Vats and two shot is terrible.
---
Ive shot at sqb with vats and saw my shots go around sqb alot.
---
That accuracy drop overrides 95% chance to hit
---
If pve and pvp players are on the same map, wouldn‚Äôt it be possible pvp nuking random spots nuke pve players‚Äô camps? What‚Äôs stopping pvp players be friends with pve players and see what pve players see?
---
Also this! Easily enough to be implemented. Camps have radio tower, players can stream out adverts for shop or ask for assistance etc. While players who are wandering get the same message as we do now.so.ething like, Player KMooreLods radio found/lost. 
---
You're going to hate me, but I think that is am-ends.
---
Yeah I can see how one missed word changes everything lol.  Adding Barbarian will help, but you wont be able to take the QoL carry weight perks at max. 
---
You may want to look into a bloodied, adrenal reaction build (low hp, high damage)
---
I wonder what the stuff you described has to do with duping??? He probably ran a full sentinel assassins armor with additional skill cards and was just better equipped than you. Seriously, don‚Äôt just jump on conclusions...
---
I usually use the camp emote from the atom store then a love heart 
---
Not all of us have seen it. I'm new to the game. 
---
It don't even make sense
---
I agree! Along with the "soothing voice" line of the harpers ferry vendor, it is one of the best lines imo. 
---
I didn‚Äôt think of that. That would be awesome! Like build a radio tower in your settlement that‚Äôll broadcast to local players and use your mic to communicate. Use it to form groups or give newer players tips. 
---
The apocalypse can be hard on a boy.
---
Sorry for your loss, always PLACE, not DROP unless you are giving the suit to another player ( dropping it removes the claimed tag)
---
Watoga has 3x PA spawns easily accessible, just look for the vertibots (2 on roof, 1 on ground) there is also one behind a lvl3 locked door in watoga. And 2 more spawns at the military Camp SE of Watoga Train station and at the bunker north of fissure prime, supposedly there is one @ the junk yard east of watoga too.
---
A PSA for those that dont know too, if you take all the armor/cores off a frame but leave the frame, new PA parts/cores will NOT spawn until the frame is removed. So please if you empty a frame, please remove it so the next guy doesnt just get just an empty frame, Thanks!
---
Nope.  I can haz fast travelz.
---
Did your sister's boyfriend's cousin's nephew's friend's uncle give you the scoop?
---
i just rebuilt my camp yesterday and decided to give it a shot. i got some of it to somewhat work, just not that pass through. maybe one day i'll try again, lol
---
Got a source? 
---
Have you used one of those before?
---
Those pistols take longer to reload than shoot all the bullets. 
---
 What we really need is a way to mark items not to be scrapped.
---
I suggest switching to the plasma flamer. Mine has oddly enough not decreased that in condition yet.
---
Makes sense. I‚Äôm bummed I‚Äôm getting bored with it. I agree about the importance of subtle sounds for sure. I‚Äôd never switch the thing on if I wasn‚Äôt in a low level area haha. 
---
Just fight the level 68's they give good exp
---
So, did you have to have level 3 perk card of animal friend in charisma for this? Because I just have the first level, and sometimes pacifying it works, but I‚Äôve never seen a ‚Äútame‚Äù option. I really want a pet 
---
Got called a duper because I could run real fast. Just have a decent agility, a few Unyielding Armours and an agility weapon. Also speed demon serum.
---
 Obviously, I didn't entertain it. Just ran away lol. 
---
Go inside the whitesprings resort my dude, there's a vendor in there with most basic plans
---
I was worried this might be the case, and I‚Äôll definitely check the vendors for one when I roll through the stations. I also saw someone placing a ‚Äúwant ad‚Äù on the F76 Bazaar subreddit for a Fire Breathers‚Äô Uniform, so I may do the same when I‚Äôm next online.
---
Thank you, Ive been thinking about posting it in the 76settlements sub, tho Im still doing changes and never feel like ready to go lol.
---
Quit whining.
---
Where are they please? 
---
Will try, thanks!
---
There was a part the other day that had a link to a Google doc that listed where everything is. I believe the part was asking about a couch with a throw blanket on it 
---
That was always one of my first mods I used when playing FO4. 
---
Source!?? 
---
That‚Äôs good advice, thank you!
---
Agreed but some people like the trade aspect of the game. It's another facet that you can get into and that's a fine thing, the more things you can do the better. Silly bugs like this get in the way, and it does nothing but detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. Yes there are workarounds but generally people on this thread are flaming op for not being careful, when it's a two way street and Beth is equally at fault for allowing this bug to go on unfixed for this long.
---
Like I have previously stated. I am new to reddit and fallout.. 
---
Wow, so if my Gatling gun weighed 20 instead of 2 pounds (bear arms) I'd only get one shot instead of five?
---
Ouch lol
---
\&gt; Let‚Äôs make it work   
---
Don't say "let's" like you're part of the dev team
---
Lol ok.
---
Wait until they implement the mode before saying that.
---
Reddit says alot of stuff that isn't true and isn't listened to, like forcing new characters and killing the mode before it even launches
---
GARY!
---
I‚Äôve suggested heavy weapons buff but one that focuses more on utility than outright damage. Examples being, give Heavies a 200% boost to durability. Have more options to craft special ammo types for heavy weapons using pre-existing ammo as well.
---
(ie. 100 5MM + 20 Plasma Ammo/1 Plasma Core = 100 Plasma infused 5MM with +50% plasma damage)
---
Gary?
---
You might actually need to use those weapon recipes to make a weapon that isn't going to be immediately scrapped.
---
Throw in some twisted muscles for good measure
---
I'm in the same boat.  i have so many plans and other junk i been holding on to so i can sell em at my vendor bot. 
---
I like Excavator for the carry capacity and used it until I got a pair of calibrated shocks.  I was able to do this for T60 before any other set and T60 is cheap to repair.  I actually have one of every set, so I would love to get calibrated shocks on X01 or Ultracite to get some extra defense.
---
I would start wearing T51b as well because I've got Nuka paint on it.
---
That's the beauty of video games. They let you express your true self.
---
Even with the PvP risks, workshops are your best bet.
---
I usually claim the workshop, then wait for the first defense event to spawn. You usually get two CAMP plans in ten minutes. Then run to the next and repeat. 
---
I've yet to have anyone kill me, and I usually help anyone who wants the workshop take it, especily low levels.
---
No problem
---
That's why the massively increased damage resistance during reloading makes this an amazing drop. 
---
Wow, way to be offended. It would be toggled so you don't have to to turn it on if you didn't want to, sorry you're afraid of griefers.
---
Every character i  the game who is not co trolled by a player is an NPC....a Non Playable Character.......Why are people struggling to grasp this?
---
Dupers are the scapegoat for ignorance. 
---
Dupers 1 shot ppl in pacifist mode when you own a workshop or are in a party with ppl not running pacifist mode
---
The jet will make ya jittery
---
What are all the mods?
---
Awesome, thanks for the insight. Sounds like a lot of it is going to come down to wasting resources testing for myself no matter what though, might as well get to it.
---
I think you're confusing us with another group. 
---
I read this thread in Richard Simmons voice...
---
The water filter recipe is useless as anything more than a novelty.  
---
You can be swimming in purified water in no time.  
---
Take one of the workshops, like the junkyard, and do the defense quest.  You should earn the small water purifier recipe which can be set anywhere, no water required.  
---
Need more power for those purifiers?  Do the 'Powering up..." quests for the power plants, like Poseidon.  
---
By the time you've scrounged up enough resources to get you by with the 'water filter' recipe, you can be selling spring fresh canned water to vendors for extra caps.
---
Warn before last ban wave 
---
https://ibb.co/0QdXkDp
---
I love that. The only role playing I got to do was pretending to be a priest. Love the creativity. 
---
Just an fyi, whenever I find anyone with a camp behind the golf club I raze it to the ground. I would recommend moving it a suitable distance away to allow players to farm without interference. 
---
Since I have already report it before, I leave this here so we can have more people report it directly rather that continue to complain about it.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10?prod=1129&amp;cat=287
---
Warned before last Ban wave
---
Fair enough, for your information there are threads that were written before you joined Reddit in the 3 months since the game has been out that you can read even if you just joined.
---
A good rule of thumb is to use the search and type in something about the topic you wish to discuss before posting a new thread. Chances are good someone has already discussed the topic. In a lot of cases this will get you immediate answers when you have questions.
---
I warned before last ban wave also
---
They updated inside the vault shortly after posting it saying it was a misunderstanding.....
---
I get my ass handed to me every time I look at whitesprings lol. I'm only LV 24
---
it wont even let me place doors in my brick walls, just says they are floating
---
Thanks for the tip
---
&gt; Allow players to "port" their existing PvE characters into the Survival servers. If they choose this, they get to keep their levels, get to reallocate their SPECIAL points and pick new perk cards. BUT they completely lose all of their weapons from armor (both from stash and inventory). You get to keep your junk and recipes so you can craft basic things to get started again. 
---
While this is an acceptable compromise in terms of gameplay balance, it still fragments the playerbase. The trade communities already have to split three platforms and further splitting to Adventure/Survival is going to make it even harder to coordinate trades. Never mind the inability to play with friends or form ad-hoc groups with people split across game mods.
---
Did a friend of yours place a item you dont have?
---
Everything you wrote is exactly what I want, and in that order.  Especially #1.  Common, that regular hazmat suit has room to swim around in it!  I could probably put that hazmat suit on over power armor, it's so big and bulky.   
---
No problem, sorry to bring bad news that it's only 25% less vats cost. 90 would be insane!
---
Yeah 
---
See my next comment down. Also I never said anything about recipes, so I'm not 100% sure why you're responding to me here.
---
Sure they would. Why risk death or waste time fighting while farming on a pvp server when you can do it completely safely and efficiently on a pve server? I don‚Äôt care how geared and skilled you are, the threat of pvp will slow you down while farming. 
---
The point of toggled option. 
---
Thats probably why
---
PS4? May very well have been me!!!
---
It has been this way since BETA, nothing to do with dupers.
---
For sure, that is a must have.  
---
i guess bud , i took it as "it's sick" but thats just me
---
I meant it in a way for players to broadcast music, but these other options sound just as good.  
---
Up votes all the way up the chain!   ;)   You weathered my pun-ishment well, in the end.
---
TL;DR :
---
"I did not have all the info about PVP, and immediately assumed another player was using hackz"
---
Your source is your own comment where you say it's a rumor? 
---
But even Sean Murray didn't release the same game and call it a DLC or new content haha.
---
The new mode is already going to be BETA, for them to come out and say this before they give us any actual info on it suggests its not anywhere near ready no?
---
Will duping be fixed before its launched or is the new game mode going to be flooded with crappy TSE's forcing everyone to use one or two builds just to stay alive.
---
I guess we wait until mid / end of March just for more disappointment :(
---
Yeah something like that needs to happen.  Even the flies over meat piles are somewhat hard to find in dense grasses.
---
I never knew if anyone made a mod for that in FO4. Do you know the name of it? I don‚Äôt play much with mods but that‚Äôll be for sure something to try out. 
---
They patched the dupe glitch, I doubt they were duping, they were probably giving legendaries to each other or giving free legendaries to people who find the bag
---
That was tet-offensive
---
Nice find...where about?
---
I‚Äôve been checking Appalachian Antiques regularly hoping for something like that or the BOS combat helm, so far I‚Äôm just restocking my fatigues and snagged the BOS hood
---
Np! Free travel location after you claim it too. The events keep spawning, so for 20-40 caps each you can get 2+ plans for every workshop.
---
Oh damn!  Fortunatley for us,  you aren't Bethesda!  Imagine getting banned for listening to music in your own home.  Bethesda can fuck right off of that was the case! 
---
You just used yourself for a source!?!? That would hold up in court /s
---
i did this saturday and was losing my shit no quest markers for the few remaining cooling tower repairs. i couldnt find the generator to repair and the quest marker would take me outside, then right back inside. Completed the partial repairs though. 
---
I joined in on a group doing it sunday and between all of us we got it completely repaired. 
---
This is getting ri-dic-ulous
---
How does one ‚Äúknow‚Äù they‚Äôre dupers? Wish that Bethesda would make someone glow yellow or something when you do that speed-crafting thing more than 100 items in within a 5 minute timeframe.  Until then, I‚Äôm not going to go after people based on a hunch...
---
If you‚Äôre in one of the two places nukes get dropped, sure. Would like to see more incentive to nuke other places on the map. I don‚Äôt even bother checking the map when a nukes going to drop because 90% of the map is guaranteed safe. 
---
If that were the case, why did they immediately start shooting at me when I emptied the bag? Obviously they were duping.
---
If you look at the date and day I posted that. The ban wave started right after. I was showing my track record.
---
This exact example is a post I just saw here 2 minutes ago. 
---
Got 1 shotted by a bullshit hacker.....
---
"Oh, there's PVP rules regarding workshops? I didn't bother to do any reasearch"
---
So from the sound of all of this together, the only real options for a dedicated VATS Medic build would be auto rifle/shotguns?
---
My Tesla charging shotgun gets like 5-6 shots I wonder how many more it would be if I made it auto...
---
SO THATS WHERE MY MODS GO!?!
---
especially when things turn to meat pile so quickly
---
Maybe they were giving legendaries to each other 
---
So yes it would hold up in court. 
---
As I was questing for Rose last night, who is one of the more interesting NPCs in 76, I came to a strange realization. The NPCs in 76 are all "Press E to listen to me, then go fetch/kill this".
---
Remember FO3 where you had dialogue options, effected by your Perks and Special? I'd love for some more interaction to return, instead of just listening like the silent protagonist.
---
3 words
---
LET IT GO
---
 BTW: The information below can be found all over this sub, along with many things i will miss.
---
In the Pre-level 50 stages, weight, camp, and stash restrictions are a bitch.
---
My advice is not to worry about looting everything in site at this point. and keep an eye on your inventory for things you are not using.
---
I'm bad about hording, but i learned to let it go. 
---
Check AMMO, drop any missles, 40mm grenades, nukes, or anything you will not use. 
---
Check notes for unlearned recipes and plans, MISC for bullshit like burned books, etc., Chems for things you will not use, spoiled items, and chems you should be ***using because you will*** *come across tons.*
---
Armor,  Just keep what you wear, unless you come across a good legendary for later, also learn deep pocketed asap.
---
Weapons, keep a primary and backup of Ranged or Melee depending on how you play, and then 1 of the opposite. Scrap everything else you pickup as you will learn mods each time (until you learn them all) Don't horde frags of any kind, use them, they are everywhere, and they weigh .5 a piece. 
---
Mark the more rare junk that you use frequently (Pip Boy/ Junk /R1 on PS4 to view components) and then you pick up only what you need. Scrap often, and get "Pack Rat" as soon as it's available for times when you do horde and get overcucumbered.  
---
Thru Hiker, Traveling Pharmacy, and Pack Rat changed my life.
---
Also if you have the recipe cook ragstag and you'll have a +20 carry wt when you need it, there's other food with a carry wt bonus well. Combine this with strength chems/foods, perks, and Excavator Armor (get this asap) to get to fast travel capability.
---
I'm telling you this as someone who was in your position, I kept every weapon I thought i might use when i got to that level, and different armor that i thought i would need, and finally learned to LET IT GO.
---
And once you find all vendor factions you will be getting plenty of caps, promise.
---
 I hope this helps you out:-)
---
Is that what were doing now? Calling everyone dupers?  When I farm WS with my friends and Randos that pick up on it, we all put our excess legs into the red bin on the bottom floor.  Does that make us dupers now?
---
If your name was Ed:
---
‚óè&lt;----- disap-point-ed
---
SBQ is going to be even more cancer than now. Everyone is going to be running the same 2 builds, melee or rifle crit/sneak.
---
Good job Bethesda.
---
Sorry, been a bit hectic, I'll send a list when I get 5 minutes! 
---
Anyone that defends the way Bethesda have handled themselves since launching this mess isn't a true fallout fan. How can they be if they encourage Bethesda to tank the franchise?
---
White knighting for companies that use under handed marketing and minimal Customer service is questionable no?
---
For me it goes;
---
Pictures, then black screen with loading icon like the world is going to load, and it appears frozen..... Then back to pictures and game loads.
---
Can't broadcast music for legal/copyright reasons. Unless Bethesda got the right like GTA style which doesn't seem likely. Would be great though and obviously if it was implemented, radios would be everywhere. 
---
Yeah but I'm asking for a source to back up your current claims, not evidence that you were right in the past. 
---
Bummer, I've been playing since release and haven't had a single griefer destroy my C.A.M.P altho I've had many visitors. The point would be it's toggled so you don't have to reveal your location if you didn't want to.
---
Who knew that intentionally going to a location with a high level wanted player could possibly end in disappointment.  Of course all wanted players just want to be fast travel points for your adventures and they'll give you stuff just for dropping by and saying hi...
---
Hence why I suggest it for ***Survival***, and not adventure mode.
---
Assuming my employment status is impolite and uncalled for.
---
Well then why would you shoot at someone emptying out the container? If it‚Äôs literally their trash why care if people take it?
---
Yes. But if you read my post AGAIN. You will see that I said ones that didn't want to kill you all the time. 
---
It's like that for everyone, also for me when it works, that's not the issue. It's when it freezes and crashes is the issue I'm talking about.
---
thats how I sell it
---
Okay. I think they'll be able to live with not being called a "true fan" in this case. 
---
Poor armchair detective work on your part.
---
Thanks for the heads up! 
---
They say they did, but it will never be properly patched.   They found a way in minutes after ‚Äúpatch‚Äù and im sure they will find a way after the next one.   
---
Don't be a butt-head:  No dick jokes in the butt pun thread!   What do you think this is?  Dickbutt?
---
I've started doing nukes and hitting some unconventional spots, it can be pretty fun if not useful.  
---
Charleston Capital Building gives a ton of high level scorched and glowing ghouls but didn't see any legendary.  
---
Vault 96 area had like 4 scorched but an absolute ton of flux.
---
Some events will give you the same plans until you have read them, 
---
Can someone explain what is actually happening? Are you saying the game is breaking down mods when trying to repair something that requires steel?
---
I can not just put my source out there and risk their job. NDA‚Äôs and Ethics. Yet I have shown Evidence proving that I had info before and shared it...and that has come true. That shows a track record and a Pattern.
---
Yeah I jump on and off, I'm just crafting in my base or doing trades etc I put it on. I like FO4 with the radio host, he had so much personality for someone with so little personality, felt like you had an actual companion. The way real radio does. 
---
Upvoted because I would love this. 
---
There's a substation just north of Watoga where one always spawns. Ranges between 80 and 95 when I had my base there. 
---
Amazing picture. Scarred for life.
---
XD dick in the butt.
---
Edit* SHIT, NO SORRY. I meant to say dip in the bud
---
Yep.  One of many stupid things that have been happening for far too long...  like since Beta.
---
OK, sure buddy. 
---
Toggle is a solution for people who don't want to take the risk, true, but I think the people who are willing to risk it will be very dissatisfied with the result. Hoping to see a solution for these brave men and women.
---
I have no idea if you were being a douche or if they were just fucking around, but my first inclination is not to immediately jump to "they must be duping."
---
Bethesda, messed up the Canvas bad.
---
Bethesda didn't learn and messed up the Nuka Cola Rum.
---
Bethesda agree's and endorses another sub par product but lets all hate Capcom?
---
Who gives a fuck about Capcom, can they fix FO76? 
---
Bethesda trying to tank stock prices or something, I don't understand how 1 company can keep going from one bad decision to the next.
---
Yea but that goes for most Outfit items, at this point until DLC I‚Äôm just looking for obscure stuff for the fun of it, was delighted to read a post recently about the nukacola vendor at WS, which somehow I‚Äôd completely missed.
---
The leopard bandana is a good example of something that was out there but I just hadn‚Äôt come across...
---
Another good obscure item was the dog helm I found at the freakshow....totally worthless but still fun
---
Much like FO4, I initially thought the CAMP stuff was lame. I just wanted to wander around shooting shit. But I eventually caved a little, enough to build a little 2x1 with a sleeping bag, my stash, and a few crafting workbenches. Then, once I got a little bored, and I was constantly running short of purified water (somehow), I found a nice place in the woods NW of Alpha site, on the edge of a pond, with a nice little babbling brook forming a mini-waterfall. I built a smallish 2x6 wood shack, complete with a little bedroom and two industrial water purifiers.
---
Fast forward to two or three weeks later, and I've since upgraded it to a two story job, and I just finished replacing all the exterior wood with brick. It's also powered by two fusion generators now, for all my lamps and such. It's cozy. And I leave it unlocked and available for any to use. It's not near any spawn points, either, so I don't even have turrets up, because I've never needed them taking up that budget space :)
---
Yesterday, I came back to my camp to see a guy in a Faschnacht mask "using" my port-a-potty, making the "diseased" emoji as he left it, and then waved and went on his way.
---
"Alexa, set volume to 76."
---
I mean, it's not like exploit patches and bans are exactly hard to predict.
---
New Patch, new fixes, ban wave.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
&gt; instigating melee weapons
---
instigating only works at full health, do you mean furious which is increased damage over repeated hits?
---
Okay....you believe that. 
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
Yeah. People ask for story-driven content, but they also want to be able to play for a thousand hours. Something‚Äôs got to give. 
---
I think adding it as a perception perk would be a good idea; would allow players to choose if they want it or not.
---
I made my own FO76 playlist on spotify, with a lot of the great music from 4 and New Vegas, and play that in the background on my XB. Still gives that great ambient music from the previous games with a better selection than stock.
---
Still miss the DJs though.
---
You want to share loot with more than one person. If some hog took all the free goodies I wanted to give away I‚Äôd be a little peeved too.
---
Lol, and why have they done that? Because the high end mobs there, such as lvl 80 scortchbeasts, don't drop anything worth figthing for. That is the reason the design is crap, "endgame" is everyone cluster fucking in one area to figh lvl 68 mobs  that, for some reason, drop the best gear, and even then 99 out of 100 drops are worthless. That is not competent or compelling game design.
---
That's pretty awesome, would be cool if you could pull up the stairs or something like a draw bridge ..
---
Well, they are a bit difficult particular when there's high amount of enemies, but you just got to get used to rushing their bodies specially legendaries. 
---
On some areas as the bodies turn into meat piles with flies, those flies are semi-helpful in finding bodies, and most of them go away completely when you loot them.
---
Also, the game can any given time deside to kick you out, or crash. Your suggestion doesn't combat that.
---
Excellent integration into the bridge and overall a very nice build :)
---
Well, welcome to West Virginia
---
Oh cmon don‚Äôt be naive: clearly they were trying to use the Rollback glitch to dupe the legendaries they were getting
---
It goes to show track record and pattern. Which can be used in court to verify motive and such.
---
Just because I‚Äôm not naming or revealing source doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt one.
---
"we built this immersive setting and you're going to look at it whether you like it or not!"
---
Sorry, didn't know if they were separate issues or variations of the same issue
---
Its not fixed
---
Track record is not a source! If that comment had a source on it then yes, it would help support your claim but now it's just you stating things.
---
 I could say it s gonna snow tomorrow and show a post from the last time I said it, where it snowed right after. Would you believe me? 
---
I just learned this myself.  I mean, i knew u were flagged for PVP in workshop just didnt know it stayed with u if u left.   
---
I too have been 1 shotted in pacifist mode a while back.  I just cant remember if i had a workshop at the time owned.  
---
Hmm... maybe someone should make a mod that removes floating nametags and places nametags on the players armor or chest (as a tattoo)  lol.
---
You dont need to be in a group to tag a perk for sharing, its Triangle on ps4 when your looking on your perk cards. Not sure on the other flavors.
---
Because Bethesda burned a lot of fans with FO76, and now those fans are going to be critical of everything they do. 
---
Every company does dumb stuff or releases some overpriced items for their rich fans, Bethesda just doesn't seem to understand there might be better times to push these items.
---
The whole "seeing dupers in the bushes" thing is getting dumb, I offered up some free 1-2* legendaries and dude says he won't take them because their duped... No one is duping a 1 star dude...
---
Yep it is, look it up
---
We've seen this brought up a few times and I love it! It would be super rad to have this and would encourage more team work with building. 
---
Was it a bunch of 1-2 star junk legendaries? Most players dump their junk legendaries into a nearby container (or on the ground) to reduce weight to enable fast travel. And to allow anyone else to pick them up -- who knows, one person's junk could be an upgrade for another. Their value to weight ratio is terrible so it's not worth hauling to a vendor to sell.
---
I have sources... who work for Bethesda. I‚Äôm just not naming or putting them.
---
I had a guy stand next to me naked and made me uncomfortable, now I am thinking maybe he wasn't naked ..
---
Not really. That new survival mode is survival againts other players.
---
So nothing new will be added to PvE players.
---
So just a quick update, something is definitely strange with the disease duration times...had two  in savage divide at just under 2 hours each...traveled to the bog and they went up to just under 3 hrs, traveled to the forest to forage and they both expired 15 mins later.
---
Motive!? Haha without a source, your track record means nothing. 
---
Which costume plans?
---
Yeah, mods can be scrapped for resources like steel, aluminium, black titanium in the case of excavator mods. When you do something that requires one of these materials the game will sometimes use your mods as the source even if you have scrap of that particular material available. If you're crafting at a bench it shows you where the material is coming from so you get a chance to catch it, but there are lots of things where you don't get that warning so it just scraps your stuff and uses that. 
---
This is why I now immediately attach mods I want to keep. Annoying for sure! RIP X-01 Cal shocks and T-60 Cal Shcoks!
---
To be faaaaaaaaaaaaair
---
The funny thing is that I was level 96 and 100+ hours in when I saw my very first Behemoth.. recently, I've been seeing them every other day in different locations. 
---
in the deepest regions on the wasteland too 
---
Part of me wants to drop it.  The other voice in my head wants to keep it going and see if anyone actually reads all the way to "the end".
---
Retracing steps in the overworld always has the potential for emergent experiences, but backtracking all the way through an interior is tedious and bland and most importantly: ***not fun.***
---
I strongly disagree that none of the interiors warrant fast travel. The Wendigo Cave certainly comes to mind.
---
That said, if they had designed the bigger dungeons like many in Skyrim so that the end has a passage that drops right back near the entrance, then I could get behind disabling fast travel from interiors (or, give it some sort of lengthy cooldown and/or make it really expensive).
---
So your source is Bethesda, yet you cannot name them.  Seems legit /s
---
Rebuilding a base destroyed by another player cost no extra mats, so the only thing you achieve doing this is loosing your caps from the bounty :)
---
Plus my base does not aggro nearby gouls, Gary just helps defend it if someone aggro them and pull them in my base :)
---
Try it out and let us know. Someone else replied to me saying their combat shotgun did not benefit in vats from making it fully automatic, so I don't know what to think.
---
Yep üòû
---
Definitely see this brought up a lot, and we've told the Dev's that this is a feature players want.
---
I have just started doing the same thing. What is the damage on the hardened receiver?
---
You can also find some mods available at the Harpers Ferry vendor. Like the night vision scope
---
The high school has a chemistry station on the second floor, too, in the chemistry room. I honestly don't craft that much in Watoga though, because of how hostile the robots tend to be. (Even though I finished Mayor for a Day, it still freaks me out to be wandering around and hearing them ready to attack.) 
---
I like it, especially after [unlocking a trailer full of motorcycles](/spoiler) .
---
I know this a stretch (and just more of a fun thought than anything), but what if we took your motorcycle idea and hop up some Power Armor to transform into a motorcycle similar to the Cyclones from Robotech?  Again, imagination fuel.
---
Yeah next patch should be this week to fix this no? 
---
That's a sinking feeling...
---
I was wondering what happened to my jetpack ;-; I‚Äôm putting my mods in my box then 
---
I only normally listen to it in Fallout Games when not adventuring as I prefer the world music. 
---
FO76 I wasn't a fan of the selection of songs, it didn't feel as well curated as previous titles. Beach Boys triggers me every time. 
---
And employee. But look if you don‚Äôt believe fine. No sweat or skin off my back. Just don‚Äôt comment downvote move on.
---
They spawn in the are west / northwest of Dyer Chemical during the event Heart of the Swamp. I've found them there 100% of the time while that event is up.
---
Or just fix rad resistance....  Did you know that the damaged Hazmat suit at 500 rad resist has the same protection as the Hazmat suit at 1000?  Maybe not exactly, but in a blast zone, both reduce rads to &lt;1/sec.  The undamaged one might reduce it to .15 rads/sec and the damaged might reduce it to .30 rads/sec.  However, if you just have 500 rad resist via chems, you still get fried in a blast zone...  Proof [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a90myd/proof\_that\_hazmat\_suit\_and\_power\_armor\_has\_hidden/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a90myd/proof_that_hazmat_suit_and_power_armor_has_hidden/)  Thanks to Sandbox\_Hero.
---
It still baffles me how people can defend something that's so broken and then go on to attack and downvote people that point out flaws. 
---
How dare you OP point out flaws in this supposedly perfect game? 
---
Can someone please tell me what TSE stands for.
---
I was lvl 166 with 12 charisma and lvl 3 animal friend yes.
---
You are correct.
---
Does luck actually affect this?
---
I love how far this community is willing to use the duper witch Hunt to exact revenge on anyone they had an experience with and didn't like the outcome. 
---
A guy 1 shotted me..... Duper!
---
I tried to melee a guy and he jumped 10 feet high.....Duper!
---
There was a workshop dispute.... I have pacifist on...he killed me....Duper!
---
Game crashed .... Duper!
---
Fucking people.
---
Id love to be able to take cool wep's and store them to rotate through their use. But unfortunately, its impossible to save/store anything like this in any way. I've had to drop just about every single wep I have ever wanted to store. Probably one reason I haven't played the game in a while.
---
‚ÄúNothing should be instanced...‚Äù. Evan disagrees ;)
---
Why not have the bot inside the vault? Maybe they can make it a quest to speak to him before you are allowed to leave 
---
You're the only one this has ever happened to, but thanks for letting us know about this as-yet unreported bug.
---
Yeah overall  my biggest complaint is invisible/naked teammates. 
---
If you think that there has been no duping since the last patch you are mistaken.
---
Were they open already? Or are they ever closed, like prime fissure can be. I haven't checked them much to know for sure.
---
I mean if they are closed, I would imagine they would open and SB and her entourage would pop out.
---
I have to assume that there is no video of this right? 
---
Ztoned66 is saying that when you have more than 5 of the industrial WP, they do not max out at 5 anymore.
---
I'm guessing each one has 2-3 each time he checks, no matter how much time has gone by.
---
I bet there's a limit set for CAMPs, limiting water intake per area so players don't horde the shit out of PW.   Maybe for server stability reasons, and that's just a guess.
---
The thunder mountain sub station. That spawn isn‚Äôt random tho so sadly it‚Äôs untameable. I‚Äôve tried many many times lol. 
---
Ugh - to me, this is one reason why legendary weapons are preferred even with lame stats, just so I won't accidentally scrap them. Now just wait until you accidentally scrap your power armor frame, or dump into a quest hopper, or sell to a vendor because of lag...
---
It's not 40% for sure, more around 10%. 
---
And Gary is worth it :D
---
Enter in the gate across from the train station, basically go straight and take a left into the resort, you shouldn't be attacked at all, leave the same way. As long as no enemies in the area, it's not an issue. I have a video if you need. In and out and no one the wiser. also normally loads of bots in the area, so if something chases you they will engage.
---
Inventory management is playing the game. If you want to play a pure shooter game, there are tons of those available.
---
I never said there wasnt any duping dipshit, I said the LAST duping glitch was patched 
---
Just saying, I wouldn't hold your breath on this feature. Not to mention how rife it is for abuse
---
No I removed it and he stays in base even if i reconnect to another server.
---
didnt get past the title, terrible analogy... just terrible.
---
I‚Äôd love to have a power connection on the interior side, so I could open it from inside my house...
---
I don‚Äôt understand the fuss about this jacket. While I (and apparently many others) may think it‚Äôs ugly as sin, based on the images it appears to be well made. If it‚Äôs the material they claim‚Äîand there‚Äôs no evidence to indicate that it isn‚Äôt‚Äîthen a $276 price point is far from outrageous. 
---
While it may not be appealing to most people it‚Äôs just one of many pieces of limited edition merchandise. Buy it if you like it, don‚Äôt buy it if you don‚Äôt. Life is a lot more enjoyable when you stop looking for things to get pissed off about. 
---
Cmon man, surely you know reddit well enough that no one will believe anything without a source!?
---
 There is no evidence to substantiate your claim, yeah you've got a track record but that isn't source or proof.
---
 Hey guys I am definetly gonna wint his game cause I won my last game. Look here's the result from my previous bout!  Does not mean that's a factual statement. 
---
Yeah they need to scrap the whole "needs support" feature. I could careless if people have floating bases. 
---
&gt; Little did I know that was the beginning of a journey that would see highs and lows, help me meet new friends, and give me a whole new side quest to complete. I had to overcome my fear of getting sucker punched by the B&amp;B Yao Gauis, having my pants pulled down by spooky Wendigos in order to steal their screws, meeting shady characters to do deals in car parks across Appalachia for materials everyone else just throws away, and scrapped more telephones, type writers and desk fans than I'd care to admit. Yes, I know those people are looking at me weirdly, and yes, I did say Radium Rifles. No, I'm fairly sure I'm not insane, just a touch of the Radium Fever, I'll need a few firecaps, bloodleaf and snaptails... 
---
This was such a great read! So much dedication to finding the perfect Radium rifle! Do you have any photos of your current collection to show off? What would legendary drop would be the *absolute perfect* drop for you? 
---
The only other thing I have observed is that some mods don't show up on items unless crafting at level 50. I guess you can't make level 1 weapons and armor too OP?
---
I'm up-voting for the laugh!
---
Yep, it's been happening to me a lot since the last couple of patches.. reload!
---
Shit most of my gear i use now was all dropped in doggie bags im nuke zones.  
---
Their garbage became my treasure.  
---
Listen. Magazines are heavy. I cleared out my grandma's basement a few weeks back.... Those stacks of cooking magazines end up weighing a boatload
---
I was just unlucky this time. I tried looking around thru diying several times, no bag. Not the end of the world but a lesson learned
---
happened to me too. logged in one day and i had a chassis i couldnt deply so i dropped it and it was a copy of my excavator set. all the same mods too. i  just dropped in someone's camp over the weekend. 
---
Yet ur down voting anyone saying duping wasn‚Äôt fixed.   Yes they released a patch fix, and it was bypassed within minutes of release.  
---
1. PC
---
Stuck in Power Armor and elongated limbs. Heard of these bug but have only experienced it myself (twice now, currently lvl +70) when I‚Äôm in one of the nuke bunkers.  
---
Thanks a bunch, but sad part is that most of that stuff I learned in FO4 so I was pretty careful about my inventory. Today I left a ton of junk in Grafton Station and right now in Pleasant Valley Ski Resort :D
---
For me problem was not weapons but healing stuff and chems probably because they didn't have any weight in FO4.
---
I re downloaded Destiny 2 last night, haven't played since before the first DLC came out. If the new standard is releaseing multiplayer games in a state where they're plagued by technical issues and should have been delayed, then im going to wait until those issues are taken care of. Bungee has been plagued by content issues with Destiny, but it's always been solid on the technical side. And they've split from Activision so I'm feeling genuinely hopeful that the content side of things will stabilize too.
---
It looks like all they have to do is strap jet packs on guardians to make Anthem completely irrelevant anyways.
---
I couldn't be bothered. It's the same lineup as FO4, except with fewer songs and like 2 new ones. 
---
From what I've been reading, the weight reduction is ONLY on the base weapon weight
---
This reminded me of the doc in Megaton in FO3. He was such an asshole and doing anything with him was a horrible experience. Good NPC writing, good job Bethesda
---
I could see that. I don't know why you are getting downvoted for what I thought was an obvious mis-comment!
---
It also tells you what you are gonna scrap and has you confirm it, and OP is spamming the scrap button without reading, so lol
---
I'm not downvoting anyones comments, why does everyone get so mad over dislikes?
---
What inventory glitch?
---
I love how Todd , the head of Marketing is somehow entirely responsible for every aspect of this game.
---
The ITV a few days ago said they still plan on releasing a patch for end of month.
---
Nah he needs more jet
---
I am woosh'd
---
And not just Morgan Town, other nuke areas other than WS also didn't have legendary glowing ones, if they even had glowing ones. 
---
Why does it downgrade, it's not OP by any means. It can die to a player in 1 shot too. Hopefully it doesn't down level more. Hope they fix it in the future too.
---
Hard to say.
---
It could be intended as mods don't have the legendary affix but the gun does.
---
You just keep telling yourself that 
---
All day long
---
These are some fantastic ideas, and really well thought out. We're still looking into various things with Survival mode and input like this is all reported back to the Dev's on what the community wants and thinks would make this new mode perfect for them. I personally really like the idea that a Nuke isn't told to the other players on the map. I can only imagine my heart racing as I hear the Nuke falling as I frantically look at the sky to see if it's landing near me.
---
I have Bulk and loose Steel for this exact reason, still doesn't stop it happening.
---
This is pretty much my problem. At first they all said 0/10 but randomly three of them changed to 10/10 and three other ones are stuck at 7/10 while the main list remains at 0/8. But swapping servers resets the list temporarily, and no matter what I do I cannot get any of the counters to change. I actually tried making a new character to see if it would help but it didn't.
---
I only listen to the radio when I am part of a team. When going alone I am too busy trying to keep an eye out.
---
I finally got it to work and I know for sure I saw it appear within a 10 second window because I was in and out of the map looking at a wanted player. Good quest, good items.
---
Is he the guy who was stuck outside his power armor? We had a naked guy who wasn‚Äôt taking rad damage but couldn‚Äôt get back into it. 
---
At first I thought this headline was going to be for r/letsnotmeet sub then I saw it was Fallout and was like "oh that makes sense". 
---
Dupers ruined my credit and ate my sandwich from the break room. DAMN YOU DUPERS!!!
---
Oh, I didn't even knew about these two. So yeah, in that case it would be to add more. 
---
I wonder how many rejects they produce.  In fairness the screws Apple uses are tiny tiny tiny. 
---
It's two shot, each bullet diverges from the centre which makes accuracy pretty poor in vats. Shotguns are insanely bad in vats too. 
---
I thought that they stopped dropping cores from Robobrains and only Sentry Bots do it now?  
---
In any case, nope...  but, that's all I'll say on the topic... (grin)
---
They'll figure it out someday.
---
You sound kinda like the dude what was super upset they hid the challenges so well from them. Its not like you dont scroll past the challenges everytime you quit/exit the server?
---
Maybe I'm a little messed in the head, but if there is a button to push and I dont know what that button does, im sure AF gonna push that button. I dont need a tooltip to explain it for me.
---
Get curious, explore the UI, push some buttons and see what happens, it might surprise you or you might learn something. Either way, win-win.
---
And side note, Atom shop makes the ingame cosmetics, dunno if they have much to do with coding.
---
It is unlikely that ‚Äúdupers‚Äù would do so in a dangerous environment-whether in terms of enemies or server stability. 
---
Thank you! :)
---
In between your creepy rapey vibes, you make a good point. 
---
Where‚Äôd you get that mask?
---
This is going to be fixed next patch, I understand that frustration completely! Thankfully it will no longer be an issue after this.
---
My best gun is an executioners explosive radium rifle. It‚Äôs great in VATS builds and in general. The healing on some enemies is negligible, and it‚Äôs a general powerhouse in most spots. I prefer the automatic receiver, no scope, and if I had suppressor I would use it.
---
Glad to see someone else out there likes the feel of the radium rifle.
---
The fuss is broke ass gamers who have never bought anything made of leather finding out leather isn't cheap.
---
$276 for a leather jacket is cheap. Tbh i doubt its even a good leather at that price.
---
You got it, Boss Hogg!
---
Reading this thread showed me that the pvp community is toxic.
---
How would duping even apply to running really fast, are you sure it wasn't a joke?
---
I'm sure there are some in town, but I usually go east to the flooded train yard for the weapon and armor bench.  There is an armor bench west of town at the NAR repair yard.
---
Let's not talk crazy here.
---
I have found the witch hat, no costume. Where do you get a costume? 
---
No need, i dont feel like losing anymore iq points today. So you are having issues with the vendors and grahm attacking you then? Maybe the whitesprings robots have formed a gang i dont know about and are mercilessly targeting you at every opportunity?
---
it's the monster mash event mask 
---
Well said..
---
That is some solid "Got your back".
---
[](/ajhappy)
---
You too. Get angry at stuff you don't understand
---
My camp doesn't load from time to time because there's a junk spot down the road and if they build their camp on the south side of the junk spot they're close enough to prevent my camp from spawning. Mind you, the Junk spot is so far away I can't shoot things attacking it's extractor with my sniper rifle with all the long range trimmings from my camp, but still too close if they go on the south side.
---
Ive been Duped!! dang dupers ! LMAO people are funny 
---
It was not my intention. It was just my honest feelings of how much I like the world and my hope for what FO76 could become (A mix of amazement for the world itself, hope for what it may become and annoyance with the wack systems)
---
(Not OP) Considering Radiums are my go-to,
---
VATS reduction extra crit damage with any of the big affixes but not two shot(explosive, anti-armor, even bloodied). Would pay out the nose for that. Would even consider doing the insane farm this guy did to learn the mods.
---
There or north of Abbie‚Äôs bunker would have been my guess. Seems I just haven‚Äôt been lucky enough to find the 91 yet. Thank ya 
---
I love hearing stories and seeing videos of players nuking different locations. My first nuke I hit the Grafton Damn and had a lot of fun (And deaths) fighting off Legendary Super Mutant Masters. It was a cool change of pace! 
---
High school has the chem bench, train station has the tinkers, big bend tunnel has the power armor , weapons and armor workbenches.
---
I can see this being a really good thing IF they enable pacifist mode for CAMPs.  
---
With the current number of jackholes blowing up camps, it wouldn't be used by more than a few people at most.  
---
If CAMPs could be set as pacifist/invulnerable to players, it would be a great little addition, especially for vendors.
---
I could care less. Its just funny that anyone who replied to u got down-voted.  
---
I can't remember what Yao Gauis drop but there's usually one dead near any SQ spawn point. Many of them are unmarked small fissures. They give either spings or screws, I think springs. They are nearly as valuable and can be traded about 1:1.
---
Ohhh. That the one that glitches out and stays in your inventory? I‚Äôm gonna have to do that event. 
---
The mode will be for everyone, they want ppl to pvp more, not make a mode for pvpers.
---
Its gonna be the way they said it will be as i doubt they even have the ability to seperate characters and modes.
---
To be fair...
---
Imagine the game without fast travelling, the map would have so much more meaning.  
---
\- Bases would be harder to find so you can keep your camp a secret easier.  
---
\- After killing a player, you dont have to worry about him respawning on top of you again. Only his teammates or other players nearby who heard the gunfire!  
---
\- Players would need to use the terrain to move without getting spotted. Every rock, every tree becomes important.
---
I just ignore the a-hole responses and respond to the decent people. I don't have time to read every single post on reddit so I posted my scenario with a request for clarification.
---
If people want to be rude, let them stroke their own misinflated egos, their lives are obviously lacking any real joy and meaning. 
---
You're clearly spamming the comment button without reading, so lol
---
I get ya.  But I'm not holding my breath for anything with me having the asthma and all.   You can literally listen to music while you game.  This isn't a futuristic dystopian world where developers hunt you for listening to music. 
---
I will watch a player do their thing for 30 irl minutes yes
---
Carrying 20,000 TSE shotguns makes you run really fast, duh.
---
Nope, don't think so
---
If you could care less, why bring it up?
---
Added to edit didn't knew about it.
---
Find a dead witch on the rd near the crevasse dam and hope you get the plans. 
---
I doubt it is server stability given you are limited to the number they will produce. They will never hold more then 3 and 5 respectivly at any given time unless you take from them. 
---
I use the excavator. At first because I could carry so much.   Then I got used to it.  Just yesterday I finally got my second calibrated shock for it.   
---
I think I‚Äôve just grown attached to its unique look.     If I could get Calibrated shocks for the x-01 I think it looks the sleekest.  Though my Nuka Cola 51 is awesome looking I barely use it.  
---
Some of the mods can only be learned by scrapping and some only by plans. There is no overlap.
---
Look for the clouds of flies.
---
same why I thought it would be a good idea since int boosts a lot in other games 
---
I keep a camp out there on XBox. I jump across to the island and trigger the death claw and then go back to my camp to snipe it. They wont cross the water.
---
Because i noticed it.  So i called it out.  
---
Yeah because the melee builds are whata killong the sbq in 3 mins.
---
Possibly putting all of their SWAG in the bag so that they could divide up who wanted what.
---
Then you stroll in and steal it all, prompting salty gunfire.  Then again, it seems you may be mining salt or looking for some type of attention here for an otherwise unknown nefarious purpose.
---
See how people might see different thing when looking at a situation, yet?  Or are you up to shenanigans?
---
Mm hmm
---
monkaS
---
Nope, but this is a world where it pays dividends to be risk averse.
---
Username checks out
---
you apparently never played any game with pvp and pve servers then as 98% of all pvpers sit safely on pve servers and keep their best stuff safely there same reason people attack in most sandboxes while people are asleep not when awesome battle of tactics and skill would happen 
---
not to mention with no slap a instigating rifle from sneak player will basically 1 shot you or a pulse land mine against someone in power armor 
---
Explains where all the jet went.
---
Agree with all points here OP.  Cheers!
---
I just started playing but I agree with everything you said. That would make things so much more immersive!
---
&gt; I believe one solution, and I *think* many would agree, is to substantially buff heavy weapons. Take for example the missile launcher. It's not really a weapon you want to use on your average opponent while farming lead. It's heavy as hell and missiles aren't available in crazy numbers, not to mention their weight. But I feel like when I break that bad boy out, it's for a reason, and what better reason than taking out an irradiated flying ~~rat~~ bat? 
---
I see this feedback on buffing heavy weapons and I feel it as well as a Melee/Heavy Guns build personally too. There is something to be said about the perks that can be equipped to buff the damage from heavy weapons but overall the community has been asking for more. Dev's are aware of these feelings and I've included it in my reports.
---
Damn, sorry to hear that.
---
Point period end. Theyre going to do this with EVERY weappn exploit in the game. AA will take a hit after someone finds a game breaking exploit same with melee. Theyll come to reddit cry about it enough just like TSE when, theres a shit load of other actual problems and boom. Its lazy, rebalancing the schematics and actual weapon classes would take time, they waste all there precipus time giving us racecar and princess beds.
---
This games a fucking joke.
---
There's a legendary effect for reduced damage output to enemies.  Perhaps a similar mechanic for DR?  (sorry for the necro)
---
Thank you :)
---
My camp is south east next to firebase Hancock or whatever it is called in the cranberry bog.
---
Me and my friends hang out at the munations factory because ammo and free fast travel. 
---
Now imagine spawning in joining a party then realizing BOTH of you are going to have to walk for a whole hour just to meet in the middle of the map. And then walk back to get your ammo. 
---
That's a no from me dawg.
---
Build a camp build a camp!
---
That's what a duper would say
---
Have you ever farmed a nuke zone or glowing ones in whitesprings? If yes, you were getting more xp than Bethesda intended and therefore were taking advantage of a bug. Not trying to say you cheated or exploited the game but many players were getting way more xp than they should have. Me included
---
Phenix, I believe you.  But the idea that another ban wave is coming is unsurprising, as I imagine such will always be the case.   Determining what selectivity criteria are used for auto-banning would be far more valuable.   Because Bethesda‚Äôs algorithms seem flawed based on the anecdotes observed in this subforum. 
---
Poor choice of words and I wanted clarification on it. I don't have time to read every single thread on this community, so I posted my experience. 
---
People can answer with actual help, or be a-holes about it, whatever. 
---
T60 legs don't take screws or springs to repair with power patcher. I don't know about otherwise, but I used them for a custom paint job. Now I'm keeping them lol.
---
This.

its also really annoying in pvp to keep getting hit by as those rads build up faster then most people notice 
---
Hey Bolo. Me and Edgar say hello. Good night of mischief. 
---
Edgar would comment, but he's banned for a couple days.
---
no sink plan at all, or clean/unbroken versions of the toilet and bath
---
That‚Äôs how they are now. I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs intentional from Bethesda or not since reduction perks obviously effect mods. And 90% doesn‚Äôt do much if the majority weight comes from the mods attached and not the weapon itself 
---
All fun and games, till someone realizes that they can play horror movie / game sounds through their mic and go on to scare people :)
---
&gt; Did you know that the damaged Hazmat suit at 500 rad resist has the same protection as the Hazmat suit at 1000?
---
That's just how the resistance formula works and would be the same if you could get 1000 ballistic or energy resistance.
---
It's actually mathematically brilliant, adding more resistance never makes you invincible against the same attack but improves your mitigation against larger hits.
---
Radiation damage as you've noticed is a large number of small hits. A few pieces of 25 rad resist armor with lead-lined mods actually make a significant difference.
---
PA and hazmat suits give "protect from environmental hazards" though which is an additional radiation damage reduction. That should be enabled for other players via an under-armor and/or perk.
---
Get the Xbox app for your phone bro. Makes stuff like this a bit easier. 
---
Cheating by the players is unacceptable it comes down to the individuals decision to cheat. However, BGS created a game without enough safeguards to prevent or track cheaters. They definitely shoulder some of the blame for this mess called Fallout 76. Excuses are like assh*les every one got one.
---
Truth. 
---
There were plenty of exploits, this was just one example of players getting more xp from a bug. Some people abused that
---
Groups do dump unwanted legendaries into containers for the rest of the group to see if there's anything they want.
---
On the kinda-shady side, I saw about 100 one-star legendaries in the ice chest at the golf club last week. It wasn't duping, but rather all the items they didn't want after some intense glitch-exploiting farming. They had one team member relogging which forced the nuked glowing ghouls to respawn quickly, over and over. The server did crash but I don't know whether their forced-respawn scheme was related to it.
---
On my next login (different server now) I checked the golf club ice chest again and that also had a bunch of legendaries (different and fewer than the last one though), maybe from another group doing the same.
---
Well ain't he/she the cutest, haven't seen that yet :) did you play with it? 
---
True. I do tend to forget about flux as I haven't needed any in a long time. The Bog must still be the best for violet though?  I'm just tired of hearing about 'the new Whitesprings' etc. I realize YouTubers want views but everything about '76 has already been covered, until we get new content and/or balance changes anyway.
---
 Sure I would love it, but it is not very likely to happen.
---
I think the point is that another 45 HP probably won't save you from that situation.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I have a 90% reduced weight shotgun and it weighs like 9 pounds. Meaning it would normally weigh like 100 pounds which isn‚Äôt true. 
---
Would be cool to see other areas of the maps have mini bosses. Nuke events spawning patterns change up from normal spots. Nuke events where mobs get challenging.
---
Currently nothing is a challenge in nuke zones at all. Even without TSE or melee weapons.
---
Take Whitespring:
---
Imagine seeing every 5 minute intervals a hulking ghoul that gives armor to nearby ghouls and glowing ghouls that explode.
---
The longer you remain in a nuke zone the harder it should get. The more enemies that should appear. Currently you spend 90% of your time looking for someone to shoot. Imagine if at the 15 minute mark of a nuke it took players remaining close to each other. Fending off hordes of ghouls and targetting the big ones spawning in to stop them buffing up the little ones.
---
What if at the very end before the nuke was about to end a three ghoul boss fight. That required them all to die within x seconds of each other to stop one reviving the other two?.
---
That's awesome!!! And it really demostrates why we need new content
---
Damn... I never could get into fallout 1 and 2 since I heard about and played 3 first
---
I'm not the one who lost valuable X-01 mods to a well known glitch, so lol.
---
If you would for a moment, try to see eye to eye with me and respond without all the mysticisms of a corporate world.
---
When did you listen to music last?  Do you listen to music while you game?  What are the chances of federal agents coming to get you?  
---
Okkkayy...
---
Believe whatever you want. Maybe one day soon youll get capped and become a believer. The pacifist mode happened to me a couple weeks ago. Or youll see the sbq get clean 1 shot and become a believer. That happened 1 or 2 days ago.
---
You do you champ. If you stack 1000000 bobbleheads then even 0.1% damage in pacifist mode eventually becomed 100%. 
---
The amount of serious that you take a game is exactly what makes greifing pretty fun.
---
Yes I encounter that vendor 2 days ago , selling all kind of nuka cola, even nuka dark.
---
The moth man shrine ( the main one ) mostly collecting outfits and power armor here nowadays 
---
LOL fucking LOL \^\^part of the problem\^\^
---
Okay kid.
---
It is an imperfect, wonderful game.  
---
Damn...wish we had them.
---
But how did he know what was in your inventory?
---
The horror continues
---
This is a known issue and we're investigating a fix for it. 
---
You can. Place the blue wall switch on the inside of the gate on the same side, just below the connector on the outside. Then attach a wire from the connector on the outside of  to the switch you mounted inside. That's how mine is wired.
---
Thanks, fella!
---
Thats one thing I was actually really hoping for Fallout 76 to have!
---
I usually just hit a couple people up I‚Äôm close too. I had a guy, level 5 wanted, was 5 the hour I was playing. I got a message asking for a merciful death. I obliged as I figured if your at wanted 5 or 10 and NOT going higher in an hour it must have been an accident. 
---
I killed him, guarded his junk and compensated him some loose junks and recipes I had for his cap lose. 
---
There is an achievement/trophy for killing players so just send a few messages in server. 
---
You should be able to harvest 5 blooming pods, server hop and do it again.  If you load in at Dryer chem and they are not blooming, just quit and do it again.  I pulled enough to make about 75 radshields in 45 minutes of game hopping.
---
Do you have a date for the next patch?
---
They are really smart to buy. They usually cost like 100 caps, some of them are special and might not be unlocked with scrapping.
---
Of course buying them requires either the mod to show which ones you have, or waiting for next patch to hopefully give that to everyone.
---
Sometimes I find like 3 weapon mod plans on a vendor I don't have, I'm like oohh, whopping 3.
---
I thought it might have been that, or someone that didn't key in the code correctly and had only 1 card on them.
---
Dumping my holos worked.  Forgot to advise. 
---
Is the nuka soup just nuka-cola in a bowl.
---
They also left a big dupe in the bathroom and DIDN'T FLUSH!!!
---
At the beginning they tried to warn the rest that you are about to get in the house then someone said that `too late he is in`. 
---
after that I didnt notice really.
---
It seemed to be a tournament with turns to fight but I didnt heard what was at stake. I will give a second try if you want to know more.
---
I think you should have stayed :) 
---
This is fine. Everything is fine. 
---
Im on Ps4, so no modding for me but I see your point.  
---
No, you're the one trolling without actually understanding the nature of the well known glitch, and making out that it's the player's fault for falling victim to it rather than the developer's fault for the glitch existing and not being fixed sooner, so lol.
---
Some of the places are redone real well. 
---
Harpers Ferry &amp; Maryland Heights . though they should have included the cemetery at the top of the hill. 
---
Berkeley Springs.  Though the bath houses could have been better emphasized.  
---
Green bank Telescope !  Awesome - nice if they could have added Cass and the railroad also.  
---
Dolly Sods feels just right !  
---
Camden Yards is perfect ! 
---
Although Spruce Knob isn‚Äôt accurate,  it feels like they got inspired by top of Clingmans Dome in the Smoky Mountains that looks very late 50/60‚Äôs style.  
---
nice, didn't know that :)

---
Welcome to my world.  I'm at 110% stored and nothing stored.  I literally can't even build a stash.  This has been the case for about two weeks now and Bethesda support was completely useless.  Actually that's not fair, they were even less helpful than completely useless because they were rude too.  So only thing to do was start a new character which is what I did.  I'm really enjoying the game, but the response I got from Bethesda regarding my problem has really left a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Nothing in the Atomic Shop will make you BETTER at the game though, it just gives you some unique looking things. There is a difference but if they start adding buffs, etc. to the store then it'll become an issue. Also you can earn literally all of it by playing the game. Sure it might take a while but it's still free unless you want to pay to get it quicker
---
The servers scale as needed, there is not a finite amount of them. As demand increases more servers come online, and as demand decreases servers shut down.
---
The easiest way to make sure you dont come back to the problem server is to block or block for session the problem player. Blocking them should permanetly make it so they cant join the same server as you, and blocking for sessions works til you log out/CTD (CrashToDesktop).
---
The client generally wants to connect you to the closest/fastest server, which is why it might have kept dropping you into that server if there wasnt a compareable/better server near you.
---
Imo, between the ban waves for duping/exploiting, people burning out due to lack of new content (I'm mid 300 hrs, so there is content for sure, some just need something fresh), issues with griefers scaling up because of boredom and a borked pvp/flaggin set up, a bunch of people, myself included are either on a short term break or have left the game completely. Which might explain the servers being a bit quiet.
---
Pacifist mode doesnt reduce by % but ok.
---
I play solo so sqb is safe and i don't capture workshops.
---
I'll be fine.
---
Then you're running out of steel scrap. The game takes raw steel scrap first, then mods that yield steel (which is dumb, yes, and getting fixed in the next patch), then bulked steel.
---
After last patch, my screen goes to picture, to ingame loading sounds to a glitched out view of where im spawning.
---
Makes the sounds of me and my camp spawning im, the goes right back to a loading screen they i finally get loaded in.  
---
Remind me not to go the bars you guys visit, bloodbath in the village.
---
That's what I'm starting to think is happening.
---
It's pretty good, I get to see bunch of fleshbags eat spoiled hotdogs for a few park tokens.
---
Kill him and eat his wing paper
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4380
---
I only ever had it highlight corpses.
---
Great pics! Didn't know that there even is a glowing one. I'm roughly 250h in the game and had only 3 encounters with a vengeful of his kind.
---
She prefers her corgis.
---
Next thing you're going to expect people to stop calling everyone that kills a legendary without letting them tag it first a griefer.
---
No, read the title man - I had plenty of both bulked and loose steel when this happened.
---
I'm level 248 and I feel my budget stagnated at about level 200.  
---
I agree the budget should be increased, but Bethesda is going to run into a bottle-necking problem with the Atom Shop.  *Why buy things if you can't use them because the budget is too small?*  
---
How about making Atom shop items cost zero budget OR you get so many that don't count towards budget?  I.e., Twinkle-Lights you get (6) free, and the Fish-tank Lamp you get 1 because the twinkle lights don't visually work as a single item display.
---
;)
---
I think the new mode adds a missing gameplay loop at least for me. As I'm digging the mmo survival pvp style fallout alot so far
---
I mainly use it for selling, but recently I've needed some for crafting. Violet is always in reliable spots in Morgantown, and I always struggle to find it out in the bog, but that could be because I have a hard time navigating it
---
As far as a new whitesprings goes, I don't think there's a better place to nuke if you want to farm legendaries, but it can get tiring going to the same place and seeing everyone use two shot explosives, which I'm sick of anyway
---
I completely agree! I really like your idea for having the Nuke zones get harder the longer you're in them and having unique objectives inside them as well. I think there's a lot of room to have fun with Nuke zones that we can explore.
---
yeah that's true, i am excited about survival mode though
---
springs from yao gui, screws from wendigos and megasloths
---
People call those who take too little damage or deal too much damage dupers because you can achieve that state of mind by duping bobbleheads. And this post makes you look like you are unfamiliar with that, and though yell at others. It's kind of annoying, you know.
---
I'd be happy with one of those bikes you see around. 
---
Think about it I know how to fix a bike irl why can't my guy who can build a computerized Lazer rilfe out of old forks and copper mined from the ground not fix the chain or wheel of a bike? 
---
You can judge me all you want - I'll gladly spit and spite on what I consider as bad behavior and call it as I see it.  But I can't honestly fault them for it entirely - its the same thing as dupers, they're just exploiting a flaw in the game, only not as badly as dupers were.  This whole tag for XP and full loot is amateur night for an online multiplayer game.
---
Proper game design requires distinguishing between kills and kill assists - the latter should award a lot less XP.  Group boss fights should be designed to award rewards based on contribution to the kill.  Non player kills (like base turrets) should award partial XP.  Endgame loot needs to be level locked so the stuff SBQ drops should only be awarded to lv. 50 and up.  And so on.
---
A more important question is do we need them more than bug fixes and stability changes.
---
No npcs doesn't ruin anything for me personally.
---
There‚Äôs nothing better than murdering with ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we were older!‚Äù, in the background lol
---
Wow. This is new to me. Do you know when they refresh?
---
Well, I mostly use non-automatic guns in FO76 (and FO4), but when I use automatic guns I find that I miss a *lot* more shots than the sight picture would indicate. I have seen a lot of complaints about this from others as well. And yes, that's both in and out of VATS. 
---
My guess is that the game fails to register proper hit detection on the server, meaning that whatever you're trying to shoot just doesn't get the memo that you shot it, but I don't know enough about how the client - server communication works to figure out if I'm right. 
---
Fire rate may be a factor too. 
---
Indeed Devann i would love to see what the lads come up with for the Mire. That place is insanely creepy and i have a feeling a boss choice there would be a stealthy one if ya get my drift lol...
---
the ones you learn from plans are pretty trash though, i think it's mainly the NV scopes
---
Well if you are so sure about that, your mistake was selling the "duped" items to the vendor bot. So, if those things were duped you've putted some inconscious player in risk to be banned.
---
You had to drop all the weapons in the river.
---
100 bobbleheads is nothing if you don't really use or sell them. I had 30 and I was just level 25 at the time. I never remembered to use them and didn't realize they were 1 pound each, so I used 20 for the achievement and sold the test. Now I just pick them up and sell them, but I would easily have over 100 if I hoarded them.
---
It is currently *planned* for tomorrow. I'm waiting for more final details before we officially announce the maintenance on our forums.
---
Speaking of inflated egos, you assume someone is cheating just because they killed you twice?
---
So far, mostly T\_60 motion assist servo plans. A couple of Excavator MAS plans, and one piece of heavy combat armor (leg). I'm in t for T-60 crafting plans. :(
---
I have T60 now and that's what I am using with calibrated shocks. Carry weight is 350 I believe.
---
I was fighting the queen last night and the armor was fine. I have the American Patriot paint on mine.
---
Honestly I'd love to see this, I feel that player interaction in the Appalachia is just meh. Have had a some good interactions and I know we're in a wasteland but how do we rebuild America without reputable builders, traders and production?
---
That's my point man lol
---
Not really.
---
Ppl sell bobbleheads for 100 caps. 
---
It would take awhile to get enough but it's possible
---
&gt;That place is insanely creepy and i have a feeling a boss choice there would be a stealthy one if ya get my drift lol...
---
I see what you did there ahaha. Yes the Mire is awesome! Nothing like seeing the silhouette of a Fogcrawler or Mirelurk Queen in the distance in the fog....... 
---
There was one were people could get stuff from your inventory. I still won't trade with randoms. Only friends.
---
There was a Deathclaw companion in Fallout 2, who weared a labcoat when not in combat. I think his name was Garys or something like this.
---
Oh no, he must have stolen the jet recipe from the dev room. It's too late to stop him
---
&gt;Something's got to give
---
Oh you
---
Beth is fixing it because of crybabies like you, but you should have paid more attention to what you had in your inventory, dude. 
---
I have that mod.  I bought most of my plans before I had that mod.  I certainly bought a few duplicates.  I tried to be careful, but the mod is really nice for now.  I am looking forward to it being built into the game itself.  
---
"I am become turret"? 
---
:D
---
I have zero problem with the formula that incorporates diminishing returns.  You have to have that or, like you said, someone could be invulnerable.  However, I do have a problem with Rad resist not being equal.  500 rad resist in a damaged hazmat suit is 10 times more effective than twice that much Rad resist outside of it.  That's an issue.  
---
If I was assuming, I would have reported it without asking this reddit community for clarification. 
---
Is that difficult for you to understand? 
---
Indeed lol anyway i gotta get back to work. I will check back in later. Just noticed you posted on the sub.
---
Have a good night Devann and talk to you next time as always. :)
---
how exactly does this work? i claim shops all the time for the xp and mats and walk away. with pacifist always on, i've never been killed or engaged in pvp without turning it off.
---
At this point I've failed more daily quests due to disconnects than I've completed, so typically I don't bother trying to do them. The lost quest that prompted this post was shooting three different (specific) animals with a special syringer (i'll try not to spoil anything too much).
---
I found the first animal pretty quick, searched and searched for the second and instead stumbled upon the third type. Made a pit stop at the Whitespring station to deconstruct a couple things and ran into a level 80 Scorchbeast that was chasing a level 14 guy. I killed the beast with the help of the robots, went back to the station to give a thumbs up to the level 14 guy and server crashed.
---
Only had one more animal to find, but upon logging back in, all gone. Another failed daily in the past involved trying to find a shovel which was the final step to this quest. After searching for 30 minutes, crash and lost all progress. 
---
In both of these cases, it probably wouldn't have been too bad to just restart, but when there's not even an option, it's frustrating. The ideal solution of course would be to have the ability to pick up where you left off whether you log out or get disconnected. 
---
This is interesting. I think the reason behind it still being open is so if a player is struggling, others can come to their aid to help. Having it locked by team is a interesting idea and take on it. 
---
I was almost done with fully crafting the excavator power armor, over encumbered with a bunch of needed scrap, slowly making my back south through the ash heep to finish the build (the whole thing took forever for me). Two supply drops appear right near me so i go to check them out. Turns out it was PvP bait with some level 140-160 guys looking for a fight (i was probably level 30). Didnt notice till one of them on the mic was like "oh oh oh heres one!". He takes a potshot at me "hey man, fight me fight me!" "No sorry man i got shit to do, gotta run." So he's jumping all of the over the place chasing me and taking shots begging me to fight him, pretty sure he's drunk at this point "cmon man, please fight me dude, i promise i wont take your shit!" "Haha no way man, you guys are like level 1,000, you'll completely wreck me." They laughed, kept jump chasing me then they got bored and took off thank christ. Thought i was about to lose everything.
---
That was proved to be false quite awhile ago.
---
What, that you make a shitty argument? 
---
How can you confirm ghouls are there before you nuke it? Have a buddy scope it out while you do the silo? 
---
Recently someone nuked Monangah (and my camp as a result) but it was just mole miners and not very many. Curious what the best way to confirms it‚Äôs worth it before you launch 
---
It's pretty interesting. If you follow conversations and explore, you see many references to jet's effects on the world long before you reach New Reno. Smaller ones include just seeing addicts walking around cities like the Den, but if you probe into it you can figure out that Redding is basically a puppet show selling gold for jet, and there is a (I think cut) quest to work with the doctor to help solve the issue.
---
Radiation loss on death was a glitch that Bethesda fixed. Only way to remove rads other than radaways is a decontamination shower. Some people have them at their camps, each power plant has one tho it‚Äôs a pain to get to or there‚Äôs one in the enclave bunker thru the service entrance. 
---
Does it actually fire at things? Unlike the default turrets...
---
Fallout: Radium? Whats that? :) Anyhow, I'm curious ... how does the Radium Rifle hold up as an end-game weapon? What is the best load-out? I have a crit-commando I'm planning, who is all about automatic weapons and crits. But I wonder if autofire is an option on the radium and how you feel about it overall?
---
Why do you people insist that every high level player is a duper? I cant take this community seriously anymore 
---
Almost like we should have home servers we belong to. To ensure we can develop a community to create connections with. üòú
---
I was gonna say the same thing you beat me to it
---
At least you can see the flies.  I prefer this. 
---
Good one
---
 Good one 
---
Stealth boy?
---
This isn't a terrible idea.
---
Pretty much go there before you head to the silo (or have a buddy check) and hope the cell doesn't reset before the nuke hits.
---
Mech Warrior's unite
---
Bongo, bongo, bongo...
---
I can easily say, with full confidence, that you're not the only one. LoLs. Looks good tho
---
I didn't say that I wanted to play a pure shooter.  I've played Fallout before. I did say that I wanted to spend less time playing the inventory management game.   Again back to my point, it would be a good reward for players who make it to higher levels / higher time investment.   
---
Bethesda adds a new cryptid, a botchling
---
Fisto when you're crazy enough
---
Dupers are the new synths of Fallout.
---
haha, yes, it's me!
---
Yeah iirc that was a recent change on the last patch. Decontamination showers will rid you of rads (and mutations). There's one in Blackwater Mine, might be a tad over your head at lvl 22 though, lol. Only other options I'm aware of are the Whitesprings Bunker, or knowing someone with one at their camp (Me and many others). Could be others that I cannot recall though.
---
You clearly don't understand the issue or how the glitch "just works" so you're not qualified to comment. Go troll elsewhere.
---
It only take "fertilizer" and plastic to make it in Fallout 4.
---
It's rare, but it definitely happens.  Seems to be during super-intense fights with tons of crap exploding all around me.  If the entire game slowed down and not just me, it would be like the old NES Advantage Joystick "slow motion" button whose job was just to automatically hit the pause button thousands of times in rapid succession.
---
There are definitely legal issues with copyrighted music. The idea in itself is a fun one! But pretty complicated in that sense. 
---
Two Shot, Explosive legendary weapons.  In current form they do \~400% (4x) the damage of a regular non legendary version.
---
If you look closely, you can notice there's a gatling gun in ~~my~~ turret's hands. And it fires at things, yes.
---
As a ranged player, my primary goal during SBQ is crippling limbs and getting her on the ground for melee to have at. While they're going ham on her, I'm keeping adds off their backs with serial headshots, OR Cryolating/tormenting/suppressing her like no other if that's being handled. YMMV, this is what works for me.
---
The question is, did the scorched firing a radium rifle at you end up dropping a pump action shotgun?
---
I didn't know either! I don't know how rare these encounters are, but I have yet to see the Flatwood monster! 
---
not that... I'd ever do that.... (slides two shot mirv fatman under the table)
---
Very much so! Thx so much!
---
two shot automatic with +25% fire speed will demolish your rad meter
---
This main post will be dead in a day
---
But he was so nice to me! =\]
---
Unless you've been hoarding (or keeping a bunch of stable flux on you), it's not a major loss. I mean, it stinks. I totally get your anger and I would be right there with you. But let the anger pass. You'll be right back there soon enough.
---
Yep. It wouldn't make much sense as a default, but would be good for people that wanted to use it.
---
Doubt it.
---
Inside the vault usually details a patch for the following week.
---
Maybe inside the vault will drop shortly with a patch over the weekend? But i have my doubts
---
Pacifist doesnt protect you from other players damage, it just means you cant fight back
---
I deliberately didn't keep a count of the radiums, it would've been too harrowing! I'm thinking somewhere around 500. Even with super duper taken into account, we're talking say 350 x 15 screws, 13 springs. Absolute horror show.
---
Definitely a cool idea in theory. There are legal concerns with copyrighted music that we don't already have the ability play in our existing radios. I do like the idea of players being able to be their own DJ! I know I for sure would be my own rendition of Three Dog..... Three Cat "Meow meowww" ... anyone? Just me? Okay...
---
I don't think he could, just noticed my health being low.  The first time he saw me on map, I think he ran to me to meet and greet before i fled.  The second time, he noticed I was almost dead and gave me a bunch of diluted Stims. 
---
Also, sometimes something exploded and sent a body flying, so then I really have no chance of finding the body.
---
This happened to me twice this morning in a span of a single hour. Had captured workshops both times. Haven't played since. 
---
I killed a legendary chicken last week. It had a level 1 furious rolling pin.
---
they are quite bony...
---
Yes, that happens to literally everybody, lol. That's not the point.
---
The person attacking you has to first engage in claiming the workshop. After that you are a free target
---
Ya think! Upvoted
---
They're isn't an argument here. I've provided proof that stacked bobbleheads in a controlled test doesn't bypass slap damage.
---
Your argument is about feelings and words with no proof that resorts to personal attacks because you have nothing to back it up.
---
That‚Äôs a neat idea, have my upvote.
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
He wasn't hostile? 
---
There is nothing I don‚Äôt like about that sentence.
---
another guy replied a bit earlier and i think he might be pc, perhaps you could team up?
---
Uhhh yea, wouldnt be surprised. Unfortunately people arent making enough of a hype about the numerous ones that arent working.
---
 Ot if you convinced yourself to use Heavy Weapons... fucking Stabalized how I loathe you.
---
LOL
---
These are the kind of stories I love to read! I will personally chase down low level players I see and drop Rad-Away and  Water. It really is fun to help out others and quest with them.

I see way too many posts about people just throwing the word griefer around just because there was a slight inconvenience 
---
2 hours without going to a stash?
---
Sounds like you were asking to lose stuff
---
There are huge amounts in the bog but not immediately obvious. It's virtually all under the trees so I used to just go tree to tree in a big loop. Yeah I tend to avoid Whitesprings nowadays, after living there for quite a while. If you want 1 star legendary items it's the place to go though  haha
---
So true
---
yeah, there's a few that can only be learned through plans, mainly the NV scopes and Prime Receivers
---
Quick question - I know about the idea of crippling limbs, just wonder if this is limited to VATS only or if its possible to just target the limbs to cripple it (assuming one has the various perks that have a chance of crippling)?
---
Dude rule of thumb, guy has more than 60 cap bounty he's decked out in sentinel) assassin and is just baiting people.
---
Why did u put it in stash lol
---
Impressive jet pack or not 
---
But he's friendly like a good boi :(
---
This is interesting. What console are you on? Are you using Power Armor with any mods on it? 
---
Why that weapon is really bad
---
I've had great interactions with others, and had my CAMP blown off the map a couple of times.  
---
I normally welcome people in and leave everything unlocked, but even so, I'm getting gun-shy enough that I almost insta-logged when some players showed up the other night.  The damage they can do in moments is insane.  
---
That said, my son wants sooo badly to have a restaurant, where he can cook for others.  He really only needs three things.  
---
A working fridge (spoilage is too much of an issue for rare ingredients), a way to advertise, and a way to not have the place shredded in under 30 seconds.
---
"The technology just isn't there yet"
---
Agreed. It's a game, people *game* its mechanics. It's not just low-levels, either. Why would I drop several thousand rounds of ammo and the mats for repairing a few guns if I simply do not need to invest any of that and still receive the same rewards? I have no problem investing those resources if it's necessary, but it's simply not necessary.
---
why can't you store weapons? I have a whole bunch of rifles and huge amounts of mats and I managed somehow...
---
Then get better at cherry picking loot quickly. If you are always looting all from everything, that's your failure to play the game well.
---
If you use a jet pack and find a big power line tower next to a cliff you can fly on top of it. It‚Äôs actually got a large invisible floor on top you can build a decent amount on, and you can expand it by using rugs and place them half on each other so the other half hangs off and makes the floor bigger. 
---
You shouldnt have to waste time going into the menu to turn on a game setting just to bypass shitty game mechanics 
---
It is kind of hard to believe this a glitch rather than user error, yes.
---
I had that exact day happen to me in the Ash Heap yesterday
---
if you're on ps4 i'm more than happy to help you mod it, you sound like a person after my own heart!
---
I had to server hop like 40 times to find him... It's hard!
---
Yeah got mine from Raider vendor and you just haven‚Äôt seen a good 3 star one yet I have one and love it when I‚Äôm farming
---
Everyone ‚Äî including Bethesda ‚Äî already agrees this game mechanic should be fixed, and it will be.
---
This post therefore amounts to a bleat of outrage from a particularly slow learner.
---
Imagine 100+ player persistent survival servers with no map player markers and reasons to go to 'other' areas of the map, endgame wise with all the above OP suggestions.
---
Why is this awful 4chan format here
---
Are you or is someone you are grouped with using a targeting HUD? Removing mine has resolved most of my CTD issues. 
---
Just destroyed my armor from this quest. How the fuck is Bethesda going to be worst than fucking Wildcard with updates/fixes?
---
Like some others, I have T-60 legs with CS, and X-01 everything else. Until I find the CS for X-01. Seeing as how I stop in at the Enclave bunker daily and have still never seen it, I'm not convinced that I'll ever have a full X-01 set that I use.
---
I also have a full set of Ultracite, but it's mostly unmodded, so it's not really worth using. Plus, it's expensive to repair.
---
It happened to me and I got 13 legendaries. Also yes I think it‚Äôs the after math if the nuke
---
I've definitely seen weird legendary spawn behavior too. I've been farming robots in Watoga lately, and it seems like some servers just have far more legendary enemies spawning than others. Sometimes I can loop around the whole city and not see a single legendary. Other times I've run into multiple groups of 2-3 of various \* levels in a time span of like 10 minutes. Or I'll kill one legendary, and then another legendary will almost immediately spawn from the tubes they come out of. And at least twice now, I've gotten back to where I started and there's a new legendary in the same spot I found one several minutes prior, but the new one will drop no loot at all. I've also run into two legendary robots that were bugged together so it looked like one robot standing still, but I killed it and two bodies dropped to the ground, both with loot.
---
Yeah My base is right outside Morgantown. I have noticed a trend. It is getting nuked more and more. I get to watch the nuke go off usually right at the edge of the blast zone. Its nice having my base so close to a blast zone.
---
That's the point of this thread.  No I don't think it's a joke lol.  Just like f2p used to mean no monthly subscription, and now it means the game is free... Kids misunderstand the meaning and end up redefining words all the time lol
---
just worked out who you are, good afternoon Sir!
---
Lvl 94 here and so far no one has tried griefing my camp yet, knock on wood. Im a big fan of the permanent, homey, show it off for people who stop by kind of camp. It is really satisfying having a place I can really call my own, and when you get bored it's nice to have a place to just relax, play the banjo, and occasionally fire the artillery at the nearby squirrels.
---
Even though Bethesda have acknowledged the glitch and it's apparently a fix in the next patch?
---
It suits my character's roleplay
---
Whereabouts?
---
I made a simular post last night. It sucks. Its a crappy problem and the only way to avoid it happening again is to stash your junk. Just know you're not alone in this as many have had the same thing happen. Wish the disconnects would get figured but until they do stash that junk! I lost over 200lbs of bulk. Was extra and was giving away most of it but like you said it represents time and effort, seeing it just disappear is a little rough. 
---
Yes, that's why you hire guards. Diamond city, megaton, all had guards. It's still the wasteland after all. When you have a Town set up on pc, give me a holler. For some caps, nuka colas, I'll protect your town from anyone. 
---
Hurray for the ability to be anonymously abusive online!
---
Don't shoot the robots otherwise they'll attack you.  Make a bee line for the front door.   If something other than a bot does attack you, run towards the entrance and let the robots take care of it.
---
Yeah sadly my bathroom encourages poor hygiene, unless you want to take a full bath every time. Speaking of which... we need curtains.
---
What perks does it have??
---
Personal attacks? From the guy the called me "idiot" after I called you out
---
I think one of the vendor bots at whitesprings sells it.....blackpowder guy??
---
Doesn't seem like it
---
Everyone and their mother will go back to boring melee.
---
Wasn‚Äôt the scientist outside of Reno in the stables the creator of jet? So how do we have it in 76 when it‚Äôs before in the go timeline ? 
---
If you‚Äôve never played fo2 I highly recommend it. It‚Äôs my favorite game of the series 
---
you get it from events spawning in the mire :-) but it's a low chance
---
Hahahaha!! That‚Äôs hilarious and he must be an American Horror Story fan. 
---
I don't think its possible without a jetpack, some jumps require huge horizontal jumps
---
Well you're making it worse by labeling someone as a duper with ZERO evidence that they are one simply because you dont understand the game. If you dont know what's happening then dont throw accusations like that around please 
---
Just use the stairs with the supports, you can stack them if you place a post on top, a post on top of the first post, and then store the first post. Then you can snap another staircase on top. If you alternate them you can make a 2x1 stairwell and go pretty high. I built a 8 story tower at the ammo plant lol
---
Sutton, most recently. 
---
The dev team is aware of this issue and looking into it further for a fix. 
---
I stopped playing recently because of this. I'm just done! You'll get teams of players taking over map using bobblehead's taking over whole areas of map and attacking anyone who comes in area. Yes TSE are a problem I'm glad they are fixing them shortly, but bobbleheads were the real threat to the game
---
Faster swing..instigating and +1 str..I call her little pokey 
---
Besides the good advice below about white springs, check the Notes section of all vendors.  Different vendors load different plans.   Complete events (especially the powering up the generator power stations and certain other events around the Prison).   Look up interactive maps online that show load locations for plans.  Just know that what ever plan someone found there might be different for you when you go to the same location.
---
&gt;you must of hand a stroke
---
How about you, are you feeling ok?
---
This could be an upgrade for the targeting hud for power armor.
---
[Ha-HAA, Gary!!](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10079)
---
(Not an official Bethesda Link. But definitely my text message alert.)
---
Well, there IS a simple fix : **cap** the max damage ***to players***, unless there are certain conditions: sniper headshot, melee sneak attack, nuke.
---
The less simple solution is to fix the broken damage multiplication you can end up with with "min/max-ers" finding combinations of Perks + conditions which result in attack damage in the ***THOUSANDS***.
---
so  person claims shop, finds me somewhere else on map, tags me and all players can kill me?
---
I tested this out on a deathclaw and it took no damage at all when I blocked its attack using a 50% reflected block weapon. So idk of that effect even works 
---
I don't know if it is either but I don't put past people to defy Fallout 76 physics
---
Stop trying to put things into a bin faster than 1 every 5 seconds cause of the crap interaction of Fo76? Yea.... how about they just fix their broken game?
---
Im selling them
---
I remember in DayZ, it'd take roughly 30-45mins to walk from one end of the map to the other. You would legit have to organize excursions with your team. Make sure you have enough food and supplys for the journey, all just to get a certain resource that you need. When you arrive, you find another group is already at the location. So you devise a plan to kill them and take it all for yourself.  
---
This grind is what makes every unit of scrap valuable, every bullet a rare commodity and every life of your character precious.
---
It's not a moral issue wtf. A lot of gold selling, exploits, etc. comes from third world countries where there's very few ways to make a living. They're providing a service that us lazy westerners are obviously willing to pay for. No. It has nothing to do with immaturity and morals, it's a video game for christ's sake, and one where having an advantage means very little to boot.
---
I'll concede to one of your points though. I'm definitely blaming the store manager for not making things harder to steal. There's a thing in retail called expected or acceptable losses. Bethesda has left that bar high for so long that people were just walking out the front door with high end items and the store manager didn't give a shit. Good analogy.
---
450 dmg is peanuts dude, TSE double barrels do 2500+ dmg without any bobbles and I can tank dozens of these shots now with the explosive perks retuned. You just need to learn how PVP works.
---
Oh, he was, I was just kidding. I let he attack me for almost 10 minutes while I was taking the pictures! =\]\]
---
But It is accceptible for melee, right? Since beta nothing can beat melee in dmg.
---
Since there's enough motorcycles lying around I'm ok with them being static items that can be ridden but not picked up, with as much durability as an average vehicle, takes damage when bumping into or running over things, with a chance to explode.
---
#ur a duper
---
This is less frustrating than once I had bunch bulk junk on my way to trade with someone and died but before I could go back to retrieve dropped loot someone else already took it . It‚Äôs pretty obvious it‚Äôs not some random paper bag with worthless shit someone dropped for stash space .The players in this game makes me sad :$
---
Im selling
---
That why I was trying utilize them at something instead of wasting ammo
---
They might be nerfed but they will still be pretty powerful. I kind of doubt anyone will be willing to give one away. All the luck to you though in your search haha
---
Point well made XD ... though technically, any other player is supposed to be a fellow vault dweller. However, the quality of that particular piece of narrative design can be discussed.
---
No, only the person that claimed the workshop or anyone in their team can do it. A common tactic is to scout the map for claimed workshops. They then look on the map to see where that person is. Once they find you they will start to claim the workshop and then fast travel to a location closest to you. They will then hunt you down and kill you
---
Which *really* points out how wrong the listed fire rate of the Gatling gun is, considering mine has a listed RoF of 500(!!)
---
Neither Tormentor, Enforcer, or One Gun Army require you to be in VATS. Enforcer has 30%, Tormentor 15%, and OGA 12%. I believe it's per pellet/bullet, not per trigger squeeze, so shotguns/auto weapons should be more likely to proc. Can't confirm that last part.
---
And I need a better weapon then, damn. 
---
Nice review, but I have to say that IMHO the negative points outweight the only impressive part about the game - immersive/environmental storytelling.
---
Bethesda did an amazing job there, like in Skyrim, and puts so much effort and love into designing caves, towns, houses and even the rooms inside the houses. But other than that, the game is a big dissapointment to me. Not because of the bugs, which will get fixed sooner or later (by the Unofficial Fallout Patch and private servers). Not because of the awful designed PvEvP system, which is more than broken and hopefully server hopping (between "normal" and "survival" mode) will not implemented - otherwise everyone will farm gear/stimpacks/ammo/bubbleheads in "normal" mode and switch server for a killing feast. Not because of the endless grinding or absence of NPCs (my guess is, that their engine would not support so much NPCs, since there were already restrictions of city sizes or loaded NPCs in Skyrim; so they just cut down NPCs to deliver the game) or even the bad end-game content (farming weekly changing nuke codes to launch nukes to kill high level enemies to get better gear to kill them faster - and hope that the server does not crash when looting)
---
In my opinion the most disapointing thing about the game is the story behind the game itself. The goal of the game should be to rebuild Appalachia, make a new society and survive the aftermath of a nuclear war - together. And what did we get? An empty game world. No one survived, except human players - so doing quests for dead people \[or robots\] is really disapointing. How about repopulating the cities? Oh wait. There is nobody home. How about rebuilding towns? Oh wait...we can only build CAMPs (Note: Other games support zoning, so you can "build" things and after completion you change into the zone, where your house or whatever is finished). CAMPS are very limited and often in contrast to the laws of physics. Why can people build a whole house into the sky, supported by just stairs?! Should this game compete with Fortnite?
---
And then...the endgame...launching nukes. A game with the original idea to REBUILD America delivers another nuclear war as its endgame content?! Call me crazy, but when a game does not fulfill its very own premise, its not a good game.
---
I don't know if I should say that, but maybe I will give Far Cry: New Dawn (also post-apocalyptic with CO-OP) a try, until most of the things are fixed?!
---
Addition: Microtransactions. Ever wondered, why they are called MICROtransactions? Because you should spend a MICRO amount of cash to buy ingame things. But when I buy a game (bought it on sale for about 30 bucks) and I have to spend another 10-20 bucks to buy just ONE (1!!!) skin or whatever, they should be called MACROtransactions. I have nothing against supporting developers via such transactions for a reasonable amount of money like 1-2-5 bucks for sure. But when I have to pay for ONE skin almost half the price as for the game, you should NOT call it MICROtransactions! Yeah, you can earn ingame currency, but then please adjust the cash-prizes. THIS IS NOT FORTNITE (or any other F2P game)! I ALREADY SPENT THE FULL PRICE FOR A GAME, so make microtransactions reasonable!!!
---
It‚Äôs north of Bolton Greens, looks like a normal 2 story house with a large hangar off the side. 
---
To be fair, the method was known since before the patch, just wasn't spread.
---
Gotcha. Your title is backwards.
---
Probably gonna need to craft/scrap a buttload of them for the auto receiver mod but will give it a shot tonight.
---
It's one thing if you can't stop players from playing music over their microphones. But to actively facilitate it seems like a bad idea. I mean, a tangentially related examples is that you can get banned from twitch or youtube for hosting pay per view content (or any content that isn't yours). 
---
Again, a system like this also has massive potential for abuse.
---
I just have a portapotty if that makes you feel any better.
---
Ehhh i guess.
---
If you're not going to a workshop to take it and pvp why wouldn't you have pacifist mode on?
---
It's been suggested and they are aware of it.  A community manager passed it over already.  So hopefully we might get something like it in future.
---
Right, but not being in active pvp combat does reduce the damage you can take until you reciprocate.
---
I found a mask laying on the ground by one of the workbenches at the Overseer‚Äôs Camp when I started out with my second character. It won‚Äôt drop from my inventory now. :)
---
I dont think its happened yet; maybe that is this week? But I dont have one so I cant help either.
---
HOLD UP, YOU SAYING PEOPLE ARE  MISIDENTIFYING EVERYTHING THEY DONT UNDERSTAND AS CHEATING?  AWW HELLLL NAWWW
---
Well PA vs non-PA will pretty much fix itself. In hardcore survival games, staying hidden and not getting spotted is half of the trick. PA may provide better protection but thats the trade-off you make for being easily spotted.
---
People have been encouraging others to put their unwanted items during ghoul farming into that container.
---
Kind of been my thought too as a heavy weapons build. I have 9 perks under strength and 3 under intelligence dedicated to heavy weapons and it still feels underwhelming, especially with non legendaries. For how rare it is to pick up a light machine gun or .50 the category should be a little more powerful.
---
That‚Äôd be awesome! Hopefully, it goes through. I have a cool idea for my base‚Äôs shop.
---
I will send you a FR once I am home from work.
---
I got dropped on PC 5 times last night trying to do Mayor For A Day upload. Figured it was the scorch beast and tons of scorched/robots.
---
Well, you need to reread my post and point out exactly how I labeled someone when I was just asking for clarification, and I didn't even post the name. 
---
As someone with 20 thousand decades in survival games.  I think this game should have more aspects of SWG in it.   :)
---
Yeah, seconding this. No one can steal from your inventory. Most people simply want to see what you have, and may want to trade. Naturally, I don't always agree because I got things to do.
---
They are different servers.
---
Too many toxic people in the community. Hard to trust anybody, really sad honestly
---
Some people, like me, just dont ever use pacifist mode unless we are in a nuke zone. I would say 80% of bounties come from people accidentally shooting something another player owns or stealing something without knowing
---
If we could get Robotics Expert to be the mad scientist version of Wasteland Whisperer that would be awesome. As it stands it tends to be useless with the hack time, the crazy distance you need to be to them for it to work, and the hotkey that overlaps with the trade key.  
---
Furthermore if wasteland whisperer can tame any (non-scorched) animal, why can't we do the same for robots? It seems a bit one sided.
---
Yeah cause getting disconnected should totally be something a player has to plan around
---
I don't think we should trust [Gary...](https://images.popbuzz.com/images/30316?crop=16_9&amp;width=660&amp;relax=1&amp;signature=dCjPRCqQVi6XWtCB4WoLUlS_csQ=)
---
About these Radium Rifles you have squirrelled away fellow weirdo.... 
---
I love mine but not had a single decent ledge drop 
---
I like that. I'd still like to see the health bars when I enter workshop mode though
---
I routinely get up to nine one-star legendaries per golf club run.   And I dump whatever I can‚Äôt sell into a container for someone to find.   
---
I like where your head is at. Although I think not being able to fast travel would slow the game down to much. 
---
Instead, maybe only allow fast travel to train stations, your camp, teammate camps, and 76. Of course people may camp train stations, but that could create fun tension.
---
I would also like to see new legendaries for pvp. Instead of being damage focused they could offer utility. So no TSE, bloodied, etc. Things like increase reload speed and increased movement speed (just as an example). Maybe even make these legendary effects only available in survival. Just my two caps. 
---
I actually think it will attract alot more new players to the game.
---
Equipmonk sharp, equipmonk dirty, equipmonk makes you bobbum hurty.
---
Dying is. And weight management.
---
Yeah, just wanted to point out that this isn't deliberately breaking the game to get more XP or somesuch - it just happens during regular gameplay. To anyone who ever killed a glowing one :P
---
You're choosing to not get the point.   How much time are you going to spend cherry picking when you are being swarmed by mobs?   If you don't loot the corpses then they disappear and you get nothing.  When the game is getting overloaded / overwhelmed by nuke zones and people and mobs battling it out there, the corpses don't last very long.   It's easy to be picky when you aren't in the middle of fighting.    Besides nuke zones, I have wandered into areas where two or three waves of super mutants load and after I kill the first wave a second wave loads in right behind them and then a third after that.   You play the game at your pace, slow and picky.  I'll play the game at my pace, but that means I'll have to deal with inventory a lot more.  Your solution of just not picking anything up doesn't work.  It works for you, then great, but there isn't only one way to play the game, hence the perk system that lets you choose what you need to play the game.  I have tons of weight reduction perks and I have gotten rid of all but 3 weapons and 2 extra pieces of health regeneration armor.  I have gotten rid of most of my aid, and with all of that I am 20 to 30 pounds under weight.  I have perks loaded to reduce my weapons, my aid, my armor weights.  I've done everything I can to make this game playable and it is a pain in the ass to spend so much time on inventory management. I have my ammo down to about 10 to 20 pounds.  (It fluctuates.)   Armor and weapons weigh too damn much, even after perks.   You've said absolutely nothing to refute anything I've said... your overly simplistic answer of being pickier doesn't address the point of the thread or the points I'm making in response to the original post.
---
This is my biggest issue with the game currently. Disconnects are still somewhat routine, and also loading into the game takes AGES. I'm sometimes waiting 3-5 minutes, and almost never less than 1 minute. This makes hopping server to join friends or to search nuke zones or to shop vendors a *huge* chore. Plus it seems like the system cycles me between a small handful of servers, often bouncing me between the same few.
---
Legendary..stuffed animals. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The advantages of being over leveled? ;] 
---
Lol, you've given me hope friend. I guess we'll see what happens
---
Im currently looking to get a refund. I talked to them like a week after I got the code and realized it didnt work. They said they would get back to me, its been like 3+ months and still nothing. Thus I'm trying for a refund.
---
I feel this, and I'm on that end of being scared. Unfortunately the risk of having all my caps taken, my CAMP destroyed, and my woman taken is a little to much risk for me to simply just accept a team invite from a random, as much as I would love for that not to be the case.
---
What do you mean?
---
Source????? 
---
That's what I have in mind, run my X01 with my T60 with CS.
---
I've never heard of that happening myself
---
Nice referencing
---
LOL. Yes Yes it is
---
lol what? that's just ridiculous. im not going back to the shop to defend it. why go after the player?i freely let others take it. with the load times it be claimed by then anyways lol.
---
Man spreading?
---
Source???
---
There's a cabin (think it's Investigator's Cabin) where a BADTFL agent is looking into the Free States. There's a terminal with a bunch of locked entries, and one that you can read. It states that he left the area to continue his investigation and that when the time is right, the other entries will unlock. Seems like DLC material, but no clue where he went or if he'll return. 
---
Yes, I guess so! ahhaahah =]]]
---
And the Fatman. I'm launching a goddang mininuke, it needs to do a substantial amount of damage. Hit a Scorchbeast with a mininuke? Make the Scorchbeast fall out of the air and crash. Hit the Scorchbeast Queen with a mininuke and missiles at the same time? Make her fall out of the air. Make it do a good chunk of damage but at the same time cause physical affects. Whether it's staggering/launching it backwards or making flying ones fall out of the sky
---
Use caps and go buy one ya bum.
---
theres a messenger even that spawns near wacky willys, when you activate it, he will follow the road and run into the only 3 cars on the road, after the 3rd he straight up disappears teleports to the outskirts of grafton so you have to fast travel
---
I think legionaries are still needed for SBQ killing. However if they make it so that you lose your entire inventory when you die, you will no longer see players with absolute god-tier gear and if they do, they could lose it quite easily to some smart tactics from an enemy squad.
---
Look for a TSE double barrel or combat shotgun and a TSE lever gun until the TSE nerf comes then you'll be wanting a good melee build as that will be the Meta again no doubt.
---
While the legendary effect may be related, I think the OP is talking about perks that reduce weapon weight by category.
---
Well that's more what the op is saying.  I'm saying they probably use the word "duper" incorrectly to mean "cheater" and then I drew a comparison to how f2p used to mean no monthly subscription (like how you buy elder scrolls online, but can then play on the server for free) but now a days people use it to mean the game is free (like rumors of fallout 76 becoming free)
---
No people wanted to cry about TSEs.
---
The motorcycle or the jeeps
---
Oh nice, I'll have to give that a shot then lol
---
I think I have a quad radium rifle somewhere.. hmmm
---
I think its a reoccurring quest

SAY WHAAT?

If it had to be one or the other I‚Äôll take story 
---
aw ya beat me to it
---
Is it reduced by a legendary effect, or by the shotgun weight reduction perk?
---
There is no jet in Fallout 76...
---
A much more interesting idea would be to set up some sort of waiting area where players can match make somehow. This way they get sorted into groups and everyone can get credit.
---
There should be a boss that's either a over powered radroach or overpowered bloatfly
---
Workshops are a great source, and they're easy to do. Events are pretty good sources, too, but some events suck or are boring.
---
Every time I log in, I usually go to a power plant, power it up if need be, and then claim the workshop. Besides rewards for powering up the plant and defending the workstation, you can also farm fusion cores for as long as you're online and no one takes your workstation. 
---
The mg42 suffers from both being the most underwhelming in power and the most expensive to supply as the 308 caliber cant be made in the same bulk loads as 5mm and .50cal
---
Make ammo and wear easier to manage would be funner.
---
Thanks for the tip. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt apply to jumps.  Wahhhhhhhh
---
I seem to be out of the loop so I do apologize, but what is this about? Is there a new mode coming to the game?
---
Is this true? 
---
76 is not an economics simulator. There is no human element that plays into cost-of-living/inflation and the related increase in cost of goods made. Also, there is no ever-increasing taxation and all goods prices are fixed.
---
Just as caps magically appear, they also disappear through the cost of travelling, and repairing/replacing items, all of which are designed to degrade. Weapons, armor, food etc.  Whether you spend your time or caps, there are costs.
---
In FO4 there was no condition/degredation, therefore accruing &amp; maintaining wealth was easy. With this game, regardless of how much you accrue, you will eventually spend or use it. Just like no matter how many springs or stimpaks I obtain/make, given enough time they need to be replaced.
---
Personally, if more caps were added to the game, some days I would spend less time grinding for materials and dealing with the costant carry weight/stash annoyances, and actually buy more junk/bulk from vendors as a convenience‚Äî I would actually have time to PLAY the game and not manage inventory.
---
Just to clarify, I've put a lot of thought into this as a victim of the attacks lol. My character in game (only one as of this writing) has so far only initiated pvp 3 times, all 3 of them being accidents early on as I was learning the mechanics and making mistakes. 
---
Anyway. We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one, because in my mind you don't really become a dick until you start doing things no developer  of the game intended for you to be able to do. They intentionally built the  mechanics that allow us to, as an example, kill a player and take his junk. You're no more of a dick for using this to acquire screws from other players than from a wendigo.  
---
Cool story lol.
---
99 cores eh?
---
if you're afraid of the dupers; stay away from the super duper mart
---
If you still keep your junk and recipes when you port over, you can still craft basic items to get you started.
---
They dont do it because they want you out of the way, they do it as a way to get a free kill and easy caps
---
I have loved all the previous Fallout worlds, but this one takes the cake. FO76's game world is on a whole another level to me and worth the price of admission. The wonderful world of Appalachia has made me forget about my other issues. 
---
I think it is because some people dont care about workshops, they jist want to pvp, preferably against soft targets.
---
It's a crime I can only upvote you once. 
---
What does that have to do with Bethesda taking ownership of how unstable there servers and game is?
---
Yep it happens when u run out AP screen flashes won‚Äôt stop also PS4 
---
We can drop the acronym crap, we don't need it for every new feature.
---
Would you be buying them too?? I have a suppressed radium rifle I don‚Äôt want and I‚Äôm on PS4. 
---
Ps. It‚Äôs not legendary anything. But I think it‚Äôs a level 50. 
---
Where did you read that PVE servers would be coming soon?
---
It definitely does. Jump up and down in full Sentinel gear and it's super hard to kill anyone. There are Youtube videos about it if you want to see it in action. 
---
Oh cool I‚Äôm on Xbox btw
---
I mean the lower the prices the more stock I can buy before TSE 6 comes out right?
---
Yes,1000X this... I lost my XM-01 power armor Jet pack mod because of this.  I didn't realize it had been auto scrapped. Just a glitch that hid it from me.  Logged on and off multiple times looking for it to place in my stash only I couldn't find it again. WTH! only to later realize that it was scrapped when I repaired some gear. 
---
I was so pissed by this and the Bethesda customer support cant no reimburse me because they don't have an ingame tool to replace items.  Closed two of my tickets that I opened with nobody being able to help. Just this reply both times.
---
&gt;Greetings,  
---
&gt;Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.  
---
&gt;We are very sorry to hear that some of your items have gone missing. Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items. Rest assured however that the information you have provided has been forwarded over to our developers to review.  
---
blahh blahh
---
&gt;We deeply apologize for any inconvenience or frustration that this causes and we thank you for your understanding.  
---
&gt;Best regards,  
---
&gt;Bethesda Support
---
Sounds like something that would work far better on private servers, and provide endless frustration on public servers.
---
Better question is would they be staring at how pretty the dress is or my hairy ostrich white legs?  
---
So did you ever find out?
---
On fallout 3,4 and NV I listened to the radio all the time.  Having a DJ is very important.
---
Maybe stacked bobbleheads for agility? 
---
If they exist. I ignore most bobbleheads so I have no idea. 
---
Yep, Im the one acting rude and childish. Im definitely the one with the problem here. It cant possibly be you. 
---
sounds good and all but i want more than 1 room shack.   I used to build turrets but ultimately they are not worth the bang for buck.  They take up entirely too much camp budget.
---
As does chameleon and stealth. 
---
Yes, I've taken to dropping a small gift (food, water, ammo) for rabdos as they walk by, on the off chance they may want to group. Gave a guy a power armor arm the other day as his was missing, wound up meeting a great group I've been playing with nightly since.
---
If you want some advice, play the game and keep stupid ass stories to yourself.
---
They said *maybe* aid and other items.
---
Assuming that they're going to have you dropping all your gear is a bit of a leap.
---
Now, I personally would be all for that. It would fit my playstyle very well. But I seriously doubt that's where this mode will end up.
---
Yes there is. Survival servers.
---
Just found out, nevermind 
---
"my son wants sooo badly to have a restaurant, where he can cook for others.  He really only needs three things.  
---
A working fridge (spoilage is too much of an issue for rare ingredients), a way to advertise, and a way to not have the place shredded in under 30 seconds."
---
THIS is the content I'm looking for, as the game stands there isn't much of a reason to interact with other players. Other than pvp and tracking down those willing to trade which can be tedious, and feel unnatural when coming to forums to find servers where people want to trade.
---
Having a mapped icon (passive camp) would be a very fun way to gather those who are looking for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.
---
I've had this bug too on PC
---
Once I started to use a trusty no PA melee build, I started to get more legendaries not just because I deal more damage, it's because I can now easily find stuff I kill or loot while they are falling down.
---
But yep, if dead bodies did have some kind of indicator it'd help a lot.
---
Honestly, I rarely get anything useful from them. The maps usually just stack up in my inventory until I get tired of looking at them and/or bored enough, and then I'll go do them, just to do something.
---
That was actually the game :) 
---
Power Kancho at that. 
---
Not totally true. They go down really easy on the way up on the initial jump. So as they ascend and fall they don‚Äôt take dmg, but they do during the act of jumping.
---
Sentinel amor is not that scary at all. I run two sentinel and three cav pieces, that‚Äôs the way to go.
---
Did that too me as well, but wouldn't let me remove them from frame :( had to scrap them to get them off chassis 
---
Yeah I lost a T-60 blue headlamp to that. 
---
When I first read this my mind registered 'Incinerator' and I had to wonder how many bodies are you piling up?
---
Don't have elsweyr to live\*
---
It does _not_ benefit from Bear Arms.  If it's not affected by Heavy Weapons perks, what makes it a heavy weapon?
---
Yes, i know this.  Just didn‚Äôt know if u claimed a workshop PVP stayed flagged even if not at the work shop. 
---
And getting 1 shotted in pacifist mode with slap damage is still stupid nonetheless.  
---
Yes, ps4. Ends also if I kill the target, but sometimes I can't find the target in a crowd
---
The only problem I see with having other people in the silo that isnt in your team, is fighting over where the nuke is launched. Like let's say your team does majority of the work and waiting for the Launch Prep, the other team steam rolls through the place since it's already done except for the ID part and the Launch Prep. All they have to do is run. Launch Prep is done and guess what? The other team already put in their keycard and code and Nuke Whitesprings when you wanted Fissure Prime
---
Sounds great!
---
Yes they do. Someone made a post explaining how they basically made some really great PA by having max intelligence, legendary armor, bobbleheads, and chems. 
---
I meant 100 of the same type. 
---
Thanks mate
---
Maybe the things you are repairing don‚Äôt require steel, which is the most common reason mods are scrapped...that and ballistic fiber 
---
Community manager [/u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ladydevann) posted in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/akng6m/stop_scrapping_my_power_armour_mods_for_steel/ef6r1xx) (re: the bug where mods get auto-scrapped) that "It is currently *planned* for tomorrow."
---
Thanks I'll take a look
---
Not yet. Check out r/fo76bazaar or r/market76
---
My concern with Fast Travelling is it can be abused to avoid PvP.
---
Imagine you see a player farming inside Whitespring. Must be getting some sick look right? So you and your friends setup positions around every exit of the building.
---
He gets a glimpse of one of you through the window. Fast Travels back to his base. Gone. How lame is that?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9wogg/event_related_cosmetics_reward_list_full/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Here is a spreadsheet link
---
Would the prime receiver also do more damage to other scorched beings like scorched snallygaster or mothman?
---
Yes as long as someone starts to claim the workshop it will flag you for pvp even if you're on the other side of the map. If they start claiming the workshop then pacifist does nothing to protect you, you are automatically in pvp with that person and any other in their team
---
Oh, that is my fault. I thought you meant total. 
---
i invite people to my team so i could just get a free fast travel but most think i‚Äôm a griefer :(
---
I'm down to beat some raiders
---
Can we just get to the point where we atleast acknowledge 95% of all trade on the market 76 sub is duped?
---
I mean this whole "fuck dupers." Mentality is stupid, ive found the people who are the most devoted to it are the ones either benefiting drom it the most or doing it themselves.
---
and hardened damage is +30% of standard iirc
---
lmao
---
True!
---
Hard to blame him for not reading when you didn't read that they are fixing this next patch in the Inside the Vault newsletter.
---
Lolz
---
Could someone dupe some industrial wall lights #4 for me?
---
Would love this change! I have the hardest time finding dead bodies if a car explodes, they just magically vanish from the explosion. 
---
Agreed I keep cycling through my games, even one game I am at 89/90 achievements on and have been grinding for thousands of hours but I still just keep coming back to fallout. I just want to farm and grind the achievements in fallout and get more atoms but the bugs won‚Äôt let me. WHYYY :(/:. I‚Äôm currently going for the read 20 magazines...again, this time I‚Äôm keeping them all in my inventory so I know I‚Äôm doing it right.
---
Maybe they just wanted to fast travel? I do it all the time, im lvl 293 and i have no designs on your camp or your caps lol
---
Lolz! 
---
Does pacifist mode not save you from this?  I got wanted once cause I wanted to see what happened if you shoot at the artillery cannons outside of the poseidon nuclear power plant.  
---
Heya thanks for this comment. This is what I did, and weeks later it's a remarkable improvement. Along with the weight changes (thanks Bethesda), you were right, I wasn't digging into HOW MUCH of each junk I had, and I was making dumb drops like armor and things to keep steel and stuff. 
---
Very nice!  I've seen 3 other types in the wild but never a glowing one.  Of course glowing in the dark seems to defeat the point of being a mothman but maybe he was just feeling extra fabulous
---
&gt; In a lot of cases, the game does show you what is going to be scrapped before you craft something. That is not the case when repairing world items like the uranium extractors or anti-air turrets. It just shows how many of each resource it's going to use, not where they're coming from. 
---
From another user. 
---
Every single time Ive lost mods to sneak scrapping, its not been confirmed because its been done with workshop or CAMP repairs.
---
I‚Äôve yet to toy around with heavy guns, the Gatling is probably the slowest of all automatic heavy guns right? 
---
I wonder what fire rate is on a mini gun. 
---
no! it dropped the radium! I was absolutely pumped until I remembered I was supposed to be helping fight the queen...
---
There are any anti-radioation shower on The Poseidon building ? If i remember correctly i seen something.....am i wrong ?
---
Gonna toss you a message around 4 CST
---
You could always sit and click on the upvote multiple times. The end result is still the same but you might feel better afterwards.
---
Being both red / green and blue / purple colorblind, this is exceptionally challenging for me. If a super mutant dies anywhere but a road or on concrete of some kind I pretty much skip it.
---
That wont stop the bug from scrapping them when you repair CAMP or Workshop items. Thats why its such a problem. 
---

Did this bit of condescension truly improve your day? It came at the expense of someone else who's expressing discomfort at the very least, and while you certainly have managed to label the OP you end up looking like a bully with a pretentious writing style in front of the whole community
---
I'm on xbone and just use the cheap $15 set from walmart. I'm sure ps4 has an equivalent. 
---
Like the baby's the blow up in Dead Space 2
---
I would be interested in reading that post. Closest I saw in researching before I posted was [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8f1ty/intelligence\_and\_crafting\_pa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8f1ty/intelligence_and_crafting_pa/), which basically asks the same question, mentions the pa, but doesn't seem to actually answer the question I'm asking, although it touches on it. Do you have the link by chance?
---
Welp guess I can just not repair stuff 
---
That‚Äôs were mine is. Just south in sight of death claw island using the junk extractor. Hope it was mine you found and enjoyed. Psn: NoHallway
---
I like the system that‚Äôs there now.  If you do something stupid that pisses a lot of people off you get an orbital strike in your house.  Don‚Äôt like getting attached?  Turn on pacifist, leave the server, you don‚Äôt have to stand there and take it.
---
But this doesn't fall under the same category, does it?  You are playing a personal game while listening to your own music and not charging people a fee or even inviting people to view your game session.  It's private.  
---
While it can have potential for abuse, Bethesda wouldn't be at fault.  Does Dodge take a hit if you crash into someone while driving a Dodge Charger?  
---
I‚Äôve temporarily un-bulked my steel (no difference in bulked and un-bulked weight) and I keep steel based mods in my stash while I carry some steel scraps in my inventory. I‚Äôve committed to memory that my steel mods are equal to 10 steel scrap so that so I know when to stop crafting and I keep a mental note of the steel in my inventory so I know how many times it‚Äôs safe to repair the extractors during uranium fever of the S.A.M‚Äôs during surface to air events, until the patch this is the only way to keep them safe. If they are in your stash and all your steel is un-bulked the mods will be used last but atm the priority goes steel scrap, mods, bulked steel. Since I‚Äôve been doing all this the game has left the mods in my stash alone, hope this helps
---
The first time I played someone had their open mic hot.
---
Scared the crap outta me.
---
After they add the known tag, I'll be buying more plans for everything.  I mean yesterday I bought the lever action plans because I don't recall ever seeing it, but apparently I already knew it.  
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that - done that with the shotgun and gatling to glowing ones, and they're half limbed and start walking really slowly.
---
haha :D
---
I have been 1 hit in pacifist mode. Both by myself and in a team. No workshops held, all players have it on beong in white springs.
---
Yup. I dont usually claim workshops but my teammates do.  
---
All i know couple weeks back before this last patch we went to whitesprings on a nuke event and me and another teammate got 1 shotted and other player never went wanted.
---
Personally i cant remember if any of my teammates had a work shop or not, but this new bit of information sheds some light on what had happened that day.    
---
System?
---
I think there is another thing maybe worth mentioning. There were some stability/perfomance issues back, when a lot of robots spawned in Whitespring. This bug was resolved, but it gave us another insight how NPCs could affect server stability and performance.
---
There was already a discussion about the [Creation Engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/4os0fj/clearing_misconceptions_on_netimmerse_gamebryo/) 2 years ago, which highlighted some problems with a hard limit on how many NPCs can be displayed without a massive performance impact. This is connected to the cell-based loading system used by the Creation Engine. I don't know what Bethesda changed during those years. But if there is a hard limit present, it might also be one reason to just exclude NPCs.
---
That is exactly what I am getting at. You articulated it better though! 
---
Ugh I don't even bother with this one anymore.  I don't think i have ever had it actually complete.
---
Sorry, forgot to mention. I'm on PC. 
---
Did you see a level jump? Outside the forest things can get crazy when the enemies scale to a high level player that is nearby.
---
Could also be food /drink/chem buffs as some stack without you realizing it
---
No, sorry.
---
It shouldn't apply at any point other than standing still, as described.  
---
Because reading a newsletter is the same as reading an OP before replying to it.
---
I like the outside. The inside is too... Empty for me personally. There's not a whole lot of good decorative items in this game for the floors which suck
---
I tried to experiment with it and didn‚Äôt see any benefit beyond 20 INT. Link to my video: https://youtu.be/nyMFnX7y_n0
---
I went back and tested, and yes that was the issue. Hard cap at 200. And since you're only getting a percentage of caps back (which seems to be ~25%), you're actually losing out by doing this anyway. Kind of like paying caps to reduce storage space before server reset. Very frustrating, I wonder why in the world they went through all the trouble to design it so differently than previous games? It's not like there's this intricate in-game economy they have to balance...
---
I have around 120, all legit :)
---
But there is jet in prewar safes in fo4
---
Thanks! Links aren't live on Instagram unless you've got 10K followers but I will definitely credit you and point the followers in the right direction. :)
---
Dang if you were Xbox I would‚Äôve gave it for free.
---
In another thread today the community person said the patch was slated for tomorrow but not yet set in stone to where she could announce.
---
And last we heard was player-vending was supposed to be in this patch (not the last ItV but the one before it). 
---
So... probably tomorrow?
---
Early on I joined a Forest event: Wolf hoard. Did it solo while kiting every wolf and spamming heals. I spent 10 minutes searching for the leader's body and couldn't find it at all.
---
It does. Youre suppose to het slap damage vs 1 shot.
---
I agree. Yes there might be a few assholes out there, but they are few and far between. The only time I have been killed when I wasn't planning to PvP was when I accidently shot an extractor when I was helping defend a workshop and got a 10 cap bounty. For me, it's the bounty system that needs reworked. Make it so you only get a bounty for actually breaking something, not just hitting it one time
---
ok, so the spare ones are 2 x 1\* bloodied,  2\* exterminator with 33% hit chance, 3\* instigating with 25% less ap cost and 40% bash damage, 1\* Nocturnal, 1\* Executioner's, 2\* Medic with 10% extra damage whilst aiming and I think I have a 1\* Assassin too.
---
fuk yo pvp balance
---
Kind of odd but yesterday I was attacked by the yellow eye mothman, then about 20 min later the Flatwoods monster appeared at the jack o lantern place and attacked me. Then I ran into the Grafton Monster at Whitesprings. It was an odd server. 
---
Damn, but thanks for asking. Much appreciated! 
---
Not to be crass, but yeah...with shotgun, when she lands, get all up in her guts. Unless you're rocking TSE. LOL
---
You can also get the perk that removes it during the day, but I don‚Äôt remember the level it unlocks at
---
The lure of Whitesping is the layout. You can make a good route through it and the loop has perfect choke points for farming. All the condos around the perimeter are great because they come out and down the stairs, or you can line them up in the road. The golf club you can farm them right in the doorway. In the maintenance area, again farm them in the doorway. Its just simple and a well known pattern for easy loot. 
---
There was a guy who saw my camp. He did the CAMP emote then confused. He was asking if it was my camp, so I gave him a thumbs up and he gave me a thumbs up and a heart. There is ways to tell someone through emotes
---
I'm  good with all this.
---
I do NOT want to start a new character for every "flavor" of server that comes out.  I worked too hard to grind those levels and find all the recipes needed to play the game.
---
I am OK with not bringing the inventory over.  I can find new stuff.
---
I can see why that would become a problem. But what's stopping me from playing copyrighted music on voice chat while roaming the world as it is right now I wonder?
---
Or getting downvoted because their build sucks and they can‚Äôt take the time to look up what items and cards will protect them from tse. 
---
DC‚Äôd from two different queen fights yesterday. 
---
At level 30, you should be able to roam around Ash Heap pretty easily, and Toxic Valley for sure. You can even venture in the Savage Divide a little. 
---
Rose's quest is definitely part of the main quest progression, so do that.
---
Of I accidentally killed someone, and he has thousands of mats, because he is probably a duper, people think I am a duper.
---
I am not. I am a looter
---
That's an interesting point to bring up to Dev's, we do have colorblind players and having color options makes sense. Thanks for bringing that up!
---
yeah I am all about the gauss too. I dont think you will have to wait until 2020 though so much progress has already been made and, 2020 will be the start of the next generation, and i wonder if they will keep working on it, or port it to the new systems. 
---
So when we tame them do they just go to our base or is there a process?
---
Grandma, what big arms you have!
---
well, it's just how I joke with my friends, one plays Fallout: In The Kitchen and learns recipes and cooking stuff etc
---
I cannot decide how I want to read that sentence. 
---
- Don't kill the deathclaw it's my pet "Gary".

- Don't kill the deathclaw it's my pet. ‚Äî Gary
---
I gave the company 2 months to try and fix there mistakes, i made multiple tickets regarding gameplay bugs, issues and even technical. I reported many bugs during the beta which were never addressed and gave as much support as i can for the game. Call me w/e you guys want but my purchase was never justified and i was extrememly unhappy with the end game of fallout76. Yeah i wanted my money back because i felt wronged
---
You could stash your mods in a world container, repair, and then pick them back up. Its the only way. Risky, but not super risky unless you are unstable. I dont crash enough to have to worry about it. 
---
No handouts son 
---
I'm naturally paranoid now  , if I see people headed my way who are high level  I stranger danger the heck on out of there via fast travel (and I double time it if I hear them trying to engage in conversation ) .some people play heroes trying to reclaim west virgina , others play raiders who wish to see the world burn ,  my version of the game is avoiding human contact :p
---
well i cannot log in right now so maybe server maintenance and a patch are underway.
---
I went with the following.  It's probably way more than you want to spend, \~$240, but the cool thing is that you can use the setup with your PS4, PC, XBOX, and use the headset to listen to music (Stereo Reference Headset).  You can select your own headset.  And you can game at night...  
---
* Samson SR850 Semi-Open-Back Studio Reference Headphones  $33
---
* Antlion Audio ModMic 5 Modular Attachable Boom Microphone  $70
---
* ASTRO Gaming MixAmp Pro TR for PS4   $130
---
* Zeskit Braided Nylon 6 Feet Premium Audio Cable - 3.5mm, (Male to Female)  $8
---
There are ways to make this cheaper:
---
* If you have a standard Stereo Headset that you love, then you don't need a new one.  
---
* The ModMic 5 is a nice Mic, but you could go with the original ModMic, \~$25 cheaper but similar features.
---
* You can look for the MixAmp Pro TR on eBay and save \~$50 on a used one.
---
There are much cheaper options, but for me this is the perfect setup:
---
* I get to select a reference stereo headset that fits me and, if it dies or breaks, it's inexpensive to replace.  Most inexpensive gaming headsets are built relatively cheaply and had relatively poor speakers.
---
* It's somewhat future proof and should last at least through the next generation of consoles.
---
* And...  surround sound is nice...  I can pinpoint shots and other sounds...  It's fun running towards shots only to discover that Supermutants are being attacked by a Mega Sloth.... (grin)
---
That's sounds like something A ~~synth~~ duped would say
---
Quick thought - \*Install them, FFS!\*
---
Does PVP prevent you from exchanging gifts? Someone tried to take my workshop, then when I turned up, accepted a team invitation and tried to give me PA but I couldn't access it. And the workshop couldn't decide which of us was the active claimer.
---
I only crash when I use a two shot gargling laser
---
Gotta go fast
---
That's sounds like something A synth duper would say
---
FYI the number of legendaries in Morgantown is pitiful.
---
There's also a distinct lack of different types of flux there.
---
Whitesprings you can get lots of legendary drops AND get every single type of flux in good quantities (except violet).
---
Please only nuke Whitesprings and Prime until they buff OTHER areas to make them more worthwhile.
---
What about making it one of the challenges to "collect" one of each bear? As in, at least have it in your inventory so it'll recognize that you found it?
---
Xbox?
---
I understand whitesprings but why bottom right? 3 scorchbeasts spawn there then add more mobs too it and your screen is blurr3d by scorchbeast effects for 98% of the fight.
---
They do that now. Its not my responsibility to wait for you to go melee something in uranium fever when theres a dozen other mole miners and youre only focused on the glowing 3 star.
---
Fuck that i clear the whole room.
---
And it‚Äôs totally unfair ppl u seeking revenge can just hop server after they killed u 
---
&gt;I'm tired of people wanting to buff weapons that 90% of people already use
---
I have never seen anyone using a Minigun.  It's absolute trash.  Most of the other heavy guns are garbage too.  There should be trade-offs that make you choose one over the other, not how it is now where most weapons in a class are simply not viable options no matter the circumstances.
---
This happens on PS4. Fail safe is to hold the options menu to bring up the map and it‚Äôll pull you out of it. Has only happened when I was in power armor on my VATs crit build character. (Excavator with Targetting HUD)
---
I'm just grabbing some pictures of my full collection, I had to set up a new account to hold some of them for me so it'll take a little while! My dream radium would probably be Anti Armour, Explosive with a vats point reduction, but to be honest, I love them all. Fire rate increase would be great too as it's effectively a DPS boost. Moving faster whilst aiming is also really good. 
---
Actually when i buy a shirt i wear it. But if the shirt wears off all its color after 1 wash yes i will refund that shirt. If the company that sold it to me don't wanna refund my money i simply go to the credit card agency to have it all fixed. Yeah i like shirts but not poorly designed shirts that shrink to rat size after 1 wash
---
So lame. Thanks for reporting back! I kept forgetting to test it myself while playing.
---
I agree it's a frustrating system. There's days when I don't even play at all because I know I need to wait for the vendors to reset to sell my shit!
---
I need to learn to let things go and just toss stuff but that is so hard, lol
---
Yes please :)
---
Also metal versions of the powered doors should be included.  My metal base has an ugly brick door because it's the only option available....lol
---
Guess that makes you the asshat?
---
Just wait until you're able to be disappointed by 4 and 5 star legendaries!
---
I'm just saying, if I'm thinking this, Bethesda is most certainly thinking this. You can't say definitively that this would be legal until something similar goes to court. 
---
This is why youtube had to enact their content enforcement system otherwise they would have lost a $1 Billion dollar lawsuit.
---
Or your just getting worse at the game lol 
---
Glad you brought this up!  We colorblind people often get overlooked. It drives me crazy at work when I hear, "We've color coded the spreadsheet to make it easier for everyone."
---
Just wear lipstick and it wont matter. With so many gender neutral questions being attacked and defended now a days, people usually just glance and look away. But, we are going for staring.. so we have to doll you up some. Just smile and wave and hopefully that will set you up for success. 
---
Some high-level guy wearing a weird inflated head mask followed me around with a misterhandy buzzsaw trying to kill me. He had speed demon &amp; super high jumping so I couldn't escape, I feared for my life.
---
That's OK because i have 0 respect for Bethesda and its community. ES6 and Starfall are the first things on my Cracklist for sure now
---
funny, someone called me a synth this last weekend when I closed out a trade using my second-account mule.  never duped an item in my life...I just use the second account to hold spare junk and semi-decent weapons.  I traded a 2\*\* BE Westerd Revolver - hardly an item that a duper would bother with.  
---
Yeah, sadly I think those days are over. I was trying to get to SBQ on saturday and I couldn't get anyone under 100 to bring me through.  Sighz
---
I shouldn't have to server hop because of one asshole
---
here's me posing and a few of my collection:

You can do a couple events to get a bad ass white outfit. Same style. Reaaaaally low drop chance though
---
Play the game paparazzi 
---
Correct it is.    In this case the newsletter is OP and your post is a reply since B encourages feedback by social media like Reddit.   You probably just made this post for karma anyways after already knowing this bug is being fixed
---
Yeah especially the prime ammo.
---
Thank you SO much for leaving this here.
---
I get this, usually when I am standing on something unusual and using VATS like if I'm perched on a fence or even sometimes it just happens if I'm on a 2nd story of a structure. Doesn't seem to happen if my character is on the ground in the game world. 
---
I'd tune in for that. I would probably be more of a Travis pre "Confidence Man" 
---
This affects PC version too. I had that bug a few times while wearing Excavator power armor without mods. 
---
That's a difficult question to answer, honestly, without asking our legal department. Currently players can mute other players so I'm inclined to think payer controlled radio would be an entirely new legal undertaking. That's stated as a non-lawyer. I can't even begin to imagine the complications and technicalities involved in it.
---
 Aside from the fact that I've never heard another person play music over their mic in any game that didn't sound completely awful. (Ever play in a shooter lobby where someone thinks the entire lobby wants to hear their garbled music over their mic? Insta mute!)
---
I haven't seen any benefit past 20 or so...
---
Safe was cracked by a Jet addict, obvs.
---
Peopleee offff Grrrrrafttttonnnnn, arrrreee youuuu reaaaddddddyyyyy to rock now!
---
I find if that happens, where an enemy that should definitely drop something doesn't drop anything at all, open the transfer window and wait a bit, seems to load up quicker than waiting on the quick loot window.
---
No it doesnt, slap damage applies to everyone. Pacifist mode makes it to where you cant damage other players to accidentally start pvp
---
It's listed under Heavy Weapons in the crafting menu for no reason whatsoever.
---
But definitely benefits from 16-20?
---
I hope. 
---
The sooner pc users get a patch, the sooner we get it on console. 
---
This made my day üòÇ
---
Sweet sweet Travis! I was absolutely delighted when I found that mission!
---
"Jet" existed before the war, as a military drug for enhancing performance.
---
After the war, the infrastructure and manufacturing base for producing jet disappeared.
---
Then a jerk in California discovered a way to produce jet post war with brahman dung... in the process making it more addictive. 
---
And, apparently, the raw ingredients are in Sugar Bombs, something that surprises me not at all.
---
i always thought it was a pc issuse since my key board derps out at times 
---
I‚Äôd say enter the Mire from north, either cutting through the Savage Divide from the Toxic Valley, or just moving through the Divide from south to north (harder). Use each bunker in the Mire as a retreat point if you‚Äôre chased by big and nasty things, and for scrapping (most have workshops, some don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt recall which had what). Use Red Rocket stations along the highway for STASH access.
---
The person who initiates the security lock down should have priority to launch (first one in the silo) but if someone comes in to help there should be like a thirty second lockout window and then anyone can launch. 
---
I helped a person clear a bunker and they just sat in the goggles for five minutes or so till I left and I didn‚Äôt get the completion reward. Not a huge deal for me since I can solo silos in or out of power armor, but still.
---
The reward once per week (Day? Can‚Äôt remember.) is atrocious though. 
---
I see below that it was likely a glitch.
---
Now you've got me wondering if I have Cola flavored gum.... (grin)
---
Will watch asap. Looking to learn whether there is benefit for INT from 16-20, which from context seems to be the case...
---
Yeah, i heard that it is obtainable through an even (although i don't know which one/s) and eventually i will get that one too, but i'm more into the darker colors ;-)
---
So... you are spam posting this topic... and are mad he is spam commenting his topic in you spam posts?
---
I interesting
---
Maybe by The Ink Spots
---
Y... yellow eyes? Really? I had no idea! How many are there???
---
I would love this. Took down a scorchbeast last night, then took care of his friends on the ground, but couldn‚Äôt find the SB to loot it after. You know what‚Äôs worth than the subpar loot you get from SB‚Äôs? Getting nothing. 
---
I dont understand all the people crying out at the suggestion that the hazmat could become a simple cosmetic overarmor. What would be so unfair about that? You get the exact same thing and more in your stupid PA just drooling around. God forbid we make the life of non-PA wearers a bit more comfortable, whats with already having to spend a buttload of perks to be remotely viable...
---
Its still F2P. Terminology is going at evolve as some things, such as free games with micro transactions, become more mainstream. That and most games I know off that are free have a subscription available anyway. 
---
It's not supposed to and I dont know how it would work if they start to claim it and you join their team. But dropping power armor they have to actually drop it, not just set it down. 2 different things even tho they look the same
---
Looking at them now, these are *glow*\-rious!
---
I mean, paranoia would be justified if dupers tried to secretly infiltrate the regular player base. Those are real synths. Fortunately, most dupers don't care and you can see their thousands of duped items while trading with them. 
---
Appreciate the input! Any info is welcome.
---
Prolly leaves the cap of the toothpaste too. 
---
A high level player might have arrived before you, causing higher level enemies to spawn.
---
Or if somebody nuked the area, that'd also make it very high level for a while even after the radiation is gone. I saw someone nuke the Charleston capitol building yesterday, not sure why.
---
OP is a synth he‚Äôs trying diversionary tactics to place suspicion on duper‚Äôs!
---
All joking aside i like this idea
---
Affects PS4 as well. Can't remember the mods I'm running in my PA off the top of my head though. 
---
Ok so if you attack me to intitate PVP when i have pacifist on, own no workshops, have no bounty and you 1 shot me
---
Hows that explained 
---
Pshaw killed the queen yesterday no weapon only plans and flux...
---
Big Bend Tunnel (from Watoga to the ash heap so you can sell) and west tek are good enough for me.
---
Seems like it but I'll confirm when I get off work tonight. I'll say that it's pretty minor past 15, if at all, I just habitually buff up before repairing. I sit at a flat 15 without any additional buffs, so I'll see if there is any noticeable increase
---
3 other types? I know about the regular "red eyes" and the wise "purple eyes". Are there more?
---
I wont risk my main getting bombed i know this community very well, they are upset there game is a failure and will do anything to anyone that points outs facts about this game being a huge bust. There is no recovery for this game if they did Bethesda would have to hard wipe every character because you got people running around to 100k plus shotguns now and weapons from the dev room that are unreleased.
---
Nuke it with fire
---
 The better to shoot these flying fucks with, my dear 
---
Sure, OK
---
That would be a duper with a shit ton of bobbleheads. I'm not talking about that tho, I'm talking about the mechanics under normal circumstances
---
oh wow, that's really kind of you to offer! I have learned all the mods now and i have quite the collection of legendaries so I wouldn't have much use for that one, i'm afraid. Maybe you could start your own journey? Only joking, only a madman would do that...
---
Awesome! Any updates are much appreciated.
---
I love love love increased movement speed while aiming. Personally I use melee so anytime I find a bleeding mod I get so excited.
---
I know.  Fallout 4 also takes place 50 years after Fallout 2, and in that time, the Brotherhood of Steel crossed the country from where they originated in the Mariposa Military Research Facility in California.  One could easily argue that those same people brought their California vices with them.
---
...but the question is why Jet exists as-is in Fallout 76, set 55 years before the *first* Fallout game.  Either Myron stumbled onto a 135 year old recipe, or Bethesda retconned the concept for their prequel.  Considering how many other things from later in the timeline (like Enclave armors), I‚Äôm inclined to think it‚Äôs a retcon.
---
glorious! that's the one thing the Radium is missing in my opinion, a drum mag
---
Did you really downvote my post...what are you fucking 12?
---
Happens to me on Xbox too. Only in power armor though, so I usually step out of the PA and it goes away.
---
I'm on PS4 with Excavator Power Armor.  This has happened to me about 4 times.  Usually when I'm fighting a SB or a big swarm of higher lvl enemies.  It'll go away after a minute or 2.  
---
I was really hoping you were gonna say never change 
---
This is a great idea! I'll pass that along!
---
Yes that is what I found. The ballistic damage resistance and condition will increase up to 20 max. Above that I saw no difference. Some people have said you can just 200% repair armor and get the same result but I don‚Äôt think that is true and repairing will not change the condition. The condition is set by INT when crafting or luck when finding it.
---
Also on xbox here. It does seem to happen more often when I'm in PA, but I haven't been running any mods on it.
---
You probably were not actually in the event, there's been times I've gone to events and not joined I'd have to open the map and then select the event and fast travel into it.
---
So, are you still a virgin?
---
Are you 12 for getting offended? You tried to state false information as if it were fact, therefore,  down vote 
---
I had none and then I had loads, it's really weird how they seem to like living in groups! When I had the TSE drop in the golf club, I nearly wept haha
---
And, apparently, a Radrat has already broken it.
---
Reminds me of Dead Leaves
---
Buck-a-roo we all do
---
Get her a gamepad is PC controls are turning out to be fiddly. Fallout plays great on a controller, and I personally prefer a gamepad for Fallout, as do many other pc players.
---
You can make almost any build work, the only thing builds do in this game is determine how much ammo you use or how many swings it takes. 
---
Iv'e seen groups of level 11-30's in nothing but hazmat suits take out level 80+ players simply because they can gang up on them. (4 v 2)
---
these are players that dont have the right cards and are squeeking into the mic  in the same party chat as me. 
---
When Everyone ISNT CHEATING its a pretty fair fight even if one person is decked out in full power armor and all that fun stuff versus a group of lower level players that need help and only have crafted non legendary gear 
---
I came across a guy in his underwear in the whitesprings bunker last night who kept punching me while I was using a terminal and asking me to trade or join a party.  Wonder if it was the same guy...?  Was on PS4.
---
That's a good idea I mostly  play alone so I didn't even know you could message the whole server. I'll be sure to do that next time.
---
I've had this happen many times myself too, and I'm running a no power armor pistol (vats) build. Most commonly occurs in 'target rich' environments when I'm switching VATS targets. I am always in a group too (in case that if of any impact to root cause analysis).
---
1. That is good news. I am interested in craft at max condition.
---
2. Now I have to respec my build OR figure out a viable mix of INT buffs. :)
---
Like 3.5k caps
---
This is the best suggestion for SM so far. These are not just good ideas but necessary mechanics THAT NEED TO BE SET IN PLACE BEFORE LAUNCH
---
yerp, if i ever have to boost out my rads for bloodied or unyielding I can just shoot the floor until my rads get super high haha
---
Bit of an odd request but don't have a Junkies one for sale do you? If it has +25% fire rate too I'll pay good bucks! 
---
You've inspired me to take this quest upon my Psychobuff/jet addicted alt lol
---
Been looking for this as well. I spent a couple hours server hopping and got the witch but she didn‚Äôt have plans for the dress. Also got a male vampire once too. Both trick or treaters had a holotape advertising the pumpkin house and some cotton candy bites. The search continues....
---
Same. I started off collecting all Bobbles and Mags, in hopes to display them eventually. Needed to alleviate some space, so i started using the Bobbles i need towards the 'use different bobbles', and once theres 20 mags in my stash, thats when ill start those.
---
TS doesn't work with VATS in general.
---
OMG Yes
---
So far I've run into stalking mothman (red eyes), vengeful mothman (red eyes), and wise mothman (purple eyes).  Not sure if stalking or vengeful really differ much since both tried to scream jump me to death with no warning, but I assume the name has some sort of meaning.
---
I replied to another person a little while ago with the radiums I think I have in my collection. Check them out!
---
Yes pacifist mode does protect you from that but what fun is that it doesn't happen that often. Someone came and found me while I was eating breakfast so it all worked out.
---
sure its not because the pvp system feels slapped on and has no rewards and only cunts really use it? and dont you say caps cause ive been hovering a thousand caps below the limit for months
---
When you see a random bandwagon, you jump on it. 
---
This is the problem , the dude the in clown outfit the can 1 shot me at a workbench and when i hit him with my super sledge he takes 75% damage so i know he has nothing equipped. 
---
Im in full powerarmor that is 200% repaired and i get 1 shot death, i get one kill on him and he comes back and one shots me with a tse every time... instant death with no chance to res. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what the future can hold. With how venomous the reviews were, they might not port the game to another console. Unless it‚Äôs all backlogged and we pay for a service like the PlayStation Now were it‚Äôs all streamed to our console. Without drastic additions to the world play or some form of gameplay, I don‚Äôt know how long this game will hold my interest. 
---
Happens to me on PC off and on outside of power armor. My main character is a non power armor setup.
---
not OP, but this has been happening to me the last couple days.  
---
PC. 
---
it flashes in and out of vats (faster then you can see the interface even).  ap meter goes to zero, can't open my pipboy or anything till it chills out.
---
Charisma's got a couple alcohol boosting perks
---
Cool deal. How does the radium rifle perform at high levels?
---
I scrapped 2 t60 calibrated shocks, and learned my lesson since. When repairing I always look to see the sources of the repair, if it says something other than steel, I cancel and reexamine my inventory. 
---
A joke about Little Rad Riding Hood\*

Tbh I actually preferred awkward Travis lol! Do you know if he was based off [this](https://youtu.be/W45DRy7M1no) dude? BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
---
I'm PC sadly, but keep up the good work! 
---
Yea.. I think a true test would be off an actual player with armor penetration.
---
The link to my post about it is below. I mention some of the buffs in there.

Eh, its good enough with my Bloodied Grognak, i have to use a female character cause it really shines with that outfit. 
---
unless they're changing areas monsters in the forest will still be weak as shit with some decent resources in the area.
---
But after dying you get a chance to retrive your stuff. After a dc no such luck. Thats what op is upset about. And rightly so
---
During the events where you have to guard those turrets (surface to air?), the enemies that attack the turret spawn inside of it.
---
You posted that just as I got a trick or treater. I got very excited when I saw a body dressed in black. And then sadness.

I feel like this is more rare than the long coat vendor. That didn‚Äôt take me too long.

Next thing you're going to expect people to stop calling everyone that puts turrets next to the Whitespring Golf Club a griefer.
---
Missile turrets are indeed amazing. Although they do take up ALOT of budget. They should just cap the # of turrets you can put in your C.A.M.P instead of making them huge budget. I'm pretty sure the reason they made them huge budget is because they don't want people creating a building thats made of turrets, which would cause huge lag for anyone that comes within range of them.

have you ever had dick heads blasting their music in cod lobbies you dont see them  getting copyright striked but idk

Maybe, but I know a level 91 glowing deathclaw packs one hell of a punch, so blocking and reflecting one of those should show some results. Unfortunately it didn't

yo what the fuck this post is like 3 months old
---
What roof exactly
---
Interesting. I guess it looted it off a crowned enemy then. Well, congrats, I have had the radium rifle plan for ages but never got a good enough drop to consider using it. I doubt I have more than a few mods for it too. 
---
I spam this topic because everyone who actually exploits it shoots it down. It‚Äôs an actual fucking problem on the servers and yet the only post that seems to even do remotely ok is a month old and is constantly being downvoted. 
---
I understand that. But the prior commenter also rightly pointed out that going that long without going to a stash is generally unwise for multiple reasons.
---
This ever get fixed for you?   
---
I did a maze and well when I moved it it auto scrapped everything and left me with 100% budget and no items, not in stored not in blueprints not in anything. I did get all the junk which put my stash way way over, I since pulled it all out dropped it and put it all back in and nothing till. 
---
I really wish that gun did more dmg. With perks n such I mean it doesnt break 300
---
Sometimes I just follow people around with chameleon armor. Sometimes I shoot at things around them. The confused reactions are worth it.

aha! You're a melee (Lady)Bro! Love watching you guys going to work on the queen, you bunch of overly intelligent (for the perks) meatheads!

My team mate is a hardcore powerfist guy, we often go to Sons of Dane Compound for the event and I just hide in the corner and watch him fist-fighting the ghouls, it's so entertaining!
---
You're being paranoid. There is a challenge this week to complete 10 quests in a team. Also as a solo player, psa, if you have a team invite pending and finish a quest it still gives you credit for being in a team. Grinded out 3 quests this way by doing fertile soil, sending requests to people and finishing the quest at the terminal before they could decline. Not everyone out there is out it get you, it's just a game.
---
yes
---
Quad Explosive pump action, good range with 32 rounds and pretty much 1 hit kill most 
---
I‚Äôve got one. How much you offering
---
Yes we need them.  With a large map and yet only a limited number of players per server it just feels so incredibly empty.  And they do have npcs they just decided to make them all robots.  
---
You know what, I don't think I do. If I find one, I'll let you know!
---
It only takes 10-15% of the budget. I have a 2 room 2 story, with one turret and a ton of crops and I still have 30% left. I used to run 4 laser turrets, but only have the one missle turret now. I need to move it higher though, but it does well for just one.
---
It really depends on how you react to them.  People like that want to get a reaction out of you.  If deprive them of what they want, it isn't as much fun for them.  Showing them that they aren't getting to you is the challenge.
---
Yes,  same feeling of disappointment! Haha I‚Äôve been looking for that vendor too since some have said they bought the dress from him! Best of luck on your search! 
---
If you have zero respect then don't post in the community. Also don't hide behind anonymity; at least be open and honest if you are going to fraudulently request a refund.
---
This post is an example of everything that is wrong with the world currently - there is way too many people who feel entitled, lack basic human decency or an moral fibre. 
---
For the record, I don't care if you don't like the game, you can hate Bethesda etc as much as you like - go and protest outside their offices if you want...if you feel that is justified then fine; I simply take issue with dishonest people who play the system because they are butthurt - dispite, in your case, spending 200 hours playing the game...if you were that disappointed you wouldn't have sunk the hours into the game to begin with
---
This seems....excessive.
---
what are you playing on? I might just give it away as I don't use it. gotta check I just threw out a bunch of guns recently
---
That's some creative use of half and slanted wall pieces - very nicely done!
---
Hate these events.
---
Totally agree.  I am on PC, so I added the Known Plans mod recently.  It helps a ton.  I'll be glad when they add it to the game itself.
---
Yes,  same feeling of disappointment! I‚Äôve been looking for that vendor too since some have said they bought the dress from him! Best of luck on your search! 
---
I farmed that bridge forever and never seen  a lone dclaw lvl 91.only 21. The lvl 91 was the event with the traveling merchant. 
---
Was it scorched when you tamed it?
---
You have it so it's proven,but i never heard of anything like that spawning there.
---
S.H.O.P.S.= Seriously Heavily Over Priced Stuff
---
That would certainly explain it.  Wish it was marked as such.  It made me think the quest was bugged.  Other people I play with haven't mentioned seeing that quest come up again.  Maybe they're just laughing at me commenting on the quest being bugged and they know better.  ;/

They've acknowledged the issue where mods are scrapped before bulked junk and are fixing that in the next patch. I've never heard of mods being scrapped before raw components as you're claiming here.
---
But if you have a link to what you're claiming I would be interested in reading it.
---
I duped last night. That's right, sue me.
---
Only had 1 Assaultron Circuit Board, but I wanted both the Sentry Bot helmet and the Eyebot one, so I used Super duper to make Assaultron Blades to dupe the circuit board.
---
Made sure to let the NSA agent listening to my discord know that my duping was kosher, though.
---
Perhaps the NPCs show up on servers dedicated to players who have finished the main story quest?
---
Heck, this almost sounds like good end-game DLC. New NPC survivors start rolling in and it creates a whole new narrative to follow as you help them get established.
---
The only issue I can see with this idea is their server situation is already rocky, but perhaps down the road this may be something to consider.
---
Haha! I am not sure if he is or not, I was a fan and not an employee when Fallout 4 came out. I'll have to ask, that really is spot on!
---
Nope. PC.
---
PERFECT
---
"Technically" there is, you can find jet and the plans for it in the dev room
---
But yeah canonically it shouldn't really be there and it's most likely just a carryover from fo4. I don't think I saw ultrajet but I may be wrong
---
Hell no!   Don't do that to her!   Controllers are like playing with mittens, no fine control or options at all!  Stay K&amp;M, and since you built her a gaming PC, I presume you got her a good K&amp;M setup, ergo and multibutton programmable mouse?  Never switch out!
---
So this is the end game content they promised? I don't think I am ready to install yet, again.
---
Xbox One X, I've had this happen quite a few times and every time has been outside of Power Armour
---
The vendors might give you 48 caps if your lucky 
---
I honestly think this is why Bethesda is having so many issues fixing stuff. Almost all of there other games are literally fixed by mods created by other players and they can't rely on that for this game. They aren't sure how to actually "fix" things and instead are just repeatedly creating "band aids"
---
Thanks Srgt P. Ugh, I think my benefactor must have set it down by accident, because he did then fix all my turrets before disappearing.
---
pfft, more like 25
---
They go back to your base after enough time has passed.
---
&gt;playing with mittens
---
Um. No. But ok.
---
Haha thanks, I‚Äôm on PC and I‚Äôve got a pretty large stash of Ultracite actually. Aside from a weird stock on it, I think I have the mods I‚Äôd want. Unless recon scopes are unlockable...

Ikr? Scrubs with tse have ruined our reps as high lvls üòÇüòÇ

For those players who are deaf or hard of hearing, any sort of visual indicator would be immensely helpful on Percepti-bobble and Pannapictagraphist.

You're right, people playing music in their mics sounds absolutely terrible, (I wonder why?ü§î) but perhaps people could choose music from the already existing library?

I like a chewy, dried out bit of toothpaste, if that's wrong I don't want to be right. 
---
This has been happening to me randomly as well, mostly while wearing power armor.
---
Luckily it doesn't happen too frequently. It finally stops when the mob I was targeting is dead.
---
If you want to use your X01 just stick T60 legs with Calibrated Shocks onto it - you have yourself a hybrid X01 and unless people look closely enough they'll just assume its X01.  That's what I ran for a while.
---
Must be nice, I mostly get attacked,
---
Wearing the transformer power armor is no longer enough.
---
This is your ULTIMATE FORM
---
Thank you! 
---
I'm excited. 
---
Yeah it is, I'm 95% sure that the Gatling fire rate is just displayed with an extra 0. It feels like it fires at about 50, not 500.
---
Granted, Martial artist perk increases Gatling gun fire rate for no reason whatsoever, so... Who the hell knows.
---
Haha brilliant! Thanks! I really wish I had stayed but as I wasn't sure what the stakes or rules were I didn't want to frustrate the situation further as it already felt pretty hostile and it all start to kick off. 
---
My gf just found one too. an old favorite from 4
---
In PVE (which is all I‚Äôm talking about) higher stealth makes it easier to stay in stealth and get sneak attacks on scorchbeasts/queen. 
---
It is! I wanted to do a laser gatling build but since they're bad i'm probably gonna sell half of them.
---
This is great. They could use the houses you can't explore as the foundations for some of them.
---
I do this with the supply drop holotapes but I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a patch out to fix these though. It said something about the supply drop holotapes in the patch notes 
---
Just a heads up, your "source" link is bad..
---
Thanks Radium Jesus! Just keep me posted I have the caps :)
---
I just looked and it seems that only has one scope mod for a long scope, i'm afraid.
---
What would imagine for that visual? Like the damage indicator but smaller and a different color? I agree that would be helpful as well.
---
There's one associated with this very sub, you just have to move your eyes slightly to the right ---&gt;
---
I was so excited to see them that I didn't even notice the names!!! =\]
---
I'm not slow and picky. I'm fast and picky. Maybe you should reduce the dose of whatever stimulants you are taking because that wall of text doesn't really make much sense.
---
Shops we need I am tired of trying to trade with the current trading system. And display cases I want back into the game and also the removal of paper bags instead of doing a paper bag you can choose to do it. 
---
That definitely sounds fishy. I will say, I did have contact with a legit farming cartel on PS4, lol. I had taken a workshop, and after a few runs collecting from it, two high levels showed up. They didn't attack me...but they did let me know they would take over the workshop unless I worked with them that session. I thought, hey, why not? This game is about experience. So they let me know their deal: they get a cut of everything the workshop produces. In exchange, they help me out in getting through quests and events. If I'm available during a nuke run, I come in to the nuke zone with them, tag enemies from a sniper spot, and they kill them. They had a good number of other lowbies there too. This helped everyone gain XP, and of course everyone gets to loot. After the nuke run, they get to look at the inventories, and get to choose 20% of whatever you picked up. Or, you could keep one to two really good items, and they get the rest. To their credit, these guys were legit to their word. They helped me run Poseidon my first time and got me the security credentials to make running it again easier. They taught me the strategy for doing so solo and quickly. They helped protect the workshop when it was being attacked, they took only what the said they would, and at the end gave me a nice piece of legendary armour for my troubles. If they happen to be on the same server I am, I have no problem working with them again. 
---
Yup lets put all the blame on the player and not the bug in the game. That seems reasonable
---
Would you mind sharing your playlist? Thanks :)
---
Yeah, and it lasts until thew enemy that I was targeting dies. Really sucked when it happened against the SBQ once. I've had it both in my power armor and out, PS4.
---
I'd love it to do more damage too, mainly to shut up the handmade bros, but let's be honest, 300 damage per shot is pretty devastating! And don't forget the adrenaline perk...
---
If the power armor disappeared on it's own after 60 seconds without anyone taking it then they set it down and didnt actually drop it. If it stayed there then they dropped it
---
Yeah. I actually broke two on an SBQ fight when I‚Äôd broken my Gatling guns(I have two but both were very low durability at the start) and run out of 50cal ammo, and I run 5* gunsmith and luck of the draw. The gatlings started at 100%.
---
It was also damn near a 30 minute fight.
---
No problem, if my derp can keep others from having a derp, then tis a good derp
---
When you say them do you mean Amazon or Bethesda? Also I found out my issue. Amazon sent an EU copy of the game even though it was from Amazon Canada. You can tell it's the EU version because it'll be rated 18+ instead of rated M like the NA version should be. That being said you should be able to claim the code using a VPN to make your location look like United Kingdom. Hope this helps you and anyone else experiencing this 
---
Is the damage inflated because of perks, or is that it‚Äôs natural damage?
---
I'm a duper. I got the [Super Duper perk.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/72/Super_Duper.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20181203231113)
---
I don't think we need human NPCs. Other people have said that the lack of them make the world feel empty.  Well, I believe that's kind of the point.  This early in the apocalypse the wastelands *should* be devoid of other people.  The bombs and radioactivity would have killed off a lot of people to begin with.  Any left would be trying to eek out an existence in a changed world where *everything* wants to kill you.  And these weren't the "best and brightest" who were stored away in vaults. They would have been just average people trying to survive without consistent access to food, clean water, or medical care. Everyone else being dead makes total sense to me and adds to the immersive quality of the game.
---
Plans from defending the workshop. Only thing that workshops are good for to me. If there is an open workshop, I go take it and do the first defend event. After that anyone can have it because I got what I wanted. Otherwise I just fast travel to the defend events. Hell, sometimes Im the only one there. 
---
"Destroyer of C.A.M.P. budgets"
---
I saw Graham on the tracks across the bridge north of Charleston Station, east side of the river
---
Yeah, possibly. My money would be on the honey beasts or megasloths, they drop the tasty guns IME
---
That stupid f-ing machine took my piece of chameleon armor right off my body.  The name showed up in the list as I was putting quest stuff into that hopper.
---
I don‚Äôt fully understand how this works. I got rank 1 Wasteland Whisperer and can briefly pacify some enemies sometimes. Most times I don‚Äôt even get an option to pacify. I read about getting a deathclaw or other big beastie, taming it, and having it at your base, so got rank 3 of animal friend. I hit random encounter locations this weekend, found an alpha deathclaw, put on those cards, then had a prompt to pacify. Actually, I had two prompts. The x button to pacify, as well as the y button to also pacify. I tapped one of them, Mr big bad deathclaw became white instead of red, I walked up to him to have a look, and he turned back to red and tried to end me. 
---
Any tips here?
---
Someones obviously never lost their sense of taste due to over consumption of cocaine and had to start having someone blow it up their ass with a straw. Just sayin. 
---
This may be a reduntant comment, if so please disregard, but have you tried scrapping everything and rebuilding? Im lvl 293 and i built my camp at about lvl 100, not moved until recently and all my friends camps are like little palaces........mine was like a garage with my budget full lol. After scrapping all and rebuilding, i have the same amount of turrets (2 rocket 2 shotgun) and now i have a much larger base, even has a second floor and everything üòÇ, and i still have everything i could build before plus two more water purifiers and twice as many crops with a little budget left over.
---
But at least any empty beer bottles you've been carrying are safe!
---
Oh man that sounds really cool! I like the idea that it could need rare materials to make. I know we've mentioned this to the Dev's before but I'll mention it again for the future!
---
297lbs of fusion core. Lmao.
---
MOSTLY AGREE!
---
...until you raise prices and competition comes back.
---
76 isnt the real world.  In the real world, if you price dump steel, then steel infrastructure crumbles.  When you raise the price again, theres so many restarting costs that it's easier to just buy the inflated resource than risk the capital.
---
In 76, "restarting" competition just requires going out and collecting thing tin cans again.  There are no externalities caused by shutting down competition.
---
In the real world you either need George Soros or Koch Bros or Chinese Peoples Party or Standard Oil levels of money to collapse markets, and then it's yours because you can always drop prices again to punish people.  Or you need government intervention with regulation and price controls that make it impossible for competition to even get started.  None of this exists in 76 
---
750 caps ?
---
It's not worth that much, 2 shot and explosive are about to both get a nerf so I would say 2k max. It's a heavy which is good but it's an energy which they all suck right now. Do not pay over 2k
---
There isn't room for debate here lol. Simple matter is gathering junk for 2 hours and not doing such a simple act of storing it shouldn't be blamed on anybody but the player. 
---
Pretty sure it went poof just before its owner did, which carries out the setting down theory. A shame because it seemed to be well kitted out.
---
the vendor at the whitespring resort always has it, but he never has the complete set..u need to server hop..i forget the name but all he sells his armor
---
I‚Äôll have to make a normal 50cal and Prime it and compare, but it certainly felt like it was doing a ton more damage than I expected. 
---
And yeah, the queen has way too much health for anything other than MASSIVE DAMAGE to be noticeable, and crossbows do decent per-shot damage but their DPS is horrible, not good for extended fights. Just fun stealth oneshotting regular mobs. 
---
You didn't keep me from derping, but let me know what the derp was, and fix it. If already derped, unfortunately. üòÇ
---
I wasn't getting hit as far as I know.  I cleared the area first.  If I was getting damage from a disease...then maybe, but I'm still not certain that is the only way for the inventory filter to momentarily get screwed up and pull something else in.
---
I had a concept written down. Basically the event would be called Turf Wars and it involves attacking/defending towns and eventually fighting over Watoga for the endless potential responder or raider robot army. Winner gets CAMP related stuff and Watoga's robots would change appearance depending on who won.
---
Yeah. Sucks it wont fix shit. Oh well. Atleast we wont scrap mods anymore
---
*disconnects 45 fucking times a day*

Please do, that clip have me in tears every time!

Resident Evil shinies. (A small ‚ÄúGlint‚Äù. Only when the card is equipped.)
---
I'm using the "batteries included perk which reduces core weight to 10%. Also carring 80 plasma cores ;)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was from there, I got the fatigues and the BoS lab coat at the same time there
---
What kind was it? I have my ultracite armor that I'll never use since I use x01. If you're on xbox I'll sell if to you. What level are you?
---
&gt; fallout76
---
That random hit is usually disease damage, though there are other things that can damage you (traps, firecracker plants that you'd probably hear popping) and possibly other environmental things.    For me, usually the random hit out of nowhere is from ongoing disease damage and stops as soon as I take a disease cure.
---
Thank you! Wish me luck 
---
They should just make the repair cost 40 caps with a timer
---
Blah. Well thanks for checking! I guess I‚Äôm good. 
---
It is supposed to be unpleasantly empty. It's only 25 years after the world was destroyed and we are the ones who are supposed to rebuild and repopulate.
---
The guy I met in Harper's Ferry who communicated in nothing but Waluigi soundclips played over his mic.
---
WAH on, my friend, WAH on.
---
I guess he is unkillable then.
---
Or make it a perception skill, where enemy corpses are highlighted the color of your pip-boy... or something.
---
Legendary effect. I‚Äôll take the mods off when I get home and she what it weighs. 
---
I personally prefer the code, makes it more private. I'd imagine the lasers would just let anybody on your team through. My house is set up that downstairs is for everybody and upstairs is mine. I can give the code to my friends (or just leave the door open), but some random that just joined my party for trading needs my permission to go upstairs.
---
Doesn't make a big deal, but kinda helps with the little RPing I do.
---
haha, i'm not sure if i can but i'm sure i'll know someone who would. I'm all set for disco lights actually, my team mate lives in a train car he's decked out with mirror balls and nuka cola memorabilia so i can always visit him if i need to boogy. I love explosive shotguns, somehow I've had 3 drop for me, 2 combats and a pump. I still use the lowest level one, a 3* suppressor's with explosive and reduced weight and it is just so useful for those moments when everything needs to die! It's only a side arm so I don't have the usual shotgun blues of hunting plastic to make shells!
---
OTEC must have been after my time.  Also, I never really cared out high end stuff, I was always a care bear after I got screwed by a string of shady corps.
---
One of the things I do like about EvE is that stuff like this is technically possible.  It just requires levels of collusion nearly impossible anywhere else, and only possible because the EvE galaxy is one consistent universe, not a shared multiverse like 76.
---
Still an amazing thing to TIL.
---
... why the hell would you want a 4*? The only 4* for snipers basically makes it a worse gun. 
---
Legendary effect. I‚Äôll take the mods off when I get home and see what it weighs. 
---
Yes, I need to put things in the hopper like a geriatric old lady because the game just can't handle input at a reasonable rate. The thing is, the bug that causes things to pop in the list could literally happen at any time, so even if you wait it could still show up as you are pressing the button or space bar.  
---
I am pure melee/nades/demo expert
---
Youre correct, there is no room for debate. Being disconnected after dying is not how Bethesda intended the game to run
---
It's lame, but in that situation it's on your team to not let him see you. You've also managed to scare someone off and secure the location for yourself, hypothetically. 
---
I do not envy Bethesda. They have their work cut out for them with this new mode. 
---
Admirably, in my opinion. Sure, it's not the flavour-of-the-day handmade but it's a cool gun with great effects. It also seems more durable than the handmade and certainly more than the combat rifle I have.
---
Depending on the location of the Nuke, a bunch of glowing ones show up in Hornwright's, few legendaries, though.  
---
I was reading the other day that Vault-Tec University might be a good location for the shear number of glowing ones.  According to the post, WhiteSprings still has the most legendaries but Vault Tech would give more XP.
---
Oh good lord I couldn‚Äôt stand a controller in ANY FPS, unless I have no choice (console)
---
It's only unreasonable when you create straw-man arguments for me. Well done. Yes, the game has a long way to go before it's smooth. But I play a lot of games, and there isn't ANY game I would blindly trust with two hours of progress, much less a recently launched game. Even less a recently launched Bethesda game. Crashes happen often enough that OP should have known better. That doesn't change the fact that Bethesda has work to do, just the same way that Bethesda having work to do doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise common sense.
---
And I'm not going to respond to any more comments if you're just going to create absurd arguments for me, just to make your position seem stronger.
---
how did you know that you maxed out the mods for the gun?
---
Howd you get so many so congregate? Can you just take them anywhere?
---
I do wish you luck. But at the same time if you get it right off the batt I‚Äôll be so mad. I‚Äôm up to about 8 hours of hopping now. Just stopped for today. 
---
Sure, link below, or just search Spotify for FO76 by robobor.

---
I love the chameleon gear and just started doing this part time as a change of pace. 
---
You should mive the camp from there. It's too crowded there,aome cluless chap will kill it and you'll have a permanent 10% budget lost.
---
I'm strictly a PvE player, but I know people and there's no chance PvPers won't farm everything in Adventure mode, then hop into Survivor mode just for killing.
---
It's why I don't understand why Bethesda didn't just create an arena, as there is zero chance anyone will do quests, events, storyline or grinding in Survivor mode. 
---
Love the nuke idea
---
oh, and for end game, it's great. Get in my inbox and i'll give you some more tips on your commando build :)
---
I move my camp frequently and start over so I can try new designs in different spots. I usually breakdown the blueprint and start a whole new project usually scrapping things along with it. Seems like the budget changes when you move it though usually costs less to place the blueprint again but its not a significant change for me :(
---
I carry 2. 2 last me a week. With doubled fusion core duration.
---
That sounds great man, I would be happy to trade my explosives with you. Do you have a Discord? 
---
Id rather have nothing then a goddamn chameleon wood armpr piece.
---
It doesn't work at this time.
---
3500 is really good for a max level TSE, they sell for much more. Despite what anybody tells you TSE will still be broken and pretty much the best universal damage dealer, you'll need specific circumstances like low health bloodied to beat it. While AA will technically add more damage than TS, TS will still double the explosive radius. Oh, and the gatling gun is pretty much the only heavy that doesn't suck other than the .50 cal. 3500 is a steal no matter which platform you're on
---
yes get that poor girl a xbox controller for that thing 
---
That could the case.  But who dumped the stuff for other people shouldn‚Äôt be mad if someone came by and took it all.  
---
There noway to stop it.  So granted if i was the person leaving legs in the open world to share, i wouldn‚Äôt be mad if 1 person took it all and start chasing them down.  
---
Why is so hard for some of you to understand that it isnt about losing the junk. Its about the game not working as intended. The op is upset because he should have the chance to get his stuff back. But being dc'd after a death takes that away. 
---
1000?
---
Thanks for this. I'd have kept using Brotherhood underarmor assuming the boost gives HP increase...
---
Just remember how erring on the side of being generous can really make someone else's day.   I love picking on people in gentle ways  (taking their crops that will grow back or looting their unlocked resources) but on the same side, if I come across someone in person I'll drop them anything I can spare because I know it can really help when they are low on ammo and I may have extra that I'm not going to need.   Also, life is confusing like that.   :)
---
This is some Sopranos level waste management.
---
Platform?
---
There are specific locations on the map where "random events" occurs. Sometimes the random event will be a tamable pet, and only those can be tamed.
---
The bridge south of harper's ferry seems to be the best spot because to my knowledge it's the only place where 2 random events are generated at once, thus doubling your chances (probably a bug!)
---
It‚Äôs because POS duper‚Äôs, whenever they are on a server it crashes... 
---
I know but damn that 20 pound hunting rifle. Especially when running shrouded wood armor, so no deep pocketed. 
---
Stealth rifleman is actually quite good for PVP, hide in bushes and vats/tankkiller people
---
What is being fixed?
---
It would be handy if there was a mini map. Throwing 100 corpses on an already crowded spinning compass is going to be completely useless.
---
and tell your customers to rob the place! Chad, Wallace, and Beckham crack me up. Oh, and Miguel's bot too. I love them!
---
They'll still be the two best rolls you can get on a ranged weapon though. I agree that energy weapons suck but if that was a shotgun or rifle it would be about 5k minimum
---
I had my crafting perks enabled during the screenshot because i was scaving so i guess the pistol is showing what it has. https://imgur.com/a/hwyKrTi
---
I have 8 smaller water purifiers because I can use 16 purified water to make a decent amount of adhesive and still have a little water left over for other stuff.
---
Yea it had me fooled too!
---
I really like the radium rifle too and I feel like it's way underated
---
yea it had me fooled too!
---
Drop a single round. Then step back and ensure the bag is there. Then you can transfer into it with confidence.
---
üòÇ 
---
Before the game can highlight corpses, it needs to not make corpses disappear first, or drop through the floor or ground, or do anything that render them invisible.
---
Sounds like something a duper would say
---
Fake News!!
---
Yes. Despite using a bunch of mechanics and systems already in place in previous Fallout games, it's 99% Day Z.... Fucking internet. 
---
Here I'll give you an easy one, if 99% of the game is a Day Z rip, name 5 mechanics that were directly lifted. Just 5, that weren't present in some form in previous Fallout games.
---
I talked to devs in Paris about accessibility options for Ghost Recon Wildlands at a player summit a few years ago. Did the same with EA on Medal of Honor Warfighter before Danger Close was shut down and became DICE LA. You could use it as a case study and see how other teams have successfully implemented accessibility options.
---
Rather than just UI changes, they implemented a filter based on which form of color cone deficiency a player had that actually changed how the game looks (to us) much like the filters for Photomode that are currently in the game right now, but always active. Without them ‚Äî I‚Äôd never be able to see grenade indicators or hostile markers. Now I can.

---
If you‚Äôre interested, I could also send you my presentations and powerpoints.
---
I hope so.
---
I just got an explosive quad double barrel, any advice for mods?
---
The game not working as intended is not an absurd argument and you agree with my view, so there isn't really an argument here. Like i said in my first comment, players should plan for dc's because it happens
---
Yes! Spread this like the plague. Too many lost items from this. They just need to fix the trading price slider :/ only reason I don't use the trade for quick stuff like that
---
Ooh and make 'em like Pokemon in that you can't rename someone else's trade
---
Probably not. 
---
What system are you playing on? I have one of PS4 just taking up space in my stash
---
Done,  My in game name is Pho_Qing, and I'll be on in 3 hours, at 5 PM EST, cool?
---
I have an extra. My ign is YuuB0t, I'll be on at 6 cst.
---
&gt;i feel like im being robbed of something i could have.  
---
&gt;Does that sound bratty?
---
No. It's called opportunity cost and it's a real thing. You elected to spend your time pursuing this opportunity and it cost you time when it didn't pan out due to a problem outside your control. 
---
Now if only I could get credit for the *many recipes* I've learned, while the game challenge for this only recognizes five. :|
---
You will only get banned if you have 1000 guns!
---
My best suggestion would be to brown bag them. Yea it‚Äôs a loss of equipment but but if it saves you from getting banned.. then no loss. 
---
Thanks. Yes, I‚Äôve been looking around Harpers, to the north and to the south. The south is where I met the deathclaw. I read another of your comments in this thread that said you use Animal Friendo only, so I‚Äôm going to try that. 
---
Maybe read the changelog tomorrow before saying that? 
---
Oh crap PS4
---
I‚Äôm on PC, but I really appreciate the offer! Thank you!
---
I‚Äôm in a discord which one you mean?
---
It doesn't make much sense because you have the attention span of a gnat and you refuse to get the point regardless of what someone else says.  Your answer is still to "get better" which is a sign of a really weak mind that can't fathom nuance or understand larger more complex systems.  Enjoy your short bus.
---
01/28/19 still bugged
---
lol she's not playing cod  you dont need presise mouse controls 
---
Definitely not, bloodied and explosive will be the best. Even then, not worth 5k. I've never paid that much for a tse nor have I charged that much. That's ridiculous and greedy pricing
---
I try to drop food and water for lower level players but they usually end up running away before I can drop everything lol
---
The boost in defense while reloading is a pretty cool effect I haven't seen before. Would work very well for a sort of old western roleplay too lol
---
What about the game would you improve if you could?
---
Patch notes today?
---
I finally got it killing a yao Gui at the motel north of the top of the world area (sorry I'm not in front of my game and I forget the name of the location). It's the same motel where you need to loot a body for the top of the world quest to begin. 
---
Found it ty 
---
I hope you fall n break your leg.
---
Glad it's known and being addressed.  It freaks me out when it looks like big obvious bugs like this aren't known issues yet... 
---
Nah i know better. Considering alot of the "fixes." Arent huge in game problems like server stability, COMPLETELY stopping duping, and base phantom weight.
---
I don't think it is, no.
---
Hmmmmmmmm? Must have been done already. Look it up first maybe
---
You're an idiot, stop playing this game with that toxic stick up your ass
---
2 downvotes?
---
Truth hurts dont it.
---
Yikes. By the looks of it, I'm guessing it's a good thing my friends and I haven't jumped back in. Is it still really that bad? There should have been blanket stability established by now.
---
No, you're fine. As long as you dont dupe or have an excessive amount of items on you that would warrant suspicious then you're fine
---
Will players be compensated with atoms? I esitmate I'm owed around 800-1000 atoms for weekly challenges not working
---
Morton or something like that? 
---
I get this on PC whenever I use vats when over-encumbered, I just assumed it was from one of the interface mods I was using.
---
I keep finding fusion cores, have about 80 now. It‚Äôs insane wish I could sell them to vendors
---
I just got it and it‚Äôs pretty good. The combat just sucks. But it‚Äôs hard to beat the Bethesda rpg style and I really like the C.A.M.P system 
---
&gt; so gating the low levels probably won't happen 
---
Why not? Don't gate them, just make it so that any character sub-50 doesn't count towards making her stronger. That way the newbies can still come but not be a burden. Obviously won't help in the case of those lvl 60 casual players doing 5 damage, but it would take your 12 down to maybe 7 or 8. 
---
Happy to help.
---
i actually dont like accessing my items in pipboy..it scares me..what if this is one of my legendaries and i actually dropped it and lost..scares the crap out of me..i use my favorites menu to avoid this
---
Role-playing is against the terms of service. A couple dudes got banned for it a few weeks ago.
---
Have you tried changing servers? Last time it happened to me, I scrapped everything, but it still would not let me build anything. Once I left the world, and came back, the budget sorted itself out.
---
&gt; No one is duping a 1 star dude
---
pretty sure people were duping 1 star two shots, saw one guy selling a crazy amount of them and he wasnt the only one
---
Gary Harry Barry banana fana...
---
Betheada obvioualy dossent understand the quality &gt; quantity line
---
Why else make a big deal over 150 minor things, no one even read the entire 150. Shows you how much people care about quantity.
---
No game is perfect give it time 
---
Right? And both guys were dressed in suits and shades lol. I was legit impressed with their scheme, which is why I don't mind being a part of it. I'm a filthy casual, though, so I haven't benefited much from it often, but it is definitely some interesting player driven content.

Watoga High School Monster Mash... maybe..?

Yeah fair enough lol
---
I tend to stick to trading for 0 caps now to avoid this. Thx for the awareness post 
---
I have a missile launcher at my camp. It's 4 stories tall.
---
I'm PS4 and only lv21 so I've barely dabbled in PA - this was an almost entire set of T45. At the moment I'm spending most of my caps on fast travel. I appreciate the offer though... Ad Victoriam. 
---
Just crashed on me now 
---
The exact place is here:

---
At the intersection of the road and the railway
---
I've also read that it spawns from a random event in that area, so I got into the habit of checking my map for events in that location. Finally, last night, I saw the event beacon on the map and dropped some caps to fast travel to it. Only to get disconnected from the server mid-travel and re-log onto one where the event wasn't taking place.  fml.
---
yeah tried many times all sorts of different ways.
---
start fighting the queen in survival mode and kill the lower level chaff
---
Would be to hard to play the screen would not fit well when you cut a tv in half
---
This is not feasible at all unfortunately. 
---
They're gonna ban the fuck out of you. Good luck fuck
---
PC, level 6
---
Nah. It's because you are an angry shithead who doesn't know how to write well.
---
Allow us to add ballistic fiber and leather/steel to make it upgradeable armor
---
I don't know. That sounds more like psycho. 
---
yeah the other day when i was trying to give the bat in the trade menu..he said it wasnt coming up..so he logged back and then i tried to drop the bag..GONE
---
Yep. Only in blast zones. Only in power armor. 
---
That would be fantastic but that fact that it wasn't mentioned in the ItV is disconcerting.
---
No, it‚Äôs not. And those people got banned for being assholes. 
---
Don‚Äôt be a moron.

That's because minigun rounds are generally very low damage each with extremely high fire rates making it very inefficient to use in combat; Fallout 4 is the same way. The one way the weapon is good is with the melee attachment and using that in close range or with secondary damage legendaries.  Most of the other heavy guns are very usable unless the ammo is hard to come by like the .308 with low crafting amounts. People always tend to go towards the strongest weapons with the easiest to gather ammo instead of using something different and fun; hence why everyone uses the gatling gun these days. Once this nerf roles in even more people are going to swarm the heavy weapons and melee because of how powerful they are compared to everything else. I agree that every would should have an advantage and disadvantage but the stats are mostly based around vanilla Fallout 4 so you should already know what is king.
---
idk. i think it would be funny, and plausible, that some of the main issues and complaints people have about the game, are because it was made with next gen in mind. i mean look at eso, and all the updates and stuff it is still getting. i would have to think they would have the same idea for this. 
---
Try using a laser gatling, they eat fusion cores for breakfast \^\^
---
It's typical reddit ignorance. Dupers are the cause of all the problems the game has, anyone who trades is a duper, anyone in possession of desirable weapons is a duper, anyone I don't like is a duper etc etc.
---
It doesn't help that people post fanfiction about "busting" dupers and idiots upvote their fiction.
---
Eh, I‚Äôve got a 10k+ tooltip on a Deathclaw Gauntlet...
---
Regardless i got my money back and the issue was resolved. Im sorry you cant justify a waste of 60$ when you see one but i can. Like i said before i gave them 2 months to try and address these issues and wtf do we get? 200 more stash limit like we are a bunch of jokes.
---
Actually dude you are whats wrong with the world. Allowing companies to step all over you and take advantage of what you work hard for. Im sorry you have 0 self respect to stand up for what is actually right but the fact that you even remotely support this company shows how much of a herded sheep you actually are. Sorry but my 60$ was not justified even after giving the company and the game a chance. I just don't let people walk over me cause i'm not a snowflake loser
---
So start your own company and make a better one.
---
Xbox? I mean, not many people have described me as cool but I can come along for a bit.
---
Do that.
---
Still get occasional vertibots because bureaucracy. Fits with the theme.
---
Option 1: Sell 1 console and game that allows 2-4 people to play on it so everyone can share.
---
Option 2: Sell 1 console and game that allows 1 people to play on it so you make more profit.
---
I wonder which one the people making games and gaming devices for money would choose.
---
On the bright side, the happiest possible ending for Morton is that he's stabbed to death by a Jet addict and quickly forgotten about.
---
Bloodied is much better on melees because of the perks which increase strength and how strength equates to melee damage. Not sure yet if Bloodied will stack up to Two Shot and Furious for pre-fixes for ranged weapons. Number crunchers will chew on that after the nerf
---
I've been playing since November's launch and have only encountered two griefers in that time. Everyone else has been super helpful and pleasant. Odds are that higher level just wanted a fast travel or was bored and wanted to team up with someone they thought they could help. I'm level 78 at this point and routinely look after the health and well being of low levels when I see them nearby.
---
Thanks for the reply! You brought up very good points that I agree with all of them. 
---
This game definitely struggles with it in terms of main story. The scorched beast story felt like it should have been a major side quest for a region or two instead of all the regions. Right now, it just kinda feels like I'm walking through an evil murder hobo's failed campaign. I hope that in their future dlc, they can go against their world philosophy of no humans and introduce more meaningful characters and actual populated towns/cities.
---
As for your empty cities point: I think the settlement system could be used where you gotta make a recruitment beacon, worry about food/water/defense/happiness and the like or atleast something to accomplish the mission of the game.
---
Also, what do you think might make a good endgame for FO76? 
---
Which platform? I've not played for sometime and I'm looking to get back. I love checking out lore and it'd be fun to do it together.
---
Aw that's a rough draw man. I've had a bag go missing in similar scenario but was only some medical supplies for a beginner so I just dropped them again. 
---
This is confirmed 
---
Hardened Receiver, True Long Barrel, Stabilized Stock, Reflex Sight Circle, No Muzzle. That's what's on mine and makes it the best without sacrificing any stats. Combine those with Enforcer 3, and Skeetshooter 3. Enforcer deletes scorchbeasts, and Skeetshooter lets you snipe accurately, hip fire or aimed. I have the 3 base shotgunner perks to gain 30% damage, rather than fully upgrading shotgunner to 3 and getting only 20% damage. I hope this helps!
---
-	the story is boring and non-immersive
---
-	the world feels empty and lifeless despite a full server of players
---
-	stash box seems to get full to quickly
---
-	at times ill receive a negative status effect with no way to cure like worm lung
---
-	numerous glitches and game crashing bugs 
---
-	enemy levels are so broken, ill get wrecked by a level 30 cockroach but wont have much trouble taking down a level 30 deathclaw 
---
-	vendor prices are absurd
---
-	no one ever wants to do a proper trade, just wants drops
---
-	redundant event missions with cooldowns to get the enclave suit
---
-	bethesdas attitude to criticism game during release was awful and has guarantees i wont purchase another title from them
---
-	holotape audio is so quiet with no option to turn it up
---
-	
---
I have one. I just like you get over 900 shots and its easier to aim vs the plasma lol
---
I guess what you will say next is "Bethesda should pay me $60 dollars to play this game instead" ?
---
Also add split screen duping, my friend wants the FULL fallout experience.
---
Don‚Äôt mind me. I‚Äôve only played FO76 for 200hrs, and FO4 for 1400hrs, and never thought to try that üòë Thanks for the advice
---
Yeah it was so amazing when I got it as high level. I even found one receipe on WS cook that I didn't have, the sweet roll. It's impossible to keep manuall track of all receipes, to be able to know there's one amount few dozes on the list, that you don't have.
---
Or anyone into camp building, same thing for WS camp plans.
---
One unicorn that I encountered must have set his music player of choice as the mic in. Surprisingly good.
---
Spice girls on repeat, not so much.
---
Ive given it since beta day one up until today
---
Of course it is everyone knows dupers are in the trees aduhh.
---
We post them when the game goes down for the patch so players have something to read while they wait.
---
good bot
---
&gt;I punch all the balloons . . . into showers of confetti.
---
Holy shit, I had no idea they explode into confetti. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I'm sorry guys, I'm getting nailed by a snow storm and my net keeps going in and out.
---
Idk why you got down voted.
---
Get nuked from orbit by the music industries copyright hawks vs piss off a few players. Easy one.
---
I'm pretty sure I got some in the area between the Carson Family Bunker and the treehouse complex, shortly before getting my lv21 arse handed to me on a plate by a giant toad.
---
I will try, my net keeps cutting in and out
---
Everyone has their own opinion. 
---
Mine is this game is good fun.
---
Are you using targeting hud on PA or berry mentats?
---
PC split screen would only work if you have 2 monitors and really my computer has enough power to run the game twice at the same time so I could play with 2 people on my computer if there was a way to set a Mouse and keyboard/controller to only work on 1 or the other apps.
---
I've found a couple.  Not even sure where they came from.  Just makes me think of Dogmeat, though.
---
Agreed. In fact, I‚Äôll likely shelve the game for a while if this isn‚Äôt the large update that was promised. 
---
bog events, post-queen vendors, mob drops.
---
FYI, you cannot learn dense or BoS from scrapping.  Plans only.

---
yea definitely a "Disconnected From Server" message right in the middle would make it.
---
This is one of many new bugs that started happening to me every session since the last patch. 
---
See that is the right way to do it. Saturday, I made a trek of not fast traveling looking for Grahm, since I was walking I accumulated a lot of stuff to sell. Started at Harpers ferry, worked up &amp; around to grafton, then south to whitesprings and finally watoga. 
---
At whitesprings, I was severely overburdened before I got to the vendor there (900 lbs most of combat rifles and shotguns) anyways, a player with a 5c wanted level started getting near me. I think he wanted someone to help with that. Had he not been dressed in the chipmunk head, clownsuit, and while wielding an axe I might have helped. But I *noped* the fuck out of there by leaving server, had a lot of good junk I didn't want to chance losing anything.
---
TL;DR: Don't dress as a homicidal varmint if you want help to be relieved of your wanted level. 
---
Nope I don‚Äôt even grab mentats 
---
Yeah, man! I have a code lock door too. Just wish it wasn‚Äôt inverted. üòÇü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Pick up weapons that enemies drop and sell them to vendor robots. You'll be able to rack up a steady income of caps like that
---
Oh they know. They juat dont give a shit.
---
I have the same issue. Even scrapped my entire house but the foundation and stairs are apparently permanent. Only bright side is I was able to sink them down into the lake for what appears to be pier access. The other set ended up being an obnoxiously large deck. Not what I wanted but I get a lot of compliments
---
I also just recently learned the sweet roll recipe and for the same reason.  :)
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and let Betheada take care of it on their end.  You and I are free to listen to what we like. 
---
 "bethesdas attitude to criticism game during release was awful and **has guarantees i wont purchase another title from them"** That is a good one.
---
Is the trading glitch fixed?
---
Jesus christ dude it's a video game its not like hes going to fucking rape you and burn your house down. Ffs.

exactly

As the father of a new baby I laughed to hard at this lol
---
Them = amazon
---
Honestly as this point I don‚Äôt even want to play the game that much so I‚Äôm just going for that refund. Glad yours works though üòÑ
---
In that case have you tried buying Skyrim across multiple platforms and in VR? Maybe a blood sacrifice to Todd Howard and Pete Hines?
---
I'm on PC.
---
Well, i'm at 900 hours in the game and i've hardly seen any Radium rifle mod plans, you get the odd mod box here and there but that's about it...
---
One shotting just leads to a bad pvp experience overall; most people are completely against that sort of combat. It's way more intense be part of a firefight where you can exchange gunfire for at least a few seconds. I can understand one shotting with a powerful sniper rifle to the head though; I can't however see it being doable with a body shot on anything else but a shotgun at point blank range. Rust at least has pvp right, if you are looking for a good game focused around pvp go play that.
---
I bought my TSE gatling gun for 3000 caps + 2000. 50cal rounds so
---
Good. So am I. Pm me if you wanna play. We'll set something up.
---
Bethesda will most likely go after the seller, not the buyer. Take pirating movies or games, for example, they usually go after the one distributing.
---
I play an old school MMORPG, real money traders have been a life long problem. The developers have always gone after the seller, not the buyer. It is also more profitable to do so as sellers will usually buy another copy of the game.
---
rip, hopefully there will be a pc version of me out there!
---
The only thing I don‚Äôt like about mine is that you can‚Äôt have pets because they can‚Äôt climb there, and the sound of wind makes it feel lonely. Oh and you people fast traveling there has a 25% chance of falling 600‚Äô if you aren‚Äôt prepared.
---
I've seen a few.  I'm sure they are specific to one or two vendors.  I'm trying to remember which ones.  (My best guess is Harper's Ferry or Watoga or Watoga #2 (since there are two vendors there))   But I certainly cannot swear to it at all.
---
Build a wall below it! (if you can). 
---
I spent a long time trying to get this right, and it essentially boils down to the wall below it. If you can, build a temporary wall below it that is facing the direction you want and then place the code door on top of the wall. You should be able to delete the temporary wall no problem but the door should be facing keypad out.
---
Everyone knew what this was going in. You knew people would be Raiders because we've been asking for it. Did anyone seriously think we'd just step out of the Vault and it would all be sunshine and rainbows? What game did you have in mind that had a fair post apocalyptic hellscape? 
---
I cannot believe i missed this. We have been looking in the guide. Thank you!

I loved swg.  I miss swg.

I mean my brother was just born 12 hours ago so should I try sacrificing him to our lord and savior Todd?

&gt;And last we heard was player-vending was supposed to be in this patch

where did we hear that?

Yeah...well.....thats just, like, your opinion man.

That sounds absolutely fucking disgusting. I‚Äôll take the advice of a fellow Enclave lover and switch to Psycho.

You got a mic? Add me on discord russo#7530

When do you usually play/want to play?
---
They implement this today and mark my words, tomorrow this sub will be filled with: "Griefers are locking down all the silo's so people can't launch nukes!"
---
"griefers are taking too long to get through silo's so no one can launch nukes!"
---
"PSA: If you get disconnected after starting a silo, it will glitch and NEVER leave lockdown"
---
"If you're below level X PLEASE do not enter silos, those of us that can actually complete them would like to launch nukes."
---
and on and on.
---
Yeah, i have all the handmade mods too I think. Much, much easier to get but still it's a rare drop if you don't have the plans. I only know of one guaranteed spawn point for handmades, and as far as i've been able to find, there are no guaranteed radium rifle spawns...
---
Once your bounty exceeds the amount of caps you have on you, you should deal zero damage to players and camp/workshop items. The PvP debuff when you die with zero caps should be 100% as well, not 50%. 
---
You should also not be able to trade while you are wanted. 
---
yeah, i've got an amazing raider chestpiece and I cannot get that dense mod anywhere!
---
I would imagine the camp system will be the same, but players may handle them differently.  Right now I deploy my base (at cranberry bog) when I am there, then pack it up when I leave, I would imaine there will be more of that going on.
---
Vying for attention 
---
thats fine it's died a ton of times the budget always comes back for me 
---
You can also buy / find grape nuka cola that will remove rads.   I have the perk that remove rads during the day.  I can highly recommend that, but I don't remember what level that dropped for me.  It might have been a bit higher.
---
And exactly how is that a gameplay mechanic you can play/plan around? Change your name to "Don't-Come SBQ-Or-Me-Mad"? Tweet the Todd Godd hoping he'll hook you up with an unpopulated private server where your free to farm low pop SBQ events until the end of time?
---
Ok thanks.  Actually i came across a massive treehouse down there today.   Is there a way in?
---
That is a really cool idea, and I appreciate the thought, but it's typically a good idea to put them out ahead of time so us, the players, can know what to expect. For bug fixes this is usually not a big deal but for re-balancing it can allow us to adapt without the shock on patch day.
---
I Know the train Depot location north east of whitesprings has a wrecked building that allows you to enter a safe room like a Bank vault for for the train station. Most of the safes are destroyed but 3-5 are pickable ranging from easy to Max level difficulty. 
---
You find the usual pre-war money, weapons and chems I have also found randomly a magazine and bobblehead in that area.
---
Be on guard though their is normally a high level mob spawn like a legendary Dominator assaultron.

i'm on ps4 matey

They need to rerelease the blackbird and hot rod paints
---
Hey good tip... Might need to beef up my charisma (or mentat/hat collection) first to get better prices though... my current build is more brute strength than charm.
---
I dont condone child sacrifices.......but just how bad do you want that budget increase......thats the real question. Will the budget increase make up for not having a gaming parner for life?
---
I mean when you factor in he could be a goddamn normie then,...well i mean the decision is yours but i think a goat or some poulty will suffice

How the hell are people getting these as pets?

Yeah I do.

I'm usually on during weekends. Weeknights sometimes if my schedule allows it.

Right on. Atom shop purchase?
---
If you're on Xbox, I can assist with modifications if needed!
---
Sure, but I think it's evolution is due to misunderstanding it originally lol.  The term f2p would not be necessary if it we're not for the fact games made you pay monthly to play.  Free games we already had a term for, it was "free" lol.   Anyway, you'll see, as aimbots and godmode users get called "duper" lol

Try buying Skyrim across multiple platforms and in VR
---
How about a little icon like we get for using a Recon Scope or a quest marker for any corpse on which we have loot rights?
---
We know this already works because we get a miscellaneous quest on our own death bag.
---
Still, by the time you typed all that, a tooltip could have been implemented.
---
Yes I've found that terminal.  I was thinking DLC as well.
---
What's your PSN?
---
Which I understand and still disagree with. Adventure or Survival, some just do not have the time to walk about a game instead of playing.
---
I just had the small 1/4 by 1/4 screen floor in my bathroom for the longest time.  You had to squat and hope everything would... uh... fall through.  Didn't even have letters to warn people not to walk under the bathroom floor being my house was 4 stories up.  Whether you got pooped on was a literal crap shoot. 
---
Hmm i have TSE minigun, and i melt everything with it. Minigun out dps any other heavy weapon i believe. 
---
There's quite a difference between exploiting a known and obvious bug, like the repeatedly disarming trap glitch, and just playing the game as intended, without even knowing that the enemies were giving too much experience. Kinda like how intentionally going through the steps to dupe items is exploiting, but having your crops or purifiers duplicate themselves without doing anything intentional to make it happen is not exploiting.
---
That said, I was never one for farming Whitesprings. Every nuke I've ever launched has been at prime.

Mackdaddycash

"You look a little low".

Hmm.  Yeah I'm not buying it.

So much hate...

Now I know ya ain't quittin on me! I need you to keep drinkin those  beers so you can help me stop them Duke boys from spoilin all my crooked  Hazard County schemes.

I appreciate guns and armor breaking and it‚Äôs definitely realistic but so damn annoying. Items shouldn‚Äôt break so damn fast, period.

Dang it.  This is my spot, don't go showing it to people so I have to move it. lol
---
Appreciate the share!
---
Ultracite becomes incredibly common at higher levels when you're doing 10+ SBQ fights in a weekend. I'm at the point where I sell all my excess to vendors.
---
9 perks in Strength, 3 in Int, 3 in Charisma, 5 in Agility, 3 in Luck... 3 more in Int (Nerd Rage)... 2 more in Luck (Starched)... Adrenal Reaction Mutation... Bloodied Legendary... 20% HP praying not to get hit by poison and FINALLY it feels "acceptable" ... ... ... ... or ... just pickup a Shotgun or Super Sledge.
---
Well servers are going down tomorrow so hopefully this is 1 thing they will fix. I‚Äôve had 3 star legendary drop nothing and felt so disappointed.
---
Pc first or all platforms? 
---
Nice one LOL
---
What level are you?
---
Probably nerfing TSE weapons
---
I would definitely read each and every single thing addressed
---
Maybe. But probably only in small percentage. Without fresh pve or pvp content, people will drop off anyway. If done right, survival mode might encourage more trading. I can see ammo trading will be hopping at least in the beginning.
---
I think I might of seen it down near site Charlie vendor (train station very south near bunker) but not 100%
---
Lucky he didnt block you, unblock you kill you, rhen block you again.
---
I hate to be this guy, but do you know by any chance if theyre fixing some of the broken interactions between Class Freak and some mutations like Empath?
---
Doubtful. I've had a TSE Gauss Rifle for a couple weeks now (I traded fairly for it, but really, what are the odds this thing wasn't duped at some point?) and I've been fine, even when submitting support tickets and drawing attention to my account. 
---
Bottom line is, Bethesda can't be any more certain of an items origin than we are, and with the bad press 76 already has, they're not going to risk alienating the few players they have.
---
Considering this thread has been made 10000x, I‚Äôm pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt read. 
---
Maybe a fast travel lockout? No fast travel for 30minites after a pvp encounter?
---
A nuke from Bravo was launched directly at Alpha in my server last night (XB1). There was no noticable difference, which is a bummer. The area was lacking in any sort of enemies besides some scorched and super mutants. The only positive was the abundance of nuked plants around a pond by the silo. 
---
2/10 would not recommend. 
---
I've burned hundreds and hundreds of wood making food and drink.  You mean to tell me I can't use any of the charcoal I've generated?  Coal shouldn't even be an issue.
---
My biggest PvPeeve is when someone one shots me, steals all my junk, and then immediately leaves the server before I‚Äôm even able to respawn. I know that the other player has the ability to one shot me, so why are they leaving? 
---
To avoid retaliation? Just one shot me again.
---
To deny me having a chance of getting some of my junk back? See the above answer.
---
Think that is pretty well summed up....be great if they could fix some of these things 
---
On the topic of switches, are the keypad pylons glitched or are they working as intended? Currently you can enter the password to burst power (like 3 seconds of power then it turns off) or you can hit the switch on them to toggle them on/off. The toggle function though makes the password part useless (anyone can hit the switch).
---
It would seem like only the owner should be able to hit toggle. Or at worst only let the switch toggle be used when the keypad is bursting power.
---
As they are I just don't see a good reason to use them.
---
How about a micro-GECK to build in your camp to give you a lush bit of green?  
---
Bonus if increases rate of crop growth.
---
I mean your personal discord name to be able to contact you \^\^
---
I mean he's my half brother who live with my father so there wont be a "gaming partner for life" option in my life anytime soon. Plus I cant risk the chances of him being a normie  üó°Ô∏è . We should probably be careful joking like this or we might be feature on a Fallout 76 hate circle jerk article by Polygon or some youtuber saying "Crazed Fans Sacrifice Child to Todd Howard in Hope to Fix Fallout 76!"
---
Suuure a buggy tooltip that does more harm than good, heh.
---
Nearly 500 advertisements and 300 sales published by the French community, we are waiting for the English community :) 
---
You know "I disconnect 45 times a day" is not a bug report. They have to start somewhere.
---
Oh Mackdaddycash I believe 
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be perk related if it‚Äôs a part of accessibility. It should be a display feature for everyone, not just who incorporates a two star card in to their build.
---
The reason why we said about perceptibobble showing an effect for deaf players is because that IS perk related, you have to have the card equipped to hear the tone.
---
Lol, I'll try that next time. 
---
I‚Äôve had a PS4 for 4 years and just learned this with 76. 
---
Oh but I just read the other comments, I'm on PC. Sorry! 
---
It‚Äôs fine
---
Because the game is running on an engine older than most of it's players. At it's base, 76 is running the same code as Morrowind. 
---
Holy shit.
---
Yeah... they need to fix that.
---
thanks for the explanation :)

Swing and miss: I got all the numbers.

You must really hate this game and/or bethesda lol. ANY online game you risk of disconnecting. Putting hours into it without saving the progress is the players fault. Why is it so hard for you to understand? 
---
Where is a good place to get Violet flux?
---
I think so, yes.  That's about all I spend my Atoms on.
---
(Until Bethesda gives me a big burly mountain man beard to buy!)
---
I saw a whole complex of tree houses like the Ewok village, but before I got closer enough to explore I spotted a fog crawler in the distance and noped back to the bunker to change my pooped Letterman outfit.
---
I would be down for this though my schedule doesn't allow for a lot of game time these days*
---
U have to grind certain random events and hope they drop or is given as an award for finishing the event...thinks the white powder one is on the event ‚ÄúThe Messenger‚Äù 
---
I can get all my Xbox friends to testify. I am not the only one. 
---
How do I get a tag like yours
---
On a similar vain of thought, who else thinks it would be funny if the rocket just self-destructed if you target the silo you're launching from?
---
Dupers are the Synths of Fallout 76
---
My wife and I, both new players around level 14, had a quest to collect some holotapes in an area to the south.  We didn't think anything of it, and headed down to take the quest head-on.  We arrived and killed quite a few enemies with just a little bit of issue, as they were only a few levels above us (21ish).  No big deal we thought.  Ok, so we'll just have to take it a bit slower since the enemies were larger than us.  So we headed into what we now realize is Whitesprings resort.  We collected the first two holo-tapes with very little in the way of difficulty, though admittedly we did have to dispatch a couple level 60 enemies, but they were each alone.
---
This is when things took a very massive turn for the worst.  We were leaving the big building in the resort, feeling safe with all these robots around to protect us.  Our last holo-tape was just over the hill in a small building.  Yeah, we can do this.  Upon arriving at the building, we were greeted by a level 59 enemy.  We shrugged and started shooting it.  Sure we can take this thing out, we've done it before.  But that's when his friends started showing up.  Within just moments we found our puny level 14 selfs being surrounded by tons of enemies all level 50+.
---
Obviously we died.  Over the course of the next two hours, we kept attempting to breach that building to retrieve the last holo-tape for our quest.  We finally did complete that quest, but it cost us a whole lot in the way of junk.
---
This was our first time experiencing the glorious issue of enemy leveling based on players in the area.  The whole experience was very depressing and frustrating.  After completing the quest, my wife and I high-tailed it to the north as fast as we could, and vowed to never again venture into any area where we could see high level players on the map.

---
My least favourite event oh well back to the grind I go... Thank u
---
I'm down to play. Would this be with new characters?
---
 20+ years is enough time for someone else up there to open that safe before you and us it as a stash. Just a thought.
---
Launch a nuke directly at the chute it came out of
---
It's a shame it doesn't heal for shit on the revive.
---
All you turret are belong to base
---
Yes, delete game data from your platform (character data is stored on servers at least for consoles), uninstall, then reinstall game. You will loose settings, controller settings, and pictures. I did a write up on this on here and it worked. Only crashes since have been because of Targeting HUD and 1 random one but this is with like 2 weeks of playing now at least hour or two a day. 
---
I just wanna ask if you know they game was supposed to be barren and large before you bought it?  Also did you know the story was mainly individual driven, like there is no guys standing around giving you quests. There are missions you can get from computers and robots but its mainly up to you to roleplay your own story, which is the way the game was intended and also advertised. 
---
So on just those two points alone were you misimform? Did you just expect something else? 
---
Many of your other points seem valid and i dont disagree with you. But i also want to ask your gonna judge the developer one this one game alone?
---
Thank u very much
---
That was a big reason why we mentioned the TSE changes in the Inside The Vault article, to give you all time to adjust and provide feedback. When we have enough notice ahead of time from Dev we will let you all know. :)
---
As someone who is basically a filthy casual at this point, I sincerely wish I could play the game that much, haha. I'm like in the 60s as far as level goes, and I'll hit up a nuke zone or two a week. I'm lucky if I even collect enough items  to go from unstable to stable flux. 
---
Scroll to the top of the page. To the right, there will be some text, "EDIT USER FLAIR". Click that, choose something you like.
---
Did someone say Sugar Boms? \*munches\*
---
Awh sorry mate lmao 
---
Good luck buddy 
---
I think it's only rum or bourbon. Wine definitly doesn't work and those brand name ones don't either. I haven't tested whiskey.
---
Or at least make bodies take longer to become piles of meat, because they're harder to find than bodies 
---
Thank you 
---
I use to accept invites from random people to give them free fast travels but most of them are griefers looking to destroy your camp now.
---
Not cosmetic, because I wanna keep the rad resistance.
---
And I didn't say anthing about unfair.
---
It's just a QoL improvement in my mind, especially point 2 of my request.
---
Ok, I see what you're saying, but this is an online game. We can't all be the chosen one or the sole survivor. 
---
Also, your previous post made a lot of generalizations about the old generation of fallout players versus the new, but your point here is completely opposite what many of the "old" fans have been saying for years. One of the biggest complaints against Fo4 was how you were pushed into this role of Nate/Nora, and you couldn't roleplay your own character.
---
you gotta have 3 ranks of animal friend and find a lone creature at one of the random spawns
---
im not sure
---
Avoid any areas of the map where you see a bunch of high level players until you yourself are a high level player.  The game spawns enemy levels based on the highest level player in the area.
---
Well no. It's more like I put $50,000 of my money into a savings account... and the bank then takes it, drives to the worst part of town, leaves it on a street corner and puts up a sign: "Plz no take." 
---
This bug ridden mess of a game just invites people to dupe/cheat/hack. Did they even fix the developer room yet? 
---
Thanks so much, this means a lot to me as a player.
---
This current patch is planned for all platforms.
---
That thing would wreck with a high luck pistol users build. Nice score!
---
If you think there should be more water in them than what is appearing in the little window that pops up when you hover over the purifier, select the transfer option instead. Sometimes there's a glitch which keeps the contents from showing in the initial display. This also holds true for any resource gatherer.  I once thought someone was coming into the munitions factory I'd claimed, picking the extractor lock, and making off with ammo because it appeared empty every time I checked. I don't know why, but for some reason I clicked transfer just to check and low and behold there's a couple hundred rounds of 5mm waiting for me to pick them up.
---
Blame this sub for perpetuating it with no mod oversight. The entire history of this sub can be summed up by blaming all of the games problems on 'dupers', and any criticism of the game gets mass downvoted because "only a duper would offer criticism."
---
Is there any requirement on charisma or creature level?
---
"the destroyer of worlds"
---
*plinking intensifies*
---
And radrats, if lucky.
---
yeah the 700 ammo lost was the worst lol
---
I'm level 56. I've seen Mothman once, and Flatwoods Monster once. Both were fleeting, as they scrammed as soon as I shot at them.
---
Doubtful. One of the main reasons we have the CAMP limits we currently struggle with is to keep people from building lag producing fortresses and crashing the servers. Given that the game has major stability issues as it stands, I don't see this changing any time soon.
---
Just read the new character part, my bad. My ign is YuuB0t discord is YuuB0t#5819
---
I am not sure on that one, I'll check with the Devs and get back to you on that.
---
Sorry, I know this was posted a couple days ago and I'm bringing it back up. Does anyone happen to know what happens if you recieved the power armor edition as a gift? My boyfriend ordered it for me and everything is registered under my Bethesda account. I sent in the ticket last week with a screen shot from Amazon showing it was delivered and my name, address, Bethesda acct, etc written on it. My ticket hasn't been touched but I'm afraid because it was ordered under a name that's not directly associated with my Bethesda acct, it'll be rejected. In which case, I have no idea what to do if it happens after the 31st.
---
I submitted late because I didn't realize they were actually replacing the bags, I thought they were just giving out atoms which I haven't even used the ones I've earned. 
---
Ha damn. What ammo was it?
---
PC tomorrow? Xbox? PS4?
---
Someone knows their shit
---
I still go invisible for my teammate all the time. Thats the main problem Im having. 
---
Probably already banned and doesn‚Äôt know it. Hope he doesn‚Äôt freak out when BGS gets a levy on his bank account...
---
Gatling guns are energy? I don't think so.
---
There's a theory going around that if you kill them too quickly and don't let them do their heal thing.  And I've seen no loot from the ones I've killed too quickly before, so I believe that could be true.  Doesn't happen all the time but is far more likely to happen.
---
So you're defending the game not working as Bethesda intended? Being dc'db without doing it on purpose lol, is not the players fault. I don't hate the game at all but i do dislike ppl attacking others for pointing out a frustrating bug in the game
---
Thanks for being a textbook example of how pathetic this sub is
---
But isn't the Institute just a bunch of professors hiding in MIT's basement at this point?
---
You can‚Äôt get this helmet anymore.  It was replaced by the Tactical version.  I‚Äôd be shocked if you could even repair one, if you still have one from Alpha/Beta.  I have one, but it‚Äôs in my stash and I don‚Äôt wear it.
---
Personally, I would use a different color of the markers that pop up on your screen when you are attacked (that show you the direction of the attack) and just have that pulse every few seconds. That would maintain a similar effect to the periodic audio cue of the current perk. 
---
The idea is to learn all mods, and in particular, when you learn a mod by use of very insignificant amount of of caps, you won't learn that when you scrap the weapon.
---
Granted I don't know if it has effect on making learning the rest through scapping, I think it should, but even if it doesn't, it's one mod written off as you've learned it.
---
Some mod plans of course are only via plans, and can't be learned through scrapping, like chambered receivers.
---
only 38 but still..
---
As of 28 January, bug still not fixed. No respawn, not in PA but overencumbered. Lost SOOO MUCH! üò†
---
I've had two decontamination showers.  You can get it again.  I've only done 1 queen event, ever, so I got my first decontamination shower somewhere else.
---
I got it during a Mr Messenger event just west of the scenic overlook and R&amp;G station, found a dead witch up in the mountains named ‚ÄúTrick or treater‚Äù and she had the plans on her.
---
Dizzyroostet8 please elaborate on Targeting HUD causing crash. I have the Targeting HUD on x01 and zero duped item. I crash (blue screen) constantly and when I go into a nuke zone I crash so much it is unplayable. Any advice you have please share. Thanks
---
I Finally Figured It Out I Had To Take all the junk I had in my stash and lug it to nearest power armor station before it would work. I even had to take the stuff that was not needed. And of course I forgot to put it all back and eventually lost it all. 
---
You want plans so
---
Thanks for the offer, but i already got it. 
---
I mean, I don't dislike the idea, but from a practical standpoint there's reasons why it shouldn't be implemented.
---
Ahahaha wow I love this! XD I have so so many questions
---
Also, anyone know if this will actually flag you as PvP ?  Or do they work like the orbital strike things?
---
Oh I feel you. A loss is a loss. Lol. I know u didnt ask but if you want replacements I've got loads if ur xbox üòÇ
---
It's the same as people going around calling people hackers... or nazis. Jk, just wanted to get political for a second.
---
LoL damn, it‚Äôs like an Easter egg hunt.
---
Are they? maybe there running experiments on how to destabilize Appalachia 
---
:D I think you had to use some shenanigans to get it to work that way in FO4. Seems to function normally in 76 though.
---
Nope I barley use my power armors
---
I was playing this weekend when some guy sent me a message wanting to trade. 
---
He had a nice 3 star explosive bleeding 2 shot shotty. 
---
I asked him how much and he said bout 350.
---
Well it's at that time I realized this duper was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! 
---
You might be able to reply to your own ticket to add this information. Ultimately, I think their primary goal is to make sure no receipt ever gets used twice, so... Hopefully you'll be ok.
---
Worst case if they have a problem with what you submitted, you should be able to add more info then. 
---
Yeah, I play a decent amount on weekends but it's more that people seem to constantly volley nukes at fissure prime. I was in a server this weekend that had all three launched in about a half hour span.
---
And if you are in need of ultracite, check out the AMS building in Watoga (it's the big, fancy centerpiece building from the map). There's a decent amount of it and it's not too well protected.
---
Or use the trade screen and give it to them as a 0 caps offer.  Though the trade screens aren't the best thing in the game, they're really clunky.
---
Go cry to your mom. 
---
I had someone do this. I was being nice using a non-OP weapon. Switched to my tse after the first one he kill. 
---
They're still going to be overpowered. So no, I don't think anyone's going to just hand you a TSE weapon. 
---
Wonder how long till people start screaming about bloodied next.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try that when I get home!
---
When I was there all I got was shot at by about a billion fucking robots. Nothing super nor duper about that!
---
Could mean either low health or low level for the area. Both completely plausible.
---
eh ?
---
I love that perk. I duped a helmet i made as well, and was like *giggles* "oh I'm a bad girl"
---
I am on Ps4 if you still have that shotgun I would love it maybe trade? Let me know. Cheersd
---
Loll
---
Update on this, they are working as intended. [Here is a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yttp3/about_keypad_switches/) with more information.
---
They want your stuff
---
thank u sir..but i am on ps4..appreciate it
---
Well, it's just my humble opinion. It's a good place to air it. I like a good story and getting involved in my story is a good way of involving yourself in the world. Many "old fans" may be saying the opposite, but this fan is saying he does. If everyone liked the same thing, we'd have a very boring life. Diversity is the spice of life, as they say.
---
Oh I'm down.  So I work at a sign place and I just made a gender neutral abortion sign to explain toxic masculinity :) make America great again 
---
I forgot about that part with the info, I didn't realize when I submitted the ticket that there wouldn't be a space for me to explain what happened so I've been a little worried since. 
---
Thank you for responding
---
I think I met you once in the Enclave Bunker. I remember thinking that the Patriot head looked good on the Blackbird body.
---
And lock them too, so they can't be accidentally traded/sold/dropped/etc.
---
yeah i tried to but he said nothing was coming up..the whole situation was awkward then annoying lol
---
I just hope for more stash and camp budget...
---
They didnt specify gatling laser or gun, so that's my bad for inferring one or the other. Either way, not worth 3.5k
---
PS4?
---
I assume adrenaline is the Agility perk and the cripple one or bloody mess are the luck perks, but what are the charisma ones? I don't really pay much attention to those.
---

---
‚ÄúLag producing fortresses‚Äù proof of people building structures to cause extreme lag or crashes? With the cost reductions or separate turret build limit it honestly wont produce that much more lag. 
---
That‚Äôs probably my biggest gripe in the game. There‚Äôs no lasting actions that impact from your decisions made in the game. The closest thing is Watoga after you do the mayor questline and make the robots not be hostile towards you. Hopefully things get updated soon 
---
only have 3 chra and yes i think the lvl 30 mirelurk king is the biggest thing you can tame
---
There isn't really.
---
Build in weird spots is about all you can do. And be aware how often you bounce to camp
---
They have too many pointless affects and also need a way to craft them. Tired of the RNG trap in gaming.
---
Agreed. The Blackbird paint came and went before I owned the game, and I'd gladly give Bethesda a few bucks for it.
---
and when you put your pointer on a tamable creature it will say "tame" instead of "pacify"
---
This has happened to me getting lots of enemies with no stars but their name says "Legendary ghoul" or what have you and usually don't drop anything.
---
I was able to scrap one and learn the recipe. If crafted or repaired to 200% is has a DR value of 18. If also counts as a gas mask and comes with the -2 PER penalty.
---
i pack the shower up when i dont need it
---
Keep fighting the good fight bro üòÅ
---
I finally leveled to 50 so I can use my tse Gatling/lever action after like 2 months. I didn‚Äôt get any duped guns or constantly farm Whitesprings, I looted both of those weapons myself and about an hour ago I was able to use them. I leveled up all rifleman and shotgun perks.
---
 If they nerf the damage down to nothing, I‚Äôm going to be very fucking pissed. Just nerf the bobble heads. I worked my virtual ass off to finally reach max level for weapons and armor, now I won‚Äôt be able to enjoy any of my well-deserved OPness.
---
If it does come down to that, I‚Äôll just use my 600 base bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. If they nerf THAT, then bye bye Fallout 76.
---
I'm kind of partial to Nanny Bot, mostly because I think it's funny that I get a story and juice.
---
Damn, willfull ignorance
---
A sight to behold
---
So far we've heard no indication what would be different besides some config changes.
---
We're at least a month out from the beta so we can test it then and provide feedback for changes.
---
Yes and no.   
---
They really did push that idea with how they sold the game. But the world really ISN'T empty. Or at least it wasn't meant to be. Appalachia isn't a dead region, untouched since the war. It's a thriving area that just got hit by a nasty plague.   
---
We find the recently dead remains of countless responders and raiders. All of whom died only days before because of the scorched. These are the survivors of the war (since the area was not really hit by the bombs) or their descendants. So the region is full of people who were alive only days (or if we want to be generous, weeks) before. But they're all dead. Corpses instead of active NPC's. Instead of a complex dialogue tree for these NPCs, we get a few, one-off holotape recordings. The kind of work that you could hammer out in 1 afternoon with a voice actor.   
---
And even then, that doesn't explain the lack of ghouls. All we get is a single note in Grafton put up by a ghoul trying to get other ghouls to head out east to the Capital Wasteland (eg Underworld). But from all the ferals running around, they appear to be immune to the scorch virus.   
---
It just seems less like a concept that was planned from the start, and more like a fix they came up with to make the game work within the limitations they were suddenly hit with.  
---
Like player merchants. From the interviews with the designers, they were talking about how you as a player could start up a store and sell steaks or something. You could become the best steak salesman on your server. But that's not true at all. You can't start a store. There's no way to advertise you have a store (no text chat, no way to put up signs outside your camp), no way to run a store when you're offline because you and your camp disappear from whatever random server you're on when you log off, and no NPC merchants you could put at your camp to run the store for you when you're offline. The game as is, cannot support that functionality. 
---
Not really finding you credible.
---
You talk how F2P used to mean no montly fee, then start talking about a game released this decade.
---
The entire purpose of a "Survival" mode is to make the game more arduous. If you don't have a lot of time to play a game, you wouldn't elect to play Survival mode to begin with. So why do you care?
---
Sadly no. Why this wasn't a day one feature in the ATOM shop along with the clean generators and water purifiers is beyond me. 
---
They can‚Äôt really prove you knew it was a duped gun. My guess is anyone with multiples of the same tse weapons will get banned. 
---
Now you‚Äôre considered an annoyance. 
---
Probably not.
---
Only if you have hundreds or thousands of the same item will you get temp banned and investigated.
---
Trading with dupers is aok
---
Remember what they did to me, Jason! Let them suffer like we did!
---
PC. So maybe not.
---
That's one gangsta azz squirrel dragging that kind of hardware, lol.
---
Oopsie, sounds like someone should have done their research on the [game design philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2854) before buying.
---
The other day, a group of kids started attacking me but they couldn‚Äôt kill me due to my Sentinel Assassin gear, so they started whining that I was in pacifist mode (I wasn‚Äôt). 
---
I shot them with anti-armor/explosive guns and was accused of Bobblehead stacking (never even did that). 
---
I also got called a duper/cheater because the Strange in Numbers perk was basically allowing me to fly. 
---
Honestly, I believe that the average, casual player just lack knowledge on the full capabilities of playing in the Wasteland. :(
---
Nice. I only have normal shotguns, no legendary ones yet. 
---
I get by pretty good. Though I‚Äôm always nervous to go into the mire alone. 
---
It's possible it's been fixed by now. I will admit it's been a while since I last tested it (when I found out it was broken I replaced it with just a floor plate). Random people kept coming across my camp and leaving the garage door open because they were able to toggle the switch without the pass code. That's how I realized that people could use the switch without a code.
---
The little red outlines makes the client unstable. Remove it if you crash alot
---
&gt;what are you fucking 12?
---
Oo thats a nice pistol, id like something like that for a medic ihavent even leveled up yet
---
At least you didn‚Äôt rearrange your spec before you found out. :|
---
The game is broken and taxic people do exist. 
---
But there is no better feeling than setting up camp next to vault 76 to hand out water, food and Stim packs to new playing to help them start their adventures.
---
Part of the fun is everyone starting out fresh, imo. It'd be like Day 1 all over again. Those were the days...
---
There is a whole mine of the stuff you can just walk into and pick up 30-40 of it in one run
---
If your crying about dupers, it's time to dupe your diaper.
---
It‚Äôs sad that this is how you see things. Or need to see things. Oof. Poor guy. 
---
Ive put all mods into stash, then i just carry 50 steel on my person at all times. I havent lost another mod yet.
---
It seems to me that it prioritize on person before stash, then no priority on what it breaks down if you dont have the "pure" scrap.
---
Glad they plan to fix soon, but maybe try this method until they're sure its working.
---
Tried that just now, durability loss seems the same.
---
In the parenthesis I said, ‚Äúnot the last Inside the Vault but the one before it.‚Äù I was wrong. There have apparently been a few ItVs since then but I forgot about them because they have so little information. 
---
Here‚Äôs this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ablivu/new_from_bethesda/
---
And I want to say it was in the Jan 9th one that said this patch, but it‚Äôs not there anymore. Could be I‚Äôve misremembered it. 
---
Actually you can befriend cats, dunno bout everything else tho
---
It's a known bug. There have been several write ups on reddit about it. Basically the targeting HUD or grape mentats (which give same effect) try to give the "sight" to every player around you and it overloads the systems causing a crash. Even when not around other players the game cannot compute properly what is going on and enemies wont highlight properly and it can cause crashes. Until this is fixed my targeting HUD helmet does not get used. This is unfortunate because it is my favorite helmet mod. 
---
Since I reinstalled I have had one episode of 3 crashes in under 10 minutes and guess what I was in? My power armor with Targeting HUD. After the third time i logged back in and immediately go out of the suit and stashed it away. Since then (this was over a week ago) I have crashed once and that was during like an all day play session where I was going from nuke zone to whitesprings and back. Should it happen, no, but as consumers we have allowed Bathesda get away with occasional crashes by saying 'well it's a huge game', which it is, but so is RDR2 the Witcher 3 and others. I digress...
---
Basically in a nutshell, Targeting HUD is broken as of now so unless you want to continue to blue screen take the Targeting HUD and store it for when it's fixed. Use VATs matrix or something for the time being. 
---
Not long.. at least with bloodied there's a fairly large drawback
---
&gt;Turn on pacifist
---
 Turn on pacifist 
---
I'm on ps4 and i average 1 crash every 10 hours. 
---
And most of that number comes from the first month after launch. 
---
Easy patch has made the game moor stable for me.
---
Btw dupers cause dcs, not crashes, but shitty internet does too.
---
You'll crash more if you just hop whitespring and do lots of nuke zones
---
Just make a cheap camp
---
Just jokin that small fixes for Bethesda usually break other sometimes bigger things.
---
I like that idea! 
---
I was the high level today in a very similar case. I had a 10 caps bounty,these 2 lvl 40/50 come at me and i two shotted both of them with a anti armor powerfist that does 300 damage. So yeah it's not always bobblehead stacking.
---
That's a dc, not a crash. There's a difference
---
Are there going to be patch notes today?
---
Tru. To a point.
---
I've spawned 1 step outside of a nuke zone.  I'm not surprised that you spawned inside of one.
---
Yes we have to gain much more levels to get these cards, yet
---
I agree. Not worth 3.5k
---
Just realize when you ask for PvE Only servers the stuff that is balanced by PvP needs to be a balanced for PvE no risk. IE the workshops, they need to nerf the rate in workshops if you have zero risk of some one else taking them over. 
---
How is it not working?
---
Quick question - have the devs tested whether the Queen is possible to kill with the TSE nerfs and low levels ramping up her difficulty? 
---
I'm concerned that no one will bother nuking the Queen (the only end game content currently) when a lot of heavy hitters now will do a lot less consistent damage. 
---
You have to be careful with the trade though - at least on PC the controls are bad, the key you use to accept/start a trade ends up with you offering some item up for trade when the window pops up, so you must absolutely cancel out of it.
---
Why on Earth would that be intentional? It's a known bug and occurs infrequently.
---
Can‚Äôt tame them and send them back to your camp. What you‚Äôre thinking of is pacifying them, which just makes them not aggressive. Which doesn‚Äôt really matter because they don‚Äôt attack you lol. 
---
Yeah, still haven't seen the first movie. I also want  to roleplay with the (seemingly rare) "sack hood", a plaid long sleeve shirt, and a good legendary pickaxe.
---
Chances are they will refer your case straight to homeland security.  Only reason they havn't banned you yet is the extensive background checks into your family and they fact that your face is on a cork board full of yarn trying to find the source of your duped item. 
---
What does the white powder jump suit look like? I looked it up but didn‚Äôt see any pictures that I think fit that description. 
---
It's working all the time 50% of time
---
Charisma has a 7% damage perk. Adrenaline increases damage after kills. Bloody mess 15%. So much to stack to get decent damage out of heavies while .50 and Gatling Gun are the only 2 even worth picking up. Its a painful like but I enjoy it.
---
I don't see how you were griefing; you were playing a role and so were they.  That's the game.  Although this did read sort of like a hostage note -- did they capture you and hold you hostage on their stream?  Blink twice if you want 50 guys in PA to nuke the site from orbit.
---
Did you de-focus the mob, wait a second, and check again?  
---
As others have said, it's bugged. But it takes a minute for it to hit the LEgendary pool. It's like when you go to look at your purifier or a mailbox and you just get the swirly for 10-15 seconds.
---
So you felt bad about PVP'ing in a  PVPVE game?
---
Get over it, if people want to moan let them, the game is geared around PVP though. If you attack some one it is not grieving as this sub seems to like to make out.
---
So what if they moan or bitch or tell everyone around them that people shouldn't play the game how Bethesda intended because they don't like it?
---
Should have killed them all burnt the base and left some salt in the brown bag, cant say your RP'in Jason if you don't actually kill anyone hey ;)
---
This happens to me often and I am just a stealth sniper rifle build.
---
To end it immediately you need to kill the enemy that triggered it otherwise it seems random as to how long it continues BUT it might be timed to how many AP you have left.
---
Why should I not be able to enjoy the nice things I have earned
---
?? Okay, when it's not working, what's wrong with it?
---
the building is new appalachian bank, in one of the safes you can find the  [faschnacht man mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Faschnacht_Man_mask)
---
Tse will still be 2 of the best damage boosts a weapon can get.
---
A bloodied gun with perks to back it up is stronger but there are costs involved there
---
You will find idiots out there.   Give them as little reaction as you can.  That is their only joy and you have the power to not give it to them.
---
I was battling the SBQ and my Gatling plasma broke but it glitched so I was able to use it the whole time and fired about 10 cores through it while it was "broken"
---
I loved Arma Wasteland.  I really would love Fallout Survival mode to pick up where that left off.
---
I agree whole heartedly with what you've said. I would love to remove fast travel, but I think it has to exist at some level, because there is a Perk for it that you can't just throw away. 
---
I would suggest fast travel only to:
---
1. C.A.M.P.
---
2. Workshops that you own.
---
3. Vault 76
---
4. Train Stations and optionally Red Rockets.
---
This would make getting around possible but would prevent the drop-in-and-kill war bands trolling all the levelling spots.
---
Probably not. Now ppl can't just mindlessly zerg it i bet
---
i accept the invites from randoms and they usually just leave the team once they fast travel to me, haven‚Äôt met a single griefer luckily and i‚Äôm lvl 110 
---
Some open-mic sneeze monster scared the shite out of me last night while I was sneaking around a forest shortly after escaping a too-high-level encounter.  
---
Yup +1 to the dupers cause dcs and crash more if you just run nuke zones and whitesprings. Those are hard areas for the server to compute constantly. 
---
However, most recent update made it terribly unstable for me, until I uninstalled and reinstalled. Must have gotten a bad file.
---
Also Targeting HUD is broken right now and i can say with 100% certainty causes crashes. 
---
**[PSA]** We will stat working on the ***Community patch notes*** as soon as we can get the files. We also plan to live stream our whole workflow for those that want to take a look in the inside of the engine and answer questions on how things work.
---
no fast travelling would make the game so super boring
---
Would make sense lore wise as ppl label everything that is bad as a duper
---
Because of griefers, caps are becoming worth less and less due to inflation, also just leave as soon as you get the notification 
---
We are getting some stuff in March. Not sure if its Vending though....
---
I'm TOTALY a-okay with this...

SBQ loot in a nutshell.
---
Do your research.  Don't be a idiot, its been mentioned many times, but clearly you are so stupid to lose all of those mods. Its your fault you lost them. Because you clearly lack the IQ to read that its been happening for a while and to be careful.
---
programmable mouse, mechanical keyboard, yes
---
Pointless anyone on PS4 nuking the queen as it is now. All that happens is you waste a shit load of ammo and then blue screen like I did again just 5 minutes ago. Time to uninstall this shite....
---
Did you give him 1?  Because if you did he's not gonna leave you alone now, he knows you got more.
---
The Matrix has you!
---
Why are you here if you hate the game and bethsda so much? If all you‚Äôre gonna do is bitch and complain about the game and how they are fixing it than why are you here? If you‚Äôre here to just rile people up or to complain and waste your time than the only person who needs a life here is you.

The Vaults alread have a theme 1 Crygonic Vault about Fauna restauration, 1 that will probably be flooded with gas and i dont rember the 3rd

We're still in an age where significant portions of the population call every phone an iPhone and every mp3 player an iPod.

I'm not holding my breath for intelligence from bandwagons.

So, whoever you are, you're really improving the quality of communication we're getting about all of this.  Your responses have been coming more often and feel more genuine than I've noticed since the game comes out.  Thanks!
---
I would trade all the piles of junk I've lost in various ways for the 1 piece of high level legendary chameleon armor that I lose from the stupid Mama Dulce's hopper bug that stole it.  I've lost massive amounts of bulked junk on my way to sell it at a vendor and gotten disconnected after dying.  I wasn't as angry as when that f-ing hopper at Mama Dulce's stole my chameleon armor.
---
The person that lost ultracite armor might know how I feel, except that ultracite armor can be made.  No one can "make" me a multi-star legendary piece of chameleon armor that actually has good armor stats.  Thankfully I had a backup piece of armor, but it's stats suck.
---
Caps? How do you get caps in that situation?
---
I'm not an EvE player. Was this market bottleneck the reason for that horrific wa that had a real-money cost?
---
I was told that strange creaking sound I kept hearing across the country was the sound of basement neck-beards hanging themselves over the loss of their dreadnoughts. 
---
Sweet. Lemme know if you find it or not. I can keep my eyes peeled for ya
---
Good to know I'm not the only one then lol
---
More fun when you come across an arguing couple.
---
Hearing the music when Mothman appears always makes me feel like I just stumbled across a rare Pok√©mon. 
---
Check under every tree where mutated ferns grow for flash fern if the mutated pitchers have already been picked.  I regularly pick up 40-50 violets with green thumb without much trouble
---
I'd also love more options for the keypad doors. Currently there's only brick, which is bugged, and wood. Metal and barn would be awesome. Keypad garage doors would be cool too. 
---
Could you possibly make mobs in the SBQ fight go after the players under lvl 25 first?
---
Just need anti armour weapons and perks and she goes down fast already.
---
As for low levels, I have yet to experience this on PS4 and I‚Äôve done a few SBQ fights now.
---
I tend to pick off the mobs with my lever action rifle then headshot her from stealth with my anti armour dragon.
---
Yes the TSE guys shred her health but one crit from my dragon moves her health bar significantly.
---
So I build crit with lever action (generally just use a clip even though meter is full after two shots) then use dragon, spend 10 seconds reloading wishing for the sweet release of death, repeat).
---
I have two xbox controllers we use for other games. Not a fan of them for FPS though. Neither of us are console players so the transition would be harder. 
---
To be absolutely fair, much of the above is official retcon.
---
Because, as of Fallout 2, my understanding was that Jet was, actually, a post war invention.  FO3 and forward needed a retcon. 
---
Interesting, wonder if there is a market for online rpg insurance...comprehensive home and life.
---
Yeah, and garage doors too! 
---
We will post them tomorrow when the game is down for maintenance. 
---
Hello Gary!
---
Thank you! I could not play the game so frustrated. I will give it a try. ü§©
---
To proove when someone actually makes a legitimate ppint on this game theyre downvoted and the comment hidden.
---
Thats the point i just made.
---
I'm not disagreeing with that. Just for the record,  I wasnt one of the ones complaining about the predetermined character/backstory in 3 or 4. But also, I realize that an online game is not the best place for that kind of whole world revolves around your character story. 
---
My main point though, was that you were making this argument that Bethesda was ignoring the old school fans like you, and catering entirely to the younger generation. But it's not really a old versus new split. Many of the old fans dislike the very thing that you are saying is missing. Others, like me, liked that part as well, but don't see it being missing from 76 as a problem. There are a lot of posts that go around saying things like "why is Bethesda doing 'x' when 'y' is what fans want" that completely fail to see that there are also fans that want 'x.'
---
You can‚Äôt get killed through slap damage in one shot. That‚Äôs been thoroughly disprove. It was most likely workshop related. 
---
Life saving armor I think would be best you can get vampires everything I have a vampires rocket launcher 
---
I believe it's the sound quality as opposed to the song choices.  Music comes in so terrible over mics that you can't really have a player based "radio station" unless there's a system like you said.
---
How  about  an   X on the compass for dead bodies?
---
Killing another player gets you caps, no matter how it's done, as long as you or a teammate get the killing blow
---
The bunker command center's been pretty reliable for me up through last night. I haven't been on yet today.
---
I just love all the delicate little butterflies that are commenting on here like just listen, at some point you will probably come across a duper and he will have a noice deal on a nice gun and you will buy it I‚Äôm not even gonna lie that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm level 65 so I don‚Äôt have any super crazy guns but I‚Äôve got a few that can get the job done prettyy good  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Me too 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure melee staggers fuck it up too. I was playing around with a guy with Sentinel gear, headshots with a decent rifle weren‚Äôt doing much to him, I smack him with a super sledge and he staggers back and loses like 50% of his health. 
---
I made the poor decision of putting my camp on the golf course at the Whitespring, so on more than one occasion I've spawned into a blast zone with no time to react if I'm being irradiated.  So stupid.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen whitesprings nuked for weeks lol.
---
So much so that I‚Äôm finally progressing through the main story on this character (level 140ish) because I‚Äôm starting to miss it.
---
Morgantown always has no legendaries for me...which sucks
---
Yah one of the real annoying inventory and stash management things while crafting. The one time I forget to move my mods I was saving for later out of my stash.... I bulk crafted some ammo and I lost six of them that I was holding onto and saving for later.  Oof.... 
---
I nuked this area yesterday (prior to seeing this post) based on some other suggestions I'd seen. It was interesting overall and I'm glad I did, though as everyone has already noted there were no legendaries. And I certainly didn't see the same number of glowing as the YouTuber did, but it wasn't terrible. Mostly just wanted to see something that wasn't Whitesprings or the Queen.
---
Can someone explain why I‚Äôm being down voted? Don‚Äôt be a dick and actually explain yourself 
---
One can dream. 
---
There are vampire weapons of every type! As far as armor goes the shadowed stuff and investing in sneak skills is about the best you can do. Maybe do the mistress of mysteries quest to get the improved stealth boys. Find a creepy mask too!! Sounds fun!
---
I know, right? Here's a shocker, but some of us are actually trying to complete the event, not farm legendaries.
---
Phoenix 
---
Would be awesome as a plan
---
To be fair, Fallout is hardly FPS. But then again, 76 is a bit fps-y. But I still like gamepads over kb/m, and I've never owned a console. I still find it easier to use vats with a gamepad though.
---
I;'ve got the sack hood, the one without durability and hoses
---
Haha, classic.  Plus he's also wearing a blue 76 leather jacket I assume.
---
Read my reply, sarcastic little forest troll 
---
&gt;Mostly crap
---
&gt;#**Sometimes useful plans**
---
&gt;More crap
---
That‚Äôs not 100% true. Unless there‚Äôs a workshop involved they‚Äôll only ever do slap damage to you. Pacifist prevents you from slapping back and going into full damage pvp. So in a way it does protect you as long as you‚Äôre not doing pvp oriented content. 
---
No problem! The forums are a bit more difficult as we don't have a flair on there so my responses can get buried, but I'm trying to comment on everything I can. Appreciate it :)
---
I'll check to see if that was one of the plans I picked up.  (I picked up some sort of laser gatling gun.)  If I can make it, I'll make it for you for free.  Hit me up if you see me online.  (Usually late evenings around 10pm MST / 12am EST.)
---
No problem. Also, I did delete game data and uninstall/reinstall prior to finding this. The last update gave me a bad file or something so no matter what I did I was always crashing. 
---
Also, for what it's worth, I replied to Bethesda telling them I found an issue with the Targeting HUD and I got told to contact Sony or my ISP.... yea I dont believe it is Sony's or my ISP fault an item in your game is bugged. 
---
Hey cupcake, I would hardly call it clickbait, players are trying to find places that are viable compared to whitesprings which is always full of players. It applies to people who give a shit, if you don't then don't click.
---
Lol nevermind phonix literally just sold them
---
Two shot will only do 25% more
---
Explosive will only do 25% more
---
That's 50% more.
---
If a DB shotgun level 45 has a base damage output of 115 damage, then the tee would make it 172.5 damage (without perk cards)
---
With perk cards, this can be dramatically increased up to around 250
---
Had this happen twice yesterday 
---
Our QA team tests all these things with each patch, she is still very much killable with the nerf.
---
Def clickbait. Not better than WS. That's clickbait. If you don't like my comment, don't reply. Apply the same logic you just told me to apply, lil girl.
---
I just go there for shotgun ammo the rewards for uranium fever are trash.
---
I enjoy fixing people's c.a.m.p.s when they aren't around. I figure they will never notice, but at least they will come to a fixed home... until i leave and they are attacked again. I also drop extra healing salves when i make too many for people near the overseers camp. I only hope that this disappearing bag bug will be fixed tomorrow. I don't fast travel for the reason of the bags staying, but if i walk like a little bit away from the bag and come back... it's usually gone, even when no players are around...kinda hope it's an invisible person taking it each time and not just disappearing into thin air...
---
You literally just reworded what I already said, what are you doing?
---
&gt;wherefore 
---
I don‚Äôt think that word means what you think it means.  
---
I have a furious gatling plasma. It's damage is considerably good, but it dies way to quickly
---
I‚Äôve been rocking the sack hood with straight jacket and a hook as the sash flinging the hash singing 
---
This might be asking for a lot but since they're legendarys how about they come with a history. Who has owned it, how many kills has it gotten. You could even do a "Rightful Owner" buff that unlocks some potential in the weapon once you hold the top stat on it.
---
Just a jumpsuit that says white powder on it
---
No that's cheating
---
Me too!!!
---
They sometimes dont touch the bag because of how much grief has been made
---
I have to make an alt, get to L 15 and sit at Watoga train station until they appeared.
---
I don't think they should nerf the two shot perk. It is an extra bullet, why should it do less damage than the first?
---
This thread does not provide a clear answer. The last messages indicate it is NOT working correctly, ANYONE can use the switch, even when not on your team. Which makes the idea of the pylon useless. Please provide some more information when you can.
---
A working tv. Robo broadcasts. 3dog live from dc.. or the presidential bunker. Gtav style with channels for live news or just old live news. Or something. 
---
I see so much about griefers postedhere  and I just haven‚Äôt experienced a single one ever, sure some people wanna fight, it‚Äôs understandable why some people want too, that‚Äôs no reason to freak out, but I haven‚Äôt once seen somebody being toxic just for the sake of it. This is a reddit boogeyman. ‚ÄúTrolls‚Äù are in every game and if you have to spend every second of your game cowering I guess they won
---
thank you
---
WHICH horrible war with a real-money cost?
---
There are multiple wars that have vaporized trillions and quadrillions of isk, isk which (at least in the past) COULD be purchased with real money (but not necessarily all of it).
---
Big league EvE players play big league games for big league stakes, and can lose big.
---
It's what makes EvE stories so compelling, in a way that a WoW raid just can't be 
---
No the entire purpose is hardcore multiplayer.
---
I know. I was waxing poetic.
---
Sounded better than *where are my moth damn handmade plans*?
---
Friday I did a "The Messenger" quest and the plans dropped as a reward.  I was level 111 at the time.
---
That's really odd on two things. Why would he care for 350. That's nothing.
---
Second, bleeding TSE shotgun?
---
Exactly what I did. Plan is only available in a certain level window.  Relogged 10 times, got 3 copies
---
there's a mod that makes paper bags glow any color you wish 
---
Sometimes when you use the recon scope, the diamond tracking icon stays floating over the dead body. Since it only happens sporadically, I kind of think it is a bug. But I have totally used this "bug" to find a body in the grass. Seems to me since there is already some existing mechanism to float a diamond, they could work around that. 
---
Or listen for the flies. Dead easy to spot once you are close enough to hear them. And the meat pile disappears whenever you loot it, making it easier to find the next time.
---
Doesnt work on dead robots or scorchbeasts, and sometimes even meaty enemies doesn't turn to meat piles for some reason. And other times there's a bunch of meat piles with nothing on them, but you can't loot them to make the meat piles go away. 
---
They could make the swarm of flies taller to make it more visible, and make the flies glow whenever the dead body contains either a legendary or some component you have marked. Maybe replace it with a lot of sparks and some smoke for non-meaty corpses.
---
Hmm I think you seem to misunderstand the examples I'm making. Lol
---
I speak of a game this decade in that example to demonstrate how the term has changed.  Referencing how rumors of fallout becoming a free game were circulated under the title of "fallout becomes f2p" rather than "fallout becomes free".  Fallout never had a subscription or charged monthly to pay, however, due to younger generations (kids) misunderstanding the term to just mean free, as they grow older that have redefined the word.  
---
It would only make sense to use a current example when making an example of a current phenomenon.  Originally, games that had monthly subscription were pay to play (which was every mainstream mmo for a long time).  Game with no monthly subscription were f2p. I use eso as an example of f2p model because you still have to buy the main game and originally they had a subscription as well.  So by the original definiton it's f2p with no subscription to play yet it is not "free" because the main game still costs money.   The distinction between free and free 2 play is now lost on current gamers.  That's the point and it relates to the OP in that "dupers" now means all sorts of "cheaters" to this generation also lol  
---
"all these things".  but not sliding the number of items to 1 and having it go back to the top.
---
In underwear and no ones killling you. 
---
Mercy for the insane. Or theyve been baited before. Happened to me. It was funny in retrospect 
---
Graham, I dont remember them being all that expensive.
---
Just a heads up, the those doors work in the dumbest way possible. They are as broken as they can possibly be while still being functional (it takes some figuring out.
---
First off, (for the brick set at least) the keypad is on the "inside" wall, so you need to have floors on either side of the edge to snap it to, if you want to have the keypad facing outside (because why would you want to have to unlock the door from the inside to get out?)
---
There are two electrical connections, one powers the keypad, that wire connection is hidden, its above the doorway. 
---
The second connection is the switch on the back, which *you cannot activate by itself even though it looks just like the other wall switches* you need to connect a different switch to that switch. Recommend a pressure plate, since that has a momentary delay, meaning the door will shut behind you.
---
The "switch" on the back that is part of the wall will flip on for a few seconds after you enter the code, then turn itself off, shutting the door. You have to power that switch from the other side to get out (or in, as bethesda so intelligently designed it).
---
If you use a wall switch, youll need to walk through the door, turn around, and turn that switch off to close the door. The problem I ran into with the pressure plates is (currently) they cant be placed on the upper floors for some god damn reason. I had to put a camp fire down on the floor, then put the pressure plate on that to have an exit from my 3rd floor, because... bethesda
---
You probably have to wait for them to refresh.
---
The child must die......you will become more powerful than the normies could possibly imagine.
---
For any journalists reading this, firstly, go fuck ya mother you suck, secondly the messages contained whithin this back and forth are 100% super cereal.......just like manbearpig. Todd Howards bloodlust is only satisfied by either multiple cross platform purchases of Skyrim or blood of the innocent.....these are facts 
---
Melee or ranged? Happends alot with Melee havent seen it with ranged.
---
If I one shot from stealth they drop nothing more often then not.
---
For legendaries I exit stealth (if it‚Äôs something I can one shot), tag them in the body once or twice.  Let their health regenerate.  Then crit head shot them.
---
They drop a legendary then...usually a 3 Star board but i did get a three star exploding western revolver yesterday...pity I‚Äôm a rifle build and using it effectively would mean redistributing special points.
---
Oh well, my first exploding weapon
---
Thank you. I hope that is the case. 
---
Currently I see her die maybe 3/10 times on average even with multiple OP TSEs firing on her. 
---
How about an option to pay off your own bounty immediately?  If you refuse, then you get wanted status....
---
Close the game then re-launch it. Sometimes you get phantom items that pop up in your inventory when they aren‚Äôt actually there that mess with crafting 
---
You won't be. All the hype is just witch-hunting bullshit. Bethesda doesn't care if you purchase a good gun for 150 caps. 
---
You are not an educated person. 
---
Yup.  I had my camp there on the junk pile for a while.
---
Also, grab his gametag and hire a bounty hunter to grief him back...
---
Lucky you - I‚Äôve had my camp or a friend‚Äôs destroyed nearly every day I‚Äôve played over the past couple weeks. You stay there long enough the assholes notice you‚Äôre in the same place for too long, letting them know you‚Äôre likely in your camp. Then when they‚Äôre finished a friend kills them and you can‚Äôt collect a bounty. 
---
The fastest I‚Äôve been able to leave the server was about five tse shotgun blasts in, which destroyed a good portion of my crops and the entire from of my house. I‚Äôm glad you haven‚Äôt had to deal with the scumbag crowd in this game, but there are quite a few douchebags playing this game. 
---
You can also find the mask in the Asylum
---
It was Goris, but Garys' not a bad name Lol
---
Now finally here is a good suggestion. I would be fine with bicycles or other mechanical modes of transit even. A dirt bike would be dank AF.
---
Ok no problem
---
damn I'm on pc
---
Compared to who you? The guy with the "mothman." From a d rate video game tahhed after his name? Please.
---
Never played Destiny, do they have a combo system?  Primer‚Äî&gt; Detonator, then each class has an individual buff from participating? 
---
If you accidentally shoot someone or their stuff then you‚Äôre going to be in trouble regardless.
---
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to shoot his car your honour, it was an accident I swear...‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou shot it 117 times‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI had a finger cramp‚Äù
---
Take a look at my last post 
---
Finished a SBQ nuke yesterday. I was looting for about 20 minutes and my carry weight was almost 700 over my capacity. I was walking slowly towards a part of the map I hadn't been to before that had a building I could see in the distance. I got near it and all of a sudden another player runs up to me and shoots me about 100 times in a row (I had pacifist enabled so it didn't really do anything). He then gives me the thumbs down, jumps up into what I realize is his base, turns the Siren on full blast and keeps shooting me. I wave, and slowly shamble away for about a quarter mile, all the while he's running behind me, shooting me, waiting for me to get a ways away, then running back up and shooting me. It was bizarre. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. 
---
My friend's and I prefer blasting "WE ARE NUMBER ONE" from lazy town at people when we group gank.
---
I like to hope that it takes some of the sting out of the experience.
---
Are you seriously comparing this game to real life? Kindly delete your account
---
No... but that being said if someone was going to remake 76 in 4 as a MOD.......
---
You know it's only there in this sub right? Lol. Solid comeback though, Turd. You're a real gem.
---
I remember when I told people they would have issues bringing up cases against Bethesda because they didn‚Äôt get the perfect picture in their heads.  Should‚Äôve saved those comments to link this to them 
---
Make an alt power lv to 15 go to Harper's ferry the server hop til it pops...
---
You're welcome
---
(Took me like 4 hops to get it in my alt)
---
I so desperately want to officially call my instigating power attack war drum "The Bitch Slap" (with a capital "T"). 
---
I have one with the exact same effects that I got yesterday.
---
Weird
---
The Pokemon Go subreddit is worse, but it's kinda bad here too
---
At lvl 15 i did one single trip to Harpers Ferry, and it was there at vendor. 
---
Same here.  [Here](https://i.imgur.com/LpxJlZD.jpg) is the map with the levels of enemies in each area.  I‚Äôve pretty much just been basing my early game (lvl 1-50) off of it.  Pretty frustrating that I can barely play with my friends that are only 10-15 levels higher than me because of the higher levels.
---
Justify how pitiful you are whatever way you want. Dossent change it.
---
Delete your life
---
The ice chest is chock-full of one-star shite.  Have at it, low-level peeps.  Most that have been playing for a while don‚Äôt need the caps...
---
And it would actually take all of your budget
---
Oh this community is the worst I've ever seen. It is the most childish, self entitled, pitiful, whiny bunch of idiots ever. Worse than destiny, worse than CoD, BY FAR
---
I guess nuke the queen just right to give room for a nuke free zone while still having the queen fly around. 
---
A half sized garage door would be cool.
---
If I notice a new player (LVL1-3) on the map, I usually check and see if they want a 'welcome package' with some diluted stims, bobby pins, and a few useful bulks. Either that or I'll drop a bunch of helpful stuff in Overseer's Camp.
---
Also, as an unfortunate IRL and digital packrat, if I find any useful higher-level gear, I tend to keep it til I find another player that wants it.
---
found plans for one in a duffel bag
---
For what it's worth, you don't have to read the diary. Just go by the creamery and pick it up.
---
It is still frustrating that you have to get it again though. Maybe that was always the intent, but:
---
1. You have now spoiled me, Bethesda, and I have become lazy;
---
2. At least let me type the password in, like with the pin pads. I know what the password is! Because I've read it on the damn note 14 times.
---
Unfortunately intelligence isn't something is tested before making an account on here. I here you though brother. 
---
I‚Äôve been farming stealthboyz until March; but, yeah you can still see my silhouette.
---
Or you just shoot in a random direction &amp; i end up being in that crossfire 
---
The Dev team is aware of that issue and it's being addressed in a future update. 
---
10 year olds can do better than that, try again
---
I'M SO ANGRY.  
---
Just chill mate.  Don't play the game if you don't like it.  Cut your losses and move on.  
---
Sneak when you're at your camp (so you don't reveal your camp location on the map), and take a moment to check the map for large bounties. If you block them, they can't track you anymore.
---
It'd used both ways though. Some griefers will block victims so they can't see them coming.
---
Pivot and look behind you and it should clear.  This was the fastest way I've found to get back to normal.
---
When it's not working, I have a feeling like it might be working someday again, and it makes me nervous.
---
Found the 13 year old. Someone alert their mum that they're lost.
---
I was hoping not to have to do that. The whole trusting a stranger to transfer stuff doesn't sit well?
---
I've closed my game and hard restarted at least 10 times already, but it still doesn't work. Thank you though.
---
Pro tip, vampires on shotuns apply to all pellets. Same with vampires harpoon if you put fletchettes on it. 
---
My friend got a vampires explosive shotgun and it heals her from 10% to full in one shot. 
---
Its a very overlooked effect.
---
what platform?
---
I agree with you, but i did post this hours before you posted as advocate for accessibility. Hard to argue with posts from the future.
---
Unlikely you most likely provoked the community with another annoying and pointless thread. Quoting youtubers, linking their videos or claiming 76 is trash instead of giving anything of value is again gonna irk all of us.
---
Instead if your write up what you like , dislike and what you would like to see changed or added then it will be upvoted.
---
I dislike some things in 76 , even called Beth hard out on the exploits and so on but i wrote them up in a way the community could see my points. But i always offer tonnes of feedback to help improve the game as well.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to avoid having to do that. Don't know many people in game who i can get to transfer.
---
I would say 3/4 at most
---
My mum has passed, you are very welcome to "alert" my father that I asked a question on the internet.
---
XBox
---
Do you feel better now that you've insulted my intelligence? What is it that you feel you've gained by calling me names and saying I lack the IQ to read? Incidentally IQ and reading ability don't have an awful lot to do with each other - you can have a very low IQ but still be able to read.
---
You clearly lack the ability to understand that I know it's an issue, I have taken steps to try and avoid it, but when the glitch occurs at a time when there's no indication of where the scrap being used is coming from, and you have ample scrap of that type available so you have no reason to expect that the game is scrapping your mods to provide materials you already have, there really is no way to avoid falling foul of this. Short of temporarily putting your mods in an open-world container every time you want to build something.
---
 Btw - an\* idiot, It's\*. You're welcome.
---
I actually read that and heard it in my head lol
---
Lol that‚Äôs most likely why they‚Äôre making us suffer. 
---
Stop, you're making me sad
---
That's too bad.
---
Found the 13 year old. Someone alert their da that they're lost.
---
Nothing like coming across a Scorched wielding a minigun in one hand like it weighs the same as a feather-duster, flailing it around like nothing. 
---
You raise some very good points there.  But, personally, I still don't miss the human NPCs.
---
automatic railway rifle is also hilarious in pvp 
---
All jokes aside, we are planning on doing live streams! Let us know what kind of play-through's you'd like to see. 
---
Wow. Don't know if even the handmade plans would be worth that. :/
---
You've struck source! Going to rake them caps in!
---
I‚Äôd hate to be the Bethesda employee who is reading suggestions at work and stumbles upon this comment section. I can imagine  Todd Howard looking over their shoulder baffled by what his Fallout community thinks of him lol. 
---
Came across a player on top of the Whitespring Hotel playing Johnny Cash music while sniping ghouls.
---
Imagine being the problem but somehow not realizing it.
---
Yah that would be my complaint too. I love the radio channels and the thematic music selections that they usually have.... But why does the radio iin 76 have so few songs? Why does the radio have so few channels (assuming others in the area are left automated also)? There needs to be a lot more songs for an online mmo game, even more than you'd put into a single player game, imho. 
---
I understand music licensing and stuff, but I did kinda wish they would've rounded up all past fallout music soundtracks and put them in this game to give that illusion of how the radio airwaves were playing all these same songs through the years, echoing into the void of time. Maybe modding will help on this front soon.
---
In the urinal at that.
---
I like these rewards better than enclave and bos. I don't use power armour or automatic weapons (I know that's just be but hey - everyone needs a reason to fight) 
---
If I have to leave in 20min finish the quest later when you have more time so you can actually benefit from your nuke.
---
Points 2 and 3 are what ive been believing to be the case for some time now, good to see some confirmation on it!
---
I use shotguns on scorchbeats to make them land (or if im lucky, cripple their head so they stop sonic blasting me). Even tho the shotty does jackshit for damage at the range the SBs fly at, ive still seen success with them landing pretty quickly as long as it makes contact.
---
I'm interested in this as well as my base unbuffed but mutated Int is 20. Do I need to keep a stack of berry mentats and other aid items on hand to max crafting or am I already at effective max?
---
I don't really farm for them but find them pretty regularly in random places and quite often find one or two a day and have gotten none in two days...just figured it was bad luck or because I started using that luck perk while using alcohol but who knows
---
I'll help ya
---
whew.....so me and my 999 guns are a.o.k.  Sweet Baby Jesus the relief.  
---
I'm not the PvP audience either but I really like your idea - a hardcore mode should have consequences, and decisions.  In addition to the carry weight being a hard cap, I'd even consider reducing the stash capacity for Survival mode.  Only the absolute necessities, no hoarding, decisions, decisions!  Perks that would cause you to be over the limit can't be removed, so drop stuff before you can drop the perk.
---
I made 2 generalisations. "This game, I'm sorry to say, was marketed at the younger "shoot and run" generation, instead of the diehard Fallout fans like me." And no 2
---
"but they aren't thinking of the old faithfuls like me" both generalisations ended with "like me" so I'm talking from my point of view. They weren't really generalisations, they were comments from my point of view about people like me, and there are a lot of people like me who feel the same, you just have to read the comments above. As for lumping you into the older generation like me, you must not be like me. (he says tongue in cheek with a wink).
---
This reminds me of the first time I found the screaming cabins. I was completely caught off-guard and thought someone was screaming in their mic for help! 
---
Sounds like you are already at max for crafting purposes.
---
That's actually the very point.
---
You created a post whining that everyone else was wrong and you somehow had a valid opinion. But if that were true then we wouldn't be here, now would we? :)
---
Not all internet posts go over swimmingly. You'll get used to it. Trying to quote some YouTuber isn't really going to make your opinion more palatable or valid.
---
This! But still happy to help. 
---
Sandbox = Make your own fun 
---
We started a cult to reginald the bronze lion in my friends base and in my base is Sloth Hunters Anonymous 
---
I just want to take one second to acknowledge the work you guys have put into this game sense you might read these comments. All your probably going to be reading in these comments is whining and arguing so I just want to take a second and say thank you for taking our ideas into consideration and fixing problems we have been noticing. Honestly this game angers me a lot at times but I still play. It‚Äôs just so fun. The whole game is just a masterpiece and if it was issue free, oh my god there is no telling how awesome this game would be. The only thing I‚Äôm thinking would be cool would be a post I read the other day about more realistic things in the atomic shop. I have like 5000 atomic points (some I‚Äôve bought some I‚Äôve earned) and I can‚Äôt find much I want to buy. It would be cool to have some more vintage or raider stuff in the atomic shop. I have the splatter paint for my metal armor and everyone I come buy Ooo‚Äôs and Ahhhh‚Äôs when they see it. That‚Äôs got to be one of my best purchases. 
---
I found it at a train station vendor last night in south part of the map
---
My vats works fine. Except for that delay you need to wait to get a "lock on".
---
I do miss at times, even several high chance shots. But generally it seems to work fine.
---
They definitely have various buffs from abilities. Have not played since the early days of D2 so i can't say about primers/detonators but i didn't see anything just like that in my time. 
---
One thing I've seen about primers/detonators in Anthem is they require a lot of precise teamwork to make use of. In my time with Destiny i learned that matchmaking can make that level of teamwork hard to achieve even when you end up with people trying their hearts out. Lots, maybe even most people tend to play without headphones, so you can end up with no real communication besides emotes or some guy frustratingly trying to coordinate things since he's the only one able to talk. 
---
I know a guy that sold a legendary hunting rifle for a full set of assasin/sentinel.
---
I‚Äôm staying away from those guys in survival, but I do have a chance if they‚Äôre not standing still &amp; i come behind with stealth thanks to the stealth perk &amp; bobble head.  
---
Tesla rifle is pretty decent
---
I did screenshot his gamertag. Anyone on XBox willing to hunt him down and destroy his camp pm me. I am at work right now but i'll get back to you late tonight or tomorrow night
---
cool build, but that bridge hasn't been maintained in at least 25 years, no way I'm risking a collapse...
---
The only problem would actually be the Fast Traveling because of how the game is designed, a few things are made with Fast Traveling ( or at least a faster method of travel ) in mind, and seeing how there currently are no vehicles it would be a lot more taxing on newer players to create defenses on workshops that can actually defend against higher tier players. 
---
As with number 6, those massive turrets found within some workshops should be decimating for players, they should be able to shred armor, and cause massive limb damage if not instant death from being shot in the mouth. These turrets appear to fire very high caliber bullets and only the strongest of armors would be able to even survive a hit from one of these monstrosities
---
Time to stock up on whisky and mutfruit and convert some regular mentats into grape ones then.
---
&gt;Oh this community is the worst I've ever seen. It is the most childish, self entitled, pitiful, whiny bunch of idiots ever. Worse than destiny, worse than CoD, BY FAR
---
There's a quote from this very thread, now go back to sucking bethesda's dick and drinking the liquid shit that is Fallout 76
---
You made my Fallout 76 heart happy with these. I especially love that you included IRL &lt;-&gt; game shots for each spot. Great stuff! :-D 
---
I just hop on discord, there‚Äôs usually better teammates on their than the randoms from matchmaking
---
Overencumbered\*
---
They'd have zero if new characters are a requirement - and if Bethesda still haven't wiped characters with those with 300 TSE handmades yet, shame on them too!
---
You had me at whisky.
---
How could he tell i was low HP?  Actually no clue.   Up into that point, I hadn't said anything to him and honestly not sure if you can see the hp of someone not grouped.  
---
Regardless, he plopped a bag of stims down for me.  I returned the favor as quick as i could with some cryo grenades.
---
Sounds fake, is it credible ? Doesn't sound like the language of a credible law firm ..
---
That opinion sucks, too. Because you've found two crappy opinions it does not make a valid opinion.
---
Now go back to being a 13 year old.
---
Everytime I've done this fight (probably only 10 times or so), the Queen had gone down in about 5-10 mins... Maybe it's a good thing to make it harder, this game lacks any meaningful endgame challenges from my perspective. If anything the loot table should be improved and the fight should be even harder.
---
I think you meant deuce? 
---
The damn deucers are sepsr than the dupers.
---
My game has crashed over a hundred times since the BETA ended. I've had challenges and achievements not finish. I've been kicked out of a server while trying to do the same quest four times in a row while on the last step and had to start over each time. Bethesda doesn't care about that stuff. I've posted nuuumerous times about the crap I've seen in this game. It's fun, but it is literally the most broken, buggy game that I have ever played, in over 20 years of gaming. 500 atoms for the canvas bag fiasco? None of us are getting atoms for in-game mechanics. 
---
Lmao 
---
Whenever I have excess plans that neither I nor my friends can use, I run over to the Overseer's Camp and drop them (and other useful stuff) in the trunk there. 
---
I got the one near the portable toilets and dumpster in the parking area of the battlefield cemetery that is south of Pricketts.
---
I've killed it before in the past, no idea what made it any different this time.
---
Yeah come on. Let's get it
---
I duped my balls in your mom.
---
Sorry that's toxic 
---
Look up fallout 76 on metacritic or just any review site XD thank you, next.
---
Yeah come to think of it I used to get them regularly. As of late I haven‚Äôt got one. 
---
oh shit, didnt think about that... might have to put up some support soon 
---
Me too.  GT same as reddit name.  I understand the whole transfer thing, thats why I still do it the hard way.
---
Not sure if you misspelled that on purpose for your comment or if you're for real haha
---
"Griefer" has a better ring to it than "slight inconveniencer". 
---
was handing some stimpacks and plans off one character to a friend to swap to another character - guy runs up screaming something about dupers grabs the bag on the ground (only 1 spoiled fruit in it) then shoots me twice throws a grenade at my friend and were just standing there like.......
---
so he pulls a tse Guass rifle and I pull a two shot fatman..... lets say it went down hill from there for him
---
Wine isn‚Äôt hard alcohol sir/ma‚Äôam. Also, this was over 2 months ago, how did you get this deep?
---
Once again, you've found something that you think validates you. But it clearly does not in the audience you've decided to tell to go back to performing oral sex on Bethesda.
---
This all sounds very 12 year old. Were you not being truthful when I called you 13?
---
It does. I had 2 guys in whitesprings baiting people with bounties. I rolled up on them with a supersledge and shut their party down.
---
Looks like some triggered children downvoted you. sorry :(
---
Lolz that‚Äôs not improving yours or anyone‚Äôs perception 
---
Nice, I've had a few that killed or turned on me when they got attacked 
---
The best is getting called a hacker because the pvp in this game is so buggy and shitty that sometimes people just don't take damage and other times they die in two hits.  I've had to apologize sometimes after I killed someone because some bullshit happens and they call me a hacker so I tell them I don't even know what the fuck happened there, Bethesda just made a shitty game.
---
There is a tin foil hat theory that our characters are actually in some kind of vault simulator, mostly based on "nothing is real" being written in random locations across the map. Again, just a theory, but it is odd that code would turn up as a texture... dun dun DUN!
---
What system you play on
---
If I had 3 I'd be king of the server in no time 
---
I'm 15, but thanks. Next.
---
Just tried it and it worked, thank you very much I appreciate it! :)
---
I'd to see a hydration counterpart, or additional bonus to Cannibal that allows a chance to harvest bloodpacks from enemies, that way  it can have synergy with Bloodsucker, and I can really start feeling like I'm well on my way to becoming a Wendigo.  
---
While still talking about food, there is one idea for a perk I had fitting in with the concepts of Good Doggy, Bloodsucker, and Cola Nut.
---
Wasteland Gourmet. Two ranks. You gain twice/triple the benefits from complex dishes (made with more than 3 ingredients) and drinks made at a food station.  This means just cooking some mutt chops or Ribeye steak doesn't give double benefits from making it, because you're just throwing it in the fire, same with basic juice or tea for drinks that just needs boiled water, wood, and the berry or flower.
---
Theres is the nocturnal weapon which does more damage at night
---
Whatever you need to ease your conscious man. You‚Äôre like those schmucks that abuse sporting equipment then return it when they lose interest.  
---
Ah, underdeveloped 15 year old calling people 12 year olds. That makes sense.
---
They're constantly for sale on the trade subs for between 750-1,500 caps.
---
 Hell of  lot easier to spend one days vendor runs on them than to dick around with all that.
---
Only other recommendation I have is to place all junk in your stash then close and relaunch and then pick it all back up 
---
I ran into him very recently too, but he attacked me so I had to take him out
---
Lack of end game, lol, what do you want exactly
---
A duper looter 
---
Both sound like good ideas, how about adding in an option to a connected terminal to change the code as well?
---
You can thank me by building me mine (kidding). I still need 35 more screws, 5 nuclear, waste, etc., etc.
---
Did your friend take it and sell it all off?
---
Maybe you and others have used this in the past without an issue 
---
But the fact is there are roving bands of asshats looking for an excuse to embrace their inner asshole.
---
I‚Äôll pass until the survival mode becomes production environment 
---
Thanks, next.
---
Don't listen to OP‚Äîhe's trying to dupe you.
---
Exactly I love the community. It make the game 10x more fun. 
---
I always just rolled the dice on matchmaking. Kinda sad when you really click with your team and everyone just goes their way at the end because you're just random people to each other. 
---
How would you like to buy a 3\* Vampire's Powerfist?
---
I always cycle to the Misc tab and none of my weapons, armor, or ammo can show up there, just the canister. Good work around until/if they fix it.
---
This. Haha, I wish I could set the code but I have to keep placing and storing the door until I get a code I like. 
---
That's awesome. I believe you. I had a guy running around in Whitesprings with his mic on running into each cabin individually and going "OH FUCK THEY'RE HERE" every single time. He was completely alone - to this day I still wonder if he was playing and other people were watching him. 
---
Lol. All I read was you acknowledging knowing what game you're playing, and then trash fortnite, make a gross generalization about it's player base, make assumptions of who you believe this other person to be, and then call them a duper based on no proof.
---
Griefers want you to act this way. You're just making everyone happier the saltier you get.
---
Is that a real perk? And what level is it unlocked?
---
Yeah to be fair Bethesda shouldn't have called their "hardcore PvP" mode "Survival" because that implies something different.
---
I'm more or less saying 76 Survival should be like 4 Survival, albeit with unforgiving multiplayer.
---
Why should you expect to enjoy things in a post-apocalyptic wasteland?
---
This is what I though of seeing that picture:
---
[Chriiiiiss!!](https://youtu.be/0ca0GynQFSs) 
---
People bother to lock extractors???
---
Believe me, I've thought about it. 
---
But, at this point, it's almost personal.
---
Handmade plans are my white whale. Don't know if it would give the same accomplishment if I have to use an alt or buy them.
---
And even if they won a gagillion dollars, you‚Äôd see $0.05, while they took home millions.
---
&gt; Instead if your write up what you like , dislike and what you would like to see changed or added then it will be upvoted.
---
To a point, it's best to do a search of the past week to see if this topic has been mentioned. Some are being repeated *ad nauseum*. If people are frequent, daily readers they will not like the same thing brought up for the umpteenth time. 
---
Also, nothing out of the world, hyperbolic in terms of requests. There was a satire thread where someone pointed these things out. 
---
Sucks that you live in California
---
It's the same law firm that made the news with their announcement on investigating Bethesda for "deceptive trade practices".
---
I remember looking around on their [website](http://www.classlawdc.com/2018/11/26/bethesda-game-studios-deceptive-trade-practices-investigation/) \- they seem pretty reputable. 
---
While I agree with a lot of the op's suggestions, a bigger question for me is whether or not fo76 is a good platform for a hardcore pvp game in the first place.  I don't know the answers but some obvious questions:  
---
* Multiple damage mitigation perks and items that stack.  Is that a good idea for fun and balanced pvp?
---
* The current legendary items and effects and the EXTREME rarity of the best effect combinations.  Is that a good idea for fun and balanced PvP?
---
* The weapon balance and relative uselessness of energy weapons and heavy weapons.  Is that a good idea for fun and balanced PvP?
---
* If assasins/sentinels armor is a prerequisite to being able to compete you have yourself a poorly balanced PvP game.  If players have to "farm" these items in adventure mode before ever going into survival mode is that a good idea for fun and balanced pvp?
---
* How many builds are viable for PvP?  If it's only a small number, is that a good idea for fun and balanced PvP?  
---
Maybe all of the above is fine, maybe not.  If not, what then?  
---
What playtesting has gone into making PvP balanced?  if it isn't extensive, how good of an idea is it to just charge forward with survival mode?  
---
I foresee 2 outcomes:
---
1. you continue on the current path and wind up with your playerbase at each others THROATS because the survival players will demand nerfs to certain things they view as OP but the adventure players will oppose 100% of those changes because in their PvE focused game those nerfs don't make sense.
---
2. To avoid or resolve the above you will need to completely separate the 2 modes so everything works differently in the 2 modes.  Some legendary effects, perks, chems, bobbleheads, magazines etc might even have to be removed or radically overhauled for survival mode effectively making 2 separate games.
---
Personally if it was my decision I'd just change one thing: make it clear survival mode is a BETA, and that while all are welcome to test the beta after it's done a server wipe for survival will be performed.  This way if you wind up needing 2 versions of the game so survival isn't a shit show you can make those changes without screwing your entire playerbase.
---
It was a joke btw 
---
Honestly all it takes is about a minute of browsing his post history to see why he's reacting the way he is. Funny how just about every thread like this can be traced back to piss poor presentation of an opinion or feedback.
---
Bingo!
---
Same here. I‚Äôll help lowbies lower then myself if we‚Äôre in area event or they‚Äôre getting mobbed by npcs. 
---
but, I‚Äôll pass on the highbies looking to team
---
I have killed level 68 ghouls and gotten level 35 gear. I think that is what op is saying, but I may be wrong.
---
Appreciate it. I might randomly hit you up, I'll have to  level an alt first.
---
Sorry, I thought so too. Then I had a bag like that disappear as soon as I exited the transfer screen so this is not a safe method
---
I just wish I could pick up the whole building and move it a foot.
---
Happens to me all the time in melee. 
---
You can add my IGN: Savage_Dog
---
and just start your RP of being a member of the BoS
---
but not all weapons in a class should be top tier either....
---
No, I am positive that he hasn't.  We have been friends for 30+ years, and it just isn't like him.
---
Besides, why strip one character and leave all the goodies on the others?
---
I am assuming I got caught by some bethesda script looking for dupers, but all I ever get when contacting support is "we can not help you".
---
1. Because spending a few hours playing a game and coming to tell people that have spent months playing it that their opinion is melodramatic when one has absolutely no context for their experience makes one look like a tool.
---
2. Because sometimes "opinions" are extremely biased, to the point of ignoring/dismissing facts. There are people on both sides of this coin.
---
Heads just wants the game to fail, and doesn't care that changes have been made and the game is in a better place now than it was 2 months ago.
---
Tails takes any criticism of the game as a personal attack and isn't willing to acknowledge that the game does have issues on multiple fronts. These issues need to be addressed both for the health of this game and the health if the gaming industry as a whole, and pretending like they're not there does nothing but make one feel better about how they're spending their time.
---
This covers most of the situations I've seen here. Yeah, there are some dicks here, just like everywhere else on the internet, but there are some people who simply aren't posting in good faith, whether they know it or not.
---
And your opinion has any kind of merit to it? An opinion is an opinion, you have the rational thinking of half of a dead mouse. No opinion is valid in everyone's eyes as fact, that's why it's an opinion. You want reasoning for someones opinion then you turn around and say "that opinion sucks too", you're no better
---
I imagine in the middle of the cork board there is a silhouette of someones head with a question mark over it labeled "Mr. Big"
---
Enforcer rocks. Seriously. Even without the two-shot explodey thing. 
---
For fun, try it on a Gulper sometime. Le one and get the best flipperdefloppy animation in the game. Epileptic flop seizure.
---
I had some but I figured being able to be invisible is more vampish. I also have the chameleon mutation so I'm hoping a full set of armour with that will make me able to be pretty much completely invisible?
---
Condition (over 100% can affect damage), or some chems / drinks / perk cards you may have not realized changed.  
---
do you have adrenal reaction as a mutation? or any bloodied pistols?
---
Look at the comments in your thread, this is exactly what I'm talking about
---
PRAISE BE TO MOTHMAN
---
or ... make it so any players lower than 40 receive no loot
---
I‚Äôm on pc. Sorry.
---
I think the game absolutely needs friendly npcs. Every quest, every holotape, every note and every town is ultimately meaningless. Spoiler alert for all quests: They dead.
---
Beyond that, with only 24 players on a server, it begs the question of how we are supposed to rebuild civilization. We came from a vault filled with the best and the brightest with the goal of repopulating and rebuilding the world. Where the hell is everyone else, and why did we all scatter to become wandering murder-hobos? 
---
If every other 76 dweller died, where are their bodies? The other dead dwelers are from vault 90-something. Did they all just leave Appalachia? 
---
Besides that, I find myself learning about the Responders, the Firebreathers, the Free States and I keep thinking to myself "boy, they seem interesting. I wish I was playing THAT game." The stories of dead people are more interesting and engaging than what we are actually playing.
---
As for npcs vs bug fixes... that is a frankly stupid either/or. They have different teams working on different projects and content. Unless you think say the artists and writers should drop what they are doing and start coding and programming. You could argue that more npcs = more bugs, but that is true for all content. More content = more bugs, more guns = more bugs, more bugfixes = more bugs!
---
As for not knowing how to handle multiple people around npcs, or killing quest givers, well, this aint new territory. Multiplayer games have had npcs for a very long time, and usually tend to work. You could have designated safe towns where you cant attack or nuke the area. You could have npcs unkillable or even killable. It is kind of hard to grief when you can just server hop until you find some living npcs. Inconvenient sure, but welcome to multiplayer. Gaming. Real life. Reality. Whatever, lots of things are made inconvenient by other people but you have to get over it.
---
My buddy and I have this problem all the time too. I'm on a X, he's on a S. We are both usually wearing the Excavator armor
---
Nice build. I'm directly above you on the rocks http://imgur.com/gallery/806clCH
---
We definitely need the ability to personalize our weapons again. I miss my ".Wesley Sniper Rifle" and ".PowerFist5000" (the dots to force favorites to the top of the list). I think for trading purposes, it would be best to make it so it has a personalized name and a subtitle of the original name. So like:
---
# Tittysprinkles
---
mutant slayer‚Äôs full automatic hardened 50. Cal ghost recon NV scoped x50 10mm submachine gun 
---
That or have the name automatically change back when traded.
---
I saved up 100 salt for a silly post here about salty people.
---
I got called a duper lol
---
I believe Bethesda's official stance on the duped items that have been distributed is: "We don't give af! Thug Life!"
---
Are you also 15? The opinion from a 15 year old that everyone else is "triggered" 12 year olds is ridiculous. For you to defend it is... uh... maybe you should reevaluate why you're here.
---
It takes a certain kind of full blown idiot to use words like "triggered" for people who find their post distasteful or inappropriate. You'll understand some day that it isn't a matter of a "right opinion", as that makes no sense, but more about communication in general.
---
I raise you:

More then 1 boss xD 
---
Offer him 1399 and meet at 1499.  
---
Rule 1: Never pay asking price.
---
Rule 2: Put 9s in your offers to visually inflate the value
---
Rule 3: Half up front, the rest after delivery
---
Rule 4: Value is intrinsic, are you going to flip the gun or enjoy hours of use?
---
In my opinion tho, its not worth it, unless you‚Äôre at cap max.
---
It seemed to me the playerbase was pretty unified in rejecting "2 shot" as a problem but acknowledging that "explosive" was overdue for a nerf.  
---
Did any of that feedback impact the planned changes?
---
Im only lvl 20 but id be down to help out 
---
Sounds like you got out played and out smarted. So you're here, wanting sympathy, which you'll only get it from others who have been conned themselves, and not from those who laugh at your greed that brought you to hunt the bounty from a better player.  
---
Yep, seems like if I am attacked I'm not allowed to attack back
---
IRONYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
yes!
---
I appreciate your comments. 
---
I started this game the same way, my main is lvl70 and my alt is 35. Both have seen griefers, but the main seems to attract a higher camp trashers.
---
Maybe my alt is much more wary and paranoid.
---
Yep, the theory goes that this is how they they explain away the '76 trainwreck' in the runup to the eventual Fallout 5 release.
---
My brother and I are doing a pirate run right now that's been a blast. Black powder pistols/rifles, confederate swords, and molotovs only (or whatever we could get our hands on until we got each of them).  Focusing perks on booze, lockpicking, and boosting the black powder stuff.  Atom store pirate hat.  CAMPs either use found boats like the sailboat near Charleston, or build something loosely approximating a corsair to drop in a river. 
---
There's something magical about having 10 black powder pistols favorited so you can take out a horde of ferals in a couple seconds (then spend a minute reloading everything afterwards üòõ).
---
If you get the chance, I'd highly recommend it.
---
I've done the most of the mistress of mysteries quests. Just need to do the last bit and get in her room. 
---
Great atmosphere in that area. It's added to my idea I think. The whole game really has great atmosphere I think.
---
I have completed the BoS Questline and only have one mod available for the BoS Underarmor.
---
Already you have to damage the SQB a certain amount in order to receive the loot.  I think that is fine so you can't just tag the boss and get the full reward, you actually have to contribute.  However, no idea what that amount is.  Sometimes I don't get any loot from enemies and have no idea why despite me damaging them a bit.
---
I jump to assist in defending workshops.  
---
Many times the owner isn't there and doesn't care maybe.
---
Switch to Melee, Pacifist on.  Take out the attackers, all good.  Someone decided to take over the holes up north(Level 8, I believe) and then got the defend your workshop quest, Level 29-59 Radscorpions everywhere. 
---
I was only 34 at the time, and died 3 or 4 times, but would do it again anytime.
---
It is win/win I say.  I get some cash, and some small loot(Get a lot of plans for helping defend, but not that many for defending your own), that person gets to keep their workshop producing and hopefully has everything they need when they return.  I will normally repair all of the turrets and extractors before I leave.
---
Last time I did that event it was at one of the Camps that had two of these guns.  Thought it would be easy XP but nope the second one wouldn't fire at all.
---
I was walking from Harper's Ferry to Whitespring (700lbs) at the time, so why not?  
---
She was killable before so i can't see why not.
---
*cue a wave of people doing the rad sickness emote*
---
Look at you, you're "triggered" right now. You're doing exactly what you disagree with lmao
---
I don't get it.
---
Cool, thanks for passing  it on to the team!
---
Either that or "a time wizard did it"
---
Hehe what is that text supposed to be? Is it an email game of some sorts? Or has the US legal discource gone completely bonkers over night? üòÇ
---
As I said, it takes a certain kind of full blown idiot to come into a video game forum and sling around the word "triggered". Dig that hole a little deeper. ;)
---
I've personally never contacted them, but from other threads I've read they legitimately have no way to restore your items or character. 
---

2 rolls is generous. Must have been eating spoiled meat.
---
A few already have FFS! They‚Äôve trashed my house and burned my crops. 
---
You sound like griefer sympathizer.
---
I killed two guys the other day. One had 3000 steel on him. I took it. It's loot.
---
Whose angry? And how exactly does one obtain emotion from text?
---
Lol.
---
\~ Meh \~  Super-Giraffe neck dog still has that beat.
---
Dungeons, level 150+ mobs 4-5 star legendary spawns that have special skills / weapons they use, Group dungeons requiring specific team comps to successfully complete like a charisma character for heals a tank a dps etc for challenging group content, a fix to the memory leak crashing / freezeing a fix to grouping up where I can join / accept group invites, better survival aspects like night time actually getting dark and temputure to manage, death to actually mean something dying in this game has zero consquence, mob types that require a bit more thought on how to kill them with specific tactics to beat them instead of just one shotting everything but the SBQ, etc etc etc. 
---
Well the achievements is supposed to pop up when you PICK UP your 20th magazine. I got the ingame challenge completion for it but not the trophy. So I‚Äôm now back in the process of filling my inventory with 20 more magazines.
---
Hmmm seems suspicious........ 
---
Vampires explosive shotgun is my goal but it's gotta be rare. I've never even seen an explosive shotgun drop, so I've gone with a rifle build.
---
The answer is to use in game towns. That way there are already buildings, decorations,  etc in your "town" you can claim a house and decorate build and set up defenses. Just make it a huge area similar to how workshops are now. Anyone on the team can build, defend, and repair. By doing this even if someone leaves there would still be structures in place. I would love to have all kinds of areas be faction related. Raiders, responders, BOS, enclave, vault, free states, army, etc.  
---
The great thing is the locations are already in game. 
---
I know, feels bad tho man lol. Im such a noice goi too!!  I give away legendaries to low levels always there with a stimpak when i see a noob down. I have given away more water, stimpacks, bobbleheads, magazines, needed junk items and components than i have ever used in this game. And at nearly lvl 300 i now have the totally undeserved rep as a friggin jnr whopper üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol it happens. also being attacked over a typo....... 
---
The ability to enter nuke silos is questlocked(end of the main line).
---
They probably stopped tracking it haha i know i did.
---
Yep!
---
Yeah no crap?! They killed my friend, so I killed them. They had that much stuff I was overencumbered for about 5 hours tryna sort it out. I saved the video of what loot they had
---
No. You couldn't get into the bunker, much MUCH less survive it.
---
ok cool thanks. 
---
I'm with you. I've seen the series testing other nuke zones and I'm glad that there are at least 2 other spots worth dropping in certain conditions. Unfortunately, they come up slightly short in their effort to compete.
---
Feels like a full house against a straight and royal flush. JMO
---
Just pay attention and back out of the hopper menu if anything but canisters show up...i know it's stupid but paying attention will prevent this
---
He is a total God of a man tho right? (Please Todd dont rape my ps4 with bethesda malware)
---
Sometimes I feel bad about scanning the map for owned workshops, seeing a lower level player owns one of the power stations, going there, and claiming it just to kill them over and over.  A lot of the time they DC pretty quickly.  It must suck to go through the effort of powering up the station and claiming the workshop just to have someone show up right after and kill you repeatedly.
---
Watoga train station has them too.
---
I have a fear of anyone in PvP not wearing PA I got messed up hard by some dudes in assassin/sentinel armor nothing I did damaged them and they just looked in my direction and shot me with a TSE shotgun at far distance was killed by what looked like a single pellet. So no PA no PvP for me.
---
I didn't say they had to be top tier, just that they should have _some_ usefulness.  As it stands now you can max out damage perks on heavy guns and most of the guns are still worthless.  Most of them do so little damage that they are nothing but a waste of ammo.  The plasma gatling gun does about as much damage as a pipe rifle yet it's much more expensive to feed and repair, not to mention it's pretty rare to find one.  Does that make sense?
---
I was in Vault Tech U today and for the death from above warning. Didn‚Äôt think it would be near me so didn‚Äôt check the map.
---
That was a mistake 
---
I think I saw this post awhile back, was blown away. Such a dope build üëå and the view must be amazing! 
---
I have over 10k ammo for .45 and 5.56 ;-; I feel imma be screwed. Crafted a lot of it and bought from other players 
---
And I do indeed get that, but there is no online game in existence that doesn't have some way to look into characters that get screwed up.  
---
I realize first line support has no ability to do anything for anyone, but as I asked, is there some way to escalate to someone who can help.
---
Myron!  
---
If you play a high CHR low INT female he spikes your drink and has his way with you.  
---
Is it possible to maybe lock it down to those that enter the silo in the first several minutes, and then if they need help or ppl want to join the silo in progress, they have to get a team invite or some kind of accept/deny message of whether someone pushing the elevator button can join in?  
---
Wow! Impressive! I've just started looking for pets last night. That's one worth putting the Pacifist flag on yourself so he's a bit safer from other players.
---
I'm not too worried. The only people I've had come by so far all gave me a wave or a thumbs up. And anyone who gets a wanted level is just going to get one shot.
---
I don't see any unyielding sentinel pieces, do you have any?
---
I bought the game to play pve, and Ill help anyone in game who needs it.
---
But the facts are pvp and the bounty reward system ingame is not the best.
---
I value my time and I enjoy crafting as much as questing.
---
I didn‚Äôt spend all that time building out my camp just so some douchebaggery can use my camp as target practice for their TSE or explosive weapons.
---
Trust me when I say, as a pacifist pve, no one wants survival mode to start sooner then me lolz
---
Thought my feelings were justified haha and yea, thats another one for me as well.
---
It's not slinging it around if it's accurate to most of the populus, yourself included apparently. I've got time to dig, do you?
---
I would be happier if it targeted people that were hiding and not helping
---
Lost a jetpack that way, thanks to uranium fever
---
To make matters worse I had junk containing steel in my inventory but it prioritized scrapping the mods
---
Ranged and melee. I switched to all sorts of weapons to try to get it back but had no luck.
---
Why would it be a new tactic, it's been happening since day 1 .. you did the right thing, why didn't you just server hop. For me I would immediately block them so they don't see where I am, block and report on XB1 and give him a big fat thumbs down and stand your ground.
---
I had these douches show up at my camp, shoot it up, I blocked them, then they started switching weapons, was hilarious, did little slap damage as I sipped on my water .. they eventually moved on .. was quite funny though ..
---
What you could of done I guess is going hang around a group of robots, he would be bound to hit one of them eventually ..
---
After extensive personal testing, the level limit on Handmade plans showing up in Harper's is not 15-44 or 15-24 as often stated, but 15-19.
---
I have found the plans multiple times on characters from 15-19. 
---
I server hopped for 6 hours with a level 20 character with no luck.
---
Sure, I agree as far as FO76 goes. In the real world you need regulation, because for any rational actor, the only thing better than healthy competition is no competition. 
---
Is what you‚Äôre doing against any rules? Just curious.
---
A soothing voice fan, I see!
---
Yeah, I thought it would easier to find them! 
---
Do you want Bethesda to outright die? F76 made it fairly obvious that they clearly can't handle an online game properly. 
---
O' PRAISE INDEED!
---
You suck
---
I thought that was only for melee and armor though? And i thought of that, but i dont really use those kinds of 'aid' items. Plus, it was a consistent number up until like 2-3 days ago. I made this post after noticing the third effected weapon.
---
Accurate to most of the populus [sic]?
---
The _populous_ is not triggered by Fallout 76 and the next time you pick a buzzword you should know what it implies. Because you're stupid and you're challenging people to help you show how stupid you are does not make them "triggered". ;)
---
Oh my God, does this mean I have to talk to people in real life?
---
To be fhhhair! üßê
---
Well you could argue that I got sucked in by a kind of cult that prays to a kitten.
---
Unless she flies off the map. 
---
Ya, those big houses are neat.
---
So, its been 12 days since you replied and said it would be coming out "soon" (I appreciate you responding by the way), is there a time frame when that might get released? In the next week, month, quarter..... year? 
---
And as a reminder, the first time it was mentioned it was 49 days ago, when the list was coming out "in the next few days".
---
Im assuming the dev team has a list of bugs that is serving as their "to-do list"? Just copy that list, remove any exploits that arent well known if you need to.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude and forgive me for being ignorant but who cares? Cosmetics alone is there any real value to clean spacesuits?
---
I honestly never saw her go down before TSE became prevalent. 
---
Too many low level shed hiders made her too tanky. 
---
Nope. No mutations at all, and its two TSs and an Anti Armor. Id say maybe the nerf, but the time frame wouldnt make sense.
---
Well done, you found a wild asshole. There are a few in west virginia and you did pretty much the SOP, good job for not getting goaded into a fight with a salty little asshole who, undoubtedly had a tse shotgun hiding up his ass with about 2k stacked explosive bobbleheads . You made the right move there homie üëç
---
It is kinda sad to have to kill them! =]
---
Monogah? (If that is how it is spelled)
---
I didn't want to hop because I was hanging out with friends, and I tried to get him to hit a robot.  He must have been using vats because he kept missing them.
---
I have the other two sack hoods with hoses and whatnot but where did you find the "sack hood"?
---
No rule I ever saw anywhere says you can not put items on a character and retrieve them later.  Why would it be against the rules.
---
If I am wrong, please tell me why having items on my character is against the rules.
---
Maybe you could find a vampire knife to get "up close". That would help the role play portion.
---
Yes. I have been in lobbies where everyone was stashing garbage legendaries in the ice chest, myself included. It makes no sense that people automatically jump to, "that person is duping."
---
Every one of your comments on this post is salty af.   
---
"Yeah. Sucks it wont fix shit. Oh well. Atleast we wont scrap mods anymore
---
I see ive upset fanboys by telling the truth about your shit game
---
Go suck todd howards ass.
---
Justify how pitiful you are whatever way you want. Dossent change it."  
---
But please, go on to tell me those things weren't said in anger.
---
One obtains emotion from text through context.  That's how writing works.
---
I don't know how many guns you've ever actually used, but them breaking is really not realistic. 
---
Awesome and while do this, tweak the PvP actions under Adventure to be only allowed in taking Workshops from others or give me GOD protection instead of Slap damage. I'm tired of being blown up when I'm not even fighting back!
---
Prime. Look around for ferns at the bases of trees. Best spot is usually from Prime fissure NW towards the other fissure. 
---
Yes?
---
Are you sure? The achievement/trophy says READ 20 magazines, so i figured you actually had to use them, whereas the challenge is COLLECT.
---
You are very much proving my point, but please continue
---
That's brilliant! I love the idea of building a play-style off of outfits and weapon combinations. I had a Strength/Luck build in Fallout 4 that was insanely fun and based off the Grognak outfit and Axe. Great idea on the pirate play!
---
Well the reason is it's far easier to just shove some retarded pvp mode into the game compared to pve content. And it should be obvious by now that Bethesda prefers the easy way out.
---
That's what i did :)
---
If someone kills him i can still server hop and he's back alive (sometimes level 91, sometimes 52 or 21) but it's a bit boring to do hence the sign :)
---
Thankfully most of my visitors are nice with him ;)
---
While we are not joking about the type of stream we are planning, it is nice to hear that you plan sanctioned livestreams.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I challenge the community (that means you /u/ManyATrueNerd) to a ***YouOnlyLiveOnce*** run to the Scorch Queen. 
---
I might even create a mod to help with the HP bookkeeping until we get custom servers.
---
OMG
---
I agree that PvP isn't grieving, considering the recent changes to how PvP works.  But leveling CAMPs is a different story.
---
If turrets didn't take up such a huge budget, then taking out CAMPs would be more fair game.  As it is, you can either build a crappy shack with a NORAD defensive perimeter or you can spend hours building a nice CAMP, have no defense, and hope for the best.  
---
My thought is that the defense (turrets/traps) budget should be separate from the build budget and it should scale with the Home Defense perk.  
---
Take guns and armor out of storage to fit junk fast when necessary.
---
I have a level 10 vampire explosive 10mm, not quite as effective as the shotgun but about half a bag into a group will heal me to full at low levels.
---
I would like to see build costs split into three bars as well. All at the current 100% setup as well. I know the servers can handle it because my camp got duped several times when i moved. Nothing bad happened and it never had issues. I only ended up ripping it down due to wires costing budget so no power....
---
1. Defense.
---
2. Structures.
---
3. Decorations.
---
Never engage, as soon as you see players at your camp, log off and change servers. This is what they want, they want you to fight back so they can keep destroying your camp without consequences and get your caps in the mean while. Just log off, go fix what they broke, move on. Forget about revenge unless you into PVP and enjoy the challenge etc .. for regular folk like us it is rarely worth while engaging, in fact if you engage you ignorant because you likely know what the outcome will be. Smart players don't engage .. my 2c block, report, move on....
---
YOU WON'T DUPE ME WITH THIS POST!
---
I keep my one enclosed so things don‚Äôt kill it.
---
I plant some razorgrain just in case someone kills my ‚Äòcow‚Äô.  It‚Äôs annoying.
---
Oh, for sure. I can't think of a way more satisfying to both parties other than the correct 3ngagement clause, or by using a level curve or something
---
Blocker perk works all the time and that damage reduction will go into effect first. Then 50% of that reduced damage will then be reflected back to the attacker. Btw, the Reflecting legendary effect does not reduce any damage taken, simply reflects 50% of your damage taken back to the attacker
---
I don't think I have enough caps plus I've already got a 3* level 50 blade 
---
I mean, Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out tomorrow, so I‚Äôm set for the downtime. üòÇ
---
Enforcer is great for all things just about. I love using it on Vertibirds &amp; the cargobot. The vertibirds become like the old "garbage truck on ice" video where they have no way to target you but just aimlessly bounce around. 
---
Sons of Dane compound n savage divide has a death tambo in the barn. I want say it's a minimum  level 15 item.but not 100% sure. Plan is from raider vendors I think. 
---
Nope. And my comment won't kill them, nor will them producing more mmo games
---
I hope one that knows how to fix the powered gates for Brick, and to add the handmade plan where it deserves to be. 
---
I DESERVE ALL THE PLANS GOD DAMMIT
---
The point that you're making that you're the least sharpest tool in the shed and want people to know it?
---
I mean, I said that already, but I'll gladly make fun of you some more. You realize you joined this thread from a reaction you had and wanted to defend someone else, right? Then proceeded to try to use a word you couldn't spell to explain that everyone else was having involuntary reactions. And now you're still replying with the lamest of possibly responses.
---
Yes, the point is very much being proven. Go outside, 15 year old. ;)
---
D'oh! I misread that, I'm sorry! I thought you were making a joke about us showing off the inside of our engine. 
---
It'll probably be the NV scopes, those are the ones obtained through purchased plans
---
Good points .. 
---
I assumed there was some rule against it. Cause I also do the same thing. And many items are missing. 
---
Got one ;)
---
I wasn't even sure it could appear as sold by vendors, I shall "Remain Vigilant" arf!
---
I have 1 copy of the plan left, I'll sell it to you for 1000 caps. Gt Walery
---
Yeah I'd almost rather pay  10 caps to every person on the server than continue playing waiting for the headsman  axe .
---
Here comes the TSE nerf
---
This actually works? That‚Äôs super useful if so!
---
huh..perhaps a perk you accidentally took off, maybe bloody mess?
---
also, adrenal reaction increases weapon damage the lower your health is. 
---
I'm pretty impressed! Great spot for photos!
---
Are you on PC? I can donate the mats you need.
---
The exact same thing happened to me, lost over 600 bullets. really ticked me off
---
yeah, sorry, i was referring specifically to the Radium Rifle ones :)
---
Just got these yesterday from the Free States mission.  Both at once, when you restart the server...Sorry hope this doesn't spoil too much.
---
Psh.
---
I'm gonna catch up on podcasts 
---
I have a 3* blade and 3* 10mm submachine gun but they are level 50 and I'm 45 so have yet to use them. Where did you find the 10mm?
---
I got the razor grain on the side. Budget is tight, no room for fences and, this is people killing them, not in game NPCs. 
---
No need, you can still have a cool camp. These incidents aren't are much as people like to say including me. I like the fact you have to try remain hidden to avoid the wild life .. worse case is you walk up to your camp and say repair all .. doesn't always work but will likely get better.
---
Took me an hour to repair mine, I saw it more of a quest to rebuild :) I actually sort of enjoyed it.
---
I had this and figured it out.  I had built level 2 turrets on the roof of my house.  When I was moving my camp, I didn't have the Home Defense perk card equipped, so I wasn't capable of "building" level 2 turrets.  Once I equipped that perk, I was able to place my blueprinted house with the level 2 turrets on the roof.
---
So are there rules about how much stuff you can have, where you can store it, how many items you can have in your inventory?  There is nothing about it in terms of service.
---
If they are going to spontaneously delete items you gathered, what is the point of gathering items and playing the game?
---
We all have them just log onto your pc and load up the Bethesda App.
---
As a proud West Virginian I can say that a large number of the destinations in the game are very close to real life and completely worth a visit. 
---
You mean other people don't have 600lbs of junk?  Just me?  lol.  
---
I walked from Whitespring to Charleston (Graham and the Charleston vendor spawn there sometimes), to R&amp;G, to Whitespring (24 hours were now up), to Watoga to Harpers Ferry.  That was with two shocks in my excavator armor.  At that point I was down to 450lbs + 600 in the stash, so I could fast travel.  Flux is HEAVY.
---
I wouldn't worry about ammo. Unless you have like 100k. Players needing 5mm will have tons of it. I have several thousand of .38, .45, 5mm and other rounds. 
---
Having 10k of say, nuka colas or bobbleheads, would be an issue. Something with an inherent rarity.
---
The keypad power doors could serve a similar function, but have you noticed that the brick wall ones have the keypad on the inside of the door.
---
Quantum entanglement as the C.A.M.P device stores all your stuff, some of it gets accidentally duplicated, but it tries correct itself. What you're experiencing is what happens when it fails to correct the issue internally. 
---
Even if created by someone with the plan, they‚Äôre min lvl 15. So, depends on how low lvl you‚Äôre talking about, I guess. 
---
You could be right there.
---
I've had my camp set up by the train station at whitesprings since a week after launch though and never had an issue with it being attacked. even if i did id just move it slightly so most of it repairs for free.
---
Not sure why people loose there shit over there base getting attacked, again its a PVPVE game if you don't want your base attacked pick it up when your not using it.
---
I'd be very upset at being interrupted in a flux cap run.
---
Nope just wanted to see if anything caught ur eye!
---
Just generating discussion and a counter point is all.
---
No worries. I love you guys, and you do a much better job with the official patch notes now, but it is still nice to dig deeper and tweak with a few things.
---
As a horror movie fan, I love that you're roleplaying as Jason. Overall though, this is a great post on PVP etiquette. Some players don't want to PvP and its nice that you respected that and passed this story along. 
---
Hrm. Ok that does sound good =) 
---
you get caps for kills
---
LOL, this game is one big social experiment. I think the PvP servers are going to be bonkers with all the crazies already in the game. Can't wait for March to give that a go.
---
If you went outside one of the front doors and hung close to them, I am pretty sure even with vats .. block him from sessions and see if you can out game him .. he will have to spot you in a crowd ..  there will always be little dickbags .. I get pleasure from blocking and reporting them. I would rather them destroy my camp as long as I can get there GT and report them, to me that is my justice .. part of the game, try not to sweat it .. hopefully the new PVP servers will allow them to move on .. but I doubt it because these players are all pussies.
---
Yeah, I suddenly discovered I had 400 lbs of flux in my stash.  I had no idea.  It took me two days of walking around to get rid of some of it.
---
This
---
People with bounties can‚Äôt see others on the map.
---
Were you using explosive weapons? They're still messed up, some of the time, against Scorchbeasts, SBQ, and humans. 
---
I‚Äôve done that too, moved it a few feet just to store it.  But some people have theirs integrated into a specific spot.  Makes it harder put it back down. 
---
Yeah reporting him wasn't really much of an option because he wasn't breaking any rules, he was just being an a-hole.
---
Because this is still not answered anywhere. And then people bitch and moan about not using a search function. But then other people bitch and moan and necro threads.
---
I picked up a gatling laser in the last week or so, but I don't recall if it was ultracite or not.
---
Mods come from breaking the exact weapon
---
Gunsmith has no bearing on learning mods, only applying them
---
[Yeahhhh.....](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/157/itsatrap.jpg)
---
Oh... So that‚Äôs why the 50 molerats I tamed didn‚Äôt come to my camp...
---
yeah, we both were.
---
Um ok you do you boo boo but pass that ballistic fiber pls
---
Is the constant ce-848780- screwed BSOD, on PS4 pro, ever going to get fixed?   3x's in the last hour!
---
Do you have specific plans you can't build that you think you already learned the plan for?
---
There were a couple of plans that had incorrect names a while back.  
---
Example:  Advanced Power Connectors were called Barn Building Set, so you could find a "Barn Building Set" and think you were getting that only to actually get the Advanced Power Connectors, and still be unable to build the Barn walls.
---
I understand.  I‚Äôm not running a farm, only a single poo maker.  Had a rl friend kill my first one because he didn‚Äôt believe me when I said it was mine.
---
Got him back later.  I beat him down with a baseball bat then cannibalized him.
---
And one of the coolest outfits in the game
---
It‚Äôs happened to me since I got it for Christmas 
---
The new version is worse as well since it takes the whole server down not just them.
---
No problem! Good luck, it took me a good 10 minutes of moving stuff around but I hope it helps! 
---
Red Lazers.
---
Why do you keep assuming people are 12 or 13? Or that I'm 15? Do you have a thing for kids? Pedophilia is a serious crime. And the winking is just making it worse
---
yes but again its a pvpve game, cant have everything.
---
If Bethesda had meant for it to be PVE orientated they would have put "safeguards" in for the pvp'ers
---
shooting the floor? Yeah, I noticed it after getting the first explosive mod fitted on my chestpiece and trying to test it out.
---
Launching
---
Deathclaws are no match for Enforcer either!
---
Ya, it will be interesting to see what happens 
---
gunsmith perk doesn't affect the ability of unlocking mods with scraping. 
---
Pretty sure you have to buy that
---
Have you swapped out any perks?
---
I have one
---
I believe I found mine at the raider vendor at the northernmost railroad terminus in the Divide. It's probably available at all of the raider vendors, though. My gf hates it...
---
Took you a while to type that mediocre response out. I just assumed you had a reason to try to defend a kid and had a thing for that kid for some reason.
---
I guess it's not because you're 15 and have some projection problems. ;)
---
I'm having fun playing around with a few fun builds I plan to share. Being a firebug medic is a ton of fun
---
Yea I would never stoop to tha...... 
---
IS THAT ALUMINUM!!!!!!....
---
Must.... resist......
---
Doesn't matter to me, they allowed to grief me, I am allowed to block and report him, fair game for me. Anyone who interferes with me in the slightest with intention to provoke gets an immediate block and report, no questions asked. I am not going to block a level 6 taking pot shots at me because he doesn't know better, but these guys with TSE's I. have zero tolerance for .. I couldn't care less if they just playing the game, they engage me they risk getting block and report, it's that simple. There are 1000 things to do in the game, loads of quests, tons of enemies to kill, so go frigging kill something that deserves to be killed. smh at these idiots ..
---
This. I just play all the songs from all fallout games on my phone.
---
You get Brahmin by unlocking the Brahmin Pen plan, so once that's done you can just place as many as you want and they'll roam around and moo and stuff. Eventually they're likely to end up in clusters, especially if there aren't a lot of places for them to go (Chally House is a small area with only one or two 'lanes' to walk around through).
---
Ive noticed the duplication. Didn‚Äôt know it did that though! Thank you! 
---
Agree completely. It should be fun when an entire server comes and stomps the queen, not arbitrarily more of a slog. 
---
Same issue. On PC, not wearing power armor. Using a recon scopes on a combat rifle and combat shotgun.
---
Anything good from the turn ins?
---
He definitely had something up his sleeve.  I was 60 levels higher than him.
---
&gt; junk for punks
---
And you already have the perfect business name
---
How would that work for the SQB, going to add in a match making system as well for solo players?
---
I really hope this stuff is being thought out at Bethesda HQ :/
---
&gt;Ladydevann
---
Bonuses for creative play styles... just sayin' that should be a thing.
---
This is wonderful! A random note but I love that all the furniture is red. It's nice that it all matches. 
---
What is technical data used for anyways
---
You appear offline
---
Go ahead and try verifying your game files.
---
The anger sets in. It‚Äôs all downhill from here.
---
Oh will it work the same because although I‚Äôm primarily on pc I bought it on ps4
---
And not just explosive weapons. I have a 10MM Auto Pistol and I still get people healing out of nowhere all the time.
---
Well that is a lot of work so I must admit if they do that amount of work to kill me to get caps, well good on them I can respect that kind of dedication and commitment to a kill.
---
Yep! Easy way to boost the stats 
---
I have been server hopping for 1-2 hours almost everyday last week and have not seen them.  Was lvl 25 when I started and am now 31.
---
This would seem to support your theory.
---
I wonder what the reason is doing the patch on all platforms at once and not PC first like before? I thought they were all concerned about how slow hotfixes would come onto consoles vs the PC.
---
It should buddy as you know the first ones are pc only games as well.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have volunteered that info.
---
Official [Tweet](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1089987085782667264)is up as well! 
---
Yeah I know that I was just wondering if it would still work
---
Either is plausible, which makes it even more:
---
BuT pIpE wEaPoNs ShOuLdInT bE iN sAfEs
---
He definitely was trying to goat, you have to remember a lot of these guys are making videos while playing, you just becoming their content. I see so many low levels shoot back, some of it can be funny because people should know better or be more educated. Just assume they making a video of you .. maybe next time put on a cool outfit or something .. them them some love and thumbs up .. make it funny .. people around the map trying coax them into pvp as you said. Not engaging is the best medicine ..
---
**711 hours**
---
Or just be at work.  Probably done by the time I get home (hopefully?)
---
Cause there will always be people who will enjoy nice things in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Besides this is not about role playing. This is about cowards who hit and run. In the real world they would not be able to run very far. 
---
That's it. I'm starting my own in game radio station.
---
You are giving him exactly the attention he wants, change server and move on. These people will always exist, stop playing their game and just block and move on.
---
Agreed.  I actually thought converting bodies to meat piles, besides lightening loads on servers, was to give players a better clue where corpses were.  Maybe we just need moar flys to make better, or flies with more color in them?
---
Theres this thing called work that people do, usually at jobs they have. Might wanna look into getting one, it could help feed your neckbeard habits
---
Time for the ~~S.A.F.E.~~ D.U.P.E. test
---
If only you were on PC....I've got 11 nukes i have no need for, but can't bear to throw them away...and boy could I use more shotgun shells...
---
Another one. Didn't they teach you how to type in school or is that next year?
---
I'm at my job, little one.
---
We definitely see this topic brought up- wanting a larger budget- and we've included it in our reports to the Dev's.
---
The little red guy (with a pointy tail and pitchfork) on my shoulder likes your style ;-)
---
Lastnight, the other guy (with a harp and weird white robes) convinced me to listen to him.
---
That too. 
---
Was waiting my turn to vendor at a train station once and the guy holding up the robot started doing this quick "blubudadoo" noise after I waved at him. I just ignored it but I started heading down the tracks to the next station and he followed me about half-way, just doing the same thing....rapidly wave-emoting me and making that noise over and over. Was relieved when he turned back. &gt;_&gt;
---
Wasn't threatening, wasn't creepy, was just...weird.
---
Thats what i guess im unsure of. What perks will effect my pistols and/or dps other than gunslingers? Because those are active
---
All I see in the post is \[removed\]. Did some mod spoil all the fun and not even bother to leave an indication of what was there? xD
---
&gt;In the real world
---
&gt;a post-apocalyptic wasteland
---
Thank you! üíï
---
Just to clarify when I said ‚ÄúBecause of griefers,‚Äù I was answering his question, when I put the other part in about the caps that was a different clarification.
---
LOL, I farm shotgun shells there as well. My current melee bonuses enables me to almost one hit anything so when I show up it might seem like I am just taking the piss but I am not. I am actually farming shotgun shells for my shotgun build (favourite build tbh).
---
There's an Instigating Barbed Flaming Pitchfork out there somewhere just begging to be renamed "Liberal Firebrand"...
---
Nope. Is there any other perks that effect dps or pistols? To my knowledge ive only been utilizing the 3 gunslingers at rank 1, and theyre still active.
---
And thanks üëç
---
Look near the chemical paint sewer drains. There is a quest that, once completed, puts waste into the river, causing the blooms. 
---
Once you do this, the pods along the river will always be blooms. 
---
Ah man. I have one on XB1, it's been my favorite weapon for a month, and I was just considering switching to a different build.
---
I wish I could sell it to ya.
---
Craft away! That‚Äôs over 800xp in throwing knives by the time you‚Äôre done. 
---
Lmao the first time I killed it I got knuckles and the second I got a boxing glove.üòÇüòÇ
---
In a real post apocalyptic world there would be armed guards and bounty hunter and this cowardly hit and run by someone with no caps on them would not be possible.
---
haha this is the wasteland bro, catch them lil' fuckers and fry um up with a nice juicy synth steak!
---
Do you mind asking them (whom it may concern) to consider doing something about campers showing up at the queen, firing one or two shots and then hiding the whole time.  They are making the queen harder with their presence and doing nothing to help fight it.   We don't need an extreme solution here, but it would be nice if there was something given to balance that the fact that there are a bunch of campers ramping up the difficulty but not contributing anything useful.    Maybe they should be PvP-able (without them losing caps) to get them out of the area.
---
It's great helping out the lower levels but there are a few turds out there haha. I dropped one fella 6 legendary weapons and a load of plans then noticed he had a recipe I didn't have, he tried charging me 500 caps haha.
---
Still gotta thank the dude that dropped me a load of free plans outside the vault when I was level 1.
---
They did teach me but it's been so many years. You sure do project insecurities onto other people a lot. Tell me, does it help any?
---
Yeah I can't wait to test it!
---
Hell I'd be fine with anyone under 40. 
---
YES  
---
people accuse me of "duping exploits" because they do no damage to my assassin sentinel armor
---
You duped this opinion!
---
And at that point the amount of caps traded between players has to be enormous to be worth anything. 
---
This is wonderful, I love it! Also as someone whose been gaming both on PC and console for over a decade I could never adjust to keyboard controls for any game. Part of it is My clumsy brain can't handle keyboard commands, and the other part is a pretty messed up wrist (Possibly carpal tunnel). Have you tried plugging in a controller for her to use? 
---
How many screws do you have?
---
I was debating on whether to do that or not, but it'd also useful crafting fuel 
---
So it is next year that you learn it.
---
It could help you to make some useful conversation if you had a useful skill like typing. You sure don't have any conversation skills.
---
I agree totally. But intended or not players killing glowing one enemies were getting a lot more xp than Bethesda intended. That's one reason some players are so shocked by the higher levels. The ratio of time spent vs xp earned is much different if you were not killing the glowing one enemies. There are many more.
---
Once you progress thru the story missions far enough to find the Brotherhood of Steel, they are related to a repeatable side quest that gives you some random, possibly good, rewards for turning in the Technical Data.
---
Ahhh well sry looking for specific stuff!
---
I was hanging out in my Hunter's Longcoat and switched to my Nuka-Cola T51B with the jetpack, so I was wearing my cool outfits. &lt;grin&gt;
---
I'm doing this quest now. I have the chemicals. I can deposit bone meal, but it will not allow me to deposit any other chemicals. Anyone else?
---
So much for building combined camps with your teammates. 
---
If you go to the remote ranger station tower near the observatory, the plans randomly spawn in the box up top. It's a neat little side story about a ranger wasting taxpayer dollars planning holiday parties on the clock. 
---
&gt; That's what a duper would say 
---
Hmmmm...
---
Plenty, been hoarding those since launch. Whatchu need? I'll be on once I get home, about an hour
---
Not only that but also witch hunted, just like synths in FO4. It is brilliant imo, it is like a real world experiment in a little sandbox. 
---
the sad thing is that he is only level 91 because he is a scorched version of the tameable level 21 deathclaw  
---
next time you log in, he will be level 21  
---
dont ask me how i know.... =( =(
---
That's actually a good argument. High five on that. However if you choose to be a dick. If you CHOOSE to be a dick, then you're a dick.
---
I like the idea of locking it temporarily, but think there needs to be a timer on that so folks can't just squat in a silo for hours and block other people from getting in.  Maybe give teams 30 minutes (or whatever) to get in and launch, but as a trade off then take away the timer on killing the SBQ because it is annoying and drops you out of the game.  Instead just have her hang around until the nuke zone itself disappears, or even have her respawn occasionally so there is a reason to hang around and try to fight her again.
---
&gt; I can recommend you some single player creative games if you want to build things and not have other players come along and completely legitimately destroy them. 
---
Why is it that shitty griefer supporting scum like yourself keep telling us to go play some other game like you freaking own this game. Why don't you go play some other game.
---
Hopefully, we are able to make factions for specific groups. 
---
For an example, you could join the different raider groups or join the responders, which could have multiple people. In that group.
---
Ok, so this is just another 'I want the game to dish out punishment because the playerbase won't do it' posts.
---
glance through them all for effects, I can glance myself once i get off work.
---
&gt;Minigun outdps any other heavy weapon I believe
---
Only when explsoive with armor penetration or against low-armored enemies.
---
If you try to kill a super mutant behemoth with a regular minigun without stabilized you will not enjoy the experience lol
---
To be fair, there are some people who do that to grief (shoutout to the jackass who spent the entirety of Uranian Fever standing in front of me so I couldn't hit the legendaries then turned his TSE on me when I finally got a shot in). But they're the minority, so.
---
Dupers poisoned out water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague onto out houses!
---
Well yeah you‚Äôre supposed to just read the thread lol. my first comment is the answer to the question though, barring weird named alcohols, any hard alcohol will work. Whiskey, vodka, bourbon, and rum all work. I haven‚Äôt tested it but moonshine should too.
---
Tell me about it, I just came back after about a 3 week hiatus. Only because I got so burnt out on inventory management. I try my best to keep it under control, I think clearly defining your build and setting specific goals for yourself helps with that a lot. My character only uses these such weapons, is focused on crafting these such gear/supplies, so I WON'T pick up anything not relating them. But it's still not always enough. 
---
Luckily I made a friend who yesterday showed me 3 unique vendors I hadn't discovered yet. That was a godsend! But I worry it'll eventually catch back up to me lol. Oh well.
---
You know, im lvl 293 and ive never used it lol. Whats it do?
---
Actually the ones who think they own the game are the ones whining and complaining about getting PvP'd when the game was *explicitly marketed* as such a game. Do some product research before buying next time.
---
I've seen Vengeful Mothman twice, each time from afar near my camp north of the Emmett Mountain Waste Disposal site. Both those times I noped out of the server because I did not want to deal with that near my camp. Had a Wise Mothman scream at me once and then vanish, so that's my one and only encounter with their kind in like 100 hours of game play. Any other time I've stayed the heck away!
---
Ran into the same thing, except they went to my base which isn‚Äôt close to anything, then destroyed 1 thing... my Decon station. Hardest to repair. Went to kill him, and he had friends. Thought what the hell, it‚Äôs just caps, but he and his friends could not be killed. They knew what they were doing. 
---
which one, what platform?
---
I want to dish out the punishment and I simply asked for ideas on getting even. Read the post next time.
---
unyielding melee characters can still kick the shit out of her, they can match or exceed the DPS of TSE weapons
---
Sorry to hijack the thread, but when is Momma Dulce's Hopper /  Feed The People bug going to be fixed?   I lost a piece of high level Chameleon Armor when placing quest items into the hopper and couldn't get it back out.   Many others have reported this issue where random items from elsewhere in their inventory show up in the "filtered list" on the left and because they are clicking through it adding things to the hopper, they lose things to it.
---
I saw a couple people ask about this very thing today and would really like to know when this bug that was present in beta will get fixed since it is costing people legendary gear, power armor pieces, and ammo (just from what I've read today and my own personal experience).
---
It's random, but most of the time he's lvl 91
---
Won't be on until later, but I may take you up on that.   GT is the same as ID.
---
I have pharma perk, I always have extra disease cure and don't stay diseased long. No traps or firecracker plants when this happens. Although one time I was being followed by an invisible ghoul for 30-45 minutes before I server hopped so I could fast travel again lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it gives you all of the letters from one. And I‚Äôm on pc.
---
I admire the amount of thought you put into this, but certain perk lines would not be accessible whatsoever. This is too advanced to be a part of FO76, and more suitable for an offline game such as FO4. I'm suggesting this is a better mod, not default content. It changes so much that most players would not want to use it after what they have already accomplished and worked hard for, and the benefits in my opinion are far outnumbered by the negatives. Most players that would stumble upon this quest line would undoubtedly complete it and wish they never did because of the stark negatives.
---
 An improvement to this idea would include completing a quest line like you stated, except your character is unaffected. Instead it unlocks a Super Mutant Character with some of the benefits you suggested, and less restrictions on the negatives, so players can notice they are stronger in certain aspects but not be limited from certain perks or abilities. At least make it so if they want to counteract these negatives, it can be done with hard work by leveling up or some similar fashion. 
---
You had a decent idea though!
---
You called the griefers instead of players.
---
Sadly I havent been so lucky. I'm on PS4 if you ever do stumble upon them again and want to make a deal. CAMP building is by far my favorite aspect of this game. 
---
Oh where does the quest start I‚Äôve completed the bos quest line 
---
Or we can just have area loot. Loot one and you get window pop with all the loot from all the bodies around it
---
I was extremely excited at the possibility of selling my very own marinated, chipped soylent to all you grill-tastic Omega-men out there. Alas... Cannibal perk, you let me down.
---
I usually craft knives with super duper equipped, scrap them, then craft what I need mods learned in. 
---
I hope that the pvp servers wont be full of this.
---
I am fine with PvP. Lets make it easier to hunt down hit and run cowards. You need to take a reading comprehension class and read this post again
---
chameleon and stealth work for this too  
---
the key to beating sentinels is to stagger and follow up while they are staggered. enforcer is amazing for this 
---
Yep! You can also get it from the Mothman museum.
---
do you mean the small letters set or signs and letters (neon letters)? i have a spare small letters set, also on pc
---
Anti-Armor/Bloodied/Furious (for high RoF) should *all* be better (in practical use, not on paper) than Two-Shot for most ranged weapons after nerf.
---
Two-Shot has a fairly large accuracy drop. If you're shooting something like an explosive shotgun, that's not a problem, but anything over 100+ range/without an AoE component is going to miss 2nd shots, a lot.
---
I like yours. Mine is just all butts and stuff
---
You have flagged them for research.  I do that with lead because im always needing it.
---
In this particular situation, I agree.  The moment she responded to the initial attack, she was signalling that PvP was on and there was no reason to think otherwise.  However, if you attack someone and they simply ignore you, this is sending a clear message that they are not interested in PvP.  Its extremely annoying when people follow you along trying to goad you into PvP when the message has already been sent that you're not interested.
---
I've included this in my report, along with players wanting to be able to rename Power Armor Chasis. 
---
&gt;I am fine with PvP.
---
&gt;Why should I not be able to enjoy the nice things I have earned
---
Make your mind up. Do you want to enjoy your buildings or are you fine with PvP?
---
You really keep pushing this kid thing, I can recommend a great therapist for you if you need it.
---
guy in a clown suit and mask with a ripper came out of nowhere revving it at me inside a dark building.  then after i told him he scared me shitless he gave me the heart symbol.  good times
---
I came here to make this comment, I‚Äôm glad you already made it, dogmeat did the same for dead bodies
---
You can fast travel to the event just click the yellow hexagon and fast travel
---
Even when they don't have bounty?
---
My job was to help you learn to spell _populous_ so that the next time you use it you will look less silly.
---
It's good to hear you have an outlet in therapy. Perhaps use it more than reddit.
---
They should add a mission to the game called "Beatdown on B Dup"
---
Haha yes I recently unlocked the last of the vendors (Enclave) so now I have access to all 7 factions. I think *in general* I'll be ok, but all it takes is a nuke to drop and I can just go pick flowers and wipe out all the vendor caps, lol
---
I got it off a level 14 ** legendary scorched in big bend tunnel west I believe
---
PHAT butts? üòã
---
god no
---
if you think about this even for a second, you would realize people can shutdown nukes by having 3 friends idle in each silo
---
Why not?
---
Fun story: i like to play while high. So i don't get rekt while smoking I used to fast travel back to my camp. Until "duper fever" happened. Had my base levelled four times by overzealous duper hunters.
---
We're at the point where the complaints and impact of dupecusation is hurting the game more than the fucking dupers
---
Blue lazers
---
I want a large glowing bag for my dropped junk that only I can see. Everyone else sees the normal brown paper one. 
---
Yes, you can, just not for free,  which is the whole point of sending the "quickie" friend request! ;)
---
What was the real reason you got banned? 
---
If you have the neon letters then I‚Äôll take those if your willing to give them away.
---
I doubt it will happen this patch, but possibly next one. Lasers suck badly, and even a max level one with adrenal reaction and low health it did 40 damage. My gatling laser is 14 damage so yay.
---
Yeah, This happens to me at least once every queen fight.  Seems to occur when there is a lot going on on the screen.
---
You spent $155 on microtransactions? I'm glad you got banned lol.
---
The Phattest
---
With Martial Artist perk and Speedy Receiver the listed fire rate is 600.
---
It's obviously not that fast, but it does actually feel like a machine gun, unlike the base gun.
---
I dont focus too much on my online image for strangers so I think I'll pass. Thanks for the offer tho
---
I am hoping to see some stability issues addressed in tomorrow's maintenance / update.
---
Hell yeah, high five buddy! And yes exactly. If you didn't need the screws and were adding them to a pile of 1000s, then you're a dick. Bad example because I DOUBT anyone has that many without exploits, but you get the idea.
---
Griefers are the ones who harass and run and just want to try to ruin the game for others as much as possible. They aren't doing any role play or doing anything legitimate in this game. 
---
Yes! I think that every time I'm looking for a dead critter in tall grass. That would be a great help.
---
That's a workaround, though. 
---
If they're going to modify the object, It should be able to be powered from either the interior or exterior and have the ability to have interior and exterior switches. It's just a pain as currently designed.
---
skimping on the details huh?
---
Well if you shot them all at once at your feet in Watoga you'd probably ragdoll all the way to Grafton
---
This is what a ton of my friends say whenever I am able to do something or have something that is hard to achieve they just assume that I'm hacking, duping, glitching.
---
Omg I want that so bad lol my alt could do vendor runs forever
---
no sorry, i only have the other ones. the neon letters are like 9-10k caps on the vendor so they wont be cheap if you even find them online
---
That one was a little faster. It's good to see you're practicing!
---
Strangely, you say you don't focus too much on what strangers think but took the time to make a comment pit in response to trying to defend someone else. That's an awfully contradictory. You should talk to your therapist about it. ;)
---
*You will remember nothing*
---
How about if you don't like someone's post, don't comment. It has nearly as many mobs, so if less people show up then it is better. Regardless of people's opinions, legendary spawn is about the same %.
---
If you can point to all your high quality posts you may have the right to criticize, otherwise there's plenty of discussion going on which is what this subreddit is about after all.
---
I believe it's automatic once you have registered as a soldier at Fort Defiance and then acquire a Technical Data.
---
It also makes it so you can only carry one at a time instead of being able to gather any number of them prior to having the quests.
---
It's call "Forbidden Knowledge"
---
Yeah bro, fuck those du....*cough cough how much fkn aluminium!?!?!?!
---
Just a little taste perhaps üòÇüòÇüòâüòâ
---
Yeah, for some reason i never got round to exploring that bit of the map
---
What would you want for the executioners, tricked out as automatic? Assuming its level 50. Otherwise I have a level 35 furious that I might want modded.
---
How about if you don't like someone's comment, don't reply. Again, same logic, dumbass.
---
"Duuur DUPING ISN'T A THING GUISE, STOP LOOKING IN TO IT OK? YOU ARE JUST BEING PARANOID" Said every AstroTurfing duping shill on the reddit
---
Ok that‚Äôs fine. 
---
I don't have a specific date but I know the Dev's are working on a solution to this. I wish I had a more solid answer for you on this.
---
Hope you kept your receipts.
---
Holy shit, yes.
---
But isn't the atomic soon moonlit cosmetic?
---
MOSTLY TOTALLY AGREE!
---
The problem is, you need a referee.  In order for a referee to do their job, we have to give them the power to make judgement calls.  As soon as referees have the power to make judgement calls, the temptation is huge to fudge calls for the benefit of yourself, another party... or just because you can.
---
And in many cases, a malicious call and an error in judgement are nearly impossible to distinguish.
---
So, we totally need some sort of regulation (even EvE, the libertarian paradise, has rules that function as regulation), but the line between not enough and too much is fuzzy, and a problem no society of humans has ever (or likely will ever) resolve on the large scale 
---
I seriously hope so as new content/game modes won‚Äôt mean jack without the core issues being fixed 
---
According to...who? Sounds like a pretty good raider RP to me.
---
....I feel like without Stash/Weight restrictions I could probably collect 1,000 screws a day if I put my mind to it. I am a packrat to the bone. &gt;_&gt;
---
The card expired, or the codes reset?
---
If it was codes, you‚Äôll have awhile before the new ones are solved
---
Why does that have to be a choice? Why can I not have both like it was promised by Todd
---
Didn't send them any messages no?
---
&gt; EDIT: I just asked Dev about this and it's addressed next patch! (Which is currently planned for tomorrow.)
---
Awesome! It's been happening to me a lot on ps4. 
---
evidence that the weasel scammers in this community are getting scared, trying to drop the evidence
---
No, my card went pop, didn't expire
---
*coughdupingordevroomcoughcough*
---
Proof or GTFO   
---
Show us the email!
---
Todd promised that if people wanted to they could slap your shit around even if you didn't want them to so I would suggest dealing with it.
---
‚ÄúNot jumping really high.‚Äù
---
Sounds like under lvl 31 talk to me.
---
Thanks for the input
---
Where are all the fusion cores? What is goin on,everywhere I look for that last two days I've found nothing.
---
Lucky you I‚Äôve been in contact with at least 5 and all have been level 45 or above and all aggressive I got this game for Christmas
---
I intentionally though of the specific negatives and the idea that some things Would be taken away when it comes to perks and mutations. All of that was intentional in the sense of adding difficulty to the game. I have a few characters myself, and quite often visit this subreddit and watch streams on twitch. I Tailored the negatives to counter the normal complaints of the game being ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù end game. Also it would change the functional aspect of the game for the people who are bored of the usual legendary runs or queen/whitesprings nukes. 
---
I think people would find it just as easy to keep their higher level characters as they are, but start a new character just so they can get to the end of the main story and create a super mutant character specifically from scratch. People do this anyways for fun just with the issue that end game content will still be the same no mater what new builds they do. This would provide a totally different and increasingly difficult experience for that character. So they wouldn‚Äôt be loosing everything they have, it would be just like creating a new character. 
---
In order to spend $155 he'd have to have bought every single item
---
Good to see duping is fixed now ....
---
In order to spend $155 he'd have to have bought damn near every single item
---
Really doubtful someone spent $155 on the atom shop. Unless they have points just laying around there's no combination of things that adds up to that amount that people would want
---
Sorry, I meant 2 might be too strict. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/fnwRbSR
---
Okay.   I can be on in 30 min...my in game name is Pho_Qing.
---
It would also be nice to see which armor pieces are on the chassis when viewing them
---
Nobody interested?
---
Sorry for the delay, I found it exactly where the guy at the beginning of the thread described. It's the road by the dam. Deathclaws definitely spawn there occasionally.
---
Seems like a normal monday to me and my vendors I have. I admit I am shady as fuck and have taken piles like that.   
---
To the victor goes the spoils. 
---
A faction on paper is as valuable are pre-war currency.  There are factions, or there are not.  There ARE vendors.
---
I got mine from a corpse near the Miner Memorial between Whitesprings and Uncanny Caverns. Can't remember much about it but there was a leaflet for the Pumpkin House as well. Vendors buy the outfit for 20 caps when it only costs a couple of cloth and plastic units to make.
---
It was so much worse after the last patch.  With weird double loading screens (would finish loading, then go black or sometimes show your character, then freeze, then go back to loading).  Prior to the last patch that didn't seem to be the case.
---
Also the servers seem to crash after 4-6 nukes.  So active servers just die.  That didn't seem to be as bad prior to the last patch.
---
And for some reason, about 1 out of 10 logins, my character will free.  I can open the map and browse that, even fast travel, but my character will just stand in one place.  I have to leave the server and rejoin a new one for it to work.  This one seems to be related to the double loading screen.  If I try moving the moment the first loading screen is done, it will, but then it will snap back to the start position and then freeze my character.
---
Given that there likely won't be a Wanted system (as it makes no sense) CAMPs are going to get destroyed. It's why I'm not spending much time or resources on mine. 
---
Right, not to mention how many points you'd get from challenges aside. No real reason to to spend money with how many points they give out
---
Well how do you fix it then? 
---
I phrased my question poorly.  I don't care as much about "when" as I do knowing that it is going to be fixed.  It would be helpful if it was fixed in the next couple updates instead of a year later, but the "when" part of my question was not as important.  So your answer is most excellent even if not specific.
---
Thank you for acknowledging it.   Also, please ask the developers to prioritize bugs that hurt players over ones that help players.   The free food from the Mama Dolce's / Feed The People was kind of funny and it made sense that everyone would get something out of it when it was done.   That got nerfed quickly in comparison to the bug where people are losing legendary gear.  I suggest that in the future, bugs that hurt players be fixed before bugs that help players (not talking about huge balance issues here...obviously there can be higher priority things, but a little free food for everyone on a server was fun / funny and it got removed before a much more important bug got fixed.)
---
Honestly, my favorite parts of the map are in that region, but they did NOTHING with them. There's an event here or there, but the mobs are garbage level and there's very little reason to visit.
---
I don't think the keycard can expire - I've had one in my inventory for 3 weeks once. However, if you enter the code wrong, it can get consumed and you're SOL. 
---
Yeah, I knew I had a couple more levels to grind before I could use one. That should go pretty quick though.
---
Raiders would not be able to simply leave the world. Eventually they can be tracked down and dealt with. Just realized I wasted a bunch of time arguing with a moron.
---
That's exactly what the fuck I said to you dumbass, if you don't like their **post don't reply**.ü§î 93% upvotes mean most people find it relevant, so unless you're going to go make something higher quality post wise, you're just being a cry baby/whiner.
---
Sounds like a great idea. It does open one up to possibly more griefing, due to the fact that like a decontamination shower, it will require rare materials and be the first target for a griefer.
---
It also won‚Äôt add any more security considering metal walls can easily be one shotted(whyyyy bethPlz).
---
Where did you see the Jacket for sale on PS4? 
---
It is and you must have looted each desk that is why you are getting nothing. 
---
I think Bethesda dropped the ball on the "safeguards" you mentioned.  The Wanted system was supposed to be one such safeguard.  Slap damage another.  Pre-release, they made a lot of noise about anti-griefing measures taken in the game, spinning it as players can decide whether or not they can participate in a fight or not.  So the game was technically billed as a PVP *or* PVE.  When people get their camps trashed, I think they're upset because it's not the game experience they thought they were promised.
---
no, that's not it.  I know what they're talking about.  Some random component, sometimes not even what you get from scrapping it.  Like a tin can will show \*Spring\*  I assume it's just a bug.  
---
So... what does the e-mail said? I guess you've posted here to see our reactions and opinions, but we need at least some details. 
---
Exactly. The same logic applies to you. You're really a dumbass üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nice throwaway account you got here...
---
I have roughly 3k atoms from challenges alone, I've also bought a decent amount of things.
---
There was a particular technical Dev reason for this patch to be all at once. 
---
I'm going to work just hour before servers go offline. For once I'm happy for it.
---
Where did you see the Tattered Field Jacket for sale on PS4?
---
Good call. Now the real question is... can I survive the compound at this low a level? :)
---
No, they expire, it warns you as they do, didn't quite make it..   I've down it before lol :-)
---
You've never seen a nuke on Whitesprings? Have you not been playing long? I see one there like every other day and I only play for maybe an hour or two a day. 
---
It's the best spot to drop it for the insane glowing creature spawn (although they nerfed the xp from them, they still give over 100xp each)
---
But if you don‚Äôt want that set I‚Äôll take it from you.
---
Just because you can't claim a bounty doesn't mean it disappears.
---
Hey ho, off to the mysterious button...
---
I don't accept blind team- or friend-requests from people (I've spent too many hours on my CAMP to risk it being completely destroyed), but if I've bumped into you in game I am always happy to oblige. I've been really lucky in that I've met some really nice people!!
---
Been trying to pass it on, any time I store up a bunch of recipes or plans myself and my friend already know, I make sure to find the lowest level person and drop em. :)
---
I have had zero reply from bethesda support about my account and when I called them they said they are not at liberty to disclose any information about my account to me and do not offer support
---
Log into your bethesda account on your pc, install the bethesda launcher and go to games - all games. Scroll down to Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics and select install. 
---
All players who played 76 in 2018 get them free including xbox1 and ps4 players. 
---
Hey hey. If we could meet up later tonight (or whenever), what would you want for me to get a BOS Officer Suit?
---
If you're trying to harden your camp against attack, more turrets ain't gonna do much.
---
That's just if they're working alone though.
---
The last large bounty I saw was actually 3 griefers together. The one with the bounty would start attacking a camp (with an exploding shotgun of course) to lure its owner into PvP while the other two were sneaking. The others got bounties a few times but they quickly cleared them. I watched them repeat this cycle 4 or 5 times, destroying camp after camp.
---
Read the post. I claimed the whole 2 cap bounty. 
---
Thats what id like to know, my base its hidden, and even if not, how can they locate it? how can they know that it is my base.
---
In my case was the whole base that they destroyed, including decon shower and fusi√≥n generator, but it helped me to have more stash space because I had too much of everything lol.
---
r/Market76
---
Ok. Thanks for the reply. Really appreciate the work you're doing here :)
---
Oh, that's just Ruprecht the Whitespring Clown.  He also has to eat his apple sauce with a corked fork so he doesn't poke his eye out.  Get a prisoner's collar on him and he settles right down.
---
It will be a while before I‚Äôm on. 
---
Bethesda, Please make Sentinel gear work while standing, and not while standing + while jumping. 
---
I have a video of it but reddit won't let me post it
---
Ok thanks man
---
I posted this question last week, but no one answered. 
---
I found a claimed workshop, which I didnt attempt to challenge. A couple hundred yards away was the owner. I looked in the window of his camp and he shot me twice, causing me to die.
---
Does that sound right to you? 
---
And you're even dumber by your own logic moron. If people like you didn't waste everyone's time by stating your stupid opinion (which 93% of everyone here so far thinks this post is relevant), we wouldn't have to scroll so much to see someone's opinion that isn't fucking dumb.
---
Can you please do it earlier like epic does with fortnite? I believe their updates get pushed at 3 a.m est just take in consideration people with slow internet probably won‚Äôt be able to play much tomorrow due to having to download and be oit of the house most of the day 
---
Possibly.
---
Easy fix though if they cared would be PVE servers, but nope there adding in a version of the game as it was before slap damage was added....even worse, there calling it new content lmao
---
Yep that‚Äôs me most nights (ps4 pro)
---
Yea that'd be ideal. Almost like a clan
---
The great poo only has one weakness.

It‚Äôs candy corn.

Always tried by best to say Danse at the end. Sometimes successful sometimes not.

---
Thanks for letting us know that you spoil your girlfriend.
---
The -2 was the reason I put it away in my stash;  having built a Rifles Perk card spread.  I can‚Äôt remember if I was able to repair it or not, but I seem to remember not being able to.
---
I was helping save someone's camp from some scorched, and was even using VATS and ended up missing and hit his structure. Immediate bounty. Wtf man I was just trying to help :(
---
I keep pacifist on all the time now, but still it seems there should be a way to weed out accidental hits vs intentional mayhem.
---
So what exactly are you hoping for with the other player not being able to 'hit and run'? That you kill them again? And again?
---
Yes! 
---
&gt; As it stands now, people in Sentinel gear can jump in place and remain in sentinel stance, taking significantly less damage.
---
Can you elabourate on why this is a problem or why they would jump and not just stand still?
---
People are starting to actually collect them now, ever since the bug was fixed where they would refill at logon. 
---
Lol right 
---
If only you were on xbox! I used to collect mini nukes before I realized I had no plans to use a fat-man with my current build and left them all in a paper bag by Vault 76.
---
I agree with you there.  I think dedicated PVE servers would make a lot of people happy
---
Great. How do I slap the shit around of this greifer who blocked me and left the server?
---
2K Caps.  It costs me 4 violet and 12 ballistic fiber to make it shielded.  Your choice of officer, knight, or fatigues
---
Never duplicated or exploited 
---
This sucks. I didn't know this was a thing. I guess a workaround would be to take a workshop and set up your camps next to it.
---
Wont let me post pictures have evidence imgur 
---
I get it. Back when shit was allowed in a children's game. Living shit.
---
I found one the other day, I panicked when I got in. 
---
Havent had any reply from bethesda for email or my text option through phone
---
Jealous?
---
destroyed camp for destroyed camp
---
Nah, I just think that your negativity belongs in the r/micropenis subreddit, considering it's at the very bottom under a hundred other comments that are positive/productive. Perhaps you just need to get a life.
---
2-3 turrets to kill molerats or scorch that show up once in awhile is nice so I dont need to stop what I‚Äôm doing to find them and kill them. 
---
Have had zero reply
---
The church of pebbles has great owners. Ran into them then before.
---
They did?!
---
RIP Wade Boggs!
---
Singing too! 
---
Alright. That's alright.
---
The only play throughs Bethesda should show us is internal play testing. 
---
Oh man, the guy who needs a life, tells someone else to get one. Again, your own advice applies to you too, dumbass. You're a true Reddit nerd and you're big mad üòÇüòÇ
---
Dupers were behind 9/11
---
&gt; along with players wanting to be able to rename Power Armor Chasis. 
---
THANK
---
YOU
---
Just what I was thinking they think the problems with the game are the players fault it's pretty mind numbing. 
---
Whenever you are banned, an e-mail is sent to you. Even if it is an automated one.
---
Thank gosh! Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to finish building my trade centers or mini apartments soon!
---
Hey everyone!
---
The dev team is exploring size increases to the stash containers - that hasn't changed.
---
What they are doing now is determining a number for the stash limit that they are comfortable with. As mentioned previously, they just don't want to negatively impact server stability, so it's taking time to get right.
---
Rest assured, we will let you all know on the subreddit once that number is determined and when you can expect to see it in game.

I still have had zero reply from bethesda..
---
It's not what is described, and it's just silly / broken. Description states 'Standing still and not moving', not standing still and jumping. 
---
No, but are we just going to wait around until they do?!
---
Responded to my post
---
At this point you're just parroting what I'm saying. If you honestly think I'm contradicting myself, you have some of the worst reading ability and comprehension I've had the pleasure of witnessing. Clearly you can't differentiate meanings in a basic sentence.
---
&gt; No, I do not work with customers. If you heard things that were said in executive committees etc that are left out of board minutes, your sweet little blessed heart would break.
---
Again, another cute comment coming from you. Is all you do is insult people and try to make yourself seem superior? Because it's only making you seem weaker by feeling like you have to clarify such things. It's like a middle school bully trying to make themselves seem tougher by trying to top what others have said.
---
&gt;That's cute, and I'm not sure if I'm surprised you felt the need to include that comment. " - Exactly the kind of comment that someone who has spent their lives unable to stick up for themselves would say. Poor little tarquin instead finds solace and fake friendship in the internet to satisfy the hole within. 
---
I'm not even sure where you're going with this, or how you could derive such meaning from that comment. And again, all you seem to know how to do is insult people, and not even good insults at that. Get creative.
---
&gt; you are getting ridiculously hung up a comment on a thread
---
I think we're both a little bit too deep in this to say that.
---
Again, you want to refer to me as a child, but with every comment you make, you're sounding like a manchild who hates it when he doesn't get his way... I can't say it's the most healthy or attractive personality to have, but you do you.
---
I think you're either getting confused or terrible sources of info.
---
Game dropped the most during Black Friday, a couple of weeks after launch and that got it down to about half price i.e. around $30.
---
Returns initially were reported by people as being easy and hassle free if you contacted Support. After a while though, Support put a hard lockdown on refunds and refused to do so, giving some lame excuse on how they can't do refunds for digital downloads, which was against a lot of countries consumer protection laws.
---
Neither! :) Responded now
---
Responded now :D
---
It seems to me that when the server is being taxed hard, one of the first things to disappear are corpses and bags.  I've had things that I've just killed disappear including scorch beasts.   I've dropped things in bags for people and had them disappear.   It seems like the game is freeing up memory and it is doing so by getting rid of things that normally would stick around for a while.  It's hard to predict. 
---
I still drop stuff for people, but if it is really important, I'll trade.  The trading interface sucks terribly.  It is slow, klunky, the slider bug is a pain in the butt that not only needs to be fixed but there needs to be a quick key for zero like "Home" or the actual 0 key and a quick key for max like "End" or the 9 key.
---
Very cool I like it
---
Him and I are both hung up on it, but nooooo, I'm the one who is apparently.
---
I feel your pain... hoping the new patch might offer light at the end of the tunnel - Beth said a few ‚ÄòInside the Vaults‚Äô ago that they were tweaking what plans appeared at Vendors...

What? Outfits don't weigh that much. I think my whole outfit collection only weights maybe 2-3lb tops.
---
X01 / ultracite /t60 power armor. Melee damage gets a modified damage boost from wearing power armor.
---
I have sent them countless messages and even called bethesda support themselves and have had zero reply over my account
---
I think fast travel should be allowed to your CAMP 
---
I'm not sure who I should call. The police or your local exorcist...?
---
Post with your real account.
---
Gun fu is actually amazing for a melee build. Snapping from target to target and one-shotting them is pretty fun. I think one rank is probably sufficient.
---
I SAY WE TIP SOMETHING OVER D:&lt;
---
2 days later still on about it childish. Goodbye.
---
It‚Äôs not just outfits but that‚Äôs an example of stuff I have stored. I have also a mass of weapons I don‚Äôt plan on using soon or can‚Äôt use due to levels
---
Actually you are the one who got your shit slapped. And Todd says that's ok.
---
Why won't they let you post it? You can just put a link in the description.
---
He‚Äôs not lying. I duped back before it was considered a bad thing and one hit KO‚Äôed the SBQ. I never shot anyone while stacking bobbleheads, but I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve melted immediately if I had done so.
---
How
---
Outside of the jokes yes this is a bug and no it's not intentional, usually doesn't happen in games these days but you've Hit a texture the game never intends people to see, like going into an unaccesable location in game turning around and seeing a strange texture like this all over the undersides of the map. 
---
So, how many times do you have to crash servers to get that amount of crap?
---
3,000 steel can actually be done legitimately with a bit of elbow grease by mining iron ore with an Excavator Armor and harvesting/collecting a fuckton of acid.
---
This one route I like gives me about 300 iron ore per run, so if I do four runs (each taking about 10 minutes) I end up with somewhere around 1,200 iron ore, which I can then process into 3,000 steel. The tricky part is getting the acid to process it all.
---
It was half price on PSN for weeks in the UK.
---
And currently you get it on PC for as little as ¬£12.99.
---
Think there was a post earlier today about the class action or something, I guess that's what OP was referring too?
---
Thank you my good man!!!
---
bye
---
Petty.
---
Can confirm. Man this one hit me in the feels. But atleast he found his dog.
---
Every blast zone i have been in crashes after 5-10mins
---
Yep cause my brother actually got the achievements whereas I didn‚Äôt. He hasn‚Äôt actually read any magazines he‚Äôs only picked them up. But I‚Äôve put more hours in and have found more magazines AND read everyone I pick up. Still no achievement. I need magazine achievement, hack terminals, mod 50 weapons and reach lvl 100. I‚Äôm currently 85 and trying to make reach 100 my last achievement since all the others are bugged for me I don‚Äôt want to hit 100 and not get it. 
---
 Great. The three TSE weapons that I paid 12k total for will now suck. Thanks, Bethesda. With each patch my game performance gets worse. 
---
You're welcome!
---
Looks like I am arguing with a 10 year old who still hasn't taken reading comprehension. It's been fun. Have a good day
---
They're digital receipt and yes I do have them
---
I‚Äôm on pc platform playing about a month 3-4 hrs/day and never seen one there
---
Did you check your rad stat in your pip boy with it on and off to see if there is a difference?, I don‚Äôt thing legendary effects show on the armour stat when inspecting it 
---
Lolol. Hey you gotta do what cha gotta do in these modern times. Haha
---
Looking goood
---
Either just copy and paste the URL as is or use the link button in the text editor to add it is.
---
He'll level up quickly and if you and he don't mind you can create him some basic armor and basic weapons he'll have a lot more fun being better protected and being able to take things out.   Some people like to struggle for everything.  I'm not one of them.   The most fun I've had in this game is in helping out someone else or getting help to do something really fun.
---
You'd have to ask Hank. I'm just the janitor.

for communication between C.A.M.P.s - Short wave radio / CB radio.
---
if it would be realistic, like you have to have a repeater on top of a hill to transpond any data over that hill etc.
---
magnificent. that would it be, magnificent.
---
only problem will be when they give us the vendor option it will probably be limited to 100 weight or something silly just low enough to make it worthless
---
Thanks, yes it is silly.
---
&gt; fire away with the TSEs without downsides
---
There hasn't been a downside to using explosive weapons since the buff to Fireproof.

I would say the 10 year old is the one with a 'If they did it to me I should be *allowed* to do it to them' mentality.

Only language morons understand is the language they speak.

You're a duper harry
---
That's crazy. I'm on ps4, but I'd figure PC would have just as many if not more nuke events.
---
Do you only ever see nukes at SBQ? Or is there some other location you've noticed constantly hit?
---
ü§îüòòü§£ loser, like I said go talk among your kind with the tiny penises and no life, you're not wanted here.
---
I meant to the people you were pvp'ing and got banned for not Bethesda :P
---
Yeah ik I‚Äôve got x-01 with calibrated shocks and reactive armour but I think there‚Äôs op normal non power armour
---
You know....I didn't even mention the TSE issue in this thread. I didn't do so because I know Bethesda is fixing it.
---
Looks like Level 4, should be under intelligence:

This has happened to my friend as well. He was harrassed on Xbox messenger after beating a group of several players. He got banned for using the same weapons they literally had in the clips he took of thier fight. Bethesda doesnt seem to care about actual harassment from a group of players. It is just easier to ban the one guy that is reported at the same time by a bunch of individuals  (sheep). 
---
That's so adult of you to just assume. Haha. Yes that's what i always do when i have no valid opinions either. 
---
Thank you for the bump Lone ya legend.
---
Lmao, so you're a nerd and you like talking about tiny dicks. I think I know about all I need to know about you üòÇ
---
In fallout. You are the car 
---
Very good! Impressive
---
I thought this was originally how the game had the camp designed and when I figured out it didn't I was kinda disappointed! Very good concept why wouldn't it be like that? 
---
Its in my library how do i link it 
---
Honestly the only reason i kill scorchbeasts is to get some peace and quiet. So since it left the task has been acomplished.
---
this is what i did but now im scared to use it cause apparently bethesda is banning account with ab normal amounts of particular items so if i stash all lets say 5mm ammo i dont use and it builds to 10k plus over months now i can get banned thats ridiculous 
---
Its an adhesive junk item you get around watoga and cranberry bog, thats in the purple pod things. If you click them before theu expell green gas you get disgested goo.
---
I always am. I don't wanna catch what they've got.
---
I am on a phone
---
Exactly, it's not given to you when you scrap the object, and it's not related to components I've tagged for search. And identical items won't all have it... In fact, most items don't never it. It's an extra line in yellow that sometimes appears.
---
My guess is it is related to some perk that gives you more scrap, but is bugged?
---
I was being harassed over xbox for not removing a clip on my console.

unyielding sentinel is the best you can possibly get, extremely expensive though. For power armor I would say t51b with emergency protocol.
---
This post is 76 days old üòé
---
Good point 
---
How expensive are we talking
---
I don‚Äôt blame you, although I watched a frog hop up my stairs and open the door, headed into one of the rooms turned around and left, didn‚Äôt even close the door behind him üôÑ
---
Fellow nerd here! Always ready to help!
---
Its the sheeple being mad that they died in thier videogame when they are just inferior m8. 
---
Holy shit, a real survival fan. Finally, I'm not alone on this sub.
---
Not that I know Of May be a glitch
---
it's the same chance on console
---
Ahhhh. Sooooo, it's random?
---
You can't put down now than two mines at a time.
---
Its possible that these plans are misnamed. I know one for sure is the the Vault tec bed, I bought both versions and says the same. I had heard of the barn wall being APC, but I I didn't know if the beds are having the same issue. Also one of cooking stations I can't build anymore, I built one and saved it when I moved my camp about a two weeks after release and I can no longer build that one in workshops, I'll have to play around with the ones I know i can't build to see if they did unlock something else. Thanks for the info I forgot about that mislabeled shenanigans 
---
Try taking the power plant workshops.  8 cores per hour now
---
Imagine banning people on the verge of quitting already due to lack of content and poor design choices, when you are already a niche game, with poor sales, and a monetization model that relies on people playing and spending money.
---
Ya but never Whitespring, I‚Äôve never dropped one, I think maybe that would be the location to do it at
---
I thought it was under perception? 
---
NO. FAST TRAVELING. 
---
Go play DayZ and understand how important this is to a survival game.

Hows about some PVE servers then that way people wouldn't have to post "telling" other people how to play?

starting fallout from the launcher at the same moment as i was adjusting my system volume during the scroll barrel caused the system to have an infinite volume down input, re-plugging the keyboard was the only solution. (tried restarting game etc, or manually sliding the volume mixer etc)

the initial start spike of fallout 76 is so hard it completely locks the system for a split moment (it feels, would love to know if i can measure this (i know to use resmon a bit?))

I found a stray Raider Power Armor but when I got inside it was a recording of a guy saying he was just going off to get some fusion cores because he was on his last one and he asked me to get out of it because he was coming back soon.
---
At this rate every new patch ia going to be a dupe fix...makes you wonder...
---
What setup are you using? I'm on xbox1 because that's what system I got it on, but I have very few drops running on 100mb download "peak"  in the middle of the Midwest.  I have used both wired and wireless connections tested since the game released.  I could understand the server drops being Bethesdas fault some of the time but I am curious if it could be your connection to the server too that's causing some of your disconnects.
---
Yes, I did, and the other two in the picture do show the 25 rad resistance.
---
yeah, according to my notes it's level 50 (I only have 1 lvl40 ledge). As you know, i can fit any mods for you so if you let me know what you want I can put it into my spreadsheet and tell you what materials I'll need. Pricewise, I'm fairly easy, would you like to make an offer for the gun and modding service?
---
You wanna find him that bad?
---
Argon lazors.
---
Strange, have you tried taking it off then relogging/ server swapping to see if it fixes it yet?
---
usually not a cap kind of trade, people want high end items for them. You could find two in game drop tse weapons before you find one piece of armor. Plain old unyielding is good too, str adds damage.
---
I‚Äôll take it off your hands. Wood armor is meta for sneaky snipers.
---
My idea is workshops can be claimed for 2 hrs every 24 hrs on a PVE server.
---
Ha! Nice. You've got quite the personality!
---
 hey op the link stopped working for me. Trying to find out what a cooking spit is
---
That is a bummer, wondering why so big? Server stability, turret range?
---
I have basically a square camp using maybe using 50% of what I could. I would like to see an option to reduce my camp size to just the area I am using at the time, might reduce the your camp can't be place crap a bit.
---
The Quest gave you plans to mod Wood Armor with a Shroud mod. There are currently no known plans to craft it. 
---
Unless something has changed in the last week or so. 
---
You're just the kind of nice person I would like to spend time with. Or maybe...just maybe you're lonely because you're a horrible person. I suppose the latter could be true.
---
Leave them 
---
I know for the MoM quest, you cannot make another GoM if you get rid of the first one, even if you bring a tattered dress to the fabricator
---
Everything you say or do in Fallout 76 your labeled a duper, everything you say or do in RL your labeled a racist...cant win haha
---
I mean I have a spare tse shotgun I could trade, would that and a few thousand caps do the trick do you think?
---
Every patch they will "say" we fixed it, just as they throw "stability improvements" on  to the bottom of the list of fixes.
---
We can only take what we see in game as proof, and after the last round of stability fixes and dupe fix's things just got worse :/
---
"you killed someone in a videogame therefore you're a horrible person and lonely in real life"
---
First 3 star I got in over a month and it was a junkies cultist blade with block defense damage reduction so I certainly hope so 
---
Personality isn't what matters here... thumbs do..
---
What's your psn I will play 
---
Aye i've already seen crippled gulpers its hilarious. But i was not trying to debate the effectiveness of the perk as thats clear as day it was more or less to shed some light on the misconceptions people make with the perk and to inform people who are looking for detailed information on the perk itself to get more consistent usage out of it as you would not believe how many people think it cripples all limbs upon reading the perk card if you just aim for the center mass. As for OB918 i would recommend a max accuracy shotgun over range for scorchbeasts i tend to have more luck hitting their wings mid-flight. Although to anyone reading this who has barely any points in strength for their build. I would still highly recommend the lightest shotgun you can get your hands on with this perk as a tool for dealing with certain enemies you might be struggling with. 
---
Give me patch nooooooootes!
---
Two fantastic suggestions! I've seen this suggested before and told the Dev's, I'll mention it again.
---
You don't know what "vast" is if you think 76 is too big to get across. It takes a minumum of 20 minutes to walk from edge to edge. That's NOTHING compared to DayZ, which is over an hour of real time. 
---
That is not always true. 3 of my friends have been banned by the same group of people. None have received an email why. Whoever initiated my groups ban has a bigger pull somehow. Which is gonna be investigated. 
---
It was only my second attempt (first solo attempt). I didnt have the Maknframe Core locations memorized so about 10-15 minutes is trying to find them (I encountered the bug where crafting them isn‚Äôt an option).
---
But I‚Äôd love to see your run of any Silo. If you‚Äôre fat why not throw your video out for us all to aspire to? I‚Äôd love to learn some tips from your gameplay.
---
Genericized trademarks function as an idiomatic expression. No reason to suspect a strong correlation with intelligence, be it positive or negative. Would it be fair to assume you are an inbred fascist solely because you used the figures of speech 'not holding my breath' and 'bandwagon'?
---
The amount? Yes. But not who gets what. If you join the event you get some seeds. If someone else finishes the event you may get some stamen. Doesn't always seem to give some stamen to the non-participants on the server, maybe about 80% of the time.
---
You taken the quest from the terminal at the Enclave yea?
---
Usually gives you a location on the map at least, if you leave it too long someone might get to it first naturally as they explore etc. If that's the case a quick server hop usually refresh's it.
---
I once had a level 100 with a 10 cap bounty get me (level 50) to kill him. I killed him and got 10 caps, he seeked revenge and got 67 from me with his TSE... wtf...
---
I guess you never heard of friends killing wanted friends to keep the caps between them.
---
I'd be careful at whitesprings with a mega sloth. Even tamed and at your camp it appears as hostile (its name is red) which means if any robots see it they will shoot and kill it. If a robot kills it then it permanently dies.
---
I say that from experience. I normally tell people to move to Whitesprings if they want to get rid of their pets :P
---
doubt it.
---
Bloody explosive Handmade would likely draw some attention or other none common items.  
---
I love the level 3 lockpicks. I‚Äôve gotten some of the best plans out of them. 
---
 Wouldn't it be nice if we were older ...
---
Are workshops those things that you pay 45 caps for so you then have to defend them so they can give you ores to waste your precious acid for materials that you throw away because you are not allowed to hoard more then 100? Yeah i remember now they being in the game.
---
Lol that's an interesting design. Yeah mines out by the road so anyone can use it...which in hindsight might not be the smartest move as I'm between to super mutant spawns
---
That‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm almost 400hrs in and while I haven‚Äôt spent a *ton* of time farming, I‚Äôve definitely  raided whitesprings a good amount. I‚Äôve never gotten misleveled loot. Only thing I can think of is humanoids will run and grab a ‚Äúbetter weapon‚Äù if there‚Äôs one nearby, even in bodies. Ghouls don‚Äôt use weapons though. So that doesn‚Äôt make sense. 
---
Hmm I‚Äôve got a store if tse weapons that I‚Äôve bought and a hunters long coat I bought off someone for dirt cheap
---
Hm, I am not so sure myself then. I have some armour pieces with that effect and now I think I should check mine haha, it sounds like a bug, if is reported then it‚Äôs just a waiting game till is fixed. 
---
That's what I heard. With the popularity of cryptids in WV they coulda done somethig awesome with a cult or some shit
---
With as much bitching as you do I doubt you ever served 
---
Againts high level enemies AA TS will probably surprass TSE.
---
I went thru the whole "i am become death" quest to the Charlie site, went thru the whole process of repairing shit, fighting bots and crap, then got to the end and was told i didn't have something...
---
You don't know what "vast" is if you think 76 is too big to get across. 
---
It takes a minumum of 20 minutes to walk from edge to edge. That's NOTHING compared to DayZ, which can take over an hour of real time.
---
76 does not need fast travel. You will never get a true appreciation fit the terrain if you leave it in.
---
Are you waiting to place points in your special's?
---
You have to spend them for the perk pack to unlock, they kinda level locked as well :/
---
Hey I‚Äôve got no problem with that, but the bounty system is there for a reason. So when the 220 runs up on a 40 and you can‚Äôt get away from the slaps they become a target for players who can contest that 220. That‚Äôs my only real complaint, the pacifist mode tidbit was just an addition to my story.
---
I have a lvl 91 deathclaw spawn under my base literally every server hop and every 15 minutes.
---
Not even exaggerating, he spawns there 100% of the time, always lvl 91.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Small Letters isn't the expensive one. Signs and Letters is. Don't know if that one can drop from events.
---
Quick, somebody 'whoosh' him! I would but I cannot be bothered to post anything on that sub right now.
---
The second hacking perk card is higher level than the first; they don't work like other multi-rank cards. It should be around your level though. Remember that even though you're level 22, you won't be able to access level 22 perks with points you've saved up.
---
Doesn't mean asking for PvE servers is somehow justified. Remember when this game first dropped? People were being crucified for critiquing it because it 'wasn't what they expected'. Welcome to the club, you get to suck it up with the critics and deal with what Bethesda said they want the game to be.
---
The Missile would just go straight up and straight down. Or maybe it doesn't launch at all, it just explodes on the spot.
---
Try fast travelling nearby and then planning your attack.
---
You know, like any intelligent person would do
---
After I stopped claiming workshops, powering power plants and crapped all PA HUD I had no crash or disconnect in 15 hours. Before my PS4 logged 121 crashes.
---
I never made the first one.  I got the blade and the ra, but never had to make the garb.   I only knew about the garb when I tried to use RA and it said I need to equip garb.  Had to look it up to even see what it is.  
---
At one point I was getting like two off every other ghoul but since one of the patches we got what we have today. A what feels like a 90 percent chance of getting a one star armor pieces l regardless the legendary 
---
Keep your eye out, ive traded for a vanguard sentinel for 500 caps. I just got lucky and the guy didn't know it's worth. 
---
TBF I believe they're working as intended. It used to be a much higher drop rate, before the first duping exploit came about.
---
Yeah, I always accept.  Unless we're running around the same area (I prefer solo with my lone wanderer).  I figure it's just for fast travel.  I accept, once I see they've traveled, I leave group.  It's the nice thing to do.
---
#THE BEST PLACE FOR SUPER DUPER DEALS!
---
I think he means, people would build big bases, which would end up causing lag. Not build to cause lag. This is a problem in a survival games like Conan Exiles where they introduced "the purge" to destroy huge bases if you cant protect them. The purge is a mob attack on a base after a set size or time.
---
Once you have the keycard the silos are best done solo, much easier than group I find, take out turrets quick then Gutsys and assaultrons, not that many turn up solo, seriously it's nothing to sweat about...just have good sledge/melee with you.
---
Do as someone who farms rgese reguarlay fir outfits to sell. They used to be there all the time. Now they spawn more rare. Sometimes i get none 2 or 3 server hops in a row. Then i will see 1 or 2. But i occasionally still see 4 at a time in the desks. Ypu xan still get them from server hopping though. They just dint spawn as often.
---
That's why they should be perma banned.
---
Ah, my assumption is then that you can't make one at all after completing that mission. That sucks. What system are you on, I'll give you mine
---
balls, never mind, no doubt someone would want it if you don't. It's very popular with the pvp bros...
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think that should be the system when resources aren‚Äôt as easily attained/managed due to the weight system. PvP is fine with my, I like the idea. But I also like that the high levels that play the raider game get the targets on their back. This specific instance the high level player slapped me down to the point that I had to use 2 Stimpacks so I didn‚Äôt die with a full inventory of loot. (I died anyway when I tried to turn the fight with a surprise TS the dragon lol)
---
I used WiFi for the first day of playing Fallout 76 and I was getting dc'd every half hour it seemed. I decided to go buy a lan cable. Since then I've had one, maybe two, since. I strongly urge everyone to try this.
---
Level 86, only seen Stalking mothman, and Wise Mothman at the path to enlightenment event
---
Why not just have a larger, brighter flies animation and have it appear over any corpse.  Half the things in this game glow so make glowing flies.  It would be easy to spot, thematic, and it would look cool.
---
I would absolutely love to see Ferret Baudoin &amp; Jeff Gardiner do a "lore" stream, or two. Going behind the scenes into how the story was developed, exploring places the community seems to have missed but the Devs love, and going deeper into the events that resonate with the community (the story of BOS defeat in the glassed cavern seems universally beloved) to explain different iterations of those quests.
---
ESO has done similar things and I'd watch the heck out of a 76 stream.
---
https://youtu.be/V6wsifOX_qQ
---
Also please stream them on YouTube for us non-twitchers.
---
Please and thank you :)
---
U very likely missed a step in a mission. If ure on pc, i can give you that card
---
We have the green fireflies....use those.
---
Hey man I'll be on tonight at 10 or so eastern time if your available i gave all my flux to my friend and when you log in he's gonna be in the team and ready to trade when your ready 
---
I'm not reddit technical support. You'll have to work out how to get the link to the video to copy the file so you can paste it in here but just saying that it's doable.
---
Good luck if you're looking to paste the link!
---
I figure i can start from the beginning on it, and kinda trace my steps. I am on sexbox sadly.
---
I live there, you should come visit, I'll show you round! And keep plugging away on the legendaries, you'll get one sooner or later. I find i get better loot when i'm teamed up so that's my top tip for you!
---
Well I remember a patch note once saying they fixed drops but I remember the language sounding like they were increasing drops due to some bug. 
---
The whole star system seems pointless if it doesn't feel like its making any difference which version I find
---
Not sure what you are into but for me The Division 2 and Anthem is dropping soon so I may take a short break soon outside of my daily chill out sessions after work.
---
Basically me playing minecraft / stardew valley in FO76 (farming, selling, cooking, tweaking my CAMP).
---
My serious gaming sessions will probably be TD2 and Anthem until the next big drop in March.
---
I've been playing on PC since launch and to me the servers have been fairly stable, glitches are getting fewer and further apart and I look forward to seeing each new patch and bug fix. But then again, everyone's experience is different.
---
Yeah, I'm sure someone inside Bethesda has some personal interest in banning random players.
---
I got the datamined mod info and worked out which mod was which and made a spreadsheet :)
---
Fair enough, I had it happened and freaked out for various reasons (namely that I use sound over rides so certain screamybois don't cause me physical pain with their screams
---
Ah... If that's it then that makes sense. Perhaps I read the details wrong.
---
At the end you need a code and a keycard.
---
7. Logout timer to counter Combat Logs
---
My friend just looked in the Cabinet in the presidential bunker, he saw something called Presidential Salopettes, I told him to pick them up, he had a look round the room first then came back to the cabinet and it was gone, no proof but he couldn‚Äôt have just made that up xD  
---
Yeah i mean the terminal which gives you the missions for the codes (as well as the nuke card locations), think I am become death can be active without picking one of these up.
---
Its been a while as the code pieces aren't needed an you end up collecting quite a few nuke cards just running round and keeping an eye out for cargo bots etc.
---
Go check the terminal, it should give you a mission to a cargo bot location.
---
The small letters are the cheap version. I think the neon ones are the 11k ones
---
yup, the uninformed really look down on it but hey, it's their loss!
---
That was the one that decreased the drop rate unfortunately.
---
3\*'s certainly have a higher chance of obtained 3\* equipment, but i've seen posted around that any legendary can drop any \* amount.
---
Very nice! I like how you incorporated an existing house. 
---
You sir, are hero.
---
I think you're confusing keycards with something else.
---
Shit thank you so much!
---
My wish if nothing else that the Queen drops something other than plans for Ultracite explosive vent.
---
Can only imagine if that streamer actually saw a UFO or something, his head almost exploded at someone wearing a garbage can!
---
Agreed. Im level 97 and like helping low levels. Some people are just pricks.
---
Wow that‚Äôs nice of you.  I am on Xbox, but won‚Äôt be on till later tonight.   I just wanted to see it since I did all the leg work. 
---
You got two? 
---
Oh you lucked out and found a 3 star legendary. Here have a 1 star piece of wood armor.
---
Check whitesprings resort. One of the vendors seems to have it all the time, 800+ caps with no discount.
---
On XB or I would help you out.
---
Believe me, there is nothing more boring than a QA session. I wouldn't mind though for some teaser streams, like the entrance room of a new vault, building with new items from the shop, or something like that.
---
I didn't know i wanted it....now i do!
---
The thing is with these changes its not a massive amount. Even if they increase the camp limit by 20% it should not put as much strain on the server.
---
Well at least in terms of weapons, this is not the game you can do that sort of thing right now.
---
You're best off just selling or junking those weapons because by the time you get to the level that you can use them, you'll find equal or better weapons at that time. 
---
Sadly you have to let go of your hoarding instincts. It's counter-productive for this game in its current state.
---
If they allow for more stash storage or, as you've posted, add in non-stash containers (something I'd like to see to, even if it's in a limited capacity) then maybe but even then we just can't hoard like we use in past games.
---
I did the nuke yesterday on one of my characters.  FYI, in case you didn't know, any codes you picked up from a scorched officer expire on sundays  at midnight (ET US I believe).  So you have to have a new code starting mondays.   I don't believe that the authorization cards you get from vertibots expire though.
---
You need both the card from the vertibot, and the code you can get for your specific site.   There are a few sites that have the decoded launch code for each week too
---
Hmmm, sounds like you are referring to Sunnytop Station just West of Sunnytop Ski Lanes. I'll have to go check it out. Thanks!
---
It's a plan called " Signs and Letters". Sold by Graham and randomly by vendor bots. Costs 12k caps but you can lower the price with the "hard bargain" perk, grape mentats and high charisma.
---
nps :)
---
It is pathetic isn't it. PvP is not destroying someone's camp, and PvP is not a one-sided reckoning, like this game makes it. It's more griefing than PvP. It's an "I can destroy this and I will". Hopefully they make raiding on the PvP server better than the default servers. I wish you joined a server from the menu and chose Raider, or Survivor. So you know who to look out for. Survivors being passive and not as easy to have camps destroyed, and Raiders is a name to anyone that's not passive and has the ability to cause damage and kill. Not all raiders will raid, just more able to do so. Survivors are pacifist PvE players, Raiders are aggressive/defensive, and retaliatory in nature, with the ability to PvP other Raiders mainly. Also the option to be a Raider or Survivor being only available from the menu, thus preventing side flipping in game.
---
Sounds like something a synth would say while trying to sound human :-|
---
Sadly no, I feel your pain though.
---
A lot of the time the queen dies in few mins. I've several times been too late for the party when it's about 5 mins into the event, could only kill some normal SB and other lesser things.
---
I would not be really worried. It will take more time, it should take more time.
---
Many times it's so easy people won't even care about more advanced tactics.
---
Honestly, I would be down to have this. Mothmen must've been worshipped by the cult for a reason, right? So it would make sense that reason would be them providing blessings.
---
Ballistic fiber
---
I have high luck and seem to find them at a decent rate. Not sure it effects that but it seems to help.
---
Ahh ok my bad

Well a few are legendaries and I can‚Äôt scrap them and they sell for close to nothing so both aren‚Äôt worth it even though they have decent legendary mods
---
I have no clue what you could mean... ; )
---
Ghouls also don't use armor and yet they drop both armor and weapon loot. What is your point?
---
I‚Äôm swimming in the rest of my junk, keep an excel workbook to manage weight and see what‚Äôs taking up how much, and yet after two repairs, I‚Äôm down to 5 ballistic scrap...
---
Use a Karma syringer on her. Yeah she is stupid hard to kill at first but then she gets super squishy.
---
Haha, in 52 levels, I've gotten two non-melee/pipe weapons. One'a lvl 25 2* explosive laser rifle, and I just got a 1* hunter's black powder pistol. 
---
I was so excited about the pistil.
---
I wish that blue wood and doorframe was something you could build with 
---
Lol you had to work hard for those 12k caps?
---
Secret room?
---
See I used to think that before that patch. I would come away from a whitesprings run with 30 legendaries. Now I'm lucky if I get anything
---
Good riddance. We're all sure you're lying by the way.
---
Ya, not sure then.
---
Definately this. I'm not complete until I've left every terminal/door/safe open behind me.
---
Hold on. Even without reading your post, on title alone, if you hated the game before to the point that you're STILL hating it now, why the hell are you even playing the game?
---
You don't see someone like Angry Joe tear the game a new arsehole with his review and then continue to play the game while hating on it while doing so.
---
Maybe consider just letting go and moving on to play other games. Probably more beneficial for your mental health.
---
My teammates and I have spots spread out on the map.  Makes it a lot cheaper to fast travel around.  I wish I could build in a more populated area.  I never lock my CAMP or workshops for that matter.  I'd love people to come visit and use my stuff. 
---
Will this fix the phantom stored camp budget? This should be a priority!!
---
I hear that sometimes they find people to come back and help them retake their workshop by force. That gives me the idea that if you want to offer your services, in-game, you should put your camp near a popular location and put up letting on the side that says what services you provide. In this case, mercenaries to help low-level (or poorly optimized) players kick someone else's ass.
---
I had a guy with an open mic and his tv volume up to 11 so much echo and his gunshots were so much louder. 
---
Usually, that ash pile would have Mothman wing fragments and neurotoxin dust but it might've glitched out and not dropped anything due to there being a different loot from a glowing enemy.
---
Are you on PC? I would love to have a Jason show up to my base in the woods when I least expect it. üòÇ
---
Ic. Your right about the mixing. They should.
---
It's toxic to hope that Bethesda bans the people who took part in the market of duped goods?
---
You know who doesn't ask the question the OP asked? People who don't suspect they have duped items. They bought an item in good faith, and had no reason to suspect it was duped.
---
You know what kind of person asks the question "Will I get banned for having duped items?" (Not "I'm worried that I may have bought a duped items".... The phrasing of the OP's question suggests he KNOWS he has duped items and is worried. )
---
The kind of people who ask that question are dupers, friends of dupers and customers of dupers.
---
Not some unlucky smuck who just traded for an item and it was duped unknowingly. 
---
Also, I'm impressed with how you came to confront my "toxic" attitude, by in turn being toxic. I'm impressed you can ride that high horse..... Especially with your head so far up your own ass. 
---
Hit me up I'll be one in about 3 hrs
---
extremelylost 
---
Yet, designed, and CAN be done. 
---
800 rubber too
---
50 caps for them spinning arrows 
---
I see plenty. Rarely pick any up since so many are half or so. I'd only trade them anyway.
---
I love helping out other players and I spend about 80% of my time when I‚Äôm on doing that, I can‚Äôt imagine destroying other peoples CAMPs or just killing them for the lolz. Just gutted it happened to my friend more than anything 
---
I don't love the paired unarmed necessarily... could you imagine two bladed mole miner gauntlets?  You wouldn't be able to see... as it stands weapons take up way too much visibility on the screen.  I'd love to be able to lower my weapons.  Just see the tip of what I'm wielding.  If I really want to admire it, I'll go third person.  
---
Also, missile launchers need a HUGE damage boost.  I remember the first time I was able to fire one and I was giddy with the anticipation of blowing something up!  Boy was I underwhelmed... for 3lbs each, missiles should do WAY more damage.
---
Also, Also, why is it that molotov cocktails use beer bottles when they look like and clearly say "Vodka" on them?
---
The repairs are unreal i imagine
---
Maybe you should go re-watch that Gillette ad ;-)
---
I‚Äôve found that looking away and then back at your kill will cause the loot to load properly.
---
Are there any other sources for this original meaning of F2P?
---
Awe, I love this so much! :)
---
I have five bug reports on broken/bugged equipment in the last 2.5 months.  Not only have they not fixed any of the legitimate problems I have reported, the only response I have gotten is a canned reply, and summary closing of my issue.
---
So I won't hold my breath.
---
Seriously ... been looking for those forever also!!  Understand that they won‚Äôt drop after Lvl 40 
---
Well yeah. To each their own. I won't begrudge someone for having fun with the game as is. :)
---
No loot, move on and try again :(
---
Bethesda "It just works" :/
---
thx - i scrapped so many diff types of guns
---
Better weapon.
---
Ah this reminded me of the themes Moira sold at Megaton. Having theme packs in the atomic store would probably sell really well, a collection of furniture+decorations to make your settlement fit with your character
---
Ive tried. Ive tried looking at the map, looking away and back, looking at my inventory, pressing A, pressing X....i really dont wanna lose this
---
They should totally setup a donation drop-off spot where people can drop off their unwanted items (that can be resold for caps).
---
?
---
I didn;t know there were Glowing Scorchbeasts 
---
Im sure the 3 guys, with no email in thier inboxes from encountering the same group of players agree.
---
I get this on XB1, without using any power armor at all.
---
I used to be an adventurer before I took a spinning arrow to the knee. 
---
I have screenshots and evidence on imgur
---
None of them are particularly "hard" to get. Some are just extremely tedious. There are spots you can server swap to farm just about everything. Ballistic fiber is a pain in the ass because the best farming spot is Fort Defiance. You can get *some* at For McClintock, but only a couple. 
---
Yeah just make the game you like die out quicker. 
---
Oh poor you 
---
What's your in game name? I'll put in a good word...
---
Unless you're within 1-2 levels of those legendaries, they're just dead weight in the stash. 
---
Trust me, as a fellow hoarder, you're better off with the meagre caps you get for it than the utility it takes up in terms of what you can stash. 
---
It might seem counter-intuitive but junk is one of the most precious resources in the game. Likely even above those legendary weapons you're hoarding.
---
Well, if his "joke" was supposed to be funny, I didn't quite find it so.
---
We need to get you on the dev team to help get the ideas put into game
---
You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs 100% griefing and it‚Äôs ridiculously pathetic. I like and would back the idea of the raider/survivor servers. I‚Äôm not really sure why they didn‚Äôt just do something like that from the get go as almost everyone I‚Äôve met online refuses to take part in PvP as it‚Äôs not what fallout is about. There‚Äôs enough things in the game trying to kill you never mind having to worry about players who are just bored. 
---
I really have had a mostly positive experience online til tonight so I guess I‚Äôm lucky. It‚Äôs just really sad as it‚Äôs kind of put me off a little bit 
---
I had that issue too, I had to unequip them both from the crafting menu, then reequip the one I wanted. It then moved the spare pieces to my inventory.
---
How much (roughtly)? As Im the one getting killed I don't know.
---
I‚Äôm at about 4-5 levels from the main one I want but anything more that 10 gets sold
---
I added in a link for your viewing pleasure.
---
Happy birthday to me :(
---
heck, just place a marker over all \*unlooked\* corpses lootable by you in a small radius of like 10 meters if you want.
---
it would make the game so much better....
---
i have disabled fog and grass with the damn ini file because i lost loot on a SQ 2 times now cuz the blood pile was unable to find (we were under HEAVY assault when we finished the queen, one of the best fights ever imho, 15 100+ lvls, no insane dps tricksters)
---
If you nuke them, they turn into the intelligent form of ghouls... like you never nuked Megaton...  Moira Brown took it like a champ!  They could come from that vault down south... 63?  Too lazy to look it up.  
---
I am a supporter of fallout which is why I've put so much money and effort into this game I have beaten every fallout game that has ever came out and unlocked every achievement for every fallout 
---
Will you take a level 50 set? I could sell it for 1750 maybe
---
How about some paints for guns
---
Farm the heck out of steel too 
---
At level 20 all the gatling gun is going to do is weigh you down :(
---
ya i pretty much have everything from it, multiple bomber jackets, bos paint plans, scribe outfits, combat armors, etc... but after awhile, what good is more of it.  i'm not a trader so I just dump the stuff in train stations.
---
fun bug though.  i wonder if it will get fixed in tomorrows patch.
---
That is awesome! Sure thing I would definitely be interested in those.
---
Sure. It is not inherently funny, but it is an obvious South Park reference and some people are into that.
---
Marsupial mutation - bird bones if you can take the negative str
---
Yuo
---
Are you some how trying to imply gender has something to do with telling Bethesda we need PVE servers?
---
No I‚Äôm only level 37
---
Thanks üëç
---
Ok, suit yourself dude but in my experience that's too long of a time to use them. I haven't regretted a single legendary I've dumped that wasn't within a level or 2 reach of usage, even some of those with good legendary effects.
---
However, you do you.
---
I have bit of arthritis in my hands as well  and this quest is supposed to optional
---
either give us another way to get  a  military ID 
---
and  let us use   vats in the marksman's course or increase the times 
---
That's a pretty well known classical song.  Not everything is an Easter egg.
---
I've traveled far enough down this rabbit hole and I'm very late for an important date.
---
Right, right. So now you are basically saying that 3 guys encountered devs, or some people close to the devs, and they are banned because they pissed them off?
---
I've heard that story so many times in so many games, and not a single time has it been true.
---
The "Outdoorsman" vendor your talking about always has 3 rug plans for me at 300 caps.
---
Oh well I‚Äôve only heard of it throughout the evil within üò≠
---
I'm not defending the kid, simply speaking my mind. Tho this conversation has been quite entertaining. Also sorry for the delay with my response, left work and got a haircut. Do you think it makes me look cute?
---
If you're curious, here are some screen shots with the exact details:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/x2xMJx8](https://imgur.com/a/x2xMJx8)
---
I never replied to the harassment messages but got over 13 of them from the people harassing me
---
You are like those people that get captured in the medieval times waiting for the executioner to cut your head off sitting there helpless and crying without atleast putting up a dying fight
---
Anyone can access the switch. 
---
In real life what is stopping me from walking up to the fuse box connected to the outside of your house and killing the power. Hypothetically of course. 
---
This time there is proof. 
---
Same. There isn't much benefit to PvP, the griefer gets nothing from the camp, and if the owner retaliates tgen the griefer makes caps. The owner just gets punished. 
---
Thanks a bunch for the feedback :)
---
*Just here for the duped comments*
---
What are you talking about? You're such a child
---
Are you telling me you can build a camp on top of an existing house?  Can you add walls, doors, etc?
---
Mind blown...
---
I'm lv 90, never thought of trying that
---
An amount equal to your level, the amount is paid for from your own caps
---
The beginning  is bad but it gets better
---
No. Better move along before the diehard fan boys come in here because sadly.... no.
---
nope. Mach 3 for me.
---
if you bring me the mats i can craft you one for 500 caps
---
Lot of good points there.  
---
I just leveled a new heavy gunner and ya, it's messy.  I didn't receive a single heavy gunner perk card until 40, then not another one until after 50.  Interesting.  I used a lvl20 two shot gat, which was a beast, but almost impossible to keep supplied with ammo.
---
BTW, Combat Dense Torso is not learnable by scrapping.  Plan only.
---
I agree strongly with the majority of your post, well done.
---
I have five as well, but they live on a platform with fencing and a missile turret to watch over them. So far, they only die when they somehow jump over the fence and fall 500 feet to their messy demise.
---
I'm sorry sir. r/Fallout is down the hall, past the toilets.
---
I had to wait like 10 mi utes for loot to load the first time. 
---
Level 300 and don't have the 50 caps or whatever to fast travel across the map? Like, are your caps not capped already?
---
and your the one that got the ban....that's messed up!
---
Bethesda support might be able to  help you out, i hear they got a good customer service team!
---
It's only today because it's the day before a patch. She's also been around for awhile.
---
I have all those mods and I'm PS4 you could've just hmu.
---
I've had this kinda happen where a group of players teamed up before but I just killed them all the same.  Explosive weapons are kinda OP.
---
Yeah Myron, that little shit
---
Killed one of those yesterday. It dropped the saddest Assassin's chest piece ever, lol. 
---
I've called Bethesda support and submitted multiple tickets about my account and still have had zero reply and bethesda support over the phone told me they do not offer support and have to wait for an email which I still have not recieved 
---
I hope they add more color options to that barn building set and barn set need different window options too
---
Get on the mic and use emo to initiate pvps. Using home invasion as a starter? I wouldn‚Äôt like that.
---
ohno
---
Honestly never even seen that. Amazing that there are still details like that in the game after ten years of playing it
---
Idk ... I guess it depends on what you like ... there‚Äôs certainly a lot to do and a lot of grinding for scrap and legendary gear ... if that‚Äôs your thing the probably now ... story line is actually pretty cool if you follow it ... don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs your play style so your mile may vary
---
Take a power plant workshop and power up the plant. I've got 28 100/100 fusion cores in my stash right now just from doing that a couple times.
---
Best advice? Nuka cola grenade under your feet...
---
You‚Äôll die but you‚Äôll take those bastards with you.
---
depends on you. i enjoyed the game but got  bored off it after my 3 month grind fest. finally got plat on ps4 so im done with the game till new dlc comes out  
---
Thank you! I love and appreciate you.
---
Please tell me you didn't get an explosive vent plan lol
---
Hey, look mom, Im being downvoted by people who havent realized we were scammed out of our money!
---
but the whole point of the item is wasted then, if the switch and keypad do the same thing and can both be used by anyone it defeats the point of the keypad. 
---
As soon as i joined a team it fixed
---
A pvp-only server sounds fun, the game just is not in the roght place for that yet. 
---
Weapons needs more balancing, as you‚Äôve already stated. If a player can port over their hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads that stack, what is the point? 
---
It‚Äôs be nice to have a buff for a change. I wonder what the issues are surrounding plasma/laser. A decimal point in the wrong place? Remember the infamous 2000% VATS accuracy in fo4? Is something similar happening here with just bad maths? 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I just found the price I‚Äôm going to delegate this post now
---
I believe bloodied will have more raw damage at the max boost but it requires a very specific glass cannon build. TSE is universal damage, it deals the same to all enemies no matter what you are doing or what your build is, and it's still going to be about the same. People are forgetting that explosive procs per projectile, so TS still doubles the boost from explosive, while neither AA or bloodied do that
---
Code pieces from officers expire, cards can only 'expire' if you enter a wrong code.
---
Ah no, I got a grognak axe, lever action rifle, ultracite arms plan and other things. 
---
That's why I said you should get the powered door with keypad access. The switch is on the other side of the door so people cant walk up to it unless they jump through a window or something. 
---
Thank you üòä 
---
I've killed her about 35 times and half of those were before I had any explosive/two shot weapons, so I'm not really sure why everyone is so concerned that she will be unkillable.
---
A lot of heavy weapons namely the minigun, lmg, and gatling require them to be TSE or don't bother using them. Even then they disappoint in pvp and sbq fights. Definitely needs a buff
---
Don't waste your time on it...I thought it was going to be something I hadn't seen or known about for 90 days already....just trash common farm spots. At least show them the secret concert area with all the hats or the area that has a bunch of outfits.  Or how about the hidden cave down south with a bunch of cool shit. 
---
I had mine totally screwed up by the time o hit 50.  74 now and have ironed everything out.  At lower levels you are kinda at the mercy of random perk packs.
---
I was going to start over until i found uot you can move points around after level 50.
---
Kind of forgot about that, yeah a tse minigun probably shreds. Does it break instantly though like the others?
---
Also not that hard to come by, especially if you genocide a whole bunch of mole miners and scrap their filters/breathers.
---
Dupers would have resources in the tens of thousands, orders of magnitude more than a few hundred.
---
you got BGSd.  Happens to everyone eventually, sorry :(
---
Yeah better weapon ... Tesla rifle works well on lower level trash mobs and does a great job tagging higher level enemies (handy for white springs). I‚Äôd get some pump shot guns and scrap a bunch until you get enough mod to get max damage, ammo capacity and reload speed... just my $.02 worth anyway
---
Yeah, but if you exit the power armor you'll have to do the whole rigmarole again.
---
i.e. Hopping out to craft, cook food, modify equipment, sleep, etc will require you to re-equip your armor, then PA, quit, and then rejoin.
---
Definetly bad sources then. 
---
lucky mofo!
---
Not the point. I paid good caps for those and don't deserve to be screwed over. That's all I'm saying. 
---
upload to youtube, post link?
---
Only if we get a "this building should be condemned and razed"
---
what ya get?
---
Thank you, I just wanted to say that this recent communication and direction in fixes is phenomenal. 
---
Do you have white knight on when you repair?
---
Someone posted a Level 91 Scorched Deathclaw pet earlier. Its' name was Gary. 
---
Thanks so much for that :)
---
Never mind the fact that I couldn't use any of it because it was all lvl 50.
---
I buy ballistic fibre in bulk from vendors when I see it
---
260c or so
---
My friend and I also had some luck with heart of the swamp - he got the leather coat for it on his first attempt doing the event üòÇ
---
We love and appreciate you all as well!
---
So they are random ... ok that helps but I must say I‚Äôm kind of enjoying going through the quests again ... this time more slowly and reading everything in the note and on computers .... I‚Äôm only lvl 12 so who know once I hit 15 I might be able to score some elusive handmade rifle plans!!
---
Nope I don't have those yet, I chose to max fix it good and weapon artisan first. It'll be on the list next
---
Don't know, but I Blocked some idiot the other day, who started attacking me when I was at a trader in a train station.   He started hitting me with his knife for no reason.  I then went to the workbench, and he came there and started to attack me again.   I didn't see him on the map after I blocked him
---
Oh i have the caps......i also got lil jew in me ya know wat im sayinüòÇüòÇüòÇ....like
---
Yeah that is odd, wondering though. Have you modded either pieces at all? 
---
Oh yeh i member lol
---
Thanks for the input, I'll think about it.
---
Talking to people in real life is optional. 
---
Tomorrow morning, my friend! 
---
Also dont run around looking for cores.....well youll see in the vid. Kisses
---
Shredding Miniguns aren't quite as bad as you describe, but yes, you should be able to play for a couple hours with any weapon without it breaking. I always make sure to carry three miniguns with me into Queen fights, and I dont use them for mobs, only the queen. I had a run last week where I only broke one minigun in the queen fight.
---
Yep and Executing-E will probably be a contender after 40% hp. 
---
But I think bloodied will be best overall, assuming you can deal with being near death all the time.
---
&gt;turret range
---
Maybe it would be something like [Jail Gun Turrets from Idiocracy](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-15-2015/Q18WCC.gif)
---
Sorry but it got left in the trash can
---
Just buff the damage
---
The every 5 level card packs are random. The cards you pick per level come at specific intervals. For example Super Duper comes at level 50. I think you might get lucky and get it early in a card pack, but dont rely on that. 
---
My advice is:
---
1) decide what you want to be play style wise...
---
2) pick cards that support that style
---
3) damage first
---
4) life comforts 2nd
---
5) Get the biggest bang for your buck
---
6) adjust after 50.
---
So for me, I went pure melee. I then decided punching and 2 handed were my style. I then picked slugger level 1. I waited for expert slugger and master slugger as the first level gives you +10% and the later levels are just +5%. I then picked things that helped me survive.. stuff like cannibal, sneak, marathoner and so on. I also picked some key crafting stuff to make good weapons. 
---
Once i hit level 50 I moved some skill points around and refined other selections. Like I now have barbarian at 3 star and dumped incisor because I push out 1K damage, and armor has yet to negate that. I one punch level 91 death claws, but my life is low due to nerd rage and radicool. 
---
Yes, that would be nice. So many times I have scraped all the junk just to realize all the   prescious goo gone.
---
Yeah a WOODEN one star at that
---
This is why I‚Äôm going to dismantle my very nice CAMP and go with a 1 or 2 foundation-sized construct.  I‚Äôll store the basics (bed, workbenches, etc.) while I‚Äôm away.  I‚Äôll just place whatever workbench I need before storing it again. 
---
I‚Äôm so tired of the griefing.  
---
1st world problems!
---
How's it look with the 1070?
---
There are things to do in the mid-game but it's truly not worth it as there is absolutely no end-game. Steer far away from this game. There are so many better games out there. Play those. Come back to this in around 8 months. Take it from a lvl 185.
---
It happens to me as well (PC). it is annoying as it keeps agility drained until I manage to panic out of it and obviously it makes hell of a noise as well (high speed noise of trying to activate vats with no AP). 
---
Ive had my legit trader character attacked multiple times. I dont get it. I dont even have multiples of anything.
---
Finally found a possible reason I can't repair my precious Instigating Handmade.  Fingers crossed!
---
Next she needs to try rust....
---
r/IAmVerySmart
---
Good luck I hope it works for you üòÅ
---
Wont work, it seems tame only works whit non scripted aleatory spawns, at least tryed whit animal friend didnt even show pacify
---
I think it is the influx of lower level players that show up and scale her health really high. 
---
At times I feel like I need to do the damage of 3 people, to make up for all of the level 30s and lower who show up and contribute nothing. 
---
It sounds harsh, but dumping a couple thousand or so ammo just to fail, feels bad man. 
---
Especially when the times we succeed or get close to succeeding, she glitches out (flies away out of the map, body disappears, loot won't load, disconnects). 
---
I mean, you call it trash, but did you check the other effects? If it's sentinel's that shit is currently the most sought after piece of armor in the game. Nobody will care about it being wood when it gives them 135% damage resistance in PvP
---
Bitch the game's been out for 3 months, they couldn't have fixed all of the bugs by now but they've fixed hundreds of them. They've said they're trying to increase server stability and have responded with the community's complaints on PvP character migration. The bugs do take one day to fix, usually less but we're not going to get a new patch every day for each bug. It's a system we're talking about you know.
---
lmao that's amazing.
---
Tbh I don't think you should get a bounty for picking doors or extractors. You should get a notice your stuff is being broken into. I like the idea of a cutpurse robbing your workshop if you can't be bothered to defend it.
---
pics or didnt happen :v, tested it whit animal friend, didnt work.
---
Question is when is the bloody and unyielding nerf?
---
That's actually a cool idea. Could at least change it to something a little brighter and easier to spot when you're desperately scrounging to get your 2 hours worth of valuable scrap back.
---
Got any Handmade plans?
---
\^ this has been my experience too
---
If you're selling it I'd definitely be interested in buying it
---
3 patches after TSE nerf but 12 patches before bobblehead/mag stacking nerf
---
I'll you your left arm if its level 50
---
Don‚Äôt now what you missing! The adrenaline rush of whether you going to get a disconnect, server not responding, infinite loading screen, frozen in place, CTD or blue screen, and that‚Äôs just in the first 5 minutes of loading!
---
Good ideas
---
That's quite alright! 
---
 So it‚Äôs used to make overdrive? 
---
I have experienced this a crapload of times on my non-PA VATS gunslinger alt. Super annoying. XB1
---
Uh, how does agility increase run speed?  Doesn't it just give you more AP so you run longer?
---
If you didn't see a nerf coming, you're kinda dumb. 
---
NmüòÇ I actually went there and it was there sorry
---
You need different weapons for different situations. I usually roll with at least two different types of weapons, depending mostly on combat range and whether or not I have a desire for stealth. But you're going to need something a bit quicker for dealing with hordes of melee beasts.
---
This. I dont know what I just did recently, maybe the better stuff (brick walls) takes up less space, better space managment, who knows, I just know that what I built yesterday is like a castle in comparison to the wood wall structures Ive been bulding. 
---
If we're being honest though, most folks (before the player base dropped by like 40%) that were ever running a super meta marsupial melee build were definitely also dupers. It's the same mentality that makes both things appealing. You can't honestly tell me you planned on playing a character in a fallout game that jumps 30 feet in the air and fights everything with a hammer. Don't try, you'll be lying. 
---
No why
---
Wouldn't that be an interesting thing to see.
---
Are there still duplication glitches in the game? I thought the new hardcore mode was a golden opportunity to cleanse much of the player base of all those exploited bobbleheads, magazines, weapons, etc. from the game. New character creation seemed like a no brainer to me. At this point I don‚Äôt even know what their goals or incentives are for the game. Last week‚Äôs ITV erased all illusions of future greatness for this game in my mind. It‚Äôs a shame because I used to love Bethesda‚Äôs brand and I thought this game would launch with lessons taken from ESO. 
---
I want to agree but with each patch the game stability is worse not better, I really hope tomorrow‚Äôs patch is a game changer.
---
Might be some shared back-end code/infrastructure change that requires all platforms to update at the same time.
---
Yes, it would be nice for my time to be best spent actually playing the game, and not lurking trade forums for my only possible upgrades. 
---
It's happened to me. I just go to my map and out and its good
---
How does that work?  If someone attacks him does he fight back?
---
I'm high enough now that I feel like even a lv 91 dearhclaw would be really easy to kill, but against a lowbie maybe he'd be good deterrence?
---
Congratz btw
---
I only buy them because all the other non CAMP stuff is crap. But I do agree. atom stuff shouldn‚Äôt have a impact towards camp budget. Or at least reduced.
---
**[PSA]** We will start working on the ***Community patch notes*** as soon as we can get the files. We also plan to live stream our whole workflow for those that want to take a look in the inside of the engine and answer questions on how things work.  
---
You can always find the latest notes at &lt;https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/&gt;
---
Technically, jumping is standing, just moving up and down while doing it.  And "moving" means moving across xy coordinates.
---
How about they just fix the description if that's what's making you salty?  Not that I care either way, I don't do any PVP, this just seems like nitpicking.
---
No, loot was there, reached for my phone to snap a pic and after his death animation, empty :'(
---
Not sure tbh, I assumed it would be upping my run speed. Not really checked it out and have a few variables going on the now lol. 
---
Wood can only have one effect 
---
&gt; Bitch the game's been out for 3 months
---
I wish I could work to such low expectations and lax timeframes...
---
Except .308 Ultracite comes in significantly higher quantities than normal .308 when comparing it to other examples.
---
Yep, that's moving across xy coords.
---
I would say Flux because you 3 materials Flux, Hardened Mass and Glowing mass to stablize it. First violet, then crimson, then calbolt and then the last two.
---
Not overly difficult, just more tedious .. maybe ballistic fibre if you a armour user, doesn't matter much to PA users.
---
Dupers? DEY TUK ER JOBS!
---
I don't understand how you find PVP fun at all in this game or take it so seriously.
---
Not even worth reading after your first suggestion, tbh. 
---
the budget is fine just reduce the amount turrets take up
---
Duper Confirmed
---
I do feel better, because when you complain and lose your items, im sitting fine with mine. Ill sell them to you for $50. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That's funny if you guys had a QA team all the obvious bugs and the bugs from other games wouldn't have been at launch. That or your QA isn't actually doing their jobs.
---
Looks like Bethesda require and have employed a 3rd Community Manager to come sprinkle smiley faces and positivity here as they lose their grip on community expectations. Lovely.
---
I found the best spot!
---
[G.R.E.A.T. C.A.M.P.S!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD84eDKvDCU)
---
New to the game, how do you even turn the light on? And I would definitely have hoped for more colors as well. 
---
Some decent plans. .50 prime auto, ultracite core assembly, and another I cant remember. And then of course a 1* hunters leather left arm...
---
Or just picking up every canister you come across for a lot less dedicated effort and acid.
---
OMG, a Bethesda person replied to my comment! I'm never washing this comment again!
---
So lonely that players seek out dead npc's :(
---
Remove a turret.
---
On the PS4 (not sure about Xbox or PC). You hold Circle.
---
Just as an aside question: Have the devs considered quest locking that event so people who haven't completed the questline up to that point can't join? Might help with the folks that run in, get one hit on her, and hide just to get quest rewards.
---
I'm well aware, all my characters that use PA have full sets stored on chassis. It's too difficult to do that with my mule, I have way too many chassis to keep track of what is what until they allow us to rename them.
---
I‚Äôm on PC, thanks though. I‚Äôll find it online lol
---
Maybe hidden set bonuses? 
---
Like in our case, pirate hat + leather armor + black powder pistol = 10% more effective alcohol? 
---
Is bobble head stacking being removed / fixed as well?
---
If not is it a major issue?
---
There's a patch tomorrow.
---
I can buy this garbage for ¬£8 right now, ¬£12 if I want to walk to my local game store.
---
Because you have to trust the person trading is going to finish the trade. People are assholes in this game. I'll never trade with someone until I can do an item for item trade. How is that not a flaw to you? Or are you one of those Griefers that claim you're a Raider, and would call that Raiding?
---
I didn't even know marsupial was a thing until i was around level 20.  Got irradiated at white spring, died and could jump really high when i respawned.  But I wiped it as soon as i took some rad x.  
---
Good to know!
---
Invest in a shotgun üòä
---
You're talking about how it is before weapons get nerfed.  I'm talking about after weapons get nerfed and there are still these people sitting there making it harder.   The claim that the queen is still quite killable should be tested against 10 low level people sitting inside the bunker, because that is what I saw when I went inside to heal up.  I went back out to fight and all these level 30 and lower people were still cowering in the bunker waiting for everyone else to finish up the work.  
---
I found one, but it was just a guy saying something like "Bring this suit back to camp, and I know you like jumping off of stuff that you usually can't, but it makes too much noise"
---
Just build a whole bunch of concrete blocks and stairs, none of those can be destroyed.
---
The crafting "shop" in the store area has a handful of them 
---
Yep I am using my TS +25% fire rate gatling in the exact same way! 
---
The problem is, you're making an assumption on how they operate. Since they won't communicate how they prioritize bugs, we have no idea. I'd love for them to explain why they left so many bugs in from beta, that I am forced to deal with every single play session without fail. But they won't!
---
My point is it wouldn‚Äôt be a case of that level 68 ghoul having picked up a drop from a low level ghoul spawn, and then you finding it after you kill that level 68, ghouls don‚Äôt do that. 
---
Scorched can and do that.
---
Bahahhaa
---
Yes x 4,712,842 
---
Imagine how cool it would be to perk swap or trade from your phone? 
---
Sure, I totally agree with needing better stability and getting rid of the ability to freeload. My only point was that if I was able to kill her back when she had 70% damage reduction, without any of the min/maxing, legendaries, chems, perks and serums that I have now, killing her now with 50% damage reduction and this small nerf shouldn't be a problem. 
---
She isn't meant to be easy, and TSE undeniably make her extremely easy, so if this nerf hits you that hard then I'd argue that you're not prepared enough.
---
I recommend bringing your Explosive and TSE weapons for a final ride, enjoying 1-2 shotting the largest and meanest of enemies, then as the final act minutes before the server shutdown, 1-shot yourself for the ultimate glory ;)
---
Too bad I only found my first ever Exposive shotgun just last Friday and I'm having a blast with previously spongy enemies.
---
Excellent! Not a bad first run then!
---
Ffff‚Äîk! That‚Äôs what happened the other night!
---
Lost a regenerating health piece of armor after doing that quest for the hell of it. Thought I sold it by accident because I didn‚Äôt realize it was gone till I got out of my power armor
---
Exactly. 
---
Thanks, but I'll pull it off eventually (I want to extend my playthrough.) Really appreciate the offer though. Grinding for screws is taking me through countless weekend grind sessions. Why rush?
---
Do dupers even exist anymore? 
---
Hey, where is that first picture taken? I'm on a mission to photograph every motorcycle in the game.
---
The handful of Interns still working on this flop need their 1 month of doing nothing I guess.
---
Those cabins are amazing when you find out how it works, but FUCKING TERRIFYING at 11:30pm with my friend joining my game without my knowledge, following me there, and then messing with me. I honestly thought it was some new enemy shit or maybe the Flatwoods monster.
---
The correct fix for this would be that if you're the owner of a workshop and another player is claiming the site, the following rules apply:
---
* If the "attacking" player leaves the workshop area by any means (walking, fast travel, or molerat quantum tunneling device), the claim attempt ends immediately and both players are no longer flagged for mutual PvP.  
---
* If the "attacking" player successfully claims the workshop, both players are no longer flagged for mutual PvP. If the original owner wants to reclaim their workshop, they need to initiate their own hostile takeover attempt.  
---
You can collect ridiculous amounts of resources just by grinding everyday....i am always worried someone will accuse me of duping!   For instance...black titanium seems rare, but noooooo its not! 
---
And yes....those mutations are fun stuff!
---
best alternative ive found has been a mining helmet. has the same choices as PA has.  (mr. fuzzy only has bright)
---
I use VATS for my melee character and to other players, it looks like I‚Äôm zipping across the screen when I‚Äôm close enough to get that 95% hit chance on an enemy. I was wrongfully accused of ‚Äúhacking‚Äù...on Xbox no less. 
---
I knew it was coming. I Just don't think it's fair to the rest of us. 
---
it seems that you must go even further than that if you do not want your camp picked up on relog.
---
we tried placing camps as close as possible, and when moving to another server, the 2nd person would get the notification that they cant get their camp
---
And just go vats/sneak and be doing 1 shots on everything tomorrow. Bloody and Unyielding for even more insanity, and overall more OP than TSE.
---
Umm... because video games are meant to be enjoyed?
---
Oh, my fault. I see what you are saying. 
---
Who can answer that besides you.  I never thought it was boring.  Why don‚Äôt you tell us why you think it is boring and we‚Äôll tell you if we agree or not.
---
Wait a second did someone kill you with a electifed mr. Handy blade recently?
---
[The pincer is aggressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQooCpmSJls)
---
Post-apocalyptic wasteland justice at its tastiest.
---
It never was and still is not but have fun doing wherever it is you do outside the game. :)
---
Cosplayer turned blizzard community employee 
---
Yep infinite loading screens were introduced in last patch and hard crashes and server issues were not resolved (ps4)
---
While I like the idea if a player run karma system, I dont trust the players to run it. A good idea though. 
---
I wouldn't  mind it work the other way. Go past max to go to min. Selling my over supply of RadAway will be easier going from 500 to 1 instead of me going from 500 to 499 all the way down to get to 50 or so.
---
Numbe 2 makes sense, it always happens to me when I‚Äôm using it in a crowd. Especially when I‚Äôm visiting the Watoga brotherhood vendor and that crowd of bots comes boiling out of the alleyway
---
No, a griefer is an asshole that camps spawn points, think Quake and its sequels. Cheats to get highly OP weapons and armor and just plain murder you. And does other dickish bullshit. Just because you don't get a shot off, that doesn't mean the one that did is a griefer. They are just faster than you. Not everyone that makes a kill is a dick. All true griefers are dicks. 
---
Ah so you're an RMT duper then? Well I'll be sitting pretty with my items and my account while you're enjoying your ban 
---
A reverse aggro table would be hilarious for afk as well.
---
I chased that friggin bot from white spring to the crashed space ship today.  On foot.  Took 700 rounds of ammo to kill it because it was so high up i couldn't hit it 90% of the time.  That was almost enough to make me uninstall the game.
---
There is no set damage; it's just inconsistent af.
---
Dupers cured cancer and ended world starvation! Got damn you Communist Dupers always trying to ruin the economy of Capitalism!!
---
Gary!
---
I... I don't get how that fits in the context of the conversation but no, I have yet to be killed with a Mr.Handy blade.
---
I was just thinking the same thing myself the other day!
---
First suggestions thread about PvP I've agreed with since the announcement. 
---
As an amendment to the players lose ALL weapons and armour though, that would make it difficult to do anything - unless we pre-stored mats to craft basic stuff. Replace current gear with non-legendary versions. 
---
im down. lvl 13 but we could worek it out. contact me @ AtomicMilkMan#6885 on discrd
---
I mean we're basically agreeing on the same thing, I just think that, if taken as far as you want to take it, might as well go all the way and remove PVP entirely from adventure servers.  No reason for PVP players to be on adventure servers at all by that point, so might as well go dedicated PVE and PVP and make everyone happy.
---
I think the Mothman I was attacked by had yellow eyes too, I don't remember, but I do remember it was the Stalking Mothman. One and only encounter in about 200 hours of play time. Scared the shit out of me.
---
So true.
---
They deserve to get perma banned honestly, wrecking the whole servers, duping and stacking bobble heads to two shot the queen before anyone else can get there.
---
Yep, not to mention the Instigating legendary prefix :)
---
This happens to me on PS4.  Last time it happened was a couple days ago in a SBQ fight.
---
We use the lvl 8 or whatever they're at now because it works, and see no advantage to lvl it up at this time. Optimally the could share max level 5 whatever perk card, but it's not important and going full try-hard is not needed for such an easy game. The fo76 has been out for over two months, if your still having issues with the learning curve just keep asking for easy mode like everyone else, beth will cave to the casual carebears eventually, just like ubisoft did with in the division.
---
Fun story on a queen run, we've been avoiding killing the queen too fast, since not everyone can get down there in time to tag her so I've been leaving her at \~10% or to the c' in scorch and letting the groupies finish it off(they had +20m). 5 +100, and a two 40-70's. Main group consisted of a lvl7, and 349.
---
I saw some explosive weapons being used so I fully expected them to kill her eventually, and told the them I'd jump in a fissure if they failed, with my 30 damaged mainframe cores, some scraps, and my hubris. [I lost.](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AgJfPUD6QVbhiwknQYDUXNuP5Wow) It's a drop in the bucket but its makes it painfully obvious that some players do not know more than spraying and praying, assuming they can buy/farm endgame gear, and breeze through queen content like they can with the other 95% of the game... Or they wanted me to jump in which i guess they won.
---
To clarify: The partner player is not needed, but appreciated on my part, they proved a function that lifts some responsibilities, and allows the dps to do more sustained damage.
---
I found the PC dickhead server yesterday. i was thinking it was a WOW what a great day I had in Church today, I better go play fallout and act like a complete fucktard now....
---
Any plans on having the camp system calm down when it comes to clipping ?? So many cool builds can be made with existing structures but the system won't allow it. :'(
---
Clipping is too strict.
---
Hit up Line in the Sand event for a couple fresh ones.  I find it far easier then hunting for generators/frames that still have them. 
---
look man, no one is forcing you to play this game, i understand you may hate it but playing it again and again even after you continue to complain about it doesn‚Äôt help you. if you really think that this game is harming your mental health then simply quit playing it. try moving on to new games to play, maybe even replay the ones that make you feel better. there is no reason for you to continue playing a game that you hate, none at all. 
---
I am sure other colors will show up in the atom shop eventually.
---
I'm a really fast reader.  What else will you have to occupy me? :)
---
I have high agility, maxed out marathoner, and speed demon.  Should really get gun runner as well :) 
---
Please don't do this, I don't want to wait 2hrs for someone to launch a nuke if they're struggling. I'll give someone 30 mins, then I'm coming in to do it myself. 
---
Abandoned waste dump in The Mire has two high level deathclaws inside that will drop 5-7 pieces each.    Unlimited source!
---
This works maybe one out of every ten times I try it when I run into this. Either sitting there and letting it spin works, or nothing does the rest of the 9 times.
---
At least with bloodied there is a risk involved (low health) so yeah it‚Äôs powerful but you are easily killed. Unyielding sentinel and bloodied is a pretty strong combo, possibly OP.
---
I would love to have the small letters set reduced, got a drug store and a long GT, gimme that percent reduction, baby.
---
Thank you for admitting I‚Äôm right lol
---
Yep I am mass leveling my final alt tonight before leveling gets harder. 
---
Its uploading now homie. I realise how feaceseous i may have sounded in that reply. It was an honest question and i didnt mean to poke fun or anything.
---
That's a pretty good idea! Hope they do that.
---
Just avoid all combat, environment interactions and opening your Pipboy.
---
Lol it‚Äôs dude. I think u read my reply as more brutal than I meant it too.
---
This would be great especially if it was real time with the perk swapping so I can easily switch my scrapper perk and my mod perks when getting to a station rather than sorting through on my console
---
Lol. Sucks for you. Why not go play fallout 4 instead and use the console to cheat so those of us that want to play properly don‚Äôt have to share a server with people like you? 
---
Super duper annoying...
---
Asaalso i crashed out at the end üòÇüòÇüòÇ guess ill be buying Skyrim in VR........
---
Any idea what we getting?
---
You just hold whatever button it is to open your pipboy
---
Wooww. We got The Flash in attendance. Dude, you must never need to fast travel, bet you beat the loading screens!
---
If it's really bad it could be the Targeting HUD on the PA.
---
I do enjoy being in a red circle while the sun is shining and I'm taking no rads. Might be related to those bugs where people see level 15 people in no radiation gear happily running around instead of dying instantly.
---
No. The items will be limited to the camp of the purchaser.  This was patched out a while back i believe as you used to be able to. 
---
It‚Äôs ONLY an issue because of duplication. If you stacked 10 explosive bobbleheads that you found on your own, then you deserve the boost. Duplication has allowed people to stack hundreds which is not normal and that issue will go away over time if they ever fix duplication permanently as people will eventually run out. I think they want them to be stackable in reasonable quantities.
---
I did manage to unlock and install the bayonet for the black powder rifle, at least back when that weapon was still relevant for me. (Now I have a Mutant's explosive Dragon).
---
They duped our jobs!!!!... Rabble rabble! 
---
Bloody Mess generally. Nerd Rage if you're below 20% hp. Adrenaline if you killed stuff recently. Demo Expert if they're explosive legendaries.
---
I think that's all the perks that would affect pip-boy damage numbers. Maybe Gun Fu but I haven't tried that.
---
What ever he buys from Atomic shop, he only use on his camp. But not anyone else's camp sorry
---
Not saying it's what they *should* do, but they can instance npcs to each player, depending on that players progress. It's fairly common practice in modern MMOs. In games like FFXIV, for instance you can be standing next to one of the major npcs, while you're teammate see nothing there, because the npc could be in completely different city, or even dead, for them, based on their progress through the main scenario.
---
Is a small turret camp behind the clubhouse at whitesprings considered greifing ?
---
Uninstall the Targeting HUD mod (or possibly Recon Sensors), trust me, that will fix it for you.
---
Yeah a bunch of trolls would run around giving everybody they see thumbs down 
---
Eh, Im not opposed to a heavy weapons buff, but you dont fix encounters that way.
---
What needs to happen is for scaling to be adjusted so that sub-50 characters scaled her MUCH less then a post 50 character. There needs to be a scaling curve sumilar to the exp curve such that a lvl 10 does alnost nothing to her scaling but a lvl 45 scales her ~90% as much as an end game character. 
---
Also important, this scaling adjustment is only for sub-50 characters. If we applied the same theory to lvl200s she'd never come down.
---
Bumps all armor repairs down to 1 ballistic fibre instead of the usual what? 5? Crazy!
---
Lmao
---
We are all in a vault experiment!!! 
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
This seems like another plan to try to punish pvp in this weird thing this forum has where this clearly should have been a single player game but isn't so people are trying to get them to enforce rules to make other people play in a way that makes them not do things you don't want. 
---
Stack that with the Party Boy perk and I'll be nigh unstoppable. 
---
FYI do mayor for a day and they become nice as pie! 
---
Ope didn't know it was that significant....I swore I just used 7 on my torso
---
rofl
---
Looool why u bully me? üòÇüòÇüòÇ its all g dude. The lag was real and i kept getting stuck on terminals but youll get the idea, ill link in this thread when its uploaded
---
Would be nice if Bethesda actually confirmed this as working as intended or a known bug.
---
If duplication isn't fixed soon it wont matter, people will have 200k of these damn things and be able to destroy anyone or anything that gets in there way.
---
What makes you say the duping issue will go away? You mean most dupers will get bored and leave or Bethesda will get a grip of it and stop it? They seem to be ignoring at the moment and haven't even confirmed it happens have they?
---
Buff the drops already bethesda. Sick of the trash loot. Especially off the Queen.
---
Extra Favorite menu would be great
---
Ok! I was kinda thinking no but wasn't sure as I've yet to but anything from the Atomic shop. Thanks for the reply!
---
Not that particular one. But I remember reading that  at least one dish can be built on.
---
Sorry I have seen this info a lot but I don‚Äôt have any pa head mod except light have cleared cache, rebuilt database and makes no difference. Fanboys (inc myself) have to admit the game had issues.
---
Only improvements I can suggest are avoid whitespring and nuke zones, if u want to take workshops join or play on same server as a friend.
---
Just so I'm clear, your saying you had a paper bag vanish without anyone removing it's contents?
---
Yep, it‚Äôs a massive reduction 
---
Same for Power Patcher if you use PA
---
If they were crouched/sneaking, you can't lock on to them. Or if they had the chameleon mutation and were currently phasing out. Only things I could think of.
---
Indeed it is. 
---
Ok, thanks for the reply!
---
What jacket is that you're wearing? Looks awesome! Nice guns too. 
---
It's considered worst than griefing! Next you'll ask if it's okay to calm next to Charlestown Station. 
---
People love the communication but be prepared for downvotes if literally anything bad happens, and dont take any of the super negative comments to heart
---
I have that at rank 1 with Max fix it good
---
If you want to keep them why would you put them in item boxes anyone can steal from? 
---
There are builds/weapons that are currently easier than TSE and won't be touched tomorrow. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen chameleon happen and am used to that, but this was running and jumping all over the place. Chameleon only works when crouched right? 
---
He duper that name! Don't trust him!! 
---
Are they aware of the new duping method crashing the server every 10 minutes?
---
I enjoy this game.  It was lazily built on an engine unsuited for online play, but the content, backstory, options and freedom are fantastic.  
---
Ok your username resembles that of someone i killed while they were houseraiding
---
Oh I forgot unable to loot :)
---
Meh. You don't have to be at too low HP for the dmg bonus to be more than enough.  And with all that agility you can just stay snaked and not get attacked.
---
The TSE nerf isn't small. It is a huge percentage change to both TS and E (100% down to 25%) the damage is essentially quartered. 
---
And it isn't my preparedness that is the issue. It is the server's preparedness that makes it an issue. 
---
Having max perks, armour chems and a TSE still could not bring her down if all of the under 30s on a server join the fight. 
---
I would be fine with the nerf to TSE as long as they make the Queen a level locked fight. 
---
That way everyone present contributed their fair share. 
---
Well, given that 99% of TSE weapons are duped and that they are a VERY common sight, I wouldn't really say it's paranoia. Far from it, actually.
---
Not top of that but really close to existing building. There is some spots that let you overlap things a littlebit and you can add all the different decorations but not doors.
---
What level was he? I've heard its a drop for lower levels.
---
It's still an issue even without duplication. You can easily buy 10 bobble heads for 1000c from players.
---
I highly recommend maxing both with your next level ups
---
&gt; Black Friday was last year btw, unless it's black friday every day all day. 
---
Umm... I was addressing this part of the post
---
&gt;Dropping the value of the game to less than ten dollars in a matter of days after release.
---
If you consider this game garbage, why are you even here? How sad things must be if this is where you choose to spend your time given your apparent dislike for the game.
---
It is only another system to be abused by asshats. Most lone wanderers probably won't have enough social interaction to overcome any negatives given by those who are trolls.
---
The ones that can probably help you are the same ones neck deep in fixing bugs as well. 
---
How-dee pard'ner.
---
While that may be true.. (I'll have to try it), if it's in the game we should be able to use it... Not, oh you have a PS4 pro, you have to get a big rock to use because what you want to use is bugged as frack!.... Sorry, not sorry!  LoL 
---
Actually you could be right I started using targeting hud a couple days ago and since then the Blue screens have started to get worse 
---
I'm sure some do avoid invites out of fear, but not all of them. I don't avoid team invites out of fear. I was avoiding them for a bit because of no mic. Mic is replaced now, but I'll probably still be turning down team invites on occasion either because I'm in the mood to go it alone that day or because my husband's on my team already and he's a bit more nervous around random strangers than I am. 
---
Nexus mods has a mod request section, your best bet would be throwing this up there. I'm still waiting on the Excavator Power Armor mod for FO4 as well.
---
The only one I keep on all the time is gunsmith and I might even take that off and move points around. I tend to only throw them on for repairs and not use the passive effects
---
There's also an issue if somebody else has the Targeting HUD other people experience it. So it's possible the bug could transfer between players if they are in close proximity of someone using one, if they don't themselves use one. But It's only a possibility. I know I crashed less when I scrapped mine. Just making a new one and still having it in my inventory didn't seem to help. I was still sometimes seeing the red glow. Maybe it was from someone else. So I just scrapped it just in case.
---
It‚Äôs more of just an idea rather than having 10 different stashes. And it would also be interesting to see the kinds of hiding places and creative trickery people come up with. Also people could set up stations in their camps with an open container for stuff to giveaway if they don‚Äôt want to trade but want to keep items in circulation. I want to add one to my base with a donation box too for anyone to donate or take what they need that I‚Äôm not worried about. 
---
&gt; At least with bloodied there is a risk involved (low health) 
---
With the high Agi you'd have with VATS crits builds on top of sneak perks "risk" doesn't even appear in the dictionary anymore.
---
sometimes you plug one hole and 3 more open.  happens with buggy code and/or differing levels of development/project expertise.
---
I think we are all hoping the make significant progress on the crash/freeze front.
---
It's tab on PC. Just hold it down
---
This just in: Nobody cares. See ya later radiator! 
---
That would be awesome. Surely it wouldn‚Äôt be hard as the game runs almost identical code for items. I mean power armor paints were already run from 76 into 4
---
While I agree the timing you suggest would be good for me as well, this game is world wide.  That means no matter what time they choose, someone will have it in the middle of their day.  It is much easier for the Bethesda dev team to push an update first thing in the morning in case there is a major issue they can revert the change or make a fix before the end of the business day for them.
---
I much prefer they ensure things are not completely broken, and fix it faster, by doing it this way!
---
I am getting tired of not engaging. I will be doing to them what they do to me. Don't dish it if you can't take it
---
Holy crap, this is great!
---
Also, can we have more options of what side we want the keypad on?
---
Weird, I guess the makers of Counterstrike, MOBAs and Fortnite really missed the mark with their video games then because according to some people here getting popped and losing it all isn't enjoyable.
---
Phoenix bot is a duper confirmed.
---
You said it doesn‚Äôt protect you from other player‚Äôs damage. I argue that it mostly does. 
---
Gonna have to tame a deathclaw and name it baba booey...
---
buggy af? No. More unstable than past patches? Yes. However, it seems anecdotally that a good chunk of that instability is due to dupers taking down the server.
---
The extra condition boost is given when the item is repaired by someone equipped with the relevant perk. Occasionally, items from drops/spawns come with condition above 100%.
---
Not many 'useful' mods left I guess then 
---
Something appearing as a shoot'em up raid dungeon for all intents and purposes, but with bundles of lore wrapped up neatly with a little bow right underneath the facade?
---
Even with bobblehead stacking?
---
I think he was like 55 ish..
---
Yeah, it's just a UI bug. Try selling something to him and it should refresh. 
---
I sure hope so. I had noooo idea they had been doing limited time Atom Shop stuff until the Blackbird PA paint... I happened to be way outta town for a while when that one was available and missed it completely. I‚Äôll live and move on lol but it can be pretty frustrating to miss out on cool stuff like that. I can‚Äôt be logging into this game every single day, lol. üòÇ
---
Maybe 60
---
Yes I lose where the body's are after I was done fighting
---
That happens to me a lot too. And then I‚Äôm just shit out of luck on whatever they had on them. I just hope it‚Äôs one that didn‚Äôt generate anything haha. 
---
Hope it helps with planning out your CAMP!
---
What's the matter? Somebody dupe your sweetroll?
---
&gt; award rewards based on contribution to the kill
---
Yeah, sure, lets reward dupers and people who bought from them.
---
Some are saying PVP has become the new "Endgame Content" - I know it has for me. Last night I went a half-dozen rounds with someone and we were fairly evenly matched; it was very exciting.
---
if you don't attack anyone they cannot kill you. Don't be afraid of other players, unless they shoot at you and you fire back you can smile and wave while they whack away at you with their pickaxe or whatever.
---
&gt; Edit 2: After thinking about it for some time, I feel like having the bot at the overseer camp might create some really unfair and unfun camping situations. So unless the overseer camp and surrounding areas don't allow PVP, it should be stationed at the exit of vault 76.
---
This was edited in before you replied to me... 
---
I can't believe this one is still happening. It was happening in BETA. That was more than two months ago.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what is needed for crafting higher level weapons and armor.  Used to be perks for that.  In this game that level automatically goes up as you apply points to intelligence? But I could be wrong.
---
For the legendary effect on armor, yes. But, not the mutation, I'm not totally sure how it works but some of my mates have it and they go transparent while standing and running around, but you'd definitely notice it.
---
Probably bugged if you didn't see em go transparent at all and weren't crouching. 
---
Common random encounter. While it is likely a bug, I hope that one day they build on it and give us a wondering deathclaw merchant. 
---
Don't tell me you're going to flood your bathroom and have sex with it...
---
That‚Äôs more of what I meant. Something that‚Äôs just minimal but very useful. 
---
Yes even with that. There‚Äôs a video floating around of someone with like 250k doing nothing to someone else in slap damage. 
---
Placing down an entire house from stored has been buggy at best since launch. You'll probably just want to scrap the blueptint and rebuild. 
---
Well it was kind of a given at the time.  If you do a google search and limit your searches to the dates of 2005 - 2011, youll find every single article talking about "free to play" is referring to a subsciption based mmo vs a non subscription based mmo.  
---
Logically think of it like this.  lets pretend MMO subscriptions don't exist at all.  So you have games you buy, and you have freeware.  Now lets say I had freeware and I also added a cash shop.  Why would I now call this freeware "F2P" after adding a payment model to it?  The term derived from us talking about MMO's losing the subscription model, and only there does it make sense.  Other games are free, some free games also have in game purchases, if anything, nintendo is right to say they should be called  "free to start" because thats qutie misleading anyway. It's misleading becaus the term didn't mean that to begin with, but a lot of time has passed since then, and those 5 year old boys reading about free to play games in 2009 are now adults who have their own opinions on what the word means :P
---
http://www.gamesbrief.com/2011/07/why-are-so-many-games-converting-to-a-free-to-play-model/  
---
So did we have this discussion back then?  What the difference between all tehse things was?  Yeah, we did.  We considered calling games like ESO "B2P" which meant you bought the game and then paid no subscripition, but that felt redundant and pretty much nothing caught on lol
---
Cap sinks please
---
I like paying with caps
---
Item trades are so sketchy still...
---
I've reported you to your local protectrons. Unfortunately, their AI is terrible, so they may or may not act on it.
---
It's happened to me a handful of times, on PC no power armor. 
---
I'm playing a VATS crit build with super high AP and refresh, so I tend to get permanently stuck in it since it doesn't drain all the way. Once or twice it's forced a CTD. 
---
In the Jan 17 notes they wrote about it. ‚ÄúWe want you to know that we take these exploits and those abusing them VERY seriously‚Äù. It goes on to say that players identified as exploiting aspects of the game through duplication or cheat engine stuff will be removed. It will eventually be gone completely but the damage is done. Currently, it seems that people duplicating and crashing servers in the process are flagged, like there is some system in place now that identifies that activity. Also people with crazy inventory weight are identified easily. These are just assumptions as Bethesda leaves a lot to the imagination with their communication.
---
We‚Äôll agree to disagree at this point. Have a good night.
---
I've had the nuke launch stolen from me twice.  I've only attempted it twice.  I stopped trying to launch a nuke a few patches ago, I just leech off of other nukes.
---
Holy shit Banshee-44!
---
Now that you've seen this, can you please tell the team about preventing other players who stumble into our camps from killing our passive "pets" 
---
Why should I spend hours, days of work trying to tame a single high level deathclaw, when that deathclaw can be killed in a instant when some idiot walks into my camp?
---
This is how I planned my character.
---
First up, go here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Then, create a load-out you like. For example, this is the [heavy/power armor build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c273ec6&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22pa0p80e82e12e60c52ic4ip2ih2id2s72at1ad2ls2lt2a03&amp;w=&amp;n=) I'm having fun with right now. It's not the most powerful thing in the meta, but I have a two shot 50 cal, sooo... it's fun.
---
Anyway, once you have a build you like, click the "roadmap" section at the bottom of the page. Now, the thing about the roadmap is, it's not an *actual* roadmap, it just tells you at what level each perk card becomes available. Using that information, you can now map out which card you'll pick at each level. Going back to my build, the first few levels look like this:
---
LEVEL | NAME | RANK | STAT
---
------|------|------|-----
---
1 | ???? | ???? | ???? 		
---
2 | Lead Belly | I | E
---
3 | Lead Belly | II | E
---
4 | Lead Belly | III | E
---
5 | Dromedary | I | E
---
6 | Dromedary | II | E
---
7 | Dromedary | III | E
---
8 | Picklock | I | P
---
9 | Gunslinger | I | A
---
10 | Gunslinger | II | A
---
11 | Gunslinger | III | A
---
Hope this helps!
---
Lol, damn...
---
Poor moo-moos. Damn scorched always plink away at my moos or my generator. 
---
Decent later stage game weapons require screws and shit to craft. You're not going to find any significant amount of a few specific resources like screws and springs there. Besides even weak as shit monsters aren't weak as shit anymore if you're naked with no weapon.
---
I guess I missed the RedRocket garage skin I‚Äôve been waiting for. Not even sure what else I‚Äôve been eagerly awaiting and have already missed. 
---
Maybe Rad Scrubbers (removes radiation from food and water) or VATS Matrix (10% VATS accuracy) might be more useful.
---
Bethesda: We would like to be more translucent in our patches going forward. 
---
Also Bethesda: We will have the patch notes available during the maintenance. 
---
i don't get this reference im sorry
---
Far Cry does it with a little x in the compass to show you which bodies you‚Äôve looted
---
Idea: Why not introduce the level.normalisation they use in PVP to the scorchbeast fight. Then low level players would be useful
---
 Alternatively, the event could be made prohibitively expensive to foin for low levels. Or the reward could be reduced based on level.
---
Yep I agree must have used 1,000 rounds today on one queen.  Only me shooting her in the air the other 5 watching.
---
Hey, I‚Äôll add you I can‚Äôt get online right now (adulting sucks) 
---
But look for Cupperman - I‚Äôll hit you up when I can get online. 
---
u/TemiasMercurial said it pretty spot on.
---
I've been playing since the Stress test. I've put several hundred hours into 76. I can't give an exact number, because Bethesda fucked up the tracking on the 7600 hour challenge, and for whatever reason it is the only game in my entire collection that doesn't show a play time stat (or any stat for that matter) on Xbox. In all that time, I've found one legendary weapon I could use, a 1 star Furious Combat Shotgun. At the rate I'm going, I'll never get a 3 star weapon I can use. My girlfriend also only has a 1 star legendary weapon she uses, and it isn't even her primary weapon. Her armor changes constantly because all our armor drops have been just as shitty too. Not even everything she has is a Legendary, because they've been such utterly useless effects. We can only have so many Assassins (we absolutely HATE PVP, we want to be left alone when we play) or Mutant Slayers or Junkies bullshit. We're done waiting for the RNG to give us something useful. I wear Power Armor exclusively, so there isn't any legendary armor for me (thanks Bethesda!). In all that time, we have seen less than 10 3 star legendary items between us. That's shit, pure and simple, especially since we kill 3 star legendary enemies all the time. They frequently drop nothing. Why am I wasting my time attacking them again? It's not fun having shit weapons and armor. Especially when people bitch about people not doing damage to the Queen. Well no shit I'm not doing anything, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T JUST TICKLE THE BITCH! Everyone else anywhere near my level already got their most likely duped TSE and can take her health down no problem. Seriously, every nuke zone I go to my girlfriend and I seem to always be the only ones without TSE's. Trading isn't worth the risk to me, since we can't trade item for item. I don't want to rely on a random person to be honest and finish the trade. People are dicks, as all the ~~Griefers~~ Raiders in this game are ample proof.
---
I certainly don't want top of the line gear for nothing. I don't want a pay to win game at all either. I want the hundreds of hours I've spent looting and killing to have something to show for. Right now, I don't, and neither does my girlfriend. Killing the Queen is a joke for loot too. How many plans does one guy need for Ultracite Explosive Vents? I want Calibrated Shocks and a Jetpack!
---
That happens to all of the vendors
---
Before they fixed it, I had marsupial, bird bones, and strange in numbers equipped. Which had the annoying side effect of letting you literally run through the air because your fall speed was so heavily reduced. I definitely got called hacker more than once.
---
if (queenalive == 1) prime(); else whitespring();
---
Never heard of rad scrubbers 
---
just use 1 piece of chameleon armour..
---
I'd be down for that!
---
Of course it is, there is a ton of duplicated stuff still floating around. It will take ending duplication, deleting high volume accounts (removing excess from market) and time for things to ever be close to what Bethesda intended.
---
Amen!!! My friends bring me along just because I picked up level 3 as early as I could. I‚Äôm Mr. lockpick. 
---
I‚Äôve watched some gameplay of Anthem and it looks solid. There are some server issues with the low player load in the demo though, so I‚Äôll probably wait until a few weeks after release to see how it‚Äôs looking. 
---
I‚Äôm most looking forward to The Outer World. Big fan of Obsidian, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what they‚Äôre able to do with Microsoft‚Äôs money behind them. 
---
Hmm maybe not in Fallout 76 then.
---
I love how positive this fanbase is. Love all the support üëç
---
Graham‚Äôs entertaining personality is priceless.
---
I guess so! You too.
---
Whenever you see 0 caps, try selling anyways. Usually it's a bug.
---
Grahm shares his wallet with the Watoga train station. If you've emptied either out within twenty hours, it's gonna be empty.
---
I get this from time to time. Turning my camera away from the enemy I was targeting fixes the issue immediately. 
---
C - Collaborative

R - Roleplaying

E - Experience  
---
My idea for the restaurant district patch to the T.O.W.N.S. system.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt seen this fix yet. It‚Äôs been all over. Didn‚Äôt you try looking?
---
\^This. Marsupial is easy mode against melee swarms unless you're stuck indoors.
---
Apparently the speedy receiver for the gatling is a lot better, but you'd probably need to find the gatling plan to unlock that. Also all the heavy weapon perks are high level so it's a bit of a struggle running them at level 20.
---
Turned out it was glitched, solo'd it just now anyway, but too many turned up and buffed the queen, ran out of time....
---
Uranium Fever is good for farming legendaries once you‚Äôre about lvl 25ish
---
Yup. I found an explosive Gatling plasma just in time for it.
---
Whatever, it‚Äôll still be good.
---
All 4 times I've been to WS shops, the one vendor had not 1 but 2 plans for bear skin rugs. 
---
Not sure what you mean.
---
XD
---
hmmm will have to re read them (ITV's) I was under the impression they had been very careful as to not say which exploits in particular as then they can't be held accountable to it.
---
That said, they have also said that exploits have been fixed in each patch so far, and yet the glaring one that is ruining the game is still present...i wonder what tomorrows patch notes will say.
---
On XBox, appreciate the offer though!
---
Nah. They‚Äôre just mad about melee in general now. From what I‚Äôve seen. 
---
Agreed, it‚Äôll still be viable for sure.
---
i have done the farm one in flatwoods so many times i think i can do it in about 90 seconds or less
---
Can we get a damn M4/M16, or some kind of attractive assault rifle. 
---
Or an easy fix would be that if someone is a constant griefer or asshole and gets "wanted" frequently, the game should flag it and when they get killed they lose everything in their inventory. Weapons, armor, meds etc. Or if you build up a wanted bounty more than say, 50 caps, you get the same penalty of losing everything you have on you.
---
Had a TS radium rifle for almost 100 levels. Never could unlock the suppressor on it, the odds seems so low when scrapping.  I felt like the fire rate really made this rifle a contender, but with the TSE and underserved TS nerf the guns dmg drops too low. Unfortunately retiring my baby, but hopefully we get some more balanced gun love from Bethesda soon.
---
My PSN is Snoogydoodles.
---
I'm referring to a scene from the move '[The Shape of Water](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-thorough-examination-of-the-shape-of-waters-sex-scene-and-fish-man-anatomy)'.
---
Just blue screened again
---
Why else do you think he has all those legendaries?
---
I have, it's just rare that I am in my P.A., and that's besides the point of Beth fixing yet another persistent bug..... 
---
Surely you can prove this is happening?
---
Spicyyy
---
Oh thanks!
---
I'm glad to hear it.  I don't honestly care for PvP all that much, but I do at least like taking out the occasional Wanted player.  But for me, it's obviously the PvE element I prefer as endgame content.  What we could use are more events and dungeons like could be found in WoW many years ago.  I say it like that because I haven't played since probably 2009-2010 and don't know what it's like now.  Anyway, just huge, multi-stage events that actually require a large number of players for at least an hour or two, or maybe more.  And for PvP, it'd be nice to see better arena like events that can't be crashed by random players.  Organized fights to the death that have spectators, basically.  That alone would probably get a lot of PvE players watching and even joining in once they see how fun it could be.  
---
Is it still considered wrong to have a camp there to help farm as long as i don't have turrets on it? Like just platforms to shoot from, benches, and a stash?
---
Yeah they have identified duping exploits and cheat apps or mods. Hoping for the best as I enjoy this game, despite any issues :)
---
Full server is what hurts.  The hint says 8 players, but 5 or 6 is just about right.  If the whole server shows up, she‚Äôs invulnerable.  
---
It‚Äôs the stacking that‚Äôs broken.
---
Oh I see. Yes, both times I‚Äôve sold to Watoga vendor. Thanks
---
Because there isn‚Äôt any. No ones claiming the npc‚Äôs do belong to anyone either. It‚Äôs common courtesy not to kill the legendaries before others can tag them. Being the only one to kill them doesn‚Äôt give extra exp, better rewards, anything. One of the guys in op‚Äôs story also laughed while doing it. Griefing. You don‚Äôt have to think it is if you don‚Äôt want too, there used to be people who thought the world was flat.
---
If you‚Äôre attempting to place down your whole camp that‚Äôs been packed up, if you have anything it it what‚Äôs clipping/glitched through anything, you‚Äôll get this message. Before moving it is a good idea to pack up any cramped items or things flush on walls as they often cause this
---
Where??
---
Just wondering, are the negative effects of the two-shot legendary effect being reduced to match the reduced positive effects?
---
Not everyone has all those recipes. I haven't bothered farming them because who gives a shit, I got my mod recipes and I farmed legendaries... why would I want regular gun recipes? I'd wager very few people bothered with gun recipes, in fact. Maybe I'm wrong though, who knows.
---
Again, letting people keep **all** their junk is too much. Please read [my next comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/akly0y/suggestions_for_survival_fa76_from_someone_with/ef6kvun/) in this chain.
---
Sad to see a bunch of people defending this pile of garbage, sorry its not that great.
---
Used to run weightless not for the mutation though.  As a PA main I wanted some light pieces for protection at times when I‚Äôm outside PA.  I just run a chameleon piece instead of the mutation.  Have since moved on from weightless pieces though...  vanguard is my preference now and a single chameleon piece.

Grrrrafton Day, Again!

Good caps and scrap for no work.

Jumping is not standing; searched a bunch of definitions for jumping and standing and didn't find an equivalence to both. Jumping can be done from a standing position, but that's as far as it goes. I'm not salty, I enjoy PvP (not your concern how or why), and would like it to be as fun as it can be within the limits of the game. And I know it doesn't appeal to most, and that's fine. I played quite a bit of high-level PvP in this game, which right now is people jumping up and down in the same dpot while shooting. Would be great, for me and hopefully others, if the upcoming PvP mode had more variety than that. Altering the effect to match the description may be a step towards that.
---
Ahhh, the ol Upper Duper Decker... it's power should not be underestimated
---
I think we have the same idea but I‚Äôll put it into simpler terms, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. When I hear this, I think about a community challenge, like in call of duty games where the entire player base has to do something like pick flowers a total of 1000000 times. Except picking flowers you‚Äôd need to donate resources. Let say there were several locations for TOWNS around the map 1-2 per biome, a player would pay 1000 caps to join each town and then they would be able to participate in the building/ rebuilding of an area. The community challenges for each area would be to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù a total of, X wood, X steel, X adhesive, etc. and a time frame is given like 1 week to acquire all of the items. If the goal is met then the players who joined/ donated get a free fast travel point. And if not the challenge resets. Preferably 1 location at a time and the whole event takes 1-2 months for all of the TOWNS. This would encourage players to get on so that they can have a new fast travel point. Let me know what you think. 
---
160 odd hours, level 62. So yeah a slow trickle of level ups, still havent finished the main story, just mainly exploring and just playing the game, no farming, no server hopping, etc.
---
Yay...
---
My Legendary - from - Legendary drop rate seems to be around 20% and I'm being generous. 
---
Same as, Bethesda need to man up though and start communicating properly though and listening to there customer base.
---
Releasing the same game without slap damage for the first new content is weak imo, could have lived with that if they were more open and transparent as Todd told people they would be.
---
Fallout 76 could have been the best mmo of all time....Bethesda missed a fantastic opportunity and decided to grab the fast cash (should have delayed launch)
---
I can easily enjoy myself just going around foraging and scavenging materials. When it comes to things like the loot system etc. and trying to get certain pieces of armor with the stats you want, it's just a lottery. There's no skill or even achievement in winning the lottery. It's just dumb luck. I could list off a few other things that bother me, but yeah. I like the game. I like a lot about it, but there are some things that are just not good. I can easily amuse myself though and enjoy myself playing. And for that they did a good job.
---
That's some good news. Finally a bug my girlfriend and I encounter regularly is getting patched. Now for the dozens of others we encounter constantly....
---
Cap Sinks are what we need.
---
Increasing the cap limit would only increase inflation, while the really hard to find items would remain trade only.
---
I just think 200 hours is way too much. 
---
See I wasn't going to buy the game because I just didn't like the look. Whilst there are some obvious flaws I can't really say I dislike it. The way I look at games is as long as I get an hours enjoyment for each ¬£ I spend then I am happy. In this case I got the game for ¬£20 ($26) a couple of weeks ago so by my own rules I only need 20 hours enjoyment for it to be worth it. I'm on about 10 to 15 so far and am level 22 so it is seeming like it will be good value for me.
---
Can confirm, fought vengeful mothman
---
Dropped nothing - might be bugged as of right now 
---
Don‚Äôt.   Due to a game design error they are only available for sale between levels 15-20.   The chance of receiving them as a random drop is infinitesimal.  Buy them on the secondary market.   The going rate is 1500 caps‚Äîa little more than one days worth of caps grinding.  
---
Happens to me when I‚Äôm in PA. I‚Äôm in Xbox btw.
---
Heavy weapons are just fun in general man
---
LoL. Did you just leave it there?
---
News of each new patch fills me with dread.  In all seriousness, for every one thing that's fixed with the patch, they manage to fuck up   a few more. 
---
Nuked White Springs yesterday and barely any ghouls spawned.  I thought maybe someone had beaten us to it, but in that case, there are usually meat piles all over the place. There were none. It was basically a dead and empty  nuke zone two minutes after the nuke detonated.
---
My team mate left the world then jumped back in. 100 percent if the time, this makes the ghouls respawn. 
---
For the first time ever in my weeks playing the game, it did not happen. 
---
It was a moment of weird and random dysfunction in a week that has been full of them.  
---
I mean I did buy the Racecar-bed, but that's mostly so I can talk to other car-beds.. 
---
I probably don't have an answer you're looking for, considering I made this post 3 days ago. 
---
Guess we will find out after the nerf tomorrow huh?
---
Yeah they have missed the mark with communication and development of an existing game thus far. Content content content. Need much much more and fast if they want to keep players. PvP servers could have waited. Adjustments to pvp on existing servers could have been improved.
---
There‚Äôs a few quests (one even called something about hunting cryptids) where you get locations on the map to hunt the rarer creatures. One is a daily in the Mire and another is accessed in one of the terminals in the ski resort area
---
Pretty sure Bethesda would be interested in a programme that looks in peoples inventory's to see what people have to much off as well ; )
---
No coder myself, Bethesda definitely can't handle it. I'm pretty sure the modder's could have it out and working in a  few days though :(
---
Just orbital strike her back to hell. Some high level players i joined did it once and it worked fine....that why me and my friend have 30 orbital strikes saved up for our first time persosanlly launching the nuke on prime
